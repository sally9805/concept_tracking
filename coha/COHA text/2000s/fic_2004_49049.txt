JUST OUTSIDE CUSTOMS , past the sign welcoming her to Fall 's End , Homestead , Ann stopped , abruptly unable to move . The anxiety experienced during the shuttle flight down now escalated ; her pulse raced and her hands became moist . <p> People moved around her , a few casting annoyed glances over their shoulders at her as they hurried into the main port arcade . She knew she was getting in the way , but she could not make herself take another step . She felt her breathing quicken , heading toward hyperventilation . <p> Far back in her mind , a routine detached itself with a perfunctory What in hell ! For a second her vision doubled , then the color seemed to fade and a sense of being two people distracted her . <p> " Okay , what 's the problem ' ? " <p> Setis . <p> Then she saw them . Nonhumans , just a few . This was Homestead , after all , deep in human space , close to Sol ( to which Ann now desperately wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! , one Menkan , and a pair of Rahalen . <p> " So ? " <p> A fast exchange of data - memory ? - coursed through her mind . <p> " Xenophobia . You should have told me . " <p> I 've never told anyone . It 's nobody 's business . <p> It became clear then that Ann had even kept it from herself , buried it under layers of rationalization and habit , and over the years had simply ignored it to the point of forgetting . Till now . <p> " No seti on Earth , except in the diplomatic enclaves . But this is n't Earth . How did you expect to get through this without making allowances ! " <p> Did n't think about it . <p> " No worry . That 's - why this monitor routine is in place , just in case . We can work with this , but it would have been better if we 'd known in advance . " . . , <p> Another exchange occurred , handshakes and whispers from one part of her mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles relaxed , and she was able to move forward . <p> " Thank you , " she said under her breath . <p> That 's what we do best , a voice seemed to reply , we listen .... <p> She found a pub with a view across the plains to a low line of mountains glowing gold against a blue - gray sky . Tau Ceti shone marginally warmer than Sol , so the greens seemed slightly yellow and the reds too dark . The view reminded her of the Serengeti ... except . <p> She picked out collections of tall tubelike structures dotting the plain , rising from the yellow - green grasses . From time to time , a cloud of off - white scintilla burst from one of the openings to disperse in the breeze . And along the outside base of the window , bluish insects tumbled over each other , trying to find purchase on the smooth surface , falling off , struggling , leaving faint viscous smears where they had clung . <p> More details worked at her newly established calm . The gravity was slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination of sawdust and damp moss . Around her she caught other accents , from other worlds .... <p> She ordered a scotch , neat , and settled in a booth to take in her first sight of Homestead . <p> To another part of her the landscape seemed very familiar . <p> That felt wrong . She ran a quick diagnostic on the overlay . Off to the left of her vision , neon green telltales floated , glowing confirmation . Occlusion was optimal , the host personality showed no sign of bleeding over , even after its necessary intrusion to overcome her paralysis at the sight of aliens . Mollified , she closed the dialogue scroll and resumed looking at the landscape . She felt embarrassed about the episode . An oversight on her part , but she honestly had not thought about it in so long .... <p> Her drink arrived and she opened her pack . The booth possessed a polycom link into which she jacked her own portable unit . The small screen cleared and her short itinerary scrolled up . <p> Willem Karkaris topped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . all she needed to do was touch the CONTACT icon next to his name and she could let him know she was on Homestead . She had sent no word to expect her . Now that she was here , she still hesitated . After the unexpected reaction to the presence of seti , what else might she have suppressed ? She withdrew her finger , lifted the glass , and looked back at the scenery . <p> Seven years , she thought , you 'd think it would be long enough for some perspective .... <p> Maybe . But now that she no longer had time , perspective was elusive , impossible . She finished the scotch , delaying , trusting that instinct would see her through . <p> Nothing . <p> She raised the empty glass till the bartender saw her and nodded . She set it down , a little too hard , and jabbed her finger at Willem 's icon , a little too hard . The portable unit skittered several centimeters over the table . She grabbed it and pulled it back . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The small screen made it difficult to be sure , but Ann saw surprise in his face . That , and a touch of anger . She felt mildly gratified . <p> " Will , hi , " she said . <p> " Ann ? " <p> " Who else ? " <p> He frowned , his pale gray eyes narrowing . His light brown hair was much shorter than the last time she saw him , and his face showed a few more lines , but he looked mostly the same . Especially frowning . <p> " Where are you ? " he asked . <p> " Fall 's End . " <p> " You 're here ? " he glanced off - screen . " Right . I 'll come get you . If you want , ! mean . " <p> " Since I 'm not sure how to get to your stead .... " <p> " Be about a half-hour . " <p> " I 'll be here . " <p> But why ? he wanted to ask . She saw it , clearly as if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the menu , offering local services and information , came up . She toyed with booking a shuttle back up to the transit station and going back to Earth . Or steeling herself to head further out , maybe all the way to the secant . <p> Then what ? " Ann Myref " would fade in time as the overlay broke down , and the poor host would be stranded somewhere , underfunded , with no way back . <p> The second scotch was gone . She considered a third , but decided to get a coffee instead . Being drunk when Willem arrived might be a bad idea . <p> Being totally sober might be worse , she thought . <p> She spent the next half hour downloading data about Homestead . The portable would belong to the host after the contract ran its course , and she might need the information . <p> Willem arrived ten minutes late . he stood in the entrance to the pub and for a few seconds Ann thought he would turn and leave . <p> The shock in his eyes faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way here , " he said , " I still did n't quite believe it . " <p> Ann gestured to the opposite seat . " So you came to prove me an illusion ? " <p> " Illusion ? No. " he glanced at the portable polycom and her cup . " I 'm not sure what to say first . " <p> " Say what you want . What 's the first thing that comes to mind ? " <p> " Why are you here ? " <p> " Ah . To business . I 'm here to see you . " <p> " Because ? " <p> Ann laughed . " What , you do n't trust me ? " <p> " Trust is a finite resource . What you 're asking for is faith , and I never really had that . So I 'm left with requiring proof . You never do anything without a motive , this I know from experience . And I have to wonder what motive would be strong enough to get you to leave Earth and come all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood collapsed . She had intended to tell him . gradually , with kind words and a gentle attitude . <p> " I 'm a codicil , " she said . " Ann Marie Teresa Myref died a week ago , Earth local time . " <p> The shock in his face gratified her . " Dead ... , " he said . " How ? " <p> " Nerve degeneration . It started with flashes of pain along my forearms and numbness in my fingers . When I could n't hold a stylus for more than ten minutes , I saw the meds . New strain of virus , they told me . No cure . At first , though , the prognosis was generous . Ten more years with minimal impairment , then a gradual worsening for another five to ten . But then it took a turn for the unpredicted and I was in a float chair before I knew what happened . Hell with that . I have no patience for suffering . " <p> " You never did . Yours or anybody else 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism . " I 'm not the one who could n't adapt . " <p> " You did n't this time . " he shook his head . " So , how does this work ? I mean ... who are you really ? " ' <p> " Ann . " <p> " No , no , I mean the person wearing the - what do they call them ? - the overlay . " <p> " It does n't work that way . She 's not part of this at all . I 'm Ann Myref . " <p> He grunted . " You look like Ann . " he leaned forward and made a show of examining her features . " Same shade of hair I remember , same freckles ... this kind of work must pay well . " he sat back . " All right . I 'll play along . Why are you here ? " <p> " We have unfinished business . I did n't want to leave any dangles . " <p> " Very Ann . Did it occur to her that some things never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refer to me in the third person . " <p> " I would n't if I knew who you were . " <p> " I 'm Ann . " <p> " Ann 's dead . If I understood you correctly . " <p> " Physically . For all intents and purposes , though , I am Ann Myref . " <p> ' " All intents and purposes .... ' I never fully understood that phrase . " he smiled . " Forgive me , maybe I 've become morbid over the last seven years . I have to know - who 's wearing Ann ? " <p> She slapped her hand on the table . " It does n't work that way ! " She glanced around the pub to see if anyone turned to look . She closed her eyes then and sighed . " This is n't easy . " <p> " No kidding . " <p> " You do n't have to make it harder . " <p> " Me ? " he chuckled bitterly . " Look . Whoever you are , the woman who hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , no doubt she paid you well , but she did you no favors . She 's - was - a callous , self-obsessed workaholic who thought she could run everyone 's life for them . Even now , after she 's dead , she wants to make sure my life is the way she thought it should be . Well , I 'm sorry . To quote you , it does n't work that way . Some things stay broken . " <p> " Only if you ca n't figure out how to repair them . " <p> He looked skeptical . " From you that 's rich . " he sighed . " You have to ask if it 's worth it . Better maybe to just throw it away and get new . " <p> " Is that what you did ? " <p> He frowned , then started to stand . " Sorry you wasted the trip - " <p> " Will , please . " She reached out , but stopped short of touching him . " I 'm a codicil . This is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare a little time to find out what it 's about before you send me packing . " <p> He did not want to , she could see that . But the longer he hesitated , the more his conscience worked on him . Willem Karkaris had always considered himself fair before anything . he fell short often , she remembered , but he always tried . It felt oddly good knowing that about him . <p> " All right , " he said . " Come out to my place . You can at least see that I 'm fine . " <p> Willem drove at a steady clip over roads that seemed only recently paved , the ground effect transport sliding between low hills that gradually showed the signs of agriculture , native flora steadily displaced by recognizable strains of Earth crops . he left the main road after nearly twenty minutes and shot up a narrower stretch into vine - covered swells . <p> He pulled onto a broad pad before a wide , two - story house with a magnificently sprawling roof . A long building stood nearby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motiles loaded flats . A dog stood at the top of broad steps on the encircling porch of the main house , its tail wagging happily . <p> Ann shouldered her single pack and looked out at the surrounding hills . <p> " It 's a bit dry right now , " Willem said . " Rain 's late . Maybe just as well . " <p> She followed him into the easy shade of the house . Willem still liked blues and various shades of violet , mixed with natural woods oiled to a high sheen . Geometric patterns covered the furniture in dizzying profusion . Neoromantic realist art broke over the walls - heroic images of mountains , nebulae , oceans , and people under nature 's threat . <p> Ann spotted something to the right of the main window . A shadow box , small and nearly lost amid all the rest of the decor . Within its compact sections she saw bones , sticks , pebbles , torn paper , and handwritten notes , collectively composing an allegory of sorts . She recognized a number of allusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms are on the second floor , " Willem said . " Pick whichever one you want . " <p> Ann set the pack down on the floor and walked to the rear of the house . The porch , she discovered , encircled the first floor . She stepped out to gaze at the vineyards . <p> She heard Willem stop beside her . <p> " You did it , " she said . " This is what you wanted . " <p> " Mostly . " <p> " You did n't need me after all . " <p> When he remained silent , Ann looked at him . he wore a complex expression , part puzzled , part hurt . he exhaled slowly and shrugged . <p> " I have to finish supervising this load , " he said . " Go make yourself comfortable . I 'll cook later . " <p> Alone , Ann felt herself relax . She leaned on the railing and let the view suffuse her . Willem had talked about this all the time they had been together - land , vineyards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property on Earth and Ann refused to leave the planet of her birth . What had begun early on as an attempt to find Willem a parcel in Sol system had turned into a career for her , drawing her further away from the few dre.ams they had shared . One day she looked back and saw that she had become very wealthy dealing in land - most often land she herself never saw except by commlink - and Willem had already found a place out-system . <p> He had wanted her to come with him . She would not even consider it . he had not understood . What had begun as a minor irritation between them turned into a test of feelings - and they failed . <p> She returned to the living room and stood before the shadow box . They had not fought often , but the intensity of their few battles more than compensated . After the last one , Willem had simply walked out . <p> Did n't even say good-bye ... maybe he thought I 'd follow ... arrogant jerk .... " Sticks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and headed up the stairs to the second floor . <p> She shoved open one of the oak - paneled doors and stepped into a cozy bedroom done in ambers and greens . She set her pack on the cedar chest at the foot of the large bed and shook her right hand to revive the circulation . <p> From the window she could look back along the road by which Willem had brought her here . Except for that and the house around her , it seemed humans had left no imprint on the land other than the too - neat rows of vines . Tau Ceti bathed the landscape in warm light . Pristine , she thought , though she knew that eighty kilometers south lay Fall 's End and a spaceport . But the illusion pleased her . <p> She turned from the window and felt suddenly tired . <p> " Is there a house intelligence ? " she asked aloud . <p> " Yes , Co Myref , " a voice replied . <p> " Hm . Good . I 'm going to take a nap . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course . " <p> Ann pulled off her boots and stretched out on the bed . <p> He looks good , she thought as she drifted to sleep . Pity .... <p> The house woke her four hours later . Ann got out of bed and stretched , feeling stiff . Her back ached dully and her neck felt gripped by a large , powerful hand . <p> She showered and felt much better . Gazing in the mirror , though , toweling her thick red hair , she thought she looked pale . For a moment she experienced a sense of dislocation , as if the face she saw belonged to someone else . Pale green eyes , small nose , a faint scar over the left eyebrow . Freckles . She blinked , frowning , and the sensation faded . <p> Overlay slip , she decided . Another diagnostic would be a good idea , but as she dressed she experienced none of the third person impressions usually accompanying a bad fit . Leave well enough alone .... <p> She carried her poly com downstairs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smelled garlic and peppers , Bacian oil and curry . <p> Outside , Tau Ceti touched the edge of the hills , gilding the landscape in gold . Ann set her portable on the windowsill and stared . She wondered why she felt so drawn to this place . She had spent a lot of time and capital on Earth building a home very different from this , and till now had felt satisfied with the results . <p> " I trust you 're hungry , " Willem said , entering the room . " Dinner is served . " <p> He led her through a broad archway into a dining room . One wall opened to the porch , letting the early evening light fill the space . Motiles carried the trays . <p> " If I had n't been , " Ann said , " I would be now . " <p> While the machines set plates on the table , Willem busied himself with a bottle of wine . <p> " Yours ? " Ann asked . <p> He nodded . " Five years old , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nortons would thrive in this soil , but after a slight modification in the acidity and phosphate content , they 've done very well . " The cork came out with a pleasant pop and he filled her glass with the rich red liquid . " We have sauteed Nine Rivers eel , Cetian moss cakes , fried mussels , fresh sourdough and olive oil , and creamed fela berries . " <p> " A feast . " She raised the glass and sniffed , then took a mouthful . " Excellent . " <p> He smiled slightly and poured his own glass , then sat down opposite her . The motiles finished serving and trundled out of the room . <p> He raised his glass . " Welcome to my home . " <p> " Thank you . The place is .. . beautiful . " <p> " I could never have had this on Earth . " <p> " Oh , I do n't see why not . The only problem was money . " <p> " Then , yes . But .... " he glanced to his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light . The air . " <p> " It 's not Earth . " <p> " No ... it could n't be . " <p> " Close enough , though . " She tore off some bread and dipped it in the dish of olive oil beside her plate . Chewing , she sliced the eel . <p> " In your expert opinion ? " he asked . <p> Moss cake followed eel into her mouth . She chewed slowly , letting the flavors mingle and linger . <p> " I suppose , " Willem said , " you wo n't be opening offices here . " <p> " Is that supposed to be irony ? " <p> His face danced through a series of expressions , small shifts of the mouth and eyebrows , and she knew he was sorting responses . It seemed to take longer than she remembered , but perhaps he had more to think through . <p> " I suppose , " he said finally . " I 'm just extremely puzzled about why you 're here . " <p> " Can you wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> A smile flickered across his face and he nodded . <p> They ate in silence . Ann remembered this , too - many nights , especially toward the end , when everything either of them said came burdened with so many interpretations , when it was easier to be still rather than risk another altercation . <p> Maybe I should just wrap this up tonight .... <p> For dessert , Willem opened another bottle of wine - a white this time . he glanced at Ann 's polycom as he poured . Ann leaned back in the chair , comfortably sated , watching him . <p> " That was excellent , " she said . " You always were a good cook , but this ... you 've outdone yourself . " <p> " Maybe instead of living with you I should have gotten a job as your chef . " <p> Ann sighed . Tau Ceti had dropped below the horizon and left the dining room bathed in a cool afterglow from the twilight sky . Small lights winked on near the ceiling , not bright enough yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to clear away the dishes and clean up ; quietly and efficiently , dancing through their routine while Ann and Willem regarded each other across the table . <p> It would be so easy to just fall right back into it , she thought . Instead , when the last motile left the room , she took her polycom from the chair and set it on the table . The top swung up and the access panels glowed softly . She tapped a few commands and data appeared . <p> " There 's a few items we need to deal with , " she said . " You 're in my will . I 've left you some things . " <p> Willem 's mouth opened . he looked genuinely surprised he straightened in his chair and raised his glass . <p> " First off - " she began . <p> " Wait . " Willem held up his hand . " I 'm sorry . I find this all very disturbing . I mean - how does this work ? You are n't Ann . You told me she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table . " Ann Myref died on Earth . Before she did , she encoded her persona and hired seven of us to wear the overlay to take care of certain details left unfinished before her death . She had been confined to a support bed for eight months . She could not physically tend to this herself . So I and six others are carrying out her final wishes . The overlay is a full personality recording . That 's a profound simplification , but it 'll do . This host and the others went through minor physical modification to resemble Ann as closely as possible . Before you think otherwise , this is done as much to maintain the overlay as for any kind of deceit . When I look in the mirror , I see who I am , it reinforces the persona , maintains it . It also makes the entire experience more personal for the recipients of these visits . Would you believe me if I had n't looked like Ann and told you who I was ? " <p> " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her right hand , dismissing the comment . " There 's a time limit . I wo n't be Ann Myref for long . So when our business is concluded , at some point the host personality will reemerge and assume control again . " <p> Willem frowned uncomfortably . " Why did n't you just send for me ? " <p> " Would you have come ? " <p> " I - " he hesitated , then shrugged . " Maybe . I do n't know . " <p> He studied her , eyes narrowed . " You know , the woman you 're doing this for was a controlling , manipulative , self - serving - " <p> " Stop it . You already pointed that out and you know that 's crap . You 're not even saying it with conviction . " <p> He flinched , as if a charge had coursed through his entire body . He raised a hand , fisted it , and set it on the edge of the table . " All I wanted was to be with you . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have stayed . " <p> " You 're not listening . I wanted to be with you . What is me , what I am , included having this . " he waved toward the twilight - black hills . " This is part of what I am . To give this up would have meant crippling myself . " <p> " And I would n't leave Earth . That was part of who I am . " <p> " Why not ? Look at this place ! ' Close enough/ you said . For all practical purposes it 's no different ! " <p> " We went over this . " <p> " Often . And we never resolved it . You never gave me an answer . But there you sit , and if I am to believe that you really are Ann , then this is impossible . Ann would never leave Earth . " <p> " Death puts things into perspective . " <p> " You had to die before you could do this ? Were you dying when you made the encoding ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> His breathing came hard , strained . " That must have been terrible . " <p> " Pretty bad . " <p> " Who was with you at the end ? " <p> " Meds . A couple of attorneys . " <p> " I would have come . " <p> " Seven years , Will . You never did . I was n't that hard to find . " <p> " Ditto. " he stood . " Now it 's too late . Nothing we say here will make any difference . " <p> " Do n't take that attitude . " <p> " Ann 's dead . You are n't her . You 're just a mannequin. " he grunted . " You know , it 's actually painful looking at you . " <p> " Then let 's conclude this so I can leave . " <p> " There 's nothing to conclude . Anything I might have wanted from Ann , you ca n't give me . " <p> " What ? seems to me we left a few things unsaid . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll just have to remain unsaid . " <p> " Will , dammit , I am Ann ! " <p> " No , you 're not . And this is really not very pleasant . I 'm glad you enjoyed the meal . You can spend the night , but I 'd appreciate it if you 'd leave tomorrow . Early . " <p> Ann slapped her hands on the table . " You have n't changed a bit . " <p> " And you ca n't . Good night . " <p> " Will ! " <p> He walked through the panoramic opening , onto the porch , and out of sight . <p> FIREFLIES , OR something like them , sparkled across the blackened landscape . Occasionally , several of them fell into formations and swept through the darkness , a cloud of pulsing light arrowing somewhere , then breaking up just as abruptly . Ann sat on the porch with a glass of wine and her polycom , for a time fascinated by the stars and their flickering reflections below . Tau Ceti was not that far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the sky seemed odd all the same . <p> Her polycom chimed and she looked at the small screen . Insertion into the house system , it informed her , would set off a series Of alarms . Willem would know . The machine assigned a low probability to getting around all of them . Did she wish to proceed ? <p> Who would have thought the wine business required so much security ' ! <p> She checked the specs her polycom provided and grunted to herself . he had simply bought the most expensive and comprehensive package . Typical . all or nothing , like so much else Willem did . <p> She canceled the probe and shut down the polycom . No matter in any case - she had to talk to Willem , that was the contract . What Ann Myref wanted to give him , he had to accept personally . <p> Was it really so bad ? <p> She had gone over the memories of the relationship and the breakup during the voyage here . Perhaps time had blunted the sharper edges , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she could not understand Willem 's continued anger . She had moved on , and clearly so had he . It seemed reasonable that now , seven years later , there ought to be some neutral ground upon which they could talk . <p> " Some things stay broken .... " <p> Things had all happened quickly then . Her business had grown exponentially after she had tapped into the trend of the offworld rich returning to Earth to buy property as status symbol . There were many enormously wealthy people scattered among the colonies and seemingly overnight they all wanted a sliver of land on Earth - just because they could afford it now . <p> For a time , she had thought Willem left out of envy . But she decided not - he could be petty , but not that way . No , he had genuinely wanted this , what he now had . At the time , the price for it on Earth was beyond their reach . No matter , he told her , there 's plenty offworld . <p> The idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her reaction at Fall 's End , in the port . <p> But I still wanted to give you your dream . .. now that I can , you wo n't even talk to me .... <p> He said she had never given him an answer . That sounded ridiculous . all the fights , all the terse conversations , all the times they wrestled over this . She had told him time and time again - <p> She brought up the overlay menu again . Against the night it glowed a brilliant green . She chose the REVIEW function . For a few seconds it seemed that she remembered nothing . Panic began - and ended as abruptly with a dialogue space opening between the host and the overlay . <p> " At what point will my contract be considered fulfilled ! " <p> As stipulated , upon acceptance and transfer of bequests . <p> " He wo n't discuss it . " <p> That 's my problem , not yours . <p> " I ca n't be you forever . The overlay will start to deteriorate . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract requirements will void payment . <p> " Then that 's my problem . What if you ca n't solve your problem ! " <p> Consideration will be made . A contact number is filed in the case of overlay failure . <p> The space contracted , the separate halves of her persona stood apart for a few moments , and then " Ann " reassumed awareness . She felt unsettled and dissatisfied . <p> She closed her polycom and finished the wine . <p> As she stepped back inside , she heard glass breaking . Setting the polycom on the dining room table , she pushed through the door to the kitchen . <p> Willem knelt on the floor , carefully picking up shards from a puddle of dark red wine . An open bottle stood on the countertop opposite the sink . he looked up at her ; light caught in the tears nesting in his eyes . <p> " Forgive me , " he said , his voice softly slurred . <p> " You should let a motile clean that up , " Ann said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll clean it up . You should clean up your own messes . Otherwise .... " he jerked his hand up , wincing , and sending the handful of pieces flying . Ann danced back . " Damn , " Willem said , fingers in his mouth . <p> " Told you , " Ann said . She walked carefully behind him and took his shoulders . " Come on . " <p> He got to his feet , wobbled briefly , then shrugged her off . <p> " I can walk , " he said , stumbling back against the counter . he looked at his cut fingers . " Not bad . I 'll live . " he looked at her , frowning . " You 're still here ? " <p> " I 'm leaving in the morning , remember ? " <p> " Ah . That 's what I said . " he grinned . " Remember ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> He blinked , the grin fading . " You 're not Ann ... she 's gone . But you know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything . " <p> " Then you know she took the easy way out . " <p> Ann stared at him . " How ? By dying ? " <p> Willem nodded . " And leaving the mess for someone else to clean up . " he sighed . " I know a little about that . I did n't clean up my own , either . " <p> " I am cleaning up my messes . Why do you think I 'm here ? " <p> He laughed . " Uh uh . Ann did n't clean ' em up . She arranged to have you do it so she could go out with a clear conscience . That 's what she was good at - arranging things - that 's why she was successful . So at the end , she arranged to believe everything was settled , completed , finished . If you failed , it did n't matter . Sie could choose to believe you would n't . Mess tucked away where she 'd never have to see it again . " <p> " Is that how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You did n't even say you missed me . " <p> Ann felt her patience slipping . A motile rolled into the kitchen , hesitating at the proximity of humans to the mess on the floor . Ann put a hand on his arm . <p> " Come on , " she said . " We need to take care of that cut . " <p> He pulled his arm away petulantly , then acquiesced and let her direct him past the motile , into the dining room . She sat him down at the table and went to the bathroom . She found a bottle of healant and a box of bandages and returned to Willem . <p> He watched her tend the cuts , cleaning them , spraying the healant , and applying the bandages . She tried to gauge how drunk he was , but it was impossible after all these years . I might have known once , just by the set of his mouth , the way he blinked ... too much time has passed .... <p> " Why did n't you send word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I know . " <p> " Then - ? " he looked puzzled , then shook his head . " Has there been anyone else ? " <p> " A few . No one like you . " <p> " Maybe that 's a good thing . " <p> Ann sighed . " I hated you . You took off , I hated you . It passed . Nothing original . I imagined you hated me . " <p> " Not for a long time . " His face contorted briefly . " I just wanted you to come with me . " <p> " I could n't leave Earth . " <p> " Why ? " <p> Ann 's patience snapped . " Willem , we 've been over this - " <p> Willem held up a finger . " No . We have n't . " <p> " Yes , we have . It 's all we fought about at the end . " <p> Willem shook his head slowly . " We fought - sure - but you just said you could n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , stunned . She remembered the arguments , the bitter rituals of accusation and rejection . At some point during all that she was certain she had said .... <p> " Excuse me , " she said , standing . She walked out onto the porch . Leaning on the railing , she opened the dialogue once more . <p> " So did youl " <p> Tell him ? Sure , I - <p> " No , review it . Did you actually say the words ? Or did you assume he understood ? " <p> Scanning memory . .. no . I never actually said the words . <p> Ann watched the flickering in the night , remembering scenes from their last few fights . Finally , she closed down the dialogue and went back to the table . <p> Willem had not moved . he looked up when she sat down . <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said . She cleared her throat . " I could n't leave Earth because I was afraid . " <p> " Afraid .... " <p> " Terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He almost laughed . " You were never afraid of anything . " <p> " Is that what you thought ? " <p> " You never ... you never told me you were afraid . " <p> " I was afraid of that . " <p> " You never said . " <p> " No . " <p> " To anyone ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Not even yourself . " he nodded , as if he understood . " So all you could do was fight . " he drew a deep breath . " When you love someone .. . I wanted to be enough for you .... " <p> " So I would n't be afraid anymore ? " <p> " Something like that . If I had known .... " <p> " If you do n't know what it is you have to do , you 're not responsible for not doing it . " She touched his hand . " I never told you . It 's not your fault . " <p> He turned his hand over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , Ann thought she saw a glimmer of skepticism . But it faded . <p> He stood . " I need to be alone for a while . Whatever .... " he waved at the polycom . " You can tell me about it in the morning . " he paused at the doorway . " Thank you . " <p> HER SCALP ITCHED in the morning . Her mouth felt cottony and she staggered to the bathroom , half - blind through a kind of spun - glass haze that coated her <p> She found a towel and soaked it in warm water , then pressed it to her eyes as she sat on the toilet . Her bladder felt full to bursting and her release was long . She shuddered a few times . <p> Finally , she could see clearly . She remained seated and idly scratched her head , letting the sensations of sore muscles and mild nausea pass . Finished , she stepped to the sink and resoaked the towel . <p> Her hair was dark . She blinked and brown eyes stared back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . <p> She brought up the menu and opened the dialogue . <p> " Status ? " <p> Contract fulfilled satisfactorily . Overlay extracted , somatic regeneration initiated . <p> " I have n't completed transfer of bequests . " <p> Primary requirement fulfilled . Transfer of bequests a formality . <p> As she watched , a list of her compensations and options scrolled across her vision . In the night , the overlay had opted to terminate its presence . Imbedded nanoprocesses began reworking her , reverting hair color and texture , eye color , and skin . Over the next several days slight adjustments would reshape the underlying bone and redistribute fat deposits , giving her back her original face and body . Already , though , she looked very different from Ann Myref . <p> " I am Dadal Reos , " she said aloud , watching her reflection . It felt strange for a moment , then clicked into place . " I am Dadal Reos . " <p> She remembered enough of the overlay to complete the formal arrangements of the will . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler to wait till I left . " <p> Dadal sat on the bed for a time , letting her own memories and her own emotions sort themselves . Some of the odd moments of recognition she had experienced since grounding on Homestead made sense now - she had been born here , lived here till age six , when her family had moved to Sol System . The feeling of place had been strong enough to tease at the overlay and the client persona 's aversion to Seti jarred . <p> She dressed , grabbed the polycom , and went downstairs . She heard movement from the kitchen . Reluctant to confront Willem Karkaris , she stepped onto the porch . <p> Morning sun drove the shadows away from her . A heavy cloud loomed above the hill to the west . The air smelled faintly of rain . Nearby , a motile worked to dig up one of the multi-flue , blue - streaked Shimby Castles - that 's what they 're called ! - while pumping insecticide down the central shaft . A cloud of Shimbys floated around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann Myref . It would have been better to be well away from here , away from Homestead , before - <p> " Good morning , " Willem said from inside . " Hope you 're hungry . I prepared - " <p> She tensed and turned . he stood just inside , staring at her . She found that she no longer knew how to read him , but it seemed he was surprised and disappointed . <p> " The overlay shut down , Co Karkaris , " she said . <p> " Which means , I suppose , everything is done that she wanted doing . " <p> She said nothing . After a minute , he shrugged . <p> " Maybe she was right , " he said . he made a smile . " I still hope you 're hungry , Co ... ? " <p> " Dadal , " she said . " Dadal Reos . " <p> " Call me Will . " <p> She felt embarrassed and self - conscious through breakfast . Willem chatted about the winery and the different vintages he hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had lived near Ozma , several hundred kilometers from Fall 's End , in a more urban environment . Farming was something she knew little about . <p> " And it looks like the weather is changing , " he said as the motiles cleared away the dishes . " Only a few weeks late and none too soon . " <p> " Co Karkaris , I - " <p> " Will . Please . " <p> " I had no idea this would happen . It 's not standard procedure . Usually we leave - " <p> " It 's all right . " he smiled , but he looked sad . " Very Ann . Get in , do what needs doing , get out . " <p> " Well . But there are still details . " <p> " Of course . Show me . " <p> Dadal opened the polycom and accessed the bequests . Willem read the list . <p> " Damn , " he said . " You got it . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Oh , uh ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we started looking for a parcel on Earth , I found an old estate on the western coast of the North American continent .. . of course , it was far too expensive . But it was ideal . When I came to Homestead and bought this place , I picked it because it looked so much like it . It seems she finally got it . " <p> " And she left it to you . " <p> His breath shuddered . " Damn . " <p> After a long silence , Dadal indicated the screen . " Please touch the acceptance icon . " <p> He nodded and pressed a finger to the contact . The screen cleared and a moment later it showed TRANSFER COMPLETE . Dadal closed the unit down and stood . <p> " She must have kept her eye on that parcel all this time , " Willem said . " Property on Earth goes fast . Small window of opportunity . " <p> " You sound surprised . " <p> " I suppose I am . I guess .... " <p> " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pack and arrange transport - " <p> " Um . Do you have to leave today ? L ... " <p> Dadal watched him work through his feelings . Finally , he shrugged . <p> " I never found out much about you , " he said . " Yet I feel I 've known you .... " he grinned , telling her he was joking . <p> " I 've been doing this kind of work for five years , " she said . " Most of my own time , between commissions ... it 's not very interesting . " <p> " How do you know ? " <p> She looked out at the vineyards . Maybe she was finished , but this is n't done yet .... <p> Besides , she was not so sure she was ready to leave . She wondered - briefly - if this had been a factor in Ann Myref 's selecting her . <p> " You first . Would you like to tell me about her ? " she asked . " I have time . " She grunted .
