" Audiences do n't know somebody sits down and writes a picture , " says the cynical scenarist played by William Holden in Billy Wilder 's 1950 Sunset Blvd . " They think the actors make it up as they go along . " O.K. , most actors do n't write their own dialogue . But they are more than handsome lugs and ladies . They are the script 's words made flesh , the director 's dreams embodied . And for us people out there in the dark , actors are our best , our baddest , our deepest and most glamorous selves . <P> An actor does n't need to think up a picture . He can just take it over , make its personality his . Hustle &; Flow might sputter without the seductive screen intelligence of Terrence Howard . An actor can anchor a movie , as Maria Bello does in A History of Violence , or steal it , like Gong Li in Memoirs of a Geisha . <P> It 's great to see a lifetime of craft and care in Tommy Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kline , now 14 , the boldest understanding of a weird , endearing kid . <P> In an awards season that revs up next Monday with the Golden Globes and peaks on March 5 , Oscar night , some of the actors celebrated here will hear their names called ; some wo n't . We 're not giving out statuettes , just thank-you notes to seven people who wrote their artistry on the screen .
