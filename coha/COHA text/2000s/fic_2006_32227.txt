Rules for Old Men Waiting By Peter Pouncey Random House Peter Pouncey Rules to Stop the Rot The house and the old man were well matched , both large framed and failing fast . The house had a better excuse , MacIver thought ; he was eighty , but the house was older than the Republic , had been a century old when Thoreau walked the Cape , though he could n't have seen it tucked away in the nondescript maze of scrub oak . It had been the willful seclusion of the place that had appealed to them when they first saw itthat and the equally hidden pool , about two minutes away through their woods , which must have decided the builder to choose the site . The oaks grew more substantial as they approached the pond , but the casual visitor would not have registered their rising height as the ground fell away down to the water . But when the path did its last little jink through the thicket of spare mossy trunks and last year 's leaves , you stood on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred yards of water , more than fifty wide , a glade of water , fringed at both ends by sedge and reeds , shaded along the sides by the larger oaks . Bird-loud by day , redwings and warblers in and out of the reeds and busy water-traffic of ducks , and even , for a few seasons , the stately progressions of a pair of swans ; owls with their fluttery hoots at night , and very often at the far end beyond a fallen log , the hunched figure of a black-crowned night heron , the grim presiding judge executing sentence on a surprising number of small fish and frogs . Margaret and he had watched the pond over the years at every hour in every season . In summer , it was their swimming pool , where they swam naked at any time of day . Often on hot August nights , they would have a last dip before bed . They would take one towel between them , and no flashlight , because the night sky overhead was bright enough to light their way down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsy swimmer , would thrash the water into turbulence out into the deep and then make for shore , and try to use the towel as little as possible , to leave it dry for Margaret . She would go on a while longer , parting the water gently in her rhythmic breast-stroke , the moonlight playing on her wet hair with each forward surge , a sleek and quiet otter . He would lose her in the shadowed background at the far end , and peer with great concentration into the dark , to catch the first ripple of her return . When she finally waded towards the bank where he was standing , he would stay motionless trying to register the first moment when he could see into her silhouette , and detect the dark roundness of her nipples and the triangle of her pubic hair . Then she would let him dry her off , and they would go home to bed . In other seasons , dressed for the weather , they would take their station under one of the oaks , his back to the trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the life of the pool evolve around them . They had seen families of deer come down to drink , they had seen a raccoon balance on a log and try to fish with his paw , and one evening in the last of the light , they had seen a great horned owl sail out from the tree above them and swoop on a small rabbit on the other side of the pond . They had heard the short squeal , and seen the inert furry bundle dangling from the bird 's talons as he passed over them on his return . Many foxes , and once he would have sworn a bobcat , though it ca n't have been , padding along the far bank and back into the trees . You never knew what you would see . MacIver named the pond the Blind Pool , from a favorite boyhood story , though it was called Frog Pond on his geodetic map , and Margaret had called the house Night Heron House in honor of the constant sentinel standing by his fallen branch ; she did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the front door . It was a traditional Cape house , but on a larger scale than was usual , a bold architect 's airy enlargement . The front rooms were high ceilinged and framed with more massive beams , and instead of the usual chicken-run stairs inside the front door , there was a handsome Y-shaped staircase down a wide hall , breaking at a little landing halfway up and then splitting to left and right for the upper rooms . A Victorian owner had widened the two front windows and bowed them , letting in more light , and then had built a porch between the two bows , with central steps up to the front door and a simple railing on either side . The house stood by itself in a clearing , which you had to maintain vigilantly : half a summer , and the locust , oak , and birch sprigs would be crowding onto the grass . Original glass in many panes ; the shapes of things outside alternately clouded and cleared as your eyes moved across the windows . Original two-foot-wide floorboards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserving such width for the absent king . A cool , self-possessed house of mellow resonance , as if you were living inside a spacious cello . Nothing too decorative . They had three and a half decades to set their rhythms , coming and going to their secret fastness , the Night Heron House with its woods and pond . When Margaret fell ill and the doctors said they could do no more for her , they had moved to the Cape , as they had always planned in such a case , year-round ; in fact , she had three seasons left , fall to spring , 19861987 . At first the house had seemed to banish sickness . They had moved their bed into the living room , so she would not have to manage the stairs , but in the large , airy space she bustled light-footed as ever ; she set up her easel , and started a series of tree-scapes framed by the windows at different times of the day . The trees on the canvas got barer , MacIver noticed , as the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the angle of focus was raised to allow more cloud and sky , and at the end , in the unfinished ones , because the marks on the prepared white canvas , while precisely made , were fainter , less assertive : the effect left on her only viewer was of being pulled in her art past the blank of whiteness to the vanishing point of thin air . As winter approached , they would still visit the pond on good days , though they did n't stay long to absorb its more furtive movement ; they would come out at the end of the path and stand a few moments looking , an old couple supporting each other in a lover 's stance , heads inclined towards each other , his rangy arm around her frail shoulders , her mittened hand around his waist . Then they would work their way back ; she only needed a sighting , it seemed . Things were moving faster for them now , forcing changes they could not plan . In no time the number of hours she could be up each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shortening on them . By the end of February , she was confined to bed , daily falling further away from him deeper into sickness . He was ill himself , he knew , but nothing to this . First weekly , then twice a week , he would make grim sallies to the drugstore for the morphine prescribed from New York , and come back as fast as he dared , fearful of finding another visible weakening . There was no talk of going somewhere else for final care . It would end here , in this room . He would read to her , coax her to eat a little , play Mozart to her , spin new tales she would like about his boyhood on Loch Affric , and games and battles farther afield . When she drowsed , he would stay sitting on in the bentwood rocker through the fading afternoon . She would wake up and read his unguarded face ; she could see her fierce old Scot being gentled out of character by his own secret illness , never to be mentioned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was not a man who had ever willingly let things be taken out of his hands . Sometimes she would send him on small missions , to shake him out of his spellbound broodings . She would ask him to go down to the pond , and report back on your findings . At first in the winter , he would have to work hard for interesting gleanings to take back to heranimal tracks on the frozen pond , an air bubble caught in the creamy ice inshore around the heron 's branch , the number of trees deep he could count in the leafless screen of woods across the pond , viewed from the oak where they hung the towel . When the grudging days of early spring arrived , and the trees were fretted more with undergrowth , the views foreshortened , but there was more to report . One day in late April , he had taken her back a box turtle , patterned in a smart brown and yellow plaid , but built a little too high off the ground , like the old Volkswagen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the quilt , and the little fellow had finally stuck his head out of his shell and taken a couple of steps , before pooping quite impressively right there on the bed . Margaret had given him the Scottish name of Archibald , and insisted that MacIver take him back to exactly the same leaves in which he had found him , with the added gift of a lettuce leaf for his pains . She died three days after that , on the first soft day that promised full-blooded spring . As Margaret had feared would be the case , MacIver did not do well after she had gone . He let himself go , and he let the house go . He knew it was happening and he felt bad about it as far as the house was concerned , but he did n't seem able to do much about it , except fitfully . His concentration was gone , along with the object of his attention . There was a backlog of work due on the house ; they had loved it and cared for it year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall MacIver had persuaded Margaret against all previous habits to delay some of the chores to the spring ; they should hunker down and enjoy each other quietly , without ladders looming and workers banging . She had been sick enough to agree , but the house was showing its frailty now quite markedly ; it was no longer a matter of cleaning gutters , checking storm windows , and calling the exterminator to keep the termites at bay . The fabric of the house was sagging visibly on the eastern side , and he was sure it needed a new roof . And what else ? He mentally checked off the items he knew aboutsiding on the windward face of the house , boiler , always feeble , cheating him of more and more degrees against the thermostat ( unless it was the cold , or the windows ? ) , two sagging , buckled gutters . In the end , he did not call the contractors , because he did not want them to open up the house and tell him how bad it was . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want their banging , their company , or even their secret sympathy . Bereavement seemed to work on him as a kind of blanket allergy , making him edgy and irritable to all the outside world . And of course it was reciprocal : the world receded on him . Even his own Blind Pool seemed to shun him as an interloper . The lens of the water , which had taken in a full orbit of creatures and their activities , their presence and their shadows , and held them for key moments for the two of them to share and admire , now stared blankly upwards , blind indeed . He could tell that his ability to focus , to fix on a detail and hold it , had deserted him , and the loss of it had weakened his grasp on the place . He did not really seem able to see what was happening anymore .
