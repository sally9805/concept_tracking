Chapter One VICKI Byrne lunged for the crib and swung a board at the hovering locust . She missed , but the beast veered away , screaming , " Apollyon ! " " More are trying to get in ! " Darrion yelled . " Stay there , " Vicki said . " I 'll get this one ! " The locust dove at the baby again . Vicki 's stomach turned at the hideous face of the creature . She swung again and connected . The locust bounced off the wall and fell into the crib . " Do n't let it hurt my baby ! " Lenore yelled from above . " Shut the door ! " Vicki said , peeking over the edge of the crib . The baby cried and kicked at his cover as the locust lay a few inches from his feet . " It 's OK , Tolan , " Vicki said . " I 'm going to get this bad thing away from you . " Tolan smiled . Vicki picked up the locust by one of its legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miniature horse armed for war , but where a mane should have been was long , flowing hair . On its back were wings . Vicki flipped the locust over and saw a human face , but the front teeth were like a lion 's . Lenore trembled . " Do n't let it hurt my baby . " " Keep the door closed , " Vicki said through clenched teeth . " If this thing gets upstairs it 'll sting all of you . " " Put it under the door before it comes to , " Shelly said . Vicki dropped the locust , and Shelly kicked it against the wooden door , then mashed its body into the mud . " Another one 's getting in ! " Darrion shouted . Before Vicki could react , a locust skittered by and flew toward the crib . Its wings twitched furiously with a metallic clicking as it rose toward Tolan . The child reached for it and laughed . " Apollyon , " the locust wailed . Vicki raced for the crib , but the locust disappeared over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child 's face , its teeth bared . But it stopped each time , unable to get closer than a few inches from Tolan . The locust darted up , turned to attack , but stopped in midair . Venom sloshed in its tail as it screamed in its high-pitched voice , " Apollyon ! " Tolan stared at the locust , then looked at Vicki . Lenore shrieked , eyeing the door above . " Do n't let it get my baby ! " Vicki swung at the locust , but the beast darted behind the crib . " Get back upstairs , Lenore ! " Vicki said . " We 're not letting her back up here ! " Melinda shouted . " She wo n't keep the door closed . " Shelly and Darrion tromped on the floor to keep other locusts out . Vicki helped Lenore up , but the woman fell back , horror on her face . Vicki turned and saw the locust , its mouth dripping with venom , heading straight for them . * * * Judd Thompson Jr . was somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane sat on the runway in Jerusalem , trapped by thousands of swarming demons . The pilot scowled at Judd . " Why are n't you afraid ? " " They wo n't attack a believer in Christ , " Judd said . " You 're crazy . " " I am not , " Judd said . " Let me help . " " I ca n't let you go out there . " Judd put a hand on the pilot 's arm . " Anyone else goes out , they 'll get stung . Open the door and those things will swarm in . If I can get the gate attached , there 's a chance these people can get inside the terminal . " The pilot looked out and studied the locusts . " This section of the terminal is isolated . " " Please , " Judd said . The pilot turned to the flight attendant . " Get the crash ax . We 'll cut a hole in the baggage compartment . " " Wait , " Judd said . " Those things will get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A high-pitched sound followed . " Abbadon ! " a locust proclaimed . " How are they getting in ? " the flight attendant said . The pilot picked up a phone . " Jim , close the manual override to the outflow valve . Now ! " Judd heard locusts scampering overhead . " How thick is that tubing ? " " It 's plastic and thick enough , " the pilot said . " They ca n't chew through . " He clicked on the intercom . " Ladies and gentlemen , please be seated . There 's no way the bugs can get into the cabin . Please stay calm as we work on getting you out of here safely . A young man has offered to help , so clear the aisles and stay in your seats . " Applause greeted Judd as he stepped into the aisle and followed the pilot . The man lifted the edge of the carpet and pulled a yellow tab . The carpet tore along a seam , revealing a small door . " This leads to a compartment under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the floor . " It 's tight , but you 'll fit . " " The locusts will come in when you open it , " Judd said . The pilot twisted the ring and turned a bolt on the hatch door . " Not if you do it right . It 's an access bay . You get inside and we seal the top . Open another door at the bottom and you 're outside . No way they can get in . " The pilot showed Judd how to move the jetway into position once he was outside the plane , then opened the hatch . " I hope you 're right about them not attacking you . " Judd wriggled to the bottom and found a latch with a weird handle and a button . He pressed and turned it , bracing himself as the hatch opened . Locusts flew into the hole , but Judd kicked at them . Finally , he let go and dropped to the ground . Judd felt both relief and horror . The fresh air felt good , but the locusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horrid creatures scratching and biting at the fuselage . Some hovered near the windows , shrieking as they tried to get at the passengers . White fluid dripped from a burned-out engine . Somehow , the locusts had shattered a rotor and had flown right through the engine . If those locusts had survived , there was no way to kill the beasts . * * * Lionel Washington stood at a window in the terminal . He had lived through an earthquake and the other judgments sent by God , but nothing compared to this . Sam Goldberg stood beside him , looking equally shocked . Lionel , Sam , and Judd had planned to return to Illinois , but now the world had turned upside down . " My father , " Sam said . " What happens when he is stung ? " Lionel pointed to an airline worker writhing in pain on the runway . " He 'll hurt so bad he 'll want to kill himself . But he wo n't be able to . " Sam groaned . " If only he 'd listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beat on the glass doors . A security guard ran toward her . " You ca n't go through there , ma'am ! It 's for your own safety . " " My daughter 's in there ! " Lionel saw locusts were on the other side of the glass swooping and attacking as people ran from side to side . Some people cowered in corners . A few tried to hide near pay phones . Others ran for rest rooms and locked themselves inside . Lionel felt helpless . The only hope for these people was the truth , but they were too frightened to listen . Sam tugged on Lionel 's arm and pointed toward the runway . " Look at that ! " Lionel gasped when Judd crawled out from under the plane and moved toward the terminal . He disappeared beneath the jetway in a swirl of angry locusts . " We have to help ! " Lionel said . * * * Mark was elated that his new friend , Carl Meninger , had believed the message and was now a follower of Christ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mark fired up the motorcycle and the two rode away . He slowed to a crawl because of all the locusts buzzing around them . " We get hit with one of those and we 're dead . " After a few miles Mark pulled to the side of the road . " I ca n't drive in this . We 'll have to wait until they thin out . " He pushed the motorcycle through a grove of trees and into a clearing . The locusts buzzed through the trees looking for more victims . Mark found a spot in the shade and took out food and drinks from his knapsack . " You saved my life , " Carl said . " That 's twice somebody from your family has done that . " Mark smiled . " Getting stung hurts , but you would n't have died . " Carl took a drink and sat back against the tree . " I have a confession . I said I wanted to meet because of your cousin John . But that 's only one reason I came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the second . " * * * Vicki had dropped her wood plank when she helped Lenore up . Now , with a locust bearing down on them , she swung and smacked it with her hand . Vicki recoiled in pain , like she had hit a metal baseball . Her hand throbbed and swelled . The locust hurtled backward and hit the wall . It shook its head , sputtered , then resumed the attack . " Another one 's getting through ! " Darrion yelled . Tolan sat up in his crib and cried for his mother . Vicki joined hands with Shelly and Darrion and they surrounded Lenore , huddling close as three locusts circled menacingly . " Pray ! " Vicki said . " Hurry ! " " God , protect Tolan 's mom from these things . Do n't let her get stung . " A locust swooped in , brushing Vicki 's hair . " In the name of Jesus , " Vicki said , " keep them away . God , protect her like you protected your friends in the boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls moved closer together , arms linked , heads touching as they stood against the locusts . " Jesus is King and Lord , " Darrion shouted . " Apollyon ! " the demons called out . " Jesus ! " Darrion screamed back . " Jesus is the Christ , the Messiah , the Lamb of God ! Get out of here ! " Two locusts hovered over Tolan 's crib but moved no closer to him . They clicked their wings and joined the other in midair . " Let 's face them , " Vicki said , arms still clasped with Shelly and Darrion . The hovering locusts looked straight at Vicki . She summoned her courage and looked into their ugly faces , tongues sticking out of gnashing teeth . " Leave this woman and her baby alone , " Vicki said , her teeth clenched . " In the name of Jesus , I command you ! " Over and over the locusts repeated the name of the chief demon , " Apollyon ! " " Jesus has authority ! " Shelly said . " Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locusts seemed to look at each other while Lenore whimpered , her hands covering her head . Suddenly , Charlie opened the door above and peeked into the room . Vicki yelled , but before the boy could close the door , the three locusts darted up and through the crack . Melinda and Charlie screamed . Vicki locked the door from the inside . Darrion snatched Tolan from the crib and brought him to Lenore . The woman grabbed for him , and he hugged her neck tight . " I 've never seen anything like that , " Lenore said . " They were awful . " " And more are trying to get in , " Shelly said . Panting , Lenore scanned the room . " Settle down , " Vicki said , kneeling before her . " This ought to show you what we 're saying is true . " Lenore tried to catch her breath . " I know ... you kids are religious ... but I do n't know what to do .... " " Jesus is God , " Vicki said , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know him ? " Lenore nodded . " Tell him . " Lenore trembled and bowed her head , her face in her hands . " God , I need you . I know I 've done bad things and I 'm sorry . Forgive me . I know you 're real , and you mean what you say in the Bible . I believe you died for me and that you 're coming back after all this is over . So come into my life and make me a new person . " Shelly and Darrion knelt beside Vicki and the woman . When Lenore took her hands away from her face , Vicki saw , forming on Lenore 's forehead , the mark of the believer .
