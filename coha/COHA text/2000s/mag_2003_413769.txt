I hope you all die on the breeding grounds next year ! I hope they napalm your tail feathers ! You 're worthless ! I hate you ! " Another delta goose hunt had come to an end . You 've seen the photos of goose hunts , of camo-draped hunters standing neatly in dry pit blinds as huge birds float like blimps toward their waiting shotguns . You 've read the stories of sportsmen walking through frost-covered wheat stubble , lugging the day 's haul of honkers . You 've seen the videos portraying the sport as the ultimate in waterfowling  --  a no-muss , no-fuss gentleman 's game . Well , forget it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for goose hunters in her southeastern marshes , it 's a voluntary hell on earth whose victims seem condemned to an eternity of frustration and bedevilment . Frustration because after long , dangerous boat rides and slogging through thick gumbo mud , they seldom get a shot , much less bag a goose . Bedevilment because they keep coming back for more . At first glance the suffering appears surprising . Upward of 60,000 snow geese descend on the vast Mississippi Delta each fall , providing what would seem to be ample , and large , targets for hunters . Besides , for waterfowlers who think the game is too difficult , there are certainly options  --  like the 300,000 ducks often swarming in the same skies . But looks are deceiving . These are n't just any birds . And these are definitely not normal hunters . EINSTEINS OF WATERFOWL The snow goose , in fact , is among the most remarkable of modern wildlife stories , a critter that has defied the odds by not only surviving man 's hungry consumption of planet Earth , but benefiting from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfowl species in the last 50 years provided snow geese with rich wintering grounds . That has resulted in record numbers with unexpected results : The expanding population is destroying the fragile tundra along the edges of Canada 's Hudson Bay . Waterfowl managers have responded by steadily raising limits and even offering no-limit hunting . But the snows are definitely not birdbrains . They 're hard as the devil to hunt . " They are n't easy to decoy , because they usually stay in huge flocks and do n't break up into small groups , " says veteran guide Mike Smith , of Reggio , La . " And even when they do break up , they 're just very wary and spooky . " They leave their breeding grounds that way , and by the time they reach their wintering grounds along the Gulf Coast they are the Einsteins of the waterfowling world . The bird has a better reputation in southwestern Louisiana , where the playing field is more even , and civil . There , snow geese by the tens of thousands mass on wheat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's great prairie . And sports can hunt in the comfort of large , clean , dry pit blinds . Things are n't that easy on the delta . The Mississippi River delta is heaven for waterfowl , a sprawling wetland complex of fresh and brackish marshes , lagoons , bays and mud flats . But that maze of habitat means the geese have many options  --  too many , in fact . They move daily , and often to vast mud flats , forcing hunters to work like marathon runners . BIRDS ON THE HORIZON Robert " Boozie " Cosse and his pals , brothers Brent and Brandon Ballay , are all in their mid-20s . Despite their age , they should know better : They grew up on the delta and have chased geese there for 15 years . Yet they are going back  --  for the second time in a week . " We got two yesterday , " says Brent as we load more than a hundred decoys onto an 18-foot flat for the ride downriver . " It 's the challenge we like . Anyone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the goose hunting . " Around 1 p.m. , Cosse points the rig down the Mississippi into the teeth of a 15-knot wind growling up the channel of the big river . Seventy wet minutes later , he is in the relative quiet of South Pass on a portion of the state-run Pass-a-Loutre Wildlife Management Area and beaches the boat on a point of deltaic muck filled with winter-burned , three-corner grass . We set the decoys by slogging through 2 feet of soft delta mud , raining sweat in the 70-degree afternoon . When the job is done we walk upwind about 50 yards , hiding in the grass or behind a large " floater , " a tree trunk left by the river during high water . The wait has hardly started when the frustration hits home : A third of a mile away large clouds of geese can be seen rising , setting down , rising again . They 're on the point Brent and Boozie hunted the day before . " Looks like we guessed wrong , " says Brent . " But it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've still got two hours to wait . " We discuss the pros and cons of snow goose hunting on the delta . Brandon Ballay shares a thought . " You ca n't give up , but sometimes it seems pretty hopeless . " BRUISED EGOS Hopeless did n't arrive until near sundown . The few geese that strayed over our spot remained aloof and aloft  --  honking and yelping from several hundred yards up , far out of range . And now a large group is rising in a thick cloud across the bay , taunting us . " Must be twenty thousand over there , " yells Brent . " You see , this is why I hate goose hunting down here . You come all this way , work this hard , and you may never get a shot . " But Brandon has been working his goose call and he gives an urgent warning : " Two coming in to your left . " Sure enough , two stray snow geese are working toward the spread from 100 yards away  --  and not too high . Oddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're coming right in , " whispers Brent . And they do , floating within 70 yards , then 60 , 50 , 30 ... Then one of the geese lets out a high-pitched yelp , and the pair suddenly gains altitude . Brent rises and unloads three shells from his 12-gauge . Brandon and Boozie follow suit . But the geese turn harmlessly in the sky  --  chased by epithets from the hunters . The final indignity still lay ahead . As we slog through the muck to collect the dekes , the honking of geese grows from a distant echo to a roar . Suddenly the shadows of a dozen snows come zooming within 3 feet of our heads . " We 're stupid , really stupid to do this , " Brent says . " But we 'll probably do it again tomorrow .
