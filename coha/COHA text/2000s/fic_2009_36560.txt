One <p> I lie in bed watching the numbers on the digital alarm click in slow motion to 6:00 a.m. , 6:01 . My right hand , curled tightly beneath my head , is cramping , but I do n't want to risk moving it . I lie perfectly still , listening to the birds chirping noisily outside , a high-pitched chorus wafting rebelliously through the harsh geometry of Manhattan . Nervous I would oversleep , I had tossed fitfully until dawn . Now , as with most missed opportunities , the only thing I long for is another chance at the night . <p> The lightness of the chirping fills me with a yearning I ca n't quite place , for unabridged land , for air , for my own childhood forty miles north of here , though I wanted desperately to escape the precisely gridded suburbs with their overriding promise of safety . Still , it 's hard not to feel nostalgia for a time when I thought predictability was the worst fate imaginable . <p> I shut my eyes , willing the thought away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <p> Sam grunts softly in his sleep and rearranges his long legs , his left thigh brushing against mine under the sheets . I flinch unconsciously at the brief interlude of skin on skin and hold my breath , trying not to disturb him  --  he has been up most of the night . He settles into his new position , letting out an aborted sigh from somewhere deep within his dream , and I exhale , secretly disappointed that he has n't woken , turned to me . I look down , studying his face in the pale sunlight . Always handsome , he is more defined now , his edges sharper , as if everything soft and extraneous has been carved away , leaving his most essential self exposed . I run my fingertips gently through his matted dark-blond hair  --  I 've always loved him best this way , disheveled , unguarded . <p> His skin is warm , almost moist . <p> I try to remember the last time we made love in this fragile sliver of time before the girls wake up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach over and shut off the alarm so it wo n't wake him . All through the night I felt his agitation roiling his attempts at sleep , infiltrating my own . I 'd turned to him once around two a.m. and asked what was bothering him . <p> " Nothing , just the story I 'm working on . The pieces do n't jibe , a source wo n't call me back , " he said , curving away from me , though whether it was to avoid disturbing me further or a desire to be left alone , I was n't sure . I 've seen him like this many times before at the beginning of an assignment , waiting for a clear narrative to form in his head . He is a man who likes order and grows steeped in anxiety until he can impose it . Perhaps that 's all it is . <p> For months , though , all through the summer , Sam has seemed restive for reasons I ca n't quite place . It has grown contagious , a malaise that has metastasized between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch , nothing worthy of accusation or argument , and yet . I hope the cooler season will wipe the slate clean , bring a new semester for our marriage . <p> I miss him . <p> There are moments , unexpected , unpredictable , when there is a sudden flash , a brief illumination in a look or touch , and we are us again , connected . They are hard to manufacture , though , no matter how hard I try . Sometimes I can feel him trying , too , missing me , too . <p> I slide carefully out of bed and pad barefoot down the hallway , bending over to pick up a crumpled gum wrapper , poorly hidden evidence of Claire 's latest habit , the cloying sweet smell of imitation strawberry , grape , watermelon , vanilla emanating from her like cheap perfume , the noisy snapping and chewing deeply annoying , even more so because it is surely interfering with the six thousand dollars ' worth of braces that encase her teeth , correcting a supposed crookedness that only an Upper East Side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've taken to hiding my own gum-chewing habit , one of the pretenses I 've recently felt it necessary to assume . I open the front door carefully , hoping its creak wo n't wake the children , take the papers into the kitchen and make a pot of coffee . <p> I can feel their breath , Sam 's , the girls ' , in their separate corners of the apartment , surrounding me , grounding me even as they sleep . I have twenty minutes before I have to wake them and make breakfast , which , as per first day of school tradition , will involve pots and pans rarely seen on weekday mornings , scrambled eggs with chives snipped from the shriveling strands of the window herb plant , toast slathered with strawberry rhubarb preserves from the farmers ' market , hot chocolate made from unsweetened cocoa and sugar rather than packets , ballast for whatever schoolyard intrigues , new teachers ' quirks , algebraic conundrums , vertiginous swings in popularity lie ahead . I turn on the radio and listen to the weather report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening to hit the high eighties . <p> I dip my finger in the jam and lick it absentmindedly . Long ago , when the girls were still young enough to need supervision at the breakfast table , Sam and I developed a tag-team approach . I would get them up , put the food on the table and then dress while he ate with them . Though Phoebe is eleven and Claire thirteen , the habit remains , one of the unexamined rituals of family life that you realize only later are its very glue . <p> I take one last sip of coffee and walk into Phoebe 's room first , stepping carefully over the huge shopping bag of new school supplies from Staples that have spilled across the floor , a kaleidoscope of colorful binders , highlighters in seven colors , six of which are totally unnecessary as far as I 'm concerned , a new hole punch , index cards for book reports , neon-pink Post-its in the shape of hearts and arrows . Phoebe possesses a unique blend of laserlike focus and forgetfulness  --  she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bus . It is one of the things  --  not just the forgetfulness , but her lack of concern about it  --  that she has promised , albeit halfheartedly , to work on this year , though when I suggested buying a memo pad for to-do lists , she refused . " I 'm eleven , " she reminded me indignantly , as if lists were one more odious thing waiting for her in adulthood , along with mortgages , insurance claims , cholesterol readings . " Writing things on the back of my hand works just fine . " <p> I lean over to kiss her cheek and she rolls sleepily into me , burying her face in the crook of my neck , her eyes fluttering open and then closing again . <p> " You have to get up , sweetie , " I whisper as I run my fingers underthe blanket and tickle her , her body at least nominally still mine . Thesoftness of her neck , her arms makes the walls of my heart constrict.No one really tells you how much it is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be . Or that you willnever feel completely safe and relaxed again . <p> " Not yet . " Her breath is heated , musty but sweet . <p> Since they got home from camp , the girls have grown used to lounging in bed till noon , especially in the last few weeks , when , like a final indulgent binge before a diet , we all lost the will for discipline of any sort . <p> " I hate school , " Phoebe groans . <p> " It 's too soon to hate school . " <p> " It 's never too soon to hate school . " <p> I smile , knowing the words are hollow . Phoebe is by nature an easygoing child who , despite her carelessness , is generally anxious to please her teachers and popular with her friends . " Get up , my little misanthrope . " <p> She looks at me suspiciously and is about to ask what the word means when she thinks better of it , knowing I will tell her to look it up , something she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too soon for me to get a cell phone , either , " she calls after me . <p> I leave without answering . I have decreed , repeatedly , that twelve is the age of consent for that particular piece of technology , my desire for being in constant touch , for being able to place her , outweighed by my certainty that Phoebe will lose at least a dozen phones within the first month . I make my way to Claire 's room , where every available surface is lined with ornate boxes , jewelry cases , embroidered journals , the artifacts of her life stashed in tiny drawers , a Chinese puzzle of secrets and mementos . There is no one on earth quite as sentimental as a thirteen-year-old girl . In the rare moments when I am alone in the house I sometimes go through her drawers , scan her Internet history , her notebooks , looking not for evidence of crimes but for clues to who she is becoming . When I lean down to wake her , Claire shrugs away , curling deeper beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It takes three increasingly strenuous shakes to get her to at least raise her head temporarily , her face hidden by a tangle of thick brunette hair almost the exact color as mine . If Phoebe is Sam 's daughter , lighter in coloring and temperament , Claire , with her olive skin , her broodier nature , is mine . Claire 's chosen outfit for the day  --  a loosely knit pale-pink cable sweater , denim mini and leggings  --  is carefully laid out on her desk chair . She spent a few days last week in East Hampton with a school friend shunning the beach to shop on Main Street and Newtown Lane , Claire suddenly one of those tanned , long-legged girls of indeterminate age still so alien to me with their giddy sense of entitlement apparent in every avid stride . I wonder if strangers , seeing Claire , assumed she was one of them , with an enormous shingled house and a credit card of her own . <p> " Honey , I think you may need to rethink your outfit , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . " <p> Claire shakes her head at the ridiculousness of the notion . The outfit ca n't be rethought  --  the skirt is too short for the school 's restriction that hems be within four inches of the knee to wear without leggings and the sweater is , well , perfect . Any dolt can see that . <p> " I 'll be fine , " Claire insists . Under the best of circumstances , she has a certain rigidity that , though frustrating at times , I nevertheless hope will serve her well later in life when self-doubt , frankly self-reflection of any kind , has a tendency to impede progress , if not happiness . I have come to see the benefits of having blinders on . Anyway , when it comes to clothes Claire is particularly ironclad . It 's useless to fight , though that does n't always stop me from trying . It 's a hard habit to break  --  thinking you can control your own children . <p> The girls are dressed , Phoebe in capris and an Urban Outfitters T-shirt she pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in precisely the outfit she had planned , and at the table , pushing their eggs around with the tines of their forks when Sam stumbles out . He looks momentarily surprised at the presence of actual cooked food before recognition dawns on him . " Ah , " he says , smiling , " the first day . The anticipation , the dread , the scramble for good seats . " He bends over and kisses the top of the girls ' heads . He has an informal , easygoing manner with the kids , who accept the undertone of irony as part of his makeup , like one 's particular scent or way of walking . It is the same relaxed , loping charm I fell in love with nineteen years ago when we sat next to each other in the back row of a class on Hawthorne and James during our junior year in college : the smile that even then creased the sides of his cheeks , the tatty burgundy wool scarf draped casually around his neck in a way that only prep-school boys can ever truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his baritone that entered my pores and stayed there like smoke . Sam seemed to have an innate sense of belonging and yet not take it seriously  --  a lethal combination to someone like me . My own family had struggled into the middle class , there was nothing effortless about it , every move , every emotion was splayed out , picked over , vociferously debated . The very notion of privacy was alien , suspect . Sam 's cool distance was as deeply attractive to me as my lack of it was to him . Then , anyway . <p> I watch Sam , yawning as he takes his first sip of coffee , breaks offa piece of Claire 's toast and gets his hand slapped , a shopworn routinethat nevertheless tangles me up with comfort and affection . <p> This is what we have created , this family . <p> Sam flips through the stack of newspapers in front of him , quickly scanning the front pages of The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post before turning to the business sections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a juicy story he has somehow missed ?  --  and poorly concealed relief that there is only the usual stock market pabulum and speculative opinion . An observer by nature , he has a talent for intuiting shifts in mood and influence , the way power movesaround the city . It 's what makes him a good business journalist . Still , two weeks ago , Sam 's latest competitor at the magazine , Peter Borofsky , a reporter six years younger and ten times as hungry , broke a story about how the board of a Fortune 500 company spied on its own president , bugging his phone , getting his financial records . The report made it onto the evening news and Sam ca n't help but grit his teeth every time he hears it mentioned . This morning , at least , he is safe . So far . I know that the moment I leave he will race to his laptop to check an ever-expanding list of Web sites and blogs . There are so many more ways to be bested now . <p> " What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancing up from the paper . <p> " Some forms to fill out at school ... " <p> " What forms ? " Claire demands , suspicious . <p> " Nothing , just the class trip consent things . " <p> " Did n't you do that ? They were due weeks ago . " <p> " I thought I had , but apparently not . I got an e-mail from the school on Friday . " <p> Claire looks at me disdainfully . <p> I shrug . There are so many forms , a new batch every day , and newsletters and invitations and updates and e-mails , as if the school is worried parents wo n't feel they are getting their money 's worth if their mailboxes are n't constantly overflowing . " It 'll be fine , " I insist . I turn back to Sam . " Then I 'm having breakfast with Deirdre . " <p> Sam nods and as he flips the page of his newspaper the corner dips into his coffee and threatens to fall off into soggy little islands of print . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus so snowy that ropes stretched like cat 's cradle yarn across it for students to pull their way to classes . In recent years , though , my friendship with Deirdre has come to exist largely outside of a broader social context , a skein that binds us from our early days in Manhattan , when we shared a loft in the East Village . For fifteen years we have been meeting once a week , or close to it , though what had oncebeen late-night drinks in cheap dive bars has morphed into early-morning breakfasts . " This is the most long-term relationship I 've ever had , " Deirdre often jokes . I have Sam , of course , but I know just what she means . <p> " You 'll see her at Jack 's dinner tomorrow night , " I remind him . <p> " How could I forget ? The big birthday celebration . " <p> " Who 's Jack ? " Claire asks . <p> " Someone we went to college with . " <p> " How come I 've never met him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; neither of the girls truly believe in its existence . <p> " He lives in Boston . " <p> " You 're going to Boston ? " Phoebe asks , perplexed . <p> " No . He has a job interview in New York and asked us all out to dinner , " I explain . " We have n't seen each other in years . " <p> Jack Handel was Deirdre 's college boyfriend , a scholarship kid from northern California . From the start , he and I shared a special empathy ; we were both outsiders on that hilly , privileged campus , though our reactions were quite different . If I wanted  --  a little too desperately  --  to fit in , Jack wore his interloper status defiantly . It 's not that he had a chip on his shoulder , but his sense of direction set him apart ; he was sharper , faster , more strategic , while the rest of us were still a little soft , unformed , blurry around the edges . I still remember one Christmas vacation , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . For Deirdre and Sam , who both grew up here , Manhattan was already a checkerboard of memories : There was Trader Vic 's at the Plaza , where Deirdre swore they let her drink at sixteen  --  we got plastered on Scorpions , with their sickeningly sweet floating gardenias and two-foot-long straws , Deirdre and I in our thrift-shop fifties cocktail dresses wobbling out into the cold night ; we went to Sam 's favorite jazz club downtown and were scolded for talking during the sets ; we ended up at three a.m. at Brasserie , where Deirdre 's father had a running tab and we could charge enormous breakfasts , though I asked repeatedly to the point of annoyance if she was sure it was okay . I was barely able to afford a diner on my own and could n't imagine anyone being that cavalier about money . And there were the places that they avoided . Deirdre would n't go to Serendipity because it was where her father used to take her to drown her parents ' divorce in Frozen Hot Chocolates ; she centered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written off all of Park Avenue on principle . The city was a game of Twister to them , and if I would never catch up I would also never risk falling into one of their valleys . That winter break , though , Jack and I were along for the ride , giddy , exuberant , lucky to be chosen . For that brief moment , opportunity , the future itself , felt boundless . <p> We thought it would always be that way . <p> Sam turns another page of his newspaper . " Who is Jack interviewing with ? " <p> " He would n't tell me . He signed a confidentiality agreement . " <p> " I ca n't see him moving to New York . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " It 's easier to be a big deal in Boston . Is Alice coming ? " <p> " I do n't think so . He 'll only be here overnight . His actual birthday is next weekend , so I guess they 'll do their own thing up there . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deirdre 's birthday is in seven weeks , Sam has six more months , I have eight . <p> " You 'd think Deirdre would be the last person he 'd want to spend his birthday with . " <p> " It was all so long ago , " I remind him . <p> Claire listens intently . She worships Deirdre , scavenging for clues to a life so much more captivating than anything we could possibly offer . <p> Sam shrugs without looking up and runs his hands lazily down his flat stomach  --  he still runs three miles most mornings , though his knees have lately begun creaking with alarming regularity . At thirty-nine he considers this a decidedly premature development that he plans on ignoring for as long as possible . Like most men he is determined to deny the physical signs of aging to the same degree that women obsess about them . " By the way , I may be late tonight . " <p> " Late as in do n't hold dinner ? " For years , Sam and I ate after the girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be hooked on heroin by the age of fourteen if we do n't change our evil ways . Lately I 've been making a concerted , if erratic , effort for all of us to eat approximately the same thing at approximately the same time . There have been spurts of upstart rebellions from various involved parties ever since . <p> " I 'm not sure . I 'll call you as soon as I know . I 'm hoping to meet with someone about the Wells profile . I 'm waiting to hear back from him . " <p> I study Sam , weighing my options . It would never occur to me that being late on the first night of school is even a choice . Still , I do n't want to fight this morning . And I know how much he needs this profile . <p> Sam has recently been assigned to write a cover story on Eliot Wells , the founder of Leximark . An early innovator in Web functionality , he is supposedly about to introduce some breakthrough cross-platform first-step artificial intelligence something or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pretend I do rather than suffer through one more excruciating explanation . All I know is that the most controversial thing that has been written about Wells in recent years , aside from allusions to his cataclysmic temper , is that he has a proclivity to skip showers  --  though it seems to me this is said about any number of Internet gurus , as if a lack of personal hygiene is in and of itself a sign of genius . Sam is hoping to uncover something grittier and has convinced himself  --  though not , as yet , his editor , Simon  --  that there is dirt lurking in Wells 's background . Of course , the great inverse law of journalism is that the further you bring someone down , the higher you raise your own profile . <p> " All right , let me know . " I get up to dress . <p> " Lisa ? " <p> I turn partially around . " Yes ? " <p> " There 's something I want to talk to you about . " His face , still hatch-marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous . <p> I look at him quizzically . <p> He glances over at the girls . " Later . Tonight . " <p> " All right . " <p> As I pass , he reaches over and grazes my forearm with his fingertips . <p> I will feel it there for the rest of the day , he can still do that to me . <p> I leave the three of them in the kitchen and go to shower , letting the hot water pour down my face , thinking of the day ahead , what to wear , my schedule at work , wondering , too , what Sam might want to talk to me about and why he thinks he needs to reserve my time . I mean , where else would I be ? <p> When I get out I notice that his cell phone , charging on the night table , is flashing with a message . <p> I wrap the towel tighter about my chest , shake out my shoulder-length hair , the thick , dark waves not yet expanding from the heat into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer . I open the top drawer of my dresser , consider three different versions of a white V-neck top that to the naked eye look identical but which are in fact each completely necessary for varying levels of bloat . I can hear Sam and the girls clearing their plates . I glance at the door , still closed . <p> I do n't know why I pick up the phone . I have never done anything like this before . It would be easy to say it is intuition , but we always claim that in retrospect . <p> With it still charging , I push " voice mail " and listen to his message . <p> It is a woman 's voice , she does not leave a name , she does not have to , judging by the intimacy lacing through her tone . " I 'm going to be a little late tonight , " she says , the words slightly muffled by the whoosh of traffic in the background . " Can we make it six thirty ? Same place . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down on the edge of the bed , a cool sweat beading along the back of my neck and trickling slowly down my spine . <p> Copyright 2009 by Emily Listfield <br> Continues ...
