WHY CA N'T I OUTRUN AN AVALANCHE ? Avalanches play dirty , my friend , and they deserve all the explosives we can hurl at them . A typical slab slide can reach 20 miles per hour within three seconds of breaking loose from a slope . Three seconds after that , it can hit 80 miles per hour  --  a lot faster than most people can ski . According to Bruce Tremper , author of Staying Alive in Avalanche Terrain , " You 'll need to be mighty cagey to get out of the way . People have been known to scoot off to the side in time , but to outrun one , you need to be a world-champion downhill racer . " Which is n't to say Bode Miller can safely cavort in avalanche terrain , either . As Tony Daffern , author of Avalanche Safety for Skiers and Climbers , explains : " The problem with slab avalanches is that as soon as the snow breaks up and loses its internal cohesion , your skis sink deeper . " Meaning you can go fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way to survive an avalanche is to outwit it by skiing a safer slope . WHAT 'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GRADE ( PERCENTAGE ) AND SLOPE ( IN DEGREES ) ? Grade and slope are both ways of expressing steepness , really . It 's just that highway departments and skiiers , generally speaking , have different ways of expressing themselves . Highway engineers use grade , a ratio ( which later gets assigned a percentage ) that indicates how long you must travel up or down a road for a vertical rise or drop of one foot . A 100 percent grade , therefore , would be sheer vertical  --  and really dangerous , given the lousy brakes on Flake 's ' ' 78 Subaru Brat . If one were to drive down Utah 's Big Cottonwood Canyon , one would see signs reading 5.5% GRADE , meaning that stretch of highway between Brighton and Salt Lake City is 5.5 percent of vertical . Skiers and avalanche experts , on the other hand , go by simpler geometry-class measurements  --  expressing steepness as an angle of degree , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The takeaway ? Skiing is most enjoyable on slopes between 30 and 55 degrees ; driving is not . HOW LONG WILL MY SKIS LAST ? That depends on what 's inside , and how hard you ski " em . Cheap injection-molded foam-core skis ( read : box-store closeouts ) are the cholesterol-plagued chain smokers of their species , suffering a reduced life span with each mogul they smack . ScottyBob skis ( custom-built in Silverton , Colorado ) , however , attempt Viagra-esque staying power through the use of sugar maple  --  a wood so hard it 's commonly found in bowling lanes . Craftsmanship is crucial , too . Atomic 's Sugar Daddy , for example , is famously durable despite a core made of Densolite foam . Still , land a 30-footer on a rock , and even the toughest ski can snap . So heed Flake 's advice : Find a good salesman and tell him exactly how you ski . And be sure to aim for the snow . WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT TO A PRO FREESKIER 'S CAREER : FILM APPEARANCES OR COMPETITION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winner , " because ski company reps often yawn when winners beg for sponsorship . The biggest names in freeskiing have n't competed in years . They film all winter long , though , because their sponsors know the number of spectators at a contest is dwarfed by the masses who attend ski flicks and watch the DVDs . Sure , competitions can be a stepping stone toward sponsorship , but would owners of the K2 Seth Vicious ( Seth Morrison 's signature model ) spend $750 on skis named after Peter Velisek , Ben Wheeler , or Manu Gaidet ? No , because they 'd have to ask , " Who ? " And Flake would have to explain that said athletes are last season 's winners of the biggest freeskiing comps in Canada , the U.S. , and France , respectively , and everyone would get sleepy , very sleepy .
