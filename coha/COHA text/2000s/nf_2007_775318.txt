Trachoma // Trachoma is the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world , but it is still known as one of the " neglected " diseases . It is caused by infection and can be treated , but 7 million people have been stricken blind by trachoma . An additional 500 million , usually the poorest and most forgotten in communities that are already struggling for survival , are at risk . In African countries , these are often areas where lymphatic filariasis , Guinea worm , schistosomiasis , and onchocerciasis are also endemic . // I knew about cases of trachoma as a boy , and I often had conjunctivitis , or sore eyes . As is the case now in our targeted areas of Africa , flies were everywhere , breeding in the excrement from both animals and humans . Our barn lot was nearby , and chickens , ducks , and geese ran freely in the yard . Screened doors and windows helped , but we also had to put a piece of gauze on top of any open pot or pitcher to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , my mother was a nurse and a stickler for cleanliness , and our family had the only outdoor privy in the community . Trachoma was considered a threat to America in those early years , so doctors at Ellis Island used buttonhooks to examine the undersides of immigrants ' eyelids and shipped those with trachoma back to their home countries . // Trachoma is caused by fi lthy and infected eyes , beginning as conjunctivitis and ultimately causing the upper eyelids to turn inward . Every blink drags the eyelashes across the corneas , causing pain like a thorn in the eye and then permanent blindness . The disease can be transmitted by contact with an infected person , by hands , a towel , or a garment , or carried by flies that have come in contact with discharge from infected eyes . Transmission is enhanced by an intimate relationship between mother and child or within a family or close-knit community . // Rosalynn and I had noticed during our visits to Masai and Dinka villages that , when seen from a distance , children appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that rings of flies were sucking moisture from their eyes . The children rarely brushed the flies away and had never been taught to wash their faces . // In 1997 , at the request of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation , The Carter Center decided to make a major effort to help control trachoma in Ghana , Mali , Niger , and Nigeria , countries where the average annual income ranges from $100 to $370 . We knew that trachoma only deepened the despair and poverty in these communities . // We began learning about the disease and raising funds to support the new program . Having been a district governor of Lions Clubs International during the mid-1960s , I knew that protecting eyesight was the organization 's major benevolent project . I went to their Chicago headquarters to relay our plans , and they pledged a total of $16 million for five years , permitting an expansion of our program to Ethiopia and Sudan . The Hilton Foundation promised $13.6 million for a total of ten years . // The first cases of trachoma that we saw were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I were joined by Jim Ervin , president of Lions Clubs International , and leaders of Lions Clubs in the country . Through an interpreter , we talked to a blind grandmother who said she was thirty years old . She was holding in her arms a little boy , about the same age as Amy 's son , our youngest grandchild . Someone said , " The fl ies cluster shoulder to shoulder around an infected eye . " With proper treatment , the grandson would never be blind . // Along with other organizations involved in the International Trachoma Initiative , we use the acronym SAFE as a guide to treatment : S = surgery , A = antibiotic , F = face cleaning , and E = environment . // Before surgery , victims carry crude tweezers , with which they pluck out all their eyelashes , but the hairs grow back even sharper . We are able to train nurses or physician 's assistants to perform the simple surgery , a fi fteen- minute procedure , to restore the eyelids to their normal position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream into eyelid surgery camps run by the government and paid for by The Carter Center . We prefer a month of training , which costs six hundred dollars per worker , plus eight hundred dollars for two surgical instrument kits each . The materials for each operation cost about ten dollars . // In September 2000 , Jim Ervin went with me to the headquarters of Pfizer Inc , the world 's largest pharmaceutical company , where we met with corporate leaders and I spoke to several hundred of their assembled employees about trachoma . I described the SAFE program and emphasized that their antibiotic Zithromax ? had proven to be most effective against the infection . I described how Merck had been contributing free Mectizan ? for the treatment of onchocerciasis , and their CEO , William Steere , offered to provide Zithromax ? whenever we could set up an effective system in a country for its use . Subsequently , Pfizer has expanded this commitment so that it now includes more than 135 million treatments . This is an invaluable contribution in fifteen of the fifty-five countries where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , teachers , or health workers to keep their faces clean , and the plethora of flies can be reduced by maintaining a sanitary environment using methods that are taken for granted in the developed world . // We combat trachoma in six countries , but our most intense effort is in the Amhara region of central Ethiopia , the most severely affected place in the nation . Our survey revealed that up to 80 percent of children there had early stages of the disease . Approximately 1.25 percent of all Ethiopians are blind , the highest incidence in the world , and more than 80 percent have some form of trachoma . Because mothers look after the children and children are the most heavily infected , women are three times more likely to develop the late stage of the disease . Usually the main workers in the house , women incapacitated with trachoma become a special burden . While their children may care for older blind women , younger women are frequently divorced by their husbands and sent back to their parents . In some communities in Ethiopia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen years old are going blind and risk these social and economic punishments for their illness . // Dr. Paul Emerson joined The Carter Center as director for the Trachoma Control Program in November 2004 . He had devoted nearly a decade to operational research and program evaluation in support of the global effort to control the disease , and under his leadership we quickly extended programs begun by Dr. Jim Zingeser to encourage face washing . Our latest reports from teachers and others show that more than 60 percent of the children are proudly demonstrating clean faces each morning . // The next stage of our program proved the most interesting and earned me a new reputation in Ethiopia . We learned that it was taboo for women to relieve themselves where they could be seen . They had to either defecate and urinate within their living compounds or restrain themselves until dark . One woman told Dr. Emerson , " I am a prisoner of daylight ! " We decided to distribute simple plans for the construction of latrines : just dig a hole in the ground ; fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would n't cave in ; and enclose it for privacy with brush , clay , or cloth . A latrine could be constructed for a cost of less than a dollar . // As latrines were being built and cleanliness became more important , many communities did not have access to enough soap , and they revived the lost craft of soap making . This provided not only an affordable method of sanitation but also a new product that women could sell to generate income . // We set an ambitious goal in Amhara district of ten thousand latrines during the first year , but we underestimated the power of women who saw them as a form of liberation . Family by family and village by village , latrine building was adopted as a major project , and 306,000 latrines were built within three years ! We encouraged families to hang a gourd filled with water at each entrance , with a tiny hole at the bottom plugged with a stick . When we visited the area in 2005 , people were especially proud to show us how they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I became known as the Father of Latrines. // Malaria // There is an apparent anomaly in the current statistics from the World Health Organization on annual deaths from diseases in the developing world , which seem to underestimate the ravages of malaria . In order of deadliness , ( 1 ) respiratory diseases come fi rst at 4 million deaths per year , followed by ( 2 ) HIV/AIDS , 3 million , ( 3 ) malaria , 1 to 5 million , ( 4 ) diarrhea , 2.2 million , and ( 5 ) tuberculosis , 2 million . But the organization also states , " Malaria kills more than three thousand children each day in sub- Saharan Africa , " which amounts to 1.1 million annually just for this age group and geographic area . In Ethiopia , we know that annual deaths from HIV/AIDS are 130,000 , while 270,000 die from malaria . This devastating disease causes a lifetime of suffering from chills , diarrhea , pain , and high fevers , with its fatalities concentrated among pregnant women and children in their first five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was growing up during the Great Depression , and it was not until 1946 that the Communicable Disease Center ( CDC ) was established , primarily to eliminate this disease . A year later , a vast effort was begun to screen houses and to spray outdoor wet places with DDT , and by 1950 only two thousand cases were reported . Malaria was considered eradicated from the United States by 1951 . ( The CDC subsequently became known as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . ) Meanwhile , the insecticide DDT has been banned from outdoor use in most nations since its devastating effect on wildlife became known . // Along with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis , malaria qualifies as one of the " big three " diseases for which nations can qualify for financial grants from the Global Fund , a public-private partnership based in Switzerland . Nations that receive grants must quickly demonstrate that the money is being used wisely and effectively . In 2006 , Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi decided to make an all-out effort to reduce the threat of malaria throughout his nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership with the government ministries . // The plan was to utilize one of the most remarkable technological innovations of recent years  --  bed nets made of fi bers that are impregnated before weaving with a pesticide whose lethal effect on mosquitoes would last for about seven years . Instead of merely being repelled by the nets , the insects would be killed on contact . There were 50 million people living in the endemic areas of Ethiopia , which meant that 20 million nets would be needed to provide an average of 2 per household . It would be a massive project to identify the communities to be included , acquire the nets , distribute them , and then ensure their proper installation , use , and care . The government would acquire 17 million nets using a portion of its Global Fund grant , its own resources , and support from other donors . We agreed to provide the remaining 3 million , be responsible for distributing bed nets in the areas where we already were controlling onchocerciasis and trachoma , and monitor the results for the seven-year period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be used to spray interior walls of homes while being strictly prohibited from outdoor applications . // We located fourteen regional storage areas and began buying the bed nets before launching our six- month distribution effort in January 2007 . It is hard to imagine the volume of 3 million nets . One enormous pile was named " Carter 's Mountain . " The total cost of our Center 's portion of the malaria program in Ethiopia will be $46 million , an amount that we are attempting to raise from private contributors . This is the largest project in a single country that we have ever undertaken . // Advantages for our Center include a thorough knowledge of the malaria-endemic areas , derived from our battles against Guinea worm , trachoma , and onchocerciasis , along with a large cadre of trained native health workers who can now combine their efforts against several diseases simultaneously . As previously mentioned , the most direct ancillary benefit will be against lymphatic filariasis , since mosquitoes also spread this disease . // Task Force for Disease Eradication // The International Task Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter Center in 1988 to evaluate disease control and prevention and the potential for eradicating infectious diseases . Composed of scientists and notable international health organizations from around the world , the task force fi rst met from 1988 to 1992 , concluding that six diseases  --  dracunculiasis , poliomyelitis , mumps , rubella , lymphatic filariasis , and cysticercosis  --  could be eradicated . Some of these targets proved to be unrealistic , even if theoretically feasible . Guinea worm and polio eradication were already under way , but this ITFDE report has led to a new effort to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. // In June 2001 , we were able to secure support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and resumed the effort to review progress in disease eradication and to make recommendations regarding opportunities for eradication or better control of certain diseases . Two diseases ( Guinea worm and polio ) have been designated by the World Health Organization for worldwide eradication , and five others ( leprosy , lymphatic filariasis , river blindness , trachoma , and schistosomiasis ) for elimination or dramatic reduction in specific regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five of these seven diseases ( all except polio and leprosy ) . In 2006 , the ITFDE encouraged the Dominican Republic and Haiti to cooperate in eliminating malaria and lymphatic filariasis from the island of Hispaniola , and in 2007 it continued to monitor the potential for eliminating onchocerciasis in selected areas of Africa . // The task force also analyzes major diseases that become vulnerable to control thanks to new scientific knowledge or technological innovation . One notable example is the long-term impregnated bed nets for combating mosquito-borne malaria and lymphatic filariasis. // Agriculture // Shortly after we left the White House , Rosalynn and I had a visit from Ryoichi Sasakawa , one of the most remarkable men we have known . // Our first encounter with him was when his staff members called and requested permission to visit us at our home in Plains , along with Reverend Wayne Smith , founder of the Friendship Force . When the elderly Japanese man first entered our home , he expressed amazement that we lived in " such a humble dwelling . " His second utterance was " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I want to make an initial contribution of $500,000. " // This was obviously a favorable introduction , and we soon learned more about Mr. Sasakawa 's background . He had been a famous fighter pilot in World War II , and at the war 's end was imprisoned by General MacArthur for three years for alleged corruption and subversive activities involving Japan 's military operations in the Orient . During this time of incarceration he devised an ingenious scheme for rejuvenating Japan 's devastated industrial capability . When finally freed ( without having been put on trial ) , Sasakawa developed a legal and official gambling syndicate . Since there were no lotteries , horse racing , or dog racing events , he built a network of lakes throughout Japan and designed standard speedboats on which bets could be placed . // The organization was first named the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation , and several Japanese cabinet members , including the minister of transportation and finance , were designated to serve as directors . Gambling profits amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars , and practical control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we first met him , he had established several benevolent organizations around the world , one of which was the United States-Japan Foundation , which he endowed with $50 million . Sasakawa also made large contributions to UN agencies and expressed an interest in forming a partnership with The Carter Center to meet some benevolent needs in the developing world . // After several years of exploratory discussions , we decided to convene a meeting in Geneva with Sasakawa , the scientist Norman Borlaug , and me presiding . Our purpose was to find ways to increase the production of food grains in Africa , beginning with four nations as test cases . We selected Sudan , Ghana , Tanzania , and Zimbabwe so that we could employ the different seasons north and south of the equator . Sasakawa 's foundation would provide the funding , I would represent The Carter Center in negotiating contracts with leaders of selected nations , and Borlaug would implement some of the agricultural techniques that had made him famous and earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 as the father of the Green Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project would be called Global 2000 ( later changed to Sasakawa-Global 2000 ) . // Along with our health programs , work with farm families in their fields gave us an unprecedented insight into their cultural practices . After our Global 2000 agriculture program had been implemented for a few years , we traveled to a few of the nations to honor the most outstanding farmers . One such visit was to a rural village in Zimbabwe about 125 miles from the capital city , Harare . I dressed that morning in the hotel as though I would be going to our own farm near Plains. // When we finally arrived at the site , we found several hundred villagers assembled in the village square , with young men and women already costumed and dancing . We were guided to two large trees , where a small man , proudly dressed in a wrinkled suit and tie , was standing under one of the trees and holding a plaque designating him as the outstanding farmer of the year . After exchanging ceremonial honors with the village chief and other dignitaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , served by his wife and daughters . When we finished eating , I suggested that we proceed to some of his fields to observe his agricultural management techniques . The vehemence of his objections was surprising , with an emphasis on the need to go through his animal pen , the heat of the midday sun , the likelihood of getting my clothes dirty , and the distance to the growing crops . // Pointing out that I was a farmer myself , accustomed to livestock manure and dressed in my work clothes , I finally prevailed , and our small entourage moved toward his cultivated fi elds , with his wife walking behind us with Rosalynn . On the way , the farmer and I exchanged comments about his cattle , and he was quite knowledgeable about this phase of his enterprise . Since our G2000 programs were restricted to food grains , I was eager to reach his field of maize ( corn ) , whose quality had earned his honors . We could all see that it was an outstanding crop , approaching any yield that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a courtesy , I asked a series of questions : " How wide do you space your rows ? " " What variety of maize did you choose ? " " When did you apply the fertilizer , and what formula was used ? " " Did you have any problem with insects ? " // It quickly became obvious that our host knew nothing about the crop . Finally , he just turned to his wife , who provided all the answers . She was obviously the only farmer in the family , and she and the children had made all the decisions and done all the work , while her husband took care of the cattle  --  and the money when the crop was sold . //
