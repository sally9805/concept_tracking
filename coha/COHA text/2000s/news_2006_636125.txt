<p> RANDOM THOUGHTS <p> SOX MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AHEAD <p> Random thoughts while thinking all teams  --  including the 2005 world champion White Sox  --  go through slumps : <p> - Not that the Sox ' three-game series beginning tonight in Detroit against the Tigers is of the make-or-break variety , but ... A friendly reminder that after the Sox and Tigers square off at Sox Park Sept. 18-20 and three at Minnesota , while the Tigers conclude with three at Kansas City , three at home against Toronto and three at home against Kansas City . <p> - You know it 's a strange world when the day has come that the turmoil at Tribune Tower would be less for the Cubs  --  as woeful as they might be  --  than it is for other parts of the operation . <p> - During Sunday 's ESPN telecast of the Cubs-Mets game , broadcaster Jon Miller was recalling how in 2001 San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds and shortstop Shawon Dunston bet whether Bonds would break the big-league record for home runs . Dunston thought he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which meant Dunston won the bet : a new Mercedes-Benz . Left unsaid was whether the vehicle was performance-enhanced . <p> - Maybe next year ESPN wo n't schedule the ESPY awards show for after what is supposed to be a three-hour baseball game . Either that , or wo n't schedule it for after a game involving the Cubs pitching staff . <p> - A reliable source says beer sales at Wrigley Field were stopped early Sunday  --  in the top of the sixth inning when the Cubs were giving up 11 runs . The word went out to vendors after the Mets ' second grand slam that prompted some fans to toss debris on the field . Finally , some throws at Wrigley that hit the cutoff man . How sobering . <p> MANAGING FINE <p> JOE SAYS NO TO ALL-STAR MEDDLING <p> The commissioner 's plan to have All-Star Game pitchers be held out of contests the Sunday before the Midsummer Classic needs to be nipped in the bud . <p> As in Bud Selig , the man who last week proposed the plan to ensure rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something we ought to think about . " <p> Florida Marlins manager Joe Girardi has . <p> Maybe Selig &; Co. should have thought it through . <p> It 's crazy to me , " Girardi told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel . If you end up losing the wild card because you saved a pitcher on Sunday , how do you answer to your boss and the fans ? How do you answer to your team ? <p> I know Bud wants to have the best players in it , but sometimes that 's how the rotation works out . The team comes first . " <p> As opposed to television ratings . <p> IT 'S ALL POLITICS <p> SIR CHARLES APPEARS TO HAVE CHANGED SIDES <p> Charles Barkley , whose golf game has found its share of sand traps , would like to debunk any perceived bunker mentality  --  regarding his politics . <p> The former NBA star was part of the scene at the American Century Celebrity Golf Championships in Stateline , Nev. , where he finished last  --  unless you count former Notre Dame football coach Lou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a Friday concert ( though not the golfing ) was former vice president Dan Quayle , who was offended when singer John Mellencamp introduced one song with : This next one is for all the poor people who 've been ignored by the current administration , " Internet site TravelGolf.com reported via witnesses to the event . <p> I did n't appreciate the comment , and besides , I did n't think the show was very good , " Quayle is said to have said as he exited after the remark . <p> He 's right , " Barkley told the Web site of Mellencamp . The word conservative means discriminatory practically . It 's a form of political discrimination . What do the Republicans run on ? Against gay marriage and for a war that makes no sense . ... That and immigration . Another discriminatory argument for political gain . " <p> A longtime Republican , Barkley does not spare Democrats , saying they have done a horrible job . " <p> They spend all this time and energy getting on George Bush , " Barkley said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy and two years from another election , we do n't have a front-runner or a plan . " <p> We ? <p> I was a Republican until they lost their minds . " <p> DRAWING A WALK <p> METS ' HIGHER POWER HITTER <p> Maybe now , the Cubs ' collapse Sunday is understandable . <p> OK , maybe not . <p> It would be a bit of a stretch to think powers beyond that of mere mortals had much  --  if anything  --  to do with the New York Mets ' 11-run sixth inning Sunday . <p> That said , there may be some salvation involved in all that . <p> It all depends on how you look at it . <p> The New York Post 's Phil Mushnick might have seen the light the day before when he viewed the Mets and Cubs on his television set . And if not the light , he at least saw a commercial featuring Mets third baseman David Wright in his uniform at Shea Stadium . <p> Wright 's TV pitch : Hi , I 'm David Wright . I invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaerock Lee , at Madison Square Garden , July 27 , 28 and 29 . " <p> Followed by footage of a man tossing away two crutches and a woman forsaking a wheelchair to walk across a stage . <p> Sorry , boys and girls , while we mean no offense toward anyone 's spirituality and religious devotion  --  Wright 's included  --  that was the weirdest player/team-connected TV ad we 'd ever seen within a telecast of a big-league game , " Mushnick wrote . <p> And are Mets telecasts and Mets dressed in their Mets uniforms now available to help deliver religious come-ons of any and all kinds ? <p> But above and beyond all that , why is Wright telling us about the Rev. Dr. Lee ? If this holy man can spring people from wheelchairs , should n't Wright , at the very least , be telling Victor Zambrano ? " <p> TRAVEL PLANS <p> HINGIS TAKING FIRST TRIP TO INDIA <p> Oh , Calcutta . <p> Martina Hingis is headed there in September for the WTA Sunfeast Open . <p> It will be the Indian debut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world  --  who returned to the women 's tour in January after a three-year retirement . <p> Indian doubles standout Mahesh Bhupathi , who won the Australian Open mixed doubles with Hingis in January , has a sports management company that organizes the event . <p> She epitomizes the perfect modern-day tennis player , capable of playing on all surfaces and on all conditions , " he said . <p> I have heard a lot about Indian tradition and the excitement the WTA is creating in the country , " Hingis , 25 , said . <p> I 'm very excited to come and play in front of passionate tennis fans . " <p> TOUGH CROWD <p> LANCE 'S COMEDY CAREER MAY HEAD DOWNHILL <p> If it 's Monday in July , it must be Lance in France . <p> And it was , although seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong was merely something of a tourist at the top of L'Alpe d'Huez for the Tour 's rest day . <p> The sport 's retired superstar is to join former team director Johan Bruyneel  --  who helped guide Armstrong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's 15th stage from Gap to L'Alpe d'Huez . Armstrong is expected to leave the Tour on Wednesday for a few days of relaxation before rejoining the race for Sunday 's conclusion in Paris . <p> In case anyone was wondering whether Armstrong was trying to distance himself from some of the material in his ESPY Awards monologue from the program that aired Sunday . <p> Now I know what you 're thinking : What am I doing up here ? " he told the ESPY audience . Well , the truth is it 's the same thing as the rest of you . I 'm a huge fan of Lance Armstrong . I do n't know if you know or not , but I 'm the first athlete to host this show . And why did I do it ? Are you kidding me ? I told the producers I 'd give my left nut to host this thing . ... I had some great times in France , but I have to say it 's great to be back in a country that I pee simply because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or not , but France actually made it to the World Cup finals . All of their players tested positive ... for being bleeps . <p> Fresh off his Oscar nomination for Brokeback Mountain , ' my good friend Jake Gyllenhaal is here . Jake , why are you sitting in the front ? I thought you liked it in the rear . " <p> So much for Armstrong 's wholesome image .
