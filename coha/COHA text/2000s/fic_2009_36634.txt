Never appear to be too captivated by a gentleman , particularly if it is true . Revealing your weakness for him will give him the upper hand , and a woman needs all the power she can muster if she is to triumph . <br>  --  An Anonymous Lady , Advice to Young Ladies on Capturing a Husband <br> London , September 1817 <br> " Eleanor , my dear , the worst has happened ! Wrexham is here . " <br> Her heart leaping at her aunt 's disconcerting news , Lady Eleanor Pierce froze on the sidelines of the crowded hall . " Here ? Tonight ? At Carlton House ? " <br> " Indeed . His arrival was just announced . " Elea ? nor 's proper aunt and chaperone , Lady Beldon , made a sour face . " The nerve of him ! He should have the decency to respect your sensibilities . " <br> Eleanor agreed that Damon Stafford , Viscount Wrexham , had a great deal of nerve . In truth , Damon was the boldest man of her acquaintance . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again  --  or so she 'd believed until just this moment . <br> Eleanor smiled in an effort to pretend composure and to slow her all too rapid heartbeat . " I daresay Lord Wrexham has a right to attend Prinny 's fete , Aunt Beatrix . No doubt he was invited , just as we were . " <br> George , Prince of Wales and currently England 's Regent , regularly entertained at Carlton House , his garishly grand London residence . And Lady Beldon was sometimes included on the guest list , since her late husband had been an intimate of the pleasure-loving Regent 's set . <br> Tonight the overheated mansion was filled with a crush of elegant gentry and aristocrats . Yet a surreptitious glance around the thronged hall told Eleanor that the charming rake who had once won her heart and then trampled on it was nowhere in sight . <br> " You make too much of the matter , " Eleanor murmured , hiding her relief . " Wrexham is perfectly at liberty to move about society as he pleases . " <br> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not mean to defend him ? After he treated you so abominably ? " <br> " No , certainly not . But I am resigned to meeting him again . It must happen eventually . He has been in London for a sennight , and we move in similar circles . " <br> Lady Beldon shook her head in disgust , then studied her niece more closely . " Perhaps we should take our leave , Eleanor . I will tender our excuses to Prinny  --  " <br> " I have no intention of running from Lord Wrexham , dearest Aunt . " <br> " Then you must prepare yourself . He may appear at any moment . " <br> Nodding distractedly , Eleanor drew a deep breath . She was as prepared as she would ever be to encounter the wickedly charming nobleman who had been her betrothed . <br> She 'd had several days ' warning that Damon had returned to London after a two-year absence , since Lady Beldon 's friends were eager to keep her abreast of society gossip . Eleanor had carefully planned what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . She would be gracious and cool and completely indifferent , showing him common politeness but no more . <br> " I am capable of facing him with equanimity , " she avowed , her calm assertion belying the butterflies rioting in her stomach . <br> Aunt Beatrix , however , was neither convinced nor willing to excuse his lordship 's past sins . " You should not be compelled to face that scoundrel . Were he a true gentleman , he would have the good manners to stay away . " <br> " He has stayed away , " Eleanor said with a dry edge to her tone . " For two years . " <br> " Even so , his absence was not long enough ! Indeed , I think he should be banned from polite society entirely . " <br> Regrettably , Damon 's crime against her did n't quite justify so severe a punishment , Eleanor reflected . " I suspect banishment might be a bit too harsh , darling Auntie . " <br> " Not in the least . And I will never forgive myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are not to blame . You did not actually introduce us , if you will recall . " <br> The elder woman waved an elegant hand in dismissal . " Wrexham met you at my annual house party , which amounts to the same thing as an introduction . Had I not welcomed him into our home , you would never have been exposed to heartbreak and ridicule . But he was a friend of Marcus 's . How could we know he would turn out to be such a libertine ? " <br> How indeed ? Eleanor wondered silently . <br> Her beloved older brother Marcus had thought very highly of Damon until the eventful dissolution of her betrothal  --  as had she . With his stirring good looks and his reckless , devil-may-care charm , Damon was every young lady 's illicit fantasy , and every matron 's worry . <br> As far as motherly natures went , Beatrix Attree , Viscountess Beldon , harbored very few nurturing instincts . Yet she 'd taken in Eleanor after her parents ' deaths when she was but ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Beatrix loved Eleanor as much as she was capable of loving anyone . <br> Her ladyship was an aristocrat to the core , and she had strict notions of what was proper for the nobility . In the beginning she 'd made allowances for Lord Wrexham , despite his rather wild reputation , because he held an illustrious title that went back several hundred years and a fortune that was even larger than Eleanor 's . <br> For her own part , Eleanor had cared little for Damon 's title or wealth . It was the nobleman himself who inspired her ardor . The first moment they met , she 'd felt a lightning bolt of attraction for him , as well as a connection she rarely experienced with any other man . <br> Falling in love with him had been ridiculously easy . <br> Of course , her foolishness in succumbing to his irresistible allure could possibly be excused by her relative youth at the time . She was only nineteen then , and in her girlish heart she had yearned for a wildly romantic love . A suitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desired , just as Damon did . <br> She 'd been spellbound for those few short weeks of their whirlwind courtship and engagement , believing they were ideally matched , that Damon was the man of her dreams . She had expected  --  hoped  --  to live with him happily ever after as his wife . Until that fateful morning two years ago when she spied him driving in Hyde Park with his beautiful mistress , not only not bothering to hide his affair but actually flaunting it . <br> Feeling grievously hurt and betrayed , Eleanor had immediately terminated their engagement and vowed to have nothing more to do with Damon . He had broken her heart as well as severely embarrassing her and savaging her pride . Even now , she could n't quell her lingering resentment . Yet she refused to cower at the thought of facing him  --  <br> " Well , " Lady Beldon announced , breaking into her niece 's thoughts , " if you insist on staying tonight , you would do well to keep Prince Lazzara by your side in the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I shall , Aunt . His highness only stepped away to fetch some refreshments for us . " <br> An Italian nobleman , Principe Antonio Lazzara di Terrasini had come to England in the company of his elder distant cousin , il Signor Umberto Vecchi , who was a diplomat to the British court . Reportedly the prince was in the market for a bride and was considering Lady Eleanor for the position . <br> Eleanor well knew that her chief attractions had little to do with her character or intellect . She was a notable heiress in her own right , due to the extensive fortune left to her by her mother . She was also the daughter of a baron , and now the sister of an earl , since her elder brother Marcus had recently inherited the Danvers earldom from his own distant relation . <br> However , she had n't yet decided how seriously she wished to be considered as Prince Lazzara 's future princess . Admittedly she was attracted to him . His sensual voice and melting dark eyes were the very essence of romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and witty  --  and from all reports , as much of a rake as Damon had ever been . <br> And after her disastrous betrothal to Damon  --  followed by a second , even briefer betrothal to another nobleman shortly afterward  --  Eleanor was adamant that the next time she became engaged , it would be for good . More crucially , she would only marry a man whom she loved and who loved her in return . <br> Just then a hush fell over one end of the hall . Eleanor suspected that Prinny had entered with his entourage . But when her aunt stiffened and muttered " Speak of the devil " under her breath , Eleanor realized that it was not only His Royal Highness who had attracted attention . <br> Damon Stafford , Viscount Wrexham , stood beside the Regent , drawing all eyes , including hers . <br> The company began bowing and scraping fawningly to Prinny , while Lord Wrexham casually surveyed the elite gathering  --  and the gathering returned the favor . <br> Continues ...          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
