// Fresh from the garden , broccoli has an unbeatable , sweet , gourmet flavor . " It 's like eating green ! " according to my young son Zane . Plus broccoli is the most nutritious of the commonly eaten vegetables , loaded with vitamin A , vitamin C , riboflavin , calcium , potassium , iron and fiber . Although broccoli is closely related to cauliflower , brussels sprouts and cabbage , it is easier to grow and less susceptible to insect damage than any of those crops . Even the novice gardener can harvest a bountiful crop of broccoli for an extended time with a few simple tips . You can freeze any extra harvest for winter soups , quiches and casseroles . Broccoli thrives in cool weather and grows best when daytime temperatures are between 70 and 80 degrees . Where summer temperatures rarely top 80 degrees , you can grow broccoli all summer . Here in northeast Iowa , we plant in spring and again in late summer to avoid having broccoli mature during the hottest part of the summer . In hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only option . To beat the heat and get a jump on spring weeds , we start our spring crop in soil blocks or individual plant cells around March 7 , a little more than five weeks before the last hard frost here in our valley ( USDA Zone 4 ) . In coastal regions of the Southeast and Southwest , where winters are mild and summers are hot , growers start transplants in early January for transplanting in mid-February . Organic farmer Andres Mejides of Elfin Acres in southern Florida starts his broccoli transplants around Sept . I for a winter crop that matures in the coolest part of their season . Whether you plant your seeds indoors or out , cover the seeds with Y inch of soil or finished compost , and keep the soil moist for the best germination . In general hybrid varieties provide the best production of central heads and better performance in hot weather . But the plants of a single hybrid variety tend to mature over a short period of time . To keep the broccoli coming , plant more than one variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signal ' for early harvest , along with Arcadia , ' which matures about 13 days later . Fast-growing , vigorous plants produce the best crops , and dodge or outgrow many of the pest problems that can plague broccoli . Prepare the soil well , adding about 5 gallons of finished compost for every 100 square feet . Photograph // Space transplants or thin seedlings 10 to 24 inches between plants in 30-inch rows . In beds set plants 18 to 24 inches apart in every direction . Use close spacing for early , small varieties , and wider spacing for later , larger varieties . Widely spaced plants tend to produce more side shoots for an extended harvest . Set the transplants just slightly deeper than they were originally growing to encourage upright growth and a sturdy stem . Broccoli likes plenty of water , but not wet feet . If you get less than 1 inch of rain each week , irrigate deeply to make up the difference . Mulching with straw helps retain moisture and keep the soil cool . Mulch and irrigation both help to counteract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolting and misshapen head development , and even cause the head to rot . Photograph // Our first broccoli harvests come in late June , a good time to sow more seed for a fall crop . Final planting of a cold-hardy , long-season variety like ' Marathon ' in early July ( or about 90 days before your first hard fall frost ) ensures an extended fall harvest . Our children love to run down the rows looking for the first broccoli heads . About seven days after they find the first silver dollar-size button , the main head will be ready to harvest . The nubs on the broccoli are actually tightly clustered flower buds . Harvest the head after the flower buds begin to swell , but before they actually open . Once you have begun to harvest a given variety , keep picking every three or four days to avoid letting any heads go past . Commercial growers cut low on the stem to get the maximum weight on each head , but they typically harvest just once . To encourage the growth of side shoots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central head , cutting with a sharp knife at a 45 degree angle . Shortly after harvesting the central head , the side shoots will begin to develop , eventually resulting in a multiple harvest of 1- to 2-inch heads . To promote the best side shoot production , side dress with fertilizer just as the central head is beginning to form and provide consistent , deep watering .

Bottom right : ' Super Dome ' broccoli grows great and plentifully. // Cut the regrowth close to the main stem to encourage the continued production of larger , tastier shoots . Harvest regularly for maximum yields and be certain to keep the shoots from flowering . Once a broccoli plant succeeds in producing flowers , it puts all of its energy into seed production and stops growing delicious things to eat . As long as you keep on cutting , you 'll be amazed at how productive your plants will be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is tender and cooks quickly . When people say they dislike broccoli , it 's usually because the broccoli they tried was past its peak of freshness or overcooked  --  both bring out unpleasant-tasting sulfurous compounds . If there is a chance cabbageworms have invaded the heads , soak them in strong salt water for 15 minutes . The most basic preparation for broccoli is to separate the head into florets-the small flower clusters-and steam for eight to 10 minutes , until just cooked through . The color should be an even brighter green than you started out with , not gray and dingy . Open the lid just slightly to let the sulfur compounds escape . Do n't overlook the stems when you are cooking with broccoli . Stripped of their tough skins with a vegetable peeler or paring knife , broccoli stems make a delicious , slightly crunchy addition to any broccoli dish . Add them to soups or stir-fry , either as matchsticks or sliced into rounds . We serve broccoli stems and florets steamed and tossed with a vinaigrette salad dressing just as you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinegar , two parts toasted sesame oil , a little garlic and a pinch of salt , shaken well . With a seared chicken breast and a loaf of good bread , this can be a quick and delicious supper , on the table in half an hour . Broccoli goes quite well with spicy and salty flavors , so we often add ingredients like hot pepper flakes , chopped raw garlic or Parmesan cheese to steamed or sauteed broccoli . With parsley , dill or oregano , broccoli makes an excellent ingredient in a fresh garden egg scramble . For a new twist on broccoli , finely chop the broccoli stalks and florets . Steam lightly until almost tender , and season with olive oil , lemon juice , and salt and pepper . Prepared this way , broccoli takes on a completely new flavor and texture . Preserve any excess broccoli by splitting it lengthwise into pieces no more than 1 1/2 inches across . Blanch in boiling water for two to four minutes or steam for three to five minutes , depending on the size .
