<p> Versatile innovator <p> Georgia Tech alumna oversees development of hair accessories for Rubbermaid unit <p> Lisa King , senior director of innovation , research and development at Goody Products , knows a little something about a lot of things . <p> Before joining Goody , a unit of Atlanta-based Newell Rubbermaid , King worked for BellSouth in the science and technology group , and she began her career at Boeing Co. , where she led simulations for space station technology . <p> While at Georgia Tech , obtaining her three psychology degrees , she once flew with the Atlanta SWAT patrol on a helicopter surveillance mission for a school assignment . <p> Today King oversees product innovations at the manufacturer of hair accessories . She 's leading research and development of some of the hottest new items in hair accessories , like hair bands designed to stay put while you exercise and retractable hairbrushes that wo n't get stuck in your hair when you use them to curl long tresses . <p> The granddaughter of Georgia farmers , King is a native of Titusville , Fla. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Goody business card says you 're a principal at the company . Also , you 're a senior director of innovation , research and development . Can you explain that ? <p> A : There is a lot involved in bringing a successful , innovative , new product to market . I oversee the development of product prototypes , engineering drawings and detailed computer models that are used when a product is manufactured or when packaging for the product is constructed . My group is also charged with creating quality specification of our new products and ongoing quality testing of our existing products . <p> I also lead the advanced concepts group , which focuses on innovation . The group observes and measures consumer behavior . We hypothesize about many different solutions to meet the consumer needs . <p> We then work collaboratively with product managers and industrial designers from marketing who lead commercialization activities and introduce new products into the marketplace . These new products need to be protectable through patentable technology or other means . <p> Q : Are you using engineering psychology in your job today ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my training every day . Engineering psychology is the science of human behavior that occurs within a system or environment . As humans , we have certain cognitive and physical capabilities and limitations . We perceive and process information . We react to stress , temperature , noise and other inputs . Engineering psychology is an analytical field that seeks to deliver the best match between the human and the system he or she interacts with . <p> This ' best match ' can also be achieved with consumer products . When we develop a great new product , how do we best get the consumer 's attention and also send a ' signal ' to alert them that the design performs better than its competitors ? The signal may be a visible part of the product itself , such as the special tread woven into Goody StayPut elastics hair bands . <p> Q : You work with hair accessories . How does your own hair experience help you in your job ? <p> A : I have what I like to call ' disaster hair . ' It is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prone to frizz here in the humid South . I use our So Stylish paddle brush to help smooth and control my hair . <p> Q : At Goody , I hear you have " blue sky " sessions . What are those ? <p> A : A blue sky session is a turbocharged brainstorming event . So much of what goes on in the day-to-day work environment is structured , planned , scheduled and organized . Occasionally , it is important to refocus on what is often called the fuzzy front end of innovation and exercise the creative muscles . <p> A blue sky session lets folks spend time thinking about our consumers and their needs without immediately assessing feasibility or ruling out ideas that may initially seem too ' out there . ' One of our blue sky sessions was a treasure hunt in the city of Decatur . We had teams of designers , engineers and product managers searching throughout the city for ideas and examples of consumers and professional stylists using our products . <p> Team members took pictures and interviewed shop owners . They talked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual teams convened at a local dance studio to consolidate and discuss ideas that were generated from the day . <p> Q : While at Boeing , you led international neutral buoyancy simulations for space station hardware and software design . Can you explain what you did and how your experiences at Boeing help you today ? <p> A : The Neutral Buoyancy Simulator is a facility located at the George C. Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville , Ala . The facility is used to simulate weightlessness . It is a 1.5 million-gallon tank filled with water . The facility is large enough to contain full-size prototypes or mockups of space station elements or even the shuttle elements . It is designed to allow for simulation of extra-vehicular activity operations that might occur on orbit as part of space station assembly , inspection or repair . <p> I was test conductor for an international team of designers , scientists , operations specialists and astronauts who analyzed some of the activities we knew would occur on orbit during space station operations . We needed to verify that all the things the on-orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintain the space station could physically be performed . <p> The Neutral Buoyancy Simulator was recently decommissioned for active NASA testing but remains a historical landmark and a big part of the legacy of manned space flight . These days , most neutral buoyancy space simulations are conducted at a similar facility called the Weightless Environment Training Facility at the Johnson Space Center in Clear Lake , Texas . <p> Working with an international team to accomplish so many testing objectives critical to mission success was a great experience , and I still use things I learned then about teamwork , collaboration and large-scale project planning and execution today . <p> Q : I 'm told you once flew a helicopter surveillance mission with the Atlanta SWAT patrol . How did you get to do that ? <p> A : I called them and asked . Really , so many things are possible in life if you simply try . This was years ago as part of a class project at Georgia Tech on urban government . I remember the pilot telling me he lost a bet because he predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I loved the flight , and the perspective on the challenges of urban law enforcement and investigation that the experience gave me . <p> Q : Your bio says that you partake in scuba-based testing . Is that scuba diving ? <p> A : Well , we used to joke that scuba stands for ' some come up breathing again , ' but yes , you are correct , it is traditional scuba diving . <p> Q : Why did you want to learn how to do it ? What 's the draw ? <p> A : I 'm what you might call a working scuba diver . I only ever did scuba diving during neutral buoyancy simulations for Boeing , working with NASA on space station design . <p> THE LISA KING FILE <p> * Age : 45 <p> * Native of : Titusville , Fla . <p> * Family : Married 13 years , one child <p> * Education : Three Georgia Tech degrees : B.S. in applied psychology ( ' 84 ) ; M.S. in engineering psychology ( ' 88 ) ; Ph.D . in engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gardening , reading <p> * Favorite technology : Lomo special effects cameras , which she calls " decidedly low tech .
