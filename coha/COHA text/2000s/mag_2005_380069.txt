As the President 's annus horribilis nears what must be a blessedly welcome end for him and his aides , they have just a month to try to salvage what had been a promising postvictory year . Instead , Social Security reform died ; the U.S. death toll in Iraq passed 2,000 ; Katrina exposed the weakness of the Administration 's bench players ; a Supreme Court nominee fell ; a White House aide resigned under indictment . Even Karl Rove 's aura of imperturbability began to melt , not only because he is under investigation in the CIA-leak case but also  --  and more gravely for the G.O.P.  --  because for once he seemed unable to find a winning issue for his boss . If 2006 looks anything like 2005 , George W. Bush will not only hasten his own lame-duck irrelevance ; he will leave his party vulnerable in November 's midterms . <P> Which is why it 's curious and even a little dangerous for the White House to have picked immigration as the issue to planish a presidency 's rough edges . Few issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President plans to launch an extensive bully-pulpit campaign on immigration . He is scheduled to travel with Senator John McCain , who with Senator Edward Kennedy has co-written a bill that would give millions of illegal immigrants the chance to earn citizenship . That would enrage G.O.P. conservatives who believe the U.S. should secure its borders and deport illegal aliens , not reward them . <P> Like any good politician , Bush will try to play both sides . True , he 's consorting with McCain , and he has a long history on his party 's pro-immigrant left  --  " Family values do n't stop at the Rio Grande , " Bush has long said , in one of his **26;19103;TOOLONG locutions . " When you 're making 50 , and you look up north and see the chance to make $50 , and your kids are hungry , you 're going to come , " he told Larry King in 1999 . <P> But now he 's repackaging his views . As recently as January 2004 , Bush used his first policy announcement of that re-election year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain legal status for at least six years if they have a job and their employer vouches for them . The plan incensed conservatives . Talk-radio hosts and bloggers fanned resentment over " Press 1 for English " phone menus and borders porous to drugs and terrorists . In June , two months after a citizens ' group called the Minuteman Project began vigilante patrols of the Mexican border , Bush told lawmakers he had not understood how important border security was to his base . <P> That 's why Bush is calling this week for a series of border-security measures that will make his guest-worker plan look like an afterthought in his immigration policy . Bush will call for the hiring of more border guards and the use of more technology like unmanned aircraft and ground sensors to better police the borders . He will also push for increased holding facilities for illegal immigrants who are picked up . Roughly 100,000 a year benefit from a de facto " catch and release " policy , since there are n't enough beds for them .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
