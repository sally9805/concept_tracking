Walk into room 922 of the artificial intelligence lab at M.I.T. , and you may notice a winsome robot in the corner trying desperately to get your attention . When Kismet is lonely and spots a human , it cranes its head forward plaintively . It flaps its pink paper ears and vocalizes excitedly in a babylike patter . Kismet 's handlers call this an " attention-getting display . " You would have to have a heart of stone to ignore this cute little aluminum ... thing . <P> From a physical standpoint , Kismet is n't much of a robot . It ca n't walk and grab things , as many robots today can . It does n't even have arms , legs or a body . What sets Kismet apart is that it has been built with drives and equipped to engage in an array of interactions with people to satisfy those drives . In social terms , big-eyed , babbling Kismet may be the most human robot ever built . And it may be the closest we have yet come to building the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural way , like C-3PO from Star Wars . <P> Kismet is the creation of Cynthia Breazeal , a postdoc in the Humanoid Robotics Group at M.I.T. Breazeal has studied for years under Rodney Brooks , perhaps the leading figure in the world of robotics . Breazeal got the idea for Kismet when she was working with Cog , another robot in Brooks ' lab that was built to have the physical capacities of a human infant . Cog has a torso , a head and arms , and it can engage in simple tasks like turning a crank or playing with a slinky . Cog is physically gifted but completely lacking in social skills . <P> That deficiency was driven home to Breazeal one day when she was interacting with Cog . Breazeal put an eraser down in front of Cog , and Cog used its arm to pick the eraser up . When the robot put the eraser down , Breazeal picked it up . Breazeal and Cog continued taking turns picking the eraser up and putting it down . To an outside observer , it might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Cog 's mind just did n't work that way . It was while engaging in this deceptively human-feeling interaction that Breazeal decided to try to build a new kind of robot , one that could play the eraser game with her and mean it . <P> A CHILD OF SCIENCE <P> Breazeal was uniquely suited to the task of building this new robot . She grew up near the technology-rich area that would become Silicon Valley . Her father was a mathematician and her mother a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . Her parents raised her , she says , to be " protechnology . " Breazeal became captivated by robots at age 8 when she saw Star Wars for the first time . " I just fell in love with the Droids , " she says , especially R2-D2 . " But I was old enough to realize those kinds of robots did n't exist . " Growing up , she considered becoming a doctor and an astronaut . But she never gave up her interest in robots . When she studied astronomy , she was particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized form of robot . After graduating from the University of California at Santa Barbara , Breazeal went to M.I.T. in the early 1990s to become part of one of the world 's most innovative robotics labs .
