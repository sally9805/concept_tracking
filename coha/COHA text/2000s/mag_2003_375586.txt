Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi speaks freely and carries a big stick . He has revolutionized Italy 's perennially gray politics but drawn fire for his vast media holdings as well as for gaffes like a tasteless Nazi gibe directed at a German colleague and a knock on German tourists by one of his deputies . TIME 's Jeff Israely talked with him on the eve of his visit with President Bush . <P> THE U.S. HAS TAKEN A LOT OF CRITICISM IN EUROPE LATELY . WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT AMERICA THAT SOME EUROPEANS DO NOT UNDERSTAND ? <P> Some Europeans do n't understand that the world changed radically after Sept. 11 . On Nov. 10 , 2001 , in the most beautiful piazza in Rome , we organized a rally in solidarity with an attacked and offended nation and flew the U.S. flag . We were the only ones to do it , and we are proud . I think we are making some headway , though , with the idea that anti-Americanism and anti-globalization are not progressive politics but are pure ideological trash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLITICAL LEADERS . IS THERE A BOND YOU SHARE ? <P> It 's a matter of sympathos . That 's a Greek word from pathos  --  to understand and feel together . We share a clarity in the way you say things : yes is yes , no is no . We also share an ideal that whoever is the leader must show the people the right road . We only met two years ago , but I feel I know him like I know my grammar school friends . <P> THEY SAY WE LIVE IN THE AGE OF THE AMERICAN EMPIRE . ARE THERE LESSONS THE ROMAN EMPIRE CAN OFFER ? <P> My name is Silvio , not Caesar or Augustus . But the political tradition of ancient thought , filtered in Italy by Machiavelli , says one thing clearly : every prince needs allies , and the bigger the responsibility , the more allies he needs . <P> HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN YOUR OWNERSHIP OF THREE TELEVISION NETWORKS , THE LARGEST PUBLISHER IN ITALY AND OTHER MEDIA HOLDINGS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ? <P> My own TV stations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you demonstrate your independence ? By criticizing your own boss . I believe I was the most hands-off TV owner ever in Italy . Since I entered politics , I have n't made one phone call to my business group . <P> YOU CREATED PROBLEMS AT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT BY JOKINGLY REFERRING TO A GERMAN MEMBER AS " PERFECT " FOR THE ROLE OF A NAZI PRISON GUARD . HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT TO ADOPT A MORE CAUTIOUS APPROACH ? <P> I 'm not a traditional politician , and I have a sense of humor . I 'll try to soften it and become boring , maybe even very boring , but I 'm not sure if I 'll be able to . <P> HAS YOUR SUCCESS AS A BUSINESSMAN INFLUENCED THE KIND OF POLITICIAN YOU ARE ? <P> Private television in Italy , which I founded , became an element of liberty , in breaking the monopoly of state TV . The link between my experience as an entrepreneur and that of a politician is all in one word : freedom . <P> IT SEEMS THAT AT LEAST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEEKING URANIUM IN NIGER ORIGINATED WITH THE ITALIAN SECRET SERVICE . WAS THERE POLITICAL PRESSURE TO FIND PROOF OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION ? <P> There was no political pressure . I had no knowledge of these facts . <P> YOU SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ . IF NO WEAPONS ARE FOUND , WILL THE WAR BE CONSIDERED JUSTIFIED ?
