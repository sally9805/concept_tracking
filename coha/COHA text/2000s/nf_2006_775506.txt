Memoir : The Life Beyond // While writing this book on the afterlife , I kept being drawn back to stories that I 'd heard in India as a child . Parables are a powerful way to teach children , and many of the ones told to me have lasted all my life . So I decided to weave the book around tales of the kind I heard at home , around the temples , and at school , hoping that the reader would be enticed by a world where heroes battle darkness in order to emerge into the light . // In this case the hero is a woman , Savitri , and the enemy she must defeat is Yama , the lord of death . Yama shows up in her front yard one day , waiting to take away her husband the moment he returns from his work as a woodcutter . Savitri is terrified . What strategy could possibly turn Death away from his inexorable mission ? // I had no trouble imagining these characters . I was frightened for Savitri and anxious to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their world flowed easily into my own , because the India of my childhood was not that far removed from ancient India . I want to take a moment to convey what death and the world beyond meant back then . It may seem like a very esoteric place . If so , you can come back to it after reading the main body of the book . However mysterious and exotic , here is where I began . // What was most magical in my childhood was transformation . Death itself was seen as a brief stopping point on an endless soul journey that could turn a peasant into a king and vice versa . With the possibility of infinite lifetimes extending forward and backward , a soul could experience hundreds of heavens and hells . Death ended nothing ; it opened up limitless adventures . But at a deeper level , it 's typically Indian not to crave permanence . A drop of water becomes vapor , which is invisible , yet vapor materializes into billowing clouds , and from clouds rain falls back to earth , forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drop of water died along the way ? No , it undergoes a new expression at each stage . Likewise , the idea that I have a fixed body locked in space and time is a mirage . Any drop of water inside my body could have been ocean , cloud , river , or spring the day before . I remind myself of this fact when the bonds of daily life squeeze too tight . // In the West the hereafter has been viewed as a place akin to the material world . Heaven , hell , and purgatory lie in some distant region beyond the sky or under the earth . In the India of my childhood the hereafter was n't a place at all , but a state of awareness . // The cosmos that you and I are experiencing right now , with trees , plants , people , houses , cars , stars , and galaxies , is just consciousness expressing itself at one particular frequency . Elsewhere in spacetime , different planes exist simultaneously . If I had asked my grandmother where heaven was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , not only because it was full of love , but because it made sense to her that many worlds could comfortably inhabit the same place . By analogy , if you are listening to a concert orchestra , there are a hundred instruments playing , each occupying the same place in space and time . You can listen to the symphony as a whole or , if you wish , put your attention on a specific instrument . You can even separate out the individual notes played by that instrument . The presence of one frequency does not displace any of the others . // I did n't know it as a child , but when I walked around the crowded Delhi market where more humanity was packed into one bazaar than was possible to imagine , the world I could n't see was even more crowded . The air that I breathed contained voices , car noises , bird songs , radio waves , X-rays , cosmic rays , and an almost infinite array of subatomic particles . Endless realities lay all around me. // Every frequency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see . It 's natural to fear what we ca n't see , and since death snatches a person out of sight , we react to it with fear . I certainly was n't immune to this . The death of a pet made me anxious and sad ; the death of my grandfather , which happened suddenly in the middle of the night , was devastating . My younger brother kept running around the house crying , " Where is he ? Where is he ? " It would be years before I realized that the correct answer was " Here and everywhere . " // Different planes of existence represent different frequencies of consciousness . The world of physical matter is just one expression of a particular frequency . ( Decades later , I was fascinated to read that according to physicists , there is a background hum to the universe that is so specific as to sound like the note B-flat , although it vibrates millions of times lower than human hearing . ) In India a child would never hear such a complicated quasi-scientific idea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahabhutas : earth , water , fire , air , and space . These elements combined to form everything in existence , which sounds crude to someone versed in Western science , but it contained a valuable truth : All transformations come down to a few simple elements . // In the twentieth century Western science came to understand that all solid objects are actually made of invisible vibrations . In my childhood , solid things were seen to have a large portion of the earth element . To put it another way , solid things had dense vibrations , or vibrations on a lower plane . Vaporous things had a fine vibration , on a higher plane . // Just as there are different planes of material things , there are also different spiritual planes , a shocking notion to the pious Catholic brothers , mostly Irish , who were my teachers at school . To them the only spirit was the Holy Ghost that lived in heaven . We children were politic enough not to disagree , yet in our cosmos it only made sense that if the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual planes , known to us as Lokas , which in Western mystical circles became known as " astral planes . " There are an almost infinite number of astral planes , divided into a higher and lower astral world , and even the lowest ones vibrate at a higher frequency than the material world . // Long ago the West gave up trying to hear the music of the spheres , but in India it is believed that a person with finely tuned consciousness can go inward and actually hear the vibration of various higher planes . In the astral plane you can see your own body , for instance , yet it might change in age from moment to moment . // In the lower astral planes we find clairvoyance , telepathy , and other refinements of the five senses , as well as ghosts , disembodied souls , and spirits that for one reason or another are " stuck . " As a child I was certain that when a cat or dog paused to assess the air , it saw something I could n't . So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts both Eastern and Western , that lower astral planes sometimes sensed by humans in higher states of awareness are often sensed by animals . Nor was I surprised to meet a psychiatry resident who told me that if the hospital room was dimly lit enough , he could see  --  on the very edge of visibility  --  when the soul left a dying person . Every Indian child devours comic books about the exploits of various heroes who fought their battles in faraway Lokas . Slipping in and out of material existence was our version of traveling to outer space . Our comic book heroes would come across thought forms and thought clouds , astral bodies traveling during sleep , astral colors and auras . All these are vibrations in the lower astral plane . // In the Indian tradition every physical body is assigned an accompanying astral body . Your astral body is a complete mirror of your physical body ; it has a heart , liver , arms , legs , a face , etc. , but since it operates at a higher frequency , most people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a garment for the soul ; it gives it the appearance of being localized in the material world . In death , as the physical body begins to disintegrate , the departing soul enters an astral plane that corresponds to its existence on the material plane , the frequency that corresponds most closely to its former life . // The general notion that you go where you belong rested easily in my mind back then . I imagined dogs going to dog heaven , and people who loved dogs joining them . I imagined bad people no longer hurting anyone except themselves because they were isolated in a kind of karmic jail . This was consoling , an assurance that the good people who loved me but were now gone lived in a place of goodness . But my view had limitations . I was never sure whether my wise grandfather met his wise grandfather in the hereafter , who showed him how to proceed , or if that job was carried out by angels , or enlightened spirits . Much later when I began to research karma I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul moves according to its desire from one astral plane to another , projecting as in a dream whatever sights and people , guides and astral entities it needs for its own advancement . // All these planes ultimately were imagined by Spirit , just as it imagined the material world . The Indian word for Spirit was Brahman , which is Everything , the one consciousness that fills every plane of existence . But Indians are relaxed about terminology , as befits a very old culture . We said God . Rama . Shiva . Maheshwara . The important thing was n't the name but the concept of a single consciousness that creates everything and continues to do so in infinite dimensions at infinite speed . On the astral planes Spirit continues to play roles . There , one can actually see images of gods and goddesses , angels and demons . These are ultimately illusions , however , for each astral plane provides the experience of Spirit . Here , on our plane , we experience Spirit as matter , solidity . On the astral planes we experience subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call dreams . // The cosmos is nonlocal , that is , it ca n't be mapped as a location . After death we gradually stop being local . We see ourselves as we really are from the soul 's perspective : everywhere at once . This adjustment is probably the biggest obstacle any of us will encounter in the astral planes . Right now you are at the center of the universe because infinity extends in all directions , yet someone on the other side of the world is also at the center of the universe , because infinity extends on all sides of them , too . If both of you are centers of the universe , you must both be at the same location . The fact that you appear to be in different places is a sensory artifact . It 's based on sights and sounds , which are local events . You are not a local event . // Similarly , each moment is the center of time , because eternity stretches around each moment in all directions . Therefore every moment is the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no up or down , north or south , east or west . These are only points of reference for our convenience at our particular frequency ( i.e. , inside a body ) . The transformational process after death is not a movement to some other place or time ; it is just a change in the quality of our attention . You can only see what you vibrate to . // I had an uncle who loved to travel and visit the various saints and sages that so densely populate India . Sometimes , to my fascination , he brought me along . I saw renunciates who sat in one posture for years at a time ; others who barely breathed . I know now that my eyes were deceiving me . I only saw a chrysalis , inside of which marvelous transformations were taking place . Silently , these figures were tuning in to different frequencies beyond the outside world . Through a shift in attention they could speak to Rama ( or Buddha or Christ , though that was less likely in India ) . Deep meditation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consciousness . In the ER when someone dies of a heart attack , only to be resuscitated with reports of a near-death experience , he or she uses a different launching pad . In both cases there was a shift in the quality of attention . // The big difference is that when a cardiac patient goes into the light , the journey is involuntary . Those silent yogis from my past were exercising an intention . By having a desire at a deep enough level of awareness , they went through a process that parallels death . The senses fade one by one . ( The last one to leave when a person dies is sound , which was the first to come in at birth . This fits the Indian notion that the five elements come and go in a specific order ; since sound is the equivalent of vibration , which holds the body together , it makes sense that it would be the last to go. ) // As the gross senses become duller , the subtle senses sharpen . We still see and hear after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They consist of anything we want to see on the astral plane : celestial sights and sounds , heavenly beings , and brilliant lights . In near-death experiences the most typical manifestations are faces , voices , or an emotional presence . In other traditional cultures people might expect to encounter ghosts or animals . Often a dying person feels something subtle around him  --  a certain warmth , a faint form or sound before leaving the body . Somehow these can be accessed on the dying person 's vibrational frequency . Anyone who has spent time with the dying knows that they may say that they 've been joined in the room by a departed spouse or other long-dead loved one . Some kind of astral contact is being made in the transition zone from physical to subtle . // At death the astral counterpart of the physical body separates from it . According to Vedic teachings , the departed soul then sleeps for a time in the astral region , which I translate as its incubation period . New ideas percolate in the mind before they lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normally the soul sleeps peacefully , but if a person dies suddenly or prematurely , or has many unfulfilled desires , this sleep may be restless and disturbed . The horrors of a violent death would continue to reverberate , and so would more mundane torments like unrequited love or grief . Suicides experience the same inner pain that led them to take their lives . // Unfulfilled desires do n't have to be negative . A longing for pleasure also represents an inability to let go . My uncle the spiritual devotee heard many detailed accounts of souls stuck in lower astral planes . Days , months , and years are n't the yardsticks of the soul 's perspective . //
