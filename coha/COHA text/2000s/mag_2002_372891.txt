HERAT A hero of the anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban resistance , Tajik ISMAIL KHAN , loyal to the Jamiat party , is Afghanistan 's most powerful warlord , commanding 15,000 men , the country 's largest semiautonomous force . <P> MAZAR-I-SHARIF The country 's most celebrated warlord , Uzbek ABDUL RASHID DOSTUM has long been a strongman in the north . Though he still commands some 7,000 troops , lately his influence has been eroded by the rising power of Tajik USTAD ATTA MOHAMMED , whose force of 5,000 controls much of Mazar . Sporadic clashes between the rival factions have been temporarily defused . <P> KABUL The battles roiling again among regional warlords have been a headache for interim President HAMID KARZAI .

U.S. officers believe Zadran , who retains links with al-Qaeda and Taliban elements , may pose a danger to U.S. forces . <P> BAMIYAN With about 10,000 troops at his command , Hazara Shi'ite KARIM KHALILI holds sway over Bamiyan province , which has a Hazara majority . Unlike other leading warlords , he has little in the way of armor or heavy weapons . His prospects are limited in Afghanistan , whose population is predominantly Sunni . <P> KANDAHAR Pashtun GUL AGHA SHERZAI commands a small fiefdom in the south . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border settlement Spin Boldak . Sherzai is a U.S. ally , but he maintains ties with nearby tribes , some of which are pro-Taliban . <P> Note : Exact boundaries and status of some recently designated provinces , including Nuristan ( ca. 1991 ) and Khowst ( ca. 1995 ) , remain unclear .
