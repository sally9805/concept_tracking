A 2,300-mile boat trip down the Lena River , one of the last great unspoiled waterways , is a journey into Russia 's dark past  --  and perhaps its future as well <p> WE SHOVED off under the weeping sky of a late June dawn , the frost-scarred concrete tenements of Ust-Kut looming , unlikely spectators for the start of an expedition down Russia 's most pristine major river . Here , at least , the Lena River , which flows northward into Siberia , resembled less a primordial waterway than the aqueous graveyard of Russian civilization . It is both , of course . Russia 's expansion beyond the Ural Mountains , a move crucial to its rise as a global power , depended on the Lena to annex a wilderness so inhospitable that few at first would move there readily , or even voluntarily . <p> In czarist and Soviet Russia , the Lena served as a watery highway into an icebound hell of forced labor and exile , shackles and grief . Vladimir Lenin ( n Ulyanov ) may have confected his nom de guerre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Trotsky who did hard time along its remote shores . Yet the Bolshevik coup that Lenin led in 1917 ushered in the river 's most tragic era , when Joseph Stalin dispatched millions to hard labor and death in Siberia . Countless barges carried inmates from Ust-Kut  --  once the Soviet Union 's busiest inland port  --  to prison settlements on the river 's banks . <p> A trip down the Lena would be a very rare adventure as well as a novel approach to Russia 's ties to its gulag past . Since coming to power in 2000 , and especially following his reelection last year , President Vladimir Putin has reinforced executive authority , reasserted Kremlin control over recalcitrant regions , strangled the press and selectively persecuted oligarchs . To this day , Russians are a predominantly rural , small-town people , and to understand how Putin has managed to reverse a democratic momentum dating from Gorbachev 's perestroika of the 1980s , it 's revealing to look not to Moscow and St. Petersburg , where a Western-oriented elite has pushed for liberal reform , but to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the Baikal Mountains more than 2,600 miles east of Moscow , the Lena flows through the taiga ( mostly coniferous forest ) of the Siberian Plateau into the boggy lowlands and tundra of the Sakha Republic to empty , 2,700 miles later , into the stormy Laptev Sea , within the Arctic Circle . A few hundred miles from the river 's mouth lies one of the world 's coldest inhabited places  --  Verkhoyansk , where temperatures have plunged to minus 96 degrees Fahrenheit . The tenth-longest river in the world , the Lena is the only major Russian waterway flowing unimpeded by dams or hydroelectric stations . Its waters are clean enough to drink untreated . Along its shores dwell brown bear and wolves , moose and caribou . It is Russia 's river wild , and I had long wanted to sail it . <p> TO TRAVEL from Ust-Kut , where my 2,300-mile journey began , is no simple thing . Moscow and the government of the Sakha Republic ( in Russian , Yakutia ) , a semiautonomous region within greater Siberia , have reimposed restrictions on foreigners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help from the polar adventurer Dmitry Shparo , who wrestled permits for my journey from the Sakha authorities , the Federal Security Service ( the successor to the KGB ) , the Border Guards , and the Foreign Ministry . Dmitry also found me a guide , a 37-year-old Muscovite named Vadim Alekseyev . Beefy , with a pig-iron grip and a piercing gaze , Vadim spends six months a year adventuring in the Russian far North , enduring of his own volition the foul meteorological stew of blizzard , ice , rain and wind that Stalin 's victims suffered as punishment . <p> We would travel in a 17- by 5-foot inflatable raft built to Vadim 's specifications . Half of our 1,430-pound load would consist of fuel for its four-horsepower motor . Vadim carried a double-barreled shotgun , kept loaded . " You never know who or what might step out of the taiga uninvited , " he said . <p> On the late June day we set out , the weather was balmy , in the low 70s . Cutting a V through panes of liquid pewter speckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods and hills . Soon we were gliding atop burbling currents dappled with the turquoise of the sky , the green of firs , and the rippling zebra serrations of birches . That evening , as I set up my tent on the riverbank , Vadim lit a fire and cooked a dinner of oats and canned meat , preceded by a clove of garlic as a prophylactic . I was spellbound by the beauty of the taiga  --  the largest contiguous forest on earth , a primeval preserve here dominated by Siberian fir and Erman 's birch and several species of spruce . Vadim was n't moved . " This is n't the North yet , " he said dismissively . <p> IN THE 1550s , Czar Ivan the Terrible of Muscovy crushed Muslim Tatars west of the Urals , spurring Russian expansion into Asia . The Cossack leader Yermak Timofeevich defeated the ruler of Sibir ( Siberia ) in 1581 , whereafter the Russians began to absorb lands farther east . Lured by rumors of forests abounding in priceless furs ( mostly sable and ermine ) along a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lena in the 1620s . The Cossacks , from the steppes south of Russia , raised revenues for the sovereign in the form of a levy in furs , which they imposed on the sparse indigenous peoples , the semi-nomadic Evenks and Yakuts . <p> Opening up Siberia , the Cossacks hastened Russia 's transformation from a middle-sized European country into a Eurasian superpower covering one-sixth of the earth 's land surface . Siberia was eventually to yield resources far more precious than furs , including gold , diamonds , uranium and , most important nowadays , natural gas and oil . In Siberia lie the bulk of Russia 's 72 billion barrels of proven petroleum reserve ( the seventh-largest on earth ) and 27 percent of the world 's natural gas . Oil alone accounts for 45 percent of Russia 's export revenues , and finances 20 percent of its economy Only Saudi Arabia pumps more crude . <p> It was in 1683 that Cossacks founded Kirensk , about 180 miles downstream from Ust-Kut , as an ostrog , or stockaded town . When we arrived , five days out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shacklike shops and low wooden houses , mostly green or blue hovels sinking crookedly into the earth . Vadim deposited me on an antique dock . White poplar seed puffs drifted through the hot air , adding a dreamy languor to the scene disturbed only by groupings of groggy beggars in the doorways , their faces swollen pink from alcohol . <p> Ivan Pokhabov , a pallid , 27-year-old manager in a cash-register repair firm , and his technician , 22-year-old Pavel Ostrovsky , showed me the town ( pop . 15,700 ) . Our first stop was a site that made Kirensk briefly infamous in the last days of Soviet rule : the ruins of a two-story brick building . We entered and climbed carefully down a derelict staircase , into a basement strewn with spent beer and vodka bottles . The building had once been the Kirensk headquarters of the Stalin eras secret police , predecessor of the KGB . In 1991 , the corpses of more than 80 people were uncovered in the basement . They 'd been executed around 1938 for alleged " counterrevolutionary " activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched them bring the corpses out of the basement , " Ostrovsky said . <p> Olga Kuleshova , director of the Kirensk Regional Museum , said one of her uncles , the head of a local collective farm who was denounced in an anonymous letter to the secret police , numbered among the exhumed . " The executed were our best minds , the light of our nation , the cultured people among us , " Kuleshova said . " There were rumors that others , who were never found , were put on barges and drowned . " <p> I had heard many such stories during 11 years in Russia , but I was becoming alarmed by the indifference that many displayed toward atrocities in Stalin 's day . To me , the be fouled basement execution site showed what little importance people attached to the state-sponsored murders . Could anything like Soviet-era purges repeat themselves now ? " Oh , all that could never happen again , " Ivan said . " We have our freedoms now . Everything is permitted . " <p> A few days later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bespectacled collector of historical artifacts for local museums , expressed a different view " Look , like everyone else , I cried in 1953 when Stalin died . Those who remember Stalin remember the order , the discipline . We hoped Putin might establish the same . But no . As things stand , we have no government , no real courts , nothing . We call our government for help and get no answer . " What about the bloody crimes dominating Stalin 's rule ? " It 's better to serve in a battalion with discipline , right ? " he said . " Look , we 're half-Asiatic , half-European . We need to maintain our traditions , and for that we need a strong leader . We need discipline . " From Kirensk to the Arctic I would hear Putin faulted , if at all , for not dealing harshly enough with his unruly populace . <p> IN A CLEARING on a spruce-covered mountainside , Vadim and I spotted a guard tower with a Soviet flag flying above it . Nearby , a 30-foot-high portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of socialist realism  --  glowered down at us from a two-story concrete barracks . A young man with a shaved head , wearing a blue prison uniform , came running down the bank toward us , waving . He shook our hands and welcomed us to Zolotoy , a correctional labor settlement . Out from the barracks marched a line of ten inmates , tanned and healthy-looking . " Oh , roll call ! " he exclaimed , and trotted off to join them . <p> An officer in khaki emerged from a cabin , peered at us through binoculars and motioned to us to approach . He ran the camp , he said , and the inmates served their sentences logging in the forests . " They do n't look very dangerous , " I said . " Are they petty criminals ? " <p> " Oh , they all robbed someone or beat up people , " he said . " They 're here for a good reason . " <p> Zolotoy , he said , had once been a logging settlement , but the saw mill had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly pensioners , lived in the derelict huts up on the bank . The inmates helped the villagers with chores . What about the Soviet flag ? I asked . " Excuse me , but what 's wrong with the Soviet flag ? " the officer said . " It 's always pleasant to see it . It reminds of how things were before all that crap with perestroika began and killed this village . " As we walked back to the boat , he talked disdainfully about political reforms , yet spoke of the beauty of being posted out in these wilds . He shook our hands and saw us off . <p> THE SAKHA REPUBLIC covers 1.86 million square miles-a harsh territory roughly equivalent in size to Western Europe  --  and accounts for a sixth of Russia 's landmass . Barely a million people live there . Forty percent of it lies within the Arctic Circle , and permafrost hinders agriculture and construction . Summers are brief but surprisingly hot : it can reach 105 degrees . Nowhere on earth do temperatures throughout the year vary so widely : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone live 36 species of fish , many of them Salmonidae , including the giant and elusive taimen , trout that reach six feet in length and can weigh more than 150 pounds . Vadim would catch , most of all , okun , lenok and succulent nelma , frying what we could eat the first day and smoking the rest in a blackened tin box he brought for that purpose . <p> As we journeyed into the heat of Sakha 's larch-and-alder lowlands , the fish grew more plentiful  --  and so did horseflies almost an inch long , with bulbous eyes and a quarter-inch-long proboscis . From our departure around ten in the morning till we pitched camp at eight in the evening , flies circled us relentlessly . Their stab was painful . Worse still were the midges  --  clouds of tiny gnats . Slapping at them left our arms and faces streaked with blood . These biting insects have played their role in Siberia 's history , deterring escapees from the gulags . " In Old Russia , " Vadim said , " people were put to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bugs would suck all the blood out of them . " <p> Sakha 's 700,000 rivers and streams and 708,000 lakes ensure no scarcity of breeding grounds for the pests . We chose our campsites carefully . The rare spot of grassy shore meant mosquitoes ( of which I counted three varieties ) ; the commoner pebbly banks , midges . Larch and birch forests sheltered an abundance of man-eaters , whereas pine groves , scented with tangy sap , seemed anathema to all manner of insects . I found the only sure way to escape bites was to stand in the acrid plume of campfire smoke , red-eyed and coughing ; Vadim did n't shave or bathe . " The Yakuts of the taiga do n't bathe , " he said . " Traditional peoples know that skin with clogged pores does n't attract bugs . " <p> Some 700 miles and three weeks out of Ust-Kut , with temperatures falling , we pulled up to Nyuya , a tidy village on a sandy bank . The villagers ' square jaws and long faces suggest something other than Slavic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Siberian style ( squat and of dark larch ) , sported windows of polished glass hung with bright yellow-and-green curtains . No trash littered the dirt lanes . In fact , Germans built most of Nyuya after the Stalin regime exiled them in 1941 from their homeland along the Volga , the German Autonomous Republic , an ethnic entity established during the early Soviet years . <p> I sipped tea in the kitchen of Sophia and Jakob Deisling , who were in their mid-70s . Their cheerful daughter Anna served tomatoes and cucumbers from their garden . Sophia recalled how , in 1941 , Soviet troops loaded her and everyone else in her village in the Volga aboard cattle trains . Thus began a yearlong odyssey that took them through Kazakhstan to Ust-Kut and , by barge , up the Lena . The authorities conscripted her father and all the other young and middle-aged men into the Labor Army . Her mother fell ill , a brother died en route and a sister died of malnutrition . In September 1942 , the barge deposited the survivors at Nyuya ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were little girls and children and old people , " Sophia said . " How could we saw down trees ! But they told us to meet the timber quota or they 'd take away our rations-just 400 grams of bread a day ! " <p> Exiled Finns and Lithuanians soon joined them . They might all have perished had not a new director , named Kul , been assigned to oversee their labor ; he had the men do the heaviest labor to ease the exiles ' plight , Sophia says . She expressed gratitude for Kul and the Sakha government , which compensates Stalin 's victims with free electricity , firewood and a pension . " May God grant peace to those who called us fascists ! " she said , magnanimously , of her torturers . <p> The German Autonomous Republic was not restored alter World War II , and the exiles had to put heated sand ill their boots or lose their feet to frostbite , Jakob told me . Still , he seemed to hold no grudges . " Who could we attack ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following orders . We all worked together to fulfill the plan ! " He paused . " I have preserved my Catholic faith . I pray that God forgive Lenin and Stalin . I know this : I ca n't enter heaven with enmity in my heart . We must forgive those who harm us . " As the Russian national anthem came on the radio , his eyes filled with tears . <p> TO PART WITH all notions of freedom , hope , control over one 's destiny  --  that is nullifying . After returning from such encounters , I tried to share my incredulity with Vadim . He answered with venom . Russians were a " herd " that could " only be ruled by force , " he would say , and Stalin had largely got it right . " I 'm more worried about how we 're killing off our wildlife than about how people suffer , " he told me . " As long as the government does n't bother me , I really do n't care . " <p> Once we passed Olekminsk and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a swift stream 400 or 500 yards wide into an island-studded watercourse five or six miles across , littered with shoals on which we ran aground . Rainstorms arose suddenly . For five long days I bailed as Vadim , wrapped grimly in his poncho , swung us left and right between angry foaming swells . <p> The taiga shrank from majestic and dense to sparse and runty , prefiguring the desolating spread of tundra . Yard-high sand dunes appeared on the shore , lending parts of the riverscape a bizarre Saharan aspect . The soothing , bi-tonal ha-hoo ! of the cuckoo bird all but vanished ; the Siberian chipmunks dwindled in number , and so did the hawks that hunted them . If once a brown bear had come grunting to our camp at dawn to tear up an anthill , and a golden-furred Arctic fox , ears perked , had watched us pack our boat , now our only regular companions were the lonely Sabine gull or croaking raven or cheeping sandpiper . The constant light , at two in the morning as bright as an overcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed the changes . The sun no longer burned , and frequent cold snaps put the mosquitoes out of commission for hours at a stretch . We were sailing through Vadim 's North , and I found it mournfully enchanting . <p> Almost a month after leaving Ust-Kut , and some 300 miles from the Arctic Circle , we spotted dock cranes , nine-story apartment buildings , ancient log cabins sinking into the permafrost  --  this was Yakutsk , capital of Sakha , home to 200,000 people . The Turkic Yakuts , who migrated to Sakha from Central Asia in the 12th century , number only about 320,000  --  tiny numbers indeed , given the areas vastness , but Russia has always suffered from underpopulation . <p> My Yakut guide , a 20-something schoolteacher named Tatiana Osipova , was light-complexioned , with narrow eyes and a languid air . She was anything but languid , however . She took me to the National Art Museum of the Sakha Republic , where a Yakut painter , Timofey Stepanov , was exhibiting his work , all of it awash with canary yellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods and mythical beasts , princesses and knights on stout horses  --  figures from the Yakurs ' shamanistic religion , Ayi . His renditions recalled illustrations for children 's books  --  fantastic and lurid and unbelievable . " Our scenery is so gray , but here you see how much color we have inside us , " Tatiana said . <p> The atheism taught in Soviet times is still more common than faith , professions of which , in my experience , usually stemmed from other convictions , like nationalism . As it did with her . " We 're one of the most educated minorities in Russia , " she went on . " We take top prizes in national scholastic competitions . Not bad for a people that until just recently lived in balagany , " or crude log dwellings . " We protest on the streets in minus 50 degree weather when Moscow tries to take away our rights . We 're not some people at the end of the earth . We 've showed the world who we are , and we want our sovereignty And faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the basis of our character . Our national struggle continues ! " From Tatiana I heard spirited complaints about Kremlin policies for the first time on my trip . It would also be the last . <p> WE SAILED OUT OF Yakursk into merciless wilds . To the west spread the Central Yakutian Plain , an infinity of low , silver-green alders and sandy bog ; along the eastern bank , the snow-dappled Verkhoyansk Mountains reigned over scraggly taiga ; above choppy waters to the north churned gunmetal clouds and whirling skeins of fog . The temperature dropped into the 30s , and a cold head wind raised the surf on a river now nine or ten miles across . Day after day , for ten hours at a stretch , we crashed through breakers that at times forced us ashore . When it seemed nothing could get worse , the clouds emptied their burdens of frigid rain . <p> Vadim kept his cold blue eyes locked on the horizon . Landing , we would jump out and struggle to haul the boat ashore . Vadim would grab his bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Drink a drop , quick ! To warm up ! " I did , and it worked . We then would set up camp . Possibly trying to console me , Vadim said that this summer was freakishly cold . We had feasted on red and black currants before Yakutsk and expected to find them here , along with mushrooms , but there were none  --  grave omens . " It will be a hungry year , " Vadim pronounced . " Many animals will starve . There will be a lot of shatuny , " or bears that , having failed to eat enough to hibernate , wander the winter woods , at times attacking villagers . <p> Only a lone soaring black-headed Brent goose or occasional raven broke our sense of solitude . It was late July , and the latch 's tufty leaves were yellowing . <p> ON AUGUST 1 , we crossed the Arctic Circle . Hours later we spotted Zhigansk  --  a crescent of gray ; wind-battered shacks on a high curving bank . The next evening I found myself shockingly comfortable , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 3,500 people , mostly Yakuts and Evenks . With high cheeks and intelligent eyes , Shamayev , dressed in loafers , a wool sweater and pressed chinos , looked like he might have been pledging a conservative fraternity in the United States . He lived in what from the outside looked like a condemnable concrete hovel , but inside it was warm and clean , with a refrigerator , a Japanese television and polished wood furniture . His wife made us cucumber and tomato salad seasoned with sour cream , and spread out sausage and salted fish for our delectation . We sipped beer , a luxury . <p> In the name of their sovereigns , armed Cossack bands had ruthlessly exploited the Sakha region , collecting the fur tax but also demanding " gifts " for themselves  --  as much as five times the number of furs the state required  --  or taking women hostage if their men could n't or would n't pay . Russian merchants scoured the land for mammoth tusks ; in 1821 alone , one merchant exported 20,000 tons . The Soviets forced the semi-nomadic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and undermined their survival skills . <p> " Our mentality is Soviet , " Shamayev says . " Since we live in extreme conditions-just look at the black rings under people 's eyes here , which are scars from frostbite  --  we expect the state to help us and give us privileges . But there are too many incentives "  --  educational institutes , high technology , and the like , available through Moscow , for the Sakha Republic to want out of Russia . " Our patriotism is left over from Soviet days , and keeps us together . " <p> I told him I had heard otherwise on previous trips to Sakha . " OK , ten years ago we wanted to separate , but not now . We 're a strategically vital region of Russia . We have too many diamonds , too much timber , coal , and even oil , for them to let us go . " He went on . " Even though we 're descended from Genghis Khan , we 're not a hotblooded mountain people like the Chechens , who love war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chechens . " <p> IN OUR LAST THREE WEEKS on the Lena , we forced our way through storm after storm , heading north toward Tiksi . Now the taiga gave way entirely to tundra , carpeted in lichen and moss ; stony mountains arose on both banks , overflown now and then by golden eagles . As we approached the delta , strong winds prompted us to stop at Tit-Ary , a nearly deserted village of gray shacks and wrecked fishing boats . <p> I spotted crosses atop a sandy hillock , a monument to Finns and Lithuanians interred there  --  more of Stalin 's victims . A plaque at the base of the tallest cross read : " TORN BY VIOLENCE FROM THEIR NATIVE LAND , FALLEN , BUT NOT FORGOTTEN . " The wind had blown away the sand to expose the coffins . There was something telling in their exposure . Here and there across Russia , monuments have been erected to the crimes of the Soviet era , but they are ill-tended and appear insignificant besides the poverty and neglect of the hinterland . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delta 's eastern banks , where mountains rose sheer and stony from the water 's edge , to enter the churning Laptev Sea . By then I had grown to admire Vadim . We had quarreled at times . But no matter how high the waves , he never slackened in spirit . He turned desolate riverbanks into comfortable campsites . Nikolai Nikitin , the prominent Russian historian , might have had him in mind when he described Siberia 's Cossack pioneers as " harsh , merciless , but always hardy , steadfast , and courageous , hesitating neither before the boundless Siberian expanses nor its inhospitable weather nor its thousand unknown but unavoidable dangers . " Vadim embodied the frontier spirit that allowed Russia to expand across 11 time zones and turned the country into a superpower ( if now only a former one ) . Vadim told me he admired strength and strongmen most of all  --  whether good or evil  --  and had no faith in democracy taking hold in his country His powerful presence reminded me that , ever since the Cossacks first ventured onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world had had to take notice . <p> SEVEN WEEKS after departing Ust-Kut , with snowcapped black mountains to the south and a gray sea roiling to the north , we saw , on a ridge , the boxy concrete barracks of Tiksi 's military base . A frigid rain began to fall . An hour later , we pulled up beneath a blue shack and a beached barge in Tiksi harbor . An army truck stood against the stormy sky , by the shack . We stepped onto the gravel shore and congratulated each other with a handshake . I felt strangely empty . Vadim disdained the comfort that Tiksi 's one hotel would offer and set up his tent onshore . I grabbed my pack and took out my permits , which the military in this closed settlement would surely want to see , and hiked up to the truck that would take me to Tiksi proper . <p> Like a vision from a gulag survivor 's nightmare , Tiksi 's wind-battered tenements and lopsided larch huts stood bleak and lonely under a bank of fog . Slogans painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE OUR FUTURE ! BLOOM , MY BELOVED YAKUTIA ! ) covered the weatherworn facades of the hilly center , reminding me that this town of a few thousand souls , mostly Russian military and state functionaries , used to be a bustling Soviet port , as well as one of the USSR 's most secretive places . Tiksi 's population  --  about 12,000 in Soviet times  --  enjoyed high pay and privileges for tours of duty that included two months of polar night and 120 days of gale-force winds a year . Now most of the remaining 6,000 or so Tiksians seem stranded . <p> I and my two hosts , Tamara ( a manager at Tiksi 's port ) and Olga ( a sailor and cook ) , went to the settlement 's one bar-restaurant , an unmarked yellow shack . " What the hell do you want ? " shouted the doorwoman , a hefty troll with a bristly mop of peroxided hair . " Why did n't you let us know in advance you were coming ! " <p> " Is that any way to treat customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your breath and slop manure on us instead ! " <p> " Yeah ! " chimed in Tamara . " We do n't have to patronize your establishment ! " <p> " Then do n't ! " The troll slammed the door . <p> In fact , we had no choice , so we forced our way in , and mounted the stairs to a cavernous bar . The troll flicked on red , green and white Christmas lights strung around the walls . A glum aproned barwoman took our orders . Tamara and Olga spoke of their glorious Soviet past . " We felt like such pioneers out here ! The state used to supply us with only the priciest delicacies ! " said Tamara . " We knew only luxury ! Our husbands used to fly to Moscow just to have a beer ! " <p> The bar filled with a somber crowd in jeans and black leather jackets : delicate Yakut women , pale and high cheekboned , and young men , Russians and Yakuts , mostly sloshed and stumbling . As I tucked into my steak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh wilderness receded from my consciousness , and I felt delivered . <p> A week later , Vadim and I boarded a plane for the flight to Moscow , six time zones back . We flew over mountainous tundra , then a carpet of forest laced with silver rivers . It would take us nine hours to fly across Siberia  --  terrain the Cossacks had annexed to Russia over the course of a century . For good or ill , their exploit affects us still . <p> MAP : The world 's tenth longest river , the Lena flows north some 2,700 miles through resource-rich eastern Siberia , where summer high temperatures and winter lows can differ by almost 200 degrees .
