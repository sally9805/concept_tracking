Who Is " Black " ? // " How difficult it sometimes is to know where the black begins and the white ends . " //  --  Booker T. Washington , Up from Slavery ( 1901 ) // Soon after declaring his candidacy for the presidency of the United States , Senator Barack Obama was asked on the television program 60 Minutes when he had " decided " that he was black. 1 One of the reasons the interviewer posed this question is that Obama 's mother was a white American and his father a black Kenyan . Obama , moreover , had had little contact with his father ; he was raised mainly in Hawaii by his mother and her relatives , in settings far afield from conventional black American communities. 2 Against this backdrop , some observers have questioned Obama 's racial standing . " Obama is n't black , " the journalist Debra J. Dickerson asserts , because " in our political and social reality black means those descended from West African slaves . " Rather , Dickerson continues , " by virtue of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama is an American of African immigrant extraction. " 34 // Obama responded to the question on 60 Minutes by distancing himself from the idea that he had " decided " to be black . He focused on three other considerations : his appearance , the response of onlookers to his appearance , and his shared experience of those responses with others also perceived to be " black . " " If you look African American in this society , " he remarked , " you 're treated as an African American . " 5 In 1940 , W. E. B. DuBois quipped that " the black man is a person who must ride ' Jim Crow ' in Georgia . " 6 Obama updated that view , noting that when he tried to catch taxis , drivers were not confused about his race ; they all too often refused to pick him up for racially discriminatory reasons , just as they all too often sped by other " black " men . // Discussion of Obama 's racial identity is a highly publicized instance of a feature of American race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep historical roots . Many people believe that determining who is " black " is rather easy , a task simplified by the administration of the one-drop rule. 7 Under the one-drop rule , any discernible African ancestry stamps a person as " black . " A principal purpose of this doctrine was to address " the problem " of children born of interracial sex who would bear a mixture of physical markers inherited from ancestors situated on different sides of the race line . White supremacists hoped that by definitively categorizing as " African , " " black , " " Negro , " or " colored " anyone whose appearance signaled the presence of an African ancestor , the one-drop rule would protect white bloodlines . It mirrored and stoked Negrophobia by proclaiming that even the tiniest dab of Negro ancestry was sufficiently contaminating to make a person a " nigger . " Many white racists have believed what a character exclaims in Thomas Dixon 's novel The Leopard 's Spots  --  that " a single drop " of Negro blood " kinks the hair , flattens the nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect , and lights the fires of brutal passions . " 89 // Many champions of black advancement , however , have also become devotees of the one-drop rule ( bereft , of course , of its white supermacist intentions ) . In her richly detailed defense of the doctrine , Professor Christine B. Hickman writes : // The Devil fashioned the one-drop rule out of racism , malice , greed , lust and ignorance , but in so doing he also accomplished good : His rule created the African-American race as we know it today , and while this race had its origins in the peoples of three continents and its members can look very different from one another , over the centuries the Devil 's one-drop rule united this race as a people in the fight against slavery , segregation and racial injustice. 10 // The one-drop rule helped to funnel into one racial camp people who might otherwise have been splintered . It is because of the one-drop rule that some of the most significant leaders among African Americans are considered " black " or " Negro " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately of Frederick Douglass and W. E. B. DuBois . Long denounced as a method for protecting whites against the taint of Negro blood , the one-drop rule is now embraced by some devotees of black unity as a way of reinforcing solidarity and discouraging exit by " blacks " who might otherwise prefer to reinvent themselves racially . // Despite its evident significance , however , the one-drop rule has never been an unchallenged guide to racial definition. 11 For a long period , several states formally defined as " white " individuals with known " black " ancestors . Until early in the twentieth century , several states , including Florida , Georgia , and South Carolina , statutorily decreed that an individual was considered white so long as he or she did not have more than one-eighth Negro " blood . " In Virginia , until 1910 , a person could be deemed white as long as he or she did not have more than twenty-four percent Negro blood . Not until 1924 did the Old Dominion adopt the one-drop rule. 12 True , in many places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger mistreatment , regardless of one 's genealogy or the words of some arcane statute purporting to define racial status . Still , the assigning of racial identity by white authorities has occasioned far more controversy than is generally realized . // Just as some " whites " have adopted rules of racial identification at variance with the one-drop rule , so , too , have some " blacks . " Light-skinned descendants of interracial unions have at various times attempted to set themselves apart from those with darker hues . They have labeled themselves differently , for example , eschewing " black " or " Negro " in favor of " FMC "  --  " free men of color "  --  or similar formulations . They have created social organizations that resolutely excluded those deemed to be " too dark "  --  those darker than a light-brown paper bag or those in whose wrists one can not discern blue veins. 13 They have insisted upon marrying people who were as light as , or preferably lighter than , themselves . The one-drop rule lumps all " colored " people together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in appearance or ancestry . But some light-skinned people of color have rejected that formula and insisted upon distinguishing themselves from " real " Negroes. 14 Consider the case of William Ellison , who was born into slavery in 1790 in South Carolina . Allowed to purchase his freedom ( by a white man who may well have been his biological father ) , Ellison amassed a sizable fortune , bought and sold slaves , contributed funds to pro-slavery vigilantes , aided the Confederacy , and then , after the Civil War , supported the opponents of Reconstruction . Today many people would describe Ellison as " black " despite his obvious multiraciality . Yet Ellison " did not consider himself a black man but a man of color , a mulatto , a man neither black nor white , a brown man . " 15 // Between 1850 and 1920 , the United States Census demarcated a category for the " mulatto . " Enumerators were initially given virtually no guidance ; 16 they used their own judgment , mainly based on appearance , to determine who was " black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , census officials noted that the " mulatto " category included " quadroons , octoroons and all persons having any perceptible trace of African blood . " 17 In 1890 , officials supplemented the " white , " " black , " and " mulatto " categories with two new classifications that had previously been subsumed within the definition for mulatto . They admonished enumerators to : // " be particularly careful to distinguish between blacks , mulattoes , quadroons , and octoroons . The word " black " should be used to describe those persons who have three-fourths or more black blood ; " mulatto , " those persons who have three-eighths to five-eighths black blood ; " quadroon , " those persons who have one-fourth black blood ; and " octoroon , " those persons who have one-eighth or any trace of black blood . " 18 // At no point were enumerators provided with a methodology for extracting this information or discerning these differences . // The idea of the mulatto has been a gathering point for a wide variety of racial prejudices , fears , myths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been a tendency on the part of whites and blacks to favor mulattoes and other mixed-race colored people over plain " blacks . " This tendency has been fueled , in large part , by the logic of white supremacy : since whiteness has been perceived to be superior to blackness , lighter complexions have been accorded more prestige than darker ones . Hence the saying : " If you 're black , go back ; if you 're brown , stick around ; if you 're white , you 're alright . " 2021 // The baleful efflorescence of racist sentiments in the post-World War I era prompted the Census Bureau to simplify its stratification of the American pigmentocracy . After 1920 , the Bureau ceased enumerating mulattoes . It adopted the one-drop rule , declaring that persons of " mixed blood " would be " classified according to the nonwhite racial strain . . . A person of mixed white . . . and Negro . . . is classified as . . . a Negro . . . regardless of the amount of white blood he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Joel Williamson , " all Negroes did look alike . On the one side , there were simply Negroes , and on the other the melting pot was busy making everyone else , except Asians simply white . Obviously the Bureau was quite willing to add its strength to the effort to create a simply biracial America . " 23 // Although skin color is undoubtedly the most salient signal of racial identity in America , other actual or imagined bodily features have also been seen as distinctive markers of Negritude . These include the shapes of heads , feet , lips , and noses as well as the texture of hair. 24 Adjudicating the race of plaintiffs suing for their freedom , a Virginia judge asserted in 1806 that : // " Nature has stamped upon the African and his descendants two characteristic marks , besides the difference of complexion , which often remain visible long after the characteristic distinction of color either disappears or becomes doubtful ; a flat nose and a wooly head of hair . The latter of these characteristics disappears the last of all ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this latter character , that it predominates uniformly where the party is in equal degree descended from parents of different complexions . " 25 // Yet , the very words used as labels for races  --  " white , " " black , " " red , " " yellow , " and " brown "  --  highlight the centrality of complexion in American racial consciousness . Skin color has long been the main physiological feature of the uniform that is widely seen as racially identifying the wearer . // So long as procreation stems from parents of the same race , appearance and lineage are typically congruent . Interracial unions give rise to added complexity . Interracial amalgamation will produce some individuals whose features diverge from those commonly ascribed to the races of their ancestors . When conflict arises between looks and lineage , it is the former that usually emerges as the more influential of the two . As Professor Robert Westley observes , " no one who is visually apprehended as Black . . . turns out to be white . . . . The judgment of Blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable instances whites have been willing to grant what Professor Daniel Sharfstein terms " racial amnesty " to individuals who appeared to be white. 27 The key to such amnesty , however , has been the appearance of the individuals in question ; if they looked obviously " colored " there has been no controversy . They are labeled " colored " or " black " or " Negro " and that is the end of it . Only if they possessed physical traits that might lead them to be seen as white ( or something else nonblack ) would space be opened allowing for wiggle room in determining their racial placement . // Consider the early nineteenth-century North Carolina case Gobu v. Gobu , 28 in which a white girl found an abandoned baby whom she claimed as her slave . When this enslaved boy grew to maturity he sued for his freedom . No one knew the identity of his biological parents . In appearance , according to the court , he was " of an olive colour , between black and yellow , had long hair and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if he had recognized the plaintiff as " black , " the plaintiff would have borne the burden of proving that he was not a slave . In Judge Taylor 's words : " I acquiesce in the . . . presumption of every black person being a slave . " But the plaintiff was not " black " ; he was of " mixed blood , " meaning that his mother might have been white or an Indian. 29 Given these possibilities , and the absence of any other pertinent evidence , the judge required the slaveholder to bear the burden of proving that the plaintiff was properly enslaved . The judge decided , in short , to give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt  --  a benefit withheld from anyone deemed by appearance to be " black . " // Neither appearance nor lineage nor the concatenation of the two exhaust the menu of ingredients that have figured into determinations of race . Consider the lawsuit in South Carolina in 1940 in which Virginia Bennett challenged the will of her deceased father , Franklin Capers Bennett. 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire estate to his second wife , Louetta Chassereau Bennett . Virginia attacked the validity of Louetta 's marriage to Franklin , asserting among other things that the union had violated the state 's antimiscegenation law . According to Virginia , Louetta was colored , inasmuch as she was more than one-eighth Negro , and was thus prohibited from marrying Franklin , a white man . Virginia 's motivation was clear . She wanted to obtain portions of Franklin 's estate that would be lost to her if her father 's marriage to Louetta was upheld. 31 // The Supreme Court of South Carolina rejected Virginia 's challenge . It ruled that Louetta was not a Negro , despite the presence of " some Negro blood in her veins , " because she possessed a reputation as a white person  --  in the court 's words , she had been " generally accepted as white "  --  and because she had long " acted white , " by doing such things as marrying a white man , attending a white church , sending her children to white schools , and voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling in favor of Louetta Bennett , despite her " negro blood , " was firmly rooted in precedent . As far back as 1835 , the South Carolina judiciary had weighed considerations other than complexion and lineage in determining racial identification . " We can not say what admixture of negro blood will make a colored person , " Judge William Harper declared . " The condition of the individual is not to be determined solely by a distinct and visible mixture of negro blood , but by reputation , by his reception into society , and by his having commonly experienced the privileges of a white man . " 33 // In the process by which individuals are racialized , they have little or no control over certain factors  --  the color of their skin , the identity of their ancestors , the judgments of others , the ascendant protocols of racial categorization . Barack Obama , for instance , has no control over one of the most significant aspects of his case : the fact that some American-born Negroes decline to acknowledge as " African American " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valerie Smith notes that " Obama 's ' black credentials ' have been questioned as much because of his Kenyan father as his white mother . " 34 Those who have raised questions on this score emphasize the centrality of slavery in America to their definition of " blackness " : to them , a " black " must have an ancestral tie to enslavement in America  --  clearly a circumstance over which an individual today has no control . // NOTES // 1 See **33;324;TOOLONG minutes . // 2 See Barack Obama , Dreams from My Father : A Story of Race and Inheritance ( 1995 , 2004 ) ; Michael Barone and Richard E.
