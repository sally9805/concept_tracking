When it was first discovered , scientists dubbed peptide YY3-36 ( PYY ) the fullness hormone . That 's because PYY  --  a protein produced by the gut  --  functions as a powerful appetite suppressant , at least in thin people . But would it work for those who need it most , the overweight and obese ? <P> The answer , according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine , is yes . When 24 volunteers were injected with PYY or a placebo and set loose on a buffet lunch , all the subjects who got PYY  --  fat and thin  --  packed away a third fewer calories . The same study revealed that obese people make a third less PYY than their thinner counterparts . No wonder they overeat ! <P> But even if you could buy PYY in pill form , it might not work . The appetite is a complex system with many subtle triggers and controls . Remember leptin , the wonder hormone that seemed to make mice thin ?
