When the average Japanese salaryman heads home each evening , you can bet the last song he wants to hear from his car radio or earphones is his company 's anthem , or shaka , the corporate tune that employees are forced to sing at year-end parties and sometimes even during morning calisthenics in the factory yard . Pity , therefore , the workers of Yokohama-based Nihon Break Kogyo . After its anthem was played on a popular midnight variety show , Asahi TV 's Tamori Club , so many listeners responded with requests for copies that the company decided to release the song as a single . It debuted last week at No. 22 on Oricon 's weekly Top 30 singles list . The lyrics seem ideally suited for Japan 's trendy club scene : " We will destroy houses ! /We will destroy bridges ! /We will destroy buildings ! /To the East ! To the West ! " A corporate example of postpunk nihilism ? No , Nihon Break Kogyo is a demolition company . <P>  --  By Anthony Spaeth      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
