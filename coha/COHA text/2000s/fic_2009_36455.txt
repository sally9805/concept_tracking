I 'm not sure where one should expect to find the bereaved daughter of a wealthy Malibu suicide in need of a trauma cleaner long after midnight , but safe to say a trucker motel down the 405 industrial corridor in Carson was not on my list of likely locales. <br>  --  Ouch . That looks painful . <br> I touched the bandage on my forehead . <br>  --  And if that 's what it feels like to look at it , imagine how it feels to actually have it happen to you . <br> The half of her face that I could see in the chained gap at the edge of the door nodded . <br>  --  Yeah , I 'd imagine that sucks . <br> Cars whipped past on the highway across the parking lot , taking full advantage of the few hours in any given Los Angeles county twenty-four hour period when you might get the needle on the high side of sixty . I watched a couple of them attempting to set a new land speed record . I looked back at Soledad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <br>  --  Uh huh ? <br> I hefted the plastic carrier full of cleaning supplies I 'd brought from the van . <br>  --  Someone called for maid service ? <br>  --  Yeah . That was me. <br>  --  I know . <br> She fingered the slack in the door chain , set it swinging back and forth . <br>  --  I did n't really think you 'd come . <br>  --  Well , I like to surprise . <br> She stopped playing with the chain . <br>  --  Terrible habit . Do n't you know most people do n't like surprises ? <br> I looked over at the highway and watched a couple more cars . <br>  --  Can I ask a silly question ? <br>  --  Sure . <br> I looked back at her . <br>  --  What the fuck am I doing here ? <br> She ran a hand through her hair , let it fall back over her forehead . <br>  --  You sure you want to do this , Web ? <br> That being the kind of question that tips most people off to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as my cue to go downstairs , get back in the van and get the hell gone . But it 's not like I had n't already been clued to things being fucked up when she called in the middle of the night and asked me to come to a motel to clean a room . And there I was anyway . So who was I fooling ? <br> Exactly no one . <br>  --  Just let me in and show me the problem . <br>  --  Think you can fix it , do you ? <br> I shook my head . <br>  --  No , probably not . But it 's cold out here . And I came all this way . She showed me half her smile , the other half hidden behind the door . <br>  --  And you 're still clinging to some hope that a girl asking you to come clean something is some kind of booty call code , right ? <br> I rubbed the top of my head . But I did n't say anything . Not feeling like saying no and lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be time for that kind of thing later . There 's always time for lying . <br> She inhaled , let it out slow . <br>  --  OK . <br> The door closed . I heard the chain unhook . The door opened and I walked in , my feet crunching on something hard . <br>  --  This the asshole ? <br> I looked at the young dude standing at the bathroom door with a meticulously crafted fauxhawk . I looked at bleached teeth and handcrafted tan . I looked at the bloodstains on his designer-distressed jeans and his artfully faded reproduction Rolling Stones concert T from a show that took place well before he was conceived . Then I looked at much larger bloodstains on the sheets of the queen-size bed and the flecks of blood spattered on the wall . I looked at the floor to see what I 'd crushed underfoot , half expecting cockroaches , and found dozens of scattered almonds instead . I listened as the door closed behind me and locked . I watched as Soledad walked toward the bathroom and the dude snagged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked , Is this the asshole . <br> I pointed at myself . <br>  --  Honestly , in most circumstances , in any given room on any given day , I 'd say , Yeah , I 'm the asshole here . But in this particular scenario , and I know we just met and all , but in this room here ? <br> I pointed at him . <br>  --  I 'm more than willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and say that you 're the asshole . <br> He looked at Soledad. <br>  --  So , yeah , he 's the asshole then ? <br> She twisted her hand free and went into the bathroom . <br>  --  He 's the guy I told you about . <br> She closed the door behind her . <br> He looked at me. <br>  --  Yeah , you 're the asshole alright . <br> I held up a hand . <br>  --  Hey , look , if you 're gon na insist , I can only accept the title . But seriously , do n't sell yourself short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it . He came down the room in a loose strut I imagine had been meticulously <br> assembled from endless repeat viewings of Tom Cruise 's greatest hits . <br>  --  Yeah , I can tell by the way you 're talking . You 're the one fucked with her today . Made jokes about her dad killing himself . You 're the asshole alright . The toilet flushed , Soledad yelled over it . <br>  --  He did n't make jokes ! <br> The dude looked at the closed door . <br>  --  You said he made jokes . <br> He looked at me. <br>  --  Asshole . Fucking go in someone 's home , there 's been a tragedy , go in and try to make money off that . Fucking vulture . Fucking ghoul . Who does that , who comes up with that for a job ? That your dream job , man ? Cleaning up dead people ? Other kids were hoping to grow up to be movie stars and you were having fantasies about scooping people 's guts off the floor ? <br> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth is , mostly I had fantasies about doing your mom . <br> He slipped a lozenge of perforated steel from his back pocket , flicked his wrist and thumb in an elaborate show of coordination , and displayed the open butterfly knife resting on his palm . <br>  --  Say what , asshole ? <br> Say nothing , actually . Except say that maybe he was right and I was the asshole in the room . Certainly being an asshole was how I came to be there in the first place . <br> Continues ...
