Raising the Dead for Fun and Profit <p> Nowadays , anyone with a wallet full of cash and a little insider knowledge is getting into the Supernatural life . And , I do mean anyone . Criminals , politicians , even-brace yourself-entertainers are plopping down tons of cash for immortality . - Supernatural Seattle ( June 2008 ) <p> Gil brought lawn chairs to the cemetery-not stylish Adirondacks , not even semi-comfortable camp chairs ( the ones with those handy little cup holders ) . No . He dug up some cheap plastic folding chairs , the kind that burrow into your leg flesh like leeches . He arranged them in a perfect semicircle around a freshly sodded grave , planted an iBoom stereo in the soft earth , pulled out a bottle of ' 07 Rose McGowan , and drained half of it before his ass hit plastic . Granted , he managed these mundane tasks in a pricey Gucci tuxedo , the tie loose and dangling . On any other day , this would have been his sexy vamp look , but tonight ... not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked exhausted . <p> I , on the other hand , looked stunning . <p> One of those movie moons , fat and bloated as a late-night salt binge , striped the graveyard with tree branch shadows , and spotlit your favorite zombie heroine reclining starlet-like on the polished marble of the new tombstone-there was no way I was subjecting vintage Galliano to the inquisition of plastic lawn chairs ; the creases would be unmanageable . <p> Wendy did n't take issue with the cheap and potentially damaging seating . She wore a tight pink cashmere cardigan over a high-waisted chestnut skirt that hit her well above the knee . She crossed her legs and popped her ankle like a 1950s housewife , each swivel bringing attention to her gorgeous peek-toe stilettos-certainly not the most practical shoe for late-night graveyard roaming , but who am I to judge ? <p> The dearly departed were our only other company ; about twenty or so ghosts circled the grave-in a rainbow of moody colors and sizes . A little boy spirit , dressed in his Sunday best and an aqua green aura , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the other , older specters muttered to each other , snickered and pointed . Popular opinion aside , zombies do not typically hang out in graveyards-ask the ghosts . We do n't crawl out of the ground all rotty and tongue-tied , either . We 're created through bite or breath , Wendy and I from the latter . So you wo n't see us shambling around like a couple of morons , unless there 's a shoe sale at Barney 's . <p> " You 're killin ' me with The Carpenters , ca n't you skip this one ? " I stretched for the iPod with my heel trying to manipulate its doughnut dial . Karen was bleating on about lost love from beyond the grave-and just a little to the left . " She 's forcing me to search my bag for a suicide implement . I swear I 'll do it . " <p> " No shit . Her warble is drawing the less-than-present out of the woodwork . " Wendy looked over the top of huge Chanel sunglasses-she seemed to wear them as a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more irritated with every second that passed . Such a simple pleasure , but those are often the best , do n't you find ? <p> " Bitches . " Gil opened an eye . " This is a classic . Besides , Markham put this playlist together . " <p> " Who 's that ? " I 'd decided against self-harm and opted for a smart cocktail . I pulled a mini shaker from my bag and followed that up with miniature bottles of vodka , gin , and rum . Who says Suicides are just for kids ? I mixed while Gil chattered . <p> " Him . " He jabbed a thumb toward the grave . " That 's Richard Markham ; they call him the Beaver King . He 's a millionaire , entrepreneur , and genuinely bad guy . He owns a chain of strip clubs , you might have heard of them . Bottoms . " <p> When neither of us registered a hint of recollection , he became animated . <p> " You know . He 's been in the news recently because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' All Bottomless Entertainment ' . " <p> " Do n't you mean ' all nude ' ? " Wendy asked . <p> " No . ' All Bottomless . ' He 's decidedly anti-boobs . His clubs feature blouses and beaver . It 's a very specialized niche . " <p> " Well then , this should be fun . " I stuck a straw into the shaker and sucked . <p> It was nice to see Gil 's enthusiasm ; he had been a complete ass-pipe since he 'd opened Luxury Resurrections Ltd. , stressing about every little detail . I had to hand it to the guy . After the money dried up-his sire left him a hefty sum in their bank account and then left ( said Gil was too needy ) - he launched his plan to charge humans for vamping . He was one of the first in Seattle , but the copycats were close on his heels . A few months later he bought into my condominium-not a penthouse like mine , but a pretty swank pad , nonetheless . <p> " Explain to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to separate her legs from the sweaty straps-I cringed , afraid that she 'd leave some meat on the plastic ; we were fresh out of skin patch-they finally released with a slow sucking sound . She massaged the pattern of dents on the backs of her legs . " It 's not like vampires need to rise from the actual grave . It 's a little melodramatic . Do n't ya think ? " <p> " Yeah . " I drained the final droplets from the shaker with loud staccato slurps . The alcohol seeped into my veins , flooding them with welcome warmth . <p> " I told you , I have to provide an experience with the Platinum package , " Gil huffed , then snatched up his man bag and dug through it . He pulled out some Chapstick , spread it on in a wide " O , " retrieved a crumpled brochure , and tossed it at me . " Here . Service is the only thing that 's going to set my business apart from the chain vampire manufacturers . I provide individualized boutique-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hmm . " I slid from the headstone , carefully hopscotched across the grave-I 'd hate to misstep and harpoon Gil 's client , or worse , break off a heel in the dirt-and stood next to Wendy . I smoothed the crinkled paper and turned to catch the moonlight . <p> " The Platinum Package , " I read aloud . " Includes pre-death luxury accommodations at the Hyatt Regency , voted by readers of Supernatural Seattle as the best undead-friendly hotel in the city , a thorough consultation with a vamping specialist , a fully realized death scenario , including funeral and interment , bereavement counseling for immediate family , and an exclusive orientation to the afterlife from the moment of rising . Hmm . " <p> " I spent a lot of time on that . " Gil beamed . <p> " Yeah , at least fifteen minutes . " My eyes found a series of numbers after the description , that if it were n't for the dollar sign , I 'd have mistaken for binary code . " Can I ask you a question ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price down here ? " I pointed out the figure . <p> " Yep . " <p> Wendy took a slug from a crystal-studded flask-she could n't find her usual Hello Kitty one . Immediately , her skin took on the rosy glow of most living alcoholics . I love the look : almost human . <p> " One million dollars , Gil ? You call that reasonable pricing ? " <p> Wendy did a spit take that flecked the brochure and my hands . " Jesus ! So , if that 's the platinum , what 's the bronze package , then ? " Wendy asked , wiping at the Grey Goose trickling from her nose . " A drive-by vamping ? " <p> " Cute . " Gil tongued and sucked at his fangs in irritation . <p> He shrugged off our outrage and plopped down in his own lawn chair . " Five hundred grand is the going rate nowadays , the markup is for my fabulous luxury features . It 's not cheap , but look what you get ... " He swept his hands from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... a super hot greeting party . And ... a couple of hot go-go dancers . " <p> " Where ? " I looked around . " Are they late ? " <p> " Why , you two pork chops , of course . You remembered to leave the panties at home , right ? " <p> " Oh yeah . Of course . " I plucked a miniature GoldschlSger from my purse and drained it . " When am I not airing out the chamber of horrors ? " <p> " Me , too , " Wendy said . " Totally commando . " <p> " Gross . " Gil covered his mouth , heaving . " Let 's not talk about the vage , anymore . I think I 'm traumatized . " <p> " You started it . " I tossed the empty bottle aside and dug for another . <p> From there , the conversation dwindled to nothing , an uncharacteristic silence settling over us like a late summer fog . The ghosts had even settled down . Except for a particularly downtrodden specter pacing under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various routines ( friendly visits to neighboring graves , a spirited game of cards over by the mausoleum , a display of ghost lights in the woods ) . Relaxing , even . <p> And that 's when I opened my big fat mouth . <p> " I got a weird call today . " <p> " Oh yeah ? " Wendy asked . She must have been bored because this normally mundane news had her wide-eyed . <p> " My mother 's hospice worker . " <p> " What ? " Gil twisted in his chair to face me . " Hospice ? She 's dying ? You never even talk about her . I thought she 'd already kicked it . " <p> " Yeah , right ? " Wendy muttered . <p> The dead are so sympathetic . If you 're looking for an honest opinion , and do n't want any handholding or softeners , this is the crowd for you . Not that we 're auditioning for friends , just now . <p> " Nope . She 's still alive . The doctors say she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much spread everywhere . Been at the hospice for a few weeks now . Apparently , it 's not pretty , nor is she . " Inside or out , I thought . " Wow . " <p> " That 's bad . " <p> " Yeah . " The truth was , I was n't feeling any pain about it . Ethel Ellen Frazier had been a rotten mother , wife , and human being . You name it . Now , she was rotting inside . Ironic ? Harsh ? Sure , but she 'd earned it . Every wince of pain , bout of vomiting , and bloody toilet bowl-the caller had gone into some unnecessary specifics . <p> Let me give you a little " for instance . " <p> When I was young , Ethel convinced me-through months of badgering and ridicule-that I could benefit from a gym membership . Dad tried to talk her out of it , but like always , he had no say . So , off we went to Happy 's Gym and Pool . Happy was just that ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to muster , broad and beaming . I think it was even real . The gym and pool were in the same room , a massive barn-like structure with the pool in the center , the equipment to the right , and the men 's and women 's locker rooms on the left , separated by a dry sauna . With about ten minutes left on the treadmill , I noticed a growing number of horrified expressions . I took off my headphones . Screams were coming from the sauna . Long screams . Then , choppy short bursts . And in between low gurgling moans reminiscent of the ape house at the zoo . <p> I scanned the room for my mother ; I did n't expect to see her . She was behind closed doors . And I was out in the open , 15 years old and humiliated . Happy 's smiling face was nowhere to be found , either . I suspected it was crammed firmly between my mother 's thighs . But I was wrong . The security guard cleared up the mystery by opening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and facing a captive audience , Happy behind her caught up inside like a shamed dog ; his perpetual smile replaced by an embarrassed " O " . I could see the words play across Ethel 's lips , as I ran for the exit . " Shut the door , dimwit ! " <p> Now , tell me she did n't buy herself some cancer on that day . <p> Did I mention how lucky I am to have friends like Wendy and Gil ? I can always count on them to turn the conversation back around to ... them , and I was glad to have the heat off this time . <p> " Oh my God ! " Wendy grabbed my arm and shook it like an impatient kid in the candy aisle . " I totally knew about this . I was talking to Madame Gloria just the other day and- " <p> " Here we go . " Gil snatched up the bottle of McGowan and finished it off . <p> Madame Gloria was Wendy 's telephone psychic . According to our girl , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shut up , Gil . Madame Gloria said that someone was going to die and that we ... " she pointed at Gil , herself , and me , " we would be going on a trip . A road trip . " <p> " Jesus . " I swatted her hand away . " You think she 's talking about Ethel ? I 'll be damned if I haul my dead ass across three states for that bag of bones . " <p> " It might be good to get some closure . " Gil 's face was attempting sincerity . It missed . He did succeed in pulling off a smoosh-faced version of constipated . <p> " Alright . So , before the two of you go all psychotherapist on me , let me tell you a few things . The reason I never talk about my mother is that she 's a bitch . In fact , the last time I saw her was my high school graduation , where she blew me off to go to my ex-best friend 's party . I ca n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . " None of that matters , anyway . Madame Gloria says we 're going . It 's fate . " <p> " Yeah . It 's fate . " A sly smile played on Gil 's lips . <p> " Like Hell it is . " I punched his arm . " What was all that shit about breaking free from your family ? " <p> He sneered , rubbing the spot . " What are you talking about ? " <p> " When I first met you and you took me to see Ricardo ? " <p> " Not ringing any bells . " <p> " Ricardo told me that I needed to make a clean break from any living family and friends . " <p> Ricardo Amandine had filled me in on a lot more than mere survival tactics . The club owner had become a mentor of sorts , doling out words of wisdom over drinks , shopping , and the odd kill . He was hot as hell , but as is the rule with male zombies , totally asexual . Shame . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . Your mother 's gon na die , anyway . And look at poor Wendy . Do n't her feelings count ? " He gestured to the other chair . <p> Wendy 's lips pursed into a pathetic pout . She was even batting her eyes . <p> Christ . <p> He continued . " She 's totally bored . Would a road trip be so bad ? " <p> I imagined dirty rest-stop bathrooms , rows of trailers substituting for motels , a general lack of shopping opportunities . A zombie has certain needs . The upside ? Cute country folk have cute country flavors . <p> Wendy nodded . " What were you planning to do about the situation ? " <p> " I thought I 'd pretend I 'd never gotten the call . Denial 's my friend , and all . " <p> " Yeah , okay . Just say you 'll think about it . Please ? " <p> " Fine . I 'll think about it . " <p> I lit up a cigarette ; the smoke caught on the thinnest of breezes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single ghost who was still interested in our presence . He stomped through the haze , passed us and then stopped about ten feet away , leaning against a rather confusing headstone of a gargoyle eating a hoagie-or was that a salmon ? <p> " I 've been meaning to talk to Hans about making me some of those , " Wendy said . She was pointing at the black-papered cigarette dangling from my lips . <p> " I 'll ask him to make you some . Any particular colors , or outfits you 're trying to match ? " <p> The ghost started coughing . Expansive rattling coughs . He must have wanted attention , as he never looked away . So dramatic . " It 's not gon na kill ya , buddy ! " I yelled . He scowled . <p> Wendy disregarded the exchange and continued . " An assortment would be great . Only no orange . I look horrible in orange . " <p> " Tell me about it . Remember that track jacket you kept trying to wear out in public . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to club you . " <p> " Oh yeah , " she said , as though I 'd brought up some long-lost treasure . " Where 'd I put that ? " <p> I shrugged . The truth was , Wendy had n't put the track jacket anywhere . I 'd snuck it out of her hall closet while mama was putting her face on and promptly dumped it in the trash chute . I was doing her a favor , really . She looked like a big pumpkin in that puffy satin piece of shit . <p> Gil adjusted his butt in the chair . He 'd taken note of our visitor . " Is that ghost eavesdropping ? " <p> " Probably . " <p> " I ca n't have anyone , or thing , fucking up my shit . Not tonight . Markham 's not a flexible guy . " <p> " Maybe he thinks you need a third judge of your vampire making- " <p> " Vampires ? " The ghost choked the words out from over my shoulder . I staggered to the side to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand me no friggin ' vampires . Piss on ' em . They should all rot in iron boxes . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
