Elaine 's , late . Stone Barrington finished his osso buco as Elaine wandered over from another table and sat down . " So ? " she asked . " So ? What kind of question is that ? " " It means , tell me everything . " Stone looked up to see Dino struggling to shut the front door behind him . Dino was his former partner , now a lieutenant , head of the detective squad at the 19th Precinct . Dino came over , sloughing off a heavy topcoat . " Jesus , " he said , hanging up his coat , muffler and hat . " There 's already six inches of snow out there , and there 's at least thirty knots of wind . " " How are we going to get home ? " Stone wondered aloud . " Do n't worry , my driver 's out there now , putting the chains on the car . " Dino now rated a car and driver from the NYPD . Stone shook his head . " Poor bastard . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss . " " What do you mean ? " Dino demanded , offended . " The kid 's getting an education working for me . They do n't teach this stuff at the academy . " " What , how to put chains on a lieutenant 's car ? " " All he has to do is watch me , and he learns . " Stone rolled his eyes , but let this pass . They drank their champagne in silence for a moment . " So ? " Dino asked , finally . " That 's what I just asked him , " Elaine said . " So , I 'm back . " Stone had returned from an extended stay in LA a few days before . " I knew that , " Dino said . " So ? " " Ca n't either of you speak in complete sentences ? " " So , " Dino said , " how 's Mrs. Barrington ? " " Dino , " Stone said , " if you 're going to start calling her that , I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Elaine said . " I 'm not surprised , " Stone replied . " Dino has a big mouth . " " So , how is she ? " Dino demanded . " I talked to Eduardo today , " Stone said . " Her shrink does n't want me to see her . Not for a while . " " That 's convenient , " Dino said . " You bet it is , " Stone agreed . " You feeling guilty , Stone ? " Elaine asked . " Sure he is , " Dino said . " If he had just taken my advice ... " " Mine , too , " Elaine echoed . " All right , all right , " Stone said . " If I had only taken your advice . " " Arrington is for you , " Elaine said . " Arrington is n't exactly speaking to me , " Stone said . " What does that mean ? " " It means that if I call her , she 's civil , but if I try to reason with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's the boy ? " Dino asked . " Peter 's fine . " " Does he know who his father is yet ? " " Look , Dino , I do n't know who his father is . It could just as well have been Vance as me . Not even Arrington knows . Nobody will , until we do the DNA testing . " " And when does that happen ? " " Arrington wo n't discuss it . " " Keep after her . " " I do n't know if it 's worth it , " Stone said wearily . " I 'm not sure it would make any difference . " " Give her time , " Dino said . " She 'll come around . " " You 're a font of wisdom , Dino . Know any other relationship clichs ? " " Every eligible man in the country is going to be after her , " Elaine said . " What ? " Stone asked . " She 's Vance Calder 's widow , dummy , and as such , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd better get your ass down to Virginia and win her back . " " She knows where to find me , " Stone said . Elaine rolled her eyes . Another blast of frigid air blew into the room as the front door opened again . " It 's your pal Eggers , " Dino said , nodding toward the door . Bill Eggers came over to the table . He did n't unbutton his coat . " Hi , Elaine , hi , Dino , " he said , then he turned to Stone . " I 've been calling you all evening . I should have known I 'd find you here . " Bill Eggers was the managing partner of Woodman &; Weld , the extremely prestigious law firm with which Stone was associated , in a very quiet way . " My home away from home , " Stone said . " What 's up ? " " I 've got a client in the car that you have to see tomorrow morning . " " Bring him in . I 'll buy him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Who is he ? " " No names , for the moment . " " You have secrets from us , Bill ? " Elaine asked . " You bet I do , " Eggers replied . " Ten o'clock sharp , Stone ? " " Ten o'clock is fine ; sharp depends on the snow . Your office ? " " Penthouse One , at the Four Seasons . He does n't want to be seen with you . " " Tell him to go fuck himself , " Stone said . " Stone , " Eggers said , " get this thing done and get it done right , and you could end up a rich man . " " Ten o'clock , sharp , " Stone said .
