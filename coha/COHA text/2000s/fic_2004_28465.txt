Chapter One " WE 'VE FOUND HER . " Mitch Barnes tightened his hold on the cell phone . " Where ? " " Here in San Antonio . " That surprised him . He figured she 'd be long gone by now . Taking in a slow , steadying breath , he left the kitchen to look at Hope , asleep in her crib . " What now ? " On the other end , Lily hesitated . " I was going to ask you that . " " Right . " Mitch closed his eyes and rubbed the back of his neck . It had been a few months since he 'd hired Lily Garrett Bishop and her brother Dylan of Finders Keepers to locate Terry Monteverde . You 'd think he 'd be prepared to face her by now . " Where did you find her ? " " She 's working at the Menger Hotel . " " Working ? " Mitch frowned . " Doing what ? " " She 's a maid . " Terry , heiress to All That Glitters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's - " " I 'm sure . And , Mitch ... " Lily cleared her throat . " I think you 're right . I got a good look at her . She 's got to be Hope 's mother . " His gut tightened as he stared at his sleeping daughter . At eight months , her lashes were already thick and black , lying against soft olive-skinned cheeks . She was a real beauty . Apparently just like her mother . Mitch tried not to wonder about what Terry looked like . Bad enough he could still remember that miraculous nightin Rio , the way her silky chestnut hair had lain across his bare chest , the wicked things she 'd done with her feather mask . But this was n't about him . If it were , he would n't have bothered trying to find her . But he figured his daughter had the right to know why she 'd been abandoned . He could n't tear his gaze away from Hope , still amazed at how much the child had become a major part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea what she 'd given up . Even if she did , it was too late . Hope was his now . " Mitch ? " " Yeah , Lily . I 'm here . " Weary suddenly , he scrubbed at his face . " Hope 's nanny is out for another half hour . Can we meet once Margaret gets back ? " " Sure . Want me to pick you up ? " " No , I 'll meet you in the parking lot of the Menger . " " Okay , " she said slowly . " You know , Mitch , I doubt Terry is going anywhere . Maybe you ought to wait until tomorrow and think about how you 'd like to approach her . " He wanted to laugh . As if he 'd been able to think about anything else . Especially after screwing up his Achilles tendon and having to sit on his ass these past few months . The FBI had had no use for an agent who could barely hobble . And a man could do a hell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nothing 's going to change between now and tomorrow . I do n't need you to come along if - " " I 'll be there . Let 's touch base again when Margaret gets home . " Mitch was about to agree when he heard a noise at the door . " Hold on , I think that might be her now . " He pulled Hope 's door partially closed as he walked toward the foyer , pleased that he barely limped anymore . Margaret was already crossing the threshold when he got there . Her windblown hair frizzed around her shiny flushed face , and her arms were loaded down with two large grocery sacks . She smiled as soon as she saw him . " Oh , Mr. Barnes , would you mind getting the door ? " " Let me call you back , " he told Lily , then disconnected and stuck his cell in his pocket . " I 'm sorry . I did n't know you were on the phone . " " No problem . How about I take these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her . It was n't very heavy but she was a small woman with barely enough meat on her bones . " Thank you , " she said , passing him the second bag , and blushing all the way to her hairline when he accidentally brushed the side of her breast . He started to murmur an apology , but figured that would just make it worse . According to her rsum , she was in her early thirties but she seemed much older . Probably because she was so conservative , kind of old-fashioned . But he 'd been damn lucky to find Margaret . She 'd been the first person the agency sent over , and he knew immediately she was the one . Efficient and always pleasant , she treated Hope as though she were her own child . She 'd also been an enormous help in getting them settled in the new home he 'd bought . If she had a fault , it was that she spent too much time fussing over him and Hope instead of enjoying a social life . Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it . " Look , I 've got to run out for a while . " He deposited the sacks on the kitchen counter . " I 'm not sure how long I 'll be , but if you have to leave - " " Do n't worry . " Margaret waved a dismissive hand . " I have no plans this evening . I 'll stay as long as you like . " " Thanks . " He smiled , and she blushed again . " Want help unloading the groceries ? " " Well ... " She shook her head , but her tone was n't exactly convincing . " No , go ahead . You have other things to do . " He was n't about to argue . He was so damn distracted with the knowledge he 'd be seeing Terry again , he could n't think about much else . " I have to make a quick call , and then I 'll be leaving . " Her brows arched with curiosity , then she looked away . But not before he caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make dinner ? " " No . " He headed toward the privacy of his study , already distracted again . " Thanks . Order something delivered if you want . There 's cash in the junk drawer . " " Fine . " At the shortness in her tone , he glanced back , but she was busy unloading the grocery sacks . It was n't like her to be abrupt , but he had too much on his mind to worry about it . Hell , everyone was entitled to a bad day . Lily answered on the second ring , and they agreed to meet in the hotel parking lot in half an hour . That gave him an extra five minutes to sit and think . As if he did n't have enough time to do that these days . It was n't that he regretted his decision to leave the Bureau . He 'd been a good agent , and through the FBI he 'd finally figured out what kind of man he was - one he 'd become pretty damn proud of .
