Who made Iowa so important , anyway ? Four years ago , the ambitious Governor of another small state dismissed Iowa and its clumsy caucuses as a waste of time . " If you look at the caucuses system , they are dominated by the special interests in both parties , and the special interests do n't represent the centrist tendencies of the American people , " Vermont 's then governor Howard Dean said on an obscure Canadian public-affairs program . The caucuses can stretch on all night , Dean noted , and he expressed wonderment that average people would even bother with them : " I ca n't stand there and listen to everyone else 's opinion for eight hours about how to fix the world . " <P> But he did , and Iowa returned the favor . Since making those comments  --  unearthed last week by NBC News ( part of a mountain of Dean 's earlier television appearances that the Bush-Cheney campaign has also been poring over )  --  Dean has been one of Iowa 's most frequent visitors . He has made 103 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caucuses was true  --  and still is  --  but as it turns out , some of those very characteristics proved the making of Howard Dean . In his unlikely transition from underfunded obscurity to the front of the Democratic pack , Iowa was where he found both his voice and his rationale for running . To paraphrase Yogi Berra , Dean discovered you can hear a lot just by listening . He had planned to run on a high-fiber policy diet of health care , early-childhood education and fiscal discipline , he recently told TIME . But in Iowa he learned something about voters that had not yet popped up on the national radar . " There was an intensity and kind of feeling by ordinary Americans that their government did n't care about them , did n't value them , and their employers did n't value them , " Dean recalls . " It was n't anger , though . It was despair . It was feeling loss of value  --  and it was in Iowa , and Iowa 's not an angry place . " <P> Dean  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time they have spent in Ottumwa and Council Bluffs and Davenport and Fort Dodge has paid off . Iowa 's first-in-the-nation contest is only a week away , and most polls show Dean holding a narrow lead over Congressman Dick Gephardt , who won the caucuses in 1988 and whose candidacy will be all but finished if he does n't eke out another victory this time . Gephardt is drawing most of his support from older , less affluent Iowans , Dean from upscale , educated and more socially liberal voters . The choice reflects the generational struggle within the party , and it 's a test of whether the new voters Dean claims to have recruited will be enough to overcome the forces that have dominated the caucuses . There is even a fight to be the best also-ran , with a spirited battle for third place being waged by Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina . Though no one really trusts the predictions , turnout is expected to be double the 61,000 who braved the winter chill to vote in the 2000 caucuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters  --  13% , in a KCI-TV poll last week  --  are still undecided . Once again Iowa is proving to be an unpredictable crucible , molding and remolding candidates and their messages in a state with a population smaller than metropolitan Cleveland .
