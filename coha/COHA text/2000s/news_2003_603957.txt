<p> The line on Olympic gold medalist Sarah Hughes is that she 's just so normal . She shares elbowroom at the breakfast table and bathroom time with five siblings . She takes classes at a public high school . <p> Yet nothing about her come-from-way-behind victory in the Salt Lake City Olympics was normal . It appears little about her Olympic encore will be , either . <p> In a sport that sometimes retires its Olympic women 's champions before they retire their braces , Hughes , 17 , is taking a step this week as bold as the performance she used to win gold . She is breaking out of the cocoon of smiles-and-sequins tours and TV specials to return to the glare of scrappy competition in the State Farm U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Dallas . <p> Hughes will be the first U.S. woman to compete in the national championships the year after winning the Olympics . Her gold-medal-winning predecessors immediately turned pro , making them ineligible for nationals , or they retired . <p> She 's doing it with no guarantees , no gilded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but first might tarnish her gold medal . With a sense that against fellow U.S. competitors Michelle Kwan and Sasha Cohen , she still is an underdog . <p> " At nationals , I 've always put a tremendous amount of pressure on myself to make the world team ( the top-three finishers go to the world championships ) , and that 's really the point of nationals , " Hughes says . " This year , I ca n't tell you how I feel because I 'm not even sure myself . " <p> Figure skating observers are rating the women 's field in this U.S. championship the toughest ever in a post-Olympic year . Kwan is a six-time national champion . Two-time U.S. silver medalist Cohen is having a breakthrough season ; she won her first two international Grand Prix titles in the fall . <p> Hughes , meanwhile , has been taking her SATs , considering her college options , making stops on the newfound-fame circuit and nursing a leg injury . Since the Olympics , she has finished second and third at two made-for-TV events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . <p> Against that backdrop , she will embark on an unprecedented quest when the women 's competition begins with the short program Thursday : to win her first national title and , perhaps , her first world title in March at the world championships in Washington . <p> Ivy League or icy paths ahead <p> When Hughes landed two triple-triple jump combinations and rose from fourth to first in the Olympic final last February , she leapfrogged several rungs in skating 's time-honored progression . Most notably , she became the first U.S. women 's Olympic champion not to have at least one national title and/or world title on her resume beforehand . <p> Hughes had won one senior title of any significance before February , at Skate Canada three months before the Olympics . <p> " I have n't been modeled after anyone else . It 's been so unpredictable , " says Hughes , the second women 's gold medalist in Olympic history without a world title . The other was 1920 winner Magda Julin-Mauroy from Sweden , at a time when the worlds were not held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict is whether this will be Hughes ' last shot at national and world titles . Her participation was a certainty only in recent weeks . She 's in the midst of weighing what to do with , as she says , " the rest of my life . " <p> " We talk about those cartoons where the angel is whispering one thing and the little devil is whispering something else , " says Hughes ' coach , Robin Wagner . " She 's having a great training day and comes to me and says , ' This was the greatest decision I ever made . I 'm thrilled to be back here . ' Then she has a rough training day and goes , ' Oh , God , maybe I should be going to college . ' " <p> Hughes has gained early acceptance to Harvard and has applied to Yale , Princeton and Columbia . She wants to major in " something in the sciences " and has spoken of going to medical school . <p> Endorsements tied to results <p> At the same time , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an upswing , and she will be just 20 when the 2006 Games are in Turin , Italy . Hughes is the first women 's gold medalist not to immediately turn pro since Katarina Witt in 1984 . Witt won the Olympics again in ' 88 . <p> Hughes also must consider her moneymaking potential . For now , her father , John Hughes , a Manhattan real estate and tax attorney , is acting as her agent and keeping her commercial exposure low-key . <p> She is a spokeswoman for two programs , General Electric Heroes for Health and Campbell 's Labels for Education . She also was on the Wheaties cereal box . <p> Her father has limited her endorsements to those products , primarily to safeguard her youth , he says . " Winning at 16 , you sort of have a different commercial outlook than winning at 21 , " he says . " If she was 21 , 22 , 23 , I think the philosophy would have been totally different . At 16 and 17 , I would hope that you can have free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With the advent of relaxed rules for Olympic eligibility and a decline in the popularity of professional skating , so-called amateur skaters can make as much , if not more , than professionals . Kwan has been one of the top female endorsers in sports since winning the silver medal in the 1998 Olympics . <p> If Hughes were to continue competing through the 2006 Games , she would be a highly valued endorser , likely earning millions of dollars if she continued to post top results . " Right now things are very open , and I have a lot on my plate to do , " Hughes says . " I think as the season comes to a close , I 'll see where I am with my skating and what I want to do . " <p> She seemingly has three choices : retire from competitive skating to focus on college , delay college to focus on skating or try to do both . <p> " These are n't things that all of a sudden you can say , ' Well , tomorrow I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full training schedule , ' " her dad says . " It 's a process . She 's got to get comfortable with it . " <p> Education has been a primary focus for his daughter off the ice . A senior this year at Great Neck North on Long Island , Hughes is taking Advanced Placement classes in English , statistics and economics , as well as a health class . She looks up to her older sister , Rebecca , a Harvard graduate who is at Columbia Law School , as much as she has any famous figure skater . <p> The day after she won the Olympics , Hughes declared her next goal was to " get in the high 1500s on my SATs . " <p> " I think I might have come off a little arrogant when I said that , " she says . " Now people are continually asking me what I got , but I do n't really want to say what I got . I was very happy with my score . " <p> She was n't happy to discover that during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , strained muscles in her right leg stiffened , further hampering an injury that ultimately forced her to withdraw from the Grand Prix competitions . She had been scheduled to compete at Skate America and Skate Canada , where the pressure to perform like the Olympic champion ( read : win ) would have been less intense than it will be at nationals . Neither event had as many top skaters in the field as there will be this week . <p> " The U.S. has the best ladies in the world , so it 's always a great competition , " says Hughes , who is recovered fully from the leg injury . <p> She finished third at nationals last year behind Kwan and Cohen . She was second to Kwan in 2001 . To quiet the noise and her nerves this week , Hughes will burrow into her underdog status . " I skate the best when people are saying I ca n't do something , " she says . " It 's a little stubbornness , a little bit of my personality , but that 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Going into the Olympic long program , Hughes was in fourth place and scheduled to skate first among the top-four finishers in the short program . She beat those odds with a riveting blend of grace and grit , skating the most technically difficult program by a woman in the Olympics . <p> " She has proved that she can really rally under pressure . Now can she have the endurance of being able to live up to an expectation like the Olympics ? I think she will , " says 1968 Olympic champ and skating analyst Peggy Fleming . <p> Can she rise again ? <p> Predecessors , such as Fleming , are not concerned that Olympic triumph could be diminished if Hughes fails to add national and world titles to her resume . The way she won the gold , they say , makes it a medal and a memory that can not be tainted . <p> " It was n't a so-so , where you just stand up on your feet and you get out and you do it , " 1960 gold medalist Carol Heiss-Jenkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She earned that gold medal , every second of it . Nobody will ever be able to take that away from her . " <p> Since winning , Hughes has met with President Bush in the Oval Office . She has presented a Grammy and won prestigious awards of her own . She performed in 40 Champions on Ice shows . She 's met movie director Steven Spielberg and actor Leonardo DiCaprio . She starred in her own network TV special , which aired Christmas night opposite Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and a Los Angeles Lakers-Sacramento Kings game . <p> This week , her coach says , marks a return to the " crazy normalcy " of competition . Hughes was the oh-so-normal girl who tore through the script of the 2002 Olympic skating competition and gave it a surprise ending . She fell to the floor when she found out she had won . Now she 's back to see if she can rise again . <p> " I ca n't imagine anything would match my Olympic gold medal , and I 'm not looking to match it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and try to make something else exactly the same . Everything 's different , every year is different , every competition is different . And I 'm looking forward to experiencing it .
