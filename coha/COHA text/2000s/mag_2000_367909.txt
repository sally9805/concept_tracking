The show of 99 works by the French artist Jean-Simeon Chardin , now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City , falls just 21 years after the last Chardin retrospective in America  --  which took place at the Cleveland Museum of Art and did n't reach Manhattan . Does the new show add much to our knowledge of Chardin ? In a sense no , because not many fresh facts about him have surfaced in the past two decades . But in the sense that really matters , yes , and yes again . Any extended contact with Chardin is invigorating and marvelous . <P> The show 's otherwise excellent catalog frets a bit . Why , it wonders , should there be another Chardin show so close on the heels of the first ? Well , the answer is that in human life  --  if not in that of a museum or a reputation  --  20 years is a long time . A generation of art lovers ( maybe two ) has come into being since 1979 . All those interested kids who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full stretch ! And , it might have added , what about the rest of us , for whom 20 years is far too long between full exposures to this genius of bourgeois imagination ? <P> No question , Chardin was one of the greatest artists who ever picked up a brush  --  and all the greater for painting without the attributes of greatness . Eighteenth century France was a fine incubator for pictorial grandeur , as in the history pieces of Jean-Baptiste Greuze . Its sexual rhetoric  --  think of Boucher 's pink and frothy shepherdesses  --  was peerless . Since the reign of Louis XIV , whose minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert had striven to connect the visual arts to the very essence of French gloire , every kind of official discourse had flourished in French painting and sculpture , as it did in the arts of Italy . But unofficial life  --  the relatively ordinary pleasures and utterances of the bourgeois center , the common protein of French society  --  did not as yet have its painter laureate . <P> Chardin became that man . There was nothing extraordinary about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His field of social vision was narrow . But by painting what he knew , neither more nor less , he became the standard-bearer of visual truth to a generation of French intellectuals , the Encyclopedists , led by the philosopher Denis Diderot . To them , Chardin 's refusal of the highfalutin theme seemed exemplary . He showed that a jar of apricots on a table could be just as important and freighted with meaning as a battle scene in an epic of Alexander , the impregnation of a nymph by Apollo , or the reception into Heaven of a patron 's patron saint . In time , Chardin 's " natural vision " would be eclipsed by a new form of idealism , that of the neoclassicists , like David . But never for long . People may admire David , but they love Chardin . They cleave to his lack of pretension and see it as something fundamental to the art of painting  --  which it is . <P> Chardin did n't say much  --  at least , not much that he did say has been preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adored his work , like the Goncourt brothers , came from a later generation and never met him . But there is a tantalizing remark attributed to him by a writer of the 1780s , Charles-Nicolas Cochin : " I must forget everything I have seen and even forget the way such objects have been treated by others . " This hints at the extreme pride and immense ambition that underwrote Chardin 's apparently modest arrangements of brown jugs , water glasses , dead rabbits and fruit .
