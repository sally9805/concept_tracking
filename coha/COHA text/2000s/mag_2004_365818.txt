One post advertises 15 hours ' flying time on a 14-seat bombardier jet for the bargain price of $75,000 . Another asks where to buy hunting apparel in Edinburgh .

The six-month-old site connects style-conscious professionals so that they can share jet-setting tips and fine-dining picks . But unlike other cybercommunities like Friendster , you must be invited to aSmallWorld by a member to gain access . Once you 're in , four more members have to " connect " to you before you can ask like-minded friends to join . You connect when you click on a name and the person " accepts " you . <P> aSmallWorld CEO Erik Wachtmeister , 49 , a former investment banker whose father was Sweden 's ambassador to the U.S. , says his 30,000 users are moneyed celebrities , models and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe or North America .

Another site is LinkedIn , which connects in-the-know businesspeople looking for partners and employees . Google has an invitation-only network , orkut , and recently launched an exclusive e-mail service , Gmail . If your invitation to snooty sites gets , um , lost in the mail , you can always check out social-networking free-for-alls such as tribe or MySpace or get-together stalwart Meetup . <P> Meetup CEO Scott Heiferman says that while open sites will , by their nature , remain more popular , the Net merely serves its users . " It 's a public utility , and people do crazy things , " he says . " There 's no standard by which the Internet should operate .

This alerts the webmaster , who warns the offender or bounces him or her into cyberoblivion  --  along with the rest of us.
