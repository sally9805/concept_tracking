No More Lies By Susan Squires Dorchester Publishing Susan Squires It always started with her hand , before it got the rest of her . Holland Banks could sense the dream unfolding yet again , though she could not stop it . She could never stop it . Sweat broke out over her body , soaking the thin cotton of her baby-blue sleep shirt . She opened her eyes on darkness , as she always did . Her hand lay on the white of the sheets beside her pillow . That was part of the dream . So was the feeling of evil that swirled in the room . The dim outlines of the mission oak furniture in her bedroom wavered at the edges of her vision . The ribs of the headboard and the backs of her rockers cast the shadows of a prison on the walls . The slats of the plantation shutters-meant to keep out the Los Angeles lights-were n't doing their job . Thin channels of moonlight cut across the darkness to create the shadows . Even in the canyon you could n't escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes along the balcony drenched the night with a scent that seemed too rich for L.A. So familiar ... so alien . Just like her hand . It lay on the white sheets beside her pillow , consuming her field of vision . The long tapered fingers curled softly , nails made shiny even in the dark by clear polish . The hand had a young woman 's skin , smooth , the ropes of veins still softened byflesh not yet collapsed around them . The hand lay there , quiescent , somehow distant . Yet she could feel the evil pulsing in the darkness , the stench of it mingling with the smell of sweat and star jasmine and the fabric softener her laundry used . The hand was alien , not human at all . What would it not do ? Murder ? Sabotage ? Betray her , her people , her world ? As always , the panic rose in her as she realized that the evil was attached to her . How could she escape the monster when it was part of her body ? The hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Her breath came in ragged gasps . Could it kill her ? Best she chop it off before it tried . With what ? Chinese cleaver ... in the kitchen ? It would try to stop her . She sat up . The comforter duvet in white , embroidered cotton slid to the side . Her hand , that foreign lump of evil attached to her arm , was dragged across her lap . Somewhere a cat yowled . As though the movement wakened it , the hand sent tendrils of evil up her arm . She was too late ! She clutched at the merciless wrist with her left hand , stumbling to her feet . The hand stretched its fingers wide , seeking . It wanted to touch something , something she was afraid of , and if it found what it wanted to touch , the world would be forever changed . Malevolence flowed around her elbow , searching for her heart , her brain . Fear beat at her mind . When the evil engulfed her , she would not longer be able to control what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feel strong , whole . She pushed herself erect , thrusting down the siren call of power . She had to fight it . Somewhere , someone was whimpering . She staggered toward the bedroom door . The pulsing red beat pushed up to drown her heart , her lungs . She gasped , fighting for air . A scream formed in her throat and was stifled there . Her eyes bulged . She sank to her knees . The evil roiled up her carotid artery into her brain . All that was left of Holland Banks was about to be lost and she knew that the kernel of evil had always been inside her , waiting for this moment , and that the kernel was n't human . She was n't human . She never had been . * * * Holland 's own shriek woke her up . She was crouched in a corner , hugging her bare knees . Her gaze darted around the darkened room , cut by channels of moonlight . Nothing . No evil-just the slats of her grandmother 's mission rocker , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the armoire . Her pulse beat in her ears . She sucked in the damp night air from the open window with the scent of star jasmine . Then the shaking began . It 's just the dream , she told herself , hugging her knees even tighter , to stop the shaking . You 've been having it since college . Ca n't you get used to it ? But now it happened almost every night . And the emotion was n't getting easier , though she often realized it was a dream even as she dreamed it . No , her nightmare was getting worse . She listened . But all she heard was the blood humming in her ears . Tinnitus , John had called the condition when she was reduced to consulting him . The constant noise was getting on her nerves . Great . Tinnitus . Yet another thing wrong with her . John even said it often sounded like whispering . God , she could n't believe she 'd been desperate enough to tell him about the whispering . Somehow she had n't liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , at her routine check for the levels of allergen suppressant in her blood . It was easier to ask John at the hospital , maybe because he was n't a friend of her father 's . John 's eyes had gone curious for a moment . No cure for it . He 'd offered her Xanax and said that sometimes helped suppress the noise . But she was not yet reduced to using sedatives . The only other choice was just to get used to it . Tune it out . John might well use her weakness against her , doctor/patient confidence be damned . Why had n't she gone to some doctor who did n't work at her own hospital ? She was being stupid , and someone like her could never afford to be stupid . She pushed the damp blond hair out of her face . Control yourself , she admonished . Your Impostor Syndrome is getting out of hand . Everyone feels like they 're in over their head once in a while . Lots of people feel like they do n't deserve their position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart as they 're cracked up to be . People did n't think they were evil , though , or not human . That was carrying her issue to extremes . It was hell to be a psychiatrist . Diagnosing yourself and everyone around you came a bit too easily . Holland managed a weak smile and shake of her head as the trembling subsided . To center herself , she repeated her achievements like a mantra . Her lungs expanded and she let the air out slowly . Phi Beta Kappa , summa cum laude form Yale , pre-med . Second in her class in med school , though she should have been first-would have been if she 'd been male . Stremski 's research was not nearly as original as her own project . Prestigious funded internship at the Neuro-Psychiatric Institute at UCLA . The ground-breaking studies on schizophrenia . They still called it the Banks Remission phenomenon . Rising through the ranks at several hospitals until now she was Director of Medical Services at Century Psychiatric Hospital , the most prominent private treatment and research center west of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Schizophrenia Research Foundation . Not bad for thirty-four . That 's what the dream was about , just Impostor Syndrome . She was n't evil . She was just an overachiever who worried that someday someone would find out that she had to work harder than anybody else to get where she was and stay there . Someday , hard work would n't be enough to get by , but that day was not yet . Holland suppressed the psychiatrist part which whispered that the whole thing had gone beyond a mild neurosis and that she was bordering on something she would n't like the name of . She even knew the root of the problem . She had a lunch date with him tomorrow , well , today . The clock on the oak antique ice chest serving as a night table glowed three a.m . That must be why the dream had been so virulent . Lunch with her father was always difficult . She sighed and pushed herself up the wall . When she was sure her knees were not too wobbly to hold her , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white embroidered on white over her head . There would be no more sleep tonight . Might as well read that stack of journals sitting on the library table by the door . * * * In the hospital employee parking lot , Holland glanced in the rearview mirror of her Mercedes 450 at the same time as she swung into the space marked DR . BANKS . She 'd chosen her spot in the corner of the flat lot rather than one in the garage because no one could park next to her . With ice plant growing on one side and the vent from the hospital 's heating unit on the other , her car was not subject to the vicissitudes of careless drivers opening car doors . She 'd trade isolation of a covered space any day . Besides , it was L.A. How often did it rain ? When the car had jerked to a halt , she turned off the key but left the radio running as she pulled down the visor and flipped up the vanity mirror cover . Not good news . The roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking its toll . She looked as though she had n't slept . True enough , but it was the last way she wanted to look at work . The radio bared on about the latest sniper attacks . How many of these guys were there ? Simultaneous events in Seattle and L.A. last night . Another four weeks of this and the whole country would be psychotic . She took a compact out of her Dooney and Burke briefcase and layered some self-powered foundation over cheekbones that seemed a little sharp . Not much to do about the shadows under her eyes . The blue of her irises arrested her for a moment . Patients found them unnerving . One had described them as clear turquoise , like the bottom of a swimming pool . Not comforting , on the whole . You drowned in swimming pools . An older woman had said she looked as though she could n't lie . Holland gave an almost inaudible snort . Yeah , was n't that what Impostor Syndrome was all about-the feeling that you were living a lie ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not much difference between that and lying . Her father would no doubt tell her there was no difference at lunch today . He knew all about truth . She patted a pale strand of hair back into her chignon and adjusted a hairpin . Sleek . Professional . That was how she wanted to look . For a moment the voices of her med school colleagues darted through her mind like random shots of a gun , just enough to wound , not to kill . She had come up behind a group of the guys one day as they talked about some woman they called a frigid ice princess . They 'd laughed , right up until one of them noticed her . Their faces had frozen in horror . It was only their expressions that told Holland they were talking about her . Her surprise was closely followed by shame . The flush that filled her had turned to anger . She 'd simply turned and walked away . She had never spoken to any of them again , in spite of several mumbled apologies . Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what she did , what sacrifice ? Did n't they understand what price she paid to be the best of any of them ? She stared in the little mirror , examining the flawless lips , " Plum Mist " filled in for moist perfection ; the big eyes lined with subtle pencil , their naturally thick lashes enhanced with mascara ; wispy fringe of bang to soften her face . Pearl earrings , the big and expensive Tahitian variety , lent their iridescent gray echo to the strand of their fellows around her neck . The gray linen dress with white piping would look crisp under her white lab coat . Professional , brittle ... even , almost , true . That was the way psychiatrists had to look . They had to at least pretend that what they did was scientific . She cut off the radio 's hysteria with another flick of the key and slid out of her little sports car . The news these days seemed calculated to fuel hysteria . Her five-foot-six turned to five-eight in her metallic gray Ferragamo pumps . She slung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lock the car . The sussurrations in her ears got suddenly louder . It was almost like words she could n't quite hear . She glanced around as though they had a source . That was when she saw him . He stood on the sidewalk some five feet above the parking lot about fifty feet away , up toward Third Street . Ice plant , recently watered , covered the slope to the sidewalk . He was looking at her , she was sure of it . His hair was light brown and long . It almost touched his shoulders in the back , and brushed his chin even at the sides . It had n't been cut in a long time-just allowed to grow . As she watched , he pushed his fingers through his hair to get it out of his face . He looked as though he had n't thought to shave for several days . He wore a plaid shirt she would bet was flannel , even in the heat of the L.A. summer . The sleeves were rolled up on his forearms . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was bulky through the shoulders , maybe barrel-chested , and his thighs were thick with muscle . He was definitely staring at her . The rush of sound in her ears whined up the scale until it was almost painful . Help me . What ? What was that ? Her own thoughts given voice ? Or real words in her head , hidden in the tinnitus ? She shook her head but the words were gone , leaving only the roar . As she realized she had been staring back at the stranger , Holland looked away , guilty . She jerked herself around toward the back entrance to the hospital and stalked away . The sounds flooding her ears faded . But the image of the man would not be banished . Had n't she seen him before ? Her thoughts skittered over recent activities . Where ? Hanging around the hospital ? Or ... was it at the gym yesterday ? God ! Panic washed through her . It had been at the gym . He 'd been walking in as she walked out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a stalker . She picked up her pace . Where were the security guys when she needed them ? She practically lunged for the door , but before she could reach it , it swung out , and a pair of huge orderlies coming off the night shift almost ran her down . They were laughing . The door banged into the wall . " Sorry , Dr. Banks , " one stuttered . " Did n't mean to nearly kill you there . " Holland laughed . Damn ! It sounded just this side of panic-stricken . She took a breath and hauled her expression into what she hoped was normal range . " No problem , gentlemen . I 'm just glad to see you two . " Their presence gave her enough courage to turn and glance back across the parking lot . It was empty of people . An SUV pulled in at the far gate . No plaid shirt , no jeans , no long hair . The stalker had vanished . Relieved , Holland stepped through the door one massive orderly held open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know if he was looking at her strangely . As she stepped into the world of gleaming linoleum and pastel walls , the smell of the hospital calmed her . The vague odor of sickness-disinfectant , floor wax , starch , urine , vomit , food that all smelled the same-wafted over her . This was an environment where she knew what was expected of her . She was master of it , in spite of the dreams , in spite of the noise in her ears , in spite of the guy outside . She straightened her shoulders and clicked down the hall to the elevators . She put her professionalism on like a flak jacket . Nurses murmured greetings . Orderlies nodded as they wheeled cold breakfasts to patients in the unlocked rooms . Holland managed to return the greetings with a smile and felt herself come back into focus . That guy was n't stalking her . She could n't even be sure it was the same one from the gym . Two plaid shirts-that 's all she 'd seen . What were the odds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a row ? These dreams were making her nervous . That and the tinnitus . John had n't been able to explain what caused it in her case . She had n't had a blow to the head , or ear infections . Were n't medical conditions supposed to be more clear-cut than psychiatric ones ? Maybe she just needed rest . She could prescribe herself some Ambien to help her sleep , but that was an addictive slippery slope . Dependency was not in her nature . The answer was work . She knew how to work . She pushed through the door into her office suite on the sixth floor . Time to put on the persona . Time for shrink-speak . " Good morning , Chloe . " She put her briefcase on her desk in the inner office and slipped into her lab coat . Chloe handed her a stack of charts . " Rounds in ten minutes , Doctor . " Holland nodded . " This afternoon , I 'd like to review the grant . Did Rhenquist complete the drug therapy section ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
