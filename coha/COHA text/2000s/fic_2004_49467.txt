with thanks to Tomasz Olszewski <p> Witold 's doctor has a pale , diluted appearance , like something left too long to soak . Witold looks away . During this ten-day hospitalization for surgery on a bowel obstruction , he had cataracts removed from both eyes . He 's waking from hundreds of dimly lit days , and he 'll look at what he wants . Each day he sees better . He beholds the glimmering curve of water in a glass , the sheets rumpled over his legs , the strips of light shining through the blinds . <p> " It 's seeded in the peritoneum and liver and possibly in the lungs . You feel nauseated because of congestion in your liver . Tumor makes a person feel anorectic . For nausea we 'll give you Compezine . Reglan to help motility . " <p> The doctor hesitates . Witold waits for him to continue , steals a glance at him . He 's pinching the top of his nose . He 's mentioned that he suffers from allergies . Witold turns away . Politely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for anxiety ? " <p> " Anxiety ? " Witold says , bristling . " I was in a public toilet when the Germans seized me , and I finished what I 'd begun . " <p> The doctor nods and looks down at his chart . Witold is sorry for reproaching him , this skinny young man who has , for the last ten days , treated him with a kind , if tired , diffidence . <p> " For the spasms in the colon , you 'll wear an opiate patch , the Fentanyl . Later , if you need it , we 'll look at a nerve block . I want to see you in my office in a week . Someone will be along here to take you downstairs in a wheelchair . County Services will drive you home . They want to talk about getting you some help caring for your wife . " <p> " County Services " turns out to be a girl , perhaps twenty-five years old . She has a boy 's haircut , which puzzles him , but maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has cut her hair like that . After he is loaded into the car and she pulls out of the hospital parking lot , the girl wants to talk , but how can he be bothered ? He rolls down his window , letting the fresh air stream over him , bringing in as much of the world as he can . The October sky is so blue , it seems as though he could reach up and rap it with his knuckles . Rains during the night have washed the leaves slick and brilliant as carp . They dip and flash in the light . He 's remembering how he used to tie a long yellow leaf to a string on a stick and let Jozef , their son , " fish " in a wash bucket . " Tatus ! " he can still hear him calling . " Look ! A big one ! " <p> " Mr. Czyzowski , how long has your wife been ill ? " <p> He turns his head to watch a boy chase a dog . The boy wears a T-shirt hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and white . It 's finding the chase great fun . And the grasses , leaves , clouds , moving in pulses and currents . A light beams on his head , and he feels faint . <p> " The records say you 're the only one caring for your wife . How did you manage when you could barely see ? " <p> " My wife has many problems , " he snaps , as though clapping a book shut . " No one else would understand them . " <p> " When did your wife 's problems begin ? " <p> What can he possibly say to that ? Should he tell her about the day he came home from work to find Kasia curled around fifteen-year-old Jozef , behaving so strangely that , for a moment , Witold did n't see that their son was dead ? Kasia frantically rubbing Jozef 's face , blowing air into his mouth . Witold could n't take it in at first , even though he 'd seen things like it before . Women trying to force life back into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kasia lost her father and mother and sister in the war , back in Poland . " He takes a deep breath , sending a spike of pain through his gut . " She was especially close to her sister , Agnieszka , who was killed in the Uprising . My wife was never a strong person . Then after our son , Jozef , died , her mind left her altogether . " <p> " I 'm getting confused , " the girl says . " Maybe we should wait until I can make notes . Now , this was World War II ? " <p> " This was World War II , " Witold repeats slowly . <p> " I 'm sorry you lost your son , " the girl says . " Our records say Mrs. Czyzowski saw a doctor shortly after that happened . I guess what I need to know is how recently she 's been examined ? " <p> " And why do you ask so many questions that are none of your business ? " <p> " Mr. Czyzowski , " she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is surprised by how easily prim reprimand comes to this mere slip of a girl , addressing someone three times her age . <p> " Now which street do I take ? " <p> " Farnam , " Witold says . " Take Farnam . " He 's watching two girls , about fourteen years old , play Hot Potato with a sack of groceries . A bag of cookies lands in the drying leaves by the curb . The girls ' faces are American-pink . Witold can guess the cosmetics they use : Cover Girl for oily skin , Cover Stick for blemishes , Kiss Sticks in grape and cherry . <p> For thirty years-before Hested 's closed and left him without a job-he worked in the Health and Beauty Department . He liked stocking things for girls to dab on themselves . Back in Poland , during the war , before the invasion of Lwow , the mothers of the city sent their daughters out to him in the field where he prepared his men for battle . The mothers had no better place to hide them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than children-came with the look of their mothers ' care . Witold 's men left them alone , too . But after a week , their hands were raw with cutting wood and cooking , and he was glad their mothers could n't see them . One morning a girl called Gosia chopped off two of her fingers , one lost at the first knuckle , the other at the middle . He wept as though it had been his fault . <p> " You have a daughter , " the girl in the car says . " Is that right ? " <p> " Yes , " Witold says , " our Malgosia . " <p> " Does she live in Omaha ? I imagine she gives you some help ? Is this your house ? " <p> " Yes , " Witold says , " this is our house . " The girl shuts off the car . Buster races around the yard , barking joyously . Witold clears his throat and blinks , feeling that he might weep , though his eyes feel dry . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " It wo n't take long ; I know you must be tired . " <p> " Assessment ? " <p> " To see what services you need . " <p> He feels queasy , but he opens the car door and answers as levelly as he can : " What does it matter ? " <p> Slowly he goes up the walk while Buster nips at his heels . His abdomen cramps from the sudden exertion , and he pauses until the pain subsides . He wishes Rudy , his neighbor , would walk over , although he suspects it was Rudy who told them about Kasia . How else would they know ? <p> The girl stops behind him . " Oh , your flowers are still blooming ! " <p> He turns and looks at her . She 's tall and scrubbed , and has a graceful way about her . As she bends to sniff a bloom in a tangle of perennials by the porch , her long strand of glass beads swings out , glinting in the sunlight , and she catches them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're sheltered between the house and that tree , " he says , pointing . <p> She is staring past him , at the house . <p> He turns , too , and sees Kasia in the doorway , holding a beer . She wears her pink robe , torn and stained brown in front . " Kasia , " he says , panic making his voice sharp , " get back inside . " <p> Of course she makes no reply . The way she looks is a shock even to him . Her hair stands out in clumps . Her face has caved in . He can barely see her eyes in the grayed flesh , and behind her gaze , she is entirely absent . She works her jaw against one ear and then the other , then out past the end of her nose . <p> He realizes that this is the sight that met his daughter 's eyes when she stopped by two years ago . When she made his granddaughter-already a teenager , beautiful and full of fire , he could see that-stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you breakfast ? Why are you drinking that beer , then ? " He wants to give the impression they have conversations . He knows Rudy was over ; he talked to him before leaving the hospital . Rudy had given her Frosted Flakes with milk , cigarettes , and a can of beer , just as Witold had come to do . Otherwise she 'd lie on the floor and shriek as though he 'd just freshened her pain . <p> The girl comes up behind him , and as they climb the steps , they come into Kasia 's awful odor . " Kasia , go on and let the lady come in , " Witold says , but she does n't move . He nudges her shoulder until she wanders inside . As the girl follows him into the front room , he pulls out a chair and tells her to sit down . He hopes she wo n't go any farther into the house , because it smells even worse in back . Kasia sits down , too . <p> " I 'm going to put water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , no , thank you , " the girl says . " I do n't want anything . " <p> " You must have a bite to eat , " Witold says firmly , going into the kitchen , running water into the teakettle . Rudy has cleaned off a counter . There are a few groceries : tins of fish , a loaf of bread , Hostess snowballs . Triumphantly , Witold tears open the box of snowballs and puts them on a plate , walks back into the front room , and sets them on the coffee table in front of the girl . <p> " Please help yourself , " he says . <p> " Thank you , but I ca n't accept a thing . " She is turning pages in a notebook , trying to act unperturbed . <p> He can tell she 's nervous by the way she turns the pages , one by one , buying time . Well , he tells himself , she 's the one who insists on this , why does n't she get on with it ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest in my home . Please . I just opened these fresh . They 're nothing special , but , please , help yourself . " <p> The girl turns more pages . <p> He looks at the heaps of empty milk cartons , cans , brown paper sacks , a broken fan , a rubber boot , a lamp , knocked over on its side , all of these things drifted with cobwebs and dust . On the table next to him , broken eggshells and dried flecks of yolk on the plaster cast of a baby 's footprint . And in the corner , a mouse , its body on the trap fully desiccated , but the fur still gray and sleek-there 's no mistaking what it was ! Kasia rocks herself in the chair , tapping one foot . <p> " Please do n't be offended , " the girl says , looking up , planting a little smile on her face . " As a matter of ethics , I can not accept food . It 's nothing personal . Now , what sort of schedule is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " She watches television , " Witold begins . Abruptly Kasia leans forward , loudly resuming a quarrel with her older sister Agnieszka , who has been dead some forty years . She gestures , shouting , " Ja nie zabralam Ci rekawiczek . Nie ! " I did n't take your gloves ! No ! <p> Their conversations fill Kasia 's days . <p> The girl asks , in a small voice , " Is she talking to me ? " <p> " Yes , " Witold says . " Please do n't be offended , but she does n't understand what you 're doing here . " <p> She straightens in her chair , draws a breath , and says slowly , in Kasia 's direction , " I 'm here to find out what you need . I want to help you in whatever way I can . " <p> Kasia appears to be listening , but not to the girl . <p> The teakettle whistles . <p> Witold goes to the kitchen and prepares the coffee , his hands shaking as he carries the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he sets them down . <p> " Agnieszko , Twoje wlosy sa tak piekne . Prosze uczesz moje-chcialabym , aby lsnily tak samo . " Agnieszka , your hair is so beautiful . Will you brush my hair until it shines like yours ? Kasia is smiling at her older sister , wheedling and teasing . Sometimes Witold can almost see Agnieszka for himself , raising a magisterial brow , lifting her cloak of gleaming brown hair , dropping it on the other shoulder . <p> " What is she saying ? " the girl asks . <p> " My wife , " he says falteringly , " my wife asks-how terrible this is ! - she asks if she could have your necklace . " The girl runs her fingers through her short hair and clutches the beads . <p> Witold wraps his arms around his abdomen . A light flashes at the side of his skull , and he feels faint . he does not know why he tells this lie , but he continues . <p> " Oh , Witold ! ' my wife said . ' Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle , others a sip of milk ! ' The beads remind her of those her mother sewed on a hat for her sister . A hat to keep the ears warm in winter . " As Witold says this , he lifts his gaze to the girl 's . <p> Her eyes-blue , he notices-are narrowed to slits . <p> " Do n't pay any attention , of course , " Witold says . " You see , she 's not quite right , she does n't know she 's being rude . Her mother had begun making a hat for Kasia when- " he halts , looks down . " It was so many years ago . Please , accept my apologies . " he sits in a chair across from the girl , by Kasia . <p> " Yes , I understand , " the girl says . She speaks in Kasia 's direction , holding the beads , shaking her head . " No , I 'm sorry . " She pats her chest . " Mine . " Consults her notebook . " How is Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She starts writing as he hesitates . <p> " Often she does n't feel like eating anything . But on other days she makes up for it . Why , one day last week , Rudy , our neighbor , who looked after her while I was in the hospital , told me she ate four big meals . I fix her meat , bread , whatever she wants . " <p> She writes and writes . This is the truth , so why does he feel so uneasy ? He 's fed her as well as she would eat . he does n't want the girl here . he wants to walk around his house and look at his things . His Gierymski and Matejko. he wants to hold the dolls , Stefan Batory , Queen Jadwiga , Jan Sobieski . <p> " To what extent can Mrs. Czyzowski take care of herself ? Does she go to the bathroom alone ? " <p> Her cool authority needles him . What accusations would she make ? he wants to hear them ! " Yes , she goes to the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then is quiet . Uneasily he turns his head so he can see her . She has picked up a pisanka , holding it between her long , delicate fingers . <p> " Those are Kasia 's , " he says , feeling encouraged . he picks up another of the painted eggs , one that was Kasia 's favorite , pale blue with magenta and royal blue markings . It feels sticky . A brownish tar coats it , a stickiness on many things in their house . he rubs it on his shirt , but the tarry substance wo n't come off . <p> " You 'll have to excuse my housekeeping . Things got away from me . " <p> Kasia rises from her chair and goes into the kitchen . <p> " I 'm sure you did the best you could , " the girl says . They replace the pisanka at the same time . " You have pretty things . " Such smoothness . His hand is shaking , and he has trouble lighting his cigarette . <p> The refrigerator opens , and Kasia can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pad . he does n't tell how Kasia shrieks when he does n't give her what she wants , when , for instance , he tried shutting off the alcohol . She walks past them into the bedroom and shuts the door . The television comes on loud . <p> " Does Mrs. Czyzowski talk to you very much ? " <p> " Mostly she talks to herself . " Then he thinks of the right thing . " She speaks Polish , always . Even when she 's talking to herself , she 's glad I can understand . " <p> " When was the last time she was examined ? " <p> " I 'm not sure . " <p> " She has n't been to a doctor in what ? Fifteen or twenty years ? " <p> " No . And what would that do but upset her ? " <p> " The county will pay for anything you can not , " she says , allowing herself this rebuke . <p> " It 's not fair to her . It 's not fair to put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It may be true that someone else could take better care of her . But here she 's surrounded by her things . This is where she raised her daughter and her son . She takes comfort from being in her home . She 's had enough in her life to get used to . " <p> " I know you love your wife very much , but you must think of- " <p> " For the sake of Jesus Christ ! " Before he can think , he 's shouting , " I did not say that I love her ! " <p> This silences her . For a moment he 's allowed to hope she 'll go away . he closes his eyes and waits , listening to her breathe . For the first time , he can smell her cologne . It 's not exactly the same , but it reminds him of Muguet , Lily of the Valley . One year Hested 's gave a silk flower with each ten-dollar purchase of the shower splash . he turns his head to look at her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dispel the odor of their house . He 's sorry for frightening her . When she finally speaks , he looks away . <p> " If you do n't love her , why would you keep her here ? Why would n't you have taken her to an institution a long time ago ? You could have had all these years to yourself . " <p> He 's surprised by her questions , surprised that she seems to want to understand . he stands , dizzy for a moment . he goes to his books and picks up a photograph album . he tries to wipe the stickiness with his sleeve . he opens the album to Palmiry Cemetery . all the carved crosses , hundreds and hundreds , a mere body apart . <p> he sets the album on the table in front of the girl and points . " This was my love , my one love , I hoped to marry . " <p> The girl shifts in her chair , making it creak . <p> he closes his eyes to see Agnieszka 's face , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The war separated us . Agnieszka , Kasia 's older sister , was executed during the Uprising while I was in the camp at Flossenburg . " <p> The girl makes a noise of sympathy , distracting him . Sympathy is n't what he wants , although of course she could suppose it . He wants her to understand , so she 'll leave them to their measure of peace . <p> " I was in one trouble after another . I 'd lost myself , you see . The priest in my regiment told me to marry . he thought it would settle me down . " <p> It 's the way he remembers it , the way he 's told it to himself , but something is different . Always before , Agnieszka 's face was at the center , but suddenly he ca n't see it . he swallows and sits still , waiting for his voice to clear . <p> " Then , through a cousin , I found Kasia , hiding with some others , in a church in Warsaw . She had lost everyone-her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from childhood she 'd hoped to marry . " <p> The girl is silent for a moment , then says , " So maybe that was part of her trouble . Knowing you 'd loved her sister . " <p> he sits back in his chair . " We were glad to have each other , " he says quietly . <p> " Mr. Czyzowski , " she says , " I want to check into some services you might qualify for . " She unzips her purse and drops her pen inside . <p> " No , please let me finish , " Witold says , " so that you can understand what Kasia 's life has been . She had some nervous problems . We had a daughter , Malgosia , and she was better for a time . We decided if our next child was a boy , we would name him Jozef , after Pilsudski . Then when our son was born , he was mongoloid . I 'm ashamed to say this , but it was too much for me . My temper had always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be patient for a time , but then ... " <p> His throat fills and he closes his eyes to see lozef " fishing " in the wash bucket , pulling from water a bright yellow leaf Witold had tied with a string to a stick . " A big one , Tatus ! " Jozef would shout , repeating it endlessly , beard growing on his face , until suddenly , Witold 's anger would charge out . " Shut up , you big boy , I heard you already ! " Then he 'd have a bellyache of remorse and want to comfort him , beg his forgiveness , but Kasia would have already flown to wrap herself around him . <p> " But something changed in me , " Witold says , eyes still closed . After enough times of making Jozef weep , he felt a miracle take place in his brain . When Jozef called , " A big one , Tatus ! " he felt his son 's pleasure filling his limbs . Endlessly he could answer , " Jozef , my boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still see him squeezing his forearms in excitement , his hair curling , damp from splashing . <p> he opens his eyes , blinks at the strange girl . " I was able to be kind and patient for hours , and Kasia was happy . Until one day I came home from work , and there was Jozef dead in her arms , heart failure . . . " <p> " Your wife needs medical help , " the girl says , getting to her feet . " And the situation needs to be further evaluated . But I do n't want you to worry . " <p> " No , " Witold says imploringly . " Now that I can see , I can do much better . I 'm going to clean the house , give Kasia her bath every day . Rudy will help us , too . " <p> " And your daughter ? " <p> " Yes , her , too , " he lies . <p> A scream from the bedroom . Witold runs , the girl behind him . <p> " Agnieszka dice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chce zabrac mojego Jozefa , moja Malgosie ! " Agnieszka wants the babies for herself ! She wants to take my Jozef , my Malgosia ! <p> Witold wraps himself around her , telling her , " Nie , Kasiu . Nie ! Nigdy nie oddamy jej ich . Nigdy . " We will never give them to her ! Never ! <p> She is weeping once again with the old fear . Witold strokes her back and tells her , " Badz spokojna , Kasiu , nie martw sie . Nasze dzieci nie nalezaja do niej . " <p> Kasia falls silent , staring ahead . Witold slowly releases her , turns around to look at the girl , who stands in the doorway . <p> " What is it ? " she asks , afraid . <p> Witold takes a deep breath . " Nothing . It is nothing . " <p> " But what was she saying ? Why was she so upset ? " <p> " I hate to tell you , " Witold says . " But it is the beaded necklace again . She gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her of her mother , that she lost so long ago . " <p> The girl hesitates , lifts off the necklace , and tosses it on the bed . <p> " I have to get to my next appointment , " she says , turning to leave . <p> " No ! " Witold objects . " No , do n't leave your necklace . It is not right ! " <p> The girl faces him . <p> " Wait , " says Witold . " I have something for you . " <p> " I 'm not taking anything ! I told you ! " <p> But Witold rushes into the other bedroom and pulls out a box he has kept for years under his small tight bed . The top of the box is dusty , but inside the bottles and jars must be clean . As he carries it out to the girl , who is waiting by the front door , the bottles clink , releasing their odors . <p> " Here , I have all these cosmetics and perfumes going to waste . Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful . " <p> " No , thank you , " she says , not hiding her distaste . " I ca n't accept gifts . It would be unethical . " <p> " It 's not a gift , " Witold says . " It 's the smallest thing , in return for your giving the beads to my wife . You have no idea what that will mean to her . " He sets the box down and tears open the box . " You see , they 've never been opened . They 're left over from the closing of the store . Inside they 're sealed clean as bandages . " <p> He pulls out a palette of eye shadows . There are twenty-four shades and five sable brushes . " Please . I 'd like you to take it . " <p> She accepts it without looking at it . He remembers how his daughter would bend to the mirror , rubbing color on her eyelids with the tip of her finger , leaving spots of her breath on the glass . <p> " Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He looks furtively into her face and sees that she is furious . <p> " Goodbye , " she says , pushing the door open . As she steps onto the porch , the dog jumps on her . <p> " Goddammit , Buster ! Get down ! " Witold yells , shoving the dog aside . It has gone too fast . he tries to follow her , but his gut seizes , and he grasps the porch railing as the world spins around him . he waits for the dizziness to pass . <p> " When you come back , you 'll see how much better it is , " he calls as she drives off . he blinks in the bright sunlight , slowly makes his way back up the steps . At the door he hesitates . He turns around to once more take in the light , which spins crystalline over the leaves and grass . <p> Against the gravity of his exhaustion , he pushes the door open . The drapes are closed , and darkness lies over the room in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelf and picks up Queen Jadwiga . Her stiff gilded dress seems to have been impervious to cigarette smoke and dust , but under the skirt is a thick mat of spider webs . I 'm sure you did the best you could . Pain contracts his gut , and he squeezes the shelf until it passes . he will call Malgosia , or Meg , or whatever she is calling herself now . he will apologize again and again , he will explain why he needs her help . <p> Taped to the refrigerator is a yellowed card with her phone number . His hands are shaking , but he wo n't let himself pause . <p> It rings four times before someone lifts the receiver and says hello . <p> " Malgosia ! Malgosia , is that you ? " Witold shouts . <p> There is a silence before a female voice says calmly , " No . No , it 's not Malgosia . It 's Katherine . " <p> " Katherine ? " he is taken aback , must catch his breath . " Katherine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , that 's what I assumed . " The voice is clear and firm . <p> Witold listens to the hum of the refrigerator . he can feel blood , grainy and soiled , coursing to his face and hands . <p> " Child , how is your mother ? " <p> " I do n't know , " comes the reply . " She left a year and a half ago . " <p> " Left ? " he says , confused . " When will she be coming home ? " <p> " Well , " she says , now cautious for him , " we do n't know . She left without saying anything . " <p> Only Witold 's hand , clutching the phone , feels real . The rest of his body is floating somewhere behind . <p> " Dziadzius ? " <p> His throat swells at her use of the Polish . And the familiarity of her voice , this child of his own blood , he has n't been allowed to see , except at a distance . <p> " You were sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that right ? " <p> " Yes , that 's right . How are things with you and my grandmother ? " she asks . " I mean , why are you calling ? " <p> He ca n't think of how to answer . Finally he says , " I 'm ill . I 'm afraid they will take your grandmother away . " <p> " My father and I will help , " she says immediately . " After Dad gets home from work , I 'll talk to him and call you back . " <p> He is stunned . <p> " Dziadzius ? " <p> " Child , you do n't know where your mother is ? " <p> " She 's probably in California , with her boyfriend , " she says briskly . " But you should n't worry about that now , Dziadzius . Give me your phone number , and I 'll call you as soon as I talk to my dad . " <p> After he hangs up , he goes into Kasia 's bedroom . She is sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Venetian blind . Dust sparkles in the sudden light . <p> " Kasia , I just talked to Malgosia 's Katherine . She 's a good girl , Kasia . Your granddaughter . " <p> He pushes the button on the television , and while the picture hisses and fades above him , he finds a clean housedress in her bottom drawer . It 's pink and gray . he ca n't remember the last time she wore it . he turns to her again . Light falls across her face . he can see that her teeth need work . he will take her to the dentist . Rudy , or perhaps Katherine , will drive them to a dentist . <p> " It 's time for your bath , " he says firmly . <p> With no expression , she follows him into the bathroom . " I 'm sorry , Kasia , " he says . " Here , sit down while I clean the tub . " <p> he settles her on the closed toilet seat while he uses half a can of Borox , scrubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pausing to rest against the wall when his effort brings too much pain . Finally the old porcelain gleams. he rinses it thoroughly , so the cleanser wo n't irritate her skin . After he finishes , he feels faint and must lean against the wall until his blood comes back up . It was n't that long ago that he bathed her , was it ? Sometime before he had to go in the ambulance ? <p> He pats her shoulder and goes to the front of the house , where he has left the things the girl would n't have . he finds the bubble bath and retrieves the string of glass beads from the bed , where she dropped it . <p> He stops the tub and begins running the water , swirling the sweet-smelling stuff under the faucet , building bubbles . <p> " Here , now , " he says , helping her from her robe . The odor is terrible . he sets the robe outside the door . She will have a new one . he settles her in the tub , playfully patting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . As her muscles relax in the warm water , he feels her pleasure in his own arms . <p> " We 're going to wash your hair , too , Kasia , " he says . Like a child she protests , and like a child she submits . She is still slender , and her back holds no tension ; her shoulder blades are the slight wings of a child . He 's remembering how he used to wash Malgosia 's hair at the kitchen sink , careful not to get soap in her eyes . When she stopped by two years ago , she was wearing a fragrance he did n't recognize , but maybe her body remembers how they loved her . <p> She left without saying a word . <p> Dziadzius ? Give me your phone number , Dziadzius . <p> Yes , Katherine 's voice , with that bell-like clarity , the bold certainty , was like Agnieszka 's . <p> He uses a conditioner to untangle Kasia 's hair , strand by strand . Her face contorts . <p> " Chce zabrac mojego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nie , Kasiu ! " Witold says , holding her shoulders , looking into her face . Agnieszka knows the babies are yours ! <p> Rinsing her hair , he tells her , " Kasiu , Twoje dzieci sa bezpieczne . Zobacz , jak dobrze o nie dbasz . Jestes dobra matka . " Your babies are safe . see what good care you take of them . You are a good mother . <p> This quarrel is what is left to him , to release Kasia from what she imagines the dead begrudge her . <p> She calms as he helps her from the tub , pats her dry , combs her hair , rubs lotion on her skin , helps her put on the dress . For him it is different , it is what he may offer them . he holds up the necklace . he says , in Polish , see the lovely glass beads ? They gleam like the ones your mother sewed to Agnieszka 's winter hat ! <p> He lifts the necklace over her head , but she pulls away . She seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opens the window for the clean , fresh air . he gets her tucked under the covers . <p> And the beads ? he finds an empty fragrance carton and winds them delicately into the little box . When the phone rings , he is letting himself down on his knees , to secure them underneath his bed , in the place he knows to hide them . <p>
