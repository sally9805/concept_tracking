Five Chinese artists discover the freedom of creativity in America , which helps them produce powerful paintings . <p> Los Angeles is home to a number of Chinese artists who , over the last several years , immigrated to the United States in search of artistic freedom and the chance to support themselves as fine artists . In a relatively short time , these painters have become a significant presence in California art circles . In fact , they take their share of the top awards in both regional and national competitions and are active members of various art organizations , especially the California Art Club . Shu Qiao Zhou , Calvin Liang , Jove Wang , W. Jason Situ , and Mian Situ are just a few of the numerous artists who have succeeded admirably in establishing their careers . The stories of their individual lives attest to what they are doing right . The key to their success is perseverance , determination , a belief in one 's self , humility , a passion for art , and finally , a willingness to study , practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversities these artists faced living in Communist China also taught them skills that prepared them for starting their careers afresh in America . In their youth , these men lived through the Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976 when all schools were closed . Even when these painters eventually received their training , the Chinese government oftentimes dictated the type of work they could do . They had little opportunity to paint what they wished , and even less chance to sell the results , as there were no private art galleries in their country . <p> Many Chinese art academies did begin providing classical academic training , which became the foundation for their art . The curriculum , which made its way to China from the art schools of 19th-century France via Russia , requires two to three years of drawing plaster casts and painting models . As their work affirms , these artists were well prepared to paint impressionistically and en plein air , the time-honored style of traditional California paintings . SHU QIAO ZHOU <p> Although Shu Qiao Zhou had his share of hardships , he speaks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was born in the Chinese countryside , outside Guangzhou , and grew up with few amenities . His artistic talent was evident , and he was admitted to the prestigious Guangzhou Institute of Fine Arts . The artist received years of rigorous training , focusing on the human form . <p> In China , Zhou had little artistic freedom and was required to participate in the Cultural Revolution during his fourth year at the institute . He painted super-scaled portraits of Chinese leaders for the walls of institutions throughout the country . He was then assigned to the Guangzhou Art Academy , an art studio , where he was required to produce paintings featuring revolutionary themes . Some of these were widely reproduced , making the artist famous throughout China . <p> In 1987 , Zhou came to the United States to Occidental College in Los Angeles as a visiting artist-in-residence , and today he teaches to a small circle of students . For The Miao Girl , he wanted an extremely smooth surface . " I blended the edges of the brushstrokes , and I painted many layers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail work I used small sable brushes . I made a quick painting of the picture and then started a larger version , beginning with a charcoal sketch on canvas . " For the face , he used burnt sienna , yellow ochre , cadmium red light , and cadmium green light . Lately , the artist has been painting thick layers , virtually sculpting the pigment to create a rich texture . <p> Recently , Zhou received the Museum Acquisition Award at the California Art Club 's 91st Annual Gold Medal Exhibition . He is represented by many galleries in California , including J. Kamin Fine Arts in Laguna Beach and Tirage Gallery in Pasadena . CALVIN LIANG <p> According to Calvin Liang , the persistence he has shown in his career comes naturally . One of his early inspirations was seeing an artist painting in the local park . " I told myself , one day if I can do the same thing and make a living , " says the artist , " it would be my dream . " But with the coming of the Cultural Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he graduated from high school . Yet even then , in free moments , Liang kept drawing and painting . <p> Later , he took a post at the Canton Opera Institute to paint sets . While he was there , the institute sent him to study for two years at the prestigious Shanghai Acade my of Fine Arts . After graduation in 1987 , he left China for San Francisco . <p> Liang worked at menial jobs , but tried to remain hopeful about his art . " Many days it felt like my dream of working as an artist was slipping away , " he recalls . Eventually Liang managed to save $500 to buy a few tubes of oil paint , wood boards , and other materials that helped him complete a still life of nine Washington apples . While working on his own pieces , Liang also painted cartoons for Marine World and was a sidewalk portraitist . He joined the Artists ' Guild of San Francisco and began showing his paintings at art fairs . He moved to Los Angeles in 1997 , where he landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nickelodeon , where he continues to work today . <p> Now Liang counts 24 pigments in his palette , adjusting them as the subject matter changes . Unlike many artists who love their old , twisted brushes , Liang has learned that new brushes give him the delicate strokes of pigment that he favors . " The most professional-looking brushwork is made up of clean and simple strokes , " he says . " I need the bristles in perfect condition . " The artist washes his brushes thoroughly after a painting session , sometimes even while he is painting . <p> Liang is a member of the Laguna Plein Air Painters Association , the California Art Club , and the Oil Painters of America , winning the Award of Excellence at the 10th Annual National Juried Exhibition in 2001 . He is represented in California by the Waterhouse Gallery in Santa Barbara and Tirage Gallery in Pasadena . JOVE WANG <p> When Jove Wang was just a child , his grandfather read the boy 's palm and predicted good fortune . He has had his share , but his success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beginning when he was a boy . Wang 's mother , noticing her son 's interest in art , made sure he spent time with an artist each day after school . Every chance he had , he would watch the artist at work . " One of the best ways to learn to paint , " the artist advises , " is to spend time in a good artist 's studio . It 's important just to look . " His tutor instructed him to draw everything he could . <p> Today , Wang 's paintings are a mix of free brushwork and elegant detailing , which determines the focal point of the work . He grips the tip of the brush , which allows him greater control in moving his arm and hand . Laying in his compositions with No. 8 or No. 10 brushes , he later paints the details with a No. 2 . The artist employs Robert Simmons brushes and prefers the filbert style because its curved form allows him to use it like a knife to place shape and line . When he begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or light pigments . He finishes a piece with single , brisk strokes . <p> In 1990 , Wang arrived in Los Angeles and soon found a job with a collection service , where his boss introduced him to friends who wanted portraits . Soon the artist was able to support himself , and began devoting much of his time to the Chinese-American art community . Today he teaches art and led a painting tour to northern China last fall . <p> Wang studied at the Jilin Academy in northern China for three years , and later at the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Art , near Shanghai , an extremely selective school . The academy also sent him as an exchange student to study for six months at the prestigious Tokyo Academy of Fine Arts in Japan . <p> Wang received Best of Show in the 1997 Gold Medal Exhibition of the California Art Club and , most recently , Best of Show and Artists ' Choice at the Carmel Art Festival last spring . The artist is represented in California by Galerie Gabrie in Pasadena and the Gallery Americana in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tucson . W. JASON SITU <p> W. Jason Situ 's plein air landscapes are full of color and detail , while still retaining a sense of depth . One way he ensures this effect is to choose pigments that relate to one another . " After I finish a painting , I scrape together all the paint remaining on my palette to make a rich gray , " explains the artist . " Then I take a fresh , white , primed canvas and cover the entire area with the gray paint . I set this aside , and when the paint is dry , I use this canvas for another painting . " He says that while working on white canvas might produce better color , the grayed surface can result in a beautiful background that can help hold an image together . <p> Situ believes that artists should first experiment with and master the technique they plan to use . " If you paint over the gray before it is completely dry , the picture might muddy as the gray mixes with the fresh paint , " he warns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific gray  --  whether warm , cool , dark , or light  --  complements the scene . " Another approach to emphasizing color in his paintings is to first lay in the image with a palette knife , then shape and detail the piece with a brush . <p> He advises art students to learn the foundations of painting first , then find their own way . To make his point , he quotes a Russian writer , saying , " In the world are a lot of dogs ; each makes its own bark . " <p> His life began simply , on a farm in a small town in southern China . When school closed due to the Cultural Revolution , Situ studied art informally with friends , including Mian Situ . He also painted en plein air with local artists . After the turbulent movement , he spent two years studying at the Guangzhou Institute of Fine Arts . Eventually he became an art teacher at his former high school until he left China for the United States . <p> Situ was always looking for some way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1989 . He copied European paintings for a gallery , drew tourist portraits in Chinatown , and painted T-shirts . His dedication paid off in 1995 when he won Best of Show at an exhibition sponsored by the San Gabriel Fine Art Association in California . <p> Situ is a member of the California Art Club and a signature member of the Oil Painters of America and the Laguna Plein Air Painters Association . He is represented by Long Gallery in Scottsdale , Arizona , and in California by Tirage Gallery in Pasadena and Lee Youngman Galleries in Calistoga . In April 2001 , Situ won the Oil Painters of America National Award of Excellence at the 10th Annual National Juried Exhibition . MIAN SITU <p> Mian Situ 's paintings of American landscapes are filled with intense , rich color . He uses the warm pigments of Grumbacher and Winsor &; Newton , explaining that one can never have enough yellow ochre , earth red , or raw sienna on a palette . The China-born artist also mixes lamp black or ivory black with titanium white to achieve the gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat brushes to complete the detail work that epitomizes his pieces . These brushes are excellent for controlling and delineating the edges found in his fine work . Situ paints on a canvas because the slight flexibility of the surface allows him a personal expression that he ca n't achieve on board . <p> A unique expression was something that Situ could not exercise in his homeland . Born to farmers in the province of Guangdong , the artist was just 13 when the Cultural Revolution began . " I had some friends who were drawing posters in support of the revolution , " he recalls . " Because of them , I decided to try painting . " <p> To learn more about art , Situ needed books , but libraries were closed and books on Western art banned . " My friends loaned me books , and even though the printing was poor and most pictures were in black and white , these were my treasures , " the artist remembers . " Since I could n't keep them , I copied the pictures and text using graphite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own , he also started to practice life drawing . <p> In 1972 , Situ was accepted to the Guangzhou Institute of Fine Arts . " We drew from plaster casts and had to spend a week on each aspect , such as drawing the eye , " explains the artist . " We were only allowed to work with graphite , which forces an artist to know exactly the value he or she is trying to record . With charcoal one can smear it and achieve a range of values more easily . " <p> Then , after three years , the government ordered Situ back to the countryside to work as a projectionist showing propaganda films . Later he returned to the institute , graduating and teaching there . However , he wanted to study art in America , and in 1987 , he received a student visa and moved to Los Angeles . At one point , he worked for a commercial gallery and copied traditional European paintings for $75 a picture . " When I was teaching art in China , I was paid only $12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is represented by Trailside Galleries in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , and Scottsdale , Arizona ; the Waterhouse Gallery in Santa Barbara , California ; and the Greenhouse Gallery of Fine Art in San Antonio , where , at a recent show , he sold 40 of his 42 paintings the first night . Most recently , he won a top award at the Masters of the West Exhibition at the Autry Museum of Western Heritage in Los Angeles . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Miao Girl , by Shu Qiao Zhou , 1995 , oil , 50 x 37 .
