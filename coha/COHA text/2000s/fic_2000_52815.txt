August 25 . I 've really had very little chance to pick up this notebook in the three weeks since I took up my new duties in this village with the unpronounceable name of Asvestohori . My group is officially assigned the task of distributing medical supplies to our troops quartered here and the task of supervising the municipal water service that is supposed to keep our water pure in this region . Except for part of one day a week , the work here is endless , with only the occasional hour or two of free time , usually after the night has blackened our barracks . Those of us who have been transferred from other Wehrmacht units are put to work at the most menial assignments outside our official duties , as though we are new recruits meant to earn our right to belong to the society of our veteran companions , some of whom have been in this war for a much shorter time than I have . Even among those who have been transferred here there is an order of priority , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rank of private  --  sometimes no more than children  --  work under me . And much of the work I supervise as corporal in my unit is the most humiliating kind , sometimes the garbage area in the kitchen , sometimes the toilet area , which is hardly more than a series of filthy tiled holes in the ground . <p> My official medical duties are a relief : two periods a day in the supply room arranging bottles and packages , and one or more trips a week into the countryside to help with purifying our water supply . These trips have the feel of a brief escape from prison . We are given the whole of a morning to complete our work , because the officer in charge of our group is himself in no hurry to return to our unit in Asvestohori . He likes to linger over a coffee and a cognac in the village of Hortiati in the foothills of the same mountain that rose behind us south of here during my days in our Salonika headquarters near the village of Arsakli . After we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of us from the lower ranks are assigned to the local first aid station for an hour or so of treating the Hortiati villagers for minor injuries . Then , while our leader sips his second cognac , we are allowed to wander in the village as we please for a while or walk the fields below in the neighborhood of the water source , our official excuse for being in the open countryside so pleasurably long . I mostly walk the fields . There is a high point above the ruined aqueduct that marks our source , and from this high point I can see across the valley to the meadow where I used to spend the only hours during my two years in this country when I could know the kind of peace I left behind in our valley outside Graz . That high point is where I take my rest , for as long as I can bear it . <p> My several trips into the countryside have also given me a chance to talk with the men of the municipal water service in a mix of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some education , it seems , whom we are meant to escort and supervise in this operation . I 've learned more than I choose to tell the others from these bits and pieces of conversation during those moments when we stop briefly to escape the sun under a tree or in the shade of our armored car . It is clear that some of these Greeks not only fear that Germany has lost the war but that we will be leaving their country soon and they will be in danger for having worked at our side , the enemy 's side . I try to convince them that surely their work as water purifiers will be considered by the local people to have been necessary work , but either my primitive Greek is inadequate or their cynicism is too deep to allow simple words to penetrate their gloom . <p> I do n't argue with them about the question of when we will be leaving . Every single day rumors pass through our unit that our army 's departure has already been decreed , and no one doubts any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris has fallen to the French , that the Bulgarians have withdrawn from the war so that our northeastern flank is now exposed , that there is total mobilization at home . This tells us how desperate the situation must be since there is surely no one left to mobilize other than children and old men . The only question now is when we will be leaving Greece : this month , the next , in any case certainly before Christmas . <p> Is it too much to hope that I may be in Graz by then , dear Lotte ? Dare I hope that ? I 'm not sentimental about Christmas , not anymore , but I remember that you are . Forgive me if I recall how much you cried when you were eight and they denied you the role of the Virgin Mary in your school play because you were considered too small to hold the infant Christ in your arms . And so instead you became a pouting angel at the back of the set with one wing broken and a look in your eyes that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you finally got the role three years later , you still cried about it , though that was because you could n't stop brooding over whether you were good enough for the part . The worry that this brought into your sweet face made you a perfect grieving Mary even if it was at your child 's birth rather than his death . <p> Do you mind if I continue to amuse myself by pretending to write you in this secret way ? Since I am certain that nobody will ever see this soiled little notebook , there surely can be no harm in my being playful about these things that mattered so much to you then , during the intimacy of our childhood together . Does your belief matter so much to you still ? I wish I could talk to you about it as I once could , but I 'm afraid I would be no use to you in that way any longer . If there is a God , He is not with us here . Our God has forsaken us or was never with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now alone in a wilderness of our own making . <p> September 4 . I must write about what has happened . I think it 's the only way I can hold myself together , keep my mind from going out of control . I have more time now than I could want , because things have fallen apart here , and for the moment I seem to have been forgotten . I sit by myself hour after hour waiting for some new assignment , but none has come . My old assignment , the best part of it , vanished last Saturday , our usual day for purifying the water below the village of Hortiati . There was an ambush , and Naegele was killed . Naegele is the sergeant who has been with our medical group far longer than any of us and who would always go with me into the village to treat those villagers who wait for us each week outside the first aid station . He had been doing that for months , more than a year , and the villagers had come to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a German soldier . They would kneel before him sometimes , cross themselves , much to his embarrassment . He was only a little older than me , but the war had turned his blond hair mostly white . Everyone in that village must have known Naegele by now . I ca n't believe any one of them would have lain in wait to kill him , though I 've come to believe anything is possible in this war . Some say it was the Communists who did it , a guerrilla unit camped on the mountain . The one certain thing about what happened is that Naegele is now dead , and because of that , the village of Hortiati is burned to the ground in retaliation . <p> I ca n't help but think that this was my fault . I was assigned to drive the car . When the ambush wounded our officer , Leutnant Ebert , who was riding in the back seat , Naegele opened the front door to see what was going on and was shot in the face . I pulled him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed , toward the aqueduct , then realized my mistake and swung around to head back the way we 'd come . The shooting was going on , but it must have been aimed at the car on the far side of the road belonging to the municipal water service . Leutnant Ebert was moaning in the back seat , so I knew he was still alive , but I could tell that Naegele was dead beside me even though I could n't bring myself to look at what was left of his face . <p> I drove on like a maniac until I came to the place where the road splits . I took the left branch heading toward Arsakli and our old headquarters , then decided that was too far to go with a wounded man and backed out to head toward Asvestohori . I stopped to look at Naegele , then took off my shirt to cover his head , and when I looked in back I saw that Leutnant Ebert had his eyes closed and was white , but he was still breathing , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . As we arrived at the outskirts of Asvestohori , Leutnant Ebert came to suddenly and asked where we were . I told him , then asked him if we should stop to work on his wound . He said it could wait , it was only his arm , grazed by a bullet . When we reached the guardhouse , he was out of the car and past the guard before I could get out to help him . He picked up the phone in the guardhouse , I suppose to sound the alarm . I called one of the guards over to help me carry Naegele into the shade . <p> I know now that I should have kept going on the road to Arsakli as I started to . It would have taken us much longer to get help , yes , but that might have been long enough to save the villagers in Hortiati . That is what Naegele would have done . Instead I took the short route for the benefit of Leutnant Ebert . And that hardly gave the villagers , in any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains before he sounded his alarm . He must have got through to Arsakli by phone from the guardhouse , got through to the intelligence headquarters which is responsible for counter-resistance operations , because the retaliation started almost immediately . The trucks in our compound had begun to fill up with men before we 'd managed to wrap Naegele in a blanket and carry him inside the mess hall . And by the time we did , the famous Sergeant Schubert had arrived outside our compound with his specialists from the Partisan Pursuit Unit and their Greek informers . We all knew something terrible was going to happen . There were too many trucks and armored cars lined up for a simple counter-ambush operation . And it happened , within the hour . And while it happened , all I could do was sit on the floor beside Naegele 's body and hold my head and try to understand why he was the one who 'd been killed rather than Leutnant Ebert or me . Naegele would have shot Leutnant Ebert before he would have let him do harm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They took me there yesterday . An investigation team , two officers and their aides , arrived from the intelligence unit in Arsakli to interview Leutnant Ebert . Since he was n't thought healthy enough to ride in a car , I became the only witness who could show them where the ambush had taken place . One of the officers from Arsakli was the same thin-faced Nazi with the quiet voice who had questioned me last month at the intelligence headquarters in the schoolhouse , but he pretended not to recognize me and I saw no reason to recognize him . The other officer , even taller and large-nosed , was said to be the one who turned in his counterpartisan intelligence reports with a single W for his signature that was so slanted and shapeless he no doubt hoped it would serve to hide him from history . <p> I showed them where we 'd been ambushed . That should have been enough , but they made me stay with them through their tour of the village beyond . There was little left that one would call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of them blackened shells , some ashes only . There was total silence in that place . The bodies of those who had been shot in the streets were mostly gone . We barely stopped to look at those still left , men and women of all ages . The smell of charcoal and burned flesh was everywhere , but especially on one street near the center of the village where the bakery used to be . We heard that Schubert came back from the reprisal bragging to our men about how he had saved ammunition by filling that bakery with all the stragglers he could round up , dozens and dozens , then sealing the door and burning them to death . Nobody went very far into that street and nobody took notes . <p> The investigation team turned back before we 'd reached the upper edge of the village . They said there was nothing more to be seen that had n't been seen already , but the real reason was that one of the aides had become sick from the smell , and there was talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being watched from the hills . One of the officers , the one who pretended not to know me , said he was certain he 'd heard the sound of a shepherd 's flute on the mountainside above the village , and this made him realize suddenly that we were completely exposed . He 'd taken it for a signal . I 'd heard it , too , and I 'd thought it a sound that could chill the gods . <p> <p> By Edmund Keeley <p>
