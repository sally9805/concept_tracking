ONE <br> Garmisch , Germany <br> Tuesday , December 11 , The Present <br> 1:40 pm <br> Cotton Malone hated enclosed spaces . <br> His current unease was amplified by a packed cable car . Most of the passengers were on vacation , dressed in colorful garb , shouldering poles and skis . He sensed a variety of nationalities . Some Italians , a few Swiss , a handful of French , but mainly Germans . He 'd been one of the first to climb aboard and , to relieve his discomfort , he 'd made his way close to one of the frosty windows . Ten thousand feet above and closing , the Zugspitze stood silhouetted against a steel- blue sky , the imposing gray summit draped in a late- autumn snow . <br> Not smart , agreeing to this location . <br> The car continued its giddy ascent , passing one of several steel tres &shy; tles that rose from the rocky crags . <br> He was unnerved , and not simply from the crowded surroundings . Ghosts awaited him atop Germany 's highest peak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People like him , who buried their past so determinedly , should not help it from the grave so easily . <br> Yet here he was , doing exactly that . <br> Vibrations slowed as the car entered , then stopped at the summit station . <br> Skiers flooded off toward another lift that would take them down to a high- altitude corrie , where a chalet and slopes waited . He did n't ski , never had , never wanted to . <br> He made his way through the visitor center , identified by a yellow placard as Mncher Haus . A restaurant dominated one half of the building , the rest housed a theater , a snack bar , an observatory , souvenir shops , and a weather station . <br> He pushed through thick glass doors and stepped out onto a railed terrace . Bracing Alpine air stung his lips . According to Stephanie Nelle his contact should be waiting on the observation deck . One thing was obvious . Ten thousand feet in the high Alps certainly added a height &shy; ened measure of privacy to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A succession of snowy crags rose south toward Austria . To the north spanned a soup- bowl valley ringed by rock- ribbed peaks . A gauze of frosty mist shielded the German vil &shy; lage of Garmisch and its companion , Partenkirchen . Both were sports meccas , and the region catered not only to skiing but also bobsledding , skating , and curling . <br> More sports he 'd avoided . <br> The observation deck was deserted save for an elderly couple and a few skiers who 'd apparently paused to enjoy the view . He 'd come to solve a mystery , one that had preyed on his mind ever since that day when the men in uniforms came to tell his mother that her husband was dead . <br> " Contact was lost with the submarine forty- eight hours ago . We dispatched search and rescue ships to the North Atlantic , which have combed the last known position . Wreckage was found six hours ago . We waited to tell the families until we were sure there was no chance of survivors . " <br> <br> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did n't mean she was n't devastated . Years passed before questions formed in his teenage mind . The government offered little explanation beyond official re &shy; leases . When he 'd first joined the navy he 'd tried to access the court of inquiry 's investigative report on the sub 's sinking , but learned it was classified . He 'd tried again after becoming a Justice Department agent , possessed of a high security clearance . No luck . When Gary , his fifteen-year- old , visited over the summer , he 'd faced new questions . Gary had never known his grandfather , but the boy had wanted to know more about him and , especially , how he died . The press had covered the sink &shy; ing of the USS Blazek in November 1971 , so they 'd read many of the old accounts on the Internet . Their talk had rekindled his own doubts  --  enough that he 'd finally done something about them . <br> He plunged balled fists into his parka and wandered the terrace . <br> Telescopes dotted the railing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an unflattering bun . She was dressed in a bright outfit , skis and poles propped beside her , studying the valley below . <br> He casually walked over . One rule he 'd learned long ago . Never hurry . It only bred trouble . <br> " Quite a scene , " he said . <br> She turned . " Certainly is . " <br> Her face was the color of cinnamon which , combined with what he regarded as Egyptian features in her mouth , nose , and eyes signaled some Middle Eastern ancestry . <br> " I 'm Cotton Malone . " <br> " How did you know I was the one who came to meet you ? " <br> He motioned at the brown envelope lying at the base of the tele &shy; scope . " Apparently this is not a high- pressure mission . " He smiled . " Just running an errand ? " <br> " Something like that . I was coming to ski . A week off , finally . Al &shy; ways wanted to do it . Stephanie asked if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that along . " She went back to her viewing . " You mind if I finish this ? It cost a euro and I want to see what 's down there . " <br> She revolved the telescope , studying the German valley that stretched for miles below . <br> " You have a name ? " he asked . <br> " Jessica , " she said , her eyes still to the eyepiece . <br> He reached for the envelope . <br> Her boot blocked the way . " Not yet . Stephanie said to make sure you understand that the two of you are even . " <br> Last year he 'd helped out his old boss in France . She 'd told him then that she owed him a favor and that he should use it wisely . <br> And he had . <br> " Agreed . Debt paid . " <br> She turned from the telescope . Wind reddened her cheeks . " I 've heard about you at the Magellan Billet . A bit of a legend . One of the original twelve agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so popular . " <br> " Stephanie said you were modest , too . " <br> He was n't in the mood for compliments . The past awaited him . " Could I have the file ? " <br> Her eyes sparked . " Sure . " <br> He retrieved the envelope . The first thought that flashed through his mind was how something so thin might answer so many questions . <br> " That must be important , " she said . <br> Another lesson . Ignore what you do n't want to answer . " You been with the Billet long ? " <br> " Couple of years . " She stepped from the telescope mount . " Do n't like it , though . I 'm thinking about getting out . I hear you got out early , too . " <br> As carelessly as she handled herself , quitting seemed like a good ca &shy; reer move . During his twelve years he 'd taken only three vacations , during which he 'd stayed on constant guard . Paranoia was one of many occupational hazards that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement had yet to cure the malady . <br> " Enjoy the skiing , " he said to her . <br> Tomorrow he 'd fly back to Copenhagen . Today he was going to make a few stops at the rare- book shops in the area  --  an occupational hazard of his new profession . Bookseller . <br> She threw him a glare as she grabbed her skis and poles . " I plan to . " <br> They left the terrace and walked back through the nearly deserted visitor center . Jessica headed for the lift that would take her down to the corrie . He headed for the cable car that would drop him ten thou &shy; sand feet back to ground level . <br> He stepped into the empty car , holding the envelope . He liked the fact that no one was aboard . But just before the doors closed , a man and woman rushed on , hand in hand . The attendant slammed the doors shut from the outside and the car eased from the station . <br> He stared out the forward windows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces were another . He was n't claustrophobic . More a sense of freedom denied . He 'd tolerated it in the past  --  having found himself underground on more than one occasion  --  but his discomfort was one reason why , years ago , when he joined the navy , unlike his father , he had n't opted for submarines . " Mr. Malone . " He turned . The woman stood , holding a gun . " I 'll take that envelope . " <br> Continues ...
