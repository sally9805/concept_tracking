Country singer clay Walker is known for singing , not talking . His albums , including A Few Questions ( 2003 , RCA ) and his eleven number-one hit singles have been rocking country music charts for more than a decade . Curb Records will release a long-awaited new album later this year . But people with MS have been hearing a different side of clay . He 's been showing up at MS 150 Bike events-and at educational seminars for people with MS . Not because he adopted our cause out of the blue . clay has been living with MS since 1996 . We caught up with him just before he gave a stirring concert , sponsored by leva Neuroscience , Inc. , at the Society 's National Conference last fall . We asked him about his life and what he 'd like to say to other people with MS . Photograph // My whole family is musical , my sisters have great voices , my father , my uncle . My grandfather was a musician ... and all my cousins sang . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and playing so it was just natural that I went into music . It was what I was supposed to do . I was with my band in Calgary , Alberta , and we were playing basketball one afternoon . All of a sudden my leg was asleep . I kept shaking it . And then I was falling down on the court . When I looked up I saw two hoops . By the time I got off the court , I 'd completely lost my balance . We were doing a show that night . It was probably the scariest moment of my life getting on that stage . I could n't hold a guitar pick no matter how hard I tried , my fingers were that numb . I had to play with my fingers , which I do n't do . I knew something was really wrong . And then the fun began . I started having a facial spasm that ran from the top of my head down to my chin . It went on so hard and for so long I actually got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms . Multiple sclerosis . I 'd never heard of it . I had it mixed up with ALS ( Lou Gehrig 's disease ) or maybe MD ( muscular dystrophy ) . My doctor told me to go home , get plenty of rest . That was it . Well , I could n't believe it happened . I was married and our first child was just three months old . How was I going to take care of her , of my family , of myself ? Was this thing going to take my career ? Even my life ? I was so broken spiritually , so broken physically and mentally , I did n't know if I could pick myself back up . I think that most people who get diagnosed go into a little bit of denial . It 's really a self-protecting thing . I think it 's good to have that denial , but then you have to start living again . You have to come out of that shell . It took me some years to do that . We 've come so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without the drug I 'm taking , I really do n't know where my life would be . On my very first CD there was a song called " Dreaming with My Eyes Open " - an up-tempo , fast-beat song . I almost considered not recording it . It did n't strike me as a song I could sing great , but my producer talked me into it . It became one of the most played songs of that year , and today , every time I sing it , it gets more and more special to me . It says I 'm going to do my dreaming with my eyes wide open . That 's what we all have to do with MS . Dreaming with eyes open is a vision . When you close ' em , it 's just a dream . I have this vision that one of these days there 's not going to be any such thing as MS . For the rest of my life I want to do everything I can to help find the cure for MS and , at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . About half of the people who could be taking one of these drugs , just are n't doing it . They are n't managing their MS . I think they 're in the denial stage . I know they need to dream with eyes open . I know there are goofy people out there who think the government or medicine is trying to give us the shaft ; that there might really be a cure but they 're not releasing it . I promise you if there were a cure , it would be out here . For right now , these therapies really do help . I 've had five years of remission . No relapses . Who knows what 's going to work for each individual ? I know that . But I hope I can give people encouragement . You really can recover some of the physical things that you 've lost to MS if you dedicate yourself to a little bit of exercise every day . In the summer , I 've been riding in the MS 150 Bike Tours around the country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . I 'll be honest with you : I 'm not the athlete I used to be . MS has taken a little away from me . Still , I think I 'm probably in the best shape of my life right now . That 's because I 've decided , well , what 's the best that I can be ? I 'll never be an NFL football player . But what 's the best I can be ? Just compare yourself to yourself , is what I learned . Do n't look at a family member or your best friend . Look at where you are right now when you start . Then look at where you are three months from now , six months from now , a year . I hope that one day we have some better therapies . That we 'll have some doctors who can repair nerves . I have all kinds of dreams . But for right now I know I can take care of myself and benefit from it . So I want to tell people do n't wait around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you can play catch-up with later on . Make no mistake , this disease is not one dimensional . You have to take care of your mind , body , and spirit . Whatever a person 's belief system-and I hope each person has one-you have to rely on that . I 've had to pull very deep on my faith . I do n't think any one thing is more important for me than another : my faith , my medicine , my family , the fountains of support that I got . I think that all of those things are absolutely intertwined . I always tell people the first thing I did was to get rid of all my high maintenance friends . You realize there 's no reason to be miserable . We can choose the attitude that we have-it 's about the only thing we really can choose . I truly feel it 's important , especially if a person does n't have good support , to get involved with the National MS Society , get involved in these MS events , because they 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to find someone else who 's struggling and knows what you feel . There really is camaraderie here . One of the reasons I love the National MS Society is that they focus on the people , not the disease . The events and the meetings seem intimate no matter how big the crowd is . I 'm so impressed by that . I know a lot of people with MS fear for other people finding out . I 'd like the public to know that MS is not a death sentence . The more awareness of that we get out there , the better . I truly think people who have MS have more to offer society than your average person . Your whole life changes . For me , it really took the blinders off . I can spot a phony a mile away . I say this all the time : You ca n't BS someone with MS . So I 'd like people out there to know that if you 're lucky enough or blessed enough to meet someone with MS , you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes people more worthy . I know I 've met wonderful , heartfelt , deep people . Artistic . Deep philosophers . It 's amazing . Sometimes I think there are no dummies with MS except for me . Once I feared I would n't walk my daughter down the aisle . Now I have two daughters and I do n't fear that anymore . I do fear for people who have progressive MS and I hope in the next little while the doctors will find a therapy that works for them . I ca n't help but believe that , with all the great scientists and the great research that 's going on , that will happen . Looking back to when I was diagnosed , I know I 've come a long way . The fear of MS is just terrible . When you lay down in bed at night , well , I know those nightmares . That 's why I want to be a role model . We have to have a good outlook and not let MS define who we are . It 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that defines us . Sidebar " I had brutal symptoms .
