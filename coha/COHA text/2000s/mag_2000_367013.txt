Betsy McCaughey Ross , a former Lieutenant Governor of New York , is a fighter . When Republican Governor George Pataki dumped her as his second-term running mate in 1997 , she switched parties and made a bid to unseat him . Today she is fighting another former partner , millionaire financier Wilbur Ross , whom she married in 1995 and is now divorcing . At the center of their dispute is her claim that she was forced to sign a document that is suddenly becoming an accessory to many modern marriages : a postnuptial agreement . That 's right  --  after the vows , not before . <P> It 's another by-product of the booming U.S. economy . Prenuptial agreements have long been used by couples who want to set down the terms of any future divorce before they walk down the aisle . But what happens when one spouse unexpectedly comes into great wealth after marriage and wants to alter the terms of a potential divorce settlement ? Enter the postnuptial agreement . " Anytime somebody is going to come into substantial unforeseen wealth , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship , " says John Mayoue , an Atlanta lawyer who says the proliferation of Internet millionaires  --  though they are a little scarcer after this month 's market plunge  --  has had a " huge " influence on his firm 's postnup business . These contracts are worked out with personal attorneys and do n't usually have to be filed in court , so it 's impossible to determine exactly how widespread they are . But veteran lawyers say the number of mid-marriage agreements has exploded in the past five years , perhaps as much as tenfold . <P> Like prenuptial agreements , postnups can be a few paragraphs or several pages long , typically spelling out what the dependent spouse claims or waives in the event of a divorce . Their unique terms can supersede state laws , though their legal status is still unresolved in many jurisdictions . Most states have laws that govern the enforcement of prenups , but only a few have dealt with the relatively new postnups . The rules vary . New York and Florida have ruled that postnups are enforceable , but North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judge . In Hawaii they are valid only if the judge deems the terms fair at the time of signing as well as at divorce  --  meaning a spouse whose wealth has grown substantially since the agreement may have to renegotiate at separation . <P> That standard has also been upheld in New Jersey , where Francesca and Antonio Pacelli battled over the validity of their postnuptial agreement . They had been married 10 years in 1985 , when , she says , he told her to choose between divorce and signing a postnup . Under the agreement , she was to be awarded $500,000 and half of a $1 million summer home if they divorced . But when Pacelli , a developer , filed for divorce in 1996 , his wife argued that she was entitled to more of his fortune , which had increased from $5 million to $11 million , and she sued . The New Jersey Superior Court eventually ruled that the agreement was " not fair and just , " and the couple is renegotiating . Jeffrey Weinstein , Antonio Pacelli 's lawyer , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it voluntarily . " A judge should not impose his or her standard on two people 's bargain , " says Weinstein.
