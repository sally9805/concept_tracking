Chapter One Not once or twice in our rough island-story The path of duty was the way to glory . - Alfred , Lord Tennyson " Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington " Xenos on Cinnabar The pair of footmen at the head of the stairs bowed to Daniel ; the older one said , " Senator Kearnes will be most pleased that you 're able to attend , Lieutenant Leary . " " Pleased to be here , " Daniel said . He smiled as he passed into the ballroom which took up most of the second floor of the Kearnes townhouse . Indeed , he was pleased . The invitation to Lira Kearnes ' fortieth birthday gala specified that officers were to wear full medals rather than ribbons . The request might well have been intended to display Lieutenant Daniel Leary at his most splendid ; certainly it had that effect . The Republic of Cinnabar Navy was the sword of the republic , not a weapon of party politics . High RCN officers could n't attend this ball because Bruno Kearnes was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RCN kept out of . The unspoken ban on attendance did n't apply to a twenty-four year old lieutenant . The fruit salad on the breast of Daniel 's Dress Whites would 've been impressive even for an admiral , however . Daniel , lately commanding the corvette Princess Cecile , had returned with dispatches from Admiral Keith 's squadron just in time to give Senator Kearnes his show . Daniel in turn was getting the kind of adulation that came to those whom the citizens of Cinnabar decided were genuine heroes . It was Lira Kearnes ' gala , but it was Daniel Leary 's night . Daniel scanned the crowd , checking for anyone he might know among those present . The invitation had been to all four officers from the Princess Cecile : Midshipmen Dorst and Vesey , and First Lieutenant Conn Medorn , who not coincidentally was the nephew of Admiral Keith . The Princess Cecile 's signals officer , Adele Mundy , had been invited also-but not because she was an RCN warrant officer . Adele was Mundy of Chatsworth , head and sole survivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her father-before his execution for treason-had been leader of the Popular Party . That was the territory if not precisely the title which Bruno Kearnes appeared to have marked for his own . Daniel did n't see any of his fellows from the Sissie , but there was plenty of room in this swirling crowd to get lost . Besides , Daniel had n't come here to find shipmates .... The small orchestra in the loft above the balcony swung into a polacca . Couples who were n't up to the lively music left the dance floor in the center of the enormous hall , but others took their place . A portly banker with investments in shipbuilding remained with the younger couples , however ; he danced with an enthusiasm that made up for his limited skills . His partner was probably closer to his granddaughter 's age than that of his daughter . She complemented the banker 's steps perfectly , just as the tiara of sapphires she wore complemented her blue eyes . And those blue eyes caught Daniel 's across the room as she dipped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here tonight . Daniel Leary could have any share of it he chose , any share , simply by stretching out his hand . He grinned : which he 'd likely do before long . He was a healthy young man , and the voyage back from the Galactic North with Admiral Keith 's dispatches had been a long one . " Leary ! " called a saturnine man in a red velvet suit ; his waistcoat flashed with metallic gold . Mawhire of Rondolet , recalled a rarely visited portion of Daniel 's mind ; an acquaintance of Daniel 's father . Mawhire 's clothing had made an impression on a child who even at seven was more comfortable hunting on the family estate than he was with the much crueler games that politicians got up to . " Daniel Leary ! Come over here , boy , and let me introduce you to some friends of mine . My but you 've grown since I last saw you ! " Which would 've been about seventeen years ago , when Speaker Corder Leary broke the Three Circles Conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mawhire had lost a cousin in the Proscriptions . ... " Daniel Leary , may I present Senator Russell-that 's Russell of Walsingham , you know ... " Mawhire said . Daniel bowed-nodded deeply-to a man with vacant eyes and more facets glittering on his fingers than there were in the crystal chandeliers above . " ... and Tomas Bayard of Bayard and Sons . " Daniel bowed again , this time to an ancient man-he supposed Bayard was male-supporting himself in a walker . Stone-faced servants stood at either elbow just in case they were needed . " Surprised to see you here , Leary , " Bayard said in a cracked voice . " Given how your father and Bruno Kearnes get along . Do n't get along . " He turned his head toward Mawhire , a quick motion that reminded Daniel of an ancient , poisonous , lizard casting for prey . " You know that story , Mawhire ? " he demanded . " I recall rumors , " Senator Mawhire said , having the decency to look uncomfortable . " But it 's not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get along because Leary and Lira Kearnes got along too well ! " Bayard continued in glee . " Far too well ! " He broke into cackling laughter ; it ended abruptly in a paroxysm of coughing . One of Bayard 's attendants held his shoulders while the other slipped a large handkerchief over his mouth . Daniel smiled pleasantly . I hope you bring your lungs up , you nasty little bastard , he thought . Aloud he said , " That would 've been before my time , sir . And of course it 's not the sort of thing a gentleman talks about . " " Gentlemen ! " Bayard sneered . " All a gentleman 's good for is feeding the worms ! " " That 's the common lot of mankind , my dear Tomas , " said a woman suddenly standing at Daniel 's right elbow . Her voice was cultured and as smoothly cutting as a scalpel . " However the lieutenant here has already accomplished things that will keep his name alive after the worms have devoured what the doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory ! " Bayard said . " Women and fools set great store by it , I understand . " He started to turn away , but stiffness and the walker prevented him from doing so quickly enough . The woman added sweetly , " I suppose women you 've had to learn about second hand , have n't you , you poor dear ? " Daniel allowed himself a satisfied smile toward the magnate 's back . He would n't have responded to Bayard directly , out of courtesy toward a sick old man-however nasty-and from the sense of propriety ingrained by living within the rigid order of the RCN . He certainly was n't displeased to watch somebody else kick the old bastard in the balls , though-and then put the boot in as he writhed on the floor . He turned to the woman . She looked to be in her thirties , but that was probably as much a medical marvel as the fact Tomas Bayard was alive at all . She was undeniably handsome , but even " the thirties " was far too old for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mawhire to the lady , " allow me to present the Lieutenant Daniel Leary of whom we 've heard so much . I 'd say Daniel was an old family friend , but in fact I ca n't claim to be any closer to Speaker Leary today than Kearnes is-or you are yourself , boy , from what I hear ? Had quite a falling out with your father when you joined the navy , I heard ? " " I have n't spoken to my father in some years , that 's true , " Daniel said , letting his eyes rise as if to view the frescos of the high ceiling . Cherubs were teasing lions in various fashions in each panel , while between the paintings were stucco moldings of furious giants straining to burst through the frames they supported . He supposed the scenes were allegorical ; another way of saying they were without interest to him . " I wonder if there 's something to dr- " " Do let me be your guide , Lieutenant , " Mistress Jacopus said , taking his right arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion nonetheless . " I have so many questions to ask you about your medals ! " The Jacopus family was famous for wealth and a determined neutrality in the Republic 's **26;826;TOOLONG very rough-politics . Daniel had heard that one member of the family was the most famous hostess in Xenos ; he did n't doubt that he 'd just met her . The orchestra was playing a hornpipe , but it was a restrained thing compared to what went by the same name in the spacers ' bars around Harbor Three-or any other RCN liberty port . Daniel had spent his time in those bars when he was a midshipman , an officer by courtesy but not yet commissioned . Since fame had brought him invitations to dos like this one , he 'd found little to regret about no longer being poor and obscure . The liquor was better and the women were much prettier . He 'd never had much interest in dancing anyway . Mistress Jacopus led him toward the refreshment table which was set in a corner , in front of double doors onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trays and bottles to replace the those that had been browsed and drunk empty . Jacopus was taking him by the long route , however , and at each step she nodded graciously and smiled to another guest . Occasionally she murmured a first name- " Dear Janni ... " - or title- " Senator , how nice , " - as they passed , savoring the looks of respect and-from some of the women-fury . " I hope you do n't mind me showing off my trophy , Lieutenant , " she said in his ear as though murmuring endearments . " Because you are quite a trophy , you know . " " Ah , mistress- " Daniel said . " Christine , please , " she said . " And you need n't worry that I 'll embarrass you later . I know quite a lot about your tastes , including the sort of young friends you prefer for recreation . I 'd offer to help you there , but I 'm sure a handsome hero like yourself is capable of making his own arrangements . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christine , " Daniel said . " And I do appreciate you , ah , helping me out of an awkwardness . " Daniel did n't like to talk about his father for a number of reasons , not least that he did n't have anything to say about Corder Leary . They 'd had little contact even before the break-which was over Corder 's remarriage , not Daniel 's career . He 'd joined the RCN in reaction to that blazing row , not as the cause of it . Daniel had spent his childhood on the family estate of Bantry , learning a little about decorum from his mother-a saint , as everybody agreed-and a great deal about hunting , fishing and manhood from Hogg , a family retainer . There 'd been Hoggs poaching on Bantry from the days of the first human settlement , long before the Hiatus in star travel drew a thousand-year line through history . In the eight years since the row , Daniel and Corder Leary 'd had no contact whatever . Words had been said that would 've meant pistols at dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even beyond that ... Corder Leary was a stiff-necked , stubborn man who 'd never backed down in a fight . Daniel was n't his father and would n't have wanted to be him ; but much as Daniel revered his late mother , he knew very well that his temper and his backbone had n't come from her side of the family . There was a crush at the refreshments table . Daniel had n't really been thirsty , just uncomfortable at the direction Mawhire had taken the conversation , and Christine Jacopus simply wanted to be seen with the lion of the evening . Instead of forcing his way through , he paused to look around again . By the etiquette of upper-class Xenos , the only regular servants on the floor were those behind the refreshments table . The guests ' personal attendants were in the balcony above . They could be summoned to meet their employer in a hallway if required or even escorted onto the floor by a member of the Kearnes household in event of an outside emergency . Many of the guests-perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by silent men and women in simple dress . If you did n't know who they were , they could pass for poor relations of the glittering guests they stayed close to . In fact they were ... well , calling them guards would be harsh but not inaccurate . They were employed by various couturiers , jewelers , and pawn brokers . They accompanied not the guests but rather the clothing and accouterments which the guests wore and had n't paid for ; that they very probably could n't pay for . By convention , nobody " noticed " them . " What is this one , Daniel ? " Christine said , touching the spray of gold feathers dusted with real rubies waving from the peak of his dress hat . She leaned against him a little more closely than she need to have done . " Oh , the aigrette ? " said Daniel , squinting sideways . " That 's the Kostroma Star , a , ah , foreign decoration . From an allied foreign power , of course , or I would n't be permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold and silver cords across his left breast was the Order of Strymon in Diamonds ; the stones on the clasp at his epaulette were the size of a child 's teeth . In theory it entitled the wearer to the freedom of Strymon , a planet Daniel did n't expect ever to visit again as an RCN officer . It was stretching the point a good deal to describe President Delos Vaughn as an ally of Cinnabar , as the events that put him in power had been not only unauthorized by Cinnabar 's Ministry of External Affairs but actively hindered by those well-meaning diplomats . Still , the award was too striking for Daniel not to wear it unless he were flatly forbidden . Foreigners had vulgar taste , far inferior to that of Cinnabar , of course . But Daniel had learned that girls-the girls he found attractive-did n't object to a bit of vulgarity ; and truth to tell , the taste of rural districts like Bantry was n't nearly as muted as that here in Xenos , the capital . Christine touched one medal after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests was forming about them like mother-of-pearl coating a sand grain in the mantle of a shellfish ; not pressing , but rapt in anticipation of what they might hear . Powerful nobles and very beautiful women , wondering what the heroic Lieutenant Leary might say ! Daniel knew it did n't matter . These same people would howl and kick his naked body down the street tomorrow if he were disgraced and executed ; they 'd done that with many of those implicated in the Three Circles Conspiracy . The folk quickest to spurn the fallen were those who 'd cheered the loudest in the days before their overthrow . It did n't matter-but he was young and he was human . " That ... " Daniel said as Christine ran the sash of red silk and cloth-of-gold between her fingers . He spoke to the older woman , but his eyes met those of the petite blonde beaming from just beyond her . " ... makes me a Royal Companion of Novy Sverdlovsk as I understand it . I was fortunate enough to recover a valuable artifact for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Galactic North as a result . " The artifact was a diamond engraved with the continents of Old Earth before the wars in which asteroids had smashed the planet out of its former shape . Daniel had traded it for a warship , and with that ship he-and the finest crew that ever blessed an RCN captain-had smashed an Alliance squadron . The sash was showy . For the same incident Admiral Keith had awarded Daniel the Medal of the Republic in Red-a small bronze cross with a ruby point in the center . Civilians marveled at the sash . RCN officers braced to attention and saluted when they saw the medal . The orchestra played a few bars as a signal . Couples began forming for a sarabande . " Now , Daniel , " Christine said , holding his right hand with her left but turning to take the hand of the blonde beside her . " May I present Thora , the daughter of my great friend Senator Bencini ? " She brought their hands together . Thora simpered becomingly ; her fingers gripped Daniel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
