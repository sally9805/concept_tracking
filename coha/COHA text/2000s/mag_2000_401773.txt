Or Consider a Padded Bra <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I had a bilateral mastectomy and reconstructive surgery in June 1990 . I am writing this letter to share my experience and encourage women to carefully consider their treatment options . <p> In hindsight , I would have elected to have no reconstruction done . The surgery took almost 15 hours , and I needed five pints of blood . Over 900 stitches were needed to detach , split , and wrap my back muscles around to the front of my chest . I nearly fainted when the sutures were removed . <p> Today , ten years later , I have no sensation of touch in my chest . The incisions remain sore , and I am unable to sleep on my stomach . I have a wonderful , compassionate , and competent physician and surgeon . But I was not prepared for the long , painful recovery , nor the unnatural look and feel of my " breasts . " <p> Also , my doctors did n't ask me about my tennis and golf games before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tennis serve hurts , and my golf swing suffers . <p> I strongly urge women to thoroughly investigate all their options after mastectomy . Talk with other women who have had various surgeries and look at photos to compare results . Weigh the pros and cons . <p> A new padded bra versus cutting up the back muscles ? In my opinion , it 's a no-brainer . This is something you will live with for the rest of your lie . Janine Black Chicago , Illinois <p> <p> Thank you for sharing your very personal story with us . <p> A comprehensive new Web site gives women instant access to medical and psychological information about breast cancer , including reconstructive surgery options . Developed by Dr. Marisa Weiss , a Philadelphia radiation oncologist specializing in breast cancer , ibreast.com features nine major sections , including Prevention , Diagnosis , and Treatment . Eat Right and Take a Multivitamin : Folic Acid Prevents Birth Defects <p> Since January 1998 , the Food and Drug Administration has required that folic acid be added to cereals , breads , pastas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , estimate that the current level of fortification will prevent only about 5 to 20 percent of folic acid-preventable birth defects of the brain and spinal cord . Dr. Godfrey P. Oakley , Jr. , professor of epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta , is at the forefront of a crusade to implement a fully protective folic acid-fortification program ( see " A Flaming Failure , " SatEvePost , Sept. /Oct. 1999 ) . The following editorial , written by Dr. Oakley , appeared in the November 11 , 1999 , New England Journal of Medicine : Prevention of Neural-Tube Defects <p> " To the Editor : Researchers reported recently that 96 women from Maine had pregnancies , with estimated or actual dates of delivery between 1991 and 1996 , in which open spina bifida or anencephaly developed in the fetuses . In addition , they found no decrease in the prevalence of these preventable birth defects . <p> " In 1991 , the Medical Research Council Vitamin Study Research Group reported the results of a randomized , controlled trial that found that synthetic folic acid taken in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bifida and anencephaly . Had an effective program of folic acid supplementation been implemented in Maine immediately after the publication of the results of the Medical Research Council vitamin study , most of the women in the study by Palomaki , et al. , would not have had pregnancies affected by these birth defects . Had there been an effective national program , 20,000 pregnancies in the United States between 1992 and 1999 would not have been affected  --  more than the number of pregnancies affected by thalidomide-induced birth defects in Europe 40 years ago . <p> " The failure to implement effective programs for protection against folic acid-preventable birth defects is causing a continuing public health emergency . Since 1991 , approximately 64 children have lost their lives because of front-seat air bags . The 20,000 pregnancies unnecessarily affected by folic acid-preventable birth defects constitute an opportunity for prevention more than 300 times as great as the opportunity to control the number of deaths among children resulting from front-seat air bags . <p> " It is not surprising that the emergency continues . The Food and Drug Administration waited four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in the average woman 's consuming only 25 percent of the amount of folic acid recommended by the Public Health Service in 1992 and the Institute of Medicine in 1998  --  a deficiency tantamount to marketing polio vaccine containing only the least common of the three vaccine strains . The current administration both permitted the inadequate fortification regulation to be formulated and failed to ask Congress to appropriate a single penny for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) to build an effective supplementation program . Congress appropriated only about $1 million for the effort , which , to be effective , would require about $100 million a year . Since the early 1990s , Congress has made approximately $100 million a year available for a CDC-sponsored program to prevent Haemophilus influenzae meningitis . We have nearly eliminated this killer and disabler of children  --  what a great public health success ! It is time for the President to implement a fully protective folic acid fortification program and , until that program is in place , for Congress to provide the CDC with the resources to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  <p>
