A proud owner of a first edition of Gravity 's Rainbow , S. L. Gilbow says that he considers Thomas Pynchon to be something of an extrovert . This story marks his first published story . ( Mr. Gilbow 's first , that is , not Pynchon 's . ) <p> LATE ONE APRIL EVENING , Linda Jackson pulled a revolver from her purse and shot her husband through a large mustard stain in the center of his T-shirt . The official after-incident survey concluded that almost all of Merry Valley approved of the shooting . Sixty-four percent of the townspeople even rated her target selection as " excellent . " A few , however , criticized her , pointing out that shooting your-husband is " a little too obvious " and " not very creative . " Dick Andrews , who had farmed the fertile soil around Merry Valley for over thirty years , believed that Larry Jackson , more than anyone else in town , needed to be killed . " I never liked him much , " he wrote in the additional comments section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good word to say about anybody . " " Excellent use of a bullet , " scrawled Jimmy Blanchard . Bom and raised in Merry Valley , he had known Larry for years and had even graduated from high school with him . " Most overbearing person I 've ever met . He deserved what he got . I 'm just not sure why it took so long . " Of course , a few people made waves . Jenny Collins seemed appalled . " I can hardly believe it , " she wrote . " We used to be much more discerning about who we killed , and we certainly did n't go around flaunting it the way Linda does . " Jenny was the old-fashioned kind . Linda would never have called her actions " flaunting it . " Of course she knew what to do after shooting Larry . She had read The Enforcement Handbook from cover to cover six times , poring over it to see if she had missed anything , scrutinizing every nuance . She had even committed some of the more important passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement - Always keep your red card in a safe , dry place-Never reveal to anyone that you have a red card-Be proud ; you 're performing an important civic duty . But flaunting it ? No , Linda blended in better than anyone in town , rarely talked and never called attention to herself . She spent most of her days at the Merry Valley Public Library , tucked between rows of antique shelves , alone , organizing a modest collection of old books . In the evening she fixed dinner . After Larry had eaten , cleaned up , and left the house for " some time alone , " Linda would lie in bed reading Jane Austen . No , Linda never flaunted anything - never had much to flaunt . After she shot her husband , Linda returned the revolver to her purse and collapsed onto her oversized couch . She then picked up the telephone , set it in her lap , and tugged at her long , pale bangs - a nervous habit that drove Larry crazy . She had once considered cutting them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street had commented on how nice they looked . " They really bring out your eyes , " Sarah had said . " They make you look as pretty as a princess . " Linda would never have called herself pretty , but she always looked as nice as she could . Her makeup - tasteful and modest - came straight out of page twenty-seven of the current issue of Truly Beautiful . She applied her eyeliner , mascara , lipstick , and blush precisely according to the instructions , copying every detail of the model 's face , framing each eye with two delicate , taupe lines . But she realized she could do no better than pass as the model 's homely cousin . Linda let go of her bangs , lifted the receiver and dialed a number from a yellow sticker plastered across the phone ; the sticker doubled as an ad for Bob 's Pizza Heaven , so she dialed carefully . " Merry Valley Police Department . " " I 'd like to report an enforcement , " said Linda . " Linda ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " This is Officer Hamilton . " " Oh , thank goodness , " she said , unable to hide her relief . She admired Officer Hamilton . Once , while making his usual patrol through Merry Valley , he had pulled over to help her carry two bags of groceries , heavy with the dead weight of frozen meat and canned vegetables . He was probably just fighting boredom , but she still appreciated the help . You rarely found that kind of service anymore . Linda paused , wondered what tone to strike , and settled on matter-offact . " I 've just shot someone . The Enforcement Handbook says I 'm supposed to call you . " " That 's right , " said Officer Hamilton . " Chapter Three , I think . Who did you shoot ? " " My husband . " " Is he dead ? " he asked . Linda studied Larry , sensitive to any movement , the slightest twitch . " He 's not moving . " she said . " He has n't moved since I shot him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Once , " she said . " I 'd recommend you shoot him one more time just to be sure , " said Officer Hamilton . " No , " said Linda , " I 'm sure he 's dead enough . " The Enforcement Handbook recommended at least two shots , but the thought of shooting Larry again bothered Linda . The first shot had n't been easy , in spite of what the handbook said . " Fine then , but you 'll need to come down to the station to fill out the paperwork . " " Of course , " she said . " Do I need to call someone to pick him up ? " The handbook had n't mentioned how to remove the body . " We 'll take care of that , " said Officer Hamilton . " Just come down to the station and do n't forget to bring your red card . You do have a red card , do n't you ? " " I do , " she said . " Wonderful , " said Officer Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , paraphrasing a portion from chapter two of the handbook . " And any spare ammunition you did n't use , " said Officer Hamilton . " We can reissue it with the card . " Linda hung up , set the phone on the floor , and rose from the couch . She looked at Larry , and the longer she looked at him the more she expected him to move ; it seemed so unnatural for him to be so still , so silent - he had always been in motion . Early in their courtship she pictured him as a hummingbird - a large , gawky hummingbird - but lately she saw him as something else - perhaps a mongoose . " Larry , " she said without taking her eyes off him . She wondered if she should follow Officer Hamilton 's advice and shoot him again . But there was no movement , no sound . She thought he looked like he was asleep , but then she remembered the constant rolling and snoring that marked his nights . No second shot would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped around Larry 's body , crossed the living room and passed through the spare bedroom into the bathroom . Linda filled the sink with warm water , adding a delightful mixture of strawberry and watermelon soap . The crimson color had never bothered her before , but now she braced herself as she plunged her hands into the water . She scrubbed her hands for more than a minute ; it seemed like the right thing to do . After she dried her hands on a monogrammed towel , Linda went to her bedroom . Larry and Linda referred to it as the " spare bedroom , " but it was the one room Linda had all to herself , her refuge from Larry when he gut wild-even wilder than usual . The room became her sanctuary , and Larry rarely entered it . Not that Linda forbade him to do so . It was just that Linda had filled it with things that made him uncomfortable . A large fourposter bed dominated the center of the room . On top of the bed were a handmade quilt , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry had given to Linda years ago . Linda called the animal " Sally Cat " but lately had considered the possibility that it might be a ferret . Beside the bed stood an antique vanity bordered by two windows , each framed with lace curtains adorned with a delicate tea rose pattern . The room radiated Linda ; there was little about Larry in it . Linda scanned her closet and filtered through a row of clothes she had worn only once - a wedding dress , a pink prom dress , and an evening gown . She finally settled on a gathered lavender dress . She had once worn it to The Merry Valley Bistro , the one restaurant in town Linda looked forward to . Larry criticized her for being overdressed , and she had n't worn the dress since . But tonight it seemed right - the lavender dress and a matching pair of high-heeled shoes . Linda was n't sure who might be at the police station , but crowds had a way of forming in Merry Valley , and she wanted to be presentable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chance of Larry objecting . " When she finished dressing , Linda gathered the red card , the government revolver , and the last two rounds of ammunition , and dropped them into her purse . She checked her makeup in the vanity mirror and then , deciding she was in no mood to drive , called a taxi . She opened the front door , paused , and surveyed the living room one last time . " Damn it , Larry , " she said . " I gave you fair warning . " LINDA STEPPED into the dark night of a new moon . Her outdoor light had burned out weeks ago , but the porch light on Sarah Hall 's house across the street blazed like a beacon , allowing Linda to navigate her steps safely . Sarah , swaying in time to a big band tune coming from her living room , deadheaded flowers that grew in large pots that framed her house . She was a large , nocturnal woman with a strong jaw and an unmistakable silhouette . As Linda neared the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly wave . Linda wished she had n't been noticed , but if she had to deal with anyone tonight , besides the police which at this point seemed inevitable - it might as well be Sarah . Linda liked Sarah and believed Sarah liked her too . She liked the way Sarah complimented her bangs ; she liked the cheesecakes Sarah occasionally brought over ; she liked her sisterly advice . Often Linda would call Sarah when Larry acted up . " You should get help , " Sarah would say . Linda would agree and then tell her how she was starting to get things under control , how she and Larry were going to work things out with just a little more time , but Linda knew that the time needed to work things out with Larry was most aptly measured in geological terms . Linda stopped between two small pear trees to wait for the taxi . She stooped under one and felt the soil-she would need to water it tomorrow . Larry had purchased the trees on the way back from their honeymoon five years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that week . Larry had surprised her with a Caribbean cruise , although Linda thought they had decided to go to New York . They spent two days in the Bahamas , but Linda refused to count it as one of the places she had actually visited since she never left the ship . " You ever been on a cruise before ? " Larry asked as they entered their suite . The question surprised Linda . Surely they had discussed cruises in the five months they had known each other . She thought for a moment , but no such conversation came to mind . " No , " she said , " this will be my first time . " " You 're going to love it here , " he said . But she did n't . Within two hours she was heaving into the toilet . " You should give it more of a chance , " Larry said . " I 'll try , " she said . " It 's all in your attitude . " " I think I 'm feeling a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Then she grabbed the rim of the toilet and vomited again . Larry spent the rest of their honeymoon pacing the ship 's deck . Occasionally , between doses of Dramamine , Linda would look out the cabin window . She had never seen so much water . Larry refused to join her , refused to eat with her , refused to talk to her . He had decided to boycott any activity that included Linda . Linda stood under the pear tree until the taxi arrived . As it pulled over , Sarah dropped her pruning sheers and dashed across the street . " Sarah , I would love to talk but I need to go . " " I would say so . " Sarah opened the taxi door and slid into the back seat ; she waved for Linda to join her . Linda crawled in . " Just tell me , dear , " said Sarah , " why did you shoot him ? " " Where to ? " asked the driver . " The police station , " said Linda . The taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the simple homes of Merry Valley slipped by . She felt Sarah 's strong hands grab her arm and pull her close . " Now do n't you worry , " said Sarah . " You 're not worried , are you ? " " A little , " admitted Linda . " There 's nothing to it . Really . I had a cousin once who used a red card , and he said it was the easiest thing he ever did . " " Who 'd he use it on ? " asked Linda . " I do n't remember . It 's been years . At least five and it was n't around here . " " He said it was easy ? " " I think he shot a speeder . He always hated careless drivers . " Linda buried her face into the fat flesh of Sarah 's right arm . She wanted to cry . The handbook had mentioned this - Shooter 's Regret . It will pass , the handbook stated , just trust your decision , trust your instincts . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cousin , " said Sarah . " He would yell at people all the time . Yell at them for going too slow , for going too fast , for cutting him off . I was n't surprised when I heard he had used a red card . " " It was n't easy , " said Linda . " Think he got an award for it . Used the card the same week he got it . A lot of people like to see the cards circulate . Lets more people take part in the system . " " How 'd you know I used a red card ? " " Why , dear , I heard it on the radio . They broke into Phil 's Follies . There 's nothing as exciting as one of the cards being used . " " I guess , " said Linda . She did n't mind excitement ; she just did n't want the excitement to revolve around her . By the time Linda and Sarah arrived at the police station , a small crowd had already gathered . Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , dear , you ready for this ? " Linda nodded . " You stay by me , " she snapped with authority . Linda pulled in close for protection . Linda recognized several faces in the crowd - Jerry Miles , Freddy Nevers , and Ann Davidson . She knew them well enough to carry on casual conversation at The Happy Druggist-Jerry 's store-or Mel 's Fill " Em Up where Freddy and Ann worked . There were also half a dozen people not quite as familiar to her , but she had seen them all around town at one time or another . Freddy Nevers called her name , and Jerry Miles even shouted a little encouragement : " Way to go ! " Deputy Williams met Linda and Sarah at the entrance to the police station and escorted them to the reception counter . At one point , Jerry , excited at having his monotonous evening livened up a little , dashed toward Linda to congratulate her , but Deputy Williams reached out and shoved him back . Linda gave the deputy an appreciative glance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought . Barry Giles , lead reporter for Channel Seven , moved as close to Linda as he could , microphone in hand , ready to broadcast the details to all of Merry Valley . " How did it happen , Mrs. Jackson ? " he called out . Linda started to answer , but the deputy interrupted in a low forceful voice he saved for his most serious duties . " There 'll be time for that later . " Officer Hamilton was waiting for Linda behind a mahogany reception desk . Linda pulled a revolver out of her purse and laid it gently in front of him . After Officer Hamilton confirmed the revolver to be official government property , the crowd , giving Linda some space out of politeness while inching forward out of curiosity , waited for the inevitable . Linda reached into her purse and pulled out the red card . The card did n't seem special . It was small , only half the size of a postcard , with rounded corners and a smooth edge . The one mark on it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Barry . " Killed by a librarian with a red card , " said Jerry . " That 's got to be embarrassing . " " I knew she had it , " said a voice Linda did n't recognize . " Like hell you did , " came a muffled response . Officer Hamilton slid the card under an electronic reader and , with a nod , confirmed its authenticity . " How long you been holding it ? " asked someone from the crowd . Officer Hamilton checked the reading . " Four years , " he said , impressed at Linda 's self-restraint . The crowd nodded its approval . " My goodness , " said Barry . " Most of the other tickets have been circulating a lot faster than that . " " Sure have , " said Officer Hamilton . " How long have they been out ? " Barry asked . " A couple have been out for almost a year and one for about nine months . I 'm not sure about the other two . I 'd have to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back into circulation , " someone said . The crowd hummed with excitement . Officer Hamilton led Linda away from the crowd . Linda glanced back at Sarah who signaled that she would be in the waiting room , an unimpressive area set off by gray partitions . It contained little more than four chairs , a television dangling from the ceiling , and two ash trays . " Thanks , " mouthed Linda . They ended up in a small , secluded room in the back of the station . Linda took her place in a wooden chair behind an aging table . On a corner shelf stood a drip coffeepot containing the last few drops after a long day . Officer Hamilton held up a Styrofoam cup . " Coffee ? Looks like there 's enough for one more cup . " " No thanks , " said Linda . She could have actually used a cup of coffee , but not from that pot . Officer Hamilton sat in the chair across from Linda . " Well , " he said , " The enforcement is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " finished Linda , quoting the handbook . " This is the hard part , is n't it ? " " There 's no hard part , " he said . " It 's all easy . " He smiled , placed an official-looking form on the table and put on a pair of bifocals . He read the form quickly to himself , vocalizing a few key phrases , orienting himself on how to proceed . " Are you ready ? " he finally asked . Linda nodded . " What is your name ? " Linda gave him a " you 've got to be kidding me " look . " These are standard questions , Linda . Just humor me . " " Linda Jackson . " " Gender ? " Linda did n't even answer . " Female , " said Officer Hamilton in response to his own question . " Marital Status ? " " Widowed , " said Linda . " Oh yes , " he said . " That 's kind of why we 're here , is n't it . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " In my living room . " " Why did you execute the enforcement ? " " Is that important ? " asked Linda . " We track these things for statistical purposes . " " I think the real question should be why did n't I do it sooner . " " Why did n't you ? You 've had the red card for almost four years . " " I do n't know . At first I did n't want to use it because then I would n't have one . But later it just became a challenge . " " A challenge ? " " Sometimes he would egg me on , dare me to use it . " " He knew you had a red card ? " Linda was n't sure how to answer this . She knew she was n't supposed to tell Larry about the red card . " Just answer honestly , " said Officer Hamilton . " You have nothing to worry about . You performed an enforcement while in possession of a valid red card . That 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help us improve the program . " " He knew , " said Linda . " He 's known for years . It was a mistake to tell him because then he would test me . It was like Russian roulette . " Officer Hamilton made a quick note . " Is that all right ? Am I in trouble ? " " Well , some people view it as having an unfair advantage over other citizens . But in this case it does n't seem to have made a difference . " " But it should have made a difference . " Linda looked at Officer Hamilton and wondered if she was getting through to him . She wanted to tell him how things were supposed to be different , how they were supposed to get better , slowly , incrementally , but better . Her plans were never to kill Larry but to keep him alive , to keep him alive forever . " It should have made a big difference , " she said . " He knew I had a card . " " Had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . He always seemed ta be going someplace . " " Why did you shoot him ! " asked Officer Hamilton , trying the question one more time . " I really do n't know , " said Linda . " I think I just snapped ? " " Linda , " he said . His eyes narrowed . " People with red cards are allowed to snap . It 's their duty to snap . " Officer Hamilton pressed on with questions for almost half an hour . How did you feel ? Where did you keep your card ? Did the handbook prepare you for your role as an enforcer ? Linda answered as best she could , but she was ready for it all to end . Finally , Officer Hamilton put down his pencil . " That 's it , " he said . " Really ? " " That was n't so bad was it ? " " Not too bad . Anything else ? " " Just a word of advice , " said Officer Hamilton . " If you ever get another red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even know who has them . The program is random and anonymous . That 's what makes it work . If you start taking those factors out , the program loses its effectiveness . " " Of course , " she said , a little embarrassed at having made such a careless mistake . OFFICER HAMILTON released Linda and led her to the hallway out . " Do you need a ride ? " he asked . " I 'll go back with Sarah , " she said . " I could use a restroom though . " In the restroom , Linda checked herself in the minor . Her lipstick had faded from the right side of her upper lip , and black mascara crept up toward her eyebrow . Her blush had cracked except for the glow on her nose . The night had been hard on her face ; she looked old and tired . She freshened her lipstick , brushed her hair , and killed the shine on her nose . It seemed futile . She would need to check Truly Beautiful for a look that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the long hall to join Sarah in the waiting area . She paused at the end of the hall , dwarfed by the partitions that separated the waiting area from the rest of the police station . She could hear voices , several of them , mingling , Sarah 's dominant among them . Linda looked above the partition and saw a small television , muted and pathetic , hanging from the ceiling . The television 's color had shifted long ago , and a bald , blue man in a sweater dispensed advice . She thought she might have seen him before . He seemed vaguely familiar . Was his name Richard ? She was n't sure , but he seemed like a Richard to her . Maybe it was n't advice ; he could be warning her about something , some disaster , some great flood . " Well I know what I 'll do if I get the card next , " she heard Jerry Miles say . " Shoot yourself ? " asked Freddy Nevers . " Never mind , I just changed my plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get a card , let me know , " said Sarah . " You tend to live a lot longer if you know who has the cards . " Richard now held a green spray bottle . He was selling something . Of course . Why advise or warn when you can sell ? Linda decided to wait until the conversation settled down a little more before joining Sarah . Conversations tended to die once Linda entered into them . " I never know who has the cards , " said Jerry . " I try to make it my business , " said Sarah . " I try to make everything my business . " She spit out the words as if they were rehearsed . Richard , energetic and passionate now , waved the bottle about in his left hand . He held up a shirt and sprayed it . Linda moved closer to the television , but she could n't tell if the spray had any effect . Richard sprayed the bottle on the floor and then on himself . He was obviously proud of its versatility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy his product . She needed it . She needed to have what he was selling . " What about Linda ? " asked Jerry . " I 've known Linda for years , " said Sarah . " Her husband too . " " I knew her , " said Freddy . " But not like I knew her , dear . " Linda hated to interrupt ; Sarah seemed to be enjoying herself . She wondered what it would be like to enjoy yourself . Linda continued to watch the commercial , one of those long ones , one of those that could go on for five minutes . Richard had toned down the sell and appeared to be whispering , enunciating every word . He had two bottles now , one cradled under each arm , and he was talking to Linda , directly to Linda , only to Linda . " Well , she shops at my store , " said Jerry . " Buys a lot of makeup . Careful shopper . Always did like her . " " Sweetheart , you have to like someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kind of dangerous not to . " " How would I have known she had a red card ? " asked Jerry . " I knew , " said Sarah . " You knew she had a red card ? " " Of course she had the card . " " I suspected , but I was never sure , " said a voice Linda did n't recognize . He seemed to be acting more important than he actually was . " I 've known it for years . I 'm surprised you all did n't know . " Sarah paused for effect . " Oh , I forgot , you all were n't sleeping with her husband ? " The crowd laughed . " Well , I guess I wo n't have to like her anymore , " said Sarah . Richard made his final plea . Under him flashed a phone number , barely legible , followed by the words , " Miracle Madness , for when clean is n't clean enough . " Linda listened for the conversation to continue , but it had stalled . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found a phone near the ladies restroom , and called the toll-free number . " I want to place an order , " said Linda . " Which product ? " " Miracle Madness . " " Oh , you are going to love it . And with that you get Miracle Madness Plus . " After Linda had provided her billing information , she joined Sarah and the others in the waiting room . " Sarah , " she said as she rounded the partition , " I 'm all done now . " " Wonderful , " said Sarah . " You 've had a hard day and it 's time to get you home . " When the taxi dropped them off at Linda 's place well after midnight , Sarah was in full motion , feeding off the energy of the evening . Linda had been quiet during the drive home , but she did n't need to speak since Sarah had rambled on without stopping . Sarah had pretty well resolved most of Linda 's problems . She had told her how to improve her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your entire life . She had told her how to improve her looks - those bangs just have to go , they do absolutely nothing for you . She had told her how to improve her general disposition - you have got to stop moping about . Finally Linda asked , " What do I do now ? " " What do you mean ? " " The handbook never talked about this part . I do n't know what to do next . " " Well , " said Sarah , " tomorrow we need to plan Mr. Jackson 's funeral . I guess that would be next . " " Of course , " said Linda . " Then we bury him , and then you get on with your life . " " We need to plan a funeral , " said Linda . " Now do n't be afraid to call if you need anything , " said Sarah as they entered the house . " Really . Anything at all . " " Anything ? " " Absolutely . Whatever you need . " " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stay with me ? " Linda nodded . " At my house ? " " For a while . At least a day or two . Longer if I could . " " You really need to get back on your feet , " said Sarah . " This is your home and it does n't do any good to run from it . This is your place . " " My place , " said Linda . She stood over the spot where Larry had lain . Now that he was gone , the room seemed much more open , almost cavernous . Sarah joined her . " Is this it ? " she asked . " He fell right here next to the coffee table , " replied Linda . " They really are quite efficient . The enforcement program is run so well . " " It is , " agreed Linda , noticing that even the blood had been cleaned up . All that remained was a small stain , barely noticeable , no worse than the tea spill on the other side of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , the tea , everything . After all , Miracle Madness was on its way . " I can stay for a bit , " said Sarah , turning on the television . She folded onto the couch , pried her shoes off , and clicked through channels looking for the television version of Phil 's Follies . " Stay for as long as you can , " said Linda . " I 'll be with you in a moment . After I change . " The lavender dress was beginning to weigh on her . In her bedroom , Linda slipped off her high heels and set them in her closet . She then pulled off her dress and hung it neatly on a padded hanger . She lay down on her bed , closed her eyes , and folded her hands over her face . She exhaled , bathing her eyes and nose in the warmth of her own breath . She opened her mouth and made a guttural sound that echoed off her cupped hands . She rolled onto her stomach , grabbed her stuffed cat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a cat . No , a ferret , she would rather be a ferret . Linda slid off the bed and crouched on her hands and knees , almost feral . She could sleep here . She could sleep on the carpet once it was clean . That would be soon ; Miracle Madness was coming . " When clean is n't clean enough , " she moaned . Linda reached under the bed and felt around blindly . She pulled out a shoe box adorned with a lavender bow - a beautiful bow she had tied nine months earlier . She loved tying bows and she was proud of this one , bold and perfectly proportioned . Lavender - she loved lavender . Linda untied the bow and carefully slid the ribbon off the box . She opened the box , pulled out a red card and a small revolver , and finally cried for the first time that night .
