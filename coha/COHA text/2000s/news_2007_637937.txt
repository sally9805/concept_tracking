<p> Three-year-old Nicole carefully arranges beige , fringed cloth napkins at each place setting on a small wooden table . Five-year-old Maria totes a tiny colander and a child-sized pair of tongs , announcing , " Spaghetti for dinner and cherry pie for dessert ! " Nicole pours mugs of pretend lemonade . <p> The two commence eating their pretend feast , passing bread , welcoming guests , and making salads , cookies , and cakes . <p> It 's a typical kindergarten scene at the Pine Hill Waldorf School here : pretending ... imagining ... experimenting with arts and crafts . In a word : playing . <p> " Play is a basic human drive , " says David Elkind , author of " The Power of Play . " " It is simply a shorthand for imagination , curiosity , and fantasy - our creative dispositions . " Dr. Elkind is perhaps best known for writing " The Hurried Child " in 1981 . <p> This tall , thin , tanned man frowns when he thinks about the future of play in our society . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The not-so-subtle message these days is that play is superfluous . And if you are going to play , you may as well learn something at the same time . " <p> But this overlooks the vital role of play in human development , Elkind says . Through play , children create new learning experiences . These self-created moments enA-A-able children to acquire social , emotional , and intellectual skills and grasp concepts they ca n't acquire any other way , he maintains . <p> " If , for example infants did not engage in self-initiated playful babble , they would never learn to speak , " Elkind says . <p> Yet the concept of " unstructured , self-initiated play " is vanishing from our culture . <p> Computers , TV , a plethora of organized activities , electronic toys , and mounting pressure to excel academically at a much earlier age are just some of the influences changing the way children interact with each other and the world around them . <p> " Over the past two decades , children have lost 12 hours of free time a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This includes " eight hours of unstructured play and outdoor activities . " <p> This time has been supplanted by organized and more sedentary activities . " The time children spend in organized sports has doubled , and the number of minutes children devote to a passive spectator activity ... not including television ... has gone from 30 minutes to more than three hours a week , " Elkind continues . <p> Even schools contribute to this scarcity of playtime : Some have eliminated recess in favor of more time in the classroom . <p> " The pressures on kids today also constrain their ability to play and use their imaginations , " says Elkind . Kindergartens , which were once dedicated to children 's learning through play , have become mini- first grades , focused upon academic learning , including testing and homework . <p> During his 50-year tenure as a professor of child development at Tufts University in Medford , Mass. , Elkind has seen this change affect his students . " Many young people today do n't know how to play , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have had little time or opportunity to engage in self-A-initiated activities . <p> Some children must learn how to play <p> Lisa Freeman , a Waldorf kindergarten teacher for 17 years , agrees . " Not everyone who comes to our kindergarten can play at first , " she says . " They can not act out their own ideas . " One of her first responsibilities at the beginning of each school year is to help develop the children 's innate ability to do just that . <p> Ms. Freeman describes a typical experience : " Groups of children were deeply engaged in building a houseboat , draping big cloths over wooden play stands , " she says . " A boy was roaming from one group to the other , and suddenly he pulled down the wall of the boat , creating great indignation . " The children repaired it , but he kept doing it . <p> At story time , which is told without books or pictures , this same boy could not sit still or be quiet , perhaps because he was not able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him aside . Using a stuffed cat , some blocks , and a cloth , she created a story that he could see , about a kitten looking for a friend to play with . The kitten met a mouse , but scared him away with his claws ... At first the story mirrored the boy 's frustration , but it finished with a happy resolution . " I looked for opportunities every day , all day , to feed him stories that might prompt behavior modification rather than direct it , " says Freeman . Eventually , the boy entered the world of imagination where everything dreamed becomes possible and - in his case , he became a good friend . <p> How play evolves <p> True play is self-initiated , says Elkind , such as the kindergarten children playing restaurant , described above . <p> Play takes different forms at different age levels . The babbling of infants , the dramatic play of preschoolers , and the simple games with rules ( hopscotch , hide-and-seek , etc . ) . Through these activities , children learn about themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play in terms of emotional development , too : " Through imagination and interaction , children learn a passionate and compassionate respect for each other and the spiritual world around them . " <p> One of her students insisted on putting Band-Aids on all the students . This boy rescuer was learning the importance of showing other kids that they could trust him - and building confidence that he really could help others . " Through imaginative play , " Freeman says , " the children become empowered . They build self-confidence . " <p> Role-playing is especially good for this . " Children are basically powerless , " says Elkind . By pretending they are a train engineer or police officer , they can play the powerful adult and this provides a reprieve . <p> Lack of playfulness hurts academics <p> Fifteen major university teams from the United States recently competed in an international mathematics competition . Only one of the US teams won . <p> Elkind feels this is a consequence that students are not as playful as they once were . <p> " Fantasy , curiosity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ math and science , " says Elkind . " The failure to develop these tools through play is , in part at least , one of the reasons America is falling behind other countries in attracting young people into these fields . " <p> Children also learn to socialize via play . <p> This past spring , when the pump-well was opened in the play yard of the Waldorf School here , the water gushed forth . Children were building dams , streams , ponds , and having a great time - except for one child . <p> " He is an only child , and he was feeling rejected ... not knowing how to join the others , " says Freeman . " So he ran after the others saying things like , ' That was my bucket ! Now it 's my turn ! ' " <p> But this was n't getting him anywhere , so finally he stopped and thought . He looked at the wash bucket , and then called , " I have an idea ... a great idea ! " Everyone came running . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time - everyone 's effort was turned toward the same cause . <p> Instead of continuing to pester the others , this boy came up with his own idea , which included other children . In this creative , constructive way he became a part of the group . <p> " Epiphanies like this happen every day through play . And this is an experience that will build inner confidence and a sense of community in children that can serve them for a lifetime , " says Freeman . <p> Opportunities for spontaneous play <p> There is certainly a place for organized sports , cultural activities like scouts or dance lessons , TV , and computers . <p> " It 's not that those things are n't valuable , " says Elkind . But things like soccer " should n't dominate a child 's life , or else the fun sport becomes work , and by the time a child is 13 or 14 , they are burned out . " <p> Children need several hours each day to be kids , Elkind says . They need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invent on their own , with other kids , with parents , or other caregivers . <p> Much more learning takes place outside the classroom than within it , Elkind maintains . And down time , even driving in a car provides wonderful opportunities for spontaneous play with our children , he adds . He was driving in the car with his 5-year-old granddaughter , who was getting bored . Elkind suggested that they count the number of " For Sale " signs . This became a game . When she asked , " What does ' For Sale ' mean ? " the game became an opportunity for her to practice counting and learn a new phrase . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2007 . The Christian Science Monitor
