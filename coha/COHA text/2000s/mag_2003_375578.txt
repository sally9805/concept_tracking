When Sean Slattery , 17 , looks at a page of text , he can see the letters . He can tell you the letters ' names . He can even tell you what sounds those letters make . But it often takes a while for the articulate high school student from Simi Valley , Calif. , to tell you what words those letters form . " I see a wall , " he says . " I see a hurdle I have to get over . " Some words are easier for Sean to figure out than others . " I can get longer words , like electricity , " he says . " But I have trouble with shorter words , like four or year . " <P> Slattery has dyslexia , a reading disorder that persists despite good schooling and normal or even above-average intelligence . It 's a handicap that affects up to 1 in 5 schoolchildren . Yet the exact nature of the problem has eluded doctors , teachers , parents and dyslexics themselves since it was first described more than a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers to imagine what it 's like not to be able to effortlessly absorb the printed word that they often suspect the real problem is laziness or obstinacy or a proud parent 's inability to recognize that his or her child is n't that smart after all . <P> The mystery  --  and perhaps some of the stigma  --  may finally be starting to lift . The more researchers learn about dyslexia , the more they realize it 's a flaw not of character but of biology  --  specifically , the biology of the brain . No , people with dyslexia are not brain damaged . Brain scans show their cerebrums are perfectly normal , if not extraordinary . Dyslexics , in fact , seem to have a distinct advantage when it comes to thinking outside the box . <P> But a growing body of scientific evidence suggests there is a glitch in the neurological wiring of dyslexics that makes reading extremely difficult for them . Fortunately , the science also points to new strategies for overcoming the glitch . The most successful programs focus on strengthening the brain 's aptitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More later on why that matters . ) Some studies suggest that the right kinds of instruction provided early enough may rewire the brain so thoroughly that the neurological glitch disappears entirely . <P> The new science may even be starting to change public policy . When the U.S. government launched an education initiative in 2001 called No Child Left Behind , its administrators made clear that their funding would go only to reading programs that are based on solid evidence of the sort that has been uncovered in dyslexia research . " In education , the whole idea that there is evidence that some programs are more effective than others is new , " says Dr. Sally Shaywitz , a Yale neuroscientist who has written a fascinating new book , Overcoming Dyslexia ( Alfred A. Knopf ; April 2003 ) , that details the latest brain-scan research  --  much of it done in her lab . " The good news is we really understand the steps of how you become a reader and how you become a skilled reader , " she says .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
