Harness the power of flowing water for clean , sustainable home electricity . // Home-scale hydroelectric power systems offer an opportunity for humans to forge an intelligent and sustainable partnership with sunshine , rain and running water . Sometimes dubbed " microhydro , " this approach uses low-impact mechanical systems to harness moving water to generate clean , reliable electric power . Unlike the intermittent power from wind or solar systems , hydroelectric power can flow night and day from yearround streams . A hydroelectric system converts the force from flowing water into electricity . You take the kinetic energy of water flowing downhill from a stream or river and direct it onto a wheel in a turbine that converts the rotational energy to electricity . The amount of power produced depends on the volume of water flowing onto the turbine and the vertical distance it falls through the system . Equipment costs range from about $1,000 for the smallest , to $20,000 for a system large enough to power several modern homes . " Many microhydro systems generate 75 to 350 kilowatt hours ( kWh ) per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microhydro : Clean Power from Water , a new title in the MOTHER EARTH NEWS " Books for Wiser Living " series . Davis is a renewable energy developer with decades of microhydro experience . In fact , it 's his life 's work , and he 's gathered all his knowledge , experience and enthusiasm into this concise , easy-to-understand manual . His book covers the entire subject , from the essentials of site selection to the nitty-gritty of hardware choices and installation . THE BASICS To implement a successful microhydro system , you will need the following basic requirements : * At least 2 gallons pet minute of flowing watet , and a lot of drop ; or 2 feet of drop and 500 gallons pet minute of watet flow . * A proper turbine , alternator and shelter from bad weather . * Permission from the relevant authorities , even if the project is entirely on your own land . * A water intake and enough pipeline or " penstock " to divert water to the turbine and return it to the stream . * A transmission line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of use . * Batteries and a power inverter subsystem to convert the electricity to an alternating current ( AC ) , and a controller for the electrical system . Photograph Scott Davis , author of Microhydm : Clean Power from Water , has decades of experience with microhydro technology . Beside him a stream flows at about 20 gallons per minute - just the right size for a small microhydro system . // SITE ASSESSMENT If you 're lucky enough to have an abundance of flowing water , you may be tempted to envision projects that are larger than what is normally required . Davis stresses that you should plan to produce only the power you need , not the maximum amount possible . If you do n't have an obvious microhydro location - but you still have access to running water - you still may be able to set up a system . In its simplest form , the energy potential of flowing water depends on its flow rate ( usually measured in gallons per minute ) multiplied by the pressure behind that flow ( related to the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business ) . Davis recommends a multistep approach to assess your microhydro potential before buying any equipment . Accurate site assessment is key because it identifies the total energy potential that 's available , and it all begins with a measurement of water-volume flow rates . " Most microhydro systems use between 2 and 1,000 gallons of water per minute , " Davis says . " If you have a spring or very small creek , the amount of available water may be the factor that limits your power output . " One of the ways to find the total amount of available water , Davis says , is to use the " container method . " Find a spot where the potential stream 's water enters a culvert and time how long it takes to fill up a container of a known size . The stream 's flow in gallons per minute equals the size of the container in gallons divided by the time it takes to fill in seconds , times 60 . For example , if a 5-gallon bucket fills up in 10 seconds , the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next , you need information on the pressure behind that flow , which relates to the amount of vertical drop the water undergoes as it travels through your site . Pressure measurement combines with flow rate to determine the raw energy potential of a location . In turn , this defines the universe of choices for the hardware necessary to produce the electricity you need at wall sockets , light fixtures and appliances . Flow rate multiplied by pressure equals power . You wo n't get very far in the microhydro adventure before you realize something important : There 's more to a good system than just flowing water . You also are dealing with terrestrial conditions , and that 's why creating a stream profile is essential and should be the third factor to consider when choosing your optimum site . " A completed stream profile sounds something like this , " Davis says . " The first 100 feet drops 20 feet . The second 100 feet are not as steep , and drops 16 feet , and so on . " What you 're aiming for is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how those characteristics can be used to good advantage in your plans . By using a surveyor 's transit , a water level or a laser level , you can produce a side-view profile - or cross-section - of the entire stream landscape as water runs from pipeline intake to output port . A stream profile also helps you determine the best location for the waterintake end of the pipe . This is where most of your regular maintenance will happen ( cleaning out brush and stream debris , for instance ) , so you need to choose a spot with easy access , if possible . Also , if the flow rate of your stream is more than a few gal- , lons per minute , you may find J several possible locations for the turbine itself . The stream profile often makes it easier to identify optimal turbine placement , which usually consists of a stable water level , accessibility and water relatively free from debris . Another important consideration is to place the turbine in an area where it wo n't be affected by freezing water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect it from the environment .

Top : This Pelton turbine generates power when the jet of water strikes the cupped runner along its circumference . // Most microhydro installations include a pipeline that diverts water over land down from an area of high elevation , connecting to an enclosed water wheel ( that 's the turbine ) at some lower level . This situation raises key questions : Will a 2-inch-diameter pipe give you the best energy potential in relation to the cost of the material and its flow rate ? How does this compare with a 4-inch pipe ? Will your energy expectations be met with a 500-foot pipeline , or do you need a 1,000-foot pipe to get more head ( water pressure ) ? How will flow volume , vertical drop and friction in the pipe affect the amount of power generated ? All these questions are important because they each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cites one case study where variations in pipe size , flow rate and static head yielded a 350-percent output difference across the four options examined . THE HARDWARE Most people who choose hydropower are attracted to the fascinating variety of unusual hardware that makes clean , lowcost electricity . Turbines complete the first part of the energy-conversion process , and in many ways , they 're the heart of any hydropower system . Many designs are available , but most include some kind of fanlike wheel on a shaft - set within a metal case that contains and directs water flow to spin the blades . Turbines are designed for both low- and high-pressure applications . High-head impulse turbines are the most versatile - used for situations with heads ranging from 6 to 600 feet - and can generate enough power to sustain most any requirement given the right conditions . The Turgo impulse turbine uses a jet of water to strike the enclosed water wheel at an angle . Because the impulse turbine uses more water , significant power can be generated with less head , which may result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water to strike the enclosed water wheel along its circumference , which can be slightly more efficient than the Turgo turbine , Davis says , and is used especially for low-flow , highhead situations . Low-head turbines are meant for heads under 10 or 12 feet . These turbines are ideal candidates to charge batteries a long way from the powerhouse at low expense . The LH-IOOO - made by Energy Systems and Design - will produce power from as little as 2 feet of head , and the Powerpal - made by Asian Phoenix Resources - is a complete small-scale AC system . Constructing your own microhydro system also can be a viable option . Many different methods can be good alternatives to purchasing commercially produced turbines and alternators , but the efficiency and effectiveness of a homemade system depends much on its design . A centrifugal pump can be made into a backward-running Francis turbine ( in which water flows through the turbine runner ) ; an induction motor can be used as an alternator ; and a crossflow turbine can be fabricated with readily available materials common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ www.other power.com for ideas on how to make homemade systems . The electrical side of any hydropower facility always includes a device to convert the mechanical energy of a spinning shaft into electrical energy ( either a generator for direct current or an alternator for AC ) . That electrical energy is then sent through a series of components called the " balance of system " equipment , which saves and regulates the electricity once it 's generated . But before you tackle the electrical side of hydropower , you need to understand something about the two basic types of electricity : direct current ( DC ) and AC . DC is the sort of electricity delivered by a battery . Imagine a whole bunch of electrons piled up against one pole of a battery , desperately trying to get to the other pole . When you close the circuit across both poles , energy flows in one direction and can spin a motor or light a bulb in the process . DC electricity is more complicated to generate than AC , and it travels less efficiently . That said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes it more useful for small hydropower applications that need to build up a stockpile of energy to meet large intermittent loads . AC is the type you get from the grid ; just think about it as a series of rising and falling voltage waves . In a typical grid-delivered power system , this riseand-fall cycle happens 60 times a second . Most appliances are designed to run on AC power only . Smaller hydropower systems might include a series of deep-cycle batteries for storing DC energy for intermittent high demand , though having a DC foundation to your system does n't necessarily rule out the option of AC output , as well . The secret is something called an inverter . " These convert directcurrent battery power ( DC ) into the kind of alternating current ( AC ) that we 're all familiar with , " Davis says . Photograph A Powerpal low-head AC turbine like this one can provide up to 1 kilowatt of power . Water rushes down the manmade aqueduct , then drains into a pipe that 's connected to a turbine near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs are medium to high , you should consider a microhydro system that generates AC power with an alternator right from the start . At that level , you 're nearing the point where electrical space heating can be part of your plans . " A 10-kilowatt system that runs in the winter , " Davis says , " can provide heat that is the equivalent of burning 12 cords of firewood in a sixmonth heating season . " To understand how a microhydro setup operates in real life , it 's often useful to look at examples . At the smaller end of the microhydro spectrum , a remote homestead in British Columbia wanted to produce enough electricity to run lights , radio , radiophone and stereo with an existing 1-inch domestic water supply pipe . The residents had doubts they would still have enough water to run their showers and toilets after the conversion , given the water 's static pressure only amounted to 65 pounds per square inch ( psi ) . They installed a Harris hydroelectric turbine with a Ford alternator close to the house that produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose a 500-watt inverter as the electrical subsystem . This system provides for the homestead 's lights , radio and stereo , but propane provides other vital home services such as refrigeration and cooking . And at the larger end of the microhydro spectrum , a remote First Nations American Indian community in British Columbia needed a high-output system , but the area 's geography challenged the development of a microhydro system . Using an excavator , Davis and his crew dug a usable trench and laid a 4-inchdiameter pipeline , traveling over 900 feet and delivering 350 gpm over 315 feet of vertical head . This hydroelectric system generates a whopping 7,200 kWh per month at a continuous output of 10,000 watts using an 8-inch Pelton turbine wheel , directly driving a brushless 12kilowatt alternator . Microhydro is a clean , sustainable source of power for homesteads in the right location . By considering some of the preceeding requirements , you 'll know if it can be a possibility for you . If it is , Davis ' book and other resources will give you a more thorough look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound foundation for further development .
