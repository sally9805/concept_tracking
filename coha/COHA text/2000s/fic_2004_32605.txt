A House on The Plains Mama said I was thenceforth to be her nephew , and to call her Aunt Dora . She said our fortune depended on her not having a son as old as eighteen who looked more like twenty . Say Aunt Dora , she said . I said it . She was not satisfied . She made me say it several times . She said I must say it believing she had taken me in since the death of her widowed brother , Horace . I said , I did nt know you had a brother named Horace . Of course I do nt , she said with an amused glance at me . But it must be a good story if I could fool his son with it . I was not offended as I watched her primp in the mirror , touching her hair as women do , although you can never see what afterwards is different . With the life insurance , she had bought us a farm fifty miles west of the city line . Who would be there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? But she had her plans and was looking ahead . I had no plans . I had never had plansjust the inkling of something , sometimes , I did nt know what . I hunched over and went down the stairs with the second trunk wrapped to my back with a rope . Outside , at the foot of the stoop , the children were waiting with their scraped knees and socks around their ankles . They sang their own dirty words to a nursery rhyme . I shooed them away and they scattered off for a minute hooting and hollering and then of course came back again as I went up the stairs for the rest of the things . Mama was standing at the empty bay window . While there is your court of inquest on the one hand , she said , on the other is your court of neighbors . Out in the country , she said , there will be no one to jump to conclusions . You can leave the door open , and the window shades up . Everything is clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but Chicago to my mind was the only place to be , with its grand hotels and its restaurants and paved avenues of trees and mansions . Of course not all Chicago was like that . Our third floor windows did nt look out on much besides the row of boardinghouses across the street . And it is true that in the summer people of refinement could be overcome with the smell of the stockyards , although it did nt bother me . Winter was another complaint that wasnt mine . I never minded the cold . The wind in winter blowing off the lake went whipping the ladies skirts like a demon dancing around their ankles . And winter or summer you could always ride the electric streetcars if you had nothing else to do . I above all liked the city because it was filled with people all a-bustle , and the clatter of hooves and carriages , and with delivery wagons and drays and the peddlers and the boom and clank of the freight trains . And when those black clouds came sailing in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the cries or curses of humankind , I liked that best of all . Chicago could stand up under the worst God had to offer . I understood why it was built a place for trade , of course , with railroads and ships and so on , but mostly to give all of us a magnitude of defiance that is not provided by one house on the plains . And the plains is where those storms come from . Besides , I would miss my friend Winifred Czerwinska , who stood now on her landing as I was going downstairs with the suitcases . Come in a minute , she said , I want to give you something . I went in and she closed the door behind me . You can put those down , she said of the suitcases . My heart always beat faster in Winifreds presence . I could feel it and she knew it too and it made her happy . She put her hand on my chest now and she stood on tiptoes to kiss me with her hand under my shirt feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in a coat and tie . Oh , she said , with her eyes tearing up , what am I going to do without my Earle ? But she was smiling . Winifred was not a Mama type of woman . She was a slight , skinny thing , and when she went down the stairs it was like a bird hopping . She wore no powder or perfumery except by accident the confectionary sugar which she brought home on her from the bakery where she worked behind the counter . She had sweet , cool lips but one eyelid did nt come up all the way over the blue , which made her not as pretty as she might otherwise be . And of course she had no titties to speak of . You can write me a letter or two and I will write back , I said . What will you say in your letter ? I will think of something , I said . She pulled me into the kitchen , where she spread her feet and put her forearms flat on a chair so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way she preferred . It did nt take that long , but even so , while Winifred wiggled and made her little cat sounds I could hear Mama calling from upstairs as to where I had gotten . We had ordered a carriage to take us and the luggage at the same time rather than sending it off by the less expensive Railway Express and taking a horsecar to the station . That was not my idea , but exactly the amounts that were left after Mama bought the house only she knew . She came down the steps under her broad-brim hat and widows veil and held her skirts at her shoe tops as the driver helped her into the carriage . We were making a grand exit in full daylight . This was pure Mama as she lifted her veil and glanced with contempt at the neighbors looking out from their windows . As for the nasty children , they had gone quite quiet at our display of elegance . I swung up beside her and closed the door and at her instruction threw a handful of pennies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shove one another and dive to their knees as we drove off . When we had turned the corner , Mama opened the hatbox I had put on the seat . She removed her black hat and replaced it with a blue number trimmed in fake flowers . Over her mourning dress she draped a glittery shawl in striped colors like the rainbow . There , she said . I feel so much better now . Are you all right , Earle ? Yes , Mama , I said . Aunt Dora . Yes , Aunt Dora . I wish you had a better mind , Earle . You could have paid more attention to the Doctor when he was alive . We had our disagreements , but he was smart for a man . The train stop of La Ville was a concrete platform and a lean-to for a waiting room and no ticket-agent window . When you got off , you were looking down an alley to a glimpse of their Main Street . Main Street had a feed store , a post office , a white wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a town square with a four-story hotel , and in the middle of the square on the grass the statue of a Union soldier . It could all be counted because there was just one of everything . A man with a dray was willing to take us . He drove past a few other streets where first there were some homes of substance and another church or two but then , as you moved further out from the town center , worn looking one-story shingle houses with dark little porches and garden plots and clotheslines out back with only alleys separating them . I couldnt see how , but Mama said there was a population of over three thousand living here . And then after a couple of miles through farmland , with a silo here and there off a straight road leading due west through fields of corn , there swung into view what I had not expected , a three-story house of red brick with a flat roof and stone steps up to the front door like something just lifted out of a street of row houses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for a farmhouse . The sun flared in the windowpanes and I had to shade my eyes to make sure I was seeing what I saw . But that was it in truth , our new home . Not that I had the time to reflect , not with Mama settling in . We went to work . The house was cobwebbed and dusty and it was rank with the droppings of animal life . Blackbirds were roosting in the top floor , where I was to live . Much needed to be done , but before long she had it all organized and a parade of wagons was coming from town with the furniture shed Expressed and no shortage of men willing to hire on for a day with hopes for more from this grand good-looking lady with the rings on several fingers . And so the fence went up for the chicken yard , and the weed fields beyond were being plowed under and the watering hole for stock was dredged and a new privy was dug , and I thought for some days Mama was the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haul the well water and wash the clothes and bake the bread ? A farm was a different life , and days went by when I slept under the roof of the third floor and felt the heat of the day still on my pallet as I looked through the little window at the remoteness of the stars and I felt unprotected as I never had in the civilization we had retreated from . Yes , I thought , we had moved backward from the worlds progress , and for the first time I wondered about Mamas judgment . In all our travels from state to state and with all the various obstacles to her ambition , I had never thought to question it . But no more than this house was a farmers house was she a farmer , and neither was I. One evening we stood on the front steps watching the sun go down behind the low hills miles away . Aunt Dora , I said , what are we up to here ? I know , Earle . But some things take time . She saw me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am bringing an immigrant woman down from Wisconsin . She will sleep in that room behind the kitchen . Shes to be here in a week or so . Why ? I said . Theres women in La Ville , the wives of all these locals come out here for a days work who could surely use the money . I will not have some woman in the house who will only take back to town what she sees and hears . Use what sense God gave you , Earle . I am trying , Mama . Aunt Dora , goddamnit . Aunt Dora . Yes , she said . Especially here in the middle of nowhere and with nobody else in sight . She had tied her thick hair behind her neck against the heat and she went about now loose in a smock without her usual womens underpinnings . But does nt the air smell sweet , she said . Im going to have a screen porch built and fit it out with a settee and some rockers so we can watch the grand show of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nt have to pout , she said . You may not appreciate it here this moment with the air so peaceful and the birds singing and nothing much going on in any direction you can see . But were still in business , Earle . You can trust me on that . And so I was assured . By and by we acquired an old-fashioned horse and buggy to take us to La Ville and back when Aunt Dora had to go to the bank or the post office or provisions were needed . I was the driver and horse groom . Hethe horseand I did not get along . I wouldnt give him a name . He was ugly , with a sway back and legs that trotted out splayed . I had butchered and trimmed better looking plugs than this in Chicago . Once , in the barn , when I was putting him up for the night , he took a chomp in the air just off my shoulder . Another problem was Bent , the handyman Mama had hired for the steady work . No sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was strutting around like he owned the place . This was a problem as I saw it . Sure enough , one day he told me to do something . It was one of his own chores . I thought you was the hired one , I said to him . He was ugly , like a relation of the horsehe was shorter than you thought he ought to be with his long arms and big gnarled hands hanging from them . Get on with it , I said . Leering , he grabbed me by the shoulder and put his mouth up to my ear . I seen it all , he said . Oh yes . I seen everything a man could wish to see . At this I found myself constructing a fate for Bent the handyman . But he was so drunkly stupid I knew Mama must have her own plan for him or else why would she play up to someone of this ilk , and so I held my ideas in abeyance . In fact I was by now thinking I could wrest some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plains as far as you could see . What had come to mind ? A sense of expectancy that I recognized from times past . Yes . I had sensed that whatever was going to happen had begun . There was not only the handyman . There were the orphan children . She had contracted for three from the do-good agency in New York that took orphans off the streets and washed and dressed them and put them on the train to their foster homes in the midland . Ours were comely enough children , though pale , two boys and a girl with papers that gave their ages , six , six , and eight , and as I trotted them to the farm they sat up behind me staring at the countryside without a word . And so now they were installed in the back bedroom on the second floor , and they were not like the miserable street rats from our neighborhood in the city . These were quiet children except for the weeping they were sometimes given to at night , and by and large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real feeling for themJoseph and Calvin and the girl , Sophie , in particular . There were no conditions as to what faith they were to be brought up in nor did we have any in mind . But on Sundays , Mama took to showing them off to the Methodist church in La Ville in the new clothes she had bought for them . It gave her pleasure , and was besides a presentation of her own pride of position in life . Because it turned out , as I was learning , that even in the farthest reaches of the countryside , you lived in society . And in this great scheme of things my Aunt Dora required little Joseph , Calvin , and Sophie to think of her as their mama . Say Mama , she said to them . And they said it . Well , so here was this household of us , ready made , as something bought from a department store . Fannie was the imported cook and housekeeper , who by Mamas design spoke no English but understood well enough what had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the strength to work hard . And besides Bent , who skulked about by the barns and fences in the sly pretense of work , there was a real farmer out beyond , who was sharecropping the acreage in corn . And two mornings a week a retired county teacher woman came by to tutor the children in reading and arithmetic . Mama said one evening : We are an honest to goodness enterprise here , a functioning family better off than most in these parts , but we are running at a deficit , and if we do nt have something in hand before winter the only resources will be the insurance I took out on the little ones . She lit the kerosene lamp on the desk in the parlor and wrote out a Personal and read it to me : Widow offering partnership in prime farmland to dependable man . A modest investment is required . &; Continues ...
