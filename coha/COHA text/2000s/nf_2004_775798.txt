This book is a guide to the American empire as it begins openly to spread its imperial wings . Its reach is global : as of September 2001 , the Department of Defense acknowledged at least 725 American military bases existed outside the United States . Actually , there are many more , since some bases exist under leaseholds , informal agreements , or disguises of various kinds . And more have been created since the announcement was made . The landscape of this military empire is as unfamiliar and fantastic to most Americans today as Tibet or Timbuktu were to nineteenth-century Europeans . Among its recent additions are the al-Udeid air base in the desert of Qatar , where several thousand American military men and women live in air-conditioned tents , and the al-Masirah Island naval air station in the Gulf of Oman , where the only diversion is " wadi ball , " a cross between volleyball and football . It includes expensive , permanent garrisons built between 1999 and 2001 in such unlikely places as Kosovo , Kyrgyzstan , and Uzbekistan . America 's modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much like those north Indian hill towns the administrators of the British Raj used for rest and recreation in the summer heat . The modern equivalents of Darjeeling , Kalimpong , and Srinagar are the armed forces ' ski and vacation center at Garmisch in the Bavarian Alps , its resort hotel in downtown Tokyo , and the 234 military golf courses it operates worldwide , not to mention the seventy-one Learjets , thirteen Gulfstream IIIs , and seventeen Cessna Citation luxury jets used to fly admirals and generals to such spots . At a cost of $50 million apiece , each Gulfstream accommodates twelve passengers plus two pilots , one flight engineer , a communications systems operator , and a flight attendant . // Like empires of old , ours has its proconsuls , in this case high-ranking military officers who enforce extraterritorial " status of forces agreements " on host governments to ensure that American troops are not held responsible for crimes they commit against local residents . Our militarized empire is a physical reality with a distinct way of life but it is also a network of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to American corporations , universities , and communities but kept separate from what passes for everyday life back in what has only recently come to be known as " the homeland . " And yet even that sense of separation is disappearing-for the changing nature of the empire is changing our society as well . // For example , slowly but surely the Department of Defense is obscuring and displacing the Department of State as the primary agency for making and administering foreign policy . We now station innumerably more uniformed military officers than civilian diplomats , aid workers , or environmental specialists in foreign countries-a point not lost on the lands to which they are assigned . Our garrisons send a daily message that the United States prefers to deal with other nations through the use or threat of force rather than negotiations , commerce , or cultural interaction and through military-to-military , not civilian-to-civilian , relations . This point was made clear in a speech at the military academy at West Point on June 1 , 2002 , when President George W. Bush argued that the United States must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against as many as sixty countries . " We must take that battle to the enemy , disrupt his plans and confront the worst threats before they emerge . " Americans must be " ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty and to defend our lives .... In the world we have entered , the only path to safety is the path of action . And this nation will act . " // As historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , adviser to President John F. Kennedy , observed on the first anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , " One of the astonishing events of recent months is the presentation of preventive war as a legitimate and moral instrument of U.S. foreign policy .... During the Cold War , advocates of preventive war were dismissed as a crowd of loonies .... The policy of containment plus deterrence won the Cold War . After the collapse of the Soviet Union , everyone thanked heaven that the preventive-war loonies had never got into power in any major country . Today , alas , they appear to be in power in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush administration 's secretary of defense , Dick Cheney-now , of course , vice president-the second Bush administration 's secretary of defense , Donald Rumsfeld , and their cronies in the Pentagon . The last time civilian and uniformed militarists even approximated the domination of American political life we see today was when Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was dictating policy toward Vietnam . // Like most other Americans who are not actively involved with the armed forces , I paid very little attention to our empire of military bases until February 1996 , when I made my first visit to our de facto American military colony of Okinawa , a small Japanese island that we have continuously occupied since 1945 . My last encounter with the military had ended forty years earlier-when , in the summer of 1955 , I left active duty as a naval officer in the western Pacific . In 1996 , in the wake of the rape of a twelve-year-old Okinawan girl by two American marines and a sailor , I was invited by the island 's governor , Masahide Ota , to speak about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed by the marines ' massive Camp Hansen , where the abduction and rape had occurred-and interviewed local officials . I came away deeply disturbed both by Okinawan hostility and by the fact that no serious American strategy could explain the deployment of thirty-eight separate bases on the choicest 20 percent of the island . // It was apparent from the numerous beaches , golf courses , and other recreational facilities reserved for the use of our military and the duplication involved in separate air force , navy , and Marine Corps airfields that the bases had simply sprouted willy-nilly with the advent of the Cold War . No consideration had been given to equitable land use or the lives of the 1.3 million Okinawans . The military 's situation in Okinawa struck me as similar to that of Soviet troops in East Germany after the Berlin Wall came down . In both cases the troops preferred to stay on because the pleasures of life as a legionnaire in an imperial garrison far outstripped those of life back in the " homeland .
