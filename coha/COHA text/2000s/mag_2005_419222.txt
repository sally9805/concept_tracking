Flagging a mere handful of rivers you ought to fish before you get to that big one in the sky is like playing travel agent for an angler who tells you he 's got two weeks off and wants to fish a " great " stream someplace . Maybe for you a great river is one where you measure the fish from your shoulder to your fingertips . Maybe it 's a place where a small brookie is a trophy but you 're the only person there , or a place where bass swarm like piranhas on a stuck pig . Perhaps it 's an exotic river in a strange land as far from home and work as you can get . If money and time were no object , I 'd send you to rivers in western and eastern Russia , to Chile and Argentina , to both islands of New Zealand and to Brazil 's Rio Negro , where your lures or flies would be savaged by thug-faced peacock bass . Realistically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America , so you 're getting my picks  --  supported by input from a few of my world-traveled , hardcore fishing cronies  --  of the 10 rivers you really should fish on this continent . There will be howls of disagreement , of course . But the rivers selected here are those of great historical importance to us as anglers . In addition to breath-catching beauty , many have an amazing variety of species , and , if you hit them right , the fishing can be incredible . SNAKE RIVER // Hells Canyon , Idaho/Oregon This is adrenaline-rush country . Had they chosen to shoot the 1994 thriller The River Wild on this run of the Snake instead of the Rogue , Meryl Streep would likely have quite on the spot . The rapids are maelstroms where jet boats and gutsy rafters slalom between giant boulders and 8-foot standing waves . Once , after surviving one of those rapids to reach the graceful , powerful fishing water , I pried Pat McManus 's whitened fingers from the boat 's gunwale and thrust a rod into his hand . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed it to the uncontrollable twitch that had developed in his arm . As a younger man , G. Loomis 's executive director Bruce Holt cut his teeth on bronzebacks here . " Let a spinner tipped with pork flutter into the shadows of those big boulders and a bass would smack , " he says . " We caught so many we just did n't tell anyone because nobody would believe it . " The rainbows in the river are especially good in summer , and steelhead are prime fall through winter . White sturgeon here reach 10 feet and can wreck you . You 'll find catfish , too . The canyon is the deepest in North America . Only three roads access this river sector . Consider a combo fishing/chukar hunt trip in fall . Lodging and RV sites are available . This is a busy , high-energy venue . Contact : Hells Canyon Adventures , 800-422-3568 ; Kilgore Adventures , 800-469-8757 . YELLOWSTONE RIVER // Montana Years back , the late , great guide Ray Hurley drove around on fishing trips in a converted ambulance . Trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankee Jim Canyon with him , I wondered if it was still first-aid-equipped . We were catching rainbows , browns and cutthroats , and although I knew that the truly big fish would be squatting behind the boulders , we were focused on just getting through . The stretch of Yellowstone from Gardiner to the Canyon and then down to Tom Miner Creek is powerful water best fished from a boat , though during lower levels it 's possible to wade a bit . The Yellowstone is arguably the most varied trout river in North America , and at 670 miles long it 's the only undammed major river in the Lower 48 . The headwaters and its small tributaries hold lovely cutthroat trout that you 'll have to work to reach . The town of Livingston is the river 's nerve center , and talk of fishing fills the air in every eatery and saloon . In fact , you 'll find fine fishing just east of town in braided channels and riffles . Except for Yankee Jim Canyon , the nearly 60-mile stretch from Gardiner down to the magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's also the most popular stretch . Find solitude by targeting the broad , huge-riffled section from Sheep Mountain to below Big Timber . From mid-April into early May , this stretch explodes with caddis hatches so prolific you 'll literally inhale the things . The best area for the giant salmonfly hatch in early July is between Gardiner and Emigrant . Contact : Dan Bailey 's Fly Shop , 800-356-4052 . CLARKS FORK // Montana Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone offers marvelous angling in its small headwater tributaries for those willing to explore beyond the established trails . Macauley Lord , L.L. Bean 's chief casting instructor , calls the tributaries " pure gold , where a ten-inch brookie is a trophy " and suggests hunting for the " inlets and outlets of tiny glacial ponds , which can run thick with trout . " A nameless , woods-protected outflow harbors large rainbows in fairly wide water . " One tiny outlet from a large lake should be seen from the east near sunset , " says Lord . " In the roar of the stream 's thousand-foot plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sun and you 'll see only the fins of large cutthroat and brook trout glowing in silhouette . " Contact : Dan Bailey 's Fly Shop , 800-356-4052 . HENRYS FORK // Idaho From the Osborne bridge to Pinehaven , including Harriman State Park , Henrys Fork is a gigantic spring " creek " with soft water , fecund insect hatches and hefty rainbow trout . During the June green drake hatch it can be crowded , though mostly by the courteous . The trout find life easy and are as fickle as debutantes . Newcomers sometimes confuse rising native whitefish with the cavalier trout . I delight in the story Mike Lawson , the undisputed dean of Henrys Fork , once told about his early days here . " One time I worked on this big bank feeder maybe twenty minutes , " he said . As he reeled in his catch , he made an unpleasant discovery . " Whitefish ! By golly ! " Mike 's basso profundo voice grew to operatic volume . " I like ta squeeze his dang face clean off ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Box Canyon , but Henrys Fork has many other areas where you 'll find more elbowroom . From Riverside Campground ( a good spot to stay ) to Warm River , the river receives little pressure . You can hike in via Forest Service roads but you 'll need to negotiate a steep canyon down and back . The canyon opens below the Warm , with road access to good brown trout that fall for streamers later in season or stonefly imitations early in June . The Warm River is a good back-country tributary , ideal for fishing with your family , as is the Buffalo . The Fork 's other major tribs  --  the Fall and Teton rivers  --  are blue-ribbon trout waters , too . The tailwater section below Ashton dam past St. Anthony to the Snake has excellent fishing . Mid-June through early July , Gray Drake spinners bring up big trout here while most anglers are casting Green Drakes at the Ranch . By the Memorial Day opener , stonefly hatches have normally begun . Below St. Anthony is beautiful braid water , but access is permission-only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800-788-4479 . KENAI RIVER // Alaska The Kenai River pierces its namesake peninsula like an aquamarine sliver of glass en route to the huge Cook Inlet . The river gushes from Kenai Lake , passes through Skilak Lake and runs largely along the Sterling Highway . Such road access is rare for the 49th state and gives anglers a taste of Alaska fishing without fly-ins . But the easy access results in shoulder-to-shoulder salmon angling that 's often described as combat fishing . I prefer floating the Kenai 's smaller upper water for huge Dolly Vardens and spectacular rainbow trout that can break the 30-inch mark . From May through July thousands of giant king salmon enter the river , and from below Skilak Lake on downstream into big , deep water , hundreds of anglers hunt them . They drift roe and Spin-N-Glows and troll big plugs . Fish weighting 25 to 45 pounds are common . A 97-pound beast is the record , and dreams of a 100-pounder keep many anglers coming back for another try . The 18 river miles from Kenai Lake to Skilak Lake , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is where OL Photo Editor Cherie Cincilla was hopelessly spoiled cutting her flyfishing teeth on armlength Dollies , a place where you expect solitude , floating in motorless rafts or drifts boats . This stretch also has decent road access . When the season opens in June , smolt-pattern flies , sculpins , buggers and green Muddlers are all good . By August the Dollies and rainbows are chomping sock-eye eggs and becoming more and more color-selective . Leeches , buggers and sculpins can also bring satisfying results in September , and downstream of snags , try casting some ginger/blonde flesh flies .

Each section is different and each is best fished at different times . The upper river fishes well in spring . Late September through October pig trout swim from Hebgen Lake and eat big streamers . The lower river below Ennis Lake is a shallow , weedy tailwater best fished fall throuh winter into June . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  known as the 50-Mile Riffle  --  that owns the hearts of most anglers . " Floating from Varney Bridge to Ennis is a visual spectacle that makes my neck hair stand up , " says Scientific Anglers line wizard Bruce Richards . Since the Madison 's wonderful recovery from the whirling disease blight in the ' 90s , the river can get crowded . Heed a tip from Fly Fisherman editor and publisher John Randolph : " Pennsylvania angling master George Harvey learned how to nail quality water in the midst of fishing pressure , " he says . " Ease into the water and fish only the first three feet from the bank and you 'll have your own channel , unless some wader has chased the fish briefly to deeper water .

BIGHORN RIVER // Montana Hunting Editor Jim Zumbo and I were just pulling up stakes when former NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw and his buddy Ted Turner came to the riverbank . Their favorite waters had all blown out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bighorn from Afterbay Dam were still clear . The Bighorn 's year-round consistency is legendary . You can fish it any season . April to May sees more pressure because of intense midge hatches . There 's hopper action late summer into September . Subsurface scuds , sow bugs and worm imitations take fish all the time . Streamers are great , too , as are mini crankbaits . " The Bighorn 's population of rainbows and browns has declined with Western drought and reduced flows , " says Fly Fisherman 's John Randolph , " but the good news is that average trout size is up and angler numbers have decreased . The river has lost none of its glitter for me . " In autumn the Bighorn is swarming with waterfowl . Rooster pheasants cackle raucously at dawn , and big brown trout will attack almost anything .

Everything that lives in Lake Michigan is likely to swim its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pike and even sturgeon are there for the catching . The big draws are salmon and lake-run steelhead that run as far upstream as Tippy Dam near Wellston . If you intend to chase these species and want to avoid the worst of the fishing pressure , do n't fish the peak weekends in April or from mid-September to mid-November , although weekdays during these periods are n't bad . Try fishing a mile or so from Tippy Dam for less competition . Trout are another story . I 've relished wonderful trout fishing solitude within the Manistee National Forest with outfitter Ray Schmidt from below Hodenpyl Dam down to Tippy . Browns are found throughout the river and you can target holdover rainbows in the upper waters and brookies in the tributaries . You can backpack in , camp and fish here . Above Hodenpyl , the upper-river reaches south of Mancelona hold beautiful brook trout beneath brushy cover . " Really big trout are in tailwater sections , " says Scientific Anglers ' Bruce Richards . " A boat is good to have in the broader water from Tippy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually as a tandem rig incorporating a stonefly nymph . Anything can happen in the lower river , though . Once we were fishing steelies in November and my Lab , Fred , retrieved a lake trout . Fred 's mouth was soft so the laker swam away just fine . " Contact : Schmidt Outfitters , 888-221-9056 . COLORADO RIVER // Arizona My friend Matt Vincent might be the editor of Bass Times , but he 's also a closet trout fanatic who waxes poetic ( he 'll kill me for that ) when describing his favorite river  --  the 14-mile stretch of the Colorado below Glen Canyon Dam . " It 's not so much a place as a spiritual awakening , " Matt says with reverence . " Petroglyphs of the Anasazi on six-hundred-foot-tall crimson sandstone walls ; the raw , exposed geological history of the planet ; the memories of ten-pound trout . " The consistent water temperature from below the dam keeps this tailwater fishing going strong year-round , though the air temperature can soar to 110 degrees in summer and drop to zero in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular times to fish . Casting for rainbow " piglets " is mainly from private or guide boats , with a couple of good hike-ins down side canyons below the ferry launch . Water releases introduce scuds and worms into the river and are the reason tandem nymph/scud rigs are productive . Spin-fishers use jigs and sometimes back-troll lures . Barbless hooks are required for all . Stalk shallow fish from mid-November into March . Then in mid-March , midge hatches catch fire as trout move into runs and riffles . Glen Canyon Dam may have been a symbol of evil to Ed Abbey 's Monkey Wrench Gang , but it has built a helluva fishery for nonindigenous critters : trout .

KENNEBEC RIVER // Maine Between Augusta and Moosehead Lake , nine dams fashion the middle-upper Kennebec River into a crazy quilt of tailwaters , gentle canoe water , a whitewater gorge run and fine wadable sections . Rainbow , brook and brown trout , landlocked salmon and smallmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaching of Edwards Dam in Augusta , stripers , shad , sturgeon , Atlantic salmon and several forage herring species ascend the 17 newly opened miles . There are browns here , too . The lower Kennebec from Bath down to the ocean has captured my heart with its great runs of striped bass from May through September and the pushes of voracious bluefish in July . Broad and deep , with powerful currents , the lower river can be sly and quiet or explode into a whitecapped maelstrom of fighting wind and tide . It can wrap you in impenetrable fog one moment and spit you out into bright skies and shoulder-baking sun the next . You can fish any of a number of ways here , from natural baits or light-tackle Slug-Gos to surface poppers or deeply sunken streamer flies . A potpourri of guides fish the river in everything from flats skiffs to small cabin craft . This is Maine 's undisputed queen of striper rivers .
