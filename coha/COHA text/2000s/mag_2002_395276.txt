THE ROOTS OF INTELLIGENCE ARE BIOLOGICAL . Every animal , even a protozoan , must have a mechanism to perceive stimuli , such as noxious chemicals , and to judge whether they are good or bad for it . At that level intelligence is like breathing : essential to survival , but not to dominance . To this primitive capacity for get Headnote ting information from physical objects , humans have joined the ability to get it from words . This verbal ability has led to a form of intelligence far more powerful than the kind used by animals or men to hunt prey or flee predators . It has driven the rise of intelligence to its present significance .

But these episodes were sporadic . Most did not stem from an organized effort to gain intelligence . Though rulers outlined campaigns , they did not detail mobilization and battle plans , giving intelligence little to discover . That is why , in 14 of Edward Creasy 's Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World : from Marathon to Waterloo , victory was decided by strength , brains , and will-with knowledge of the enemy playing an insignificant role . The exception was the Battle of the Metaurus River in Italy in 207 B.C. The Romans , having intercepted a Carthaginian message , were able to concentrate their forces , defeat Hasdrubal before his brother Hannibal could reinforce him and become the chief power of the Western world . The French and industrial revolutions begat new conditions . In creating the modern world , they created modern intelligence . The desire of Frenchmen to defend their new democratic nation against the invading armies of monarchist states , and the need to counter the professionalism of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to armies far larger than those of the past . This levee en masse called for a war economy to support it . Crops were requisitioned . Industrial output was nationalized . Suddenly , factors that had never counted in war became significant . It mattered little to a medieval king how much coal and iron his enemy could produce ; such knowledge was vital to a modern head of state . Railroads made possible the rapid mobiliza- tion , concentration and supply of large bodies of troops . These deployments called for war plans far more detailed than any ever envisioned by Caesar or Frederick . At last , intelligence had targets that gave it a chance to play a major role in war . The industrial and political revolutions also expanded the sources that enabled intelligence to gain access to these new targets . I divide these sources into two kinds . The first consists of information drawn not from words but from things . It is seeing marching troops , fortifications , supply dumps , campfire smoke ; hearing tank-motor noise ; smelling cooking ; feeling ground vibrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came only from the observations of the common soldier , patrols , the cavalry . But the balloon , the zeppelin , the airplane provided more physical intelligence more quickly than the deepest-driving horsemen . The camera saw more than the eye and reproduced its vision for others . Radar detected oncoming bombers long before the eye could spot them . In addition , larger armies meant more prisoners who might report on , say , the supply situation or artillery positions . All these sources provided more physical intelligence than armies had ever before been able to get . But this increase was greatly outstripped by the growth of the second source , verbal intelligence . This acquires information from a written or oral source , such as a stolen plan , a report on troop morale , an overheard order , even a computerized strength report . It is important to understand that it is the source that matters , not the method of acquisition or the method of transmission . The presence of tanks can be ascertained by a spy and reported by telephone , but this information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a spy and relayed by a photograph , but the information is verbal intelligence . The difference rests solely on the objects of intelligence themselves . Verbal objects mean verbal intelligence ; nonverbal , physical intelligence . Verbal intelligence made intelligence as important as it is today . Photograph Left : American detection via this October 23 , 1962 , aerial intelligence photograph of a Soviet ballistic missile launch site in San Cristobal , Cuba , set into motion the Cuban missile crisis . Opposite : Intelligence gathered by radar is charted aboard an aircraft carrier in the Pacific during strikes against Japan in August 1945. // Verbal intelligence had long been relatively sparse . But the two revolutions engendered new sources . Larger armies yielded more documents for seizure . Parliamentary government , with its debates and public reports , exposed many specifics about a nation 's military strength and programs . A daily press reported on these as well as on the economic situation . The tapping of telegraph wires and the interception of radio messages furnished far more verbal intelligence than the occasional waylaying of a courier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more valuable information than can physical intelligence . Understanding this must begin with an acknowledgment that war has both a material and a psychological component . The material elements consist of such tangibles as troops , guns and supplies . The psychological comprises such matters as a commander 's will , his tactical ability and the morale of his troops . The material factors dominate : the most brilliant , most determined commander of a regiment can not withstand an army . And this factor is served by verbal intelligence , while the less important psychological component is served by physical intelligence . The reason is this : The men and weapons that are the sources of physical intelligence affirm the likelihood of an encounter with greater probability than a plan , because men can not move guns or troops as easily as they can rewrite orders . Greater probability is another way of saying less anxiety , and anxiety is a psychological factor . Physical intelligence , by lessening anxiety , steadies command . On the other hand , verbal intelligence deals with intentions , and just as the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows about them gains time to prepare against them . He can shift his forces from an unthreatened flank to an endangered one , for example . In other words , verbal intelligence magnifies strength-or , in the current jargon , is a force multiplier . Thus it serves the material component of war , and because that component is the more decisive , verbal intelligence influences more outcomes than physical . For the first 4,000 years of warfare , up to the start of World War I , nearly all information came from physical intelligence . That is why intelligence played a relatively minor role . Physical intelligence does not often help commanders to win battles . Then , when the guns of August began firing , radio , which in effect turns over a copy of each of its messages to the foe , and the trench telephone , which lets indiscreet chatter be easily overheard , generated enormous quantities of verbal intelligence . These two new sources helped important commanders win important victories . In August 1914 , Germany 's interception of a radioed plainlanguage Russian order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia into ruin and revolution . In 1917 , Britain 's cryptanalysis and revelation of the Zimmermann telegram-in which Germany 's foreign minister , Arthur Zimmermann , promised Mexico her " lost territory " in Texas , New Mexico and Arizona if she would join Germany in a war against America-helped bring the United States into the war , with all that that has entailed . It was the most important intelligence success in history . At last the admirals and generals understood . They and their governments drew the appropriate conclusions . Britain , Germany , Italy , and the United States , none of which had had code-breaking agencies before the war , established them after it . Intelligence had arrived as a significant instrument of war . And in the next world war , verbal sources made intelligence even more useful to commanders . It sped victory , saving treasure and lives . The reading of U-boat messages shortened the Battle of the Atlantic , the most fundamental struggle of the war , by months . Cracking the Japanese " purple " machine enabled the Allies to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany , giving them what U.S. Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall called " our main basis of information regarding Hitler 's intentions in Europe . " The Battle of Midway , which turned the tide of the war in the Pacific , was made possible by intelligence from code-breaking . Generals actually praised intelligence . Marshall said the solutions " contribute greatly to the victory and tremendously to the saving in American lives . " General Dwight Eisenhower wrote to the head of the British secret service , whose best information came from code-breaking , that " the intelligence which has emanated from you .. has been of priceless value to me . " Their tributes crowned the ascent of intelligence from its humble biological origins as a mere instrument of survival to its supreme capability : helping a nation win a war . THE THEORY OF verbal and physical intelligence explains , I believe , how intelligence grew-its past . But it also describes the present , by showing how physical intelligence stea les command anti verbal intelligence magnes strength . So I believe it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should offer . Indeed , it forms the first of three . This first principle defines the function of intelligence . Magnifying strength and steadying command may be compressed into this : Intelligence optimizes one 's resources . I call it O'Brien 's Principle , after Patrick O'Brien , an economic historian , who remarked , " Is n't all intelligence just optimizing one 's resources ? " This is the fundamental , the ultimate purpose of intelligence . O'Brien 's Principle , like any logical proposition , may be obverted . A unit may not have intelligence and thus may not optimize its resources . It may , in intelligence terms , be surprised . Surprise is the obverse of O'Brien 's Principle . // An illumination depicts the battle of the Metaurus River in 207 B.C. , one of the earliest great battles in which the use of intelligence played a crucial role in victory . // Another corollary of O'Brien 's Principle explains what a commander does when he has no intelligence , or faulty intelligence : I have dubbed this the null hypothesis . In the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reserve , Clausewitz said , is " to counter unforeseen threats .... Forces should be held in reserve according to the degree of strategic uncertainty . " In the mental realm , the commander must remain firm in his decisions . He " must trust his judgment and stand like a rock on which the waves break in vain .... The role of determination is to limit the agonies of doubt . " In other words , when a commander lacks the information that can optimize his resources , he replaces it with force and will . These are the counterparts of intelligence in the physical and psychological components of war . The second permanent principle of intelligence holds that it is an auxiliary , not a primary , element in war . Some writers say loosely that intelligence has won this battle or that , but this is hyperbole . Battles and wars are won by men and guns , brains and will . Intelligence merely serves these . It is secondary to disposing one 's forces , obtaining supplies , inspiring the troops . It is indeed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always make up for insufficient strength or inadequate leadership . It is a service , not an arm . The third principle maintains that intelligence is essential to the defense but not the offense . Intelligence exists , of course , in both , but in different ways . The difference is that between an accompanying and a defining characteristic . All elephants are gray , but grayness is not a defining characteristic of elephants , merely an accompanying one . Intelligence is a defining characteristic of the defensive ; it is only an accompanying characteristic of the offense . " What is the concept of defense ? " asked Clausewitz . " The parrying of a blow . What is its characteristic feature ? Awaiting the blow . " Now , an army can await a blow only if it expects one , and it can expect one only on the basis of information or belief , right or wrong , about the enemy . There can be , in other words , no defense without intelligence . And Clausewitz says the same thing contrapositively when he asserts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illumination depicts the battle of the Metaurus River in 207 B.C. , one of the earliest great battles in which the use of intelligence played a crucial role in victory . // To defend is to acknowledge that the initiative comes from the enemy . And , indeed , the offense acts , the defense reacts . The offense prescribes to the enemy ; it makes the basic decisions . It is " complete in itself , " said Clausewitz . Thus , information about enemy intentions , while helpful and to a certain degree always present ( an army must see its enemy to fight it ) , is not essential to an offensive victory . An invading force can march about the countryside , imposing its will , without needing to know where the enemy is . ( If it learns that the enemy plans to counterattack , it shifts to a defensive mode-and then it requires intelligence . ) Military theorist Barry Posen has observed , in the terms of information theory , that the offensive , by seizing the initiative and thereby structuring the battle , reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less uncertainty means less need for intelligence-which , in one of its functions , steadies command . What all of this says is this : While intelligence is necessary to the defense , it is only contingent to the offense . The validity of this principle is demonstrated , I believe , by two data . One is the relative frequency in history of defensive intelligence successes over offensive ones . The second is that the nations that are aggressive tend to neglect intelligence , while nations in a defense posture emphasize and rely on it . A clear example is Poland between World Wars I and It . Her fear of being gobbled up by one or the other of her powerful neighbors motivated heralone of all the powers-to crack the German Enigma cipher machine . An example that proves the irrelevance of intelligence to the offensive is Nazi Germany . Hitler expected to dictate ( and for a while did dictate ) to others as he began to conquer the world ; for this he did not need intelligence , so he neglected his espionage and cryptanalytic organs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war came , his inadequate intelligence failed him . During the Cold War , the United States , worried about Soviet aggression , enormously extended its intelligence agencies . And the Soviet Union , almost paranoid about encirclement and subversion , developed the largest intelligence system on earth . These three principles of intelligence-it optimizes resources , it is an auxiliary function in war and it is essential to the defense but not to the offense-seek to explain intelligence 's operation and its place in the universe , just as the theory of the rise of verbal intelligence seeks to explain how intelligence became as important as it is . But what must intelligence do to improve ? What problems must it resolve ? Photograph A German zeppelin , pictured in 1915 as it ascends from its base for a raid on London . World War I saw the first use of aircraft as both offensive weapons and for intelligence gathering . // I ask this in the largest sense . It is not a question of whether the end of the Cold War decreased intelligence activity or whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economic institutions and terrorists will increase it . Nor is it a question of techniques and their constant seesaw struggle with countermeasures . Intelligence faces two all-encompassing , never-ending problems . Both are ultimately unsolvable . But intelligence must strive for a solution . The first problem is how to foretell what is going to happen . The goal , of course , is to predict everything . And certainly prediction is better in many cases than it ever was before . The new ability springs from the growth in intelligence tools . Wellington said , " All the business of war .. is ... guessing what was at the other side of the hill . " Today , the near blanketing of the theater of war with Buck Rogers-like collection devices-over-the-horizon radar , television cameras in the noses of drones and smart bombs , wide-ranging and detailed surveillance by satellite-renders the other side of the hill almost as visible as this side . It 's hard to imagine an invasion like that of D-Day surprising any nation possessing today 's observation tools . Still , not everything can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commanders change their plans . Accidents happen . These hindrances are multiplied a thousandfold in dealing not with a confined though complex activity like a single battle , but with the major events of the post-World War II world , such as the fall of the Shah of Iran . Many more factors , many more people come into play than in a limited action . Even without secrecy , the interaction of these elements is all but incalculable . As Clausewitz said of the difficulty of evaluating another state 's capabilities and intentions , " Bonaparte was quite right when he said that Newton himself would quail before the algebraic problems it would pose . " This is why intelligence did not foretell North Korea 's gamble in attacking South Korea , the Soviet emplacement of nuclear missiles in Cuba , the end of the Cold War itself . Prediction may be getting better , but it can never be perfect . Even if it were , it would confront intelligence 's other basic problem , which may be called the Cassandra complex : how to get statesmen and generals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can they be awakened to intelligence as the trumpet of a prophecy ? This problem is as old as mankind . Pharaoh slew the bearers of ill tidings . Stalin ignored dozens of warnings that Germany was about to attack his country . The problem was clearly seen by Germany 's pre-World War I chief of the General Staff , Count Alfred von Schlieffen : " The higher commander generally makes himself a picture of friend and foe , in the painting of which personal wishes provide the main elements . If incoming reports appear to correspond with this picture , they are accepted with satisfaction . If they contradict it , they are discarded as entirely false . " Photograph A German zeppelin , pictured in 1915 as it ascends from its base for a raid on London . World War I saw the first use of aircraft as both offensive weapons and for intelligence gathering . // This condition , which psychologists call denial , is not limited to military or political affairs . People often reject reality . Shakespeare long ago set out the phenomenon in Troilus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart , / An esperance so obstinately strong , / That doth invert th ' attest of eyes and ears . " Edna St. Vincent Millay asked her readers to " Pity me that the heart is slow to learn / What the swift mind beholds at every turn . " And a little boy begged of Shoeless Joe Jackson , upon hearing that he had betrayed a World Series for money , " Say it ai n't so , Joe . " CAN THIS VERY HUMAN DISPOSITION be changed ? Can the facts and logic of intelligence ever overcome wishful thinking ? At present , they can only do so if the feelings are not deep-seated . If the consequence of facing the facts is too painful , the evidence will be ignored , suppressed , denied . Where then is intelligence headed ? People see the advantage of permitting intelligence-in both its politico-military and its personal meanings-to rule emotion . They know that reason usually produces better solutions to problems than feelings do . This explains the growth of psychotherapy ; this is part of what Paul meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not do anything against the truth , but only for the truth " ; this is why intelligence is so useful . As David Hume wrote in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding : " We may observe , in every art or profession , even those which most concern life or action , that a spirit of accuracy , however acquired , carries all of them nearer to that perfection . " The very establishment of intelligence agencies indicates a tendency toward greater reliance on facts and logic . The trend 's success suggests that it will continue . Accentuating this trend is an aspect of man 's nature . Aristotle opened his Metaphysics by stating , " All men by nature desire to know . " The first man is the first example . Adam wanted to know what God told him he should not know , so he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , and thus brought death , sin and sorrow into the world . Like Adam , like Faust , every intelligence service strives to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest , nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light . " None achieves it . " It will always be a certain tragedy of every intelligence service , " wrote the first head of Germany 's post-World War I spy service , " that even the best results will always lag behind the clients ' desires . " But the absence of perfection does not keep leaders , political and military , from letting intelligence serve them , any more than they let the absence of perfection keep then from using any other resource they have . Evidently they believe intelligence 's results are worth its costs . Should they always follow its sometimes implied advice ? No . It may be wrong . It is almost certainly incomplete . But they should at least take it into account . The universal tendency toward least effort will further enlarge intelligence . As an optimizer of resources , intelligence saves money by reducing the need to buy military equipment-though , as merely an auxiliary element of war , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is integral to the defense , intelligence will be increasingly seen as essential to nonaggressive nations . Yet it must improve its predictions and must convince leaders to accept them if it is to fully realize its potential . That potential spreads beyond the military . Like the benefactions of knowledge , of which it is a form , the benefactions of intelligence touch all humankind . In war , intelligence optimizes resources and so shortens the struggle , sparing gold and blood . In peace , it reduces uncertainty and so relaxes tensions among states , helping to stabilize the international system . These are the ultimate human goods of intelligence ; these are the ways this servant of war brings peace to man .
