Chapter One An Island in the Rhine River , May 1770 Like everyone , I am born naked . I do not refer to my actual birth , mercifully hidden in the silk folds of memory , but to my birth as a citizen of France citoyenne , they would say . Having shed all my clothing , I stand in a room on an island in the middle of the Rhine River naked . My bare feet occupy for this moment a spot considered to be neutral between beloved Austria and France . The sky blue silk of my discarded skirt wreathes my ankles , and I fancy I am standing bare footed in a puddle of pretty water . My chest is as flat as a shield , marked only by two pink rosebuds of nipples . I refuse to be afraid . In the months since I became fourteen , I 've watched these pleasant rosebuds becomeing a bit plump and pinker . Now the fingers and hands of my attendants are stretching toward my neck to remove a smooth circlet of Austrian pearls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never seen , extending large hands toward me , beckoning . What is he doing this very moment , deep in the heart of France ? At fifteen , a year older than myself , he must be tall and strong . There must be other words than tall and strong to think of to describe him , to help me imagine and embody hisreality . My mother , Empress of Austria , has told me how to anticipate the meeting of our bodies and all the events of my life to come ; I am always in her prayers . Every month I will write to her and she to me , and our private letters will travel by our own couriers between France and Austria . When I try to picture my future husband , Louis Auguste , standing in the forests of France with hands and arms out stretched to me , I can only envision my most dear mother , dressed in black , sitting behind me like a dark wedge at her desk ; she awaits the courier bearing a white rectangular packet , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Versailles , when Louis Auguste and I are alone in bed , certain events will follow . We will copulate through the door at the bottom of my body ; next , I become pregnant . Nine months after my marriage I give birth to a baby . There will be many witnesses when my body , then age fifteen , opens to produce a future king . Years from then , after my husband has died , this baby will be the seventeenth Louis , King of France . This is what I know . While my ladies flutter like bright butterflies around me , I glance at my naked body , a slender worm . Louis Auguste and I must be much the same , as all humans are really much the same , except for the difference of sex . We all have two legs mine are slender supporting a torso ; two arms sprout on either side of a bodily cabinet , which contains the guts and bladder in the lower compartment and the heaving lungs and heart in the up per section . In between , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the trunk , a neck rises up like a small lookout tower whose finial is the head . Mine is a graceful body made strong by dancing and riding and of a milky porcelain color . Recently a few curly threads emerged from the triangle between my legs . Squeezing my thighs together , I try to shelter this delicate garden because my new hair seems frail and flimsy . The French word for him , the prince who will become my husband and king , is Dauphin , and the French word for me , who will be his bride , is the same , but with a small letter e , curled like a snail in its flinty house , at the end of the word : Dauphine . I have many French words to learn . My darling Austrian ladies sail around me in their bright silk dresses cerise , and emerald , deep blue with yellow stripes ; their throats and sleeves bedecked with frothy , drooping lace . Like dancers , they bend and swoop to gather the garments I 've shed ; other ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across their forearms , cloth of gold and filmy lavender . A flock of goose bumps sweeps over my bare flesh . Antonia , the pretty mouths of my ladies breathe , Antonia . Their eyes glisten with unshed tears , for I am about to abandon my old name . The stern French require that I step forward , naked , with no ribbon , memento , ruby , or brooch of Austrian de sign . To my ladies , I display my open palms so they may witness and affirm that I leave empty handed and am beholden in no way to my native Austria . Resplendent in rich colors , they draw near , in a solemn circle , to regard my vacant hands . My nakedness complete , now I die as Maria Antonia , Archduchess of Austria , daughter of Maria Theresa , Empress of Austria . To be her worthy daughter , I will that my chilled flesh unpucker itself and become all smooth and lovely . Clothed nobly in nothing but my own skin , described as pearly by some in its translucent sheen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer Maria Antonia but my French self , now named : Marie Antoinette . I gasp my first damp breath of French air on this small island embraced by the arms of the rushing Rhine and re member the admonition of my mother : Do so much good to the French people that they can say that I have sent them an angel . So said my mother , Empress of Austria , and I will love them , and they will love me , and I will love my husband , who is shy , they say , and the old King , Louis XV , who is not my future husband 's father ( that Dauphin having died without his ever having become king ) but his grandfather ; and I will love the maiden aunts of my future husband , Louis Auguste , who will become Louis XVI , God willing ( but not soon , not soon I hope and pray , for in fact I know that not only my unformed body but also my spirit is still that of a child ) , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France , who has made my happiness come about by mating me with Louis Auguste , whom I have never seen yet and I will love the Count Mercy d'Argenteau , for he is Austrian Austrian ! and my mother 's friend and our no , not " our " but " the " Austrian ambassador to France . I will love them all , especially Choiseul the foreign minister and Mercy the Austrian ambassador , even as I have been instructed always to love those who further our cause the peace of Europe . And I will find new friends , my very own friends , to love as though they were sisters . ( Continues ... )
