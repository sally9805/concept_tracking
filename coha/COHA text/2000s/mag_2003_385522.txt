After her rowdy dive bar became the subject of a Hollywood movie , Lil Lovell decided to make herself some money  --  which she did . But she also got a sobering look at the world of licensing <p> Liliana Lovell 's Cabo San Lucas bar started out badly . Then it got worse . Back in 1993 , Lovell , known as Lil , had founded the Coyote Ugly Saloon , a rowdy , honky-tonk dive in New York City 's East Village . Seven years later her life as a barkeep changed drastically when Coyote Ugly , a movie set in a Hollywood version of her bar , was released . Seizing on the free publicity , Lovell ginned up plans to turn Coyote Ugly into an international chain . She was n't the only one with the idea , however . Shortly after the movie 's release , Jorge Manterola , the brother of the well-known Mexican singer Patricia Manterola , set up a website claiming to be the " master franchise " for Coyote Ugly in Latin America . " Just like you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there will be very preety sic and sensual women from all over the world serving drinks , dancing on the bar , and doing the most funniest and unimaginable things . " <p> Lovell was not amused . The hard-drinking cowgirl brand that she 'd spent years building was being hijacked . " People are taking my hard work , and it 's frustrating , " says Lovell , a petite woman who delivers tough talk in a smoky voice . " I put my time in and I paid my dues , and for people to steal things is weak of character . " Her lawyers swung into action and by August 2001 she 'd made a deal : She 'd help Manterola open a huge Coyote Ugly in Cabo as long as he paid license royalties to her . <p> But Lovell 's Baja problems did n't end . She could revoke the license if she was n't paid , but she had little control over how the bar was run . It was bad enough for Lovell that Manterola was n't paying all of the rent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was worse was what she heard from his employees . Manterola hired women from America to bartend with promises of housing and cabs to work , but they were e-mailing Lovell , who they 'd met in Cabo , with claims that Manterola was neither paying them nor living up to his other promises ( Manterola denies their claims ) . And Lovell could do nothing about it . <p> LOVELL 'S CABO EXPERIENCE ILLUSTRATES a dilemma faced by any small-business woman who wants to turn her first venture into something big . How do you expand and make money while still controlling your brand ? In a short-term view , the answer seems simple : License willy-nilly , drive hard , and just go  --  which is exactly what Lovell did . This past September the ninth Coyote Ugly opened in Boston for Ugly Inc. , Lovell 's licensing company , which brought in $1.5 million in 2002 and is expected to make almost triple that this year . Together , the bars pull in between $22 million and $24 million annually and employ about 300 people . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stray from the brand she defined , Lovell came to another conclusion : no more . Except for the 14 licenses she 's already sold , she will protect her brand by keeping a controlling stake in all new Coyote Ugly Saloons . " If I license to too many people , it 's going to lose its foundation . So I 'm just going to stop , " Lovell says . " I 'm not willing to just sit back and let someone else control my company . " <p> TO UNDERSTAND COYOTE UGLY , YOU HAVE TO UNDERstand a basic equation : Lil Lovell=Coyote Ugly . It was late 1992 and Lovell , then 24 , had spent nearly three years managing the Village Idiot , a notorious New York City gin mill where owner Tom McNeil raced customers through pints of Guinness , chewed Pabst cans , and peed behind the jukebox . There , Lovell developed the style that became Coyote . " I 'd get a few drinks in me and I 'd jump on the bar and get the girls on it too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idiot starting receiving overdue tax notes , Lovell and one of her regulars , Tony Piccirillo , each gave Lovell 's then-boyfriend $10,000 to buy up the stock of a foundering baseball card shop that would then be sold for a profit . Instead , the boyfriend leased a shuttered restaurant for $4,200 a month . Lovell and Piccirillo ( now her husband ) soon kicked him out and on January 27 , 1993 , Coyote Ugly was born . <p> Lovell 's genius was to wrap the barfly fantasy in a tough-girl blanket . Her theory : Men would stay late and spend lavishly if the bartenders were smart enough to sass them and sexy enough to dance on the bar . " The whole concept is girls keeping patrons in the bar drinking " says Jacqui Squatriglia , the chain 's choreographer and New York bar manager . " It 's not about the prettiest girl . It 's somebody with spark . " It was n't an entirely unique proposition  --  similar bars , like Hogs &; Heifers Saloon in New York City 's meatpacking district , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built a Thelma &; Louise version of their lives . " Lil was pouring liquor down her body and off her toe . I was saying , ' I 'll arm-wrestle you for a beer , ' " Squatriglia recalls . <p> Drinkers flocked to the bourbon-and-beer joint  --  decorated with Harley-Davidson signs and castoff bras  --  to witness the coyotes ( as the bartenders call themselves ) insult patrons who ordered " froufrou " drinks , perform fire-breathing tricks , and shimmy atop the bar . It was a spontaneous , somewhat combative place , and it bred a fierce loyalty in its regulars and coyotes who fit the ethos . <p> Then in 1997 , GQ published " The Muse of the Coyote Ugly Saloon ; ' a celebratory tale by onetime coyote Elizabeth Gilbert . Soon Disney bought the rights and ber producer Jerry Bruckheimer came calling . In 2000 , audiences shelled out $61 million to see the PG-13 love story about a New Jersey girl who gains confidence working for a tough-but-fair woman named Lil at a dive where the bartenders wear hip-huggers , light the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dance . <p> " I knew right away that I had to be aggressive , " Lovell says . " You do n't get $40 million of free press the cost of the movie and not use it . " <p> HOW TO EXPAND PRESENTED A PROBLEM . Unlike most chains , Coyote Ugly was not famous for its decor or signature dishes but for its attitude ( the name refers to a man so homely that a one-night-stand partner would rather chew off an arm to escape his bed  --  like a trapped coyote  --  than wake him ) . " This is about being a strong woman , " Lovell says . " You 're expected to get on the bar and entertain and serve people , do a show and still make money at the same time . " It was a tough hurdle to clear : Half of the first 400 New York coyotes quit or were fired their first night . Piccirillo recalls a new bartender on duty one quiet evening . When five Wall Streeters stood to leave , Lovell warned the coyote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired . " The bartender ran back , bought the five a round , and danced on the bar . " They stayed for four hours , " says Piccirillo . " You do n't have to accept a bad night . " <p> Gilbert says that her fear of getting on Lovell 's bad side meant that on slow nights she would run out onto the street to round up patrons and , if that did n't work , put $10 or $20 into the till . " You would steal from yourself , " she says . <p> Lovell 's Coyote Ugly is more than a tavern version of Chained Heat , however . At the same time they sass men , the coyotes must make women comfortable enough to come in and get on the bar . " Women customers mean more men customers mean more money , " says Lovell . And Lovell has specific ideas about music ( southern rock ) , drinks ( beer , yes ; martinis , no ) , bartender gender ( female ) , and sales tactics . Coyotes mock patrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons ' mouths ( a " penalty shot " for naughtiness ) , serve shots in their navels ( a " body shot " )  --  and charge for every drop . <p> " It 's a powerful experience to have a woman half your size pull on your hair , tilt your head back , and pour tequila up to your teeth , ' " says Ben Choi , a New York bar patron . It 's lucrative too : " Body shots cost $20 . We give the girl $5 , and we get $15 for what costs us 50 , " says licensee John Cestare . <p> AFTER THE MOVIE RELEASE TOURISTS packed the New York bar demanding a recreation of the Hollywood experience . " There was a backlash , " says Squatriglia . " The regulars got angry when the movie first came out , it was so jammed in here . You could n't blame them . " But there was a financial opportunity in creating bars somewhere between the original 1,500-square-foot dive and the sanitized Hollywood version . So Lovell decided to create larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the songs in the movie  --  ironically , codifying one of the original bar 's most spontaneous practices . <p> Without capital to expand alone , Lovell could either franchise her bar or license the trademark . While franchising would give Lovell control down to decor and drink sizes  --  la McDonald 's  --  it involved expensive and time-eating legal filings . So she chose licensing , which let her anoint licensees but did not allow her to dictate operating procedures . Lovell was n't worried . " At first , Liliana said , ' I do n't want that much control . If they 're coming to me they know what the concept is . They 've seen the movie , ' " says Jeff Wiseman , Ugly Inc. ' s general counsel and a onetime Lovell regular at the Village Idiot . <p> Lovell chose a standard licensing scheme  --  licensees pay $50,000 up front , plus 5% of gross sales and a quarter of merchandise sales . Jennifer Worthington , an associate producer on the movie , bought the rights for Las Vegas , which opened in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Vegas bar is the highest earner  --  $14 million a year ; Atlanta , at $1.5 million , is the lowest ) . Around the same time , Cestare , a 31-year-old club promoter , dropped by the Manhattan bar to see if he could cut a deal . He offered between $2 million and $3 million for U.S. rights ( Lovell laughed at him ) , eventually settling for four cities  --  Chicago , Atlanta , Boston , and San Diego . Lovell herself renovated a bar of her own at a cost of $1.4 million in New Orleans , where she lives with Piccirillo , a screenwriter , and their four-year-old son . <p> THE LACK OF FRANCHISE REGULATIONS MADE VETTING licensees that much more important . After deciding which cities had the right demographics ( more than a million people in the area , a young population ) , Lovell had potential licensees sign a nondisclosure agreement and visit her in New Orleans for a personality check of sorts . <p> Mike Hudson , a partner in the Dallas bar , describes his visit : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a VIP , I 'm drinking for free tonight . ' But at the end of the night Chantal a coyote said , ' Buy me a shot . ' All I had was $5 . She snatched it out of my hand and did a shot and said , ' Thanks , have a nice night . ' I said , ' I ca n't believe you took my cab fare . ' She eventually gave it back . " <p> Once they 've inked the contract  --  which grants exclusivity within a 75-mile radius and allows Lovell access to bar records  --  they prepare to open . First , they choose a location with Lee Killingsworth , Ugly Inc. ' s director of business development , who scours heavily trafficked locations for high-ceilinged spaces between 2,500 and 8,000 square feet . Once one is picked , Lovell offers decorating advice and a line of merchandise . <p> Then the brand work starts . " The hardest part about licensing is making sure they do n't stray off course , " says Killingsworth , who assembled a 200-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrity birthdays should be celebrated ( think Kid Rock and the late Johnny Cash ) . <p> Then the owners hold tryouts that are judged by Lovell , Squatriglia , and local celebrities . Hundreds of women audition ( normally between 300 and 400 , though Vegas had 700 ) . " I 'm constantly surprised at how popular the movie is . Girls cry because they did n't get the job , " Squatriglia says . After they winnow down the aspirants to 25 or so , Lovell 's crew starts training coyotes and licensees . <p> At the time of the movie Squatriglia turned the bar-top dancing  --  which had been left up to the coyotes  --  into choreographed , copyrighted numbers . For a week the new coyotes toil on three  --  Def Leppard 's " Pour Some Sugar on Me , " the Charlie Daniels Band 's " The Devil Went Down to Georgia " and Tom Jones 's " Sex Bomb "  --  and learn clogging , bartending , and attitude . " There 's a lot of role-playing on what to do , how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Atlanta and three others . " We pretend that we 're dudes and have them say something " According to Olsen , a coyote earns on average between $300 and $400 on a Friday night . <p> SOON , THOUGH , IT BECAME APPARENT that licensing and Lovell did n't mix . Manterola 's was the first of a number of bars ( he eventually closed in summer 2002 ) that either tried to use her brand without paying ( Ugly Inc. spends several hundreds of thousands a year stopping unlicensed bars from using the Coyote Ugly name ) or , once licensed , ran their bars in ways that Lovell did not like . <p> In one instance , Lovell walked into one bar  --  she wo n't say which one  --  and as a test ordered a froufrou drink . That she was served it angered her . " That 's something I 'm totally against " she says . Atlanta and Dallas both toyed with karaoke nights . All Lovell could do was complain . " Liliana will call up , " says Dallas partner Hudson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it . I do n't do that in mine . ' She expresses her disapproval . " <p> Atlanta dropped the practice and while Hudson says that Lovell has accepted his Wednesday-night gig  --  featuring American Idol also-ran Nikki McKibbin  --  the inability to give orders gnawed on her . " I have a decent relationship with my licensees , and I 'd call them up and usually they 'd change what they were doing . But it 's frustrating that they would do things that I would n't , " Lovell says . " Nobody understands Coyote the way I do . " <p> Of course , not every licensee is sanguine about Lovell 's close supervision . Kevin Callanan , a partner in the Philadelphia bar who calls Lovell " a super control freak " points to his coyote tryouts . According to Callanan , because Ugly Inc. booked a theater he could n't fill , he decided to put the celebrity judges onstage and give them microphones . That way , the media cameras could take in the girls and the judges without showing the partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furious , almost to the point of walking out " because she wanted the girls to be alone onstage and did n't want the judges miked in case they were lewd . " She did n't join us in the judging . I have n't spoken with her since , " says Callanan . " When you run a bar for 10 years everybody says yes when you say yes . But when you 're dealing with other successful businesspeople , they question you . I wonder how that is for her . " Lovell disputes Callanan 's claim that she refused to take part in the judging . <p> IN EARLY 2003 LOVELL STOPPED SELLING licenses ( there are eight licensed cities still to open ) . From that point on , Ugly Inc. would take outside investments , even majority stakes , but would maintain managing rights . The first bar to open under this arrangement was Tampa , with Olsen as a partner . There , Lovell got to install a manager despite the fact that she only has a 10% stake . <p> " I 'm learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally thought , " Lovell says . " It 's hard for me to completely commit a project to someone else without being involved in some way . " <p> At some point in her growth , however , Lovell realizes , she will have to trust others to run parts of the show . She plans to do so by hiring people who fit snugly with the Coyote ethos . " You 'll have general managers and regional managers trained by me , " she says . " It 's about me hiring the right people who have the same image of Coyote that I do . " <p> Right now , between 35% and 50% of the patrons are regulars , a key sign that the bars still feel like local hangouts . Lovell says she 's not concerned about central control making her bars cookie-cutter tourist traps because she 's always allowed each bar to reflect its location  --  thus , southern rock on the Dallas jukebox and Eminem in Atlanta . <p> It even appears that Lovell is learning the first lessons in stepping back . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing that she is able to get involved , without her always doing so . " We only talk about once a month , " says Olsen . " She 's not in on every little thing . " <p> Still , do n't get Lovell wrong . While she may ease her grip from white-knuckle to firm , the old equation still holds . <p> " At the end of the day , this is my company and Coyote Ugly is going to be as strong as I make it , " says Lovell . " When I have 1001 want you to be able to go to London and have as good a time as when you went to New Orleans or New York . " <p> And that good time you 're having ? It will be on her terms . <p> NO HOLDS BARRED : " I KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT I HAD TO BE AGGRESSIVE , " SAYS LOVELL , HERE AT HER COYOTE UGLY SALOON IN NEW ORLEANS . <p> DIRTY PRETTY THINGS : SQUATRIGLIA ( SEATED ) AND COYOTES ( FROM LEFT ) VINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO SERVE , ENTERTAIN , AND MAKE MONEY . <p> By Ian Mount <p> <p> Ian Mount is a freelance writer living in New York City .
