Swan Sister Fairy Tales Retold By Datlow , Ellen Simon &; Schuster Children 's Publishing Datlow , Ellen Introduction by Terri Windling and Ellen Datlow When we were kids , we were told that fairy tales were only for little children - which implies , of course , that we 'd lose our interest as we grew up . But we kept on reading fairy tales year after year , and they were just as wonderful as ever . Was there something wrong with us , we wondered , that we were so enchanted by nursery stories ? And why , we wondered , were fairy tales considered suitable for little children anyway ? Some of the stories we read in the Brothers Grimm volumes seemed grim indeed ! There were queens who danced to death in red-hot shoes , wicked witches burned up in ovens , ghostly children weeping blood red tears , and wolves lurking in Granny 's nightclothes . Eventually we learned that in previous centuries fairy tales were n't considered children 's stories - back then , they were told to everyone , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries , certain book editors , as well as the Walt Disney Studios , took hold of fairy tales and changed them . They turned harrowing , suspenseful stories into sweet and simple tales full of frolicking bluebirds , giggling mice , square-jawed heroes , and dumb-blonde princesses . In these new versions of fairy tales the Good were always unambiguously Good , and they always triumphed over Evil . Real life , however , is more complex than that . The old fairy tales were more complex than that too . Underneath their fanciful trappings , the old tales had a lot to say about human nature : about cruelty , vanity , greed , despair - and about the " magic " that overcomes them : kindness , compassion , generosity , faith , persistence , and courage . Back in the seventeenth-century France there was a group of writers in Paris who loved those older , complex stories . And so they made it into a game , as they sat together in their elegant salons , to retell traditional fairy tales in clever , interesting new ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best today are versions first told in French salons , such as Charles Perrault 's " Cinderella , " complete with fairy godmother and rats turned into coachmen . Sometimes two writers would choose the same tale , and each would rewrite it in his or her own way - and then the other salonnires would decide who 'd done it best . Today , three hundred years later , many of us still love playing this game - trying to discover fresh new ways to retell beloved old stories . The authors in this book are also people who never outgrew their childhood love of fairy tales - as adults , they 're still reading magical stories , and writing them too . For this collection ( the sequel to our previous book A Wolf at the Door ) , we asked writers to send us brand-new stories based on older tales - fairy tales , folklore , legends , and even old folk ballads . You 'll find new versions of " Bluebeard , " " Rapunzel , " " The Fisherman 's Wife , " " Tom Thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven Swans ; " as well as two works based on The Arabian Nights ; two different versions of " Red Riding Hood ; " a story inspired by " Greenman " legends ; and one Celtic folk song . Each of these authors has taken traditional material and fashioned it into something of his or her own - just as those French writers did in Paris three hundred years ago . Who knows ? Maybe three hundred years from now groups of writers will still be telling these stories . We hope so . Because there will always be readers who do n't outgrow their love of magic .
