/Jan 2000 Danny Bronson 's more wants to see him write something . He 's almost seven and in grade one . She knows he must be able to write some words , but she 's never seen him do it . " Come on , Danny , " she says , playfully . " Write your mother a word . Any word . How about hello ? I bet you can write that one . " Danny looks at her briefly , picks up the pencil and paper and gets to work . After a minute or so he hands her the paper . " There , " he says , with just a touch of a smirk on his face . She looks at the paper . Danny has drawn a picture of a devil followed by the letters l and o . Justin and Jordan Bradley are looking at Dr. Seuss 's ABC with their more , taking turns reading the letters . The four-year-old twins both know the alphabet , but for some reason , on this day Jordan has trouble recognizing the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , Mommy , " he says . " Sure you do , " chirps his ever-helpful brother . " Mmm . Mice . " " Oh , " says Jordan . " Mmm . Mommy . It 's m ! " These children are at different stages , but all are showing clear signs they will be good readers . Even if she were n't a teacher , Laurie Bradley , who lives in Moosomin , Saskatchewan , would be able to see that her twins are progressing nicely . They love books , they pretend to read while playing , they ask questions about highway signs , they can spot individual letters in the newspaper and they know a few words by sight . Justin and Jordan have figured out the relationship between letters , sounds and words . They know words are a kind of code , where letters stand for sounds and the sounds are put together to make words . Danny , three years older , has reached the point where he can humour his mother by substituting a symbol for some letters . His parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say their son has not been a precocious reader , but it 's come together for him this year . They know of other kids who read earlier , but they never worried about Danny . Why not ? His father thinks for a minute . " Well , he 's always had such good language skills . He read when he was ready , I guess . For a long time reading was n't necessarily his thing , but words definitely were . " Reading is a key tool for acquiring knowledge , not to mention a lifelong source of pleasure . We all want our kids to be successful readers , but in the preschool years , especially with a first child , there 's always some uncertainty . Will my child be a good reader ? Is there anything I can do to help him now ? If you read to your child regularly , you already know most of the answers to the second question . Linda Harnett , a kindergarten teacher for 24 years in Mount Pearl , Newfoundland , says , " There no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in a child 's learning to read is being read to at home . Children who have been read to see a lot of print in their lives and they know it 's important . They come to school assuming they 'll be learning to read , and are eager to do so . " The first question  --  Will my child be a good reader ?  --  is trickier . We ca n't answer it for any individual , but research is beginning to unveil the skills that kids need before they can learn to read . Most of them parents can recognize and foster at home before their child enters school . Some signs of pre-reading progress are simple : knowing which way to hold a book , knowing your ABCs and colours , pretending to read and write ( purposeful scribbling ) . Another milestone is being able to tell the difference between print and pictures . Bradley recalls getting a clear sign that her boys were aware of that distinction . " I was reading a book where the picture was on one page and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the picture as I read and Jordan said , " Mommy , you ca n't read that part because there are no words . ' Then he moved my hand to the page that had the words . " We tend to think of reading as primarily a visual task . However , one significant set of pre-reading skills has more to do with hearing than seeing . It 's what experts refer to as phonological awareness or , as Deborah Berrill , a professor of education at Trent University , puts it , understanding the sound structure of language . " To be able to read , children first need to understand that language conveys meaning , and then that it can be broken down into components like syllables and phonemes units of sound like the ch sound in chair , or the a sound in bake . " Recent research has demonstrated that this awareness is a precursor to fluent reading . Wayne MacDonald , a neuropsychologist at IWK Grace Hospital in Halifax , tested kindergarten students using what is known as a phonemic deletion task . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again deleting one of the phonemes ( " Say meat . Now say it without the m sound " ) . MacDonald found that the ability of five-year-olds to do this correlated with their reading ability ; that is , the kids who could do the task well were those with good reading skills . Here 's the interesting part . Eleven years later , MacDonald tracked down and tested 30 of the 70 students from the original study , who by then were in grade 11 . He found that their scores on the phonemic deletion test as five-year-olds predicted their current reading ability . " It was more predictive of grade-11 reading level than another more conventional reading test we also gave them when they were in kindergarten , " MacDonald says . Being able to detect beginning and end consonant sounds  --  the c in cat or the g in jug  --  is only one skill . Another is the ability to hear and make up rhymes . Linda Siegel , a professor of educational psychology at UBC , has done research to see if the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that five-year-olds who ca n't do phonemic deletion tasks , make up and hear rhymes or name the letters of the alphabet , are likely to have difficulties later . " It 's not the lack of any one of the skills that seems to matter , it 's the lack of all of them put together that predict problems learning to read , " she says . Siegel and MacDonald caution that this is work in progress . We still do n't have a generally accepted early warning test for reading problems . ( For the record , reversing letters is not an indicator of a learning disability in preschoolers . MacDonald says this falls within the range of normal variation in the pre-reading period and , in some normal children , may continue until age six . ) However , these findings suggest a couple of take-home messages for the average family . First , what happens before children enter school is at least as important as what happens at school . Berrill notes , " We know that most children who come well prepared  --  that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich language experiences  --  take to reading with little difficulty . " That does n't necessarily mean children have learning disabilities because they were n't read to enough , nor does it mean that all children who are read to are guaranteed success . " Most youngsters develop phonological awareness on their own , " MacDonald explains , " but a subgroup of average children seems to need more help . " The second implication of this research is that it 's not just reading to a preschooler that matters , it 's what you read . Harnett and others encourage parents to make sure at least some of their children 's language experiences  --  not just reading , but talking , singing and making funny sounds  --  are " sound-rich . " " I 've had students from average homes who are enthusiastic about reading and have obviously been read to , but they seem not to have gone through all the steps , " says Harnett . " They ca n't rhyme or they do n't know all of the alphabet , or they know the alphabet , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , I think a learning disability may show up later on . Sometimes it seems they have n't been exposed to books with lots of repetitive rhyme and alliteration . Often they 've tended to choose books based on movies . " We know the books she 's talking about . Many of us have them on the bookshelf , and while they are fine as part of the overall picture , Harnett says they do little to help children learn about how sounds work in language . " Those books are n't as expressive , they do n't have the interesting rhythm and some of the language is n't appropriate to a young child 's level of literacy . " What are the good books ? We know them as well . Harnett favours authors who delight in playing with language ( see " Best Books for Preschoolers , " above ) . Consider the following rhyming couplet from Jillian Jiggs , by Phoebe Gilman : " Jillian Jillian Jillian Jiggs / It looks like your room has been lived in by pigs . " It 's funny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and love of language . But it also repeats phonemes . The j sound is repeated four times , and the rhyming structure reinforces the igs sound . That couplet itself is repeated three times over the course of the story . This repetition of sound and rhyme helps children develop what MacDonald calls their internal sound system . " Kids have to understand all the sounds , and also the rules for how sounds are blended , " he says . " If they hear the sounds over and over again , in all kinds of interesting ways , it helps them develop the ability to transform what they hear into sound symbols . Then they are ready for the direct instruction of letter-sound relationships at school . " By the way , it 's not just books . Many parents sense the importance of reading to their kids early  --  even in utero . That 's fine , MacDonald says , " but let 's not forget that learning about sound and language begins with baby-talk " conversations " we have with infants . " Nursery rhymes , songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Danny Bronson and his sisters read lots of books and listened to all kinds of children 's music . But much of Danny 's early experience with words came as a storyteller . " When Danny was three or four , he 'd get me to draw pictures to his exacting specifications and then tell me the stories to go with them , " says his father . Danny would then write squiggles on the picture to record the story . When he was a little older he 'd sit at the computer and dictate great long tales ( some of them six pages long ) , which his adult cousin would dutifully input for him . This pathway may be unconventional , but Berrill says it demonstrates something important . " This little boy knew that words had power . " Of course , you do n't have to dictate 2,000-word stories at the age of four , she says . " Making a shopping list , even if it 's scribbles or invented spellings , accomplishes much the same thing . " The Bronsons " three-year-old daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's paying bills . She also pretends to fill out forms when she 's at the bank . " She likes putting things into envelopes , " her dad says . " She knows those are business things , and they 're important . " Harnett approves . " It 's not drills that are required . It 's the songs and the rhymes , and writing down the story they tell you to go with the picture they drew . It 's making their own little books , or asking them to predict what 's going to happen next in a story you 're reading . Overall , it 's about stimulating and motivating the child to love language and want to use it . " Although he has n't put all the pieces together yet , young Justin knows that words have power , too . " Once we stopped at a paint store with my mother , " Laurie Bradley recalls . " She went in to get something while we waited in the car . Justin noticed the closed sign in the door of the store that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mommy that 's a c . That means kids are n't allowed . Do n't you just hate that ? ' ' " What You Can Do at Home In addition to sharing storytime , many other activities  --  drawing , painting , doing jigsaw puzzles , playing with magnetic letters on the fridge  --  help prepare preschoolers for reading in ways you may not have considered . For example , matching games help children with symbol recognition , while exploring sounds and letters with touch can teach phonological awareness . Here are a few suggestions to try at home , in the car or waiting in line at the grocery store : - Play " concentration " with ordinary playing cards : Place the cards face down and take turns trying to find matching pairs . With three- or four-year-olds , start out with just five or six pairs and let them turn cards over until they find a match . Eventually you can work toward turning over just two at a time and having to remember the location of previously turned-up cards . - Have children draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cut some letters out of sandpaper and have them trace the letter with their finger . - Put small objects in a bag and have kids identify them only through touch . When they 've mastered this , ask them to find objects that begin with a certain sound . - Ask children to clap their hands to the rhythm of words . - Play with words by speaking in slow exaggerated syllables  --  baaanaaanaaa  --  or by stuttering the initial sound : p-p-p-pepper. - Play " one of these words is not like the other . " Say , " I 'm going to say some words and you tell me which one does n't begin with p  --  pen , pot , sand , pink . " Or say series of words like " hop , pop , top , ball " and ask your child which one does n't rhyme . Best Books for Preschoolers Wan na know a secret ? The books that best prepare kids for reading are also the ones parents and kids tend to like anyway . So , when we asked our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few surprises . Halifax neuropsychologist Wayne MacDonald says nursery rhymes are a perfect place to start . He also likes Dennis Lee ( Jelly Belly , Alligator Pie ) and Sheree Fitch ( Sleeping Dragons All Around , Toes in My Nose ) . Linda Siegel , professor of educational psychology at UBC , recommends anything by Dr. Seuss ( Green Eggs and Ham , The Cat in the Hat ) or Robert Munsch ( Angela 's Airplane , Mortimer ) . Kindergarten teacher Linda Harnett loves Bill Martin , Jr . ( Chicka Chicka Boom Boom ; Brown Bear , Brown Bear , What Do You See ? ) ; Alan Baker 's Little Rabbit Books ( Black and White Rabbit 's ABC , White Rabbit 's Color Book ) ; Audrey and Don Wood ( Piggies , The Napping House ) ; and Eric Carle ( The Very Hungry Caterpillar , The Very Busy Spider ) . <p>
