The last time I saw Cassandra . . . I was about to say : the last time I saw Cassandra was on the day of her death . But that would be untrue . The last time I saw her -- gazed upon her face , ran my fingers over her golden hair , dared to touch her cold cheek -- was on her funeral day . It was I who made all the arrangements . There was no one else to do it . No one else came forward to claim her body . I call her Cassandra , but that was not her real name , of course . No parents would ever give a child such an accursed name , any more than they would name a baby Medea or Medusa or Cyclops . Nor would any master give such an ill-omened name to a slave . Others called her Cassandra because of the special gift they believed her to possess . Like the original Cassandra , the doomed princess of ancient Troy , it seemed that our Cassandra could foretell the future . Little good that accursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She called herself what others called her , Cassandra , saying she could no longer remember her real name or who her parents were or where she came from . Some thought the gods had given her glimpses of the future to compensate for robbing her of the past . Someone else robbed her of the present . Someone snuffed out the flame that burned inside her and lit her with an inner glow such as I have seen in no other mortal . Someone murdered Cassandra . As I said , it fell to me to make the funeral arrangements . No outraged friend or lover , no grieving parent or sibling came forward to claim her . The young man who had been her sole companion , the mute she called Rupa -- bodyguard , servant , relative , lover ?  - -  vanished when she was murdered . For three days her body rested on a bier in the foyer of my house on the Palatine Hill . The embalmers clothed her in white and surrounded her with pine branches to scent the air . Her killer had done nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Drained of color , Cassandra 's smooth cheeks and tender lips took on a waxen , opalescent quality , as if she were carved from translucent white marble . The hair that framed her face looked like hammered gold , cold and hard to the touch . By day , illuminated by sunbeams that poured through the atrium skylight , she looked no more alive than a white marble statue . But each night , while the rest of the household slept , I stole from my wife 's bed and crept to the foyer to gaze at Cassandra 's body . There were times -- strange moments such as occur only in the middle of the night , when the mind is weary and flickering lamplight plays tricks on an old man 's eyes-when it seemed hardly possible that the body on the bier could be truly dead . The lamplight infused Cassandra 's face with a warm glow . Her hair shimmered with highlights of red and yellow . It seemed that at any moment she might open her eyes and part her lips to draw a quickening breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers , but I drew back with a shudder , for they were as cold and unresponsive as the lips of a statue . I placed a black wreath on my door . Such wreaths are a warning in one sense , alerting others to the presence of death in the household , but in another sense they issue an invitation : come , pay your final respects . But not a single visitor came to view Cassandra 's body . Not even one of those compulsive gossips came to pester us , the type who make the rounds of the city looking for wreaths and knocking on doors of people they 've never met , just to have a look at the latest corpse so they can deliver an opinion on the embalmers ' handiwork . I alone mourned Cassandra . Perhaps , I thought , death and funerals had become too commonplace in Rome for the passing of a single woman of unknown family , commonly thought to be as mad as-well , as mad as Cassandra-to excite any interest . The whole world was swept up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . Warriors were dying by the hundreds and thousands on land and on sea . Despairing wives were wasting into oblivion . Ruined debtors were found hanging from rafters . Greedy speculators were stabbed in their sleep . All was ruin , and the future promised only more death and suffering on a scale never known before by humankind . Beautiful Cassandra , who 'd haunted the streets of Rome uttering shrill , crazy prophecies , was dead -- and no one cared enough to come and see her body . And yet , someone had cared enough to murder her . When the period of mourning was done , I summoned the strongest of my household slaves to lift the bier onto their shoulders . The members of my household formed the funeral cortege , except for my wife , Bethesda , who had been ill for quite some time and was not well enough to go out that day . In her place my daughter , Diana , walked beside me , and beside her walked her husband , Davus . Behind us walked my son Eco and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now old enough , at eleven , to understand the somber nature of the occasion . Hieronymus the Massilian , who had been residing in my house since his arrival in Rome the previous year , also came ; he had suffered much in his life and had known the pain of being outcast , so I think he felt a natural bond of sympathy with Cassandra . My household slaves , few in number , followed , among them the brothers Androcles and Mopsus , who were not quite as old as Eco 's children . For once , sensing the gravity of the occasion , they behaved themselves . So that all would be done fittingly , I hired three musicians to lead the procession . They played a mournful dirge , one blowing a horn and another a flute , while the third shook a bronze rattle . My neighbors in their stately houses on the Palatine heard them coming from a distance and either closed their shutters , irritated at the noise , or opened them , curious to have a look at the funeral party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four , the most I could afford considering the state of my finances , even though they worked cheaply . I suppose there was no shortage of women in Rome who could draw upon their own tragedies to produce tears for a woman they had never known . These four had worked together on previous occasions and performed with admirable professionalism . They shivered and wept , shuffled and staggered but never collided , pulled at their tangled hair , and took turns chanting the refrain of the playwright Naevius 's famous epitaph : " ' If the death of any mortal saddens hearts immortal , the gods above must weep at this woman 's death . . . . ' " Next came the mime . I had debated whether to hire one , but in the end it seemed proper . I had been told he came from Alexandria and was the best man in Rome for this sort of thing . He wore a mask with feminine features , a blond wig , and a blue tunica such as Cassandra wore . I myself had coached him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part his gestures were too broad and generic , but every so often , whether by accident or design , he struck an attitude that epitomized Cassandra to an uncanny degree and sent a shiver through me . Funeral mimes are usually allowed a great deal of latitude to caricature and gently lampoon their subject , but I had forbidden this ; it is one thing to sketch a loving parody of a deceased patriarch or a public figure , but too little was known about Cassandra 's life to offer fodder for humor . Still , the mime could not offer a portrait of her without imitating the one thing that everyone would recall about her : her fits of prophecy . Every so often , he suddenly convulsed and spun about , then threw back his head and let out a strange , unnerving ululation . It was not an exact imitation of the real thing , only a suggestion-not even remotely as frightening or uncanny as the real Cassandra 's episodes of possession by the god-but it was close enough to cause any bystanders who had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market to nod and say to themselves , So that 's who 's lying upon that funeral bier . Directly after the mime came Cassandra herself , carried aloft and ensconced amid fresh flowers and evergreen boughs , her arms crossed over her chest and her eyes closed as if she slept . After Cassandra came the members of my household , marching in solemn procession for a woman none of them but myself had actually known . We strode slowly past the great houses on the Palatine and then down into the region of the Subura , where the narrow streets teemed with life . Even in these impious days , when men scorn the gods and the gods scorn us in return , people pay their respects when a funeral passes by . They stopped squabbling or gossiping or bargaining , shut their mouths , and stood aside to let the dead and the mourning pass . Often , as a funeral cortege makes its way through Rome , others join the retinue , inspired to pay their respects by following along behind the family and adding to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous and powerful , and often even with those of the humble , if they were well-known and well liked in the community . But on that day , no one joined us . Whenever I looked over my shoulder , I saw only a gap behind the last of our retinue , and then the crowd closing ranks behind us , turning their attention away from the passing spectacle and getting back to their business . And yet , we were observed , and we were followed-as I soon would discover . At length , we came to the Esquiline Gate . Passing through its portals , we stepped from the city of the living into the city of the dead . Sprawling over the gently sloping hillsides , as far as the eye could see , was the public necropolis of Rome . Here the unmarked graves of slaves and the modest tombs of common citizens were crowded close together . Ours was not the only funeral that day . Here and there , plumes of smoke from funeral pyres rose into the air , scenting the necropolis with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way off the road , atop a small hill , the pyre for Cassandra had already been prepared . While her bier was being laid upon it and the keepers of the flame set about stoking the fire , I stepped into the Temple of Venus Libitina , where the registry of deaths is kept . The clerk who attended me was officious and sullen from the moment he slammed his record book onto the counter that separated us . I told him I wanted to register a death . He opened the hinged wooden diptych with its inlaid wax tablets and took up his stylus . " Citizen , slave , or foreigner ? " he asked curtly . " I 'm not sure . " " Not sure ? " He looked at me as if I had entered the temple with the specific intention of wasting his time . " I did n't really know her . No one seems to have known her . " " Not part of your household ? " " No . I 'm only attending to her funeral because- " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure . " He slammed shut his record book and brandished his stylus at me . " Then go away and do n't come back until you are sure . " I reached across the counter and grabbed the front of his tunic in my fist . " She died four days ago , here in Rome , and you will enter her death into the registry . " The clerk blanched . " Certainly , " he squeaked . It was only as I gradually released him that I realized how hard I had been clutching his tunic . His face was red , and it took him a moment to catch his breath . He made a show of reasserting his dignity , straightening his tunic , and slicking back his hair . With great punctiliousness , he opened his register and pressed his stylus to the wax . " Name of the deceased ? " he asked , his voice breaking . He coughed to clear his throat . " I 'm not sure , " I said . His mouth twitched . He bit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nevertheless , I have to put down something for a name . " " Put down Cassandra , then . " " Very well . " He pressed the letters crisply into the hard wax . " Her place of origin ? " " I told you , 1 do n't know . " He clicked his tongue . " But I have to put something . If she was a Roman citizen , I have to know her family name ; and if she was married , her husband 's name . If she was a foreigner , I have to know where she came from . If she was a slave --  " " Then write , ' Origin unknown . ' " He opened his mouth to speak then thought better of it . " Highly irregular , " he muttered , as he wrote what I told him . " I do n't suppose you know the date of her birth ? " I glowered at him . " I see . ' Birthdate unknown , ' then . And the date of her death ? Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She died on the Nones of Sextilis . " " And the cause of her death ? " " Poison , " I said , through gritted teeth . " She was poisoned . " " I see , " he said , showing no emotion and hurriedly scribbling . " With a name like Cassandra , " he said under his breath , " you might think she 'd have seen it coming . And what is your name ? I have to have it to complete the record . " I felt another impulse to strike him , but resisted . " Gordianus , called the Finder . " " Very well , then . There , I 've written the entry just as you wished . ' Name of deceased : Cassandra . Family and status unknown . Birthdate unknown . Death by poison on the Nones of Sextilis , Year of Rome 706 . Reported by Gordianus , called the Finder . ' Does that satisfy you , citizen ? " I said nothing and walked away , toward the pillars that flanked the entrance . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Perhaps he should find out who poisoned her . . . . " I walked down the temple steps and back toward the funeral pyre , staring at the ground , seeing nothing . I felt the heat of the fire as I drew closer ; and when I finally lifted my eyes , I beheld Cassandra amid the flames . Her bier had been tilted upright so that the funeral party could view the final moments of her physical existence . The musicians quickened their tempo from a mournful dirge to a shrill lament . The hired mourners dropped to their knees , pounded their fists against the earth , screamed and wailed . A gust of wind suddenly whipped the flames higher . The roar of the fire was punctuated with loud cracking and popping and sizzling noises . While I watched , the flames gradually consumed her , frizzling her hair , withering and charring her flesh , turning everything black , destroying her beauty forever . The wind blew smoke in my eyes , stinging them , filling them with tears . I tried to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this awful spectacle constituted one more moment , one final chance to look upon Cassandra . I reached into my toga and pulled out a short baton made of leather . It had belonged to Cassandra ; it was the only one of her possessions that still existed . I clutched it in my fist for a moment , then hurled it into the flames . I felt Diana 's presence beside me , then the touch of her hand on my arm . " Papa , look . " I finally tore my eyes from the funeral pyre . I looked blankly at my daughter 's face . Her eyes -- so beloved , so vibrantly alive -- met mine , then turned elsewhere . I followed her gaze . We were no longer alone . Others had come to witness Cassandra 's end . They must have arrived while I was in the temple or staring at the flames . The separate groups stood well away from the fire , scattered in a semicircle behind us . There were seven entourages in all . I looked at each in turn , hardly able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthiest , most powerful , most remarkable women in Rome had come to the necropolis to see Cassandra burn . They had not joined in the public funeral procession , yet here they were , each woman seated in a litter surrounded by her own retinue of relatives , bodyguards , and litter bearers , not one of them acknowledging the presence of any of the others , all keeping their distance from ourselves and from each other , each gazing steadily straight ahead at the funeral pyre . I took stock of them , looking from left to right . First , there was Terentia , the pious , always proper wife of Cicero . With her husband off in Greece to side with Pompey in the civil war , Terentia was said to be hard-pressed to make ends meet , and in fact her litter was the most modest . The draperies that surrounded the box were no longer white but shabby gray , with tatters here and there . But her litter was also the largest , and squinting , 1 made out two other women in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the apple of Cicero 's eye . The other was farther back in the shadows , but from her distinctive clothing and headdress , I saw she was a Vestal Virgin . No doubt it was Fabia , Terentia 's sister , who in younger days had very nearly met her end for breaking her sacred vow of chastity . In the next litter I saw Antonia , the cousin and wife of Marc Antony , Caesar 's right-hand man . While Caesar had been off fighting his enemies in Spain , Antony had been left in charge of Italy . Now both men had departed for northern Greece to do battle with Pompey . Antonia was said to be a very attractive woman . I had never formally met her and might not have recognized her except for the bronze lions ' heads that surmounted the upright supports at each corner of her litter . The lion 's head was Antony 's symbol . Her presence was all the more remarkable because of the woman whose litter was next in the semicircle . Anyone in Rome would have recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cytheris , the actress , always made a show of her comings and goings . She was Antony 's lover , and he had made no secret of that fact while he ruled Rome in Caesar 's absence , traveling all over Italy with her . People called her his understudy-wife . Cytheris was famous for her beauty , though I myself had never seen her close enough to get a good look . Those who had seen her perform in mime shows for her former master , Volumnius the banker , said she was talented as well , able by the subtlest gestures and expressions to evoke a whole range of responses in her audience-lust not least among them . She and Antonia cast not a single glance in each other 's direction , apparently oblivious of one another . I looked to the next litter , which was draped in shades of deepest blue and black suitable for mourning , and recognized Fulvia , the twice-widowed . She had been married first to Clodius , the radical politician and rabble-rouser . After his murder four years ago on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the Republic , it seemed in retrospect -- Fulvia had eventually remarried , joining her fortunes to Caesar 's beloved young lieutenant , Gaius Curio . Only a few months ago , word had arrived from Africa of Curio 's disastrous end ; his head had become a trophy for King Juba . Some called Fulvia the unluckiest woman in Rome , but having met her , I knew her to possess an indomitable spirit . Seated with her in her litter was her mother , Sempronia , from whom Fulvia had inherited that spirit . As I moved my eyes to the occupant of the next litter , the incongruities multiplied . There , reclining amid mounds of cushions in a typically voluptuous pose , was Fausta , the notoriously promiscuous daughter of the dictator Sulla . Thirty years after his death , the dictator 's brief , blood-soaked reign still haunted Rome . ( Some predicted that whoever triumphed in the current struggle , Caesar or Pompey , would follow Sulla 's merciless example and line the Forum with the heads of his enemies . ) Sulla 's ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to haunt the more dissolute gatherings in the city . Fausta was still married , though in name only , to the banished gang leader Milo , the one political exile whom Caesar had pointedly excluded from the generous pardons he 'd issued before leaving Rome . Milo 's unforgivable crime had been the murder four years ago of his hated rival Clodius on the Appian Way . According to the court , it was Fausta 's husband who had made a widow ( for the first time ) of Fulvia . Were the two women aware of one another 's presence ? If they were , they gave no more indication of it than did Antonia and Cytheris . At that moment Milo was very much on everyone 's mind , for he had escaped from exile and was said to be raising an insurrection in the countryside . What did Fausta know about that ? Why was she here at Cassandra 's funeral ? Next to Fausta 's litter , surrounded by the largest retinue of bodyguards , was a resplendent canopy with ivory poles and white draperies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the litter of great Caesar 's wife , Calpurnia . Now that Marc Antony had left Rome to fight alongside Caesar , many thought it was Calpurnia who functioned as the eyes and ears of her husband in his absence . Caesar had married her ten years ago , purely for political advantage some said , because in Calpurnia he had found a woman to match his own ambition . She was said to be an uncommonly hardheaded woman with no time for superstition . Why had she come to witness the funeral of a mad seeress ? One litter remained , a little farther off than all the others . When my eyes fell on it , my heart skipped a beat . Its occupant could n't be seen , except for a finger that parted the closed drapes just enough for her to see out . But I knew that litter , with its red-and-white stripes , all too well . Eight years ago its occupant had been one of the most public women in Rome , notorious for her flamboyance and high spirits . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made the grave mistake of crossing Cicero . The result had been a disastrous public humiliation from which she had never recovered . Then her brother ( some said lover ) Clodius met his end on the Appian Way , and her spirit seemed to have been snuffed out altogether . She had retreated into a seclusion so complete that some thought she must be dead . She was the one woman in Rome-before Cassandra who had threatened to break my heart . What was Clodia -- beautiful , enigmatic Clodia , once the most dangerous woman in Rome , now all but forgotten -- doing there that day , lurking incognito amid the litters of the other women ? I gazed from litter to litter , my head spinning . To see these particular women all gathered in one place at one time was more than remarkable ; it was astounding . And yet , there they all were , their various litters scattered before the burning pyre like the pavilions of contending armies arrayed on a field of battle . Terentia , Antonia , Cytheris , Fulvia , Fausta , Calpurnia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why had they come ? To mourn Cassandra ? To curse her ? To gloat ? The distance made it impossible to read the expressions on their faces . Beside me , Diana crossed her arms and took on the hard , shrewd look so familiar to me from her mother . " It must have been one of them , " she said . " You know it must have been one of those women who murdered her . " I felt a chill , despite the heat of the flames . I blinked at a sudden swirl of smoke and cinders and turned to look again at the burning pyre . The fire had consumed yet more of Cassandra , had taken another portion of her away from me , and I had missed it . I opened my eyes wide despite the burning smoke . I stared at the blackened remains upon the upright bier reduced now to a bed of glowing coals . The musicians played their shrill lament . The mourners raised their cry to heaven . How long I stared at the flames , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look behind me again , all seven of the women with their litters and their entourages had vanished as if they had never been there .
