Although research into coaching has increased considerably during the last two decades , an area of relative neglect has been that of the professional youth coach . Consequently the aim of this study was to examine and compare the working behaviors of eight top-level English professional youth coaches from both the Premier and Nationwide Leagues , thus contributing to the expanding empirical database about what good youth coaches actually do . The Arizona State University Observation Instrument ( A.S.U.O.I. ) was used as the data gathering instrument , with each coach being observed for a total of 135 minutes . Although significant differences were found in certain behaviors when compared across the leagues , the results tended to echo those of previous research emphasizing the pre-dominant use of instructional behaviors , the use of praise , and the use of silence as a conscious coaching strategy . <p> It is generally agreed that coaching is a process that primarily aids athletes achieve their peak performance in competition ( Woodman , 1993 ; Bompa , 1994 ) . To fulfil this objective the coach is engaged in a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast array of skills to a range of problems ( Abraham &; Collins , 1998 ; Lyle , 1993 ; More , McGary , Partridge &; Franks , 1996 ) . Indeed , the complexity of the task is underlined by Jones , Housner and Kornspan ( 1997 ) who identified 37 standards to describe the coaching process , confirming the assertion that the requirements of effective coaching are both wide ranging and specialized ( Blundell , 1985 ) . Furthermore , it has become increasingly acknowledged that regardless of the level of knowledge and skill of the coach , it is the application of that knowledge and skill which separates the excellent practitioner from the average ( Woodman , 1993 ) . Crucial to enhancing performance therefore , is how the coach facilitates learning in the athlete ; a central tenet of which is the coach 's instructional behavior ( DeMarco , Mancini &; West , 1996 ; More &; Franks , 1996 ) . <p> Tinning ( 1982 ) contends that critical to understanding the nature of instruction is observation , as observational analysis assists in providing information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1996 ) . Indeed , it is only through knowing about coaching behaviors and practices , that theorizing about current limitations becomes possible ( Abraham &; Collins , 1998 ; Cooper &; MacIntyre , 1996 ) . Therefore , to assist in the development of any model of effective coaching , detailed investigations to find out what good coaches actually do , need to be undertaken ( Jones , 1997 ; Millard , 1996 ; Trudel , Cote &; Bernard , 1996 ) . <p> This need has been widely recognized , resulting in an expansion , during the last 25 years , of empirical research into coaching ( Abraham &; Collins , 1998 ; Woodman , 1993 ) . Despite this interest however , until recently , an understanding and appreciation of the coach 's behavior has not kept pace with research related to the performer and performance enhancement ( Jones , 1997 ; Lyle , 1992 ) . Indeed , Liukkonen , Laasko and Telama ( 1996 ) contend that this performance first approach has lead to coach education programs predominantly stressing bio-scientific methods to promote athletic achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this " preoccupation with the input aspect of coaching " ( Crawford , 1980 , p.48 ) , more recent investigations have increasingly studied overt coach behaviors , acknowledging the assumption that through their words and actions , coaches influence both the athletes ' performances and their social and emotional well being ( Horn , 1992 ; Miller , 1992 ; De Marco et al. , 1996 ; Jones , et al. , 1997 ) . Most research to date from this angle has followed a behaviorist approach , where coaching actions are analysed by the use of an assay , usually systematic observation ( Abraham &; Collins , 1998 ) . Here , behaviors that are believed to mimic the action of the coach are specified and clearly defined prior to analysis , resulting in systematic observation being utilized to obtain quantitative data regarding coach behavior . This research has resulted in a wealth of information on the type and quality of instruction ( De Marco et al. , 1996 ) , while many authors have stressed its importance in establishing an empirical base for the development of coaching theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1990 ; Potrac , Jones &; Armour , 1997 ) . <p> A number of observation systems have been developed specifically to analyze coaching behavior , including the Coach Behavior Assessment System ( Smith , Smoll &; Hunt , 1977 ) and the Arizona State University Observation Instrument ( Lacy &; Darst , 1989 ) among others ( Crossman , 1985 ; Langsdorf , 1979 ; Quaterman , 1980 ; Tharp &; Gallimore , 1976 ) . The insights yielded from such tools have contributed greatly to the body of knowledge in sport pedagogy ( De Marco , et al. , 1996 ; Jones , 1997 ) , while some have argued that " the emergence and widespread use of descriptive analytical techniques has provided the beginnings of a science of coaching " ( Lombardo , Faraone &; Pothier , 1983 , p. 4 ) . Consequently , a wide range of literature currently exists describing coach behavior in a range of sports ( Claxton , 1988 ; Lacy , 1989 ; Lacy &; Darst , 1985 ; Lacy &; Goldston 1990 ; Salminen &; Luikkonen , 1995 ; Seagrave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Sariscany , 1991 ) including soccer ( Miller , 1992 ; Potrac el al , , 1997 ; Vangucci , Potrac &; Jones , 1997 ; Millard , 1996 ) . This research has tended to produce consistent results , with instruction being the most frequently used behavior in college , high school and youth sport contexts ( Solomon , Striegel , Eliot , Heon , &; Maas , 1996 ) . Similarly , Douge and Hastie ( 1993 ) , in a review of coach effectiveness using data derived from systematic observation research , identified such coaches as predominantly ( a ) providing feedback incorporating prompts and ' hustles ' ( b ) providing high levels of correction and re-instruction ( c ) using questioning ( d ) involved in giving instruction , and ( d ) managing the training environment . <p> Whilst acknowledging the need for an extensive database of coaching behaviors , research also suggests that there may be differing coaching models and behaviors according to the sport ( Lacy &; Goldston , 1990 ) . Additionally , these differences may occur across tile varying levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined by individual coach philosophy ( Lacy &; Goldston , 1990 ; Smoll &; Smith , 1984 ; Vangucci , et al. , 1997 ) . Consequently , Lacy and Goldston ( 1990 ) state that to build a meaningful database of behaviors , observational studies should be conducted in a variety of settings . Indeed , to date , the accumulation of behavioral knowledge has largely been focused on amateur sport ( Trudel , Cote &; Donohue , 1993 ) , while its professional counterpart has been somewhat neglected . Thus , the professional arena remains an area for study , where clearly the demands , pressures and goals placed upon coaches differ markedly from those working within the amateur selling . <p> The coach , at any level , is a central figure in the athletic environment , assuming responsibility for the quality and direction of each individual 's sporting experience ( DeMarco et al. , 1996 ) . The youth coach , particularly at the elite professional level , has a specialized task , where expectations and demands for both performer and coach are unique , specifically in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bortoli , Robazza &; Giabardo , 1995 ; Petchlichkoff , 1993 ; Liukkonen et al. , 1996 ) . Furthermore , it would appear that coaches of young players assume a crucial role as significant others , affecting young athletes ' attitudes , self-esteem , and psychosocial development ( Black &; Weiss , 1992 ; Bortoli et al. , 1995 ; Liukkonen et al. , 1996 ) . <p> Although some work has been carried out on American youth soccer coaches ( Miller , 1992 ; Wandzilak , Ansorge &; Potter , 1988 ) , little is currently known about the working behaviors of professional English youth coaches . Additionally , an expansion of the database of behaviors would contribute to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of coaching practice , an approach recently recognized by the Football Association as being necessary for the development of coaching in English soccer ( Football Association , 1991 ) . Furthermore , such data can aid coach education by identifying the instructional behaviors of effective practitioners and this knowledge may assist with the development of possible intervention strategies ( Rupert &; Buschner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study was to contribute to the existing coach behavior database by providing descriptive data pertaining to the coaching behaviors of elite youth soccer coaches . Furthermore , because of reported differences in coach behavior in different settings , a secondary purpose was to compare coaching behavior between two levels of competition . Method <p> Participants <p> The participants for this study were eight English male professional youth soccer coaches . Each worked with either an F.A . Carling Premiership ( N = 5 ) or a Nationwide League ( N = 3 ) youth team ; these leagues being the top two professional soccer divisions in England . The participants ranged in age from 30 to 62 years of age ( M = 41.62 years ; SD = 9.73 years ) and had a minimum of 10 years experience coaching at the professional level ( M = 16.5 years ; SD = 9.71 years ) . None of the coaches had university degrees but all were UEFA ' A ' licensed coaches , and three were accredited coach educators for the governing body the Football Association ( individual coach information is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take part in the study . <p> Instrumentation <p> The instrument used to collect the behavioral data was the Arizona State University Observation Instrument ( A.S.U.O.I. ) ( Lacy &; Darst , 1984 ) . The A.S.U.O.I. has 14 specifically defined behavioral categories ( Table 1 ) , seven of which ( i.e. pre-instruction , concurrent instruction , post-instruction , questioning , physical assistance , positive modeling , negative modeling ) relate directly to the instructional process . The difficulty in observing non-verbal praise and non-verbal scolds during live recording , meant that the non-verbal and verbal categories were combined ( Lacy &; Darst , 1984 ) . <p> Although Lacy and Darst ( 1984 ) assert that with this type of observation instrument inter-observer agreement is more important than questions of validity , the issue of face and content validity need to be considered ( Cheffers , 1977 ) . Cheffers ( 1977 ) , in this regard , described face validity as the ability to demonstrate that the instrument is somewhere on target with its objectives and goals . Lacy and Darst ( 1989 ) have argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.S.U.O.I. because the behavior categories , which comprise it , are specifically defined and distinctly related to coaching behavior . Alternatively , content validity for an instrument is dependent on a rational basis for the selection of actual content of the instrument , together with an adequate sample of all possible content ( Thomas &; Nelson , 1990 ) . Lacy and Darst ( 1989 ) have asserted that because a rational basis exists for the selection of behavior categories which are both representative of coaching behavior , and supported by previous research , the criteria for content validity have been met by the instrument ( Claxton &; Lacy , 1986 ; Lacy &; Darst , 1985 ; Lacy &; Goldston , 1990 ; Miller 1992 ; Potrac et al. , 1997 ; Vangucci et al. , 1997 ) . Additionally , pilot work was done with the instrument to verify the validity of its content categories through preliminary observations of a different sample of youth coaches . As a result of the pilot work , no categories were added , deleted or amended , thus content validity of the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training for the observer . The training was supervized by an experienced observer who had already completed two studies with the instrument ( Potrac et al. , 1997 , Vangucci et al. , 1997 ) . <p> Procedure <p> Each coach was observed three times during typical practice sessions , which took place at the clubs ' respective training grounds . Each observation consisted of three fifteen-minute recording periods interspersed with five minute breaks between each period . Thus , the total amount recorded per training session was 45 minutes , with each coach being observed for 135 minutes in total . A stopwatch was used for timing . <p> A trained observer who stood on or near the practice area to accurately record the participants ' behaviors conducted all observations live . Data were recorded using time sampled event recording ( Rushall , 1977 ) , thus each time an identifiable and pre-defined behavior was observed , including any change in behavior , a record was entered on the A.S.U.O.I. coding form . Any behavior lasting longer than 5 seconds was recorded again , but marked with a dash ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a previous behavior rather than a new one . This allowed the data to be analyzed with regard to specific events ( event recording ) , and time intervals spent in each behavior category ( interval recording ) . In addition , field notes were taken by the observer after each practice session , as a supplement to aid in explaining , and expanding upon , the data ( Seagrave &; Ciancio , 1990 ) . <p> In systematic observation research , the percent of observer agreement is used as an indicator of observer reliability ( van der Mars , 1989 ) . Two types of observer agreement procedure exist , inter-observer agreement ( I.O.A. ) and intra-observer agreement . Inter-observer agreement occurs when one observer 's records are compared with a second who is trained and competent in using the instrument . Intra-observer agreement meanwhile , requires an observer to observe the same events twice at different points in time ( van der Mars , 1989 ) . To complete intra-observer agreement , a record of events is required , as live recording can not be repeated . Although this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session was watched at the beginning and intermittently during data collection to measure intra-observer agreement , and minimize observer drift . Inter-observer agreement was also used to establish the accuracy of coding by checking agreement ( I.O.A. ) prior to and during data collection . Siedentop ( 1983 ) , among others ( Lacy &; Darst , 1989 ; van der Mars , 1989 ) , defines the criterion for I.O.A , as being agreement exceeding 85% , and is determined by dividing the number of agreements by the number of disagreements , then multiplying by 100 . Both the inter- and intra-observer agreement for this study exceeded the determined criterion , the former being 91% , the latter 94% . <p> Data analysis <p> Data were coded and quantified for each behavior category . Percentages and Rate per Minute ( R.P.M. ) for each category were calculated and totaled . The R.P.M. was calculated by dividing the total for each category by the total number of minutes observed . Percentages were calculated by dividing each independent behavior category by the total number of independent behaviors . However , Lacy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of first name category must accompany another behavior . Therefore , the number of uses of first name must be subtracted from the total behaviors , otherwise the percentage of each category would decrease and the true percentage of other behaviors would be distorted . Consequently , the percentage of behaviors accompanying the use of first name was considered separately from the percentage calculated in the other behavior categories . Dividing the number of first names coded by the total number of independent behaviors , which resulted in the percentage of independent behaviors accompanied by a first name did this . <p> For the purpose of comparison , the data were analyzed with regard to the sample as a whole , and then split by league . For analysis of the event recording data , the Mann Whitney U test was used to compare percentages of exhibited behaviors between the two leagues . Because this involved multiple difference tests , effect size ( ES ) is also reported . For interval recording analysis , the percentage of all intervals for each behavior was compared for each category between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes of observation 13,134 discrete behaviors were recorded , which increased to 18,954 when intervals of behavior were included . The frequency , interval , rate per minute ( R.P.M ) , and percentage breakdown for each behavior code for all coaches is shown in Table 2 . <p> The largest single category recorded was concurrent instruction , accounting for 29.7% of frequency and 23.72% of intervals of all behaviors . When instruction is formed into a single category , by combining the components of pre-instruction , concurrent instruction and post-instruction , this then makes it the largest behavior category with 56.61% of frequency and 52.91% of intervals of all behaviors . Furthermore , by combining the seven categories traditionally accepted as related to the instructional process ( i.e. pre-instruction , concurrent instruction , post-instruction , questioning , physical assistance , positive and negative modeling ) ( Lacy &; Darst , 1989 ) , instruction easily becomes the largest overall recorded behavior with 63.68% of frequency and 58.17% of intervals of all behavior . Thus , instruction was given more than any other form of behavior , with the instructional process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The next two largest frequency categories recorded were praise and silence with 14.76% and 10.45% of all recorded behaviors respectively , interestingly , their positions were reversed as intervals of behavior with silence accounting for 13.68% and praise 11.3% of all behaviors . This suggests that while praise occurred more often than silence , it did not last as long . This trend can also be observed in the instruction category , with both pre- and concurrent instruction having greater frequency than interval , while post-instruction had a greater interval than frequency . This suggests that post-instruction , although not given as frequently , when given , lasted longer than pre- and concurrent instruction . <p> The scold to praise ratio for all coaches of 9 to I for both frequency and interval confirms that the coaches observed during this study were spending a greater percentage of their time reinforcing behavior positively . This positive reinforcement can also be noted from the instructional process , with the coaches preferring positive modeling , 3.2% of all behaviors , to negative modeling , 0.21% of all behaviors . <p> Table 3 illustrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches split by league , that is , between the Premier League ( N = 5 ) and the Nationwide League ( N = 3 ) . Significant differences were found between the two leagues in the frequency of the following categories ; use of first name ( p &lt; 0.05 , ES = 98 ) , pre-instruction ( p &lt; 0.05 , ES = 1.43 ) , concurrent instruction ( p &lt; 0.05 , ES = 1.44 ) questioning ( p &lt; 0.01 , ES = 3.05 ) and negative modeling ( p &lt; 0.05 , ES = 2.11 ) . Table 4 summarizes the interval data and consequent percentage of behaviors for the Nationwide and the Premier League coaches . Significant differences here were found between the two leagues in the following categories ; use of first name ( p &lt; 0.05 , ES = 1.02 ) , pre-instruction ( p = 0.05 , ES = 1.41 ) , concurrent instruction ( p &lt; 0.05 , ES = 1.06 ) , questioning ( p &lt; 0.05 , ES = 2.94 ) and negative modeling ( p &lt; 0.05 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winer ( 1991 ) propose that ES values of .2 represents small differences , .5 moderate differences , .8+ large differences . All the values in this study are in excess of .8 . <p> Despite the differences highlighted between the subdivided behavior categories , the coaches ' dominant behaviors remained relatively consistent when the sample was split by league . The instructional process ( i.e. the seven combined categories ) thus , remained the principal behavior accounting for 57.39% of all Premier League and 59.57% of all Nationwide League behaviors respectively when recorded by interval data . Interestingly however , all the differences in behavior between the coaches as split by league occurred within the instructional process despite their gross percentages being similar , indicating instruction being delivered differently between the two leagues . <p> Praise remained the second largest frequency of behavior for both leagues , 14.37% and 15.59% of all behaviors respectively . The third most frequently demonstrated behavior was silence , accounting for 10.6% of all behaviors of Premier League coaches , and 10.29% of all behaviors of Nationwide League coaches . The Premier League coaches follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect with their interval scores for praise and silence being reversed , with silence becoming the second largest category of behavior demonstrated ( 14.17% of all behaviors ) and praise becoming the third ( 10.31% of all behaviors ) . The Nationwide coaches however , do not follow such a pattern , with praise remaining the second largest interval of all behaviors ( 13.09% ) and silence the third ( 12.8% of all behaviors ) . Additionally , it was noted that while the Premier and Nationwide League coaches have similar frequencies of silence , the Premier League coaches have more intervals of silence . Finally , the scold to praise ratio for both leagues was 9 to I as was the ratio for the combined data . Discussion <p> Use of Instruction <p> In line with previous observational research in soccer and other sports , instruction and its related behaviors were the most frequently used . Whilst it is argued that instruction is an essential element in coach effectiveness ( Lacy &; Darst , 1985 ; Tinning , 1982 ; Jones , 1997 ) , in this context effectiveness stems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would necessitate a judicious use of instructional behavior , rather than a rigid application of ' generic ' teaching skills . A qualitative analysis , however is beyond the methodological means of this study , although it is an important part of future research . <p> Whilst previous studies in youth sport ( Lacy , 1989 ; Miller , 1992 ; Wandzilak et al. , 1988 ) found instruction to be the largest category , the amount in this study was greater than had been previously found . More in line with results in top level head soccer coaches ( Potrac et al. , 1997 ) . Differences ( and similarities ) in instructional behavior have been attributed to the coaching context ( Miller , 1992 ) . Arguably , the elite nature of the coaching context in this study produced similar results to Potrac et al . ( 1997 ) . <p> This high level of instruction within the professional environment could result from task dependency ( Terry , 1984 ) , which proposes that top-level performers in interdependent sports prefer high levels of instruction and direction . Bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting that top-level basketball coaches ' instructiveness ' positively related to players ' attitude toward their coaches . Thus , a favorable coaching climate results from coaches adapting their coaching behavior to meet player preferences . Similarly Cross ( 1995 ) concluded that some elite athletes wanted coaches to make decisions for them . This is described by Lyle ( 1999 ) as the principle of consensual authority , where an accommodation is reached between coach and player , with the latter accepting high levels of technical instruction and direct intervention " because of the coach 's empathetic and supportive approach " ( Lyle , 1999 , p.42 ) . <p> A further possible reason for the high levels of instruction relates to power and its function within the coach-player relationship . Borrie ( 1996 ) highlights the difference in coach-player relationships between a professional and amateur context . This he argues is reflected in the power and control the professional coach has over many facets of the players ' environment . Essentially , the professional coaches success is determined by team performance , thus , high levels of instruction becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high levels of coach control . <p> Although this reasoning could hold true in the professional youth context , high levels of instruction could be explained by the developmental objectives of coaching at this level . The practices observed in this study were predominantly ' technical ' in nature with instructional feedback , an important variable to learning motor skills ( Schmidt , 1988 ) , used most frequently . Indeed , large parts of practice time were spent developing individual technique . The professional youth coaches ' success relates not only to win/loss but also the technical ability of the players , and the player 's progression to the senior ranks . This developmental role is emphasized by Cart and Prosser ( 1997 ) who state " the main priority as a youth team coach is to produce a steady supply for the first team " ( p. 12 ) . Youth sport , therefore , is a steppingstone for future success ( Dubois , 1981 ; van Lingen , 1997 ) . Therefore , professional youth coaches are concerned with developing players personal excellence , more than win/loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality and direction of the learning environment as well as team performance ( DeMarco et al. , 1996 ) . Therefore , high levels of instruction , as a key criteria for effectiveness , would seem of paramount importance . <p> The results support Vangucci et al 's ( 1997 ) notion of differences in soccer coaches behavior between different leagues . The Nationwide and Premier League coaches were not significantly different in their overall instructional behavior . However , when instruction is broken into pre- , concurrent and post instruction , there were differences between the leagues for pre- and concurrent instruction , but interestingly no significant difference in post instruction . Post instruction was used by both sets of coaches , and its percentage increases from frequency to interval , while pre- and concurrent instruction falls . So whilst there was less post instruction , what there was tended to last longer . This therefore , supports the contention that successful coaches give instruction when the performer is free from the immediate attentional demands of performance ( Marland &; Martinek , 1988 ) . <p> Coaches from both leagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in research in English soccer ( Potrac et al. , 1997 ; Vangucci et al. , 1997 ) . The Premier League coaches utilized more concurrent and less pre-instruction than their Nationwide League counterparts . One possible reason for this could be the type of practice used . The Premier League coaches used practices that did not require large amounts of explanation . Lacy and Darst ( 1985 ) noted differences in behavior in different segments of practice , with segments allotted to ' group ' work , separating players to work on skills , and ' team ' segments working with tactical units up to and including the whole team . Whilst all the coaches used technical practices , the Premier League coaches used more ' team ' type practices . Difference in practice notwithstanding , differences in instructional behavior could be also a result of behavior being appropriate to specific players hence , " effective coaching behavior could be situation specific " ( Jones , 1997 , p.28 ) . <p> Vangucci et al ( 1997 ) found league position to be inversely proportional to the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected a vagueness in feedback and a lack of expertise . The results in this study did not support this proposition with higher level coaches using more concurrent instruction . However , the type of concurrent instruction perhaps explains this disparity , it was noted that the coaches in this instance restricted their concurrent instruction to short informative phrases , thus , not overloading performers with information while they attended to performance . The feedback contained informational content directing players ' attention to specific aspects of performance . These findings echo other studies that reported high levels of specific instruction ( Sherman &; Hassan , 1986 ; Wandzilak et al. , 1988 ) . <p> These results link to the key premise that effective coaching relates to the quality of instruction rather than quantity alone ( DeMarco et al. , 1996 ) . So whilst ' effective ' coaches spend more time instructing than the ' less effective ' , the information given is directly related to task performance . In this case , the amount of instruction was considerable but also highly task specific . <p> Use of Praise <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scold to praise ratio was approximately 1:9 , higher than in earlier studies ( Lacy &; Darst , 1985 ; Miller , 1992 ; Vangucci et al. , 1997 ) , but less than previously found in professional English soccer ( Potrac et al. , 1997 ) . Anomalies such as these suggest differential feedback strategies , perhaps related to the age and ability of the players , in this instance , the results perhaps suggest that youth coaches tried to cultivate a positive environment for their players . A positive environment could foster enthusiasm and favorable attitudes , affecting also players perceptions of themselves and their abilities ( Horn , 1992 ; Smith et al. , 1983 ; van der Mars &; Darst , 1988 ) . However , Tharpe and Gallimore ( 1976 ) assert that high-level performers become highly motivated toward specific goals , and praise becomes unnecessary . Thus a question arises , not regarding the motives of the coaches to provide a supportive environment , but to the efficacy of such a strategy , if the feedback was habitual , non-specific and consequently meaningless for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This study agrees with the considerable previous literature that demonstrates praise to be a substantial behavior utilized by coaches ( Black &; Weiss , 1992 ; Cratty , 1973 ; Horn , 1992 ; Lacy &; Darst , 1985 , Potrac et al. , 1997 ) . However , research has shown that less successful coaches used more praise than the successful ( Claxton , 1988 ; Model , 1983 ) . Thus while praise can be considered an effective tool for the coach , its overuse can be interpreted as nonspecific feedback , which dilutes its effects ( Schmidt , 1991 ) . As with instruction , the efficacy of praise is a function of its appropriateness and specificity ( Carreira Da Costa &; Peiron , 1992 ) . <p> An interesting observation here , related to the development of positive and relaxed working environment was the use of humor . Indeed , humor has been suggested as a vital tool for promoting enjoyment and developing good relations with the players ( Borrie , 1996 ; Seagrave &; Ciancio , 1990 ) . In this study humor was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of first name ' , was used in conjunction with another behavior . Its use by the coaches could have been aimed at developing cohesion and integration with the players as well as establishing an appropriate working atmosphere . Clearly , the use of humor warrants further investigation , as an adjunct to future observation instruments , and to understanding its role in the coaching process and effective coaching . <p> Use of Silence <p> Silence was the third largest behavior category in both frequency and interval . For all the coaches the percentage of silence increased from frequency to interval , indicating that they spent periods of time saying nothing , observing the practice . Here , the players were active , but nothing was said . Both Claxton ( 1988 ) and Lacy ( 1988 ) found silence to be a frequently used behavior but attributed it to coaches being off task . However , coaches do not need to be involved in ' active ' coaching behaviors constantly during practice , indeed , players need , at times , " to play and not feel the tension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , indeed , such a strategy can still facilitate learning with players involved in ' discovery learning ' ( Davids , 1998 ) . The coach 's role then is not direct intervention but to organise practices that guide the players toward a stated objective ( Connell , 1997 ; Davids , 1998 ) . <p> Rupert and Buschner ( 1989 ) propose the notion of silently monitoring as a coaching strategy , where the coach observes and reflects on appropriate intervention . Such detailed observation is a crucial coaching behavior , with observation and insightful analysis being vital for coaching success ( van Lingen , 1997 ) . The coaches in this study tended to get a practice underway , then remain silent allowing a period of free play before intervening . Following intervention , the coaches again were silent , observing the practice . A pattern of coaching emerged , with silence interspersed with judicious comments and feedback . Consequently , silence appeared to play an essential role in the delivery of information , perhaps ensuring not only careful and measured feedback , but also that the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing players to engage in their own sensory feedback ( Magill , 1993 ) . <p> Use of Other Behaviors <p> The coaches in this study did not use questioning to any great extent ( 3.1% of all recorded behaviors ) . However , there was a difference between the leagues in its use . Questioning has been proposed as a valid teaching strategy ( Claxton , 1988 ) , but coach behavior will largely depend on the needs of the performer and the context ( Lashuk , 1992 ) . The difference in this case could be a function of the coaching context , where coaches are required to respond to the dynamic environment that faces them . <p> An interesting finding was the difference between the leagues in the use of first name . The type of practice was instrumental in this respect . The ' group ' practices , typically employed by Nationwide League coaches often contained generic mistakes , affecting all players , resulting in coaching to the group . The ' team ' practices employed to a greater extent by the Premiership coaches , involved specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater use of first names . In all instances however , the players ' practice intensity was positively influenced by direct interaction with the coach . Conclusion <p> This study , through the use of description , endeavored to compare and contrast elite youth soccer coaches from two professional leagues . Although it remains possible to draw preliminary conclusions from the coaches observed , particularly in relation to the predominance of instructionally related behaviors used , the positiveness and measured specificity or ' the feedback given , and the willingness to observe practices closely at length before intervening , a cautionary note should also be sounded regarding these practices . The results undoubtedly highlighted the contextual nature of the coaching process , which inevitable make meaningful comparison difficult as the differences observed have been identified without controlling for possible confounding variables , such as , coaching experience , coaching philosophy , nature of the group being coached , and playing experience , it is thus recommended that future research , in addition to further solidifying the empirical database of coach behaviors , needs to investigate qualitatively the philosophies , beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore developing a deeper understanding of good coaching practices . <p> Address Correspondence To : Christopher J.
