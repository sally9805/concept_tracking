<p> Dave Siefert is clear on one concept : An ocean kayaker should never , no matter what , let go of the paddle when out on a trek with Sonoma County 's Banzai Bozos ocean kayaking club . <p> Not even if he is being pounded by huge waves against the walls inside a rocky coastal cavern , as Siefert has been . <p> Not if he happens to be attempting to drag a friend 's water-filled kayak to safety past the breakers . Or if he 's being bashed against rocks so hard that ribs break  --  as has happened . <p> And especially not if a wave has tossed him out of his kayak and into the rough seas . <p> The paddle , Siefert says , is a lifeline . <p> " You do n't let go of it because you will need it if you eventually get your kayak back , " Siefert says . And that is when the real adventure begins . <p> The rugged Sonoma and Mendocino coastlines are the usual playground for this group , which takes the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen or so Banzai Bozo members , who have been gathering informally for about 18 years , are famous for launching themselves from huge rocks along the coastline in the same area near Jenner that is a common feeding ground for great white sharks . So far , no members have become a meal . <p> They have , however , been clobbered by 20-foot waves , trapped inside water-filled caves and shot through rock formation tunnels . Plus , they 've had close encounters with passing whales . All the while , the Banzai Bozos play it off as if they were just a bunch of big kids out having fun . <p> " Any time I feel like I am becoming an appetizer for a shark , then I know it is time to get out of the water , " said John Nagle , co-founder . <p> Nagle , along with his brother Dave , started the kayaking group in 1982 after a summer camping trip during a heat wave . <p> " My brother said he wished we could go camping on the water . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared with a new kayak and urged him to come along and experience the ocean . <p> " You should have seen us , " Nagle said . " There we were trying to surf tiny two-foot breaker waves in our kayaks and feeling very nervous about it . " <p> The brothers quickly became more experienced and started inviting friends along . Soon it was a small group gaining more experience with each trip . They heard about another kayaking group out of Half Moon Bay , the Tsunami Rangers , who were known for wild and crazy exploits , and for putting on kayak races in their area . <p> " We started competing in the races whenever we could , " Nagle said . " Then one of our guys got a flyer offering membership in the Tsunami Rangers . It had all kinds of criteria and difficult qualifications . " <p> Nagle and company decided it would be easier and more fun to start their own group . One of the members dubbed them the Banzai Bozos , a name that stuck . <p> " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nagle said . <p> Since then , various death-defying trips on the water have sparked a passion for seeing parts of the Pacific Coast that most people do n't get to see . <p> On a recent nine-mile ocean trek down the coast from Navarro in Mendocino County to the town of Elk , the kayakers were treated to the sight of sea lions sunbathing on rocks . <p> " There is a distinction between sea kayaking and ocean kayaking , " explained Siefert . " Regular sea kayakers sit in a more traditional enclosed Eskimo boat with a skirt around it . Ocean kayakers sit on top , strapped in by the legs and with a backboard in a type of boat that is much better for rough water . <p> " One of our favorite things to do is to work with the breaker waves to put us on top of wash rocks . Once we are up there , we wait for the next big wave to come in from behind and to shoot us off , " explained Siefert . <p> " One of our members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spotted in the waters off Bodega , " said Marty Isom , another Bozo veteran . " All of a sudden the whale came up underneath and hit him with her tail , dumping him out of the kayak and into the ocean . " <p> The member was OK after the ordeal . Isom calls it " a story we would all like to be able to tell . " <p> Not that Isom or Siefert need any help telling stories . The two friends , both in their early 40s , have been Banzai Bozos for five years and have plenty of their own tales . <p> But they say the club is not all about death-defying adventures and that it is not a requirement of membership to put oneself into precarious situations . Some of those precarious situations have , however , attracted the interest of a national kayak manufacturing company , said Nagle . <p> " We started sending them photos of some of their kayaks we had that were damaged or in pieces , " Nagle said . " They started sending us prototypes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> When he is not on the water experiencing new adventures , Siefert said he is most happy doing volunteer work with at-risk teenagers in the North Bay . One of the things he likes to introduce the kids to is  --  you guessed it  --  ocean kayaking . <p> " You really learn to push yourself and how to control panic and fear , " Siefert said . And it 's great for the kids . Even with the toughest kid , you can really start to see the layers washing away . " <p> But do kids want to get their feet wet ? Not necessarily . <p> " I am working with one kid who is really hard-edged . I told him that I wanted to take him out kayaking . He gave me funny look and said that kayaks are for geeks , " Siefert said . <p> Isom disagrees . <p> At his home in the town of Windsor , Isom produces a nine-foot-long yellow kayak whose black repair marks and dents offer proof of extreme battering . Isom and Siefert launch into a tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near a rock they refer to as " Pirates of the Caribbean . " <p> They found a cove that neither had ever kayaked through , they said . The ocean was treacherous , with huge swells , but there seemed to be a five-minute break between each set of waves . <p> " We knew from the beginning that we should n't be going in there , " Isom said . " The rest of the group stayed on the outside . " They intended to explore for a little bit and then paddle out before the swells got too big again . <p> Isom said that he and Siefert could see the next set of breakers coming at them , so they began paddling back out past the waves . But there was one small problem : Their timing was off . <p> While Isom was able to make it over the top of the first huge wave , it broke on Siefert , who was immediately swamped by it and knocked out of his kayak . <p> The next thing Siefert remembers seeing was Isom speeding past him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big wave . <p> " There have been two or three times in our lives when we thought we might die , " Siefert said . " This was one of them . We were in the hammer zone . As the waves kept pounding me , I kept thinking that if I could only avoid hitting a rock then I would be OK . " <p> The other members of the Bozos were concerned enough that they went ashore , climbed the bluffs and made arrangements for the sheriff 's rescue team to assist . The two men finally emerged relatively unscathed , Isom riding a kayak to shore like a horse after several uncertain minutes in the drink . Somehow , the two wound up with each other 's kayak . <p> Isom says he looks forward to such adventures with his fellow Bozos . <p> " We 've been hammered so hard and so many times it 's amazing , " Isom said . " It 's like being a pinball . And if your timing is off by as little as 10 feet , you may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To reach the Banzai Bozos , send an e-mail to Marty Isom at mjkisom@dellnet.com . <p> Alex Horvath is a free-lance writer based in Santa Rosa .
