Imagine writing a letter of life-and-death importance and trying to mail it only to discover that you have the wrong address , the wrong envelope and no way to buy a stamp . Robert Langer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been wrestling with a problem very much like that for 25 years . In his case the letters are life-saving drugs , and the goal is to deliver them to the right place at the right dose and at the right time . <P> Langer 's career as pharmaceutical postman began in 1974 when he graduated from M.I.T. with a doctorate in chemical engineering . He had 20 job offers from oil companies but opted instead for a postdoctorate position at Children 's Hospital in Boston with Judah Folkman , one of the world 's leading cancer researchers . It may have seemed an odd choice for an engineer with a bankable resume , but it gave Langer a unique perspective on a fast-growing field . He has since become the leading pioneer of modern biomedical engineering , earning scores of awards and distinctions and nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to find a way to release gradually a stream of large organic molecules into the tissue of a laboratory animal . Researchers had already tried encasing large molecules like the one Langer was testing in polymers ( long-chain molecules , such as silicone , that are semipermeable to certain types of molecules ) . Unfortunately , this particular molecule  --  like most of the new drugs being created in biotech labs  --  was much too large to fit through the tiny holes in any of the available polymers . The problem , polymer experts told Langer , was unsolvable . <P> But he solved the problem simply by turning it upside down . Rather than try to sift marbles through a screen too fine to let them through , Langer in effect wrapped the screen around the marbles , creating a three-dimensional matrix honeycombed with marble-size chutes and ladders that would allow his molecules to slowly work their way out . It was a breakthrough that ushered in a new generation of drug-delivery systems . <P> Langer also changed forever the way the materials used in these systems are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for medical applications . ( The fabric in the first artificial heart , for example , was the same polyether urethane used in women 's girdles . ) Langer reversed the search process ; in his lab , researchers first determine the exact physiological requirements of a system and then design a polymer to meet those specs . <P> In 1986 , for example , Langer and neurosurgeon Henry Brem devised the first dime-size chemotherapy wafers to treat brain cancer . These wafers release powerful cancer-fighting drugs slowly in the site where a tumor has been removed in order to kill any cancer cells the surgeon has missed . By confining the drugs to the site of the tumor , the effects on other organs are minimized  --  always a major consideration in chemotherapy . The same concept has since been applied to prostate , spinal and ovarian cancers .
