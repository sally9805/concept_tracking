<p> How can you improve on perfection ? <p> After three games this season , Heritage Hills is not only unbeaten but is also unscored-upon . Not only that , led by senior running back Cole Seifrig , the Patriots are averaging almost 61 points a game themselves . <p> " We 've got good team speed . We 're mixing the pass and the run pretty well , " Heritage Hills coach Bob Clayton said Wednesday . " Our quarterback is starting to settle down and see things better . Defensively , we 're just hustling and trying to get to the ball . " <p> Heritage Hills , which was ranked No. 1 before a semistate tourney loss to eventual Class 3A champion Indianapolis Chatard last year , plays at No. 1 and defending 4A champion Jasper on Friday night . The Patriots currently are ranked No. 2 behind Chatard , which plays at Indianapolis Manual . <p> Jasper has the state 's longest overall winning streak at 13 games since a 14-7 loss to Heritage Hills last year . Heritage Hills has the state 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtime loss to Southridge in 1998 . <p> Seifrig , an honorable-mention All-State pick last year , is averaging 107.3 yards rushing per game and is third in the state in scoring with 62 points . On defense , he is among the state 's leaders with three interceptions . <p> " They have an extremely quick football team . With the Seifrig boy giving them an added dimension of quickness , no one 's been able to slow them down yet , " Jasper coach Jerry Brewer said . <p> The Wildcats are coming off a 35-7 victory over winless Boonville , the same team that lost 49-0 to Heritage Hills two weeks earlier . Heritage Hills then pounded Tell City 55-0 and Pike Central 78-0 . <p> Jasper ca n't dwell on the Patriots ' dominating performance so far , Brewer said . <p> " We just play our ball game and not worry about what they 've been able to do . " <p> The key , he said , is to prevent big plays and long touchdowns . <p> " We have to sustain that quickness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let them have it all the time , " said Brewer , who has won a state-record 360 games . <p> The Wildcats graduated All-State running back Brian Lewis , who rushed for just under 2,000 yards and 34 touchdowns . But their returning players included quarterback Ben Schmidt and his twin brother , Chris , who had more than 900 yards in receptions and was second to Lewis with 17 touchdowns . <p> " They 've got a little more speed than in the past , " Clayton said . " They 've got some great kids that came back from their state championship team . It 's a little less vanilla than it used to be . They were always a power running team , and they 're throwing the ball more , mixing up their formation more . So they present more of a problem in preparation . " <p> They 'll also give Heritage Hills a lot tougher game than the Patriots have had so far . <p> " It 's not a conference game , it 's not a sectional situation ... But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's our best measuring stick in our regular-season games . " <p> HOME ADVANTAGE ? @ Jasper has Heritage Hills right where it wants it going into Friday night 's big game - at home . <p> " You always like to play in your own back yard . Mom can take of you a little better there , " Jasper 's Jerry Brewer said . " She can get to you quicker than if you 're over the fence in somebody else 's yard . " <p> Three of the other four No. 1-ranked teams also are at home on Friday night . <p> Penn , the top-ranked team in Class 5A , takes on South Bend Riley ; 2A 's No. 1 Speedway is home against Indianapolis Ritter ; and Class A 's No. 1 Southern Wells faces Leo . <p> No. 1 and defending 3A champion Indianapolis Chatard , which does n't have its own home field , plays at Indianapolis Manual . <p> Besides Jasper-Heritage Hills , other big games on Friday include 3A No. 3 Andrean at 4A No. 10 Munster , and 3A No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luers . <p> In games with other ranked 5A teams , No. 2 Warren Central is at Terre Haute North , No. 3 Fort Wayne Snider is at Fort Wayne Elmhurst , No. 4 Castle is at Evansville Central , No. 5 Center Grove is home against Lawrence North , sixth-ranked Valparaiso is at Michigan City , No. 7 Ben Davis is at Terre Haute South , No. 8 Homestead visits Columbia City , ninth-rated Evansville Reitz is host to Evansville Harrison , and No. 10 Columbus North is at Martinsville . <p> EAGLES REVIVED : @ The Lake Station team bus rolled into the school parking lot amid as big a celebration as it would have received with a state championship . <p> The 24-6 victory at Calumet was only one game , of course , but it meant a whole lot more for a school that at this time last year did not even have a team . <p> " That was as happy as I 've ever seen any kids , " said Joe Fussell , the new coach at the Lake County school . " They sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievable . They proved to themselves they could achieve something . " <p> Lake Station was winless in 2000 . Last year , Principal Dale Osburn decided to drop football last year because so few boys wanted to play , but a huge community backlash prompted the school board to reinstate the sport midway through the season . <p> The Eagles lost all five games they played last year and the first two this season before Friday 's victory snapped a 19-game losing streak going back to 1999 . <p> " It was so beautiful to watch that on the bus ride home . And then when we got here , the community ... I 've never seen that ... , " said Fussell , who spent the past 17 years at Triton Central . " The whole town must have been out there in the parking lot , cheering as we came in . It could n't be any better than that for a state championship . " <p> Fussell wo n't take credit for any of it , though . <p> " A lot of things were in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , who was a tiger . He went to work . When I first came here , he had the boys here in the morning lifting . Then the community stepped up ... the administration , the school , the parents , a vibrant booster club that went to work , they were bound and determined to make this thing work . " <p> The team now has 36 players , including 25 freshmen and sophomores and just six seniors . <p> " They must have been doing some things right before I got here , " Fussell said . " The junior high program was solid ... and we got a large contingent of sophomores that must have had a good experience even in spite of what happened last year . " <p> GAMES AS SCHEDULED : @ School officials in Allen County , which has had more reports of West Nile virus infections than any other county in the state , have decided to go ahead with the regular schedule of evening football games . <p> A Fort Wayne woman died last week in Indiana 's first suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes or animals in all sections of the state . State health officials said Monday that another 28 probable human cases of West Nile infection have been reported in Indiana , 10 of them in Allen County . <p> The schools earlier this week considered moving the games to daylight hours , when mosquitoes are less active . <p> " We would certainly move games if possible , but it is not possible , " Fort Wayne school superintendent Thomas Fowler-Finn said Wednesday . " People 's lives are so intricately interwoven with band competition , student employment , all sorts of things . It 's just not possible . " <p> Instead , fans are being urged to wear long sleeves and pants and use a DEET-based insect repellant . <p> " We 're just to take precautions , " Fort Wayne Snider athletic director Mike Hawley said . " They 're spraying the fields , we 're providing repellant for our kids , bands , cheerleaders and so on .

The state 's passing leader is Mike Vlahogeorge of Lafayette Jeff , who had a school-record 508 yards and five TDs in a 35-14 victory over Logansport . " The record is something I do n't think about until after a game . I 'm concerned about the score . Yards are nice , but I do n't play football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the junior QB , who has passed for 1,195 yards in three games . ... Unranked Portage and 2A No. 7 North Judson have not given up a point in three games . " All I know is , if nobody scores on us , we ca n't lose , " Portage coach Craig Buzea said . ...
