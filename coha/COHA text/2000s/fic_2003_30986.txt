" Look out , girl , here come the Tolliver twins ! Have mercy ! They look like they 're ready to bite something . " Delia pulled her books close to her body and tried to avoid what looked like was going to be a direct confrontation with the two most feared boys at the school  --  Tabu and Titan Tolliver . " Or kill something , " Charlene whispered , eyes wide with real concern . " I would n't want to be alone in a room with them . Every time they pass me , I get so scared , I feel like I 'm gon na wet my pants ! " " That 's disgusting ! " Delia said , laughing , as she glanced at Charlene . " I ai n't lyin ' ! I 'm scared for real ! I heard they kill puppies and kittens for fun . Felicity Johnson lives next door to them , and she told me she found her kitten dead on her front steps . It had been stabbed with a knife , " Charlene said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , too . But that 's no proof that the twins killed her kitten , " Delia said , trying to sound reasonable . " Sometimes kids just make that stuff up ' cause it sounds gross . " " Greg Mason 's dog was also killed . Stabbed . And he lives down the street from the Tollivers , " Charlene added with authority . " His next-door neighbor 's cousin told me . " " I heard Greg 's dog got hit by a car , " Delia replied . But she still watched nervously as the two unsmiling boys approached them . It was as if a double shadow was heading their way . " The dog is still dead , " Charlene said , refusing to accept any other explanation . " And Greg 's house is awfully close to the Tollivers ' . Yo Yo told me the twins carry knives and sawed-off shotguns and hand grenades in their book bag . " Charlene spoke as if she believed it . " You believe that ? " Charlene asked , hoping Delia would say no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but those two are some scary dudes . I would n't be surprised at anything . Before you know it , we 'll be needing metal detectors on the front doors around here . " " I 'm surprised they have n't got around to that  --  makin ' this place feel like a prison . Most of the big-city schools have all kinds of security these days , " Charlene stated with authority . " Yeah , I know . Small-town schools , too . It 's a shame . Why do you think the Tollivers dress in the same black clothes every day ? " Delia asked in a whisper . " You think that 's all the clothes they have ? " " Maybe they want to show people how bad they are ! " Charlene said softly . " They made me a believer ! " " You got that right ! Quit whispering ! They know we 're talkin ' about them ! " Delia and Charlene tried to move out of the way of the twins , but the halls were crowded , and everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titan and Tabu  --  tall and impressive-looking , dressed exactly alike in black jeans , black sweaters , and black skullcaps  --  strode through the hall not as two people but as one unified force . Their faces wore the same menacing frown , their fists were clenched into the same tight threat , and their thick black boots stomped in unison on the scuffed hallway floor . They carried no books , even though it was almost third bell . They glared at Charlene and Delia as they pushed through the crowded hallway . With his shoulder , Titan pushed Delia against the lockers , and Tabu knocked Charlene out of the way in the other direction as they passed . She lost her balance and fell to the floor in a heap of books and papers . Tabu and Titan glanced back at them as though to make sure their authority had terrified the two girls . It had . Delia said nothing and looked the other way rather than risk a confrontation . A sea of people in the hall separated as the two forged a path through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're Moses in the wilderness , " Charlene said with disgust as she picked up her books and papers . " Looks like the parting of the waters of the Red Sea as they go through there . " " No , not Moses , " Delia said , rubbing her shoulder . " Moses was a holy man . Those two are ... bad . I can feel it . " " They give me chills . They do n't talk to people , they do n't speak up in class  --  I think some of the teachers are scared of them too , " Charlene declared as they headed on to their classes . Delia sighed . " Miss Benson , my English teacher , is real scared of them , I know . She 's just a first-year teacher  --  she does n't know how to handle the rough kids yet . It 's all she can do to figure out how to handle the thirty-one other kids in the class , let alone the Terrible Tollivers . There 's the bell . That 's where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace out , Delia . Stay clear of those two . " " You do n't have to warn me . Besides , I got enough problems of my own to take time to worry about them . Later . " Delia hurried down the hall and into her classroom just before Miss Benson closed the door . She was glad her seat was in the front of the room , far away from Tabu and Titan , who sat in the very last row in the back . Miss Benson had not tried to change their seats when they transferred into the class during the second week of school . Delia figured the teacher wanted to keep as much space as possible between her and those two openly hostile boys . Miss Benson was very young  --  just out of college . She still had hints of teenage acne on her face and she dressed more like a teenager than a teacher . Delia had thought she looked really uncomfortable in the business suit that she had worn for Open House  --  she was probably a jeans-and-sweatshirt kind of person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she giggled sometimes when she should have put on a stony face . But Delia liked her because Miss Benson was energetic and excited about teaching , not like many of her other teachers , who seemed so tired every day . Delia also liked her because she could fool Miss Benson so easily . Miss Benson still had much to learn . Delia forgot about Tabu and Titan for the moment as class began . Miss Benson tried to be pleasant and conversational as she took attendance . " Quentin Bates ? Glad to see you back . That flu bug is a doozy ! Make sure you see me after class for makeup work . " Quentin coughed and nodded . " Delia Douglas ? " Delia answered with a smile . " Here . " " Smiling and prepared , as usual , I see . " Miss Benson liked her , Delia could tell . Delia knew most of her teachers liked her because she was always pleasant and cooperative , willing to run errands or pass out materials . " Are you jumping on the Double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah  --  it 's the bomb ! " Yolanda blurted out before Delia had a chance to answer . " Me and Delia and Charlene Byrd are the best jumpers on the face of the earth ! You ought a come see us jump tomorrow ! It 's just the city qualifying competition , but I 'll still be dynamite ! Or you can come to the state finals in a few weeks if you feel like driving to Columbus . " Delia turned around and grinned at Yolanda , who always enjoyed being the center of attention . She also noticed that the Tolliver brothers had glanced at each other as Yolanda spoke . Delia 's smile faded into a frown . Miss Benson replied , " I 'm very proud of all of you , but I ca n't come tomorrow . However , I promise I will come to see you jump one of these days . " " Okay , then plan to come to the national finals  --  well , we call it the World Championships because kids from places like Taiwan and Canada and Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held here in Cincinnati in a couple of months . And I WILL be the star ! " she boasted with a grin . " I 'll let you know the dates and stuff . " Miss Benson promised again to try to make it . The rest of the class started to talk about the Double Dutch team , the baseball team , the choir  --  the conversation expanding as each person added something about their own particular after-school activity . " Let 's settle down now , " Miss Benson said mildly . She continued through the rest of the names on the list , even though she could see at a glance who was absent . It was her way of making the class feel comfortable . Delia liked the fact that Miss Benson took the time to talk to the kids , even if it was just stupid small talk before each class . " Leeza Moxley ? Nice hairstyle this morning . " Leeza smiled and stood for everyone to notice her curls and waves . Most of the kids ignored her , but Leeza did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show off . " Miss Yolanda Pepper , " Miss Benson said with a little bow , as if Yo Yo were some kind of princess . Yolanda loved it , of course . " What a lovely necklace , " Miss Benson began . " I got it in Mexico when me and my parents went this weekend , " Yolanda said immediately . " It 's real silver . " " My parents and I , " Miss Benson said automatically . Then she asked , " You went to Mexico just for the weekend ? " Delia laughed to herself . She could n't believe that Miss Benson could keep falling for Yolanda 's tall tales . Yolanda , who liked to be called Yo Yo , specialized in not telling the truth . " Hey , Miss Benson , you ought to know you ca n't believe Yo Yo . She lies like a rug ! She ai n't never been to Mexico . And she got that necklace at the dollar store ! " Randy shouted loudly across the room . " Now you just telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Randy grinned and yelled back , " No , but I saw your mama there . She 's so backwards , she was askin ' for a price check at the dollar store ! " " Do n't you be talkin ' about my mama , Randy ! I was in Mexico and I can prove it , " Yolanda insisted . " I 'll show you my plane ticket stub ! " Yolanda furiously dug in her purse , searching for the paper that would prove her story . " I ca n't find it , but I 'll bring it tomorrow . You can call my mother and ask her ! " " Your mama probably do n't even know where Mexico is ! " Randy teased . " Your mama is so dumb , she could n't pass a blood test ! " Everyone in the class laughed , except for the Tollivers . Yo Yo put her hands on her hips and fired a look of challenge at Randy . " I told you do n't be talkin ' about my mother ! Your mama 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch ! " Randy quipped back quickly , " Well , your mama 's so clumsy she got tangled up in the cordless phone ! " " Well , I heard your mama took a spoon to the Super Bowl ! " " That 's enough from both of you ! " Miss Benson said sternly . " I will NOT have this kind of disrespect in my classroom ! " She was quickly losing control of the class . Delia watched with mild amusement . As she sat down , Yolanda muttered loud enough for Randy to hear , " At least I got a mama ! " Randy 's smile faded . He tried to hide it , but Delia could see the hurt look on his face . Miss Benson went back to taking attendance . " Tabu Tolliver ? " The room was silent . " I see you 're here . Good , " Miss Benson said . " Titan Tolliver ? Also present , " Miss Benson said , almost to herself . She looked a little nervous , Delia thought . " Randy Youngblood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yo ! " Randy shouted loudly . " The Youngblood is here ! And I 'm sorry for all that stuff I said , Miss Benson . Yolanda 's mama is cool with me . " He was trying to regain a little power , Delia realized . Yolanda had been way out of line . Randy 's mother had left her husband and her son a couple of years ago . Randy had not heard from her since , and even though he tried to cover it up with jokes , Delia knew it still was a painful subject for him . " Sit down , Randy . Nobody could miss you . And your apology should go to Yolanda . " Randy glanced at Yolanda , but she had taken a brush from her book bag and was noticeably fixing her hair while ignoring Randy completely . " That 's everyone . Let 's get started . " Miss Benson began by passing out several typed pages that had come from the school office . " Put the brush away , Yolanda . Your hair looks fine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told , Miss Benson continued : " As you know , class , the state proficiency test is coming up soon . It 's extremely important for you as eighth graders because it will determine if you go on to ninth grade . We 've been practicing and preparing all year for this , and I know you 're ready  --  I 'm confident you 'll all do fine . Take these information forms home to your parents and bring them back signed on Monday . The test is next month . Are there any questions ? Yes , Randy ? " " What if I fail ? " " You 're not going to fail . You 're the biggest , smartest thing in here ! " Miss Benson said , laughing . " I think so too . And the best-looking , too ! I just wanted to hear you say it ! " " Sit down , Randy . " Delia loved the way Randy always made class fun . He joked around and teased all the teachers . But he always made good grades  --  straight A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yolanda ? " Miss Benson sighed . Delia could tell this was not what the teacher had planned for today 's class . But Delia did n't care ; anything that stalled real academic work was fine with her . " I ca n't take the test , " Yolanda began as she stuffed the brush into her book bag and took out a small mirror to check the results . " Why not ? " " I read an article that said excessive testing causes blood clots in the brain . I ca n't afford to risk my health for a stupid test . I am a champion Double Dutch jumper , you know . " " I 'll pay for your hospitalization , " Miss Benson zapped back at her . She 's learning , Delia thought . Delia asked no questions . She looked at the forms , found the line marked with an X for the parental signature , and expertly signed her mother 's name on the information sheet . She had memorized both of her parents ' signatures long ago . Then she stuffed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class asked lots of questions , mostly to delay the start of the lesson . Miss Benson tried to answer every one , seemingly unaware of their delaying tactics . Finally she said , " Okay , that 's enough on that . Class , get out your notebooks . Let 's get started . " Tabu and Titan glared at her in a stony silence from the back of the room . They did not move , and Miss Benson said nothing to them . She looked as if she was trying to pretend that they were n't there . But they never took their eyes off the teacher . It seemed to Delia that they were n't watching Miss Benson to learn but were checking her out for something more sinister . She seemed to be uncomfortable with their hard , unflinching stares , and she made a big deal of passing out books and checking book cards . Delia noticed that she looked everywhere except at the twins in the back of the room . But they never stopped watching her . Delia turned her attention from Tabu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing . The old familiar feeling of dread filled her stomach as Miss Benson began the lesson . Delia took out her notebook and pretended to take notes , but what she wrote was in handwriting so tiny that no one could see what she was writing . But even with a magnifying glass no one could have read what Delia had written . It was all tiny scribble . They were starting a book called Lord of the Flies  --  something about kids in a jungle , she figured from the picture on the front . I 've got to see if there 's a videotape of this , Delia thought . She flipped through the pages and sighed as line after incomprehensible line of gray text stared back at her . She recognized many of the words  --  the shorter ones , and the words that were easy to identify or memorize . But sometimes even those danced around the page like unruly children . Sometimes an easy word like " boy " looked like " yob . " And sometimes it looked like the whole page was written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully to every word Miss Benson was saying . She had an excellent memory and could sometimes tell the teacher word for word what had been said in class the day before . But Delia could n't read .
