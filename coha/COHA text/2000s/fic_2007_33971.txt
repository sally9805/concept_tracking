Chapter One Early to Rise The party really started to rock when Willie Nelson and Queen Nefertiti began pouring shots . I downed one and felt my stomach immediately replaced by a large liquor bonfire that spread through my chest , its flames licking up the inside of my throat . Willie leaned over and whispered that Winnie the Pooh had the hots for me . No way ! I loved that guy ! As I watched Winnie get down on the dance floor , throwing smoldering Pooh Bear glances in my direction , I all of a sudden felt myself floating . Flapping my arms , I rose higher and higher . Soon I was at thirty thousand feet , and a bit chilly . I plucked the edge of the cloud nearest me and draped it over my shoulders , fashioning a cumulus-nimbus pashmina . Feeling quite stylish , I surveyed the landscape below . I checked in with the mountain ranges , the vast oceans , the tiny cities , the- " ... exceptionally long lines at the gas station . Congressman Francis , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " NPR 's Morning Edition crackled into my consciousness to remind me that I was not a party-hopping sorceress but rather a Capitol Hill staffer who only had twenty minutes to get to work . Huh . If I did n't do shots with Willie Nelson and Nefertiti , then why did I feel hungover ? A brief glance into the kitchen brought it all back . Right , the bottle of wine from the ninety-nine-cent store . It had seemed like such a good deal at the time . Okay , twenty minutes . Considering I was supposed to meditate for thirty , I 'd have to postpone that until later . I 'd also have to delay the fifteen-minute stomach crunch set , the do-it-yourself manicure , and the new dictionary word for the day . I promised myself I 'd get to all that , but I knew I was lying . In reality , I would crawl home after working late , feeling too exhausted to do anything but maybe test out some ninety-nine-cent tequila . But it was way too early in the day for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything is possible in the morning . I 'd never been a morning person . I checked the clock . Seventeen minutes and counting . As I fed Shackleton and began scavenging for clean clothes , it occurred to me how difficult these simple tasks would be without my right arm . What would I do if I suddenly lost it in some sort of escalator or escaped hungry lion accident ? People laughed , but I lived only a few short miles from the zoo . So I took a moment to do what I always did whenever these neuroses attacked . I reached for a sling from my pile of medical supplies , fashioned it around my right arm , and continued my routine with this new handicap , confident that I would be the one with the last laugh when I was so ludicrously prepared for life without my right arm . " Amazing , " they 'd all say , " can you stand how quickly she 's adapted ? Why , she 's just as capable as she was before ! Maybe even more so ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true . I 'd just nod and smile and continue my life as a well-prepared , one-armed genius . I snapped myself out of this daydream to concentrate on the extraordinarily difficult task of opening a container of yogurt with just my left hand . And then , as I gathered up my work folders , cleverly using my foot to lift my briefcase up to the table , I caught sight of Shackleton 's mossy gills . Oh no . The mossy gill death sentence . I had managed to inadvertently murder eight Japanese fighting fish over the course of the previous eleven months . I had never meant to kill them . In fact , I did absolutely everything by the book , but they still died . Mr. Lee , the pet store owner , assured me I had n't done anything wrong . I secretly suspected he was keeping something from me-some critical piece of caretaking instruction or water-purifying product that would keep my fish alive-because whatever it was , by withholding it , he ensured my lucrative repeat business . He played the helpful counselor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese fighting fish sometimes just lost their will to live after a simple change in surroundings and performed a sort of fish-style hari-kari . Three of them wasted away , two of them became grossly bloated , and Jacques , Moby , and Ballard had all developed mossy gill disease . I looked sadly at nay ninth and longest-living fish , the six-month trouper whom I thought had changed my luck . Shackleton , so named for miraculously surviving an unfortunate wintertime power outage that had turned his bowl into an icebound wasteland , stared bravely back . Amazingly , he had lived through being thawed out . I had assumed this proved he was some sort of fish messiah , a powerful spiritual leader of the marine realm . But 1 should have known that even the mightiest of fish could n't survive for long in my murderous clutches . I was beginning to obsess about the implications for my fitness as a future mother if I could n't even keep a tiny little fish alive for more than a few months when I caught sight of the clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commute and rushed out the door , barely remembering to shed my sling along the way . The good thing about working for a senator I respected was that I felt like I had a chance to make a positive difference in the world every day . The bad thing was that I worked so hard I did n't have time to notice things like the fact that I was wearing two different shoes until I was already on the Red Line , rapidly approaching my stop . And the pathetic thing was , I probably would n't have noticed at all if I had n't caught the snickering glances of two perfectly groomed Senate pages and looked down to let myself in on the joke . In my opinion , it 's not totally unreasonable to mix up two pairs of shoes of the same style but slightly different colors , like a navy blue and black loafer . Embarrassing , sure , but understandable , particularly if one did n't have a right arm to turn on the closet light while one rooted around with one 's healthy limb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I was fairly certain the only people capable of that would have to be somewhat mentally handicapped . Apparently , they could also be me . I decided to act like I knew exactly what I was doing , and shot a pitying glance at the two page-babes-a glance that communicated how sorry I felt for them that though they were immaculately coiffed , they clearly had n't heard about the newest look to hit the runways . And I , I who read the Economist for fun on the way to work because , yes , I was that smart and genuinely interested in what it had to say , also happened to be on the cutting edge of fashion . How sad for them , my demeanor purred . How fabulous to be me . With that work done , I exited the Metro at Union Station and made my way down First Street to the Russell Senate Building , holding my head high and silently cursing the fact that I did n't have time to run into a shoestore and buy anything that made me look less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if I did have the time , there are some things money just ca n't buy . Janet , the ultracompetent , middle-aged personal aide to the senator , glanced up as I entered the office . While talking on her phone headset , stapling a stack of briefs with one hand , and making a scheduling change with the other ( difficult multitasking even with two perfectly intact arms ) , she also managed to smile at me . " RG 'll be here in five . He needs the committee brief right away , " she said , in her pleasant but no-bullshit tone . " It 's all ready , no problem . " I smiled back , trying to project confidence and professionalism before my first cup of coffee , which was no small feat . RG was office shorthand for Robert Gary , junior senator from my home state of Ohio . The committee brief was for the Senate 's Health Care Committee hearing on prescription drug plans for the elderly , scheduled to begin that morning . And I was responsible for the brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was a domestic policy adviser to Senator Gary . The fact that I had managed to become a health care analyst for a United States senator at the age have given me this sort of authority and fire me on the spot . Born and raised in Ohio , I owed my passion for government to my mother , a political science professor for whom fostering interest in public service came naturally . From the beginning , I 'd been an eager and enthusiastic student . And perhaps most significantly , my mom 's only full-time one . Under her tutelage , I 'd learned early that participation was paramount and that change could be just an effort away . Together , we 'd drawn up campaign posters for local candidates , passed out voter registration forms , and canvassed neighborhoods for initiatives in which we 'd believed . In the mornings before school , she 'd helped me read the newspaper and answered my questions . In the evenings , she 'd edited my letters to the president for spelling mistakes . It had never occurred to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd loved it . I 'd begun taking up my own causes in grade school . I 'd tried to protect the rainforests , adopt litter-free highways , stop animal testing , ship school supplies to impoverished children in Haiti , and generally save the world one bake sale at a time . In high school , I 'd become obsessed with issues of free speech , railing against censorship and challenging the school newspaper to rise above it . I 'd written passionate papers about how freedom and rebellion represented the beating heart of democracy . I had n't been above invoking these themes to denounce the tyranny of dress codes and curfews . I 'd run for class office here and there , but mainly devoted myself to general activism . It had n't been until college , at the University of Cincinnati , that I 'd developed a more specialized interest in health care policy . This interest had grown out of a particularly intriguing freshman seminar on communicable diseases-a seminar which had provoked both a passion for health care reform as well as a terror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From that seminar forward , a sore throat was never just a sore throat-it was much more likely the beginning stages of Ebola , rickets , or wasting disease . Since then , I had dedicated myself to doing the little I could to prepare for the disasters that were sure to befall my relatively defenseless body . I had also devoted myself to studying the complexity and flaws of the country 's health care system . Its inadequacies and inequalities had offended and embarrassed me . I had n't been able to understand how the government could continue to allow nearly forty-four million Americans , many of them children , to go uninsured . I 'd been horrified to discover the price gouging that went on , and the toll that it took on lower- and middle-class families . And as my mother 's daughter , I had resolved to do what I could to bring about change . While slaving away on my thesis , I had landed interviews with Ohio 's nineteen members of the House of Representatives and both senators . Senator Robert Gary had impressed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp of health care issues and his long-term vision . As he 'd answered my questions and talked about his plans for reform , I 'd felt a mixture of awe and inspiration . I 'd sent Gary a copy of my thesis and immediately volunteered for his reelection campaign upon graduation . I 'd been flattered and terrified when he 'd remembered me , complimented my thesis , and asked me to work with his domestic policy team specifically on health care issues . I 'd thrown myself into it , written a couple of noteworthy briefs , and after Gary had won in a landslide , been asked to join his D.C. staff . Which was how I 'd suddenly found myself in a position of real influence . Scary , but true . I barely had time to sync my BlackBerry and scan e-mails before Janet was buzzing my line . " RG 's here . He added a meet-and-greet with the teachers ' union , so you only have ten minutes right now to get him up to speed for the hearing . Go . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be able to brief him in only ten minutes if I did n't have a tongue . I could probably come close if I was equipped with markers and flip charts and more advanced charade talents than I currently possessed , but it would be tough . I 'd been told I had very expressive eyes though , so as long as I could use those ... oooh , no tongue and blind , now that would probably stump me . How exactly would I go about- " Can I help you with something ? " Senator Gary 's sarcastic impatience put an end to my planning by alerting me that I must have been standing in his office looking like an entranced idiot for a good ten seconds . After a quick calculation I decided to pass on explaining that I had been musing a blind , tongueless existence and just get straight to the briefing . " I 'm here to prep you for the hearing , sir . Is now an okay time ? " He just looked at me for a moment and then nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good-looking man and I thought the gray flecks in his dark hair made him look distinguished , but the deepening creases in his forehead and the bags under his eyes just made him look ragged . He was a workaholic with one-year-old twins at home , so that accounted for some of it , but I got the sense he was worrying about something else in the deep , portentous way he often had about him . His blue suit , white shirt , red tie uniform was crisp and pressed as usual , but I noticed he had a yellowish stain on the collar of his shirt . I promised myself I 'd gently bring that up after we got through the briefing . He 'd be grateful without being embarrassed . I knew just the tone I 'd use . " Okay , sir , your committee today will be hearing testimony from Alfred Jackman , a constituent from your old congressional district . He 's eighty-three and suffers from a kidney condition that leaves him in intense pain much of the time . The prescription drugs he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension payments , so he makes regular trips to Canada to obtain the cheaper generic versions that should be available to him here . " " And Medicare in its current incarnation does n't cover what he needs , correct ? " " It does n't come close , sir . " " And the price controls in Canada allow him to save what , forty to sixty percent ? " " He shaves fifty-five percent off his drug costs on average , sir . " RG was nodding and I felt lucky all over again that I worked for someone who actually understood the policy issues he was being briefed on . One of the major shocks of my twenty-six years was the discovery that a distressing number of the people holding the reins of our democracy were glad-handing lightweights . Not RG , though . He actually cared .
