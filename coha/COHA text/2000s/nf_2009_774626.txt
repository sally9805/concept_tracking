" If you and I met at one of our children 's birthday parties , in the hallway at work , or at a neighbor 's barbecue , you 'd never guess my secret : that as a young woman I fell in love with and married a man who beat me regularly and nearly killed me . I was always tensed for my next mistake , his next attack . The only person I was hiding the truth from was myself . " - from Crazy Love //
