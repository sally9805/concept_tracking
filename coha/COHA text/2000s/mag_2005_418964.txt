Discovered cheating with his kids ' babysitter , heartthrob Jude Law makes a stunning public apology . Will his fiance , Sienna Miller , take him back ? // No one could blame actress Sienna Miller for missing work on July 19 . The day before , the star had gamely turned up-though conspicuously without her $35,000 diamond engagement ring from actor Jude Law-at Wyndham 's Theatre in London , where she is performing in Shakespeare 's As You Like It . But the following evening , as the fallout continued from Law 's bombshell public acknowledgment of an affair earlier this year with his children 's nanny , Miller was a noshow for her performance . " We made the decision to give her the night off , " says company stage manager Adrian Storey . " A bit of R &; R. " It 's unlikely that Miller , 23 , was enjoying much quality time in the wake of embarrassingly graphic allegations of her fiance 's infidelity that first surfaced in Britain 's Sunday Mirror on July 17 . In a breathless tell-all interview that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 26 , detailed her liaisons with Law , which she says occurred in March and April while the 32-year-old actor was shooting the upcoming drama All the King 's Men in New Orleans . She told the paper that they shared their first tryst on March 20 after attending a Robert Plant concert together , and that Law made the first move . " He is a great lover and knows how to satisfy a woman , " she said . " We could n't get enough of each other . " Nearly as shocking as Wright 's claims-among other things , she says that one of Law 's children caught them in bed together-was the star 's mea culpa , which he prepared the same day as the Sunday Mirror story ( see box ) . Why confess so publicly ? " He wanted Sienna to know how sorry he was , " says a friend of the Oscar-nominated actor and father of Rafferty , 8 , Iris , 4 , and Rudy , 2 , with ex-wife Sadie Frost . " He wanted to say , " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I did wrong . ' ' " Whether Miller will accept the apology remains in doubt . The actress , who met Law when the pair costarred in last fall 's Alfie remake and was engaged to him last Christmas , has left the couple 's Maida Vale home for an undisclosed countryside locale ; Law also is staying elsewhere and is " devastated , " says a source . Meanwhile , Miller 's furious mother , Josephine , publicly called Law a " a bloody idiot " and told the Daily Mail that Sienna had learned of the alleged indiscretion via the Sunday Mirror story . The scandal is n't Law 's first brush with tabloid drama . His 2003 split from Frost , 40 , came amid reports of infidelity . ( Law never commented on the rumors . ) And during the King 's Men shoot , Law raised eyebrows when he turned up at Larry Flynt 's Hustler Club in New Orleans last December . Frost , whose divorce from Law was finalized in June , told PEOPLE of the current brouhaha , " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Knowing Law , does the news come as a surprise ? " Yes , actually it does . " Currently shooting the drama Breaking and Entering in London , Law " is a professional and he has a job to do , " says a friend , adding that he and Miller " have met " since the revelations came to light . Despite reports that the wedding has been called off , sources say no decision has been made . As for Miller , she must now turn from choosing flowers and gowns to weighing whether to forgive her fianc . " She really does n't know where she 's at right now , " says a friend . " She needs some time to sort all this out . " Sidebar Miller ( with Law at a London fete on June 16 ) " fell hook , line and sinker when she first met Jude , " says a friend . " Following the reports in today 's paper , I just want to say I am deeply ashamed and upset that I 've hurt Sienna and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologize to Sienna and our respective families for the pain I 've caused . There is no defense for my actions , which I deeply regret , and I ask that you respect our privacy at this Very difficult time " - JUDE LAW IN A JULY 17 STATEMENT Sidebar After she allegedly began an affair with Law , " there were a few knowing glances and smiles exchanged between us , " said Wright ( with Law and his son Rudy on the King 's Men set in New Orleans in February ) .
