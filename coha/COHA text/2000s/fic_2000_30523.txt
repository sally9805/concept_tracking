" I refuse to accept it in that condition , " Ace said , glaring at the man who was holding out a clipboard and expecting him to sign the acceptance papers . " Look , mister , I 'm just the deliveryman , and nobody said anything about busted crates . So just sign it so I can get out of here . " Ace kept his hands at his side . " Maybe you ca n't read , but I can , " he said . " The fine print on that contract says that once I accept shipment , it 's my responsibility . That means that if it 's broken , then it 's my problem . But if I find out that it 's broken before I sign , then it 's your problem . Got it ? " For a moment the man stood there opening and closing his mouth . " Do you know what 's in that thing ? " " I most certainly do , since I 'm the one who ordered it . And paid for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to understand . " So let 's get it out of here so we can  --  " " No , " Ace said . " We open it here and now . " At that the man looked about him pointedly , as though Ace did n't understand exactly where they were . They were in the baggage claim area of the Fort Lauderdale airport . Right now there were only a few porters removing unclaimed bags from the carousels , but any minute the escalator to the left might start delivering a plane full of people . " You want me to uncrate the thing here ? Now ? " the man said quietly . " Now , " Ace said firmly . " You put it in my truck , it 's mine , so I have to pay for it if it 's damaged , and I paid too much for it to  --  " " Yeah , yeah , " the man said , bored , then turned to a skinny kid standing next to Ace . The kid was wearing the same gray uniform that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always like that ? " " Naw , sometimes he 's a real pain in the neck . " " I hope you 're gettin ' paid well . " " Actually ... " he began , but a bark from Ace stopped him . " Tim ! You want to get away from that end of the crate ? I do n't want one of my guys touching it until I see that it 's working . " With his back to Ace , the deliveryman grimaced . He was tired and hungry , and worse , he was alone . He 'd have to uncrate the damned thing by himself all because of a little dent in one corner . Using a crowbar , he pried up one side of the fifteen-foot-long crate , and there , lying in a bed of Styrofoam pellets was the remote control . With a wicked little smile that he made sure no one saw , he pocketed the control , then kept on uncrating . When he got to the other end , Ace was bent over the opposite end , peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Psst , " the deliveryman said to the kid in the uniform . The label on his pocket said , Tim , Kendrick Park . " Tim , " the deliveryman said , then handed him the remote control . " Is that what  --  " " Quiet , " the man ordered . " Do n't let him see it . " " Yeah , sure , " Tim said , his eyes wide , looking like a kid with the world 's biggest Nintendo game in his hands . " Just do n't push the buttons , " the deliveryman said , " because the thing will start moving and it 'll scare everybody . " " Yeah ? " Tim said , somehow managing to open his eyes even wider . But Tim could no more resist the temptation than Adam could . The minute the crate was opened enough to see inside the near end , Tim pushed the buttons  --  then was extremely satisfied when a woman behind him gave a yelp of fear . " It 's all right , " Ace said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably a planeload of travelers arriving in the baggage claim . " It 's not real . It 's just a fiberglass alligator sent here from California , and we 're checking it for damages . " At his words the fear left their faces , but they showed no signs of moving closer to the baggage carousel . What some of them had just seen was what looked to be the enormous head of an alligator lift out of a wooden crate and snap its jaws at the man who was fearlessly putting his hands into the long box . When no one so much as moved even an inch in the direction of the luggage , Ace shook his head in exasperation , then turned and snatched the remote from Tim . " Would you help rather than hinder ? " " Sorry , boss , " Tim said , but he did n't look sorry . " I could n't resist it . That thing sure does look real . " " That 's why it cost me every penny I had , " Ace muttered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See if there 's so much as a scratch . " Now that Ace and Tim had taken over , the deliveryman was leaning against the back wall and using a pocket knife to trim his nails . " So how come you do n't have a real alligator ? " he asked . " You runnin ' out of real ones down here ? " He laughed at his own joke . " Too many handbags and shoes ? " Ace had to nearly push a woman aside as she leaned so far over to see inside the crate that she was in the way . " Kendrick Park is a bird sanctuary , " he said , as if that explained everything . When the man looked puzzled , Tim said quietly , " He does n't like to put things in cages , but alligators draw crowds . " The man pondered that for a minute . " I see . So you thought that if you get a fake alligator you 'll get tourists , but ol ' Ivan here wo n't cry crocodile tears of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little witticism . When Ace did n't bother to answer , Tim said , " Exactly . " " You about through with your inspection , Mr. Birdman ? " the deliveryman asked . " The damage on the crate is on the bottom . To do a proper inspection , we 're going to have to take it out and look at its belly . " " Just what my wife says to me every night , " the man said under his breath to Tim , who turned red and choked on his laughter . At the moment his boss did n't look as though he was in the mood for jokes . " Okay , Tim , get the tail . Careful . I do n't want it hurt . Okay , " Ace said a moment later as he looked at the huge alligator replica stretched out full length on the floor . " It looks undamaged . " " So you want to sign this now , so I can go get something to eat ? " " All right , " Ace said , stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he signed the paper saying the terrifically expensive replica was now his responsibility . For a moment he glanced up at the plane passengers that were now surrounding them . They were silent , tired after their flight from New York , or maybe they were just awed at seeing what they had hoped to see on their trip to Florida . Whatever , they were just standing there watching this free show while suitcases went unnoticed , round and round on the carousel . " Okay , so let 's get him back in his box , " Ace said . " Tim , you get the tail , and I 'll get the head . " For a moment , Ace hesitated as he tried to figure out how best to get a grip on the beast . In the next second he inserted his hand , then his arm up to his armpit down the alligator 's mouth . When a collective " Ooooh " went up from the watching crowd , he smiled . This was going to work , he thought . Over on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune with his fake animals , while farms here in Fort Lauderdale were barely able to feed their 450-pound ' gators . And getting ma , pa , and the kids to want to go see a flock of flamingos was a losing proposition  --  and he had the empty bank account to prove it . As Ace and Tim were putting the giant fiberglass alligator back into the box , neither of them saw the inquisitive toddler slip between the suitcases and pick up the remote control that Ace had carefully set on top of his toolbox . The little boy , at eighteen months , just loved to push buttons . " Bloody hell , " Fiona muttered as she disembarked the plane . She 'd had a couple of hangovers in her life , mostly while in college , but nothing like this . Not only did her head hurt , but she could feel even the tiny bones in her ankles . She 'd fallen asleep on the plane , and the attendant had had to wake her , which made her the last one off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pain through her . She and the rest of The Five , as they 'd dubbed themselves as kids , had stayed out until two a.m. , laughing riotously over everything in their lives , but most especially over Fiona 's having to go on a fishing trip . " You ? " Jean had said . " I ca n't imagine you more than two miles from a manicurist . " Jean was a sculptor and her hands always looked scraped and worn . But all four of the women knew that Jean did n't need to do anything to make a living ; she had a trust fund . As Fiona walked into the airport , the bright light coming through the huge windows made her hide her eyes while she fumbled in her bag for the sunglasses she 'd bought at LaGuardia Airport . In New York they 'd seemed so dark she could hardly see through them . But now the glare made them seem like clear glass . The airport seemed empty as she trudged ahead , her aching head filled with nothing but bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days ? Would this man require her to clean fish ? When she stepped onto the escalator leading down to the baggage carousels , the movement almost made her retch . Quickly , she fumbled in her bag for a tissue , then held it to her mouth . Why was she here and what did this man Roy Hudson want with her ? And why Florida ? And if Florida , why not some nice clean , private beach ? Why was he insisting on going into the swamps or whatever to look for  - -  Because Fiona had a tissue to her mouth and her eyes closed , she had descended the escalator without seeing the silent , watching crowd at the bottom . But when she stepped off , she nearly fell on top of a man with a paunch and not much hair . " Pardon me , " she said in a voice as husky as her brain was feeling . The man looked up at her and his face softened . " Any time , " he said , then stepped aside so she could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she did n't think , she just moved . What she saw  --  her eyes blinking behind the dark glasses , her mind full of swamps and alligators and the treachery of the state of Florida  --  was a man with his arm being eaten off by an enormous alligator . As the alligator started to thrash its tail , then move its head from side to side , the man shouted something incomprehensible as he tried to free himself from the attacking reptile . In school Fiona had been the girl with the fastest reaction time in any game , whether it was soccer or pickup sticks , and now she lost no time . Next to her was a woman with an airport luggage cart , and on top of it was a pink bowling ball bag with the name Dixie embroidered on it . Without a thought , Fiona picked up the bag and threw it with all her might at the midsection of the alligator . She was n't prepared for what happened next . The alligator exploded ! It did n't open its mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise , then the whole nasty green thing seemed to fly into thousands of pieces that went flying around the airport . While Fiona stood there in stunned silence , the rest of the people in the airport seemed to go crazy . Instantly there was screaming and shouts of , " Bomb , bomb ! " ; then sirens went off and people started running . Unmoving , still not understanding what had happened , Fiona removed her sunglasses and looked at what she thought had been an alligator . A man came toward her and there seemed to be a double row of teeth attached to his upper arm . Her eyes were on the oddity of the teeth , but when she looked up at the man to ask why he was wearing teeth , she saw that he was furious and he was coming after her . Instinctively , Fiona took a step backward , whereupon she tripped over the luggage cart of the woman who had had the bowling ball bag . But now the woman was gone , probably to join all the many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lady , I 'm going to kill you , " the man said as his hands made for Fiona 's neck . But the alligator teeth , and what looked to be a detached eyeball , slipped down his hands so that both teeth and murderous hands were coming for her throat . Fiona opened her mouth to scream , but no sound came out . But then , just before the man reached her , two security guards and a boy with red hair grabbed the man , teeth and all , and pulled him away . " Thank you so much , " Fiona said when a third and fourth security guard helped her to stand up . " That man should be locked away . He 's a danger to society , and if you do n't  --  Wait a minute ! What do you think you 're doing ? " The guard was pulling Fiona 's hands behind her back and snapping handcuffs on her wrists . " We 're holding you for the police , that 's what . The man says you 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear him over the cacophony of the people in the airport , running every which way , screaming names of people they could n't find . " Bomb ? " she shouted . " I threw a bowling ball bag at an alligator that was eating a man 's arm . " " Yeah , right , " one of the guards said . " We got alligators crawling all over the airports here in Fort Lauderdale . It entertains the tourists to no end . " " But you can ask  --  " " Save it for the police , " the second guard said as the two of them pulled her toward the exit door . " What about my luggage ? You have to call my boss in New York . He can  --  " " Ah . New York , " the first guard said as though that explained everything . Before Fiona could say another word , she was pulled along by the men and led to a car marked Airport Security . Just like on TV , the man shielded her head from getting banged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her inside the car . Shaking with fatigue , Fiona sat down on the dirty bedspread and looked at the telephone on the cheap , battered bedside cabinet . The beautiful hotel where she was supposed to stay had canceled her reservation when she did n't show up before six . At first she 'd politely tried to explain that she 'd been in jail for the last six hours , but when she saw the young female clerk back away as though Fiona were a criminal , she tried threatening . This got her nowhere fast , and the manager soon came out and asked her to leave . So now she was in what had to be the sleaziest motel in all of Florida . It was four a.m. and she had to meet Roy Hudson in two hours . With her hands protected with a tissue ( because who knew what type of person had used this phone last ? ) , she punched the buttons to call Jeremy . When his sleepy voice answered , Fiona burst into tears . " Who is this ? Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jeremy loudly demanded while Fiona tried to get herself together . " It 's me , " she managed to whisper . " Oh , Jeremy , I 've just had  --  " " Fiona , do you know what time it is ? I have to get up and go to work in three hours . " " I have n't been to bed at all . Oh , Jeremy , I 've been in jail . " That got his attention , and she could imagine his sitting up and reaching for a cigarette . She waited a moment until she heard his lighter click , then heard him inhale . " All right , I 'm listening , " he said in his lawyer voice . Maybe he did n't like a girlfriend calling him before dawn , but a client in trouble was a whole other matter . After about ten minutes of listening to Fiona 's semihysterical telling of her outrageous story , Jeremy interrupted . " They let you go ? No charges ? " " What could they charge me with ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saving the man 's life . Not that it was worth much . Did I tell you that the ungrateful jerk tried to murder me ? I ought to sue him . " " Ah . There 's the word . Is he planning to sue you ? What about the people at the airport ? Did anyone have any accidents during the panic you caused ? Heart attacks ? Were any ambulances called ? " " Jeremy ! Whose side are you on ? " " Yours of course , " he said in a tone of dismissal , " but money is money . Did the man say he was going to sue you for destroying his alligator ? " " I do n't know . I do n't remember . They kept us separated after we got to the police station . Oh , Jeremy , it was so horrible , and I wish you were here to hold me . That man  --  " He cut her off . " Did anyone else mention a lawsuit ? What about the airport personnel ? You caused mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly . " Fiona ran her hand over her face . There was no longer any hope that she still wore makeup . " Jeremy , I called you as my friend , not as a lawyer . " " Maybe you 'll need both , so would you please answer my questions ? " Part of her wanted to be babied , hugged and cuddled as best he could over the telephone , but another part of her was sane and sensible . She took a deep breath . " The woman whose bowling ball bag I used came to the police station and said I had to buy her a new bag . And her ball was dented too . " Jeremy let out smoke so fast he nearly choked . " You dented her bowling ball ? " " Do n't start on me , " Fiona snapped . " I 've heard it all from those horrible policemen . I guess I must have put a lot of my anger into that throw because I hit that ... that ... thing pretty hard . " " Enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder . " Remind me never to make you angry at me . So , what did you do about the woman 's bag and ball ? And , by the way , why did n't you call me from the station ? " " Because they said I was n't under arrest , that I was their ' guest ' until this thing was cleared up , therefore I did n't need any fancy-smancy New York lawyer . " " You need to document this . You might have a case for a lawsuit against them . " " I never want to see them again . I gave the woman a check for three hundred dollars and  --  " " You what ! ? " " Paid for the ball I dented , " Fiona half shouted into the phone . " Is n't that what you just asked me ? " Jeremy did n't speak for a moment . " You want to calm down ? " " How can I calm down ? I did n't want to leave Kimberly in the first place ; Garrett made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to sue . He threatened me that if I did n't go on this trip he 'd separate me from Kimberly forever . Can he do that ? " " He 's your boss , " Jeremy said , stubbing out his cigarette . Privately , he thought that it would be a great relief if Fiona were separated from Kimberly . " Look , Fee , honey , I need to get some more sleep . It does n't sound as though you 're in serious trouble , but I 'll call a friend of mine down there in the morning and have him call you . I 'll have him make sure that nothing bad is going to happen to you . " His voice softened . " Now I want you to take a long , hot bath , then get into bed and dream about me . " Finally , Fiona smiled . It seemed that she had n't smiled in days , maybe even in years . " I 'd like that , " she said softly , leaning back against the headboard . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she had to sit up quickly to keep from falling , and the movement broke the spell . " I ca n't , " she said in a little-girl whine . " I have to meet this old man , this Roy Hudson , in just over an hour . " " Ca n't you call and delay the meeting ? " " It 's for "  --  she swallowed  --  " fishing . You have to go out in the boat very early for fishing . Maybe the slimy little things take afternoon naps ; I do n't know . But I have to be there very soon . " " All right , calm down . This man Hudson is rich , so I 'm sure he 'll have a boat with a crew . A yacht probably . Think you could handle a yacht ? Have yourself a few drinks ? Lie in the sun ? " " Drinking is what got me in this mess in the first place , and sun is not going to touch my skin and make me look sixty at forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Be miserable if you want to . Just tell me where you 'll be , so my friend can reach you . " " I 'll be at Kendrick Park until we get on the boat . I think it 's a bird sanctuary , and get this , as if I did n't have enough problems , one of the men on the boat is named Ace . " When Jeremy was silent , Fiona spoke again . " You do n't think that 's funny ? " " Not particularly . What 's wrong with that name ? " She thought about telling him of what she and The Five had come up with about the man , but Jeremy liked The Five as much as he liked Kimberly . " I think it might be a woman thing . " " I 'm sure it is . Look , honey ... " " Yes , I know , you need your beauty sleep . Did I tell you that when I did n't claim my suitcase , they put it into an incinerator ? After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so they did n't need another one . I am here with the clothes on my back and what 's in my pack . " Jeremy yawned . " If I know women , that thing is full of everything you need for a week on a deserted island . " Tightening her lips , Fiona glared at the phone . His chauvinistic comment was one of dismissal , and all his care and concern had been about legal matters . He had n't offered her a word of sympathy for all that she 'd been through . So much for a shoulder to cry on ! " At least your photo was in the bag that got burned up , " she said , then hung up . But the gesture did n't make her feel any better . She had an hour and a half to get ready to meet Roy Hudson .
