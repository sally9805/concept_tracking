The great irony of human intelligence is that the only species on Earth capable of reason , complex-problem solving , long-term planning and consciousness understands so little about the organ that makes it all possible  --  the brain . Scientists ' knowledge of how and why the brain works is patchy at best compared with their awareness of other vital body parts  --  heart , lungs , kidneys , skin . <P> Until Patricia Goldman-Rakic started delving into it , the most important part of the brain , the frontal lobe , was a veritable blank sheet . A gray , wrinkled chunk of tissue tucked behind the forehead and taking up about a third of the total brain mass , it is to the rest of the central nervous system what a CEO is to a modern corporation . It takes sensory data fed to it by the rest of the organization ( smells , sounds , tastes , etc. ) and decides what it all means and what should be done about it . It 's largely responsible for our thinking , planning , intellect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurology and psychiatry at Yale , has spent the past 30 years immersed in the frontal lobe . In the early 1970s , working at the National Institute of Mental Health as one of the few women in the field , she became the first scientist to draw a comprehensive biological map of neuroscience 's terra incognita , showing that its tangled web of neurons is actually a series of columns of highly specialized nerve cells . <P> But Goldman-Rakic is probably best known for her research on working memory , which evolved out of these more fundamental discoveries . Working memory functions in the brain like a yellow sticky Post-it note . It 's the place we put things to recall over the short term . We use working memory when we look up a telephone number and remember it only long enough to dial . We use it on a more basic level to remember the thread of an argument while we are trying to make a point . A brain without working memory is like a computer without its RAM ; its computational abilities are crippled , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontal lobe , such as cerebral palsy , dementia , Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and schizophrenia . <P> But it 's mostly the brains of monkeys , not humans , that Goldman-Rakic studies . This presents certain advantages ( monkey brains are extremely similar to ours , and more invasive studies are allowed ) and certain challenges . How , for example , do you explore the memories of creatures that can not speak ? <P> Peanut and raisin rewards have become the coins of Goldman-Rakic 's realm . In a series of elegant experiments that combine memory tests with electrical recordings from brain tissue , she has learned , for example , that each part of the brain has its own short-term " scratch pad " in the frontal lobe . Within each of these areas , individual neurons are responsible for holding and processing highly specific pieces of information , like the memory of a particular face or voice .
