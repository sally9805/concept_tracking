Chapter One " You a virgin ? " " Excuse me ? " Sociologist Dr. Whitney Foster glanced up from the Alaskan wildlife brochure she was trying to read . But her hands were shaking so badly from a wicked case of preflight jitters that the bouncing words , far from educating her , were making her nauseous . As hard as she 'd been trying to learn about grizzly denning - and in the process , forget she was thousands of miles from home on Christmas Eve - she 'd been trying that much harder to ignore her **29;355;TOOLONG pilot . As well as being gorgeous , he also appeared to be clairvoyant . How could he tell just by looking at her that she had n't been intimate with a guy in ... well , suffice it to say it 'd been a loooong time ? " You all right over there ? Your cheeks look kind of pale . " Whitney shot the little plane 's big pilot her most scholarly glare . " Sure . I 'm , ah , great . After way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career adventure of a lifetime . What could be better than that ? " His slow grin messed with her stomach even more than the clack of the plane 's skis did as they skimmed over bumps on the lake 's ice . " Oh , I can think of a few things . " " Which explains your interest in my virginity ? " " Ma'am ... " While she clutched the sides of her seat interror , he pulled back on the yoke , then winked . What did that mean ? " With all due respect to your bedroom experience or lack thereof , that comment was only my bumbling attempt at making polite conversation . You know , wondering out loud if this is your virgin flight in a small plane ? If I ever ask a female passenger that question again , I 'll rephrase it . " " Oh . Yes . This is my first time . " Whitney moaned inwardly . Where was a nice dark hole to climb into when you really needed one ? Oh well , it was n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how accurate his assessment of her had been . While she was n't technically a virgin , by the time she found a new Mr. Right , that old Madonna song " Like a Virgin " would definitely apply . After aiming one more charming grin her way , he returned his attention to flying , thank goodness . Oh , she knew his type . Cornball-sexy Santa hat that made him look like a fun guy . A rangy build big enough to make a petite woman feel protected . Gulf-of-Alaska-green eyes with an entire tidal chart of perils . Thick dark hair perfect for running her fingers through . Square jaw sporting one of those all-day five o'clock shadows - just prickly-soft enough to tease a girl into thinking she 'd been kissed by a real man , when in reality he was probably a snake . Like another snake who 'd coiled in the bushes , using her to pounce on her supposed best friend . Ha ! As if spoiled Marcie Hawthorne even needed another man - she was an heiress , for heaven 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her last weeks at school , Whitney had heard through the campus grapevine that Rocco was n't even his name . His real name was Ralph Stanley . And he was n't a senior in premed , but a late-night janitor pretending to be a student at Hill-borough College . After being sweetly courted by him for the better part of six months , after knowing deep in her heart that he was the one , Whitney had caught him sleeping with her roommate , Marcie - his new wife . She 'd later found out through still more campus gossip that all along , Rocco had only been using her as an entre to her rich friend . Never had Whitney felt so foolish . She 'd thought she was in love with him . During particularly boring sessions of thesis research , she 'd even practiced writing Mrs. Rocco Stone in flowing script . Even worse , what with the less-than-stellar example her own parents had set with their love life , Whitney should have known better than to fall for a guy like him - or any guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous absences from the defining moments of her life , had proven that she would 've been far happier never even knowing him . At least then she would n't have been so heartbroken when he had n't shown up for her elementary-school Christmas choir concerts or high-school musicals or even her graduation . Talk about leading by example . If she ever had kids , she 'd darn well raise them on her own . She would 've been much better off without a dad . Her children would be , too . And then there was her mom . Another great example of how not to lead your life . Her mom had long since shown Whitney that all males were dangerous with a capital D. Trouble was , Candace **35;386;TOOLONG did n't find men dangerous - she found them fascinating . She did n't just fall for every guy she met - she married him ! As a result , she 'd become so reliant on men that she hardly answered the door anymore without asking her latest hubby for his opinion . Whitney loved her mother dearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greener pastures when she was ten , it 'd really thrown her mom for a loop . But instead of figuring out how to make her own way in the world , Candace had turned to wedding rings for support . Whitney , on the other hand - aside from her brief lapse of judgment in dating Rocco - had prided herself on being as self-reliant as they come . Once the initial rocket launch into a gray winter sky evened into an only mildly bumpy ride , Whitney tried to relax by counting the plastic red berries on the silver garland lining the plane 's curved ceiling .
