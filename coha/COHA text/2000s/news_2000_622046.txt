<p> HONORING THE MEMORY OF GRAHAM <p> Editor  --  Regarding Joel Selvin 's article ( " Presenting Bill Graham , " May 10 ) about the new Bill Graham play : <p> I met Bill Graham when I was very young , around 17 or 18 . <p> Having grown up in the Haight-Ashbury , we would see him often in the Panhandle , the park and later at the Moe ( Fillmore ) . <p> Once he and I stood back to back outside Winterland while he was being jumped by some young hoods , and we fought them off . <p> Bill yelled , screamed and did his thing , but no one ( else ) was as honest and as good-hearted as Bill . I wish he could have lived to see all the wonderful things that have happened since he died . Whatever faults the man may have had , he still was the best at what he did . Getting yelled at by Bill Graham was a honor . <p> KENNETH WORTHINGTON <p> Northfield , VT <p> BAD SOUND AT BECK <p> Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Theater of the Absurd , " May 4 ) of the Beck concert was completely on the mark . <p> However , I was frustrated that he did n't make a point of how bad the sound was . The first half of the show was just cacophony . I was unable to distinguish one instrument from an other and could understand very little of what Beck was saying . <p> The responsibility for this bad sound is somewhat Beck 's fault , but mostly it is the fault of Bill Graham Civic Auditorium . I have never been to a show there that was n't compromised by the echoes and deadening of sound . <p> RICHARD COBEEN <p> Berkeley <p> LITTLE MAN IS SHALLOW <p> Editor  --  Bill Schwartz 's letter ( April 25 ) makes a number of valid points concerning use of the Little Man , especially in regard to local theater . The Chronicle 's critics seem to me , by and large , to be experienced , fair-minded and as tough-minded as is imperative . But can they themselves be happy to have their thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two varieties of yes ? It occurs to me that this reduction of serious criticism to a visual logo is rendered even more specious by your company 's recent decision to employ the Little Man  --  leaping , of course  --  as the logo for the newly renamed Concord Pavilion . Will all performances there from now on be outstanding ? <p> ROBERT DANTZLER <p> San Francisco <p> HARD TO HEAR <p> Editor  --  The suit by the hearing impaired against big movie chains for closed-captions should be joined by the AARP and supported by all other senior organizations . <p> From all the complaints I hear , I am sure that millions of us seniors with all levels of hearing disabilities stay away from movie theaters because the producers fail to recognize in how many ways sound isolates and irritates us . <p> Overpowering music and background noise can make it hard to follow a movie . Strong dialects can also cause many of us to skip movies we would otherwise pay to see . It 's often easier to comprehend TV movies that are closed-captioned . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could comprehend the full story and follow the lyrics to the music . <p> HARRY HOWARD <p> Rohnert Park <p> MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD <p> Editor  --  I can not believe Susie Landers ' letter ( May 2 ) blaming public-address announcer Renel for the Giants ' loss . Talk about scapegoating ! Renel 's doing a fine job , following in the very professional tradition of Sherry Davis . Baseball does n't have cheerleaders like some other sports , thank goodness . The last thing we need in our beautiful new ballpark is a showoff carnival-style announcer . <p> Maybe the reason the crowd was n't excited enough is because there were n't a lot of real baseball fans there . Giants baseball has grown in popularity and is now attracting many nonfans . I welcome rookie fans to the new park and invite them to stick around for possible losing seasons , as some of us have done over the years . Meanwhile , veteran fans in the crowd , like Susie and her dad , should set a good example by yelling their hearts out as needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNOB <p> Editor  --  De we really need snobs like John Carman guiding us through the labyrinth of prime-time television ? Nothing seems good enough for this aficionado of mass culture . In the past few months he has trashed informative and competently produced docudramas about the Beach Boys , Audrey Hepburn and the Three Stooges . These shows may not have been in the highest traditions of deep research or theater , but they all dealt with entertainment icons and gave viewers valuable insights into the backgrounds and lives of these very real people . <p> This is what television can do well . Critics of this medium who fashion themselves to be so far above and beyond the common sensibility are not doing readers any good by using their columns as self-indulgent exercises in pampering and massaging their own idiosyncratic arrogance . <p> MARCUS O'REALIUS <p> Berkeley <p> MUSIC FOR THE MASSES <p> Editor  --  For the past decade , the music industry has been a sleeping giant . Fearing an erosion of profit margins at traditional " bricks and mortar " outlets , it failed to immediately see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced inventory and distribution costs , and greater track ing of consumer spending . Instead , small entrepreneurs saw the potential and jumped at the opportunity . <p> Now that the industry is so far behind , it 's wasting time and money with lawsuits against such entrepreneurs as MP3.com and Napster . These lawsuits are opposing great gains in technology at a cost not only to the consumer but also of music quality and diversity . These lawsuits show how much of a cartel the music industry is . Think about it : I 've been paying $17.99 for a CD for more than 15 years now ! All other products come down in price where competition really exists or has been created . We need to support in whatever way possible the innovation that the Web is bringing . <p> JOHN HESSE <p> San Francisco <p> MUSEUM 'S TRUE COLORS <p> Editor  --  How tragic to learn that SFMOMA has engaged in a lawsuit against the children of Madeleine Haas Russell over the acquisition of the Picasso left to them by their mother upon her death . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in being a primary part of the city 's visitor 's bureau by showing off a " blockbuster " painting than spending money on in teresting and experimental works of contemporary art . <p> Yet far worse , SFMOMA has placed its emphasis on greed and status above respect for Russell , her generosity during her lifetime and her wishes for her paintings to go to her children to do with as they wish  --  which is a private matter . Aside from the destructive impact on the family and community , this lawsuit is a huge expenditure of time , energy and money that could be better spent seeking the purchase of other artworks and developing other shows . <p> Being born and raised in San Francisco and having lived in Sausalito almost all of my life ( nearly 70 years ) , I have grown up with a strong interest in and close ties to the art scene in San Francisco , and with respect for the generosity of people like Russell . <p> My husband and I are both so disappointed by SFMOMA that we are resigning our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Daily Datebook , The San Francisco Chronicle , 901 Mission St. , San Francisco , CA 94103 ; or fax to ( 415 ) 495-2067 ; or e-mail to datebook@sfgate.com .
