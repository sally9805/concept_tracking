Chapter One Shan And Brianna " Gurrll , guess what ? " Shan was almost jumping up and down as she shouted at her best friend Brianna through the phone . " Why are you screaming ? " Brianna asked with obvious agitation . " I got the job , girl ! I got the J-mutha fuckin ' O-B ! " " Which one ? You done interviewed with damn near fifty thousand people . " " The computer instructor for the prison , FCI Memphis . They just hung up . " Brianna sucked her teeth and rolled her eyes . " It took them long enough . I would have changed my mind . I do n't see why you want to work for the prison system or work , period ! All these niggas out here with money . " " Bitch , please ! Everybody ai n't a gold diggin ' hoe like you . I need my own cash and I do n't want to suck dicks to get it ! " " You better get with the program . What the fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no excuse for bitches like us to be broke ! " Brianna shrieked in bewilderment . " And the last time I checked you were talking to two niggas ! Where are they ! You ditched them ? Sometimes I do n't understand your line of thinking . " Then she frowned . " Working at a prison ? " " Bitch , just because you were in the BOP , and I choose to work for the BOP , do n't hate . Congratulate ! Plus , I 've only been kickin ' it with Calvin for a month . He likes me because hesees it ai n't all about the cash with me . I 'd rather get my own and have my own . " " Girlfriend , please ! Do you hear yourself ? Like I said , you better step up your game and get with the program . You can fall for that weak shit if you want . That nigga knows it 's all about the cash . Niggas ai n't nothin ' but tricks . " " Do you , B , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to help me celebrate or what ? " " Like I said , if you were on top of your game- " " Girl , " Shan interrupted , " I bet you even hustle niggas in your sleep ! Do n't you ? " They both burst out laughing . Brianna knew for sure that Shan was telling the truth . " Let me make a few phone calls and I 'll call you around nine . Dress to impress . You know I got ta kill two birds with one stone . I'ma celebrate with you and see who I can get with later . " Brianna said . " Yeah , I know how you do . But do n't worry about me dressing to impress . You just make sure you are here by nine . Do n't call at nine . Be here at nine ! Peace out . " " Wait . What are you getting ready to do ? " Brianna asked . " Take a beauty nap . What you think ? " " Whatever , hoe . Do you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up the phone she dialed Yolanda , her hairdresser . " Landa , what 's up ? This is Brianna . " " I know who this is . " She snapped . " What do you want ? I have two bitches under the dryer , two at the sinks , the one in my chair and three waiting . You just came here two days ago , so no , I ca n't squeeze you in ! " Yolanda rattled off . Brianna sucked her teeth and rolled her eyes . " How do you know that 's why I 'm calling ? " Brianna was busted . " Hoe , I know you , so stop playing games . I told you I 'm busy . " " Too busy for an eight-pack on top of what I usually pay ? " Yolanda was thinking . Her regular fee plus an eight ball of coke ? " Yeah . That 's what I thought . " Brianna snapped back . " What 's the best time to come ? " " Be here at two , Brianna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shit ! " Brianna hung up without responding . She stood in front of the mirror as she pinned up her $1,200 weave . " Where should we go tonight ? " she asked the mirror . It was Friday night , and she wanted to take full advantage of it . Her girl , Shan , loved the hip-hop clubs , but B 's first preference was anything where the real ballers hung , so she knew she had to choose the spot . Her and Shan had been friends since the third grade . Everyone thought that they were family . Shan was closer to Brianna than her own blood sister . Unforeseen forces bound them closer together , like when Shan 's parents were killed in that fatal car accident , and when Brianna got pregnant in the seventh grade and her mother put her out . They really leaned on one another . Even though Brianna lost the baby , her mother still would n't take her back . When social services came and took Shan and her brother , Peanut , away , Brianna was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group home , that 's when they took Brianna off the streets . Her mother did n't allow her back home until she went to the tenth grade . Other than their copper complexions , they were night and day in just about every way . Brianna had those full pouty lips , while Shan had dainty sensuous ones . Brianna 's nose was full ; Shan 's was a cute little button . Brianna 's onion screamed , " Goddamn ! " Shan 's onion screamed , " Dayuum ! " Brianna was tall and Shan was short . Brianna had to wear Gucci , Prada , and Chanel , while Shan preferred Sean John , Baby Phat , and FUBU . Brianna had the weave , fake nails , and boob job , while Shan had the locks , sported her real nails and refused to do the makeup thing . Brianna went to prison , while Shan now chose to work at a prison . Brianna lived large off the ballers , while Shan preferred the legit businessman or blue collar worker . Which is why everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years . ( Continues ... )
