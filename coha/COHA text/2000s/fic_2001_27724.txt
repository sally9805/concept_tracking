Cannibal Kings The sky is a crowded attic . Clouds at different heights look like old chairs and cushions , stuffed heads of animals , wheels , instruments , a claw-foot tub . Davis stands below , chilled on a street corner , having stepped from his bus into Seattle 's Chinatown . He is sniffing the air and wondering if the patrons in that restaurant will turn and look at him , notice him , hands in pockets , on the sidewalk , sniffing . He waits for a look , but the eaters keep on earing . Most people in windows never run . He will , within days , be in a well-furnished room on the edge of a school campus , staring at a boy who picks his scabs and eats them , and soon enough he 'll find it too much to take , somehow , the draped and fringed plaid curtains , the lacrosse sticks nailed to the walls , the framed painting of snow in a schoolyard , after these long days of snow , and soon enough he 'll think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cougar mind might function , drifting back on the wet odor of light in spring . Davis will remember this smell of humbow , catfish hot-pot grease , green onion in the moist gray air , which seems to carry scents on platters toward him , the invisible waiters of the air , the carts of soft wind . He must be hungry , but do not misunderstand him . Do not mistake his poverty for vanity , because it seems so in the circumstances : well-off parents , decent schooling , and a familiarity with drinks and ties and the small precious food rich people eat . He has an idea of himself so strong now that he 's quit his jobsuch an ideahas not come often in Davis 's life . He has a sense that a thing his stepmother told him as a teenager might be truethat he might " have an eye for things . " For what things ? He does n't know . Better things , delicate or broad , maybe for buildings or fractal design . Who knows ? The purpose of joblessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick it into seeing its own talent . His only talent , you see . It has only just occurred to him that he might have oneand how lucky if it were true ! He has no ready cash , though , for tricking his eye , and he does n't know how long that will take , so he 's been working in his apartment this whole January , turning the heat down by degrees until he realized , just the other day , that a vase of daisies left unattended had frozenor that 's the story he tells . This job he 's heading to now is a piece of luck , then , a coin found in the street . His friend ( more an acquaintance ) Margaret has been tutoring young Vietnamese boys for prep school exams , teaching them the tricks to getting in , the kinds of words prep schoolers should know , the importance of metaphor " tornado is to wind as maelstrom is to ... " Usually she also accompanies these boys on their interviews , sitting in plush rooms and convincing stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , amazing things the blinking boy might do . But this time , with this young boy Trung , Margaret ca n't be with him . Someone else has to lead him into rooms with overlapping rugs and grinningly read his soft palm aloud . A stand-in tutor . A fraud . So that is the job , you see . Davis is to pose as Trung 's close friend , his mentor and instructor , and paint him like a hero to the committee , the principal , the dean or whomever . Three days of driving to schools and this intense lie , but Davis is at an age when lying is a common thing , something tied together intricately with all the interviewing he has done , for jobs , for grants , for college , and even for prep schools . Do n't judge himcould he really say , " I 'm an aimless young man who is just looking forward to lunch " ? Thus his only experience for the job at hand is not a degree in English , but his acquaintance with brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how to sing in a quartet . The interview goes well , you should knowthe one with the parents . A small apartment of stiff green colonial furniture , Vietnamese health calendars tacked to the walls , a stunted , tinkling chandelier . The parents ask him few questions , and Davis asks only the ones that he prepared to seem professional . As if this were a profession of some sort , to pose as something else , to fake your way through another job . The mother is thin , smiling , her forehead creased with worry , turning always to the hidden kitchen , which makes her black ponytail flip against the wall . The father is stout and tired , wearing a red apron . He has only taken a moment off from his grocery store downstairs . Surely they are thinking this is taking too longwhy is he talking so much , this young blond man ? This droop-eyed young man touching pink hands to his even pinker face , babbling through his thick chapped lips ? Is n't this already settled ? Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is looking at the head now peeking from the kitchen steam , a small boy in an oversized red college T-shirt , chewing on his palm . The skin of that palm seems soft , unathletic , unused to helping at the grocery store . There is the smudge of a birthmark on his cheek , and Trung ( for it must be Trung ) is staring , the kind of stare you make when you think no one else can see you , but Davis can see him . Davis waves to no response , just the gnawing mouth on the hand , the birthmark bobbing on the ripples of motion . Davis smells the raw steam and thinks of his long January . Cabbage , chili oil , sweet lemongrass , and chicken fat . * * * What follows are a series of long waits in rental-car agencies , long pauses in conversation , as if breath were being conserved , long , blinkless stares into the sky , seeing the impossible flakes of snow first appearing , the snow that rarely comes to Seattle at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind or sudden sighs of rain . But we never remember pauses or silences , in the way we never notice all the bare sheets round a sleeping body . Davis has been trying on this car ride south to Centralia , to St. George 's Boys ' School on a plot of old farmland , trying to puzzle together some sense of this young Vietnamese boy quietly breathing from the red hood of his thick coat . The coat is too large for him , too new-looking to be a hand-me-down , too long to have been meant for his growth spurtinstead , the kind of coat that might make a child think you did n't know him , or meant it for some future him , some teenager too far off to recognize yet . Davis teases Trung with jokes , tries to learn his favorite music , his secret habits , his talents , but Trung is hopeless . " How about food ? What 's your favorite food ? Mine 's hamburger . " " Human brains . " " That 's not food , Trung . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is that Vietnamese ? " Just a glance of wide , fascinated eyes from beneath the hood , a murmur too thin to make out in the heaving sound of the rental car 's heater . Despite his reticence , it 's clear he likes Davis . The sign is this barrage of unnerving answers to everything . " TV shows ? Sports ? " " My favorite sport is human brains . " " That 's becoming clear , Trung . " " My name is not Trung . It is Davis . " " But that 's my name . " " Now it is mine . " On and on in this way , the snow soundlessly filling the air like summer light . Davis does not notice this , brightness on a day whose sky is taut with clouds , although summer comes to him on its own , in memory , the chalky smell of tomato vines , the scent of their warm skin pressed to his nose , the feeling of tiny hairs on the fruit , and cigarette smoke pushing through summer like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with summer . An actress in town for a Shakespeare festival , her hair always in a braid , her voice choppy and rough , corn being husked , happy to hold hands with him , or sneak down to the lake at night to swim , or kayak into the salt water ; almost anything he wanted to do , she did , without judging , giving her few spare hours of time to him , usually sunset hours , letting Davis lead her . He has been penning a letter on the surface of his brain , a letter to her , something to let her know how close to him she really got . At lunchtime , Davis begins to talk to Trung . About art , and how like Davis the boy is , with generous parents , a future at a boarding school , a future bright with learning and prospects and amber light and those things . Davis is filling the space between them with words , as his stepmother always does at dinner . Trung listens more intently than he should , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . He believes in Davis now , somehow , and tries to remember these important words . He is so young still . Corned beef salted , damp cooked greens , warm sausage gravy on potatoes . * * * The first interview is fine , easier than Davis thought it would be , nothing more than a visit with Trung in the office of a kindly dean of students , tropical plants potted everywhere , great cabbage roses blooming on the wallpaper , a soft pink rug . The snow outside has stopped and there is sunlight for a momentDavis has been concerned for some time about the tires on his car , and now it looks like there is no storm coming after all , just a light film he can see covering the broad green , not even enough for the snowballing boys careening past the window . The questions are simple , broad , all about Trung 's goals and favorite subjects . Whenever Trung pauses , Davis fills in the details with something he 's learned on the car trip , something Margaret has taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , which is half made up , but which goes over so well with the dean that Davis will always use it in the interviews . " He has an eye , " Davis adds with a peaceful smile , and the dean shares his smile , tangling her fingers . Trung sits and says something about a superhero he admires , and this seems charming also . Davis is then asked to leave , and as he waits in the grand hall , a two-storied library ringed with balconies surely no student ever uses , he thinks how used to lying he has become . This is a pleasant thought . He sits back in the thick leather chair , not noticing the light fall of snow again , and he is relieved that he can be a fraud . So much in his life he is expected to have done ; now it is nice simply to pretend . His school was n't like this one . He has to admit his was even nicer . Even the most cramped first-term lodgings were of wood , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn-of-the-century boys ' books in them . Davis remembers his school vaguely and therefore fondly , and one reason memories have not stuck firmly is that he was n't much of a superstar there . There were plenty of boys , rich or funny or handsome , who demanded cults , but Davis was n't any of these things , and as time went on , he became less rich , less funny , and his looks were never boyish again except for the ruddiness of his rough skin . The friendships he made turned out to be frail things , fading outside the greenhouse of school years , so Davis is left with forced nostalgia , droll anecdotes of lonely nights and boyhood cruelties he says he " had to have " to continue into adulthood . It was all for a purpose . There is another drive , to a nearby rural boarding school , this one more severe , and though this time Davis finds himself having to perform without Trung there as a prop , alone with a counselor in a high attic room of the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who bends over his desk , looks over his silver glasses , Davis does fine . He is riskier this timehe makes up stories about Trung , about the time the two of them went sea kayaking together on Lake Union , tossing back and forth small poems in English they had memorized . The next time he tells this story , he will smile as if it were real memory , and the time after that , when the snow has fallen so deep that drifts can hide a young boy , it will feel just like memory . Davis will barely be able to tell the difference . That night , in a motel recommended by the secretary , they order room service on the parents ' money , an extra order of sweet-potato fries , two hamburgers oozing blood jeweled with fat . Trung eats only a third of his and watches , chewing on the fleshy mound of his palm , speaking now and then about how Davis eats too much . He even eats Trung 's leftovers . " Tell me about your friends , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him yet to ask about this subject , which might be crucial for interviews . Trung , in blue satiny pajama bottoms , raises his eyebrows and spreads his words out from a jutting lower lip : " I 've got two friends , Sang and Randy . We are always at Sang 's house . " " What do you do ? " " Draw pictures . " He grins at his false tutor . " Of car accidents . " " So you like art ? You like drawing , then ? See , I tricked you . " But Trung is still grinning , his birthmark bounced up near his eye : " Cracked bones , split skulls , oozing brains ! " " Stop it , Trung , " says Davis , putting down his hamburger . " Once we had a party and one boy cut his fingertip off ! " A rally of guffawing as Davis sits unprepared to react , cracking half a smile to seem game , wondering if this joke is meant to draw him close or frighten him . Davis 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped tobacco so as not to get caught smoking , one boy still wetting his bed , another full of dirty jokes and a disturbing wandering eye , all of them terribly frightened of the boys who seemed capable , athletic and sure , talented and awarded by the faculty . Davis 's friends lingered , clearing their throats , in the halls after basketball games , smelling the success they would never really get , all later tripping over their own doubts into careers in disparate fields , all similar in their vague duties to help the salesmen , partners , vice presidents who really made the deals . In their youth , though , one of their favorite games was to all dress up in black , paint their faces dark , and stand in the shadow of the bell tower , seeing if people would notice the glow of their white eyes in the darkness . Few people did , and this was success for Davis and his friends . Their sorry purpose was to disappear voluntarily . Trung calls his parents for the first time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned away from Davis . He talks in a language probably no one in the building understands , but the tone is all too familiarbored , tired answers . Long pauses , then something meaning , Okay , okay , I will . He carefully hangs up the phone and climbs into his bed . From under the wool blanket , he calls out good night in English . Davis thinks about himself at this age , not as mysterious at all . Bright and talkative , impressive to adults in a way Trung has not proved himself to bebut the son of academics has to be this way , has to grow up able to perform at cocktail parties , play a piano , recite a verse , show early signs of mastery . Davis thinks often about his family . His mother left before he knew her , and his father left when he was fifteen , not long after Trung 's age . Just a stepmother to bring him up from there , all wooden beads and velvet hats , a woman thrilled by so much because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be a potter , taking up a new job to tend to him . There was no one else to watch , so she did it ; she watched his different selves as they emergedthe invisible boy , the vain teenager , the opinionated young man , the graduate moving from job to job like a donkey stumbling into gopher holes . Davis thinks back on himself , not clearlywhen did this " eye " of his first appear ? So much of him is gone , replaced . The fries grow colder as Trung falls asleep , buttering his hair with their sweet smell . * * * Today , the sky is clenched in a fist . Overnight , snow has conquered everything , and as Davis rises to the window , he breathes twice quickly to see how everything has changed . Travel will be tough today . Despite the trouble , despite the slow pace and skidding wheels , the sight of cars abandoned in the meadows , which yesterday were green , the interviews go well indeed . Davis and Trung have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then drive a long way to a quaint town on a peninsula , a town attached to an old abandoned fort . The houses are clapboard , pink and yellow . Snow piles in the flower boxes . Things look a bit abandoned , the people kind but desperate . The interviewers are impressed that Trung and Davis would survive the snow , as if it were a question of survival . In fact , the halls of both schools are packed with muffin tables and silver urns of hot chocolate , and it is clear that even faculty have been trapped here by the snow , staying the night out on this peninsula . The schoolboys look wild and excited , throwing snow everywhere , and their eyes catch Trung as if to bring him with them , make him wild again with them . Trung 's head follows them as he passes into the warm offices of admissions . The interview rooms are soft and bright with light , although the sunlight has left by the time of the second interview . Both deans are in thick sweaters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrill of imminent disaster . Both are distracted from the interview , from such a distant thing as a future student ; they are instead dreaming of tomorrow , the snow three feet above the grass , the chapel bells tolling , offices locked , the cafeteria loud with impromptu talent shows , a Latin chorus , a scene from the school play . And time . Time at last . Davis does n't notice . He tells his story about the kayaks and poems , about Trung 's " eye , " about the wonderful staring boy in the too-big red coat . Trung refuses to remove the coat , and clicking sounds keep emanating from underneath the hood , bizarre little sounds that Davis tries to cover with the tone of his voice . Yet they are there , click crack , click crack . Who is this boy ? Davis rambles on about a Shakespeare festival they attended . The deans lean back , smiling , flushed with pleasure , tapping their pens softly on their blotters . Davis 's voice is a lullaby to deans . Cafeteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet wool and bleach . There is another ferry today , the second . The clouds shift overhead in their intricate designs , a high net for the screaming gulls , and the wind on the upper deck is incredible . Trung presses against Davis , asking to go below , but Davis pats him and says , " Another minute , just a minute . " The Olympic Mountains are out in spiny glory , glowing with ice , and the Sound stretches endlessly between the banks of pure snow , snow broken by nothing , not even by docks , a landscape utterly content with itself , and there is no way to think of this as familiar anymore , as civilized . The area seems remote , as far from things as Davis could ever hope to be . Nothing is traveling along the mountain roads . No yacht sways by with Christmas lights . No seaplane leaves no growling trail . Around a curve , when the ferry finally docks on Whidbey Island , he and Trung run into someone Davis knows . A young woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is small and thin , her head shaved , with just the shadow of hair , everything on her striped or brightly colored : her scarves , buttons , eyes . " Davy Boy ! " she calls him , and he is delighted to see how much she remembers him . He takes it as a sign that her friend , the girl he thinks now he might love , talks of him . " Davy Boy , what are you doing here ? Who is this ? " she asks , and then he has to explain the situation , and somehow it sounds even more ridiculous than ever , as if the job itself were the lie , a subterfuge for getting Trung across the Canadian border . Even the shaved-head girl seems doubtful . She offers no information about the girl Davis loves , says only , " You know her , into everything , like a cat ! " and then the whistle sounds and she must run off to catch her boat . They wave good-bye , and Trung asks , " Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's my girlfriend 's best friend , though . " Trung looks back and chews on his hand , his childish habit . " She is my girlfriend , " he says quietly . " Sounds good . " Their next hotel , their last one on this trip , is far fancier than Davis imagined when he made the reservations . Columns , a fireplace in the lobby , and the clatter of a formal dining room just closing up . It is dark outside , the air cold and curtained with snow , but inside all is warm at the Lawrence Inn . Their room sits cozily under two dormer windows , shades pulled , and everything is prim and neatly matched , woolen blankets and green-pink-striped chairs , satin curtains , bright Dutch plates hanging on the walls . They are high above the nearby boys school , in this richly furnished room , and it all seems to Davis like they are unexpected travelers from the snowbound world , shown into the attic room of a manor house while the ogre-master is off hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresser . He sits on the bedsheet , smoothing the quilt , staring at the fabric . Surely he has never known a room like this , not coming from that close , steamy apartment over the grocery store , not with his poor parents saving pennies from the till for his new life in prep school . How will he explain it to his friends ? The taste of it ? Davis opens the shade . They look out on the campus , ghostly white squares . A fire is burning somewhere , and he can almost smell the smoke of it . Snow is still falling ; there is no end . He turns back to Trung 's fearful expression , the ever-look of adolescence . " I remember a snow like this , actually , " Davis says matter-of-factly , filling the air again . He 's been talking like this for days now , telling Trung these kinds of reminiscences . This time he stands by the window with one hand on the slick green drape , the slight smile on his pink face warping his thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , so pale that only now are they visible . He has the kind of light eyebrows that you can only assume are there when he lifts them to speak : " It was the winter of the cougar . That 's what we called it , because a cougar 'd been trapped down in the city by the snow . " Trung giggles and puts his hand over his mouth . Arm by arm , he is finally removing his red coat . " No , really ! " Davis insists , leaning his head gently and letting his mouth lines wrinkle in cloth folds . " No , it came down from the mountains somehow , before Seattle was as big as now . It still happens . But this cougar got caught in the snow with all of us , and you 'd hear about it from time to timesomebody 's cat got eaten , or a pair of rabbits . Usually that , pets . It was hungry , you know , out of the mountains . What I remember is that the children had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cougar had eaten a child . It had a taste for our children . Maybe it was a rumor , but we were all told we could be eaten out there . We had to stay inside , we could n't even play in the snow ! Can you believe it ? My one memory of a snowstorm . " Trung smiles tentatively , eyes gleaming . Davis chuckles , clicks his tongue , and turns back to the still scene of Lawrence School huddled in itself , remembering less laughingly now the time when he was too young , the right size for a cougar in winter . He thinks about what he has known for hours now , since the ferry ride , that the girl in braids from last summer does n't think about him at all , does n't miss him , that to her in California he is as distant as a meal that she once ordered . A form , a remembered odor . And that this is no surprise , that he has already known this . Love was just a story he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he touches his tongue to it , cold butter . * * * The last interview is at the Lawrence School . They are snowbound . There is no light in the air that does not seem to come from the snow , and no movement except its sandy drifting . Davis and Trung trudge down the hill from their hotel room , their good shoes covered in plastic bags , making their way toward the pointed chapel roof , echoes bringing the sifting noise of their steps . The world smells of nothing . After a while , Trung walks behind Davis 's footprints to make his work easier . Davis does not talk much , does not prepare Trung for the interview ahead , remind him of his talents , his " eye , " his fluency in English , or his hidden brilliances , which will never show up on tests . Instead , just the rasp of breath and step through snow . At the interview room , at the door of this room bright as a greenhouse , Davis is stopped and only Trung is allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , says the secretary as she smiles . Davis sees Trung 's glance over the shoulder of his enormous red coat , frightened , picking at the scab that has formed on his left hand . Davis makes a grinning salute and sits down himself in the waiting room . The windows are draped and fringed with plaid curtains , and lacrosse sticks are nailed opposite him . There is a gleaming urn of cider , the tower of Styrofoam coffee cups stacked , a white segmented thing . The air is all cinnamon . The snow entraps the room . It rises to the level of the windows . How could one sit and read a magazine with snow nosed up against the windowpane like that ? Davis sits , hands folded , in a plastic chair as the secretary types at her low desk . He thinks of his stepmother brooding over burnt pottery projects in her cold flat . He thinks of the girl with braids ranging over San Francisco , sunlit and forgetful , eating a mango or a pear flown from the summer hemisphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting past that wall from him , chewing his fingernails or fingers , the boy who seems so unformed to Davis , his fearful looks clashing with his unnerving comments . Who is he becoming ? What was he like even a year before ? Odder ? More like a child ? Davis thinks of the haphazard crew of people he 's ended up with , how ill-matched they all are for one another , hoping it is part of some plan , these random influences , and not necessarily a grand scheme . A little plan , with tiny gears . Someone 's plan for him . Davis is soon called in by the dean , and he enters a hallway covered with sport photographs in gilt frames , athletes and club presidents from a century of Lawrence School . He passes Trung at the doorway with a pat on his black head . Trung looks up with an open mouth , a sudden smile as he grabs for Davis , maybe for his hair , but then they 've passed and Trung is off into the waiting room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a polished black chair , grinning nervously at the dean . " You 're the boy 's tutor ? " " Yes . " Davis shifts and looks at the man , trim and middle-aged , his hair and glasses a decade out of style , his hands large and rough as they sort papers . Half of a tongue sandwich sits damp on his desk , sloughing its wax-paper skin . The dean looks up again . " I should tell you that Trung just told me all about it . " " What 's that ? " The dean smiles . " He told me you 're being paid by his parents to pretend to be his tutor . " Davis laughs , leaning his long roseate face back into the window 's glare . What else could he do ? " That 's a funny way of putting it , " he says . " But I guess that 's true . " " So you 're not his tutor ? " " Well , " Davis says , still smiling , eyeing the sandwich . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the young man goes on explaining , in a clear way , how he is still qualified to talk on Trung 's behalf , all the time allowing his mind to sit stunned , speechless . Why has Trung said this ? Has he been doing this all along , allowing Davis to spin out his stories of kayaks and poetry and art while the boy waits to whisper secretly in the deans ' ears , his birthmark bobbing happily , telling them what nonsense it all is ? " There 's more he told me , " the dean says , tensing his face . " Such as ? " " Oh , silly things . Did you two prepare for this interview ? He said his name was Davis , and that he 'd been in a battle with a cougar . Clearly , this is n't true . Do you have any insight into this ? " There is much more to tell : all the extravagant stories Trung apparently just gave the dean about his life , his white mother , his youth in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his interest in pottery , a girlfriend out in Port Townsend who shaves her head . Davis tries to picture the young boy 's face . Would he be gleefully reporting his false life ? Or would it be serious , the lies he never wanted to tell ? How fully , though , the dean seems to enjoy this retelling , and Davis recognizes the desperation of a man trapped in a winter room . So often the boys who come in here must report the dullness of their carefully conceived young lives . How often would this man come into contact with madness ? But as the dean , obviously a cocktail-party raconteur , goes into a giddy telling of Trung 's false vacation story in Yellowstone , Davis finds that he can easily imagine someone talking in this way about him , laughing about his theory of his " eye , " which he now cringingly realizes he has told too many people about , his job-hopping , his own brand of random opinion , which he yells at gatherings to get attention , the constant adoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoidances of reality , and , of course , the one woman last summer in braids . Davis even fooled himself that time . The fragrant smell of sandwich bread , mustard 's yellow acid , tongue smelling like tongue would taste on tongue . The dean and Davis share a handshake and a loud laugh as the interview ends , and Davis walks out knowing that soon in the mail Trung 's mother will find a white envelope , more than one surely , a thin one with a note politely stating how little room there is in their school , how well suited crazy , truthful Trung would be for some other place . Yes , this will happen soon enough . Around the corner he comes , down the hall of sepia boys in their pyramids of athleticism , grand and smiling , all with their gleaming futures bright in their eyes . What boys never made it into the gilt frames of this hallway ? What boys came and went without anyone noticing at all ? Davis enters the waiting room silently . The dean has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing he sees in the cinnamon-scented room is Trung , reading a magazine on outdoor sports . The boy wears his thick gray sweater , striped with red , and he looks overheated against the frosty windows . His left hand is propped awkwardly against his lips . It is the palm with the scab , and Trung is chewing it , picking flakes of blood between his teeth , touching them with his tongue , bringing them into his mouth and savoring them . Davis thinks , We eat ourselves alive . He remembers his friends in school , ugly or weak , chewing their nails , picking their noses , sucking at the blood of dormitory accidents , looking up with eyes that dared him to ask why , what they were doing , eating of themselves . The insect sound at night of nibbling , sleepless boys comforting themselves under the stamped sheets of their school , amid their sleeping rivals , taking these scraps for their hunger , grabbing this brief chance to tear at their awful shells , perhaps with dreams of rising like djinns from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even now the itch and hunger . He recognizes his own narrow indecisions and remakings , the new Davises his stepmother has patiently witnessed all these years , each failing to accomplish whatever was promised , doomed to be replaced . The product of this dull hopeas if each year that passes , he is less one being surviving than a series of rogue cannibal kings seizing a throne . Is this what everybody knows ? he wonders . Davis takes Trung 's hand from his mouth . The boy 's palm is bleeding in little gems of blood , and he looks up , not happy , not grinning in his lies , but solemn and staring , with both eyes and that still birthmark , staring in the same way as the first afternoon they met , in the steam of lemongrass and chicken fat , and the memory makes Davis salivate . " Let 's go , " he says , and Trung moves , unquestioning , out into the snow . The secretary asks something , but they 're gone , plastic bags left behind , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis sees the boy in his red hood staring again , meaning , What happens now ? And what does happen ? Do they climb the long way , one by one , up to the hotel to prepare for a sad phone call to the parents ? Do they wait for the bright golden snowplows to appear and save them from their dangling firelit cage on the hill ? What does a young man do with his ward , trapped and hungry in a snowstorm ? Does he lift him in his arms and run with him ? There they are , smaller from your viewpoint , hand in hand in the wilderness of the ice glare , their false selves clattering on their chests , the faint wind passing by them , through black tangled branches and tufts of rusty weeds , bringing the smell of smoke and mittens , of whiteness melting into whiteness , into their translucent room . And if you shook this room with giant hands , what would remain ?               @ @ @ @ @ @
