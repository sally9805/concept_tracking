" You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view ... until you climb in his skin and walk around in it . " To Kill a Mockingbird <p> My mother killed my marriage . Stomped all over it with her Pepto-Bismol pink pumps and ground it to divorce dust . <p> Okay , maybe that 's not entirely fair . Mom was n't solely responsible for the destruction of my marriage . Like many couples , Eric and I had some problems . But the biggest one was my mother . I turned the page in my wedding album on what would have been our five-year anniversary to a close-up of the two of us-happy , bright , shining , and in love . So in love . But that was then and this is now . <p> My fingers moved up the glossy page to the cleft in Eric 's jaw . I loved that Kirk Douglas cleft and had spent many happy hours kissing it . And the delicious lips above it . Now someone else was kissing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shoved it back into the closet , the phone rang . I walked over to the nightstand to check the caller ID . Probably a telemarketer . <p> As the phone continued to ring , I squinted at the name . Now where 'd I put my reading glasses ? By the time I finally found them , the answering machine had clicked on . <p> " Paige ? " My mother 's querulous voice filled the air . " Are you there ? Or are you out again ? Seems like you 're never home anymore . " She released a loud sigh . " I was hoping you could come over for just a minute and pull down my other quilt from the top of the linen closet . This one 's getting too hot and heavy . " She lobbed one of her famous guilt grenades . " Oh well , guess I 'll just have to make do . Talk to you soon . " <p> My turn to expel a loud sigh . <p> Mom 's " for just a minute " was never that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week since Dad died-she found " one other little thing " for me to do . " Since you 're here , would you mind bringing the new bag of cat litter in from the garage ? It 's too heavy for me . " <p> Translation : Clean out the dirty litter box and refill it . <p> " Could you look up the number to Animal Control ? I think I 've got raccoons or possums under the house . " <p> Translation : Call the County and take care of it . <p> " Would you run up to the store and pick up some chicken ? Breasts are on sale . Oh , and could you pick up a couple other things for me too ? " <p> Translation : Do all my grocery shopping . <p> Since Dad died nearly three years ago , I 'd become the go-to girl for anything and everything my mother needed . Mom was of the old school , accustomed to having my father handle everything , from balancing the checkbook to pumping gas , and had never really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of independence . And at her age , I did n't see that changing . <p> She also had the mind-set that family should do everything for one another , and considered it an imposition to ask for help from people who did n't share her same blood . Which meant everything fell on me . <p> My brother Patrick and sister Isabel had seen the writing on the wall and gotten out of our Sacramento hometown years ago . Patrick , the youngest , was a free spirit , going his own way and dabbling in different things . Last we 'd heard , he was living on an ashram somewhere in India . Staying in touch was n't exactly his thing . <p> As for Isabel , after getting her MBA from Berkeley , she 'd moved to Chicago to join an investment firm . There she 'd steadily risen up the ranks to the executive level where she was now a corporate muckety-muck in a high-rise office overlooking Michigan Avenue . Isabel , who 's two years older than me , is married to David , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perignon tastes . They work hard and play hard , flying all over the world to exotic vacation spots-beginning with their elopement to Barbados two years ago . <p> Mom still has n't forgiven her for that . " How could your sister go and get married without any of her family there ? " she 'd asked me . " A wedding is a celebration for the whole family-not just the two of them . " She released one of her signature sighs . " But then your sister 's always been selfish . I 'm glad I have at least one daughter who puts others before herself . I can always count on you , honey . " <p> No pressure there . <p> Do n't get me wrong . I love my mom . And I always try to honor her as the Bible says . But what about that Scripture that says " do not exasperate your children " ? <p> A siren split the air . Mom 's ringtone . <p> I knew if I answered my cell , she 'd wheedle me into stopping by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm thirty-five years old and I have n't learned how to say no to my mother . Grabbing my phone , I set it to vibrate and tossed it in my purse . Then I headed out the door , eager to meet the girls on our latest adventure . <p> Last year , at the start of our book club season , Becca , the founder of the club , had suggested that rather than just sitting around discussing the books we read , we start to live out some of the adventures in the books instead . And boy had we ever . We 'd gone sailing , camping , hiking , blind dating , even rafting down the river-courtesy of Huck Finn-but our biggest adventure came when we traveled to Paris to take cooking lessons after reading French Women Do n't Get Fat . <p> Ah , Paris . J'adore . We 'd all fallen head over heels for the beautiful , cosmopolitan city , but Chloe , my karaoke-singing pal who used to not have a daring bone in her body , had taken a sabbatical from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended stay . She was there even now , painting and living out her French adventure . <p> Not that I 'm jealous or anything . C'est la vie . <p> Last month for our April book club adventure , in honor of Kidnapped , where young David Balfour goes on the run through the Scottish Highlands , I took the girls to the annual Scottish Games and Gathering in a nearby town . I 'd have preferred Scotland-especially since I 'm part Scottish-but two trips to Europe in one year was n't in anyone 's budget . <p> We settled for Woodland . <p> There we had a blast watching the Highland dancers and pipers , tasting Scottish delicacies , and watching different athletic competitions including the hammer throw and haggis hurling . But our favorite event was checking out all the men in kilts . <p> Shades of Mel Gibson . Talk about freedom . <p> Today we were enjoying the freedom of a hike in the foothills north of Sacramento . <p> " This hill 's too high , " Kailyn whined . <p> " You think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becca said . " This is great practice for our Into Thin Air climb in a couple weeks . " <p> Annette , who 'd been steadily puffing alongside me for the past hour , sat down abruptly . " I need to rest , y'all . Is n't it about time for our picnic , anyway ? " <p> " Works for me . Hey guys , " I called to the rest of the group as I sank to the ground beside Annette , " time to eat . " Kailyn hotfooted it over to us but stopped short . She looked at her new white shorts and then down at the ground with a dubious expression . <p> Annette removed the denim overshirt she 'd tied around her waist and spread it out on the grass beside her a la Sir Walter Raleigh . " There you go , Queen Elizabeth . Now your royal designer shorts wo n't get ruined . " <p> " Thanks , Mom . You rock . " <p> " That I do , " Annette said . " Madonna has nothin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an estate in England . Although ... I used to live in England too . " <p> " On an estate ? " <p> " Nah . In an Air Force dorm when I was stationed there in the seventies . My roommates and I formed a girl band and played at weddings and bar mitzvahs . We really rocked those receptions . " She hummed a little " Bohemian Rhapsody " as she began removing food items from her backpack and setting them on a small tablecloth . <p> " Bunch of wusses , " Becca grumbled as she and Jenna joined us . " I do n't know how you ever expect to scale a mountain when you ca n't even make it up a little foothill . " <p> " I do n't expect to scale any mountains , " Annette said . " I 'll just watch you . " <p> " Ditto . " I smiled up at Becca . <p> " Aw c'm on , that 's not fair . The point of these adventures is for all of us to do them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures that all of us are physically capable of doing . " <p> " You tell her , Mom . " Kailyn stuck out her tongue at her risk-taking roommate . <p> " If we all trained together , we could get in shape to climb , " Jenna said . " We could work out together every morning . I could probably even get us a group rate at the gym . " <p> " No thanks , " Annette said . " I already do a morning workout every day with my husband . " <p> " Every day ? " Becca 's eyes gleamed beneath her dark spiky bangs . " Who says the sex drive wanes as you get older ? " <p> " Eww ! " Kailyn gave Becca a playful shove . " That 's my parents you 're talking about . " <p> " And this parent was talking about walking , not nookie . " <p> I faced Becca . " Ca n't we compromise on the mountain climbing ? You 've got a mixed group of women here and not all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I know ! " Kailyn 's blonde ponytail bobbed as she jumped up . " We could go to one of those indoor rock-climbing walls instead , with those rubber thingies where you put your feet . That does n't look too hard , plus we 'd be protected from the elements . " <p> " I 'm sure that 's just what Sir Edmund Hillary said when he was climbing Everest . ' Gee , let 's stay inside so we 're protected from the elements , ' " Becca said . <p> " Shut up , nature girl . " <p> I clapped my hands the way I used to when my siblings fought . " Time out . Hey , Jenna , are n't there less extreme mountains at Yosemite we could climb instead ? Say with some pretty waterfalls or something ? " <p> " Well , there 's Vernal Falls . Technically , it 's at the top of a mountain . " <p> " Yeah , with steps , " Becca said dismissively . <p> " Narrow steep steps cut into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Tess , and Chloe go up a bunch of narrow steps to look at the gargoyles in Notre Dame ? " <p> She nodded . <p> " Well , you can certainly do these steps then , " I said . " And so can I. Tess will too . Where is Tess today , anyway ? " <p> " She had a date with James . They were going to an exhibit at the DeYoung . " <p> " Nice . Blowing us off for a guy and art , " cynical Becca said . <p> Works for me . <p> " Not just any guy , " Annette said with a small , secret smile . " This is love . " <p> " Twoo wuv . " <p> " Mawwiage is what bwings us togevver today . " The Princess Bride is one of my favorite romantic movies . <p> " Does anyone else think it 's ironic that Tess 's last name is the same as his first name ? " <p> " No . I think it 's a God-thing , " Kailyn said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's just a coincidence . " <p> " A God-incidence , " Annette corrected her . <p> Becca rolled her eyes . " Here we go with the God-stuff again . " <p> Jenna and Becca were the two non-churchgoers in our group . Jenna never seemed bothered by our occasional God-mentions , but Becca was . I think it was something to do with her upbringing , but she 'd erected a clear No Trespassing sign on that part of her life . <p> " Well , I do n't know about y'all , " Annette said , changing the subject , " but I 'm really looking forward to when we read Maeve Binchy . " <p> " Me too . I love all her books . Especially Circle of Friends . " <p> " Ooh , I loved that movie . The guy who played Benny 's boyfriend was hot . " <p> " I did n't like the way it changed the ending from the book though . " <p> " Movies never get it right . Hemingway hated the Hollywood adaptations of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Did you ever see A Farewell to Arms with Rock Hudson ? Talk about overwrought . " <p> " Rabbit trail , guys . " Becca executed an exaggerated bucktoothed , rapid-chewing motion with her teeth and then fixed Annette with a stare . " What kind of adventure can we look forward to from a Maeve Binchy home-and-hearth saga ? " <p> " You 'll have to wait to find out . Patience is a virtue , you know . " <p> " Virtue is n't all it 's cracked up to be . " <p> A well-muscled pair of calves jogged into view and my heart did flip-flops . Those calves looked very familiar . What was Eric doing here ? <p> Only it was n't Eric . My heart began beating normally again as my eyes lifted to the blond surfer-dude body atop the muscular calves . Twice in a week would have been a bad sitcom . <p> Thursday when I was shopping at Whole Foods , I looked up from the mushrooms into Eric 's startled face . Could the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trickle of sweat escaped from my left armpit . <p> " Paige ... " <p> Then my right armpit betrayed me . I pressed both arms tightly against my sides before an entire sweat symphony broke out . <p> " Babe , did you get the portobellos ? " A very pregnant , yet tiny brunette waddled our way . Even her waddling was radiant . <p> Brat . Only that was n't the B word that flashed through my mind . <p> I stood there flushed and sweating like a pig in my Scottish Games T-shirt and old cut-offs while Eric 's model-perfect , gorgeous , and young second wife gave off a luminous pregnant-woman glow in her crisp white cotton sundress . <p> " Hi Heather , " I said in a bright , shiny voice as she drew near . " How 's it going ? " <p> " Paige . " Her fingers-a little bloated I was happy to see-took possession of Eric 's arm . " Good . And you ? " <p> " Great . Just doing a little shopping for my mom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't usually shop here , but I had a serious craving for portobello mushrooms and our grocery store was out . " <p> Eric shifted from one foot to the other . " So , uh , how is your mom these days ? " <p> " Okay . " <p> Like you care . You could n't stand my mother . I thought of all the fights we 'd had over her . Including the last one-a real doozy a few months after Dad died where Eric had shouted , " It 's me or your mom ! " <p> He was n't being fair . How could I turn my back on my mother ? She was getting old and did n't have anyone else to look after her , especially since Dad had died . It was my daughterly duty . Eric and I had our whole lives ahead of us . Who knew how long Mom had ? <p> Longer than us . <p> Eric walked out three weeks later . And less than a year later he was married to Heather . The beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The baby that I had wanted . I could n't take my eyes off Heather 's basketball stomach . <p> She tugged at his arm . " Honey , we really need to get going . " <p> " Oh , sure . " Eric bagged his portobellos at the speed of light . " Take it easy , Paige . " He gave me an uncomfortable smile . <p> " You too . " They walked away , Eric 's arm around Heather 's expectant waist . <p> The telltale monthly cramp brought me back to the present and reminded me that yet another one of my aging eggs was down the tube . Forever gone . One less chance for a baby . What 's a baby-wanting , good single Christian girl to do ? <p> I must have spoken the words aloud . <p> " You could go to a sperm bank , " Becca suggested . <p> " Huh ? " My mind shifted back to the picnic . <p> " A sperm bank . You know-the place where anonymous guys go and make deposits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear they have these portfolios and stuff so you can pick your kid 's genes . Like whether you want him or her to have some brilliant scientist with a PhD for a father , or a creative-artist type , or whatever . You get to choose . How cool is that ? " <p> " I 'd pick a professor-as long as he was n't too nerdy looking , " Jenna said . " That way my kid would be both smart and athletic . " <p> " I 'd probably go for a Bill Gates entrepreneur type so my kid would be rich and taken care of for life , " Kailyn said . <p> " And his dear old mother too ? " Annette teased her daughter . <p> " Of course . Paige , if you do decide to go the sperm bank route , you 'd better hurry up . I read an article in the doctor 's office that said a woman 's fertility starts decreasing in her early thirties and takes a big drop after age thirty-five . " <p> " I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a thirty-year-old woman has about a 20 percent chance each month of getting pregnant and by age 40 , that chance is only about 5 percent . " <p> " That sucks . " <p> " But what about all those celebrities having babies in their forties ? " <p> " They probably used donor eggs and spent big bucks on in-vitro . " Becca snorted . " They can afford it . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
