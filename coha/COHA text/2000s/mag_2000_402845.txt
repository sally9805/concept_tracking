Section : Regrets Want to hear about somebody else 's business regrets ? Seven Inc. 500 company founders tell all <p> Behind every successful CEO probably lurks at least one regret  --  the one strategic move he should have made earlier , the one project she should have bid for more aggressively , the one person he should never have hired . The best , or the luckiest , CEOs learn from their mistakes and get an opportunity to rectify them . But as we learned from the stories that company founders shared with us , even the ones who get a second chance can still feel the repercussions from their moves for years afterward . And the lessons they gleaned stay with them and influence their business decisions in sometimes surprising ways . Regret 1 : Being distracted by a buyout proposal <p> COMPANY : SmartDM ( #127 ) , in Nashville <p> BUSINESS : Direct marketing on- and offline <p> CEO : Richard Maradik <p> " IT WAS A CLASSIC STORY , " SAYS RICHARD Maradik . " It was a great offer . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Maradik and his partner , Jay Graves , had started was only two years old . It had just $1.8 million in sales and 10 employees , but already a large multinational company had come along , eager to take a large equity stake in the young business . The suitors promised growth capital , a guarantee of a working line of credit at the bank , and other much needed financial support . <p> The partners , exhausted after two years of 15-hour days and an uncertain future , were ecstatic . " I think every entrepreneur is lying if they say they 're not working toward an exit , " says Maradik . " We jumped at the term sheet . " That 's also when they began taking their eyes off the ball , he adds . <p> Caught up in the impending merger , " we began to assume we were part of them , " recalls Maradik . He and Graves attended corporate meetings and began to ready their systems for integration with those of the acquirer . They also went over the financials with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time looking at the books , " says Maradik , " but not at the business . " <p> As the merger talks dragged on , the partners began to neglect their core business . " We ignored sales , we ignored margin , we ignored cash flow  --  because we assumed the deal would go through , " says Maradik . " We spent too much time working on the deal we thought was going to happen . It almost killed us . " <p> Before the partners knew it , they were in the hole for almost $200,000 and were having difficulty making payroll . At the 11th hour , when Maradik and Graves thought they were about to sign on the dotted line , the suitor changed the terms of the agreement . Suddenly , Maradik says , " they wanted to buy us out entirely . We 'd be just employees . We were in a weakened position . They knew it . We knew it . We had two choices : we could fight or we could cave . " <p> The two men took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the drawing board . They tapped their already drawn-down savings accounts and took no salaries for six months . This time around they were determined to do things right . " Exercising all my humility , " Maradik says , " I 'll admit we were running the business wrong , " even before the brush with the acquirer . He was 25 when he started the company ; his partner was 23 . " We did n't really know anything about P &Ls,; cash management , balance sheets , " says Maradik . " We did n't know how a valuation was done . " <p> After their near-death experience , " we gained a healthy respect for the numbers , " he says . " We put in internal controls and clearer goals to profitability . We 're always monitoring our numbers to spot trouble . " <p> Clearly , the partners are doing something right now . This year the company , which has branch offices in Atlanta and Las Vegas and employs some 40 people , will have revenues of more than $9 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital and are on the cusp of a second round of financing . <p> " We really learned what drives the value of the company , " says Maradik . " It was a bittersweet lesson . " Regret 2 : Not seeking financing sooner <p> COMPANY : Granite Systems ( #77 ) , in Manchester , N.H. <p> BUSINESS : Designing software products for the telecommunications industry <p> CEO : John Borden <p> " I REGRET NOT HAVING STEPPED ON THE accelerator a little earlier , " says CEO John Borden . He started Granite Systems in 1993 as a consulting group , after having served as a consultant with the Boston-based Yankee Group during AT &T's; divestiture . But about two years later , when the opportunity came along to develop and sell a new software product , his customers offered to give him funding for it . Borden then got so absorbed in running the business that he just never got around to looking for any further financing . <p> Borden and his chief technology officer were managing everything . " We were very caught up with solving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing well . There 's only so much that two people can do , " he says . " But then we stepped back and realized that we had to make the choice between having a lifestyle company or really growing the company . " <p> At that point Borden was financing the company solely with operating cash . And although he is sorry he did n't seek investment funds sooner , he says the emphasis on cash flow " gave us healthy habits " and a workable business model . " By year three or four , we probably could 've been ready to go out and do a first round , " he says . But he waited until October 1998 , when the company raised $2 million . " If we had gotten money sooner , we would 've been able to set up a sales and marketing operation and develop a diversified product line , " Borden says . And indeed , as soon as he got the first round of financing , he brought in a solid management team , focusing on sales and marketing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> This year Granite Systems has attracted nearly $23 million in a second round of financing and has 96 employees , up from 25 in 1998 . And despite the pride Borden feels about his company 's self-sufficient early years , he is more confident now . " I do n't lose as much sleep at night over meeting payroll , " he says . Regret 3 : Not trying to go public sooner <p> COMPANY : TelStrat International ( #232 ) , in Plano , Texas <p> BUSINESS : Adding remote capabilities to telecommunications systems <p> CEO : Bob Carroll <p> BOB CARROLL IS AN ENTREPRENEUR WHO values his independence . The CEO of TelStrat , who had years of experience in engineering and management and another start-up under his belt , was determined to keep the business in the family . In 1993 he 'd " started it as a private company , " he says , " and I wanted to keep it that way . I wanted the autonomy . " <p> He brought his two adult children into the business two years later and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them take over . " But within the past six months , all that has changed . " With all the dot-com competition , it 's hard to motivate and retain good talent , " says the 56-year-old Carroll . " They 've got stars in their eyes about stock options . " So he now has to switch directions and head for the public markets . " If I had decided to do this from the start , it would have been easier , " he says . <p> Carroll has been working almost exclusively with one customer , telecommunications giant Nortel , in designing , manufacturing , and private-labeling added capabilities for the company 's systems , but he now feels he must expand his customer base . That will cost him in terms of profitability because of the investment he must now make in marketing , and in research and development for individual customers . <p> Mostly , though , he feels he may have missed the best initial-public-offering market for a long time to come . " Had I positioned myself to go public , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . I missed a great window , " says Carroll . " We had a 200% growth rate , and we had a lot of cash . All I really needed to do was to have a good story . It would 've been an easy sell . " Instead , he now plans to go public in two or three years , depending on what the market looks like when he 's ready . <p> So why did n't Carroll go public when he could have ? " I had been part of public companies before and knew the pains you have to go through . I was n't willing to make the trade-offs , " he says . In 1987 he had started another business , Digital Techniques Inc. , which became part of a public company . " I had the experience of dealing with shareholders , with a board . I had enough of that . Now I 'm chairman of TelStrat . For a while I was the only officer . Then I added my kids and my president . And that 's it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says wistfully . Regret 4 : Not going to college <p> COMPANY : Ecocrete ( #154 ) , in Chula Vista , Calif . <p> BUSINESS : Manufacturing modular schools and classrooms <p> CEO : Keith Christian <p> " I DID N'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION IN HIGH school , " Keith Christian says ruefully . " My pager kept going off . " That 's because he had started his first company , a janitorial-services business , when he was 15 . He managed to graduate , albeit with poor grades , but his business was doing so well that he never bothered with college . And now , years later , despite having started three successful companies , " I think I would be a better CEO if I had more education , " he says . He feels that lack of education most acutely in the areas of finance and accounting , where he has to rely on his employees to monitor the bottom line . <p> In his 41 years , Christian has never worked for anyone . Now that Ecocrete  --  which owns a patented formula for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old and has some 300 employees , he wishes he had had a role model earlier in his life . " I wish I had worked for a more mature company that had a backlog and inventory . I wish I had worked for a company that got it right , " he says . " I could have learned how to manage a business . In a start-up , you 're always in crisis mode . " <p> As part of the consolidation in his industry , Christian is acquiring a dealership that has been the intermediary between Ecocrete and its customers , the school districts . With expansion on his mind and recognizing his own limitations , he has decided to make the head of the dealership , Richard Koch , his new CEO . The strikingly modest Christian believes that Koch  --  who has 15 years ' experience in the business and a degree in accounting from the University of California , Berkeley  --  " will make a better CEO . " <p> Despite his regrets , Christian , who will remain chairman , says he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he is strongly encouraging his two kids to stick it out . And it 's perhaps only fitting that he is finally hitting his stride in a business devoted to building space for students . Regret 5 : Hiring the wrong executive <p> COMPANY : Alogent Corp . ( #281 ) , in Norcross , Ga . <p> BUSINESS : Designing and installing payment-processing software <p> CEO : Brian Geisel <p> " IT WAS A DESPERATION MOVE , " SAYS BRIAN Geisel , referring to his decision to hire a key manager . The fact that the man he chose was a bad fit was one thing , but what Geisel regrets most is that he 'd allowed himself to get backed into a corner in the first place . " My biggest mistake was to let myself get into a situation where you need to solve issues immediately , in desperation , " says Geisel , who founded his software company in 1995 . " I did n't have the resources to let me do due diligence . I did n't have a board . I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of management to use the managers as a sounding board . " <p> As a result , Geisel hired someone without thoroughly checking his background and references . " And boy , did I pay for it , " he admits . " There 's a tremendous investment of time and effort to bring somebody to a level where they can add value . " It took a year before Geisel finally realized that this new hire was not the right man for the job . He was " unable to handle the complexities of dealing with large projects and large clients , " the CEO says . <p> At the time Geisel , whose background was in information technology , did n't have any real experience as a manager . He was looking for a senior executive who would have the sales and organizational management experience to complement his own skills . " I was looking for balance , " he says . " I got that , but there was no overlap . " In terms of skills , style , and strategic goals , Geisel says , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . " The executive left the company by mutual agreement . <p> Now , with 52 employees and a stronger management team , Geisel uses an outside agency to screen potential senior hires . And he has learned to rely on advisers for input on candidates as well . In retrospect , he can easily see how his management style led to problems with his first big hire . " I 've always kind of carried things on my own back , " he says . His company remains 100% employee owned , without any outside investors . Regret 6 : Not hiring an in-house recruiter <p> COMPANY : T2 Systems ( #394 ) , in Avon , Ind . <p> BUSINESS : Designing software that tracks parking tickets <p> CEO : Mike Simmons <p> FOR THE FIRST FOUR YEARS AFTER ITS founding , T2 Systems doubled its revenues every year . In 1998 , however , its growth reached critical mass , and CEO Mike Simmons found himself needing to double the number of employees , which then stood at 12 . Lacking any kind of human-resources department and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Simmons charged his three managers ( and himself ) with recruiting their own workforce . It was , he admits , a costly mistake . <p> " There were not enough people to do all the work there was , " recalls Simmons . The recruiting process made matters worse because , he says , " it took the managers out of the work process . " Instead , they were busy screening rsums , checking references , and traveling around the country to find qualified employees in the company 's high-tech niche . " The talent pool for us is very small , " Simmons explains . The ideal potential employee needs to know software plus the principles of the parking business . <p> Simmons did use several professional recruiters , who , for a total of $50,000 to $60,000 in fees , yielded only two or three hires . He realized he could have hired a full-time recruiter for that amount and gotten more bang for the buck . Finally , last year , he did just that , tapping one of the few outside recruiters who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spent a year hiring 12 people , the recruiter was able to match that number in about seven months . The company now has 44 employees . As soon as he had hired a recruiting manager , " our sales went up , our customer service went up , and our hiring became more efficient , " says Simmons . " Most of all we had suffered because of the burnout factor for managers . " <p> The recruiter , at his own request , has since moved over to a sales position . Simmons is going out for a round of additional funding and promises that one of his first hires after he gets that money will be a new in-house recruiter . Regret 7 : Charging too little for too long <p> COMPANY : Synergy Investment ( #219 ) , in Framingham , Mass . <p> BUSINESS : Designing and retrofitting energy-efficient lighting systems <p> CEO : Daniel Gould <p> Daniel Gould went into the lighting business on his own in 1994 , when he was all of 25 , and created a niche for himself with few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hustling , offering his customers what he calls " the Wal-Mart attitude : give them rock-bottom prices all the time . " But at the end of the day , he says , " I did n't have much to show for it . Basically , I was giving it away . " <p> He also found that he would give his customers estimates up front , and even if he found the work more time-consuming or more expensive than he had expected , he did n't adjust his fees accordingly . " I had to figure out how to tell them I had to charge them more , " says Gould . And that was something he was loath to do , because he both wanted to honor his commitments and feared losing customers . <p> As he gained more experience and more regular customers , he began to get a sense of the true market value of his work , which is a highly specialized combination of consulting and contracting . He realized , belatedly , that " I could 've charged more , and people would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually behind the curve for pricing compared with the market , " though he has gradually raised his prices over the past few years . He remains " the low-cost provider , " he says . " When I started the business , I was happy just to draw a salary , " he explains . " It 's been a slow awakening to what I needed to charge to be slightly profitable by the end of the year .
