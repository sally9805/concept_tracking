Brady Drops the Ball <br> Yeah , I guess I am almost too good to be true , I thought as I read the SPORTS : The Magazine cover story for the third time . That is , if you believe the hype . But the truth is I almost ruined my life one night , but I somehow managed to right a wrong and come out basically unscathed . <br> It was a cool October night and my football team , the Central Georgia University Jaguars , had just recorded our biggest victory in CGU school history over the Louisiana State University ( LSU ) Tigers . It was a beautiful night for football , with a crowd of over 80,000 fans . I remember the smell of the grass and how great my teammates and I looked in our green and gold uniforms under the lights in a nighttime atmosphere that only college football can provide . It was an incredible feeling when the team raced from the tunnel to the field surrounded by a thunderous roar from the CGU fans . <br> I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained over 150 yards against a tough LSU defense . <br> After the game , I decided to join my childhood best friend , Delmar , and some of my teammates for some postgame festivities . In the past , for me that would have meant reviewing film of that night 's game . But I was getting tired of all my teammates ribbing me and saying , " Brady ca n't hang " and " Brady ai n't down with that , " so I surprised them and myself by going to drink my first beer with them at senior Teddy Miles 's apartment . <br> After a couple of beers , I decided to call it a night and trek back to campus on foot . When I got to the parking lot of Teddy 's apartment building , I saw a girl getting out of a car in a white dress and white stockings . When the headlights hit her face , I realized I knew her . Naomi Brasswell . A girl from the church I attend in Scarlet Springs . <br> Naomi was one of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saving Ourselves when I tried to start the group at the church , but she was the only one who showed up for the first meeting . So I gave up the idea of starting the celibacy club , but still talked with Naomi several times about how tough it was playing football and trying to stay celibate . <br> Naomi was a local girl , was majoring in nursing at CGU , and lived with her mother and little sister near campus . Sometimes we attended Bible study on Wednesday nights and went to the movies on Sunday after church . A couple of times she invited me to her house for Sunday dinner . I always accepted that invitation , because her mother could throw down with the pots and pans . <br> I liked Naomi a lot , but I was trying to follow my mother 's advice and stay focused on football and my studies . Still , I thought my mother might like Naomi because she was a virgin and went to church three times a week . <br> I approached Naomi , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed a beautiful smile and said , " Oh , it 's you , Brady . What are you doing over here ? " <br> " Hanging with some teammates , celebrating the big win , " I said . " What are you doing ? " <br> " Apartment-sitting for one of my friends who went home this weekend , " she said . <br> " What apartment does she live in ? " I asked . <br> " Up there , " Naomi said as she pointed toward an apartment on the third floor , almost directly over my teammate 's place . <br> " Why do n't I walk you up ? Make sure nobody messes with you , " I said , realizing that several of my teammates were now most likely drunk and ready to hit the prowl . <br> " That would be nice , " Naomi said as she locked her car door . As we walked toward the apartment , I took notice of her beautiful bright eyes and black hair tumbling over her shoulders . The evening light accentuated her white uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexy , naughty nurse and not the church girl I was used to . <br> When we got to the apartment , I realized I was a little tipsy , so I asked Naomi if I could come in for a while , get some water and rest . She said yes , and minutes later I crashed on the sofa and fell asleep . <br> A couple hours later , I woke up and Naomi was standing in front of me holding a bottle of water and wearing an oversized white T-shirt with no bra . I could see the shadow of her nipples pushing into the cotton , the soft , heavy curves of her breasts standing out perkily in front of her . An image flashed through my head of me raising up her shirt , getting on my knees , and sucking those breasts . I felt a twinge in my jeans , but I tried to ignore it . <br> " I thought you might need this , " she said as she handed me the water , leaning toward me as her overpowering but welcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply , wondering what her skin would taste like . <br> I took a sip of water , then put the bottle on the floor , stood up , and just looked at her . She stared back . I was nervous , and the bulge in my jeans grew tighter . <br> " Would it be all right if I kissed you ? " I asked . <br> " Yes , " she whispered . <br> I leaned in , put my arms around her waist , and pressed my lips softly against hers . They were sweet , like I always thought they would be . <br> Her body was tense at first , but then I parted her lips , slid my tongue into her mouth . She closed her lips around my tongue , and a shiver ran through my body . <br> I leaned out of the kiss . " Where 's the bedroom ? " <br> " Back there , " Naomi said , pointing behind her . " What about your celibacy vow ? " she asked . <br> I thought about the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to go all the way . " <br> " Are you sure ? " <br> " We can just . . . you know . . . dry grind . " <br> " Okay . I think that 'll be okay . " <br> I followed Naomi into the dark room . It took my eyes a minute to adjust before I saw that there was n't a bed , just a mattress on the floor , a flower-print bedspread over it . <br> " What should we do first ? " Naomi said . <br> " Take off your clothes , " I said . <br> " No . You go first . " <br> " Let 's do it together . " <br> We slowly took off our clothes . I pulled off my sweater and she pulled her T-shirt over her head . I pushed down my jeans . I took off my boxer briefs , and she slid off her ivory panties . <br> Naomi lay across the mattress on her back . <br> I stood over her , my erection sticking out and slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Naomi said . <br> " It 's not that big , " I said . <br> " It looks so big and hard , " Naomi said , gently touching the tip . <br> I moaned , " You got me so brick , girl . " <br> I lowered my body onto hers . Her skin was soft , her hips wide ; her nipples , pointing up , were thick and hard like ripe cherries . Her body seemed to cradle mine as I lay fully on top of her . <br> " I 'm nervous , Brady . " <br> " I know . Me , too , " I said . <br> " I 'm so wet , Brady . Do you want to feel me ? " <br> " Yeah . " <br> She took my penis in her hand , rubbed it softly over her vagina . <br> I moaned . <br> " Do you feel it ? " She moaned , too . <br> " Yeah . " <br> " Does it feel good ? " <br> " Yeah , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " We ca n't do anything . We do n't have protection . " <br> " I know . We are n't going all the way , " I said sincerely . But it was feeling so good , better than I ever thought it would . The tip of me was throbbing , pulsating . I started to glide in and out in short strokes . Then I went a little deeper with each one , and I felt like I was losing control . <br> " Brady , maybe we should stop , " Naomi said . <br> " I 'm sorry ! " I said , pulling out . " I 'm sorry . We can stop . " <br> Naomi looked up at me , her thighs still open , her eyelids low . She looked so beautiful right then . <br> " I . . . I . . . do n't want you to stop . I like the way it feels , " Naomi stammered . <br> " Are you sure ? " <br> Naomi did n't say anything , just nodded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making my head spin . Then she put my tip back inside of her and said , " Do n't push too hard and do n't come inside me . " <br> " Okay , " I said , already starting slowly to grind on top of her . I moaned , and I heard her , too . She wrapped her arms around me , clawing my back . <br> " Oh , Brady , " she whispered . <br> And then I started to feel what I never felt before . Like an impending explosion , racing through my body toward my groin . My muscles tightened , my head spinning . " I . . . I . . . " <br> It was too much . I could n't handle it . And before I knew it , I was gripped so tightly by a pleasure so overwhelming that I could n't move . My back arched , I cried out and pushed farther into Naomi and then started to explode while I tried to pull out . But I could n't . I rolled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and I did n't even last two minutes . <br> All I could think about was how much better this was than my palms and Palmer 's cocoa butter lotion . <br> A cloud of guilt followed both of us during the weeks that followed . I thought how disappointed my mother would be , but I could n't forget how off the chain the sex had felt , and I now knew why sex was all my teammates thought or talked about . I called Naomi a couple of times , but our conversations were weird , like we knew that we both wanted to do it again but we could n't live with the remorse . <br> At the end of the season , Naomi called me and said she needed to see me . It sounded like she was crying , and when I asked her what was wrong she asked me to meet her in the reading room at the school 's <br> library . <br> When I got there , I saw Naomi dressed in a green sweater and blue jeans , looking beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naomi whispered , " I 'm pregnant . " <br> For minutes I maintained a stony silence before finally muttering to myself , " Damn , son . " <br> In the days that followed , I spent long hours in my apartment thinking about God and how pissed off at me He must be . Still , that would be nothing compared to my mother 's disappointment and sadness . <br> I spent a lot of time praying . I spent a lot of time telling myself that I was n't ready to be a father . The one thing my mother had warned me about , I 'd gone out and done . Even though she did n't talk a lot about my father , she 'd admitted that they were both too young when I was conceived . <br> I chastised myself for ever thinking I was better than my friends and some of my teammates because I wore a celibacy ring . <br> I thought about how this was going to affect something that I truly loved  --  playing football , which had always been a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my #2 jersey . Even though my mom was n't in favor of my playing at first , I convinced her at age six that it was a part of my DNA . Something I had to do to feel whole . I remember putting on a helmet for the first time when I was playing Pee Wee football and how it made me feel important . I remember the first time I touched a football on a kickoff return and how I outraced all of the other guys for a touchdown . <br> Maybe God answers prayers after He gets your attention . A day before finals started , Naomi came to my apartment and told me she decided to get an abortion and transfer to Savannah State , but that she would need my help . <br> I did n't know how I felt about abortion , but I definitely did not want to become another statistic , a young African American man who 'd become a father before he escaped his teens . I made a promise that if I could come out of this situation free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only God , Naomi , and I would know what I 'd done . <br> From the Trade Paperback edition . <br> Continues ...
