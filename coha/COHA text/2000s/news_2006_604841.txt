<p> NEW YORK  --  Depending on which Wall Street prognosticator you listen to , the stock market in 2006 could deliver fat 20% gains , suffer a drop of 10% or end up somewhere in between . <p> On average , the benchmark Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index is forecast to end 2006 around 1350 , which equates to a gain of about 8% , according to a dozen strategists polled by USA TODAY . After a ho-hum 3% gain last year , the gap between the calls made by the most optimistic bull and the most pessimistic bear is as wide as it has been in years . <p> This year 's most bullish prediction comes from Ed Keon of Prudential Equity Group . His year-end target for the S &P; 500 is 1530 , which not only translates into a 20%-plus gain but would also be an all-time high . <p> On the other end of the continuum is JPMorgan Chase 's Abhijit Chakrabortti , who predicts the S &P; 500 will fall to 1125 in 2006 , a drop of 10% . <p> Stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , which would mark the longest winning streak since the late 1990s . Where Wall Street 's top gurus thinks stocks are headed this year : <p> Bullish : 1530 Market call : +22.6% Ed Keon Prudential Equity Group Ed Keon is not just bullish on stocks , he is really , really bullish . His 2006 year-end target for the S &P; 500 is 1530 . That 's a bold prediction , considering the benchmark index closed 2005 at 1248 . But if Prudential 's chief investment strategist is right , it would mark : <p> *A record high for the S &P,; eclipsing the current peak of 1527.46 reached on March 24 , 2000 , and fully erasing the 49.1% loss suffered in the brutal 2000-02 bear market . <p> *The first 20%-plus annual gain since 2003 . <p> *A major leg up to the current bull that kicked off in October 2002 . <p> *An end to a two-year streak of underwhelming single-digit gains . <p> It 's a " valuation " call , Keon says . Unlike 2004 and 2005 , when price-to-earnings ratios , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock market 's " multiple " to start expanding again in 2006 . That means investors will pay more for a company 's earnings stream . <p> So-called P-E expansion was common in the late 1990s , accounting for a large part of the outsize gains . <p> " For the last couple of years , with the exception of U.S. stocks , the valuation of financial assets ranging from real estate to bonds , and gold to foreign equities have been rising , " Keon says . " The big surprise in ' 06 will be that stock valuations rise rather than fall . " <p> For this optimistic scenario to play out , inflation must drop substantially , Keon says . That 's possible , given his belief that sky-high energy prices , which have been exacerbating inflation , will adjust downward . <p> Keon is also confident that mom-and-pop investors will regain their confidence in stocks and start allocating more of their investment dollars to the stock market , which should boost demand and prices . Despite three up years in a row , flows to U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to change  --  " 25% of ( last ) year 's flows into large-cap mutual funds happened in the past couple of weeks , " Keon says . <p> His moneymakers : " Own stuff that will go up fastest if the market takes off , " Keon says . <p> *Consumer discretionary stocks . <p> *Financial stocks . <p> *Tech and telecom names . <p> The 1400s Club Tobias Levkovich Citigroup Market call : +12.2% Investors feeling blue might be underestimating upside , Levkovich says .

" Investors are worried about earnings , due to worries ranging from high oil prices to rising interest rates , and from housing bubbles to an avian flu pandemic .
