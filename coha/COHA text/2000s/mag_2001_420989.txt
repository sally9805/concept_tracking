In what promises to be one of the biggest seasons for little men , the unique abilities of these point guards will drive their teams and their sport // Keep your eye on the ball . Those six words are all it takes to answer this question that has lingered around college basketball since last spring , when seemingly every prep big man who ever has dunked gave college a no-look pass : What do we do now ? Keep your eye on the ball . If you want to know what there is to get excited about , check out the guys who have the ball the most-when it matters most-because this year 's crop of point guards is as good as it gets . What makes this group so special is its ability to master the skills that define the position . Here we focus on the five players who excel at the most critical skills of the trade : scoring , ballhandling , defending , shooting and passing . Picking the player who epitomizes each skill proved challenging  --  and caused great debate  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him passionately dissect his craft , our confidence is high that ... * The best scorer is Duke 's Jason Wil  --  liams , who offers an analysis of his of  --  fensive repertoire that has to be chilling to anyone trying to check him this season : " When I got to Duke , I was pretty much either going to shoot a long jumper or drive to the basket . But now , I am adding another dimension to my game , a midrange jumper . That will allow me to mix things up more . " * The best ballhandler is Florida 's Brett Nelson , who despite some anticipated time at shooting guard will continue to work his magic . " Even if I 'm at the 2 guard , " Nelson says , " the point guard is going to advance it to me anyway and I 'll go with it . I 'm still going to have the ball in my hands no matter where I play . " * The best defender is Providence 's John Linehan , a 5-9 blur who often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's jersey . * The best shooter is Gonzaga 's Dan Dickau , who , during a photo shoot after a late-October practice , missed his first 3-point attempt and knocked down the next 17. * The best passer is St. Joseph 's Jameer Nelson , who likens setting up his highpowered Hawks teammates to finding open receivers from his days as the quarterback at Chester ( Pa . ) High School . One final note : Do n't lament what the college game lost to the NBA . Ir celebrate what it still has . For start five guys who are n't that big bu are the best at what they do . Well , that 's what we think . Here 's what they think . Top five scorers 1 Jason Williams , Duke . He 's as good a backcourt scorer as college basketball has seen in years . He broke Duke 's 50-year-old , single  --  season scoring mark with 841 points last season . 2 Troy Bell , Boston College . He led the 27-5 Eagles in scoring 25 times , then scored a team-high 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last summer . BC 's hopes rest on his quick return from minor knee surgery October 31. 3 Lynn Greer , TempIe . He scored 20 or more points in 13 games , including eight of the team 's final 10 . He led the nation in minutes and the team in assists , steals , free-throw attempts and free-throw percentage . 4 Roger Mason , Virginia . The early reports are that he 's adapting nicely to his new point guard position . He improved his deep shooting dramatically last season and will be a load for any team that tries to check him with a small guard . 5 Jerry Green , UC Irvine . The best point guard you 've never heard of was named the Big West 's Player of the Year after leading the Anteaters in scoring ( 19 ppg ) for the third consecutive season . JASON WILLIAMS School : Duke Year : Junior Ht. /Wt. : : 6-2/196 Hometown : Plainfield , N.J. Williams on scoring When I was a little kid , I 'd imagine that I was playing against Michael Jordan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be like , " Oh , he 's still there ! " And I 'd have to do another move to score the basket . It 's the same thing that I do now . I like to work out by myself , and I 'll be walking to the gym and I 'll just make up a name and say , " OK , today I 'm playing against this John Doe , and he 's considered the best defensive player in college basketball . His main goal is to not let me score this game " Then I 'll go out and I 'll do weird things , like I 'll throw the ball up in the air and make some moves without the ball , or I 'll act like I 'm calling for a curl , or I 'll pick the ball up off the ground and hit a jump shot or drive and do a spin move and hit a layup , all while I 'm imagining that my every move is being countered . You do n't really realize it until after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody , but you beat somebody in your mind . When I make a move in real life and the defender does n't counter that move , I 'll be like , " Whoa ... he did n't even counter my move " Because I always imagine someone countering my moves defensively , and then when they do n't counter it , it 's easier . I am a little surprised sometimes when I see a stat sheet after a game . I do n't pride my game on how many points I score . The biggest thing for me is whether we win . Sometimes , one of the guys will be like , " J. , you scored 19 points straight , " and I will be like , " What ? No way . " It 's something you never think about , it just happens . BEST BALLHANDLER : BRETT NELSON School : Florida Year : Junior Photograph // Ht. /Wt. : 6-3/182 Hometown : St. Albans , W. Va . Nelson on ballhandling Ballhandling means everything . It 's a really important tool . It feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands off the dribble as it does when I 'm catching and shooting it . The ball feels like part of my hand , really . When I was growing up , everywhere I 'd go , I 'd be carrying a basketball . I 'd be dribbling while walking down the street or when I was with my buddies . Wherever I was , I 'd always have a ball . I have always had a knack for handling the ball . I 've worked on it for as long as I can remember . I always did a lot of ballhandling drills growing up-full-court dribbling moves , inside-out , crossover , behind the back , between the legs , figure-eight dribbles , spider drillsand I think that 's why I can handle the ball so well today . I really do n't have a favorite move . I pretty much do whatever is instinctive . I use my dribble to set up my own shot , especially coming off pick-and-rolls . One of the best things to do is to hesitate , and if a guy goes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dribble and then pull up . If he does n't go for it , act like you are going to hesitate again , then just shoot Or a lot of times , I like to go at a guy as hard as I can with the dribble and get him backing up , and then pull up for a jumper . It feels good when you can break down a defense with your dribble . Top five ballhandlers 1 Brett Nelson , Florida . He will play some shooting guard , but the Gator who brings the ball up the court will funnel it to Nelson right away to take advantage of his ball skills . 2 Frank Williams , Illinois . Couple his ballhandling with his unbelievable power for a point , and Williams can be close to unstoppable on his drives to the hoop. 3 Jason Williams , Duke . Of all of the things in Williams ' rich repertoire , his crossover might be the most stunning . 4 T.J. Ford , Texas . The " Horns are lacking a point guard no more . This kid single-handedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 5 Andre Barrett , Seton Hall . His ability to dart through traffic and weave around the court is difficult to stop given his great quickness and the way he treats the ball with care . BEST DEFENDER JOHN LINEHAN School : Providence Year : Senior Photograph // Ht. /Wt. : 5-9/165 Hometown : Chester , Pa . Linehan on defense When I was in the Ioth grade , the importance of defense sunk in . I was starting to see guys going to big schools , and I was n't really getting recruited . I knew I was being overlooked because of my size , but I knew defense would get me noticed . Coaches like defense , especially coach ( Tim ) Welsh . Some people say my size is a disadvantage , but I use it as an advantage because I am so low to the ground and I can move well laterally . When bigger guys are trying to bring the ball up the court , they have to worry about me poking at the ball and being all over them when they are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not a weakling ; I can hold my own . Plus , if they try to post me up , that takes them out of their game . It 's a great feeling to hold someone under their normal production-a guy who usually gets 18 points a game and then he gets six or eight . If you 've won the game , then you know that a big part of it is because of you . Quickness . Anticipation . Being smart . Those are the three biggest things that go into playing good defense . I definitely am a student of the game . I watch a lot of players , a lot of tape of guys . I watch what the point guard likes to do , some of the moves he may like . I like to see if he has a weak hand . I usually guard whoever brings the ball up . A lot of times , teams will take their point guard off the ball so he does n't have to go against me . That makes me feel good . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows people respect my game and the way I play . Top five defenders 1 John Linehan , Providence . College basketball 's ultimate pest uses his unparalleled quickness to attach himself to his man . He ranked fourth in the NCAA with 3.12 steals per game last season . 2 Steve Blake , Maryland . Duke 's Jason Williams , a 47.3 percent shooter last season , shot 36.6 percent against the Terps in four games . Blake 's defense was the reason . Chris Duhon , Duke . His ability to clamp down on opposing point guards frees the defensively challenged Williams to worry about offense. 4 Kevin Braswell , Georgetown . He 's overshadowed in the Big East by Linehan , but know this : Braswell already is the career steals leader at a school with a pretty fair defensive tradition . 5 Hollis Price , Oklahoma . Coach Kelvin Sampson demands good perimeter defense , which is why Price is one of his favorites . Price recorded three or more steals 10 times last season . BEST SHOOTER : DAN DICKAU school : Gonzaga Photograph Photograph // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wash . Dickau on shooting A lot of players say they like to shoot a thousand shots a day . To me , that 's a lot of crap . First of all , you 'd be in the gym a long time . Second of all , there 's no way you 're going to take each shot as seriously as you should . I try to get to the gym once a day to work on my own . I 'll pick something that I want to work on , whether it 's coming off a ball screen , shooting one-dribble pull-ups or just doing catch-and-shoots . Then I 'll take each shot as seriously as I can in game speed and in game situations . Some people shoot directly off their right shoulder , some directly in front of their face . My release is barely above my head and slightly to the right . When my shot does n't feel good , I generally think it 's flat . I 'll move in a little closer to get that rhythm going and make sure I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and straight down and not floating back . My favorite place shot is the straightaway 3 . To me , that 's still a free throw because you are perfectly lined up . Whenever you are shooting for " next " in a pickup game , that 's usually where you shoot it from . That 's the shot I 've taken more than any other . Coach ( Mark ) Few talks to me about this a lot : Maybe you do n't make your first couple of 3s , but you have to find a way to get yourself in a rhythm , whether that 's getting a layup or getting to the free-throw line . Sometimes , you just need to see the ball going through the basket . Getting into a zone is a great feeling . You look for the slightest bit of an opening because your confidence is rolling . Shooting really is all in your head . If you think it 's going to go in and you shoot it with confidence , then it 's going to go in . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gonzaga . He made 48 percent of his 3-point attempts last season , including 52.4 percent in three NCAA Tournament games . He scored 31 points in one half against Santa Clara . 2 Brett Nelson , Florida . He has great range and is dangerous all around the arc . He made four of his first 25 3-point attempts last year , then made half of his next 154 tries . 3 Jason Williams , Duke . Defenders who are so scared he will blow past them get burned when he pulls up and launches from 24 feet . 4 Steve Logan , Cincinnati . A move to the point could affect his bottom line , but with his ability to knock down shots and feast at the free-throw line , the dropoff should n't be too significant . 5 Tony Akins , Georgia Tech . The best shooter under 6-0 . Only Williams had a higher 3-point percentage among players returning to the ACC . BEST PASSER : JAMEER NELSON School : St. Joseph 's Year . Sophomore Ht. /Wt. : 6-0/190 Hometown : Chester , Pa . Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , and I think part of that is because I was a high school quarterback in football . There are a lot of similarities between being back in the pocket and being on the court running an offense . Just like a quarterback , a point guard needs to see what 's in front of him and read the defense and know what his teammates are going to do and figure out the best option . The No. 1 thing you have to have in order to be a good passer is court awareness . You have to know where your teammates are on the floor and where they like to get the ball and who can do what with the ball where . You do n't want to pass the ball to your big guys on the wing unless you are in trouble and you are going to go and get the ball right back . I like passing better than scoring . I like making the pass that leads to the layup or the dunk-specially the dunk-that gets the crowd going . Knowing that I made that pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kidd 's game because he was also a pass-first , shoot-second point guard . I liked the way he would work the floor and get his teammates involved and make everyone around him better . That 's the kind of point guard I try to be . I can do the flashy pass as well as the fundamental , but there 's no need to do the flashy unless you are trapped in and that 's the only way to get the ball to your guy . If the fundamental pass gets the job done , then that 's good enough for me . Top five passers 1 Jameer Nelson , St. Joseph 's . The Hawks shot a sterling 48.2 percent from the field last year , a testament to Nelson 's ability to get the ball to his teammates in positions where they can succeed . 2 Chris Duhon , Duke . He started only 10 games and did n't play a lot of point guard but still averaged a strong 4.5 assists . If he played the point full-time , he could lead the nation in assists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foremost , is to make his teammates better , which is reflected in his Big 12-best 6.9 assists last season . 4 Can Dickau , Gonzaga . His shooting is attention-grabbing , but he also does other amazing things with the basketball . 5 Imari Sawyer , DePaul . There are sufficient holes in his overall game , including a propensity to turn the ball over . But he did average six assists as a freshman , including many of the **30;688;TOOLONG variety .
