Maya , wait ! " <p> So close , Maya Santino reflected , with a sigh . She 'd actually made it to the staff exit this time . <p> A lanky E.R. nurse swooped in from the side . " Nice try , Doc , but it 's a no go . " Spotting Maya 's earbuds , she cupped a hand to her mouth . " I said , we need you , Dr. S. " <p> " Yes , I gathered that , Jamie . " She pulled out the earbuds and stuffed the iPod into her oversize bag . " What 's the problem ? " <p> " McVey 's here . " <p> Although she wanted to resist , Maya let her friend and colleague propel her back along the corridor . " You do know I was coming off a ten-hour shift even before that last two-hour meeting , right ? " <p> " Is it my fault the man wo n't see anyone but you ? " Jamie Hazell continued to push her forward . " Admissions says his hand 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuses to go to the clinic . Says it 's you or no one . There 's Lysol at the desk if you want it . " <p> Maya grinned . " My uncle raises chickens in South America . Spend a weekend on his farm , then talk to me <p> about McVey . " A brow went up . " Treatment room four ? " <p> " As far from the madding crowd as possible . " <p> " There 's a madding crowd ? " <p> Jamie swept a hand in front of her as they rounded the corner . " You decide . " <p> From Maya 's perspective , it was only mild mayhem . She 'd seen much worse during her three-year tenure at Miami 's Eden Bay Hospital . Once , the sea of gurneys had been so deep , she 'd been forced to climb over one to reach another . <p> Of course , they 'd been smack in the middle of the hurricane season then . Storm after storm had pelted the southern coast . There 'd been home and highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been damaged . Maya 's roof had taken two beatings from uprooted trees . Her car had gotten it from a toppled streetlamp . <p> Reaching out , she straightened her friend 's name badge . " Cheer up , Nurse Hazell . You 're transferring out of the E.R. , remember ? Thirty days and counting . " <p> " Unless Dr. Driscoll changes his mind . It 's happened before . Enjoy your patient . " <p> Five minutes later , her earbuds replaced by a stethoscope around the collar of her lab coat , Maya pushed through the treatment-room door . <p> McVey  --  it was the only name he used  --  sat on a table . His thin shoulders were hunched , and his back was bowed . The thought struck , as it often did , that he seemed familiar in some way . Then , poof , the thought vanished , and he was just McVey again , a man currently in a great deal of pain . <p> He supported his injured left hand with a grimy right . <p> He might not live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did at a low-income apartment complex did n't keep him far from it . <p> " Okay . " Using her two index fingers , she indicated the bloody towel . " What 's the story ? " <p> " Got slammed in a furnace door . Rusty metal , sharp edges . Tore the skin when I jerked free . Uh , is Witch  --  sorry , Nurse Hazell working tonight ? " <p> " I 'm afraid so . " <p> Maya watched his face as she unwrapped the towel . He kept his eyes averted . Meant he was lying about something , though she figured the rusty-metal part was probably true enough . <p> " Any point asking if you 've had a tetanus shot over the past decade ? " <p> He almost smiled , but still did n't meet her eyes . " Any point trying to fake you out ? " <p> " Not much . " It was a deep gash that would require several stitches . " Why me ? " <p> Another near smile . " Because you 're pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But only you remind me of Sabrina . " <p> " Excuse me ? " <p> " The movie , remember ? Audrey Hepburn was the title character . She grew up and was transformed , like you 've done since you came here as a resident . " <p> " Have I known you that long ? Huh , blink and the years fly by . " <p> A grim-faced Jamie came into the room . She sorted through the instrument tray while Maya finished her examination . <p> McVey 's eyes narrowed . " You 're not gon na spray me again , are you , Nurse ? " <p> " I 'd like to do more than spray you , " Jamie retorted , with an expression that made Maya 's lips twitch . <p> " Careful , " she warned when McVey opened his mouth . " Remember , Nurse Hazell administers the local . " <p> He pressed his lips together for the duration , even took the tetanus shot without a whimper . But then she suspected he was accustomed to injections and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in quite as much pain as he could be . <p> " Okay . Done . " She snapped off her latex gloves . " Grab a doughnut on your way out . " <p> The door cracked open , and an intern 's head appeared . " Sorry to interrupt , Doctor , but there 's been a pileup on the interstate . Twenty , maybe thirty cars . Several injuries , and we 're the closest E.R. " <p> " We 're also the most understaffed , " Jamie called after him . " Crap . Why 's it always us ? " <p> " Fate or proximity to the freeway . Take your pick . " Maya started for the door . " Keep that hand as clean as you can , McVey . Come back Monday , before I go off shift , and I 'll look at it . " <p> Her attention shifted instantly at the sound of sirens wailing . She joined the line of attendants jogging toward the entrance . <p> It was going to be a very long night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with his eyes open . Sort of open , Adam amended , inasmuch as he could think with the light that kept tugging at him . Beautiful light , silvery and soft . It had siren qualities , but he resisted the lure . <p> He sensed movement , saw the gray haze alter . Ugly streaks of red slashed it apart . Noise , like shrieking daggers , jabbed into his brain . Hands clutched his shoulders and shook him . <p> " Do n't die , " Falcon pleaded from above . " I need that information back . " <p> Adam would have laughed if an anvil had n't been sitting on his chest . <p> " I have to go . " The snitch 's voice faded . " Someone 'll help you . I 'll come back when you 're better . I do n't think he saw me in the warehouse . I think you blocked his view . " <p> Probably true , Adam thought fuzzily . Man , this had definitely not been his night . <p> The darkness thickened , grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer think . Faces flashed inside the red . His ex-wife 's , his old friend 's , his new enemy 's . <p> Voices shouted indistinct words . The hands on his shoulders fell away . He heard Falcon swear , then a more familiar voice . <p> " Adam ? " <p> Startled but not panicky . Female . <p> " Maya ? " <p> She leaned over , and he saw her face . Exotic features , dark hair , incredible eyes . Bluer than a tropical lagoon . <p> " Screwed up , " he murmured . " Made you hate me . " <p> " I do n't hate you . " <p> Maybe not , but she was waking the pain anyway . <p> The light around him intensified . He was breathing fire now . He felt her hands on him and groped until he caught her wrist . " Stop , " he croaked . " Listen . " <p> " Adam , I ca n't help you if  --  " <p> " I 'm dead , Maya . I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . " <p> " Do what ? " <p> He squeezed . " Take care of things . Made a will last year . Straightforward . Money , investments  --  they 're my sister 's . Condo 's yours . Go through it and  --  Ahh ! " Pain sheared from chest to brain . He had to talk through his teeth . " Do n't let my brother have the Mustang Crash addict . Give my sweet baby to Tal . " He fumbled two sets of keys fromhis pocket . " Condo keys , car keys . Promise . " <p> " Yes , okay , I promise . Now let me help . " <p> " There 's more . Stuff , official stuff . Hid it . Do n't trust anyone , anywhere . Huge mistake . Big fish , small pond . S'all I can say . Tell Tal to finish the deal . " <p> The light flared . It seemed to explode like a starburst that went from a bang to a fizzle . <p> " Sorry , babe . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom you 're good . " <p> " Adam ? " Now she shook him . " Adam ! " <p> The last thing he saw was her face . Then the sparkles died , and there was nothing . <p> " Dr. Santino ? " A nurse with red curls and acne touched her sleeve as she stared at her ex-husband 's face . " A lower body trauma 's just come in . Female . Six months pregnant . " <p> Through the buzz of shock in her head , Maya caught the last part of the nurse 's statement . She shook off what she could and refocused . " Where ? " <p> " Over there . " The young nurse  --  Cassie ? Callie ?  --  pointed . She looked down , then hesitantly up . " Can I , uh , do anything for you ? " <p> " No . Thanks , but no . " With a hand that wanted to shake , Maya closed Adam 's eyes . She regarded the paramedic who 'd helped her lift him from the ground to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right there . " <p> " Got a bleeder over here , " another nurse called . <p> The words jarred . " Thirty seconds , " Maya told the redhead . " Get Jamie to take the bleeder . " <p> Turning away , she pressed two fingers to her temples . She needed to settle herself , to absorb what had just happened . <p> Adam had always been a risk taker . She 'd loved him once , hated him briefly , then figured to hell with it and dealt with her mistakes . With her mistakes . <p> They 'd been strangers , for the most part , after the divorce . He 'd transferred to Orlando , but returned to Miami sixteen months ago , because his roots were here , he 'd said . <p> She understood roots . Hers were mostly here , too . In any case , she had n't hated him by then . <p> " Doctor Santino ? " <p> Her thirty seconds were up . Adam was dead . She could n't make him undead by standing outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of memories swamped her . <p> " I 'm really sorry , Adam . " Head tipped back , she spoke to the night sky . Then shut down and fixed her attention on the living . <p> " Are you awake , Tal ? " Don Drake 's voice hacked rudely into Stephen Talbot 's dream . <p> " Go away , " Tal said into the phone . " I 'm still working the Demorno case . " <p> " You 're done enough to be back in Miami , so listen up . I got a call from Lieutenant Morse in fraud . " <p> Tal tried to prop his eyes open . When that failed , he rolled onto his back and let the watery light outside play against his lids . " You 've got about ten seconds before my brain shuts down . This is the first time I 've seen a bed in three days . " <p> " Tyler 's dead , " his captain growled . That worked . He went up on one elbow . " Adam Tyler ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in the E.R. " Tal swung his feet to the floor . " Eden Bay ? " " You 're two for two . He went to his ex for help  --  or was taken there . Details are sketchy . McGraw 's on his way over to firm up what he can , but since homicide and fraud are more or less cooperating on the Perine investigation , I want a rep there , too . Tyler was a cop , Tal . He was one of us . I know you 're familiar with the case he was working on , even if you were n't directly involved . I want that shooter nailed . Tyler was your friend , so I 'm thinking you 'll want the same thing . " <p> Tal 's sleep-deprived mind resisted the attempt to shove it into line . When had he and Adam talked last ? Seven , maybe eight days ago , and only briefly then . Adam had called him in Tampa . <p> " He said he had a line on Orlando Perine . " " Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell . " Drake gave a grunt . " Grill McGraw , see what he knows , but do n't count on him giving you straight answers . You know how the fraud boys are . Vultures over a rotting carcass . " <p> Standing , Tal bulldozed the last of the grogginess from his brain . His old academy friend was dead . He 'd died at Eden Bay Hospital . Adam 's ex-wife worked at Eden Bay . Had she seen him , spoken to him ? Hell , had she watched him die ? <p> With the light off and the phone wedged between his shoulder and ear , he located his jeans . " Adam was working with an informant last week , " he said . " Some guy who wanted out . Did n't get a name . " <p> " He did n't , or you did n't ? " <p> " Both . He called the guy Falcon . " <p> Dragging a T-shirt over his head , Tal searched for boots , sneakers , shoes  --  anything wearable . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , holding his keys in his mouth , laced them on . <p> " You know Tyler 's ex , do n't you ? " the captain asked . <p> Tal grabbed a jacket . " We 've met . " <p> " Use it . Tyler was a good cop , and homicide 's our business . We call the shots . Fraud 's on the sidelines here . Make sure McGraw understands that . " <p> Tal really did n't care what McGraw understood . Adam had been his friend . Whether officially or unofficially , this was his case now . <p> " Heading out , " he said and tossed the handset aside . <p> Adam Tyler was dead . And the man responsible was going to pay . <p> " You ca n't outrun the truth , Ms. Santino . Someone shot your ex-husband . Someone who works for Orlando Perine , aka the slimiest scumbag in the Sunshine State . " <p> Gene McGraw enunciated the last part of his statement as if speaking to a five-year-old child . Not the best approach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd heard about him had any merit , he was n't the most tactful cop in the fraud division . He certainly was n't the most incisive . <p> Three hours had passed since the first ambulance had pulled in . She 'd lost count of how many patients she 'd treated  --  which was just as well , since counting meant thinking , and thinking would lead her straight to Adam . Not that she could avoid that destination indefinitely . Detective McGraw was dragging her there despite the crush of activity around them . <p> Bumping him back , Maya palpated the ribs of a man groaning on a gurney outside an overflowing treatment room . <p> " Ms. Santino " <p> She turned from the patient . " You do n't seem to be getting it , Detective McGraw . I have n't got time for a cross-examination right now . Although it continues to escape your notice , we 're a bit busy here . " <p> " So the fact that your ex-husband 's been murdered does n't mean diddly to you ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . <p> Appearance-wise , McGraw reminded Maya of a shaggy blond Columbo . In terms of attitude , however , the word caveman sprang to mind . Or perhaps more aptly , her cousin Diego , who she swore was a throwback to one of her mother 's nastier Andalusian ancestors . <p> " Believe me , Detective , I 'd give a great deal to be able to reverse time and bring Adam back , but I ca n't do that , and unless you know some secret science , neither can you . What I can do is help the people in the here and now . Once the last patient is treated , I 'll be more than happy to answer any question you want to throw at me . Until then , the machine in the doctor 's lounge has better coffee than the cafeteria . It 's also free . " <p> Tipping her lips into a quick smile , she sidestepped his arm and was out of range before he could object . <p> " Guess you told him , huh ? <br> Continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
