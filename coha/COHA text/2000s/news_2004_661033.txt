<p> A Hundred years ago , people from every corner of the United States began pouring into St. Louis . From April 30 to Dec. 1 , 1904 , some 20 million visitors toured the 1,240-acre Louisiana Centennial Purchase Exposition - the St. Louis World 's Fair . Besides the 1904 Summer Olympics , there were pavilions from 62 nations and 43 states , a working coal mine , a statue of Teddy Roosevelt made of butter , a mile-long swath of amusements and rides , and food . Food that visitors had never tasted before . <p> Only a handful of the 1,500 buildings constructed for the fair remain . But hamburgers , hot dogs , ice-cream cones , cotton candy , and peanut butter endure . All of them have been labeled as " inventions " of the St. Louis World 's Fair . <p> But did an ice-cream seller really use waffles when he ran out of plates ? Did a sausage vendor really ask his brother-in-law for buns ? We decided to look at the legends . Here 's what we found : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true that sausages used to be sold solo . Because they were served hot , they were sold with a glove . That way , customers would n't get their hands all greasy . <p> The story goes that one day at the St. Louis Fair , Bavarian sausage seller Anton Feuchtwanger ran out of clean gloves . He asked his brother-in-law , a baker , to bake some buns . Feuchtwanger served the sausages in buns . People liked them and began asking for them . And so the hot dog was born . But it was n't called a " hot dog " until 1906 , when cartoonist T.A . Dorgan drew a dachshund in a bun . He labeled it a " hot dog " because he could n't spell " dachshund . " <p> Fact : To be frank , it 's all false . Not only were sausages served in buns before 1904 , they also were called hot dogs before 1906 . <p> The most likely origin of the hot dog , according to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . By 1893 , the item was commonly sold at ballparks . <p> As for " hot dog , " the name was used as early as 1890 , when the Yale Record printed a poem praising the glories of " the dog . " <p> " We thought the story about the cartoon was gospel , " says Janet Riley , a spokeswoman for the NHDSC . " The Smithsonian did a major piece on hot dogs , though , and they could n't find the cartoon . " <p> Sharing burgers worldwide <p> Myth : Serving customers in his Athens , Texas , diner , Fletcher Davis wondered how his servings of ground beef would taste between two slices of bread . His patrons enjoyed the new sandwich so much that they took up a collection to send Davis to the fair so he could present his creation to all . <p> Germans at the fair ( St. Louis has a large German immigrant population ) called the sandwich a " hamburger , " because people in Hamburg , Germany , eat lots of ground beef . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis World 's Fair . A reporter from the New York Tribune wrote about " the innovation . " It 's possible that Davis was present , too : Photographs show " Old Dave 's Hamburger Stand " at the event . But was it invented there ? Baloney . <p> " There are innumerable claims as to when the hamburger began , " says David Hogan , author of " Selling ' Em by the Sack " ( New York University Press , 1997 ) , the story of White Castle hamburgers . " The fact is , it 's been around forever . Its appearance at the fair just gave it national exposure . " <p> Much like hot dogs , hamburgers were the food of German immigrants before they became a cornerstone of American cuisine . <p> Manufacturing ' fairy floss ' <p> Myth : Invented in 1897 by Tennessee candymakers William Morrison and John Wharton , the threads of spun sugar known as " cotton candy " were introduced to the world in St. Louis . <p> Fact : While it is not known for certain who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first electric cotton candy machine in 1899 . The duo took their device to the fair , where they sold the confection under the name " fairy floss . " <p> " Cotton candy had been around years before , " says Pam Vaccaro , author of " Beyond the Ice Cream Cone : The Whole Scoop on Food at the 1904 World 's Fair " ( Enid Press , 2004 ) , " but it was so laborious to make it that it was n't used . " The machine made it accessible to the average person . <p> Ice cream in a rolled zalabia <p> Myth : One day at the St. Louis World 's Fair , a teenage vendor named Arnold Fomachou began to run out of plates and spoons to serve his ice cream . He asked Ernest Hamwi , a Syrian concessionaire next to his booth , what to do . Hamwi gave him some of his zalabia , thin wafflelike pastries from the Middle East . He told Fomachou to roll them into cone shapes and serve ice cream in them . Customers liked them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in zalabia . <p> Fact : There are several versions of this story . Most involve an inventive Syrian and a lack of dishes . One thing is certain : The first ice cream cone was not served at the fair . In 1903 , an Italian immigrant named Italo Marchiony had been given the first US patent for an ice-cream cone . <p> " The only thing that comes remotely close to being the first at the fair , " says Ms. Vaccaro , " was that style of cone , the pointed cone . They called it a ' cornucopia . ' " <p> A new-old product <p> Myth : C.H. Summer introduced peanut butter at the St. Louis World 's Fair . He called it a health food . <p> Fact : Not only was peanut butter not invented at the fair , it may not have been popularized there , either . <p> " There is no primary evidence that anyone in St. Louis had anything to do with popularizing peanut butter , " says Andrew Smith , culinary historian and author of " Peanuts : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois Press , 2002 ) . " If peanut butter was at the fair , it was already popular . People have been grinding it and using it in soups for millennia . " <p> It is true that peanut butter was advertised as a health food because it was considered a good source of protein . <p> Dr. John Kellogg , a physician , claims the first peanut butter patent , " a process for preparing nut meat " in 1895 . ( Does his name sound familiar ? Kellogg also invented corn flakes . ) <p> Was anything invented at the St. Louis Fair ? Yes . It was the first time anyone bought ... puffed rice . <p> " It 's ironic , " Vaccaro comments . " The one thing that really was introduced at the fair did n't get that popular at all . " <p> As for the other edibles , they may not have been invented at the fair , but they probably owe their popularity to the exposure they received there . <p> " Twenty million people came to St. Louis that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Louis World 's Fair Society and a history professor at Southwest Missouri State University . " There 's a pretty good chance they tried one of these foods and then went home and said , ' You 're not going to believe what I ate at the fair . ' " <p> St. Louis : a fair to remember <p> The planet has been host to at least 30 major world 's fairs . Why was the 1904 St. Louis World 's Fair so special ? <p> It was n't the first world 's fair . That title goes to London 's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition , organized by Prince Albert and Henry Cole to showcase England 's industrial prowess . <p> Then , some 13 world 's fairs after that one , came the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition . It was the largest ever , and the most spectacular to date . It not only commemorated the 1803 Louisiana Purchase , it also celebrated America 's accomplishments and offered a glimpse of its future as an industrial - and world - leader . This fair , like others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cultures , new inventions , new scientific advancements . It was also a marketing man 's dream - so many visitors ! <p> In today 's world of instant news , some see little need for a world 's fair . Others insist on the value of firsthand experience , and of bringing together diverse people , products , and ideas . The next world 's fair is in Seto , Japan , from March 25 to Sept. 25 , 2005 . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
