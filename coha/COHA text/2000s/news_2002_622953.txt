<p> In its economic stimulus bill passed in March , Congress gave business a tax break that was supposed to unleash a capital spending boom . <p> Called bonus depreciation , it lets companies that buy capital assets  --  such as computers , delivery trucks and factory equipment  --  write off an extra 30 percent of the purchase price in the first year . <p> When it passed , Sen. Larry Craig , R-Idaho , predicted that the bill  --  which also provided an extra 13 weeks of unemployment benefits  --  could transform " an economy that is recovering into a roaring recovery . " <p> Did bonus depreciation work ? <p> Not that I can tell . <p> Economists say you ca n't measure the impact of tax breaks until years after they take effect . Even then , it 's hard to isolate them from other factors in the economy or gauge what would have happened without them . In short , it 's hard to say if they do any good . <p> What you can say is that business spending is in the toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital spending was $3.35 trillion , down from $3.66 trillion in the same period last year and $3.79 trillion in the same period of 2000 , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis . <p> " We 've entered the ice age of capital investment , " says Ned Riley , chief investment strategist with State Street Global Advisors . " We 're just frozen . " <p> For months , Riley has been predicting a fourth-quarter spurt in tech spending as companies rush to buy gear before the year 's end so they can lock in a bigger tax deduction for 2002 . <p> When I called tech companies to see if they or their customers were taking advantage of bonus depreciation , their spokespeople said , " Bonus what ? " <p> " For reasons we ca n't quite understand , it has n't taken hold , " says Caroline Graves Hurley , tax counsel with the American Electronics Association , which lobbied hard for bonus depreciation . <p> HOW IT WORKS : The bonus applies to assets bought between Sept. 11 , 2001 , and Sept. 10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 . <p> Suppose a company buys a $1,000 computer , which is depreciable over five years . ( Different assets have different depreciation schedules , based on their expected lives . ) <p> Typically , a company could write off 20 percent , or $200 , the first year . <p> With bonus depreciation , it could write off 30 percent ( or $300 ) plus 20 percent of the remaining $700 ( or $140 ) for a first-year deduction of $440 . <p> If the company is in the 35 percent tax bracket , it saves $154 with bonus depreciation , versus $70 without . <p> Under either scenario , the company can deduct a total of $1,000 over five years . The bonus does n't give additional depreciation , it just speeds it up . <p> Many states , including California , did not conform to the federal tax break because it would have cost them too much . <p> Bonus depreciation does n't reduce a company 's reported earnings . It only affects its tax books , not the books it keeps for shareholders . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it generally ca n't take advantage of bonus depreciation . The same is true for profitable companies that have so many other tax breaks they do n't pay taxes . <p> However , if a company is n't paying taxes , but did pay them in any of the past five years , it might be able to take advantage of the additional depreciation by carrying back its loss to earlier , profitable years and claiming a tax refund , says Glenn Mackles , a partner with Deloitte and Touche . <p> WHY IT 'S NOT WORKING : One reason the bonus has limited appeal is that many companies are n't paying taxes . <p> Another explanation is that companies have until September 2004 to take advantage of it . <p> Companies may be " strategically waiting until the very end of that window , " says Hurley . <p> The biggest reason is that businesses bought too much capital equipment in the late 1990s and have way more than they need . <p> " People talk about the stock market bubble . We really had an investment bubble , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanford 's business school . <p> Who needs to buy a new server when you can get a slightly used one at a dot-com auction for one-tenth the cost ? <p> Businesses wo n't buy more until what they have wears out , becomes obsolete  --  or until demand picks up enough up to warrant added capacity . <p> Before that , investment tax incentives are not likely to help and could hurt . <p> " To encourage people to buy more equipment when there is too much does n't make sense to me , " says Strnad . <p> EXPANDING THE BONUS : Nevertheless , when Congress meets in January to work on a new economic stimulus package , one proposal it will debate is beefing up bonus depreciation . <p> In a letter to President Bush , the National Association of Manufacturers wrote , " While it is still too early to gauge the full benefit of this temporary provision , it is clear that , to be an effective catalyst for economic growth , the bonus depreciation should be increased from 30 to 60 percent and extended for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleman , the association 's vice president of tax policy , says bonus depreciation needs more time to work its magic . <p> " It 's only been around for eight months , " she says . <p> Coleman says that a major plant expansion can take years to plan and build and that ending the bonus in 2004 is a disincentive . <p> But many economists say extending the deadline will cause companies to delay their purchases even longer . By 2006 , the tax break could be wasted on companies that would have bought equipment without an incentive . <p> Even worse , it could choke off the economy . " We might be steaming along at full employment . If you have additional stimulus pushing up demand ( to stem inflation ) , you either raise interest rates or tighten the money supply , which could abort the recovery , " says Len Burman , a senior fellow with the Urban Institute . <p> Burman , and many Democrats , favor tax goodies that give money to those most likely to spend it . Options include extending unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Business Roundtable , a group of big-company CEOs , has proposed exempting the first $10,000 of income from Social Security and Medicare taxes next year . These payroll taxes amount to 12.4 percent of wages , split evenly between the employer and employee . <p> The tax holiday would give $620 to each employee making at least $10,000 , and an equal amount to his or her employer . <p> The government would reimburse the Social Security trust fund from general revenues . <p> Unlike a cut in marginal tax rates , which only helps people who earn enough to pay taxes , a payroll tax holiday would give money to every working American , including low-income ones most likely to spend it . It would also start pumping money into the economy immediately . <p> Many economists  --  and business groups  --  say the best way to stimulate business investment is to increase end-user demand . <p> To that end , the Business Roundtable also favors speeding up cuts in marginal-tax-rate cuts that were supposed to take effect in 2004 and 2006 into 2003 . It also wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not endorse expanding bonus depreciation . <p> " Right now , there 's no demand for what businesses are producing . If you give them incentives to invest more , all it will do is create more overcapacity , " says Vince Randazzo , the roundtable 's director of public policy . <p> Of course , stimulating consumers  --  whose closets , garages and second homes are overflowing  --  has its own problems . <p> " Consumers are out on the edge . They have borrowed so much and saved so little . If anything , they need a cut in consumption , " says Strnad . <p> Extending unemployment benefits or cutting payroll taxes may produce an immediate stimulus , but it provides no long-term incentive for employees to become more productive . <p> Strnad and Burman say there 's a case to be made for doing nothing  --  letting the economy work out its excesses without adding stimulus that could come back to bite . But of course , they 're not running for election in two years .
