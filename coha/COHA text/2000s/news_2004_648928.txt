<p> A year ago , a surprising and unusual alliance of university trustees and professors was formed , a partnership aimed at finding ways to restrain the growth and excesses of big-time college sports . At the time , it was likened to the Hatfields joining forces with the McCoys . <p> Twelve months later , the faculty group , known as the Coalition on Intercollegiate Athletics , is still looking for new allies and still turning to the list of long-established adversaries for help . Late last month , the coalition of professors met privately with a group of college athletic directors , those hands-on managers of the modern monolith of intercollegiate athletics . <p> " On the face of it , it was the cobra sitting down with the mongoose , " said James Earl , an English professor at the University of Oregon and the co-chairman of the faculty coalition . He attended the meeting of five prominent leaders of faculty senates and five athletic directors representing some of the foremost college athletic powers . <p> " You would think on the subject of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common ground , " he said . " But in fact , we got along well . There was no strong disagreement . " <p> Andy Geiger , the director of athletics at Ohio State , attended the meeting , which was convened Jan. 23 by Myles Brand , president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association , at the association 's headquarters in Indianapolis . <p> " There 's no question , everyone came into the room pretty defensive , " Geiger said . " But the athletic directors discovered we were n't being called into the woodshed . That calmed me down right away . I left the meeting feeling that this group can go farther toward making real , genuine change than any other group I know of . " <p> Brand had a similar reaction . " These were two groups that were n't talking , " he said . " There was a lot of suspicion . True , they still wo n't agree on everything . But now there is trust building and that is an incredibly important outcome . For there to be real change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Just where they are heading is another matter . The goals of the alliance of faculty and trustees , which has also enlisted the guidance and endorsement of the N.C.A.A. leadership , are sweeping . It is seeking a series of revisions in how an athletic department interacts with the rest of a university  --  dealing with everything from athletic abuses that have led to scandal , to curbing the continuing race to build newer , more lavish athletic facilities . The timetable for any change could be as long as a decade . <p> These broad goals , which deal with many topics , may not be controversial by themselves . But how they would be implemented and what kind of N.C.A.A. rulings they would require is controversial . Faculty members and athletic directors at the meeting last month agreed that the manner in which individual institutions put policy into practice varies so greatly from campus to campus that a single new reform measure could probably be applied in dozens of different ways . The logistics of that process are thorny . <p> Still , several of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was uniform agreement on many short-term goals , like the N.C.A.A. 's academic initiative that would tie the classroom performance of athletes to the number of athletic scholarships a college is permitted to award . <p> " Not only was there no disagreement on new academic standards , there was no disagreement as to whether these changes were a good idea , " said Geiger , who is on the board of the association of Division I-A athletic directors and who oversees one of the largest college athletic budgets . " I think the faculty members were more surprised at our stand than we were at theirs . " <p> Robert Eno , an associate professor of East Asian studies at Indiana and a co-chairman of the faculty coalition , said he thought the athletic directors were comforted by better understanding his group , too . " They learned that we were n't a bunch of radical , inflexible faculty addicted to yelling about athletics , " he said . <p> Also attending was Virginia Shepherd , a pathology professor and a past president of the faculty senate at Vanderbilt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalition . The athletic directors at the meeting were Geiger , Kevin White of Notre Dame , Rick Dickson of Tulane , Jim Copeland of Southern Methodist and Larry Templeton of Mississippi State . <p> The day after the meeting , the coalition of faculty leaders met with John D. Walda , chairman of the board of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges , an organization that represents 34,500 trustees , regents , presidents , chancellors and administrators . In that meeting , according to Eno and Earl , Walda detailed plans to present new guidelines for how involved trustees should be in the governing of athletics on campuses nationwide . <p> " That presentation , to me , was breathtaking , " Earl said . " All of us , in many quarters , are much more on the same page with this than anyone would have ever thought . " <p> The faculty coalition 's origins can be traced to Earl and the Oregon campus in Eugene . Professors protested when the university , in the midst of budget cuts in other departments , announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the football stadium . Dissent on the Oregon campus bred a movement to re-examine the role of athletics at the university . Then , taking Oregon 's lead , faculty senates across the West Coast joined together in a similar effort . This movement spread eastward , and now more than 60 major universities , most of them in conferences that are part of college football 's Bowl Championship Series , have participated in the Coalition on Intercollegiate Athletics . <p> Last year , the coalition spawned another new association  --  among the coalition , the governing boards group and the N.C.A.A.  --  called the Alliance for Athletic Reform . This group has also proposed an initial set of goals . And in the last six months , there have been conventions and meetings on college athletic reform involving a host of other groups , including the American Association of University Professors and an association of college academic advisers for athletes . <p> " We are looking for ways to do more than talk , " Eno said . " But as the endorsements build between college administrators , faculty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hope is that the volume of support will exert continued constructive pressure on all groups connected with athletics and with reform . <p> " We have to wait for the payoff , but we have every intention of moving comprehensive reform from rhetoric to a real possibility . " <p> Among the most promising accomplishments of the recent meeting between athletic directors and faculty members , both sides agreed , was what the professors learned about how athletic directors do their jobs . <p> " It was a productive dialogue because it laid out the crux of the dilemma , " Dickson of Tulane said . " On the one hand , we have athletic programs operating in a completely balanced setting , being told they must maximize revenue to pay for themselves independent of the institution . And on the other hand , the athletic programsare told that philosophically they must be integrated with the campus . " <p> Brand , who sounded the most enthusiastic about what the meeting had accomplished , said he thought the reform movement would continue to flourish precisely because it had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletics is the growing separation of athletic departments , in fact and in attitude , from the rest of the campus , " Brand said . " We 've got to bring athletics back into a single college experience . " <p> While some skeptics may dismiss this kind of coalition building as merely chatter , the participants think otherwise . " People might say this is just talk , " Geiger said . " They 're right ; it is just talk . And we 're not going to get anywhere without talk . Not everybody agrees what kind of change there will be . But there will be change . And it can start with the help of the folks who were in that room in Indianapolis . " <p> There was a final outcome of the meeting between faculty leaders and athletic directors : they agreed to meet again this spring . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
