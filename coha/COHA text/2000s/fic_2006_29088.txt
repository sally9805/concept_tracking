Book One Oh ! we do n't want to lose you But we think you ought to go , For your King and your Country Both need you so . We shall want you and miss you , But with all our might and main We shall cheer you , thank you , kiss you When you come home again . " Your King and Country Want You " Lyrics by Paul Rubens 1 The letter was stained with mud from France , but there was a British army stamp in the corner , and the handwriting looked fancy and official . Maybe Hector had won a medal ! He 'd finally given the Huns a good , hard punch on the nose . I left the general store , nearly tripping on the sidewalk planks as I searched the envelope for clues about its contents . I wanted to rip it open , but it had been addressed to Dad . My breath turned to frost in the October air . Hector must 've jumped out of the trenches and taken a machine-gun nest , or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined up in 1916 , so he 'd been over there for more than a year ; lots of time to do something heroic . I jogged the half mile to our farm , watching for our white and green house to appear on the other side of the hill , with the rolling prairie spread out beyond it . Maybe Hector would be getting a Victoria Cross pinned to his chest . He would make the papers all across Canada . I stopped in my tracks . I fingered the thin envelope , mymouth dry . What if it 's not a medal . What if . . . I would n't let myself think the words . If he 'd fallen in France I 'd surely have felt something deep in my heart , even thousands of miles away here in Saskatchewan . Such dark thoughts had made my legs numb . I leaned against our sign that said bathe family farm . Father had carved it to put a name to the fields he 'd cut out of the prairie . Land he intended to pass on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but perhaps he 'd been so badly wounded that he could n't even pick up a pen . My hand shook as I flicked open my pocketknife and slit the envelope . I 'd tell Dad I just could n't wait to read the good news . I scanned the first few lines . R.S. Major 27/09/17 15th Canadian Batt B.E.F . Dear Mr. Wilfred Bathe , You will no doubt wonder who this is writing to you . I will try to explain as well as I can ; I am the regimental sergeant major of the above battalion . I have a very painful duty to perform in -- My heart stopped . It was n't just a " painful duty , " but a " very painful duty , " and I knew what had to follow . I sucked in a rattling breath . And another . Oh , God . Oh , no . I forced myself to move toward the house . It was an eternity before I got there . I opened the door , the squeaking hinge unusually loud . I passed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union Jack that hung on the wall . I pulled myself up with the rail . I 'd gone from sixteen to a hundred years old . At the top of the landing I stopped to wipe my icy , sweaty palms on my overalls . I glanced at the oval photograph of Dad in his dragoons uniform , medals from the South African war glittering on his chest . Hung next to him was the picture of Mother in her Sunday best , and the thought of her made my legs go weak . It was a blessing God had taken her ; today would have broken Mom 's heart . Beside her was a photograph of Hector and me , when he was fourteen and I was twelve . I looked away and tried to swallow the lump in my throat . Maybe he 'd just been terribly wounded , his bright green eyes blinded by gas . That was why he could n't write . Or perhaps his arm had been blown off . If so , when he got home he would still be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would . I knocked and entered the master bedroom . The stink of pee and old sweat hung in the air , a sign of how weak Dad was now . He lay sleeping , sheets pulled up to his neck , cheekbones sticking out of his long , pale face as though he were starving . His once proud and bushy mustache was limp and stringy . I sat on the wooden chair and waited , my hands still trembling . Dad had been bedridden for seven months , leaving me to seed , harvest , and do the chores . In March , on the anniversary of Mom 's death , he stayed in bed all day , as prickly as a cactus . He did n't get up the next day , or the next . In fact , he did n't get up at all . He gave up on everything . The man I 'd seen flip and pin a calf in a heartbeat could n't even pull himself out of bed . It was n't the first time he 'd been bedridden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stay in bed . Mom would give him a day or two before she grabbed his work clothes and boots and goaded him to his feet . After her funeral he spent three days in bed . On the fourth day Hector set Dad 's work clothes and boots on the end of the bed . Dad was out to the barn within an hour , not saying a word . This time , I 'd tried the same trick after the first week , but no luck . When it came to Dad , Hector had the magic touch ; it 'd always been that way . All I could do was call Dr. Fusil , an old man with sharp eyes . This was , of course , against Father 's wishes . " Wilfred 's body is fine , " Dr. Fusil said out on the front porch after the visit . He slowly pulled on his coat . " His mind , though , is troubled . If his condition worsens and he refuses all food and water , there 's a sanitarium in Regina I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load , though . " I 'm already doing all the work ! I felt like shouting . But instead , I only shrugged , and the doctor putted away in his Model T. Now , I sat back in the chair , making it creak . " What 's in your hand , Edward ? " Father asked . His gray eyes searched mine . I could see every long day he 'd worked . " It 's a letter from Hector 's major . " From the Hardcover edition . Continues ...
