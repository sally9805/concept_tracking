BAUER 'S BIGGEST FLOP <P> Religious conservative and G.O.P. presidential hopeful Gary Bauer finally dropped out of the primary race last Friday . Something to do with his sub-1% showing in New Hampshire , said the pundits . Aficionados of his star turn at last Monday 's Bisquick pancake contest know better . Here 's the play-by-play : <P> 1 Bauer , who once said making pancakes was his hidden talent , sends a doughy orb skyward <P> 2 The trajectory of the flapjack takes him dangerously close to the edge of the 4-ft. riser <P> 3 Bauer tumbles off and disappears behind a curtain , where George W. Bush says : Oh , oh ! Here comes Bauer . <P> 4 A concerned staff member searches for him , as Bauer 's red face pops back through the curtain <P> 5 Bauer jumps back on the stage with the spatula ( but not the pan ) and declares : I 'm a fighter !
