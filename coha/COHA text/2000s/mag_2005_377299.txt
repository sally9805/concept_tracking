A full-fledged pillow fight is under way in the hotel industry , with one chain after another firing shots to claim the title for the industry 's most comfortable bed . The latest challenger : Marriott International , which announced last month that it was spending $190 million to replace 628,000 beds in 2,400 hotels with plusher mattresses and 300-thread-count sheets . " It 's the biggest makeover in the history of the industry , " says J.W. Marriott Jr. , chairman and CEO , who ( with his sons , below ) donned flannel jammies for the announcement . The mattress war began five years ago , when Westin launched the " Heavenly Bed , " a pillow-top mattress with crisp white linens . Since then , virtually every hotel chain has joined the battle . Last fall , for instance , Radisson Hotels began installing 90,000 Select Comfort firmness-adjustable beds . And Four Points hotels ( Westin 's sister brand ) is adding new 11.5-in . Sealy plush-top beds.  --  Dody Tsiantar               @ @ @ @ @ @
