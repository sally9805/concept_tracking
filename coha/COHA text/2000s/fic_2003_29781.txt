Northern Louisiana , the forty-third year of the Kurian Order : The green expanse once known as the Kisatchie Forest slowly digests the works of man . A forest in name only , it is a jungle of wet heat and dead air , a fetid overflowing of swamps , bayous , and backwaters . The canopy of interwoven cypress branches shrouded in Spanish moss creates a gloom so thick that twilight rules even at midday . In the muted light , collapsing houses subside every which way as roadside stops decay in vine-choked isolation , waiting for traffic that will not return . A long file of people is moving among moss-covered trunks to the piping cries of startled birds . At the front and rear of the column are men and women in buckskin , faces tanned to the same weather-beaten color as their leather garments . They carry sheathed rifles in a number of different manners , but all are ready to use their weapons at the first hint of danger . The guns are for the defense of five clusters of families clad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and along the inner thighs suggest the garments once glowed a vivid optic yellow , now faded from heavy use . A string of five pack-mules follows behind them under the guidance of teenage versions of the older warriors . At the head of the column , well behind a pair of silent scouts , a young man scans the trail . He still has some of the awkward gangliness of youth , but his dark eyes hold a canny depth . His shoulder-length black hair , tightly tied at the back of his head , shines like a raven 's feathers even in the half-light . Between his dusky skin and buckskin garb , he could be mistaken for a native resident of this area three centuries before : perhaps the son of some wandering French trapper and a Choctaw maiden . His long-fingered hands wander across his heavy belt , from holstered pistol to binoculars , touching the haft of his broad-bladed parang before moving on to the canteens at his waist . A scratched and battered compass case dangles from a black nylon cord around his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its slung position . Unlike his men , he is hatless . He turns now and again to check the positions of his soldiers and to examine the faces of his yellow-clad dependents as if gauging how much distance is left in their weary bodies . But his restless eyes do not remain off the trail for long , they always return to scouting ahead . If they come , they 'll come tonight . Lieutenant David Valentine returned to that thought again as the masked sun vanished below the horizon , turning the overcast into waves of color . He had hoped to get his charges further north of the old interstate before nightfall , but progress had slowed on this , their fourth day out from Red River Crossing . He and his Wolves shielded twenty-seven men , women , and children who had decided to make the dangerous run to freedom . The families were now adapted to the rigors of the trail , and followed orders well . But as they came from a world where disobedience meant death , that trait was understandable . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Free Territory . But Valentine was determined to see the escaping Red River farmhands brought safely north . The yellow-clad group had crossed the final barrier , the road and rail line connecting Dallas with the Mississippi at Vicksburg , four hours ago . Then Valentine had driven them another two miles . Now they had little left to give . It was hard to quiet his mind , with so much to think about on his first independent command in the Kurian Zone . And quieting his mind , keeping lifesign down , was literally a question of life and death with night coming on . The Reapers read lifesign better at night , and he knew his charges were giving off enough to be read for miles even in the depths of the Kisatchie . Being a Wolf was as much a matter of mental as physical discipline , for the Reapers sensed the activity of human minds , especially when fearful and tense . Every Wolf had a method of subsuming consciousness into a simpler , almost feral level . But burdened with new responsibilities and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shot up like poisonous weeds in his mind . A trilling call from ahead broke into his anxieties . Valentine raised his arm , halting the column . Garnett , one of his scouts , gestured to him . " Water , sir , in that little holler , " the scout reported as Valentine came up to take a look . " Looks safe enough . " " Good . We 'll rest there for an hour , " Valentine said , loudly enough for the column to hear . " No more . We 're still too close to the road to camp . " The spirits of the Wolves and the farm families brightened in contrast to the deepening night as they drank from the spring trickling down the side of a shallow ravine . Some removed shoes and rubbed aching feet . Valentine unscrewed the cap on his plastic canteen , waiting until the families and his men had a chance to drink . A faint yelping echoed from the south . Wolves dived for cover behind trees and fallen logs . The yellow-clad families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in alarm at the sudden movement . Sgt. Patel , Valentine 's senior non-commissioned officer , appeared at his elbow . " Dogs ? Very bad luck , sir . Or ? " Valentine , careening along in his runaway train of thought , only half-heard Patel 's words . The families broke out in noisy consternation . " Silence , " Valentine rasped at the civilians , his voice cracking with unaccustomed harshness . " Sergeant , who knows this area best ? " Patel 's eyes did not leave the woods to the south . " Maybe Lugger , sir . Or the scouts . Lugger pulled a lot of patrols in this area , I think her people lived westaways . " " Would you get her , please ? " Patel pointed to and brought up Lugger , a seasoned veteran whose limber , sparse frame belied her name . She held her rifle in alabaster knuckles . " Sir ? " she breathed . " Lugger , we may have to do some shooting soon , " Valentine said in an undertone , trying not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good spot for it ? " Her eyes wandered skyward in thought . " There 's an old barn we used to use on patrol . West of here , more like northwest . Concrete foundation , and the loft is in good shape . " " How long to get there ? " " Under an hour , sir , even with them , " she said , jerking her chin toward the huddled families . Their yellow overalls now looked bluish in the darkness . Valentine nodded encouragement . " Solid foundation , " she repeated . " And a big water trough . We used to keep it filled with a rain catcher . " " Not the direction I wanted to go , but it will have to do . Mallow 's more to the east , " Valentine said . Mallow , the senior Lieutenant of Zulu Company , had remained in the borderlands with a cache of supplies to help them make it the rest of the way to the Ozark Free Territory . He considered something else . " Think you could find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she responded after a moment 's cogitation . " Then take your team and go . Ask Mallow to come with everything he can . " " Yes , sir . But I do n't need my team to keep me company . I think you 'll need every gun you got before morning , " she said , unslinging her rifle . Valentine nodded . " Let 's not waste time then . Tell Patel where to go , then run for our lives . " Lugger gave her rifle to the senior aspirant , spoke briefly to Patel and the scouts , then disappeared into the darkness . Valentine listened with hard ears to her fading footfalls , as fast as his beating heart , and thought please Mallow , for God 's sake forget about the supplies and come quick . As his men dusted the area around the spring with red pepper , Valentine approached the frightened families . " They found us ? " asked Fred Brugen , the patriarch of the group . Valentine smiled into their dirty , tired faces . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our trail , could be a dog got the wrong end of a skunk . But as I said , we have to play it safe and move to a better place to sleep . Sorry to cut the halt short . " The refugees winced and tightened their mouths at the news , but did not complain . Complainers disappeared in the night in the Kurian Zone . " The good news is that we 're really close to a place we can rest and get a hot meal or two . Personally , I 'm getting sick of cornbread and jerky . " He squatted down to the kids ' level and forced some extra enthusiasm into his voice . " Who wants hotcakes for breakfast tomorrow morning ? " The kids lit up like fireflies , nodding with renewed energy . " Okay , then , " he finished as he filled his canteen , forcing himself go through the motions nonchalantly . " Everybody take one more drink of water and let 's go . " The aspirants somehow got the pack-mules moving , and the column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of stumbles brought on by confusion and fatigue in the night , the column continued north . Valentine led the way . A rope around his waist stretched back to Sgt. Patel at the tail end of the file . He bade the families to hold onto it to keep everyone together in the dark . One scout guided him and a second brought up the rear , in close contact with two fire-teams shepherding the column 's tail , phosphorous candles ready . If the enemy was close enough for their dogs to be heard , the Reapers could be upon them at any moment . Valentine resigned himself to the orders he would give if they were set upon in the open : he would abandon his charges and flee north . Even a few Wolves were more valuable to the Free Territory than a couple of dozen farmers . Valentine , continuing on that grim train of thought , decided that if he were a battle-hardened veteran from the campfire stories , he would stake the farmers out like goats to a prowling tiger , then ambush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goat was worth getting the tiger . Those win-at-all-costs leaders from the old-world history books would never be swayed by sleepy voices repeatedly asking , " Is it much further , Momma ? " " Close up and move on . Close up and move on , " Valentine said over his shoulder , hurrying along the column . Wolves picked up tired children , carrying them as easily as they bore their arms . They found the farm exactly as Lugger had described . Her Wolf 's eye for terrain and detailed memory of places and paths would astound anyone who did not know the caste . The barn was a little bigger than Valentine would have liked with only twenty-two guns . No time to be picky , not with the Reapers on our trail , he thought . Anyplace with the trees cleared away and walls would have to do . Garnett entered with blade unsheathed , covered by hunting bow and rifle . The parang - a shortened machete used by the Wolves - gleamed in the mist-shrouded moonlight . A few bats fluttered out , disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scout appeared at the loft door and waved the rest in . Valentine led the others inside , fighting a disquieting feeling that something was wrong . Perhaps his Indian blood perceived something tickling below his conscious threshold . He had spent enough time on the borders of the Kurian Zone to know that his sixth sense was worth paying attention to , though hard to qualify . The danger was too near somehow , but ill defined . He finally dismissed it as the product of overwrought nerves . Valentine inspected the sturdy old barn . The water trough was full , which was good , and there were shaded lanterns and oil , which was better . Patel posted the men to the doors , windows and holes in the time-ravaged structure . The exhausted families threw themselves down in a high-walled inner corner . Valentine made for the ladder to the hayloft . Someone had repaired a few of the rungs , he noticed as he went up squeaking wood . From the loft he watched his second scout , Gonzalez , backing into the barn , rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' em sir , " Garnett reported from his perch at the upper door . " He always gets bug-eyed when they 're around . " Three Wolves from downstairs joined them and took positions on each side of the barn . Valentine glanced down through a gap in the loft floor to the lower level , where Patel talked quietly to Gonzalez in the dim light of a screened lantern . Both glanced up into the loft . Gonzalez nodded and climbed the ladder . " Sir , the Sarge wanted me to show you this , " he reported , extending a filthy and stinking piece of cloth drawn from his pocket . Valentine reached out to take the rag when a chorus of shrieks sounded from down the hill in the direction of the old road . He spun and ran to the wide loft door . Garnett cursed . " Ravies , goddamn Ravies ! " The banshee wailing out of the midnight mists turned the back of his neck into a bristle-brush . They 're here ! He bent to the gap in the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your posts , look to your fronts ! The Ravies might be a ruse . They could be on top of the hill already . " He ran to the ladder and clambered down the rungs two at a time , driving a splinter into the flesh opposite his thumb in his haste . Wincing , he unsnapped the leather strap of his parang sheath and drew his revolver . " Uncle , the candles , " he shouted , but Patel knew better than to wait for an order . The veteran sergeant already stood at the gaping southern door lighting one . A Wolf opened a lantern door so he could thrust it in . The high , feminine shrieking in the night grew louder . The candle burst into flame , filling the barn with blue-white light and sharp black shadows . Patel wound up and threw the burning flare down the slope they had just traversed . Before it landed he lit another and hurled it into the darkness as well . Other Wolves copied him , tossing candles in each direction . Valentine stared down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Running figures with arms thrashing as if trying to swim through the air swept up toward the barn . Seemingly endless supplies of wind powered their screams . The siren wail was paralyzing . They were human , or what amounted to human considering their minds burned with madness , but with the wasted look of corpses and sparse streams of unkempt hair . Few wore more than tatters of clothing ; most ran naked their skin pale in the light of burning phosphorus . " Do n't let ' em in close enough to bite . Drop ' em , goddammit ! " Patel bellowed . Shots rang out in the enclosed lower level of the barn . A few Ravies fell , one rising again with blood pouring from his neck , to stagger a few paces and fall once more , this time for good . Another had a bullet tear through her shoulder , spinning her around like a puppet with tangled strings . She regained her balance and came on , screaming all the while . A scrawny ten-year-old boy stepped on one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human wave approached , dribbling bodies as the Wolves ' bullets told . He knew the Ravies served as a distraction for something else lurking in the night . He felt the Reaper stalking his mind , approaching from the darkness , even if he could not see its body . It came , full of awful speed and power . A cloaked figure charged into the light , seeming to fly over the ground in a blur of motion . " Hood ! " a Wolf shouted , squeezing off a shot and working the bolt on his rifle . The caped-and-cowled figure made a leap twenty feet from the barn , crashing bodily through the old planks and beams as if they were papier-mch . The Reaper landed on all fours , arms and legs splayed like a spider . Before a gun could be turned in its direction , it sprang at the nearest Wolf , a shovel-bearded wedge of a man named Selbey . It was upon him before he could bring up his gun . The Hood 's satchel-sized mouth opened to display ebony pointed teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown up in defense . The Wolf 's scream matched those from outside as the thing opened its mouth to bite again . Chaos reigned as the farmhands began running . Wolves at the exits had to restrain them , taking up precious seconds when they should have been employing their guns . One Wolf pumped shot after shot , working the lever action rifle from his hip , into the Reaper pressing Selbey to the detritus-covered floor . The Reaper seemed immune to the bullets hitting its heavy robes . Valentine grabbed a candle-flare from Patel 's two remaining at the south door . He thrust the candle into the lantern , waiting for it to sputter into life . It caught on after an eternity , and he ran towards the Hood . The thing raised its blood-smeared face from the twitching victim to receive the burning end in its eye . It howled out its fury and pain and slapped the candle out of Valentine 's hand with the speed of a leopard 's paw . The flaming wand fell to the ground as the thing rose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of the barn . Death reached for Valentine , who struggled to draw his blade from its sheath in time . A bullet caught the Reaper in the armpit , staggering it . A heavier leather-clad missile hurled itself onto the Hood 's back . Patel 's body-blow brought it down , and using every ounce of his formidable strength the Sergeant managed to keep it on the floor until Valentine brought his machete onto the back of its neck . The blade bit deep into flesh and bone , but failed to sever the head . Oily black ink poured from the wound , but still the thing rose , rolling Patel off with a heave . The Sergeant fought on and bore down on one arm , ignoring the deadly teeth opening for him . Valentine lashed out again with his machete , catching it under the jaw . The Reaper 's head arced off to land with a thud next to Selbey 's lifeless body . " Jesus , they 're in , they 're in ! " someone shouted . A few Ravies , ghoulishly white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap in the wall created by the decapitated Reaper . Valentine shifted his parang to his left hand and reached for his pistol . The empty holster turned the movement into comic mime as he realized he had dropped the gun while getting the candle . But other Wolves drew their pistols , snapshooting at the shrieking forms . The screaming grew into a chorus : a Ravie plunged in among the families . Valentine rushed to the corner to find the howling lunatic pinned against the wall by a man who 'd had the presence of mind to grab an old pitchfork when the fight started . The Ravie had both hands on the haft of the weapon , trying to wrench the tines out of her belly , when Valentine came in , swinging his parang to strike and strike and strike again until she sank lifeless to the floor , at long last silent . The screaming outside had ceased . A final bullet or two ended the spasms of the few crawling , crippled targets still living and therefore still dangerous . The men in the loft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored the chatter and saw with a kind of weary grief that the impaled Ravie had bitten one of the wives . He went to check on Patel . The husky Sergeant was on his feet , one arm hanging limp and useless , Valentine 's pistol in his working hand . Patel handed the pistol back to the Lieutenant . " Quiet , up there , and keep your eyes peeled , " the Sergeant shouted at the uncomprehending floorboards above . He held his hurt arm closer to his body , grimacing . " Broken collar bone , I think , " he explained . " Could be my shoulder is out as well . Are you okay , sir ? " " Hell , Patel , enough is enough . Next it 'll be ' I hope you liked your drink . ' Let 's get that arm in a sling , for a start . " Valentine motioned an idle Wolf over to help his sergeant . He saw another of his men bandaging the Ravie bite on the woman as her family anxiously crowded around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it yet , " he said , sotto voce . His sergeant nodded with sad understanding , and Valentine thought of Patel 's family . They had been taken by the Raving Madness five years ago . The Lieutenant walked through his shaken command , checking on his men , and came into the corner sheltering the escapees . He shot a significant glance at his Wolf attending to the woman ; the man caught the hint and nodded . " The bleeding 's stopped already , sir . " " Quick action , Mosley . Grab someone and get that , " he pointed at the lifeless Ravie , " out of here . " The candles outside were sputtering out . Valentine walked over to the ladder , intending to visit the men upstairs . Whoever loosed the Ravies might still be out there ? when the floor suddenly tilted beneath his feet . Thrown to the floor , he saw an albino-white arm open a heavy trap door in an explosion of dirt , dried leaves and twigs . The barn had a cellar . The Reaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Valentine 's head . His Wolves , still keyed up from the fight , aimed their guns with lethal speed and pumped bullet after bullet into the yellow-eyed creature . Under the point-blank crossfire from five directions , the black-robed shape jerked wildly and fell back into the basement . " Grenades , " Valentine bellowed . Three of his men gathered at the trapdoor , now shooting down with pistols . Striking matches or using the lanterns , two Wolves lit fuses on the baseball-sized bombs and hurled them down the square hole . Valentine grabbed the trap door and flung it shut . The rusty hinges squealed their complaints . The first explosion threw the door forever off its aged fastenings and the second boomed with an ear-splitting roar . Smoke mushroomed from the square hole . The Reaper sprang from the gap like something a magician had conjured from the smoke , arms nothing but two tarry stumps and head a bony mask of horror . Even with its face blown off , the Reaper was on its feet and running , seeming to favor them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the apparition fled through the exit , knocking Patel aside like a bowling pin in the path of a cannon ball as the Sergeant attempted another body-blow . A tattered and smoldering cape streaming out behind it as it ran , the Reaper disappeared into the darkness . Some of the children had hands over their ears , screaming in pain . Valentine tried to shake the drunken , underwater sensation that seemed to come over him , but it was no use . The acrid air of the barn seemed too thick to allow breathing . He staggered to the doorjamb and vomited into the night . An hour later , with the barn cleared of bodies except for the unfortunate Selbey , who lay in his woolen blanket in the empty blackness of the blasted cellar , Gonzalez again troubled Valentine . His scout , after asking for permission to speak privately in the loft , presented him with the filthy strip of cloth . Valentine examined the excrement-stained yellow rag with tired eyes . " Uncle smelled something , sir , you know ? He told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful after everyone pulled out . I found this in the bushes where the Red River people ? err , relieved themselves , sir , " Gonzalez elaborated , half whispering . He read the semi-literate scrawl by lantern light : " N + W , barn , about 20 gun , yrs trly . " Betrayal . That explains a thing or two . But which one is yrs trly ? Valentine wondered . He remembered a couple of the farmhands had hurried to the bushes as they assembled for the flight to the barn . He had n't thought anything of it at the time : the fear in the night had turned his own bowels to water as well . He gathered three Wolves from downstairs and explained what he wanted to do when the sun came up . Mallow and his reserve platoon arrived shortly before the sun , relieving him of some of the responsibility for the morning 's actions . He suppressed the urge to hug the panting Lugger , who looked as tired as Valentine felt . The Senior Lieutenant heard his report with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? You had some bad luck , rookie . But it could have been worse . Good thing the bastard pulling the strings was n't good enough to work more than one at a time . " Mallow shook his head and offered Valentine a congratulatory swig of busthead from a tiny silver flask . Valentine tippled gratefully , remembering his mother 's warning about men who drank before noon . Well , the sun was n't up yet , so it did n't quite constitute morning . " I think they had a little help , sir . Someone was sending the Hoods love-notes . They knew we 'd make for that barn , brought up the Ravies and had everything ready . " " Aw , Christ , " Mallow groaned . " Some clodhopper thought he 'd be up for a brass ring , huh ? " " Seems like . " " What a welcome to Free Territory . One of their own dangling from a tree . No , I 'll let them handle it back at the Fort . " " I lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Valentine had hoped they would settle for a formal trial later , but the looks on his detail 's faces when he told them why he wanted the farmers searched made him doubtful . Mallow clouded over . " They 'll obey orders , Valentine , or they 'll see some quick justice . Tell ' em that , if you must . " " Yessir . " Mallow stepped inside the barn . The sky to the east was pinking , ending the longest night of Valentine 's young life . He nodded to his waiting Wolves , and they roused the sleepy farmers and began checking pockets and packs . They had barely begun when the guilty party revealed himself . A sixteen-year-old boy , the one whose mother was bitten last night , bolted for the gaping south doors . Two of Mallow 's Wolves interposed and restrained him . Valentine found a charcoal pencil wrapped in two more rags of cloth , as well as a small compass . " A kid , whaddaya know , " one of the men sighed . A couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curses in between sobs . His ashen-faced father held his distraught wife . She already trembled with the weakness of the first stage of the disease that would claim her life within two or three more days , when she would have to be shot like a rabid dog . Mallow and Patel ignored the grieving parents and questioned the boy in time-honored good cop/bad cop fashion . " Who put you up to this , boy ? " Mallow asked , leaning to put his face below the boy 's downcast eyes . " What did they promise you ? If it were up to this guy here , he 'd snap your neck with his good arm . I ca n't help you unless you talk to me . Tell you what , you leave another note , only write on it what we tell you , and you wo n't get hung . Ca n't promise anything else , but you wo n't hang . " The boy 's fear exploded into anger . " You do n't get it , do you ? They 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they run the show . An ' when they get tired of you , you 'll be emptied an ' the Grogs 'll have the leftovers ! Them that do n't want to die got ta go along with orders . " Valentine , sick with fatigue , stepped outside to watch the dawn . As the yellow-orange sun burned through the morning haze , he wondered what doom of fate had selected him to be born into such a fucked-up time .
