The fog rolled through the Golden Gate and billowed across the dark waters of the bay . Tendrils of mist eased into coves and inlets , embraced hills and tall city buildings and , impelled by a brisk offshore breeze , worked its way into the Oakland Estuary and swept onto the streets of the waterfront . Jeremiah Ignatius McElroy felt the first cold draft against his back and shivered as though someone had poured ice water down his collar . It had been an unseasonably warm spring day , the temperatures climbing into the mid-80s , and a pleasant early evening , but this blast of damp cold air had lowered the thermometer a good thirty degrees . Now as clammy mist swirled around him and brought the deep bellow of foghorns from out in the bay , Jeremiah cursed himself for not bringing a coat . He was lightly clad in a buckskin jacket , denim jeans , and boots , hatless , but with his favorite buck knife strapped to his belt in its Indian bead scabbard . Jeremiah flapped his arms and quickened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lean and tough as beef jerky , offered him little natural insulation from sudden cold . His graying black hair , thin and receding in the front , long and curly in the back , with thick sideburns merging into a scruffy beard , was now damp and matted to his skin . Jeremiah knew this dank weather was just the thing to bring on a crippling attack of rheumatism . He flapped his arms harder and moved at a semi-jog . Jeremiah turned the corner and bright light , loud music , and jeering laughter greeted him from across the street in front of the Last Chance Saloon . Two young hoodlums in tight suits and derby hats were lounging on the porch , hand-rolled cigarettes dangling from their lips , their eyes glittering from too much cheap booze , pointing toward Jeremiah as though he were a circus animal . Jeremiah was going to ignore them and walk on past until the larger of the two , who Jeremiah figured was sizing him up as a possible roll , called out , " Hey , Billy , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to git off the ground . Now ai n't that a sight . " " Yeah , he s a sight all right , " said Billy . " Get a look at them clothes . " The other one laughed and said , " Hey , old man , whered you git those clothes ? A museum ? " " Naw , Rube , he did nt git those clothes from no museum . Why , I think he must be one of them cowboys from Buffalo Bills Wild West Show . " Jeremiah clenched his fists and tightened his lips . His ears and neck were burning . He felt the old familiar rush of adrenaline , the dryness in his throat , the coppery taste on his tongue , and the tingling of his scalp . He stopped in front of a chandlers shop and turned to face the men , his hazel eyes narrowed , his right hand slipping into the inside pocket of his jacket . " Is that the story , old man ? " continued Rube . " Or are you Buffalo Bill himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop and into the street to a pool of light cast by the bar . Then in a soft voice , his eyes glued to the men , he said , " No , boys , you got that wrong . I was around before anyone ever heard of Bill Cody . And Ill probably still be here when you cheap tinhorns get whats comin to you . Now git . You boys are botherin me . " " Well , listen to the old fool , " said Rube , grabbing one of the porch support beams and lurching a step forward . " I guess you . . . " A lightning movement and a flash of metal ended in a solid thud . A whittling knife , still vibrating , was impaled in the post about an inch above Rubes hand . Rube froze , his face pale and his eyes wide . Jeremiah pulled his buck knife and held it so that the light glinted off its polished surface . The two men stared at it . Jeremiah twirled the carved ivory handle and then held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case I still need to tell you . . . you need to be careful who you trifle with . . . " " Hell , mister , we were just havin a little fun . Theres no need to . . . " " Im not through talking , boy . " Billy dropped his eyes . " Now , as I was saying , I might look a little long in the tooth , but that do nt mean this old boy still do nt have fangs . I mean , Ive thrown this here buck knife through both man and beast and , well , for a minute there you had me thinking of doing something like that to you boys . Shoot , its not right to disrespect your elders . But then , thinking about it , a more righteous punishment for two young dumb boys like yourselves would be to , well . . . Im highly tempted to just cut off your peckers so you do nt breed anymore jackasses like yourselves . . . . You catch my drift ? " Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Adios , boys . And I mean now . " The two hoods turned and slunk into the depths of the saloon . Jeremiah , chuckling , went to retrieve his knife . He felt great now . All thoughts of the cold had disappeared . Sure , maybe he wasnt what he had been , but he could still intimidate a couple of fresh young bucks who thought he was an easy touch . Jeremiah put a little extra swagger in his walk as he continued up the street another block and turned into the St. Louis House . Jeremiah pushed through the swinging doors and was engulfed in smoke , noise , and the resinous odor of the sawdust scattered across the plank floor . The large barroom was filled with an assortment of longshoremen , wharf rats , oyster pirates , and a handful of professional ladies who doubled as barmaids . The walls at the back of the room were adorned with paintings of pioneers heading west interspersed with the heads of a big horn sheep , a buffalo , a grizzly , and a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the long bar , was decorated with a stuffed shark head , a swordfish , a narwhal , and various harpoons , nets , and other fishing paraphernalia . A gas-lit chandelier hung from the rafters and booths occupied the sides of the room along with stairwells leading to the second floor . For a moment , Jeremiah considered squeezing in along the packed bar , but then he spotted an open table next to the potbelly stove in the back and he opted for that . He had no sooner sat down , fired up his pipe , and begun to feel a warm glow on his back from the stove , when Jennie McDermott came up to him . She was balancing a tray loaded with schooners of steam beer in her right hand and had a wicked grin on her lips and a mischievous look in her eyes . " Well , well , if it isnt ol Jeremiah McElroy himself . Warming his creaky bones by that stove like an old cat . " Jeremiah looked up and smiled at the buxom , good-natured woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to her , Jeremiah slipped comfortably into the Irish brogue of his youth . " Well now , girl , Ill have you speak to me with a wee bit more respect . I just had a little run-in with some young lads who confused old with seasoned . " " Did you now ? And what was the result ? " " It wasnt to their credit . And Ill have you know , lass , on a good night I can still give you the shagging of your life . " Jennie laughed , slopping some of the foam off the top of the beers , and replied , " And would this be a good night for you , laddie ? " " Surely you mean , would this be a good night for you , girl ? " " Ah , but youre a conceited one Jeremiah Ignatius Mc-Elroy . But its good to see a man of your advanced years with so much wit and vinegar . " " Thank you , daughter . And as for lying by the stove on a night such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Sam Clemens when he said , The coldest winter I ever spent was summer in San Francisco . " " Surely . But were in Oakland . Are you unable to tell the difference now ? " " Its of little difference , lass . " " Of little difference , is it ? Then its certain you need a whisky to clear the fog out of your brain , then . " " I cant dispute that . " " Whisky with a beer chaser , Mac ? " " No . Just the whisky for now . The good stuff from Danny Boys private reserve . " " Its coming up . " While Jennie went to fetch his drink , Jeremiah went to the complimentary buffet table and filled a large plate with slabs of roast turkey , Spanish olives , sourdough bread , oysters , which he squirted with red pepper sauce , and cheese . Then he found a current edition of William Randolph Hearsts San Francisco Examiner , dated Sunday , May 10 , 1891 , and opened it to the " Prattle " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had served together in the Army of the Cumberland during the Civil War and , perhaps in part because of this shared fraternity , Jeremiah had a keen appreciation for the vitriolic wit and biting satire of " Bitter Bierces " columns and stories . Jeremiah sipped his whisky , forked down his food , and savored Bierces skewering of President Benjamin Harrison who was touring California . Jeremiah read : " Respect ! Respect the good . Respect the wise . Respect the dead . Let the president look to it that he belongs to one of these classes . His going about the country in gorgeous state and barbaric splendor as the guest of a thieving corporation , but at our expense , whining and dining and swining , unsouling himself of clotted nonsense in pickled platitudes calculated for the meridian of Coon Hollow , Indiana , but ingeniously adapted to each water tank on the line of his absurd progress does not prove it , and the presumption of his good office is against him . . . " Jeremiah laughed , took another sip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also served as an officer in the Army of the Cumberland during the Civil War . Even then he had a reputation among the troops as a shameless self-promoter with a bloated ego . Harrison had been far more popular with politicians and newspapermen than with the ordinary enlisted men . Jeremiah had disliked him in those days ; Bierce had loathed him . Jeremiah slurped down a couple of oysters and took up the paper again . " . . . Can you not see , poor misguided fellow citizens , how you permit your political taskmasters to forge leg chains of your follies and load you down with them ! Will nothing teach you that all this fuss-and-feathers , all this ceremony , all this official gorgeousness and brass-banding , this manifestation of a proper respect for the nations head , this monkey business , has no decent place in American life and American politics ? Will no experience open your stupid eyes to the fact that these shows are but absurd imitations of royalty to hold you silly , while you are plundered by the managers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and sustain them by the ascending current of your senseless hurrahs , the programmers are going through your blessed pockets and exploiting your holy dollars ? No ; you feel secure : Power is of the people , and you can effect a change of robbers every four years . Inestimable privilegeto pull off the glutted leach and attach the lean one ! And you can not even choose among the lean leaches , but must accept those designated by the programmers and showmen who have the reptiles on tap . " Jeremiah took another slug of whisky and chuckled , thinking , ol Ambrose is in rare form here . Then he continued : " . . . Men who believed before that Mr. Harrison was a small-minded vulgarian , imperfectly honest , imperfectly intelligent , profoundly selfish , and conspicuously ill-bred , the willing servitor of robber corporations and political adventurers , believe so still . . . " " Mr. McElroy ! May I have a word with you , sir ? " interrupted a deep melodious voice .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
