PRELUDE TO A NUMBER // Numberless are the world 's wonders. - Sophocles ( 495-405 b.c. ) // The famous British physicist Lord Kelvin ( William Thomson ; 1824-1907 ) , after whom the degrees in the absolute temperature scale are named , once said in a lecture : " When you can not express it in numbers , your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind . " Kelvin was referring , of course , to the knowledge required for the advancement of science . But numbers and mathematics have the curious propensity of contributing even to the understanding of things that are , or at least appear to be , extremely remote from science . In Edgar Allan Poe 's The Mystery of Marie Roget , the famous detective Auguste Dupin says : " We make chance a matter of absolute calculation . We subject the unlooked for and unimagined , to the mathematical formulae of the schools . " At an even simpler level , consider the following problem you may have encountered when preparing for a party : You have a chocolate bar composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to separate all the pieces ? The answer is actually much simpler than you might have thought , and it does not require almost any calculation . Every time you make a snap , you have one more piece than you had before . Therefore , if you need to end up with twelve pieces , you will have to snap eleven times . ( Check it for yourself . ) More generally , irrespective of the number of pieces the chocolate bar is composed of , the number of snaps is always one less than the number of pieces you need . // Even if you are not a chocolate lover yourself , you realize that this example demonstrates a simple mathematical rule that can be applied to many other circumstances . But in addition to mathematical properties , formulae , and rules ( many of which we forget anyhow ) , there also exist a few special numbers that are so ubiquitous that they never cease to amaze us . The most famous of these is the number pi ( ? ) , which is the ratio of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pi , 3.14159 . . . , has fascinated many generations of mathematicians . Even though it was defined originally in geometry , pi appears very frequently and unexpectedly in the calculation of probabilities . A famous example is known as Buffon 's Needle , after the French mathematician George-Louis Leclerc , Comte de Buffon ( 1707-1788 ) , who posed and solved this probability problem in 1777 . Leclerc asked : Suppose you have a large sheet of paper on the floor , ruled with parallel straight lines spaced by a fixed distance . A needle of length equal precisely to the spacing between the lines is thrown completely at random onto the paper . What is the probability that the needle will land in such a way that it will intersect one of the lines ( e.g. , as in Figure 1 ) ? Surprisingly , the answer turns out to be the number 2/ ? . Therefore , in principle , you could even evaluate ? by repeating this experiment many times and observing in what fraction of the total number of throws you obtain an intersection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the value of pi . ) Pi has by now become such a household word that film director Darren Aronofsky was even inspired to make a 1998 intellectual thriller with that title . // Less known than pi is another number , phi ( f ) , which is in many respects even more fascinating . Suppose I ask you , for example : What do the delightful petal arrangement in a red rose , Salvador Dali 's famous painting " Sacrament of the Last Supper , " the magnificent spiral shells of mollusks , and the breeding of rabbits all have in common ? Hard to believe , but these very disparate examples do have in common a certain number or geometrical proportion known since antiquity , a number that in the nineteenth century was given the honorifics " Golden Number , " " Golden Ratio , " and " Golden Section . " A book published in Italy at the beginning of the sixteenth century went so far as to call this ratio the " Divine Proportion . " // In everyday life , we use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of things with respect to size or quantity or when we want to describe a harmonious relationship between different parts . In mathematics , the term " proportion " is used to describe an equality of the type : nine is to three as six is to two . As we shall see , the Golden Ratio provides us with an intriguing mingling of the two definitions in that , while defined mathematically , it is claimed to have pleasingly harmonious qualities . // The first clear definition of what has later become known as the Golden Ratio was given around 300 b.c. by the founder of geometry as a formalized deductive system , Euclid of Alexandria . We shall return to Euclid and his fantastic accomplishments in Chapter 4 , but at the moment let me note only that so great is the admiration that Euclid commands that , in 1923 , the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote a poem entitled " Euclid Alone Has Looked on Beauty Bare . " Actually , even Millay 's annotated notebook from her course in Euclidean geometry has been preserved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line into what he called its " extreme and mean ratio . " In Euclid 's words : // A straight line is said to have been cut in extreme and mean ratio when , as the whole line is to the greater segment , so is the greater to the lesser . // In other words , if we look at Figure 2 , line AB is certainly longer than the segment AC ; at the same time , the segment AC is longer than CB . If the ratio of the length of AC to that of CB is the same as the ratio of AB to AC , then the line has been cut in extreme and mean ratio , or in a Golden Ratio . // Who could have guessed that this innocent-looking line division , which Euclid defined for some purely geometrical purposes , would have consequences in topics ranging from leaf arrangements in botany to the structure of galaxies containing billions of stars , and from mathematics to the arts ? The Golden Ratio therefore provides us with a wonderful example of that feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1879-1955 ) valued so much . In Einstein 's own words : " The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious . It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and science . He who knows it not and can no longer wonder , no longer feel amazement , is as good as dead , a snuffed-out candle . " // As we shall see calculated in this book , the precise value of the Golden Ratio ( the ratio of AC to CB in Figure 2 ) is the never-ending , never-repeating number 1.6180339887 . . . , and such never-ending numbers have intrigued humans since antiquity . One story has it that when the Greek mathematician Hippasus of Metapontum discovered , in the fifth century b.c. , that the Golden Ratio is a number that is neither a whole number ( like the familiar 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . ) nor even a ratio of two whole numbers ( like the fractions 1/2 , 2/3 , 3/4 , . . . ; known collectively as rational numbers ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pythagoras ( the Pythagoreans ) . The Pythagorean worldview ( which will be described in detail in Chapter 2 ) was based on an extreme admiration for the arithmos-the intrinsic properties of whole numbers or their ratios-and their presumed role in the cosmos . The realization that there exist numbers , like the Golden Ratio , that go on forever without displaying any repetition or pattern caused a true philosophical crisis . Legend even claims that , overwhelmed with this stupendous discovery , the Pythagoreans sacrificed a hundred oxen in awe , although this appears highly unlikely , given the fact that the Pythagoreans were strict vegetarians . I should emphasize at this point that many of these stories are based on poorly documented historical material . The precise date for the discovery of numbers that are neither whole nor fractions , known as irrational numbers , is not known with any certainty . Nevertheless , some researchers do place the discovery in the fifth century b.c. , which is at least consistent with the dating of the stories just described . What is clear is that the Pythagoreans basically believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must represent some sort of cosmic error , one that should be suppressed and kept secret . // The fact that the Golden Ratio can not be expressed as a fraction ( as a rational number ) means simply that the ratio of the two lengths AC and CB in Figure 2 can not be expressed as a fraction . In other words , no matter how hard we search , we can not find some common measure that is contained , let 's say , 31 times in AC and 19 times in CB . Two such lengths that have no common measure are called incommensurable . The discovery that the Golden Ratio is an irrational number was therefore , at the same time , a discovery of incommensurability . In On the Pythagorean Life ( ca. a.d. 300 ) , the philosopher and historian Iamblichus , a descendant of a noble Syrian family , describes the violent reaction to this discovery : // They say that the first human to disclose the nature of commensurability and incommensurability to those unworthy to share in the theory was so hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common association and way of life , but even his tomb was built , as if their former colleague was departed from life among humankind. // In the professional mathematical literature , the common symbol for the Golden Ratio is the Greek letter tau ( from the Greek solag , to-mi , which means " the cut " or " the section " ) . However , at the beginning of the twentieth century , the American mathematician Mark Barr gave the ratio the name of phi , the first Greek letter in the name of Phidias , the great Greek sculptor who lived around 490 to 430 b.c . Phidias ' greatest achievements were the " Athena Parthenos " in Athens and the " Zeus " in the temple of Olympia . He is traditionally also credited with having been in charge of other Parthenon sculptures , although it is quite probable that many were actually made by his students and assistants . Barr decided to honor the sculptor because a number of art historians maintained that Phidias had made frequent and meticulous use of the Golden Ratio in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this book . ) I will use the names Golden Ratio , Golden Section , Golden Number , phi , and also the symbol interchangeably throughout , because these are the names most frequently encountered in the recreational mathematics literature . // Some of the greatest mathematical minds of all ages , from Pythagoras and Euclid in ancient Greece , through the medieval Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa and the Renaissance astronomer Johannes Kepler , to present-day scientific figures such as Oxford physicist Roger Penrose , have spent endless hours over this simple ratio and its properties . But the fascination with the Golden Ratio is not confined just to mathematicians . Biologists , artists , musicians , historians , architects , psychologists , and even mystics have pondered and debated the basis of its ubiquity and appeal . In fact , it is probably fair to say that the Golden Ratio has inspired thinkers of all disciplines like no other number in the history of mathematics . // An immense amount of research , in particular by the Canadian mathematician and author Roger Herz-Fischler ( described in his excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been devoted even just to the simple question of the origin of the name " Golden Section . " Given the enthusiasm that this ratio has generated since antiquity , we might have thought that the name also has ancient origins . Indeed , some authoritative books on the history of mathematics , like Frankois Lasserre 's The Birth of Mathematics in the Age of Plato , and Carl B. Boyer 's A History of Mathematics , place the origin of this name in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , respectively . This , however , appears not to be the case . As far as I can tell from reviewing much of the historical fact-finding effort , this term was first used by the German mathematician Martin Ohm ( brother of the famous physicist Georg Simon Ohm , after whom Ohm 's law in electromagnetism is named ) , in the 1835 second edition of his book Die Reine Elementar-Mathematik ( The pure elementary mathematics ) . Ohm writes in a footnote : " One also customarily calls this division of an arbitrary line in two such parts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the impression that he did not invent the term himself but rather used a commonly accepted name . Yet the fact that he did not use it in the first edition of his book ( published in 1826 ) suggests at least that the name " Golden Section " ( or , in German , " Goldene Schnitt " ) gained its popularity only around the 1830s . The name might have been used orally prior to that , perhaps in nonmathematical circles . There is no question , however , that following Ohm 's book , the term " Golden Section " started to appear frequently and repeatedly in the German mathematical and art history literature . It may have made its debut in English in an article by James Sully on aesthetics , which appeared in the ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1875 . Sully refers to the " interesting experimental enquiry . . . instituted by Gustav Theodor Fechner a physicist and pioneering German psychologist in the nineteenth century into the alleged superiority of ' the golden section ' as a visible proportion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The earliest English uses in a mathematical context appear to have been in an article entitled " The Golden Section " ( by E. Ackermann ) that appeared in 1895 in the American Mathematical Monthly and , around the same time , in the 1898 book Introduction to Algebra by the well-known teacher and author G. Chrystal ( 1851-1911 ) . Just as a curiosity , let me note that the only definition of a " Golden Number " that appears in the 1900 edition of the French encyclopedia Nouveau Larousse Illustre is : " A number used to indicate each of the years of the lunar cycle . " This refers to the position of a calendar year within the nineteen-year cycle after which the phases of the Moon recur on the same dates . Clearly the phrase took a longer time to enter the French mathematical nomenclature . // But what is all the fuss about ? What is it that makes this number , or geometrical proportion , so exciting as to deserve all of this attention ? // The Golden Ratio 's attractiveness stems first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of popping up where it is least expected . // Take , for example , an ordinary apple , the fruit often associated ( probably mistakenly ) with the tree of knowledge that figures so prominently in the biblical account of humankind 's fall from grace , and cut it through its girth . You will find that the apple 's seeds are arranged in a five-pointed star pattern , or pentagram ( Figure 3 ) . //
