<p> Buffalo Sabres winger Miroslav Satan totaled 11 points over four games in the first full week of the new year and still could not earn NHL player of the week honors . <p> As curious as that might read , it is actually quite appropriate for Satan , who might be the NHL 's most anonymous scorer . Over the past season and a half , he has netted 62 goals . That is only one fewer than Teemu Selanne and a few more than Keith Tkachuk has produced and in the neighborhood of John LeClair ( 66 ) . Yet the only real recognition that Satan gets is when the radio hosts use his surname as comic fodder , even though it 's actually pronounced SHUH-tan . <p> Even last June , when the Sabres reached the final , the spotlight found Dominik Hasek and captain Mike Peca moreso than Satan . <p> The low profile might be a reflection of Satan 's game because his strength is his patience , his ability to keep the puck on his stick until precisely the right moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , laughing . " I grew up in a country where players like to hang onto the puck . It is part of our heritage . " <p> Satan is Slovakian . His playing style does not mirror any other player , although coach Lindy Ruff said Satan 's ability to hold the puck is almost Jaromir Jagr-like . " He has ice in his veins . That alone probably gets him 10 goals a year , " Ruff said . <p> Satan is more of a luxury ride than hot rod , although his speed his deceiving , Ruff insisted . <p> " If he gets a step on you on a breakaway , you do n't catch him , " Ruff said . <p> Clearly , Satan is less flamboyant than players such as Paul Kariya , Selanne and Pavel Bure , yet he can sometimes be just as dangerous . Last week 's explosion included a four-point and five-point game . <p> Traditionally , attitude is considered crucial to goal scoring . Scorers usually have a swagger that seems to fuel their performance . Satan does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " He 's pretty strong inside , " Ruff said . " He knows where he can put the puck and what he can do with it . He does have that kind of scoring arrogance . But it 's all on the inside . " <p> Ruff likes Satan 's overall game . <p> " Sometimes he might get criticized for not finishing a check or maybe not wanting to take a hit , " Ruff said . " But a lot of goal-scorers find a way not to get crunched by Derian Hatcher or the other guys so they are still there for the rest of the game . You give and take with some of your premium scorers . " <p> Cast off by Edmonton , Satan concedes " there were doubts " in his mind about whether he would reach his potential in the NHL . But he has taken charge of his career , right down to negotiating his own contract ( $ 4.75 million over two seasons ) last fall instead of using an agent . " I just prefer to sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satan would seem to have the potential to at least flirt with the 50-goal mark someday . But Satan 's goal is far more simplistic . <p> " I want to make the playoffs and have another good run , " Satan said . " We definitely have to play better than we did in the first half . " <p> The rest of the East : <p> Atlanta : D David Harlock will have possible season-ending surgery today on a herniated disk in his neck .

But if I do n't , they 've seen me play . " <p> Boston : C Jason Allison will have surgery to repair a damaged tendon in his right wrist and be out for the season . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but opted for surgery after hurting his thumb . He will have the thumb surgery , then the wrist operation 4-5 weeks later . " Our success has always started from our goaltender out , keeping the puck out of our net , " D Ray Bourque said . " It makes it that much more important , now that one of your offensive guys is going to be out for a while . " <p> Carolina : Owner Peter Karmanos , holding the line on unsigned C Keith Primeau , said he was wrong to offer free agent Sergei Fedorov a six-year , $ 38 million deal two years ago . <p> Florida : Coach Terry Murray thinks RW Pavel Bure 's belief in the Panthers ' system is the key to keeping the club sailing along . " When a star of his caliber buys in , you become like an ocean liner , " Murray said . " It gets going and it ca n't be stopped . The engine can even shut off , but the momentum you have keeps you moving for a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) continues to practice , he has not set a date for his return . " I 'm not sure what the plan is , " coach Alain Vigneault said . " He looks fine on the ice . He 's skating like the wind . I figure he 's got a date in mind and he 'll let us know . " <p> New Jersey : LW Krzysztof Oliwa figures being an NHL tough guy beats working in the coal mines of his native Tychy , Poland , which he did as a teenager .

D Zdeno Chara is expected to be out for four weeks after suffering a minor shoulder separation Monday against Phoenix . <p> N.Y . Rangers : The number of roster changes , mainly through offseason free-agent moves , has affected the Rangers ' cohesiveness . " The main problem is we 're all ex-Montreal Canadiens , or Colorado Avalanches , or something , " coach John Muckler said . " We do n't have chemistry . It 's coming around , but we have to be more consistent . " <p> Ottawa : Without holdout C Alexei Yashin , the Senators had 50 points after 41 games , one fewer than they had at midseason last season . " Alexei was a big part of what we did last year , but I thought we had such a solid foundation that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The difference is we 're more consistent this year . We play hard and most games are close , one- or two-goal games . " <p> Philadelphia : Toronto coach Pat Quinn shook a stick at Flyers coach Roger Neilson during a brawl between their players last month .

" I 'll have to watch to make sure Quinn does n't swing any sticks at me , " Neilson joked . <p> Pittsburgh : Coach Herb Brooks has been experimenting with Alexei Kovalev as first-line center with Jaromir Jagr and Martin Straka . The Jagr-Kovalev duo bears watching . " They could be outstanding , but the chemistry has to be right , " Brooks said . Jagr thinks the change will help Kovalev . " He 's got so much talent , he 's got so much skill , but I think for his good and for the team 's good , he 's got to . . . change his style of hockey , " Jagr said .
