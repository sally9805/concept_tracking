When his uproarious new building , the Experience Music Project , opens later this week in Seattle , it will be easy to forget that Frank Gehry , who is the world 's most famous architect , was once just the world 's most famous strange architect . That was in the 1980s , when to some people his angular rethinking looked all elbows . That was also when his mixture of high concept with cheap materials  --  chain link fencing , corrugated metal , pressed plywood  --  was getting his work labeled " populist , " which generally means brainy but cheap . In 1981 , when he was named Architect of the Year by his peers in California , he figured he should use the opportunity to accept his prize with a talk titled " I 'm Not Weird . " <P> " I was always mentally ducking , " he says now . " People would yell at me and say , ' You ca n't do that . ' " Nobody says no to Gehry anymore , certainly not since the triumph three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hurtling design there was certified at once as " the most important building of our time " by Philip Johnson , the very gray eminence of American architects . It may also be the most purely delightful . With its improbable towers tilting against themselves and its titanium sheathing in full refulgent glow , it brings on a question that the world has not enjoyed asking itself since the first moon landings : If this is possible , what is n't ? <P> The new Guggenheim has also flooded tourists into Bilbao , provided backup curves in a Mariah Carey video and was featured in the most recent James Bond film . What this means is that Gehry has managed to be both intellectually respectable and popular , not just populist , a balancing act that makes his tilted towers look easy . Richard Meier is the great American architect whose stately modernist buildings , most of them in a white so ideal it could be used for the table settings at Plato 's Symposium , are the very opposite of Gehry 's Baroque tumblings . Yet even Meier is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public discussion again . All of a sudden people will say , ' This is architecture . It is not just building . ' " <P> You could say that about the Experience Music Project , Gehry 's first major public building to open in the U.S. since he did Bilbao . Located at the foot of that beloved American knickknack , the Seattle Space Needle , the EMP is an " interactive " rock museum costing $240 million ( more than $100 million for Gehry 's building , the rest for the museum installed within it ) . The money comes by way of Paul Allen , the billionaire Microsoft co-founder , who has his own rock band , a lifelong thing for Seattle native Jimi Hendrix and enough cash to indulge his pleasures in a big way . There may be no bigger way to do that than to hand yourself over to Gehry , whose work is the pleasure principle engraved in stone , twisted glass , titanium and crimson stainless steel . Gehry tells a story about one of a German client who came to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said to me , ' That one was Wow ! Now give us Wow ! Wow ! Wow ! ' "
