" Everybody at school will be listening , " Mads said . " There was that notice in the school paper . And ourannouncement on the blog . " " Everybody in town , too , " Holly said .

" Why did n't we keep this a secret ? I think the nauseo-spazzmosis is infecting my tongue . What if I ca n't speak ? " " Okay , girls , " Mary said . " Ready ? You 're on in five , four , three ... " " Please do n't let us sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're back with American Living on the National Radio Network . I 'm Mary Dando , and today we 're talking to the Dating Game Girls . Madison Markowitz , Holly Anderson , and Lina Ozu are tenth graders at the Rosewood School for Alternative Gifted Education in Carlton Bay , California , and they started a fascinating and very popular Web log on their school site called the Dating Game . Hi , girls . Welcome . Mads , Holly , Lina : Hi , Mary . Holly : Thank you for having us . Mary Dando : You started this site as a project for a sex education class , is that right ? Lina : It 's actually called " Interpersonal Human Development . " Mads : But that 's just a euphemism for sex ed . Holly : Our school is heavily into educational jargon . Mads : We wanted to find out who was more sexcrazed , boys or girls . So we put quizzes and questionnaires on the site , but we did n't get enough answers from boys . That 's when we decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of matchmaking . Mary : So the students fill out a questionnaire about their preferences and you match them with another student for a date ? Holly : Exactly . They can also submit personal ads . But we 're really good at making matches . Mads : Especially Holly . Mary : And what was your conclusion ? Who 's more sex-crazed ? Holly : The results were inconclusive . Mads : But we know the truth . Girls are definitely more sex-crazed . Mary : Girls ? Really ? Mads : Sure . Girls talk about sex all the time . We read about it in magazines . We 're always trying to figure out what boys are thinking . Lina : And gossiping about who did it with who ... Mads : ... and who 's still a virgin and who 's not , and who 's lying about it . Mary : And you do n't think boys are doing the same thing ? Holly : Not as obsessively . They do n't think-they just jump in . Mads : Yeah . Sex is n't on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary : Tell me about the quizzes . What 's a typical subject ? Mads : We just posted a new quiz called " What 's Your Dating Style ? " It helps you figure out if you 're more of a hunter or a prey . Some people think they 're a hunter , but when you look at their behavior , they 're total roadkill . Holly : And we just started a new feature called " XRating . " Mads : Lina came up with the idea when a friend of hers tried to fix her up with one of her exes . Lina : Only I was n't interested . Mary : How does it work ? Holly : It 's part of the matchmaking system . Say you 're still friends with your ex-boyfriend and you think he 'd be great for some girl-Lina : Just not you-Mads : For whatever reason , like maybe you 're a vegetarian and he 's not , but you still think he 's a good person , for a carnivore . Holly : You can write a profile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like as a boyfriend , what his good points are and what kind of girl you think would be good for him . Mads : That way , when a new girl goes out with him , it 's like he has a seal of approval-from his ex-girlfriend . Holly : At least you know he 's not a complete jerk . Lina : Unless he is . You can use " X-Rating " to warn people about someone , too . Mads : But we try to keep it positive , so it wo n't turn into a venge-fest . Mary : It sounds like you 've learned a lot about teens and sex from your blog . What 's the most shocking thing you 've learned ? Lina : Tough one . Mads : I was shocked at first by how many nonvirgins there are in our school . And how young so many kids are the first time they have sex . Mary : How young are they ? Lina : Some kids said thirteen or fourteen . And they say they did all kinds of wild things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were exaggerating . Especially the boys . Mads : Then I got used to the idea , and it stopped shocking me . I 'm unshockable now . Holly : Sure you are , Mads . Lina : I 'm still surprised by how mean some people can be . Mads : Yeah , like how some boys just want to hook up but they do n't really care about you as a person . Mary : What 's the wildest thing you 've ever done ? the girls laugh Holly : I do n't know if we should say it on the air . Mads : People think of us as good girls , but if only they knew ! Lina : Mads ! Our parents are listening ! Mads : But it 's true ! Like that time at Sean 's party-Holly : Mads , do n't say it ! You 'll be sorry later . Mary : Come on , you can tell me . Holly : Let 's just say that that night got out of control . Mads : And Lina-I mean , she seems so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff-Lina : Mads , stop it ! Mads : No one will know what I 'm talking about . I wo n't name names , but one time she liked this guy so much , she hid in his bedroom closet sound muffled because Lina has clapped her hand over Mads ' mouth-Mary : What about you , Holly ? Mads : She pretends to be sensible , but she 's done some wild things-Holly : Mads , you 're the craziest one of us all , so you 'd better stop talking or we 'll tell all your secrets . Lina : Your parents will lock you in your room until you 're thirty . Mads : It 's true , I like to live on the edge . Mary : Thank you , girls . This has been fun . We 'll have to have you back again to give us more insights into the sex lives of America 's teens . Holly : We 'd love to come back anytime . Mary : This is Mary Dando for American Living . Join us tomorrow when we talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's nursing home residents . * * * " Was it bad ? Did I say anything embarrassing ? " Mads asked . She and Lina and Holly got into Holly 's car and drove out of San Francisco . Their town , Carlton Bay , was about an hour north of the city . " I ca n't remember anything that happened in there . It 's all a blur . " " Do n't worry , " Lina said . " Ramona said she 'd tape it . She was hoping to catch us saying something super-dumb on live radio . " " I think she 'll be disappointed , " Holly said . " I do n't think we said anything super-dumb . " " No , maybe just normal-dumb , " Lina said . " Normal-dumb , " Mads said . " I guess I can live with that . " " You were great today , honey , " Mads ' father said when she returned home . Russell Markowitz rubbed his messy Brillo pad of gray hair in a way that told Mads " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her mother , M.C. , whose smile was wide but tight . M.C. , a **27;876;TOOLONG , was eccentric and creative and earthy but had the fierce maternal instincts of a she-wolf . Russell , a labor lawyer , was liberal and protective at the same time . It caused some tension in the house . Mads ' parents wanted to allow and prohibit everything at once . " Mmm-hmm , " M.C. said . " You all sounded very articulate , and , um , lively- " " Like you were really having a good time in the studio , " Russell said . " Thanks , " Mads said . " It was fun . But I was so nervous . " " You sounded like sluts , " Audrey , Mads ' eleven-year-old sister , said . " Audrey ! " M.C. scolded . " That 's what you said ! " Audrey cried . M.C. turned red . " I did n't mean it , " M.C. said . " It 's just-I did n't realize- " " We 're proud of you , " Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your feelings . We think you should be free to express yourself any way you like . It 's just- " " If only it were n't so-so- " M.C. fumbled for the right word . " So public . " " She means embarrassing , " Audrey said . Mads could n't believe this . " Embarrassing ! Mom , you 're the one who wrote a whole play about how you got ESP ! That was embarrassing . " " The Crier did n't think so , " Audrey said . " They said it was ' thought-provoking . ' And they loved my acting in it . They said I was- " " ' A twinkling little star in the making , ' " Mads finished . She 'd heard that quote from the local paper 's review of M.C. 's play , Touched , about a hundred times too many already . It was taped to Audrey 's bedroom door . " Honey , do n't take this the wrong way . " M.C. put her arm around Mads . " We 're proud of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ... sexy . " " Well , what do you think we learn about in IHD ? " Mads said . " Microwave Cookery ? " " Do n't worry , honey , " Russell said . " We just have to get used to thinking of you as a- " " A sexual being , " M.C. finished . " Mom ! Gross ! " Audrey said . " I was going to say ' growing young lady , ' " Russell said . " But your mother is right . No reason to tiptoe around it . " " Maybe we just should n't talk about it at all , " Mads said . " How does that sound ? " She went up to her room . " We really do think you did a great job , though ! " M.C. called up after her . Mads slammed her bedroom door and flopped onto her bed . Her nauseo-spazzmosis was back with a vengeance . Stupid parents , she thought . What do they know ? I bet everybody at school thought the interview was excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , maybe not that great . But good . Still , her mother 's words echoed in her mind . Or rather , Audrey 's version of her mother 's words : " You sounded like sluts . " Did they ? Did everybody in town think so , too ? Or was her mother being overly sensitive , as usual ? Overly sensitive , Mads decided . It was the obvious choice . The only choice that left her dignity intact . She logged onto the Dating Game and checked the inbox for new mail . Nothing . It was too soon , she knew . The interview had only aired that day . But Mads could n't wait . She was dying to know . What did everybody think ? ( Continues ... )
