<p> For four years , companies hoping to sell stock to the public for the first time have found the doors all but shut . Stung by the dot-com disaster , shareholders were not buying and young companies stopped trying . <p> Now the doors are opening a crack again . More initial public offerings were completed in the first seven months of this year than in any of the previous three years . <p> There is more to the resurgence than the approaching market debut of Google Inc . Successful offerings by Blackboard Inc. of the District and TNS Inc. of Reston have reverberated through the Washington technology community . <p> Investors considering the new IPOs might draw some lessons from the boom years . <p> In 1999 , a high-water mark for local IPOs and the midpoint of the Internet stock bubble , 21 companies in Maryland , Virginia and the District went public . Nearly all were enthusiastically received by investors , at least at their starts . <p> Six are no longer in business , seven were sold and eight continue to operate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst survival rate . Many of those still alive struggled with layoffs and disappointing earnings . A few tossed out their original business strategies and aimed for different markets . Some just disappeared . <p> " What happened , as ' 99 wore on , is that the bar got lower and lower , " said Raul J. Fernandez , founder and former chief executive of Proxicom Inc. , a Reston-based Web development company that went public in 1999 . " It was a unique moment in time , the good and bad did get to go out . And the companies that had good fundamentals were acquired or are still around . " <p> Among the surviving IPOs of 1999 , the most successful  --  Corporate Executive Board Co. , Trex Co. , XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. and United Therapeutics Corp .  --  have one thing in common : limited dependence on the Internet . <p> Most have old-fashioned business models . They offered tangible products or services , and they collected tangible payments in return . <p> Take two companies in the old-line business of radio , Radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District . <p> Radio One owned 26 stations targeting minority listeners when it went public under the command of Catherine L. Hughes and her son Alfred C. Liggins III . Radio One raised $152.2 million through its IPO in May 1999 , and its stock price rose 40 percent in the first day of trading . <p> Such first-day pops , some of them far bigger , were typical in 1999 . Unlike many companies with similar debuts , though , Radio One continued to grow . The company now owns more than 65 stations and posted a $53.8 million profit on $303.2 in revenue for 2003 . <p> XM 's plan was riskier . The company had no customers and no revenue when it went public in October 1999 . But it had a product consumers and investors could understand : dozens of commercial-free radio channels beamed into a car for a monthly fee . <p> " We were offering a unique entertainment product , " said Hugh Panero , XM 's president and chief executive . " That really resonated with investors . " <p> XM raised $120 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched its product , a $10-a-month radio service . So far , 2 million customers have signed up . But despite strong revenue growth , XM is unprofitable . In 2003 , it lost $585 million on revenue of $92 million . <p> Few biotechnology companies ever develop a marketable medicine and fewer still are profitable . So United Therapeutics Corp . of Silver Spring did everything it could to minimize risk to investors , waiting until it had several drugs in advanced human testing before it went public . " The risk of failure falls the further you go along , and we were pretty far along , " said Fred T. Hadeed , chief financial officer . <p> One of the company 's experimental drugs , a treatment for a rare lung disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension , won federal approval in 2002 . Sales soared from $5.7 million in 2001 to $53.3 million in 2003 , 90 percent of which came from the treatment , called Remodulin . Hadeed predicted that the company will become profitable this year . <p> One of the few Web-based companies to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The McLean banking and bill payment company , founded in 1989 , moved its services to the Web as consumers began to use the Internet . Still , when it went public in June 1999 , investors and analysts criticized the company for being too rooted in " old economy " ways , chief executive Matthew P. Lawlor said . <p> " Then it was a land grab  --  sign as many banks as you can . Paint as pretty picture as you possibly can , " Lawlor said . Online Resources ' public offering was less than stunning ; the company raised $38.5 million selling stock at $14 a share . <p> After the bubble burst , Online Resources was grouped with other dot-coms , Lawlor said . He spent much of his time convincing clients that it was not on the verge of extinction . <p> " I should n't ever be one to complain about the Internet bubble , but when it did bust it could be very demoralizing , " Lawlor said . <p> Online Resources reported an 18.5 percent increase in revenue and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully rebounded . Its stock closed Friday at $6.30 a share . <p> The IPOs of 1999 that failed lacked one feature : paying customers . <p> LifeMinders Inc. sent users e-mail messages to help them keep track of their busy lives . In classic dot-com style , the company did not charge for its services , relying instead on advertising for revenue . With 3 million users and no profit in sight , the Herndon company went public in November 1999 . Its stock debuted at $14 a share and rose 60 percent on the first day of trading . The company raised $58.9 million through its IPO . <p> The company bought a pricey Super Bowl ad , held a secondary offering that raised $86 million in February 2000 and announced plans to acquire a wireless messaging company for $24 million  --  just a month after posting a $13.7 million loss for the second quarter of 2000 . <p> Then the online advertising market crashed . Advertising revenue , which reached $17 million in the third quarter of 2000 , fell to $2 million by the second quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Alison H. Abraham , the company 's former president . " It was clear we could no longer operate as a stand-alone business . " <p> By January 2001 , the company had ousted its founder and chief executive , begun layoffs among its staff of 200 and told investors it was dropping its efforts to enter the wireless sector . Its loss ballooned to $70.5 million in the last quarter of 2000 . <p> LifeMinders ' stock traded at just over a dollar during the summer of 2001 , and the company 's headcount dwindled to 30 . In October of that year its assets were acquired by New York-based Cross Media Marketing Corp . in a cash and stock deal worth about $58.1 million . <p> Value America Inc. , a Charlottesville online retailer that raised $126.5 million in an April 1999 IPO , suffered a similar fate . The company 's goal was to become the Wal-Mart of the Internet , a one-stop shop where people could buy anything and everything . <p> Shares of its stock started trading at $23 and were driven up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teens within two months . Sales did not keep pace with investments in marketing and staff . The firm lost $143.5 million in 1999 . <p> In August 2000 Value America filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . Its assets were sold in November 2000 for $2.4 million . <p> MusicMaker.com Inc. raised $67 million in its initial public offering . Its business plan : Customers could pick songs from a Web site , then employees would copy them onto compact discs to be mailed to the buyer . During its first year on the market , the company 's stock hit a split-adjusted high of $239 . <p> While MusicMaker.com paid record companies to use their songs , Napster and other file-swapping programs popped up , ignoring the rules and providing free instant access to music . <p> In January 2001 , MusicMaker 's shareholders voted to liquidate the firm . After selling much of the company 's equipment at auction , MusicMaker announced that it would distribute $3 a share . <p> Not all companies died in dramatic flameouts . CAIS Internet Inc. , which initially sold broadband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 . It began selling parts of its business , rotated through three chief executives and in July 2001 changed its name to Ardent Communications Inc . <p> With less than $1 million in the bank , the District company filed for Chapter 11 protection in October 2001 and slowly began to sell its assets . The Hong Kong company that bought a list of old CAIS e-mail subscribers shut down the service in January this year . <p> Thriving or dying were not the only alternatives . Some in the IPO class of ' 99 were acquired . <p> Proxicom , for example , is still in business , though it bears little resemblance to the firm that went public five years ago . The Web development company was already one of the Washington area 's brightest stars when it raised $57.3 million in an April 1999 IPO . <p> After winning a bidding war with Compaq Computer Corp. , South Africa-based Dimension Data acquired Proxicom for $448 million . For the firm 's original employees and stockholders who cashed out it was a big payday . Founder Fernandez has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the company . <p> But demand for its online business services plunged soon after the sale . Its workforce dropped from 2,000 employees to fewer than 150 . In March it was sold to Gores Technology Group LLC , a buyout firm based in Los Angeles . In June Proxicom announced that it readopted its old name and brand . <p> CareerBuilder Inc. is no longer publicly traded , but the online recruiting company still exists . The Reston company was acquired in July 2000 by newspaper chains Knight Ridder Inc. and Tribune Co. for about $250 million and acquired one of its biggest competitors , HeadHunter.net , for about $200 million in late 2001 . Gannett Co. joined Knight Ridder and Tribune in October 2002 . Today CareerBuilder is a help-wanted portal for all three newspaper companies . <p> An expensive acquisition also paid off well for investors of AppNet Systems Inc . The Bethesda company , which builds e-commerce systems for businesses , was bought by Commerce One in June 2000 in a stock deal then worth about $2 billion . <p> " We were one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ken S. Bajaj , AppNet 's founder . <p> " There were a few people who threatened to sue me because they thought it was too cheap , " Bajaj said . He does n't hear that anymore . In late 2001 , with demand for online services plummeting , Commerce One began carving up AppNet 's assets for resale .
