Everything you need to know about the season 's releases , including CDs from a Boss , a Kid , and two Idols . Plus , the 10 most exciting acts on the face of the planet . 30 Hottest New Albums October Brooks &; Dunn Cowboy Town October 2 Do n't be fooled . The duo 's hit " Proud of the House We Built " celebrates long-term faithfulness and domesticity in a manner country radio loves . But the CD is mostly a soundtrack for sowing wild oats , from its honky-tonky anthems to its surprisingly Stonesy guitar riffs . Dashboard Confessional The Shade of Poison Trees October 2 Emo overlord Chris Carrabba returns with a disc recorded in just 10 days with producer Don Gilmore ( Avril Lavigne , Linkin Park ) . Shade boasts his usual barbed sentiments , as on " Where There 's Gold ... "  --  whose ellipsis ends , " there 's a gold digger . " Annie Lennox Songs of Mass Destruction October 2 The new CD by the ex-Eurythmic features the ambitious " Sing , " a feminist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etheridge to Fergie . Bruce Springsteen &; The E Street Band Magic October 2 If you were heartened that the Boss reunited the E Street Band in the studio for 2002 's The Rising , but slightly disappointed that it did n't totally sound like them , your prayers have been answered . The celebrative band vibe of Springsteen 's 15th studio album unmistakably harkens back to landmarks like The River . Band of Horses Cease to Begin October 9 The pastoral , beard-y rockers , whose majestic 2006 debut , Everything All the Time , became a sleeper hit , return with an intimate , countrified follow-up produced by Phil Ek ( Built to Spill , Modest Mouse ) . Vanessa Carlton Heroes &; Thieves October 9 Since 2004 's Harmonium , Carlton has run the New York City Marathon and jogged into the welcoming corporate arms of hip-hop label Murder Inc . The latter 's chief , Irv Gotti , was on hand when the singer recently performed tracks from this third CD for EW in her Manhattan apartment . However , it is the influence of mentor Stevie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the single " Lolita Fairytale . " Jennifer Lopez Brave October 9 Jennifer Lopez feels like shakin ' what her mama gave her . Or at least that 's how it seems based on the dance-friendly Brave , her sixth album and second of the year following April 's Spanish-language Como Ama una Mujer . Highlights include lead single " Do It Well " and the Latin-flavored " Hold It ! Do n't Drop It ! " Robert Plant / Alison Krauss Raising Sand October 23 The upcoming , Ahmet Ertegun-honoring Led Zep reunion is not a huge surprise . A CD-length collaboration between rock god Plant and bluegrass queen Krauss ? Much more so . But , in covering the likes of Tom Waits , the Everly Brothers , and Doc Watson , the harmonizing pair have discovered an unlikely , but lovely , middle ground . The Thrills Teenager October 23 The Thrills have been delighting fans of jangly , ultra-melodic indie rock since their debut in 2003 Now on their third studio effort , the Irish band return with more sweet , mandolinicious ditties to tug at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the song " Nothing Changes Around Here " so appropriate  --  but in their case , that 's a good , even thrilling , thing . Carrie Underwood Carnival Ride October 23 Though the instant country superstar only co-wrote one tune on her smash debut , she helped pen four this time , including first single " So Small . " Other tracks include a remake of Randy Travis ' " I Told You So , " " Wheel of the World " ( which provides the album 's title imagery ) , and " Just a Dream " ( about a dying soldier and his fiance ) . Avenged Sevenfold Avenged Sevenfold October 30 Metalcore went mainstream in 2005 with Avenged Sevenfold 's MTV smash " Bat Country , " and the Southern California band continues to trip the dark fantastic on this self-titled release , a blur of punishing guitars and menacing vocals . Backstreet Boys Unbreakable October 30 Pop 's most enduring boy band , Backstreet is back  --  minus Kevin Richardson  --  with another album 's worth of teary ballads . Craving a reprise of 2005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for a spin and get those tissues ready . Levon Helm Dirt Farmer October 30 Helm owned one of rock 's most beautifully sad voices even before having to endure both a battle with throat cancer and the 1999 death of fellow Band member Rick Danko . Predictably , the drummer 's first solo studio album in 25 years  --  which includes a cover of Steve Earle 's " The Mountain "  --  is not lacking in perfectly honed country-folk mournfulness . I 'm Not There Various Artists October 30 How many acts must a man  --  in this case director Todd Haynes  --  put on the soundtrack of a Dylan biopic ? The answer , my friends , is a lot : Jeff Tweedy , Sonic Youth , Karen O , Mason Jennings , Eddie Vedder , Cat Power , Jack Johnson , Willie Nelson ... Bob himself , meanwhile , is there in the form of a 1967 recording of the title track . November Chris Brown Exclusive November 6 Having just turned 18 ( ! ) , Brown is definitely feeling friskier on his sophomore disc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least lust  --  on his mind with songs like the T-Pain-featuring " Kiss Kiss , " and the slow-jammerific " Take You Down . " And despite assists from producers will.i.am and Swizz Beatz , Brown pulls his weight by writing seven tracks . Look who 's a big boy now ! Nicole Scherzinger Her Name Is Nicole November 6 Scherzinger leaves behind the other pretty kitties in her Pussycat Dolls burlesque/pop/reality TV troupe with this long-in-the-works solo disc . There 's no shortage of production wattage : Timbaland , Polow Da Don , and Ne-Yo . The latter originally wrote the track " Save Me From Myself " for Britney Spears . Duran Duran Red Carpet Massacre November 13 " The funky path is a good path for us to take , " says singer Simon Le Bon of DD 's toe-tapping CD . Justin Timberlake helped the band get on the good foot , co-writing the propulsive " Nite Runner " and first single " Falling Down . " Ja Rule The Mirror November 13 The Queens rapper spices up his latest tranche of thug-love jams with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growling along to a prominent snippet of the Beatles ' " Eleanor Rigby , " while " 300 " features macho dialogue from the flick of the same name . Little Big Town A Place to Land November 13 This Nashville coed quartet scanned over a million of their last album , without ever rising above No. 51 on the Billboard 200 chart . But they 're country more in name than in twang . If rock fans starved for melody hear new songs like " Fine Line , " LBT could cross over in a big way . Seal System November 13 For his fifth CD , Seal draws on the thumping drums of his house-music roots and the expertise of Madonna producer Stuart Price . With its blasting synths , the title track should heat up dance floors , while " Wedding Day "  --  written on the morning of his marriage to Heidi Klum  --  is a sweet cooldown . Wu-Tang Clan The 8 Diagrams November 13 Is Wu-Tang really forever ? The hip-hop crew leaves no room for doubt on The 8 Diagrams , its first album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bastard . " Thug World " and ODB tribute " Life Changes " are vintage RZA beats , while " My People Gently Weep " is a surreal Beatles reimagining ( complete with help from George Harrison 's son , Dhani ) . Daft Punk Daft Punk Alive 2007 November 20 This year 's rare tour dates by French electro duo and alleged robots Daft Punk have already become the stuff of dance-music legend . Now you can hear why : Recorded in Paris , this captures the duo at its booming , ecstatic best . December Wyclef Jean The Carnival Volume II ( Memoirs of an Immigrant ) December 4 On his solo debut , 1997 's The Carnival , Wyclef promised he 'd be " Gone " Til November . " Can it be any coincidence this loose sequel is dropping in that selfsame calendar month ? Guest shots from T.I. , Paul Simon , and Shakira are among the diverse highlights of Jean 's latest world-pop potpourri . Mariah Carey As Yet Untitled December The success of Carey 's comeback CD , 2005 's The Emancipation of Mimi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did to the singer 's mighty pipes . So it 's no wonder Carey reteamed with the knob twiddler for her beat-driven follow-up , also featuring tracks by Stargate ( Rihanna 's " Unfaithful " ) and will.i.am .

Lo 's " Do It Well " ) , J.R . Rotem ( Rihanna 's " S.O.S. " ) SOUNDS LIKE Lots of upbeat pop tracks , such as first single " Tattoo " and " One Step at a Time , " which Sparks describes as " really happy-go-lucky , roll down your windows . It 's a feel-good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixtape that someone made you in the ' ' 80s . " Helping him achieve the Reagan-era vibe : his trademark beatboxing and a cameo by Doug E. Fresh . STANDOUT TRACKS " I 've got a song called " Overcome , ' ' " Sparks says . " It 's got a driving beat and it 's really different . I 've never sung a song like that . " An as-yet-untitled collaboration with Idol cohort Chris Richardson . " We wrote it in 45 minutes . I got a beat from J.R . It was a little piano , three-chords , and this cool , simple beat . " DREAM COLLABORATORS " Christina Aguilera . I would love to work with her , except she would probably blow me out of the park . " " Definitely Maroon 5 's Adam Levine . And Robin Thicke . I 'm inspired by his albums  --  the first album especially . " BOX Alicia Keys " As I Am , " November 13 All-New Alicia Keys , 26 , readies us for her reinvention New Sound On her new CD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different "  --  raspy , urgent . ( Hear for yourself on the addictive single " No One . " ) " All my albums are personal , but there 's so much more that I feel , and so much more I needed to say . " New Look Out : hats , braids .

" New Attitude " I used to be a wall-building , feeling-hiding con artist . I 'm at a whole other place now . I 'm gon na tell it how it is and how I feel it . I 'm not gon na sacrifice my spirit for nobody . " BOX " Graduation , " out now Kanye 's Work of ( CD ) Art Already the year 's fastest-selling CD in its first week , Kanye West 's " Graduation " is also among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vuitton 's Takashi Murakami ( above left ) . Via e-mail and a translator , the Japanese artist talks about his bond with rap 's self-proclaimed " Louis Vuitton don . " EW : Describe the visual concept of Graduation 's cover . Takashi Murakami : The cover is based on Kanye 's theme of student life . School 1 : It 's a place of dreams , of righteousness , a place to have fun 2 . It 's also occasionally a place where you experience the rigid dogma of the human race . Kanye 's music scrapes sentimentality and aggressiveness together like sandpaper , and he uses his grooves to unleash this tornado 3 that spins with the zeitgeist of the times . I too wanted to be swept up and spun around in that tornado . EW : How did you and West become acquainted ? TM : I was familiar with Kanye 's name as an important figure in the hip-hop world . All my staff members had his CDs . Kanye and I met face-to-face when he came to Japan in 2006 to tour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We got along well and talked about doing jewelry designs , which eventually blossomed into this Graduation collaboration and other things , including the invite for his birthday at NYC 's flagship Louis Vuitton store on June 7 . EW : What was it like working with another creative force ? TM : It could get pretty tough , as he approached me with different ideas every day . However , it was a productive clash of ideas between two artists with strong wills and visions . Regardless of the fact that Kanye and I have not known each other for a long time , we 've become very close . BOX " Rock N Roll Jesus , " October 9 Rock 's Songs " I was gon na call the record " Kid Rock Featuring Kid Rock " as a thumb in the air to all the hip-hop guys , " Rock reveals . " It 's like , can anybody make a record without a guest on every f  --  in ' song ? " The artist born Robert Ritchie , 36 , continues , " I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gon na sell more than you . " Ooh , that 'll take you far in life . I 'll go on record saying I 'm gon na sell more than both of them put together at the end of the day . But everyone goes , " Whoa , rappers fighting ! " Or " Look at that crazy black kid rapping with the funny golf pants on ! ' And then the rock bands all look like college kids . I 'm bored with all that s  --  . No one delivers a f  --  in ' album . " He thinks he has . Here are three highlights . " Amen " It 's Rock 's gospel/protest anthem , complete with choir . " When I say " Goddamn it , I 'm scared to send my children to church , ' that 's so relevant . All you hear about is priests molesting kids and all this right-wing Bible-thumping s  --  . I do believe in Jesus , but I 'm scared to send my kid to your organized-religious crazy bulls  --  . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left-wing hippie that wants to legalize drugs , but not anybody right down the middle . And to put it in a way that touches people 's souls , and takes " em to church with rock &; roll , it 's powerful . " " All Summer Long " " A friend asked me to listen to this beat , and I 'm like , " No , I 'm not doing a rap record . ' But he had " Werewolves of London " over it , and I go , " God , it 's the same chord progression as " Sweet Home Alabama . " " I 'd been listening to all these mash-ups , so I said , let 's do our own : take " Werewolves of London , " put it with " Sweet Home Alabama , " and write an original melody and lyric over it . " " Half Your Age " With its chorus " She 's half your age and twice as hot , " this rude honky-tonky ballad seems to be praising Rock 's girlfriend , May Andersen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never said the song was about her . For the record . You can thank every f  --  head attorney in the country for that . I even hate my own attorneys ! I do n't like getting specific with whom the lyrics are about , but I would like to get specific that all the attorneys in the country can engage Kid Rock in a sex act .

Neither is the Cure 's Robert Smith : " That was an in-my-wildest-dreams rumor . " However , here are some of the surprising names who are . " I never made a record before where I stayed up until 4 a.m. ! " Simpson says of working with producers Timbaland and the Neptunes ' Chad Hugo . " I was running back and forth between Chad in one studio and Tim 's camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pop star also enlisted Travis McCoy , who raps on the track " Murder . " More help came courtesy of acclaimed Ethiopian songwriter Kenna . " I went to people who were more about discovering my life at a new time , " Simpson says . " I just felt like having fun , shaking my booty and having a party vibe in the studio . " Which pretty much sums up the album 's synth-heavy sound , a combination of Studio 54-era disco and early-MTV pop influenced by female-fronted bands from before she was born : Blondie , the Pretenders , and Missing Persons . " I saw YouTube clips of Missing Persons singer Dale Bozzio 's performances and found her really inspiring . I love women who make a stand .
