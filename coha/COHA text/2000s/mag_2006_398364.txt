Section : CAPITOL IDEAS <p> THE ERA OF STEM CELLS , an advocacy campaign from the start , began eight years ago . On November 6 , 1998 , articles reporting the isolation of embryonic cells appeared in Science , and , not coincidentally , on the front page of the New York Times . The lengthy Times article was written by Nicholas Wade , a tireless champion of stem cells and their medical promise . More articles by him appeared in the next few days , some reporting that stem cells are immortal . For a while it seemed possible that defective tissue might eventually be replaced by immortal tissue , so that death itself might become a thing of the past . <p> In his article " Immortality , of a Sort , Beckons to Biologists , " prominently featured in the paper 's " Science " section that November 17 , Wade wrote that if stem cells could be " guided down " the right paths , they could then be " immortalized " by the addition of a particular gene . The tissues they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Hazeltine of Human Genome Sciences foresaw old and worn out tissue being replaced with immortalized stem cells  --  " a clearly articulated vision of human immortality that will be introduced slowly over the next 50 years . " <p> Even at the time , such claims seemed one step removed from the fraudulent . Since then the claim that the activation of a gene can release a substance  --  telomerase  --  that can immortalize a cell has been abandoned . The only immortal cells we know of are cancer cells . Claims of immortality are no longer heard , but the stock price of Geron Corporation , the company that had funded early stem-cell research , soon soared , peaking above $69 a share in 2000 . ( It has since fallen to a tenth of that value . ) Geron was founded by Michael D. West  --  a " visionary , " in Nicholas Wade 's estimation  --  whose initial purpose in founding the company was to research aging and if possible do something about it . <p> The early reporting on stem cells emphasized the immortality claim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , Science magazine wrote that James Thomson and his team at the University of Wisconsin " report in this issue of Science that they have isolated stem cells from human embryos and coaxed them to grow in five ' immortal ' cell lines " That was an important reason why stem cells attracted so much attention . It was n't just diabetics and Parkinson 's patients who stood to benefit , but everyone who wanted to stay young . <p> Just about every news story ever written on stem cells has been divided into two parts . On the one hand , the bright medical promise shines before us . Stem cells have the " potential " to turn into almost any of the more specialized cells . This in turn will provide tissue engineers with an endless supply of spare parts . Whether immortal or not , they will be able to replace defective cells . But then comes the dark side . Scientists will have to contend with the moralists and naysayers who care not a whit for progress and the quality of life . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial with a headline that set the trend : " A Ban on Cells That Could Heal . " <p> In 1995 , Congress had banned the federal financing of research on cells derived from embryos . That ban was later lifted , but in August 2001 President Bush decreed that the use of federal funds for such research would be restricted to those stem-cell lines already in existence . Briefly applauded for allowing the research to continue , Bush soon became the villain . How could science possibly progress without federal money ? The conflict between hopeful science and reactionary morality has remained the storyline of choice ever since . <p> California voters bought the argument that taxpayers ' money can prevail over all scientific challenges . In 2004 , they approved a $3 billion ballot initiative , permitting stem-cell scientists in the state to circumvent federal restrictions . Governor Schwarzenegger collaborated , as he has more recently with a politically correct anti-global warming measure that threatens to cost the state a lot more than $3 billion . <p> THE WELL-ADVERTISED CONFLICT between progressive science and backward ethics has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes the actual deceptiveness of the scientific claims made on behalf of embryonic stem cells . <p> The principal claim is that they can have the potential to develop into any cell in the body . Here is how John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins put it in the first sentence of his article in the November 6 , 1998 issue of Science : " Pluripotential stem cells , present in the early stages of embryo development , can generate all of the cell types in a fetus and in the adult and are capable of self-renewal . " <p> The key word here is " can . " He does not say " have been shown to . " From the beginning , the claim made on behalf of embryonic stem cells simply expands upon the definition of stem cells . Gearhart 's sentence above could be rewritten : " Stem cells that can generate all of the cell types in a fetus can generate all of the cell types in a fetus .. " <p> We know that a fertilized egg has the potential to develop into all the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the womb , it will in fact develop into a full body with all its cell types . That is all that is being claimed . It is deceptive because a definitional truth masquerades as an empirical claim . It looks as though something has been demonstrated in the lab , when it is simply inherent in a definition . <p> Scott King , who runs a small biotech company in San Francisco , keeps a close eye on stem cells because he is himself a type 1 ( juvenile ) diabetic and therefore has a personal stake in the outcome of this research . He is one of the very few people to have pointed out the tautological nature of the major claim made on behalf of stem cells . They are simply cells that have the potential to differentiate into other types of cells , he says . Go back to an early enough stage of the embryo , and it is both true and uncontroversial to say that the cells of that embryo are " pluripotent . " They certainly can turn into most other cell types , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally . <p> The definitional problem with stem cells , and the circularity of the claims made on their behalf , has received almost no attention in the literature . Wade did point out in his 1998 Times article that the stem cells obtained from embryos " do not seem definably different from the handful of primordial cells from which an entire individual is created . " And in 2004 , two stem-cell experts wrote in the Scientific American that stem cells " can not be distinguished by appearance . They are defined by their behavior . " But the general public is unaware of the problem . <p> The second , and crucial , stem-cell claim is that , having extracted these cells from the early-stage embryo , scientists can then coax , nudge , or direct them into becoming whatever specialized cells are desired : in the case of diabetics , insulin-making islet cells , for example . But this has turned out to be extraordinarily difficult to achieve . Eight years of tinkering and coaxing have not yet resulted in the generation of any human islet cells from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a stem-cell researcher at the National Institutes of Health , who rashly said a few years ago that stem cells could be made to " jump through hoops , " did claim to have generated insulin-producing cells from embryonic mouse cells . That became a page-one story for the New York Times in 2001 . It " seems to be the first time that a miniature organ has been coaxed to form from embryonic stem cells , " Nicholas Wade wrote . But within a year Douglas Melton of Harvard had shown that the claim was wrong . In doing their experiments , McKay and others had used insulin as a growth factor , and concluded that the insulin they detected had come from newly generated islet cells . In fact it had been there all along . <p> There followed in 2005 the fraudulent claims of the South Korean researcher Wu Suk Hwang , who claimed that he had created stem cells from cloned embryos . In this technique , a prospective patient 's cell is put into an egg from which the nucleus has been removed . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines in one out of every 12 tries . The advantage of this method is that the resulting cells would match the DNA of the patient , and this ( perhaps ) would mean that the resulting differentiated cells , if they were ever obtained , would not be recognized and rejected by the patient 's immune system . But the results were all faked anyway . That the head of an expensively equipped , government-supported lab would resort to such desperate measures shows how difficult genetic engineering has turned out to be . <p> IN SHORT , YES , STEM CELLS DO HAVE the potential to turn into more specialized cells ( that is what we mean by a stem cell ) . But after eight years of trial and error , scientists have not yet shown that they know how to nudge or coax or direct any given cell in a desired direction  --  for example , into the dopamine producing cells that are needed to combat Parkinson 's disease . <p> In extenuation it is said that not only has U.S. research been restricted , but that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But around the world , thousands of scientists are working full time on this problem . Stem-cell research with full government cooperation is underway in at least seven countries : Britain , Israel , Singapore , and China among them . In the U.S. , privately funded research has expanded rapidly . Harvard University has embarked on such a project , as have other institutions , for whom the U.S. restrictions have created a fund-raising opportunity . <p> Before too long the general public will begin to suspect that something is amiss , and here is what I believe it is . <p> How do the cells of the normally growing fetus " know " how to develop into the specialized cells of a functioning body ? For decades this has been the great unanswered question of embryology . It remains unanswered to this day . Stem-cell scientists would have done us all a favor by admitting this eight years ago . But modern scientists hate to admit to ignorance in their own field because it seems so unprofessional . <p> One answer , however , is that cells " know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by coming into contact with adjacent cells . In fact , the body should be thought of as a society of cells that " learn " from one another . It is like a highly successful school , in which billions of pupils learn from each other how to specialize into hundreds of different trades . The stem-cell scientist is the optimist who believes he can isolate a single infant from this school and , by private tutoring and coaxing , propel it along a particular path of specialization . This , it seems to me , is the great error underlying the therapeutic theory of stem cells . Scientists do n't know how the body 's " school " works , and yet they imagine they can replicate its results in the isolation of the lab . To date , the only realistic method at their disposal has been trial and error . <p> Notice that this precisely reverses the great " engineering " error of the 20th century . " Social engineers " believed that nature was malleable and that education could reshape it . Human nature turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great socialist experiment failed for that reason . Today 's genetic engineers believe the opposite . Nature  --  the genome  --  is everything and each cell is centrally directed by some genetic program that we do n't understand yet . In the simplified model that biologists have worked with , most things worth knowing about the cell are located in the nucleus  --  in the DNA , Francis Crick did us no favor in claiming that in explaining DNA , he was explaining life . That was hubris , pure and simple . Life is far more complicated than DNA . <p> The idea that the cells of the growing body " learn " by coming into contact with one another is something that scientists would prefer not to think about . It means that understanding the cell will turn out to be a hundred times more difficult than it already is . Another consequence is that the stem-cell dream might have to be postponed indefinitely . A recent New York Times article , headlined " Some Scientists See Shift in Stem Cell Hopes , " hinted at this . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the research , " but envisage " a longer-term program , " Nicholas Wade wrote . He added that " work since 2001 has produced no significant advance .
