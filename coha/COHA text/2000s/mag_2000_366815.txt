Economists ponder the wealth effect the way many of us ponder alien life . They 're pretty sure it 's out there  --  but they ca n't prove it , they do n't know how big it is , and they have n't a clue if it 's dangerous . All of which is creating a bit of a stir among the dismal-science lot as their famous and thought-to-be-flawless colleague , Alan Greenspan , relentlessly jacks up interest rates to wage an undeclared war on this vague creature . <P> The wealth effect , simply , is the penchant to spend more as net worth climbs . You probably do n't lie awake at night fretting about the problems that increasing your wealth may bring , but it 's an issue in Washington because spending is the root of inflation . And inflation is bad . One way to attack it , therefore , is to attack net worth . <P> These days that means going after the stock market , and there can be little doubt that that 's what Chairman Greenspan is up to  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Last week the Fed boss pushed the benchmark federal funds target rate to 6% , the fifth increase in nine months . For emphasis , he raised the symbolic discount rate as well and all but promised more to come . Banks followed by boosting their prime rate to 9% , the highest in five years  --  meaning higher costs for credit cards and mortgages . <P> Never mind that the markets shrugged , then rallied . The Dow closed the week up 4.9% ; the supercharged NASDAQ rose 3.4% . That may only strengthen Greenspan 's resolve . To be sure , the economy has been dangerously robust the past couple of quarters . And the gross domestic product is expected to rise 4.1% this year , well ahead of the Fed 's presumed " speed limit " of around 3.5% . The torrid growth rate is what Greenspan cites most often when justifying rate increases . <P> But GDP expansion is a bit of a paper tiger . The economy grew 4.1% last year and even faster in 1998 , yet aside from oil prices there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the angst about overheating , there are signs of a slowdown , most noticeably in the crucial housing sector . The dollar is in fine shape . And while rising oil prices have skewed the Consumer Price Index to a three-year high , the core rate is up a very modest 2.1% for the past 12 months . <P> So , why continue to raise rates ? The Fed plainly is paramountly concerned that rising stock prices are creating such a glow around the nation 's dinner tables that a family spending barrage is about to render household goods scarce and send consumer prices spiraling through the roof . It 's an interesting theory . It 's also a leap that could shut down the expansion prematurely and tarnish Greenspan 's sterling reputation  --  potentially derailing Al Gore 's presidential train , much as a weak economy did George Bush 's in 1992 . <P> Certainly , the bull market has added greatly to Americans ' wealth and stimulated extra spending . Greenspan cites long-term studies showing that of every $1 made in the market , 3cents to 4cents gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the real economy . Multiplied over trillions of dollars of new market wealth , that translates into billions of dollars in additional consumer spending and a 1%-to-2% boost in the nation 's output .
