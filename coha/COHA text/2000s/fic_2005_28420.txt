Candy Licker By Noire Random House Noire Money , Lust , Fame It was a little after one on a Friday night and mics were on fire at the House of Homicide . Junius " Hurricane " Jackson was Homicide 's CEO , producer , and all-around king niggah in charge . Hurricane commanded mad respect on the streets of New York City , and even the most thugged-out criminals feared him like the badass hustler that he was . The House of Homicide was located smack in the middle of Harlem , on a block that stayed live twenty-four hours a day . It was originally built as a neighborhood movie theater , but when Hurricane started running things , he converted it into a hot nightclub/recording studio that attracted hundreds of ballers , rappers , and hopeful wannabe artists looking to get on a stage and get paid . Every superhead in Harlem wanted to be down on Homicide 's tip . The crack fiends , the teenage baby mamas . The video hoes who were lost and turned out . " That Cane niggah is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-naked outside the studio , posing and shivering in the cold , just dying to get a spot on his latest video shoot . " Let that rich motherfucka put the camera on me . I 'll rock my ass so hard he 'll forget his mama 's name ! " Yeah , Hurricane was a living legend in Harlem , and he had his House on lock and under total control . He was a genius when it came to recognizing raw street talent , and he dominated the music industry so viciously it made those cats over at Crunk Cuts and Ruthless Rap look weak and broke-down . Hurricane was in deep with the Mafia too , and they gave him a lot of rope . He strong-armed a bunch of small businesses and laundered Mob money through almost all of them , especially the corner liquor store he owned and his rib joint that was right next door . He played the role of a community leader and all that too . You know , giving out free turkeys during the holidays and sponsoring bookmobiles and things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat knots in his pockets and was even known to organize street cleanups and pay people 's bills when they got too far behind . But nothing went down in Harlem that Hurricane was n't involved in . No deals got made , no pussy got sold , no dice got tossed . Nobody so much as rolled a blunt unless Hurricane got his cut . Hurricane had mad pull from coast to coast . In the time that I 'd known him he 'd signed some of the hottest singers and rap artists from L.A. to Miami and snatched them into his camp . A few artists he straight stole from other labels , and some he actually got honest . But no matter how they got here , the minute they put their name on the dotted line their asses belonged to the House of Homicide , and Hurricane Jackson became their don , their daddy , and their dictator . This Friday night was starting out just like any other . I was chilling downstairs in one of the recording rooms with two hopeful artists , Jazzy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homicide . The House was packed , and rappers and video hoes were lined up out the door and around the corner waiting for their chance to jump in the pit and impress Hurricane . Jazzy had been here once before , but it was Danita 's first night in the House . Since we were sitting around waiting for the pit to go live , we decided to kill some time listening to some bootleg mix tapes somebody had brought in off the streets . I 'd watched both of these chicks rehearse the tracks they were gon na perform in the pit tonight , and they did n't sound half bad . The problem was they were regular . Did n't nothing stand out about them except they asses . I knew exactly which rooms they would end up in , and it damn sure was n't gon na be no mic room like they were hoping . Jazzy was the cutest of the two and she was rocking a pair of Donna Karan shorts that were so tight the V between her legs looked like a camel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fly little Rocawear miniskirt that clung to her thighs and rode up her hips every time she moved . Upstairs , the music was banging and the party was in full charge . The way Danita and Jazzy were flossing I could tell they were ready to rush up the steps , grab a baller , and get crunk in the middle of the mix . " Damn , Candy , " Danita said , winding her hips and slurping from a cold bottle of beer . " I ai n't into no bitches , but you one lucky heffah ! Booming body , pretty red hair , blue eyes , light chocolate skin . . . I see why that niggah Hurricane got you laced up so lovely . Do you , boo ! If I was laying up with Hurricane I 'd be iced out and cutting hits left and right too . But just wait till your niggah hears some of my rhymes . I'ma press his ass out ! " I just nodded and thought about Dominica and Vonzelle , my girls from Scandalous ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time too , so I understood what kinda cloud their heads were stuck in . Born singing , I 'd had visions of being a superstar for as long as I could remember . But hard knocks and cold men had taught me a little somethin ' about the music business that Jazzy and Danita must did n't know . These chicks could n't see past the obvious . The bright lights , iced-out jewels , expensive cars . . . all this shit came with a price on it , a price that sexing Hurricane had taught me I could n't afford to pay . ooo I 'd met some pretty mean niggahs during my travels , but Hurricane Jackson was the first one to show me what real pain was all about . Hurricane held a lease on my life . He 'd paid the Mob cash money for my ass , and his word and his protection were the only things keeping me alive . I got my first taste of Hurricane 's cruelty while I was laid up naked in his bed , and the minute I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fried . The niggah was a bonecrusher . He had a body like Mr. Universe . Mike Tyson did n't have shit on him . Swole chest , twelve-pack stomach . Muscles everywhere . But it was mainly for show . Sex with Hurricane was all about Hurricane , and he got his pleasure by seeing other people in pain . No tonguing me down or licking my neck . That was the last thing on his mind . He did n't even stroke the poon-poon or worry whether or not it was wet . Nope , fucking Hurricane was unlike anything I 'd ever known , and I would find out the hard way that his foreplay was even more destructive than his name . Do n't get me wrong . Ai n't nobody out here perfect , but there are some brothers who been blessed with gifts that can make a sistah climb the walls . Hurricane , too , had been blessed in a lot of ways . He was powerful , he was rich , he was fine , and everybody knew he had crazy musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Hurricane was lacking , and a deficiency like the one he had , especially in a such a big , strong , buff-ass man , was enough to turn even the most mellow niggah into a raging maniac . Yeah , Hurricane Jackson had a whole lot of things the average brothah could only dream of , but what he was missing was the one thing all his money and his power could n't buy him . A dick . ooo The first time Hurricane took me home to the banging mansion he kept on Long Island , nothing in my life had ever impressed me more . About a thousand niggahs lived up in there with him , but I did n't care . He was rich . His place was a palace compared to the holes I 'd lived in . The windows were paneless and made of flat dark glass , the ceilings were twenty feet high , and the floors were smoked Italian marble bordered with gold trim . Everything about his crib screamed quality and cash , and as much grief and drama as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay back and enjoy a few luxuries in my life . Hurricane took me inside and made sure I met the other wifeys who stayed there , and then later on that night he let me bathe in his $30,000 onyx tub . I damn near melted when I saw his huge custom-built , oversize Hypnos bed . It was sitting up on a raised platform that was down in a sunken area in the middle of the room . The top of the bed had a canopy of black and white silk curtains that were tied back with tiny silver chains . Six carpeted steps led down into the sleeping area , and six more made of smoked black glass led back up to the bed on all four sides . I felt like a queen as he kissed my neck , then held my hand and escorted me all the way up to the top . " Sweet Candy , " Hurricane whispered as he pulled back the thick towel and stared at my naked body . " Soft brown skin and "  - -  he tangled his fingers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some jawns up in here , but you 's a keeper . " My nature was always running hot and I could n't wait to feel him inside of me . My nipples were aching to be kissed , and thick juices were percolating between my legs . I laid there like a fool , grinning and posing all up in those sheets , ready to go all out for the man who was gon na make me a big star . But I figured out what kind of party it was the minute he pulled down his pants and started grinding me so hard I swore the bed would break down . You ever heard of beating a pussy until you knocked it out ? Well that 's what Hurricane did to mine . He raised himself up on his hands and knees , slammed his hips down hard enough to crack my pubic bone , then grinded like he was on a mission to kill somebody . " Slow down , baby , " I begged , trying to catch up with his warp-speed rhythm . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know shit about shit neither . Yeah , I 'd played a little touchy-feely a couple of times , and true , I was a professional masturbator , but nothing I 'd experienced had been anything like the express train that was roaring on top of me right now . I wanted to get with him , but all that pounding was drying up my juices , so I grabbed his thick arms , squeezing his muscles , then slid my hands down his back and held tight to his trim waist . " Wait , " I whispered , spreading my legs wider as I tried my best to feel him . " Is it in yet , baby ? Is it in ? " He froze . " What you say ? " Working my hips to get in his groove , I rounded under him and rubbed his ass , letting my hands work the thick muscles of his back . " Put it in now , " I demanded , arching my back and brushing my nipples against his hard chest , eager to get my pussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go ' head and slide all a ' that good dick up inside me baby ! " Hurricane moved fast . He slid his palms under my hips and grabbed one ass cheek in each hand . Then he squeezed my mounds like they were two lemons , balling his hands into tight fists and digging his fingers so deep into my booty muscles he almost paralyzed me . I screamed . " I said , what the fuck did you say ? " Sweat broke out all over me and I arched my back and clenched my ass tight , panting against the pain . " Candy ! " he growled in my ear . " What the fuck did you just say ? " I honest-to-God did n't know what the hell I 'd said . Whatever it was , I damn sure was n't about to say it again . He rolled off of me and reached across the huge bed , searching for something under his pillow . " I'ma put something in your ass , " he said in a low voice . " Put something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I almost screamed again when I saw what he had in his hand . That crazy motherfucker was holding a gun . And not one of those regular old Saturday night specials either . I 'd seen this kind of gun before , it was Seagram 's favorite piece . A .44 caliber Magnum with a hair trigger . The kind of shit you roll with when you wan na blow a niggah 's brains out through the back of his head . Hurricane cursed and slapped the barrel across my mouth , busting open my bottom lip . I swallowed blood and panicked when I saw the crazy look in his eyes . My teeth were clenched but he forced me to open them shits , shoving that barrel halfway down my throat , then taking it out and cracking it first against my collarbone and then dead on the tip of my elbow . I yelped and rolled over , balling up in a knot and cradling the black pain that ran from my shoulder all the way down to my fingertips . Suddenly he was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being pushed between my legs . All I could think was that the gun had a hair trigger and was gon na go off and blow me up from the inside out . I screamed and fought , but come on people . You know who had the wins . And then my pussy was being filled up for real . With something so hard and icy it got my whole body to shivering with pain . But as chilly and cold as that revolver was , just take my word for it and believe me when I tell you . It was n't half as cold as Hurricane 's heart . ooo Jazzy and Danita both did the damn thang in the pit and came out sweating me with a thousand questions , screaming , ' cause Jay-Z and Kanye were both in the house , and feenin ' like industry freaks to find out what Hurricane thought about their performance . I tried to tell them to play it chill , that Hurricane knew hot talent when he saw it , and if he thought the opportunity to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way in hell he was gon na let it slide . I know I made Hurricane sound like a nine-headed monster , but actually , he was n't much different than a lot of other entertainment hustlers out there like Suge Knight , Irv Gotti , and even P.Diddy with his crazy self . Cane kept a posse of street-hard soldiers around him ten to twenty deep , and most of them were either bangers or stone criminals who did n't have no artistic talent but were down for whatever . They would take a niggah out real quick and then show you where the bodies were buried . From what I 'd heard , Hurricane had pulled a little bid upstate for killing a drug dealer . It was up there that he made all the connections that helped him launch his record label and finance the hooked-up studio that we were chilling in right now . The real deal was that Hurricane had done something a whole lot of other hustlers wished they could do . He 'd gotten in good with the right people and started sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
