1 . Stop being afraid . Connie Nixon 's house starts talking to her at 9:51 p.m. on a Wednesday . She has just finished pawing through her heart and examining the long lines of desire that parade through her body like an endless roll of string and tangle in a knot inside her chest . Her left hand is holding the knot , loosened briefly by means of the pen in her right hand that has translated her dreams into the list . The 48th list . Connie Franklin Nixon 's list of dreams . Connie 's list-making tonight has been assisted by one and then two glasses of red wine-a really nice dry cabernet from Australia-and she is trying to decide if she should have another glass . This would push her way over the halfway mark , as far as her usual alcohol consumption goes , and into a semi-critical " what the hell " state that she associates with the early stages of drunken folly , Saturday nights on her sister 's back porch and the good old days , which did not last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connie Nixon rolls over , lets the pages of her list fold against each other , drops the pen , grabs the gorgeous dark red bottle off her book-laden nightstand and pours the wine into the rounded , clear glass so close to the top that she has to lean over and sip it before she can actually pick up the glass . That exact moment is when she hears the housespeaking . " What ? " she whispers out loud . As if she is answering the walls that seem to be speaking . " What did you say ? " She pauses . Her top lip is swimming in wine and her bottom lip has wedged itself against the smooth glass , her breath in a holding pattern . Six years alone in this house have left her on more-than-intimate terms with every squeak , roof sway , late-night foundation settling creak , gutter birds , falling limbs , and an assortment of other sounds that are as familiar to Connie as a rushing waterfall might be to someone on an enchanted vacation . Even before those six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , climbing in through unlocked windows after curfew and sliding their tricycles , bicycles , cars and motorcycles into the garage door from dawn to dusk , there was a rhythm to the sounds , a symphony of life , a ballet of movement that signaled a house settling in around its family , the arms of the walls wrapping them close and keeping the rain and snow off the beds and dressers and the kitchen table . The sound Connie hears now , however , is a distant voice , a faint indistinguishable rumble that tangos itself into a kind of hum . It is highlighted by a hint of music , as if someone has left a radio playing at the far edge of the basement . It echoes and sways as if it is about to snuff itself out and , when Connie pauses , unmoving , not frightened but a bit confused about its origin , the sound does not change or grow or stop or turn into something else . " Maybe , " she speculates . " Maybe the list has started to speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings her legs off the edge of the bed . Accustomed to sleeping in whatever she happens to be wearing at the moment she falls into bed , Connie makes certain that if she has to avert disaster she can do so with at least partial dignity . When she looks down , she sees that she has on an old navy-colored t-shirt that will at the very least come to her knees when she stands up and , peeking out from the left side , where she has her foot raised , a pair of cotton underwear , original color unknown , present color something just this side of an old gray sock , frayed like hell along the edge of the stretched elastic . Peril , disaster , trauma , the unknown-none of those things totally frighten Connie Nixon . She adores silence , most unexpected events , the way the simple shift of the wind can change everything . Death rolls into her hands on a daily basis at her hospital-she says " her " as if she owns the place and indeed she has worked there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and day , tirelessly , with passion and compassion . Her real fears , the ones she has acknowledged , have been translated into the list she now holds in her hand . " Ha , " she thinks , standing quietly at the side of her bed and totally focused on the sound she hears . " What could this be ? " She pauses there , unafraid , hands on hips , listening . The whisper of sound returns . Connie smiles to herself because she thinks the walls may be singing . When she lifts her head , she can see her reflection in the mirror that has hung above the old black dresser for 28 years . " I 'm not dead and just imagining this , " she tells herself out loud . Mystified by the now-constant humming , Connie listens hard . She decides to check every corner of the house . First she leans across her nightstand , missing the lamp and maneuvering past the books , places her hands against the wall , and then turns her head to press her ear flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over stacks of books , a pile of magazines , three empty water glasses and last week 's wine bottle , Connie manages to get to the door of her own bedroom without falling over a box or impaling herself on a coat hanger , one of her ex-husband 's leftover baseball trophies , or what she has decided to call " the endless stacks of shit . " " It 's a lifetime of shit , " her best friend Frannie O'Brien has told her 16 times since Connie started making huge donations to the local Goodwill store six months ago . " This purging is n't going to happen overnight . Get used to it . " Connie counts on Frannie , or O'Brien , as she prefers to be called , to say it like it is no matter where they are , who is in the room , or whose feelings might get hurt . A psychiatric nurse who refuses to quit smoking even as she passes Connie 's intensive care unit and its coughing patients numerous times each week , O'Brien has worked with Nurse Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , swears like a Hells Angel or a high school junior , and plays poker with her nephews , the neighbor boys and six guys at the senior center three times a month . " Remember , " O'Brien is always quick to add , " even if it 's a lifetime of shit , it 's still shit and you need to get rid of it . " This from a six-foot-tall Afro-American woman who married a short Irishman named Daniel , throwing the entire redheaded Catholic Irish family and the entire blackheaded Catholic Afro-American family into parallel cultural comas ; who attends church herself more religiously than her rosary-saying mother-in-law ; who produced two strapping Afro-Irish sons , and who has definitely not thrown away so much as a toothpick or plastic bag in the last 15 years . " Shit , " O'Brien is quick to say in her own defense , " is shit only if you do n't think you will ever use it again . " The baseball trophies are obviously shit , Connie decides , as she pushes one over with her toe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now trendy 1960s ranch house . " Go figure , " her real estate broker told her when she dropped off the papers five weeks ago . " Young couples love these houses . They turn them into art deco retro masterpieces and they want to live just like you did-you know , the June Cleaver kind of deal-when you first moved in here . They add a bathroom in the basement , get a Weber grill , and have another baby . " " June Cleaver , my ass , " is what Connie wanted to say . " June Cleaver did n't put herself through nursing school by working full-time and trying constantly not to get pregnant . She did n't suffer through the night shift for five years so someone would always be there with the kids , probably never mowed a lawn or shoveled the driveway in her life , and never realized until the mid- ' 70s that the Beaver was destined to be gay . My God , the kid wore patent leather shoes , parted his hair on the side and carried his books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on ' Queer Eye for the Straight Guy . ' " The house murmured her out of the 1960s and into the short hall-nothing unusual there-past the two smaller bedrooms where more boxes of shit sat waiting for transportation to their new destinations , into the living room that was still untouched so Connie could make believe one part of her life was still intact . Connie went through the dining room , which she 'd enlarged herself one rare afternoon off when , sick of the tiny kitchen , she had walked into the garage to find a sledgehammer , knocked a hole through the plaster and announced to her then-husband Roger , " Now will you knock out the wall like I 've asked you to for the past three years ? " Connie laughed whenever she stood in the spot where the wall used to divide the kitchen and the dining room . Sometimes she stood in that spot eight times a day and she laughed every single time . Sometimes , when she just needed to laugh , she stood there , too , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall-bashing incident that Connie realized she could have set up a couple of strengthening beams and knocked out the wall without asking for help from a single person , especially her husband . It was less than a year later , when she ripped out the old carpeting one Saturday night while Roger was fishing , as she was kneeling on the bare floor with carpet nails jammed between her lips and pounding in the new padding , that she counted up the hours she spent with her husband and without him . Something that felt like the size and weight of a bowling ball moved through her heart and lodged in her stomach . " Sex , " she told herself , spitting out the nails into her hand , " is the one thing left I thought I needed a husband for these past few years , but I can probably figure out how to do that myself too . He 's never even here , for crying out loud . " The rest of that afternoon , pounding , ripping , and working as a mother-referee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage and how it seemed as if she had suddenly passed through some kind of narrow tunnel that only had room for one person-just her .
