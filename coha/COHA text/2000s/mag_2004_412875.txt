Government agencies : To locate the Web site of a particular agency , just type the name into a search engine . But what if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , take a look at FirstGov.gov ( see FIGURE 4 ) , the granddaddy of government sites .

But big search engines do n't work efficiently for some personal needs , such as cooking advice .

The results list left me underwater and underwhelmed : There were too many recipes from amateur cooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe was better than another . Recipes : For the dish on gastronomic creations from Bon Appetit and Gourmet magazines , how to make a certain cocktail , or where to dine on an impending trip , Epicurious ( www.epicurious.com , see FIGURE 5 ) almost always scores .

Medical conditions and drugs : The Merck Manual ( fmd.pcworld.com/406S8 , see FIGURE 6 ) , a service of the pharmaceutical giant , is a concise and useful starting guide for all things medicinal . The Mayo Clinic 's site ( www.mayoclinic.com ) stockpiles current , expert information on diseases and drugs , interactive tools to help you make health decisions , and question-and-answer material from specialists .

You can compare products , prices , and store reviews in a flash , and then make your purchase . Enter your zip code if you would like the site to include shipping costs in its price comparison calculations . Shopping.com 's product finder tool allows you to browse by price or brand .

Click a particular product , and you 'll quickly see the number of reviews , an overall recommendation , and the product 's pros and cons , as listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trolling the Epinions.com site . In the past , however , PC World reviewers have noted a seemingly disproportionate number of positive product reviews at BizRate , so you may have to take the opinions you see there with the proverbial grain of salt . // FIGURE 8 : Get comparison shopping information-along with store ratings from past customers-at BizRate. // Nextag.com provides quick price comparisons similar to BizRate 's , but covers fewer stores . Price-Grabber , which you 'll find at www.pricegrabber.com and on partner sites such as our own PCWorld.com , supplies store ratings , but from fewer consumers and for fewer stores than BizRate . You can save yourself time when shopping for bargains by signing up to be notified via e-mail when the price drops below the threshold you specify ; Nextag.com provides a similar service , but Shopping.com and BizRate do not .

Sidebar WEB TRACKERS Keep Tabs on What Internet Sites Are Saying About You and Your Business WE ALL NEED TO KNOW what Web sites are saying about us . If you run a small business , you have to market yourself on the Web to potential customers and partners , but you also must protect your reputation online . And everyone who uses the Internet needs to keep close watch on personal privacy . " You have to find a balance , " says Bobby Morgenstern , a Boston-area real estate agent with Coldwell Banker . Like other agents , Morgenstern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule : Always guard your home phone number zealously . Starting with online reverse-lookup directories ( www.reversephonebook.com is one ) , a home phone number opens many windows into your private life . Do n't use your home phone number on business-related documents . Instead , take advantage of inexpensive mobile phone plans . " I give out my cell phone number almost exclusively , " Morgenstern says . just beware of plans that charge for each incoming call . Morgenstern maintains an AOL profile and several Web pages that advertise her business , but she watches the details closely to keep the information they contain generic . And while personal networking plays a big role in her work , she declines to answer non-work-related questions for surveys and group directories . " Many say they do n't share the information , but you do n't know , " she notes . Morgenstern also avoids online surveys and removes herself from online phone directories such as Google 's ( see find.pcworld.com/40703 for directions on removing your number ) . WATCH WHAT YOU FILE INFORMATION ON PAPER CAN GET ONLINE , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entity , says Jim Harvey , a partner at the Atlanta law firm of Alston &; Bird , where he advises clients on privacy and data management . " If a corporation does a transaction that involves a public authority , like buying property , they have to expect the details will be available publicly . And once it 's online , it 's out of the box , " he says . When people disparage your business in forums or elsewhere online , your options are limited by a formidable legal heavyweight in the First Amendment right to free speech , Harvey says . " If someone is untruthful or is engaging in a campaign that might break a law , things can be done . Otherwise , people are free to say what they want to say , " he says . Check out the public records on your company and/or yourself at Search Systems ( www.searchsystems.net ) to see what factual data your clients or partners might uncover . Should you also pay for a report on your company from a service such as KnowX ( www.knowx.com ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genie Tyburski , a law librarian at Pennsylvania-based Ballard Spahr Andrews &; Ingersoll . She manages The Virtual Chase ( www.virtualchase.com ) , a site packed with Internet research advice . KnowX does n't dig as deeply as a good professional researcher will , she says . " A good search absolutely reguires the use of multiple sources of information , " she says . For a thorough picture , Tyburski recommends that you hire a public records research expert to do an initial investigation covering public records , Web mentions , and information available by phone from professional or public agencies . Look to the Association of Independent Information Professionals ( www.aiip.org ) for referrals , and expect to spend $300 to $500 , she advises . To monitor Web information about your company , Tyburski recommends a service such as TrackEngine ( www.trackengine.com ) , which alerts you to mentions of keywords at specific sites-from newsgroups to competitors ' sites . It keeps tabs on up to 10 different sites for $20 a year , and $60 per year buys monitoring of 50 sites . // INFOMINE aggregates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hidden Web A UNIVERSE OF HIDDEN RESOURCES exists online , in what some people call the " deep " or " invisible " Internet . This includes the rich databases of information from businesses , universities , government agencies , and other organizations that the Web 's search engines ca n't spider and thus ca n't include in their results . How do you find the ones that are most useful to you ? A wise way to kick off your search : Look through a list of hidden resources , broken down into categories that you can browse for relevance to your work and interests . The Invisible Web Directory ( www.invisible-web.net ) lists hidden sites in topic groups ranging from art to business . ( Much of its material comes from The Invisible Web , a book by Chris Sherman and Gary Price . ) Sherman , who now edits the SearchEngineWatch.com newsletter SearchDay ( find.pcworld.com/40679 ) , recommends that you check out ResearchBuzz ( www.researchbuzz.org ) and the Librarians ' Index to the Internet ( lii.org ) for updated advice on hidden sources . Sidebar " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's very difficult for them to get past the search form and explore their contents , " Sherman says . He estimates that the hidden Web is 2 to 50 times larger than the visible Web . Direct Search ( find.pcworld.com/40682 ) , a site hosted by FreePint and run by Gary Price , gathers invisible Web databases into well-organized categories and allows you to simultaneously query both regular search engines and some facts databases . // FIND LINKS TO " HIDDEN " databases and many other Web resources at BrightPlanet 's CompletePlanet site .

Metasearch sites Dogpile ( www.dogpile.com ) and EzZFind ( www.ez2find.com ) query the popular search sites as well as some deep Web material , often yielding great results with a minimum of visual distraction . A different kind of metasearch engine is Vivisimo ( www.vivisimo.com ) , which clusters results for easy selection .
