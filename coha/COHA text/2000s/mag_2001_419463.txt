SCIENCE &; TECHNOLOGY Headnote " . . . Information from genomics promises to improve many aspects of our lives , not only through new drugs and improved crops , but by preserving wildlife and protecting the environment . " // THE STATE OF THE ART in life science-biology , medicine , and agriculture-resembles the situation geographers found themselves in centuries ago . Early cartographers had a small bit of information and tried , with obvious errors , to produce a view of what the world looked like . The maps of that era were equally off target , with misshapen or missing continents and dire warnings about the dangers and dragons that existed in the unknown waters . A teacher in the third century A.D. , Lactantius Firmianus , said , " Can there be a place on Earth where things are upside down , where the trees grow downwards , and the rain , hail , and snow fall upward ? The mad idea that the Earth is round is the cause of this imbecile legend . " Although early concepts of the world are comical today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite reasonable , given the information they had . Just as explorers such as Christopher Columbus , Ferdinand Magellan , and Hernando Cortes brought rapid change to the understanding of the Earth , a new field of biology promises to bring great and fast strides into the understanding of living organisms . The new area of study focuses on the genes of living organisms , first by mapping out the structure of all of the individual genes of the organisms , then by figuring out what all of those thousands of genes actually do . This new map of life is called genomics . " It 's quite a change to think that any of this is possible , " indicates Jeffrey Bennetzen , Purdue University 's H. Edwin Umbarger Distinguished Professor of Genetics . " Six or seven years ago , we would n't have even thought about doing these genomics experiments . " Over the past few years , however , new laboratory techniques have been developed that allow scientists to make discoveries that just a decade ago seemed impossible . The genomics revolution has been spurred in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genes . " Before , it might have taken us two years to determine the structure of one particular genome , " Bennetzen notes . " Now , we expect to do the same region in a couple of weeks . " Before genomic techniques were developed , if a scientist was interested in finding the genes that caused a certain trait , it was not unheard of for him to spend his entire career identifying those genes . That process required painstakingly comparing the genes of the plant or animal that had the trait with the genes of those in which the trait was lacking . With genomics , scientists take a different approach . They use automated equipment to map out rapidly the sequence of all the genes in an organism . Then , in a step that is still somewhat painstaking , they go back and figure out what each of those genes does . Although the gene sequencing of important organisms is obviously a finite activity , Randy Woodson , director of Purdue 's Office of Agricultural Research Programs , maintains that genomics is a field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The science of genomics is n't going to be over tomorrow . There will be a five- to 10-year period of intense activity , especially in the sequencing of genes . At that point , we will have come full circle and come back to a point where physiology and biochemistry and other sciences will be needed to understand the functions of the genes and how these processes work . " Bennetzen predicts that , when scientists understand all of an organism 's genes and what each of them does , they will have a nearcomplete understanding of how the organism works . " That 's it . That 's biology . That 's why genomics is such a big , blossoming field . Now we can understand an organism comprehensively . Of course , there are a lot of organisms out there . In the end , what genomics has as its goal is to understand all of the genes in all of the organisms on the entire planet . " Photograph Greg Hunt , a honeybee specialist at Purdue University 's Cooperative Extension Service , checks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bees . " // The idea that we may know all of the genes of all of the organisms on the planet may seem absurd . Consider , though , that the idea that someday there would be topographical maps for every continent , island , and speck of land seemed equally absurd to 15thcentury mapmakers . Biologists have an easier task before them in making maps of all living organisms than faced those early cartographers because , as surprising as it sounds to a nonscientist , the genes of nearly all living organisms are almost identical . Although the external differences are not subtle , most creatures are very much alike in their genetic codes . Humans and chimpanzees differ by less than one percent in their genes . " For example , on the surface , it would appear that cows and humans are very different , " Woodson points out . " Yet , when one examines the genes that make up a cow , generally the same gene or a version of the same gene is present in humans . The differences are very slight . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different plants , but they have a lot in common genetically . " The reason for this similarity , Bennetzen explains , is that nature does n't like reinventing the wheel . " Creation of new genes is very rare , maybe happening only a few times in tens of millions of years . " Scientists call this similarity " genetic conservation . " Once nature finds something that works , it sticks with it , even if the organisms are strikingly different . Twenty or 30% of the genes in a human may be the same as in a single-celled organism such as E. Coli or an amoeba , because these genes are necessary for any living organism . Likewise , the same gene might be found in humans and mice , but not in corn , which would indicate that particular gene is necessary for mammals , but not for plants . Nature takes this genetic conservation to some unexpected extremes . The eyes of an octopus and a human are created from different tissues when the body is an embryo , yet scientists have discovered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genes . " Twenty years ago , if you had told a biologist that the eyes of a human and an octopus arise from the action of the same gene , he would have thought you were being ridiculous , " Bennetzen suggests . Woodson says these slight differences in gene structure and gene function determine the amazing diversity in organisms . " The science of genomics will begin to unravel this mystery , opening up untold opportunities for the application of genetic technology to crop and livestock production , as well as to human health . " Making maps of plants Genetic conservation goes beyond just having certain genes in common . Plant scientists have discovered in the past few years that , if they determine the location of a gene for a specific trait in one plant , another plant in the same family is likely to have the gene in the same place .

Woodson , director of Purdue University 's Agricultural Research Programs , shows off a carnation bloom that will last several times longer than flowers commercially available . // This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve corn might be to study the genetics of sorghum . Com 's genome is three times larger than sorghum . By identifying genes for a desired trait , such as drought tolerance , in sorghum , researchers can know where to look for it in corn . Finding genes that allow crops to withstand drought , frost , heat , and other environmental stresses is important . Each year , these occurrences cause massive crop-yield losses-more , in fact , than those from insects and weeds . Ray Bressan , professor of horticulture and director of Purdue 's Center for Plant Environmental Stress Physiology , and Mike Hasegawa , professor of horticulture at Purdue , are using plant genomics to combat stress losses . A small weed that is a cousin to the mustard plant , Arabidopsis-which is to plant scientists what the lab mouse is to medical researchers-is leading Bressan , Hasegawa , and other scientists around the world to a better understanding of how plants withstand these stresses . Scientists use Arabidopsis to learn the function of plant genes . They do this by creating a mutant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maturity and studying it to determine the function of the missing gene . Purdue researchers have created more than 300,000 mutant plants , and scientists at other institutions have created hundreds of thousands of additional mutants . " For all practical purposes , the genome is saturated ; there has been a mutation for every gene , " Bressan indicates . Because plant genes are identical or very similar in nearly all species , information from these experiments will be rapidly applied to commercial crops . Bressan predicts that the accumulating knowledge about the biology of plants will cause almost unfathomable changes in agriculture , noting that scientists have learned as much in the past three years as in the previous 100 about how crops and other plants withstand environmental stresses . " We 'll soon be able to produce more crops with less pesticides , less fuel , less fertilizer , and fewer trips over the field . We 'll produce much more with much less . " A couple of years ago I would n't have predicted this . But I now think that within a decade it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stresses of early spring and late fall to such an extent that farmers could plant two crops of corn , soybeans , or wheat in the same field each year . " In February , 2001 , scientists made headlines when they announced that the human genome  --  the so-called " code of life " - had been sequenced , five years ahead of schedule . Although the Human Genome Project grabs headlines , perhaps the bigger story in biology will be in plant and animal genomics . The first benefits to society are likely to come from these areas , where it is comparatively easier to utilize genetic information . " Agricultural genomics is well behind human genomics , " Woodson explains , " But we can adapt the tools used in the human genome project to find solutions for problems in food much faster than drugs for human problems can be brought to the market . " Although genetic manipulation of crops and livestock has become quite controversial , agricultural scientists argue that genomics can benefit society without moving genes between species . " Understanding the genome of a crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organism 's genes , " Woodson indicates . " Once we know what every gene in an organism does , following a trait through a traditional breeding program becomes much , much easier . If you want to increase disease resistance in plants or animals , for example , you do n't have to grow the plants or animals to maturity and subject them to years of testing to see if the trait is there . You can look at their DNA and know whether or not the trait is there . " Putting genomics to work Here are three perhaps unexpected examples of how researchers at Purdue are using genomics : Genome techniques help save endangered and reintroduced wildlife . Small populations of them can die out because of problems brought on by intensive inbreeding . Gene Rhodes , a wildlife biologist , is improving the odds for reintroduced and endangered species through research into the genomes of the wildlife . " Genetic variation is the currency of evolution , " Rhodes notes . " By having a variety of genes in the population , the animals have the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of wild animals is faced with a crisis , such as a harsh winter or a new disease , they may all succumb if they are too genetically similar . If there is sufficient genetic variability , though , some of the animals will survive because they are better equipped to deal with the crisis . In some species , just a small fraction of the original genetic variation remains . " We 've seen this with the cheetah , with the northern elephant seal , and with hundreds of other species , " Rhodes points out . Photograph Ray Bressan , director of Purdue University 's Center for Plant Environmental Stress Physiology , examines experimental Arabidopsis plants , used to learn function of genes . // He identifies specific gene markers on the genomes of animals he is studying , then looks to see if markers are also found in the genomes of other individual animals . Local wildlife biologists then know whether they need to introduce new animals to improve the genetic variability . " Wildlife biology has never been one of the big biology thrusts . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning off technologies that we can use in wildlife management . " Improving the pollination of crops : Natalia Dudareva , assistant professor of reproductive biology in the Department of Horticulture , has found new insights into the genetics of floral scents that might result in sweeter  --  smelling roses , as well as a bouquet of other benefits . Improving floral scent is a goal of the $20,000,000,000-per-year floriculture industry , but it is also important to agriculture . Almost three-fourths of all crops depend on insect pollinators attracted by floral scents . Honeybees alone are responsible for pollinating one-third of U.S. crops . Many fruits must be pollinated multiple times to produce fruit , and the number of pollinations helps determine its size and quality . " For watermelon , it takes about 12 times to have quality fruit , and it takes 25 pollinations for strawberries to maximize berry size , " Dudareva notes . Improving the floral scents of fruit trees and plants would be a benefit for fruit farmers , she maintains . " Plants did n't evolve to produce their scents for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made about which plants to cultivate . " Stopping killer bee genes from entering North American hives : Highly aggressive stinging behavior in Africanized honeybees-the so-called " killer bees " - is disruptive to agriculture and can be dangerous to humans . Africanized bees are established in most of South America , Mexico , and the southern region of the U.S. Understanding their aggressive behavior is important for much of American agriculture , not just for honey producers , because , as mentioned above , onethird of the food produced in the U.S. come from plants pollinated by honeybees . Already , many beekeepers in Mexico have stopped maintaining beehives because of the Africanized species . There is a need for information to enable bee breeders to identify Africanized bees in order to prevent the spread of the stinging trait into commercial bee populalions in the U.S. Purdue University entomologist Greg Hunt , in collaboration with Ernesto Guzman  --  Novoa of Mexico 's agricultural research service , has used genomic gene-mapping techniques to locate those that influence behavior in Africanized bees . " We have developed specific gene markers that predict the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genes so it will be easier for breeders to avoid using them . Now that we have the markers , we can selectively breed for gentle bees . " The DNA markers are available to other scientists to investigate honeybee populations in their regions to determine if the genes for aggressive behavior have moved into their area . This research could also lead to the isolation of genes that influence bee behavior and suggest ways to decrease stinging incidents . As these three examples show , information from genomics promises to improve many aspects of our lives , not only through new drugs and improved crops , but by preserving wildlife and protecting the environment . " This is not a fad . It 's the best way to do biology , " Bennetzen argues . " When molecular cloning came on the scene , there were people in biology who said , It 's a fad . ' Now everybody does molecular biology ; nobody is called a molecular biologist anymore because it has become part of every biologists ' tool kit . In five years , genomics will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life science move into the field to a degree .
