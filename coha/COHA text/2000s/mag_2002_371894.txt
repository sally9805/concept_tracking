In January 1942 , Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivered his first wartime State of the Union address . Three weeks from now , George W. Bush will do the same . His speechwriters have been looking at Roosevelt 's words for inspiration , but the surprise is that , in many ways , F.D.R. may have had the easier task . <P> Where Roosevelt was worried that Americans feared the war would never end , Bush frets that Americans think the war on terror has already ended . Where Roosevelt called for a national mobilization against mighty villains , Bush must rally the nation against invisible enemies . And while F.D.R. focused solely on the long war ahead , Bush must leverage his newfound stature into domestic achievement . " There 's a real sense that we have to come up with some big , new ideas , " says a nervous White House official . " We have to show we 're not just sitting on our high poll numbers . " <P> With the Taliban vanquished , Bush has to start worrying about political enemies at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate Democratic leader who last week ended the unofficial ban on full-contact politics with a speech that clobbered the President for throwing away the budget surplus on a massive tax cut . Bush 's domestic agenda , Daschle charged , " is being written by a wing of the Republican Party that is n't interested in fiscal discipline . " <P> The President 's advisers are still debating how aggressively to respond to Daschle . Hard-liners argue that with Bush 's approval ratings hovering near 90% , now is the time to push a conservative agenda and dare the Democrats to oppose it . " Unless the President takes on Daschle , we will have paralysis , and voters wo n't be able to see distinctions , " says a House G.O.P. leader . But Bush favors a softer approach : calling for a continuation of post-9/11 unity and bipartisanship , thereby making Daschle seem shrill and churlish . At the same time , Bush knows that his father 's apparent blindness to the recession of 1991 negated his Gulf War triumph . So between now and his State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of public events designed to prove his empathy for Americans hit hard by the current tough times . <P> In his big speech , Bush plans to drape his arms around the entire nation , Democrats included . In an upgrade of his " Communities of Character " initiative that was shelved because of the September attacks , Bush will propose a range of volunteer programs aimed at harnessing the reawakened desire of many Americans to serve their community and give to charity . His big idea : to expand the Corporation for National and Community Service , which Bill Clinton created with the youth-service program Americorps.
