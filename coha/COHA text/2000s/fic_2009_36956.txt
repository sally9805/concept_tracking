In Ireland , two thousand people vanish every year . <p> The Irish countryside was quiet and the darkness was absolute , as it could only be far from the lights of a city . Here , beside the narrow road that led to Westport , the night felt empty , but for the squares of lamplight in the distance , marking the places where farmhouses stood in silence . <p> In the grassy field , ancient tombstones tipped and tilted crazily as if they 'd been dropped from heaven and left to stand as they fell . Trees bent in the wind , and their bare limbs clattered like a muttered conversation . A fairy mound rose from the ground and lay littered with wildflowers that looked black and white in the starlight . A sigh of something ancient whispered in the darkness , and far away , a dog moaned into the quiet . <p> A young woman stood in the center of the stones , as she 'd been told . She waited , impatiently checking her wristwatch and shrugging away the superstitious twitch at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough during the day , but at night , when the sky was black but for the stars , the woman half expected ghosts to rise up and chase her out of their graveyard . <p> The woman shivered again at the thoughts jostling through her mind and shrugged deeper into her coat . There was nothing to fear , after all . Had n't she grown up here ? Did n't she know this road to Westport well enough to travel it in her sleep ? <p> No , the only thing to worry her was that maybe the man she waited for had forgotten his promise to meet her . Maybe he was with someone else . Maybe <p> " Darlin ' , " a deep voice whispered from close by . " I knew you 'd come . I 've been waiting for you . " <p> She whirled around , a smile of welcome on her face . Something blacker than the darkness rushed at her . She screamed as a howl lifted into the air , and a moment later the cemetery lay empty in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alison Blair stopped dead and felt the small hairs at the back of her neck stand straight up . <p> The long , undulating howl still quavered in the air as she stared back down the road into the darkness . <p> " A dog , no doubt , " the guard at the wrought-iron gate muttered in an Irish accent so thick it almost sounded as though he were speaking Gaelic . <p> " Scary dog , " Aly muttered , turning back to watch as the big man studied her ID card . Frowning , she said , " It 's not a forgery , you know . " <p> He flicked a glance at her from under thick black brows , and she deliberately lifted her chin and met that stony stare with one of her own . <p> The man nodded in approval , then said , " There 'll be hell to pay when the boss hears you 've come . " <p> " I know . " As a member of the Guardian Society , Aly knew she would be as welcome here as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , Immortal Guardians were n't exactly the most hospitable people in the universe . They lived alone , worked in secret and protected their real identities from a world filled with people who would never understand . <p> Chosen at the moment of their death , the Guardians were given the choice of either moving on to whatever awaited them or accepting immortality and the task of defending humankind against the demon threat . The Guardians were devoted to doing their duty and in general preferred to do that duty with as little interference as possible . <p> Both from humanity and the Society . <p> The Society had existed as long as the Guardians themselves . Generation after generation the families who belonged to the Society had worked with the Guardians . Some of those Guardians reluctantly accepted the help of the Society , and some did n't . <p> Rogan Butler , Irish warrior and a Guardian centuries old , fell into the latter category . <p> " As you can see , " she said , reaching out to take the papers identifying herself as a Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I need to see Rogan Butler immediately . " <p> " He 'll not be happy . " <p> " Fortunately , " she said , " his happiness is not my responsibility . " <p> She really should have waited until morning to come and beard the lion in his den or lair , she thought , turning her gaze to the two-storied manor house beyond the iron gate . But she 'd flown in from Chicago expressly for this meeting , and she wanted it over and done with . <p> Of course , if her sister Casey had bothered to come along with her , Aly thought , she would n't be feeling so on edge . Strength in numbers , after all . But though she 'd been happy enough to come along on the trip to Ireland , Casey had insisted on reminding Aly that she was n't a member of the Society . Casey had been the first member of the Blair family for centuries to not pick up her hereditary calling . <p> And Aly remembered clearly the argument they 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You could come with me just for moral support , " Alison had said as she and her sister fought for space in front of the tiny bathroom mirror . <p> " Oh , right . That sounds like a good time . " Casey tugged at the hem of her V-necked , red T-shirt until it showed just enough of her breasts , then smiled at her elder sister . " Look , Aly , this secret-agent thing is your deal . Not mine . I did n't join the Society , remember ? " <p> Aly scowled , hip-checked Casey out of her way and pulled her long , thick blond hair into a ponytail at the base of her neck . Then she wrapped the elastic band with a dark blue scarf and let the ends trail across her shoulders . Staring into the mirror , she gave herself the once-over before answering her sister . Dark blue jacket , white button-down oxford shirt tucked into dark blue jeans and black boots . She looked fine . Businesslike but casual . Friendly but stern . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned from the mirror to face Casey . " Yes , I remember that you did n't join the Society . I 'm not asking you to be officially there . I was just looking for some company . " <p> Casey muscled her way in front of Aly to check her own reflection again . She fluffed her short , dark blond hair and shrugged . " I do n't know why you 're so nervous about this . Rogan Butler is n't the first Guardian you 've ever spoken to . " <p> " True . " Aly sat down on the edge of the bathtub , stretched out her legs and said , " But he 's the first one who refused to talk to me on the phone . And our psychics refused to call the Ireland office so one of their members could deliver the message in person , so " <p> Casey shook her head , fluffed her hair again and leaned in to smooth another layer of dark red lipstick on her mouth . When she was finished , she straightened up , smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jealous psychics . Are n't they supposed to be above all that ? " <p> " They should be , " Aly admitted . " But you know how they are . Especially Reginald . " <p> " You 're defining the reasons I did n't want to join the Society , Aly , " Casey said . " No way do I want to spend all my time trying to soothe cosmic egos . " <p> And maybe she had a point , Aly thought now , grimly steeling herself for her meeting with the Irish bully known as Rogan Butler . <p> " Well , then , " the guard said , his musical accent rising up and down as he spoke . " I 'll get the gate . Just drive on up to the manor . You 'll be met . " <p> Aly got back into her car and swallowed hard as the guard unlocked the gates and swung them open . She steered her car , absentmindedly noting the tidy lawn and the spill of golden lamplight pouring from the lead glass windows of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stomach pitched a little , and she told herself to get a grip . She would n't allow a Guardian to make her nervous . As a member of the Society , she had every right  --  no , a duty  --  to give him the information the Chicago psychics had discovered . <p> She parked the car directly in front of the double doors and stepped out , pocketing the keys . Grabbing her purse , she headed for the house and stopped dead when those double doors were pulled open and a giant of a man stood backlit against the entryway . <p> Rogan Butler . <p> It had to be . <p> His shoulders were broad , his hips were narrow and his legs were long and thick with muscles . His black hair hung loose past his shoulders and lifted in the icy wind like a battle flag . As she watched , he folded massive arms across an impressive chest and stared down at her . <p> " Alison Blair ? " His accent was , if possible , even thicker than that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder . Deep and powerful . <p> " Yes . " Apparently his security man had alerted him to her identity . " And you 're Rogan Butler . " <p> " I am . Why 've you come ? " <p> So much for niceties . " Because you would n't take my phone call . " <p> " I had no wish to speak with you . I still do n't . " <p> Limned in lamplight , his features were in shadow , but Aly did n't have to see his face to know he was frowning . She could feel his scowl , his irritation , flowing from him in thick waves . <p> Her nerves jittered a little , and for one moment she wished she were anywhere but there . But there had n't been another available Chicago Society member to make the trip , and the Society psychics so guarded their " visions " they had n't wanted to call Ireland and get one of the local members to deliver the message . <p> So , here she was . Facing down one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight to keep from getting back into her car and driving away . But if she did that , she 'd never live it down . <p> " The Society will find no welcome here . " He said it briskly , as if already dismissing her . <p> " We 're not your enemy , you know , " Aly countered quickly . " We 're on the same side . Fighting the same war . " <p> " Is that what you think , then ? " He came down one of the steps and stopped . " And how many demons have you fought , Alison Blair ? " <p> " None , but  --  " <p> " A thousand and more demons have fallen beneath my blade . All without the help you 've come so far to offer . " <p> " The Society is  --  " <p> " Useless ? " he offered . <p> " There 's no reason to be insulting , either . " She walked toward him , forcing her feet to move despite the fact that her muscles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place . " I 've come with an important message and I 'm not leaving until I 've delivered it . " <p> He blew out a breath and came down the remaining steps until he stood on the drive right in front of her . Aly tipped her head back to stare up into his eyes . Green , she thought . A shining , clear green that seemed almost iridescent in the pale light . His jaw was hard and square and bristled with a day 's growth of whiskers . His mouth was firm and flattened into a disapproving line , and his heavy black brows were drawn down on his forehead . <p> He was , without a doubt , the most gorgeous man she 'd ever seen . <p> And despite the fact that his irritation still simmered in the air around him , Aly felt a small twist of something hot and needy bubble into life inside her . <p> Which was just unacceptable . <p> " Fine , then deliver your message and be on your way . " <p> " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . " <p> " You 're a prissy little thing , are n't you ? " <p> " Prissy ? Prissy ? " Narrowing her eyes on him , she said , " I 'm an official representative of the Guardian Society . I 've just spent twelve hours in a plane to get here . Then I had to rent a car and try not to nod off at the wheel while I forced myself to drive on the wrong side of the road . " He opened his mouth as if to speak , but she kept right on , feeling her sense of righteous indignation build up and spill over . " The hotel lost my reservation , and my sister and I had to search for a local B and B. After getting to our room , instead of having a meal or taking a much-needed nap  --  or even , God help me , going for a drink with my sister  --  I got in that blasted car with the steering wheel on the wrong side of the damn thing and drove straight here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security thugs and now to be insulted by you . If it were n't in humanity 's best interests to give you this message , believe me when I say I 'd as soon keep my mouth shut , turn around and go home . " <br> Continues ...
