Where she 'd died was n't where she would be found . That was one of the few facts they would learn . A coastal marsh near the south Jersey shore , at the edge of the Pine Barrens . Where the incoming tide lifts the body , buoys it up then surrenders it by degrees back to the marsh . Like sleeping it must seem . To the dead girl . This slow rhythmic rising and ebbing , rising and ebbing of the tide . Like breathing . A stinging northeast wind off the Atlantic pushing through cattails , seagrass . By night , by day . Dusk , dawn . A ceaseless wind . A rain-swollen sky . Even by day the swamp is shadows . When the tide returns the body seems to awaken , floating again in shallow brackish water that has frozen on its surface , and now thaws , a dark glitter thin as the thinnest glass . A stippled surface in which filaments of cloud are reflected dimly . By night , a glaring full moon . High-scudding broken clouds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being blown from one pole to the other . Always the wind , always the tide ! While the naked , broken body lies on its back in the posture of sleep . Head turned too sharply to one side . The mouth is opened in a mute scream . A paralyzed scream . The mouth is a hole ridged in blood . The nose has been smashed , the jaws broken . The eyes are open in their blackened sockets , sightless . Long tangled hair rippling like seaweed when the coastal water returns . Always the tide returns , twice daily , in a quickened current , in gushes . The sun burns through the mist , the body is exposed . A dead body is a broken thing . Among so many broken things . Stumps of dead trees , dead vines . The naked , broken body is stirred by the incoming tide as if waking , returning to life . But scummy with coagulated blood . Dark patches defacing the body like swaths of tar . Bony wrists and ankles bound by wire . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh the wire is n't visible . Gulls swooping overhead , darting , stabbing with their sharp curved beaks . Their high , excited cries . Who would love this body now , who would dream of this body now ? Who would touch this body , now ?
