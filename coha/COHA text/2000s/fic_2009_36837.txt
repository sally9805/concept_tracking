" 911 ? I need to report a murder , " I said , clutching my cell phone in my left hand as I steadied the warm pizza box in my right . I should have put the pizza on the porch before I called the police . Instead , I was holding on to it as though it were the last life preserver on the Titanic . At least the heat radiating from the box felt good . We were two weeks past New Year 's , and though only dustings of snow had found their way to our part of the North Carolina mountains this winter so far , I knew it would n't be long before it would make its first full-blown appearance . <p> My voice was calmer than I expected it to be as I spoke ; I was startled to discover that I did n't really know how I would react to finding a body until it happened to me . <p> From the threshold , I glanced back in through the house 's doorway and saw the long black handle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a pool of dark liquid spread out on the floor around him that I guessed had to be blood , though I was in no hurry to confirm my suspicions . From the instant I 'd arrived , it had been pretty clear that there was no need to check for a pulse . <p> " Did you have anything to do with the homicide ? " the voice from the police hotline asked . I immediately recognized it as Helen Murphy . That was one of the advantages of owning a pizzeria in a small town : there were n't many folks in Timber Ridge , North Carolina , I did n't know . I 'd gone through school with Helen 's niece , Amy , and growing up , I 'd had dinner with the extended family on more than one lazy Sunday afternoon cooking out by the Dunbar River . <p> " Helen , this is Eleanor Swift , though I suspect you already know that . What kind of question is that to be asking someone ? I brought Richard Olsen the pizza he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him dead . " <p> There was a slight pause , and then Helen said , " It 's my job to ask these questions , Eleanor . Is there anyone else there with you ? " <p> I had n't even thought of that possibility . Could the murderer be hiding just behind the doorway , lurking in the shadows while he was waiting to make his escape ? I looked intently from my vantage point on the front porch , but I could n't see anyone inside . <p> That did n't mean no one was there , though . <p> " I do n't think anyone else is around . " But thanks a lot for putting that thought into my head , Helen . I owe you one . <p> Again , there was a slight pause . Then Helen said , " Do n't touch anything , Eleanor , and do n't go anywhere until one of our officers gets to the scene . Do you understand ? " <p> " Yes , ma'am . I 'll be waiting right here . " <p> I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the body , but it was dark , I was cold , and there was n't anything I could do for Richard , so I carried the pizza box back to my car and waited for the police . <p> I never should have been the one who found Richard Olsen 's body in the first place , but Greg Hatcher-A Slice of Delight 's number-one teenage delivery guy-had called in sick that night and left me shorthanded , though I suspected it had more to do with his girlfriend , Katy Johnson , than the flu he claimed to be experiencing . I 'd thought about turning the late-night order down since I 'd been hustling all evening trying to keep up with things at the restaurant , but my dearly departed husband , Joe , had taught me that every dollar counts , and I 'd kept his credo strong long after he 'd died and left me with a small business on my hands and a heart full of broken dreams . I probably should n't complain . Having the restaurant to run after Joe 's car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every right in the world to find the nearest hole and crawl into it . <p> I 'd shoved the pizza-one of my specials decked out with pepperoni , sausage , ham , bacon , hamburger , and little bits of sliced sirloin-into one of the bright red boxes I use and headed for the address I 'd been given on the phone . I had n't recognized the house number right away , but then again , I did n't know where everyone in Timber Ridge lived , despite what my sister , Madeline , thought . Maddy helped me out at the restaurant , but she 'd never made a delivery in her life . She claimed she was above schlepping pizzas all over our small town , but she was n't too good to run a rag over a table or carry a pie ten yards to a likely-looking bachelor . Maddy came to work with me after Joe 's death-coinciding with her most recent divorce-and despite a few relapses where we reenacted some of our childhood squabbles , it was good having her there with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I looked up as it skidded to a stop less than a foot from my rear bumper . As I got out of my car to meet our chief of police , Kevin Hurley shot out of his cruiser like he was jet-propelled . Kevin and I had a history , one that was n't all roses and wine , but at the moment it was great seeing his familiar face . I had n't realized how tense I 'd been while waiting for someone-anyone-to show up until he got there . <p> " Ellie , are you all right ? " he asked , and I could see the concern clearly in his face as we stood under the street lamp . Kevin was still tall and lean , a kid who 'd been one class behind me all through school , and was now a nice-looking man . A year did n't seem like all that much these days , but it seemed like a lot when I 'd been eighteen and he 'd just turned seventeen . Kevin had pursued me all one summer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night by Miller 's pond I 'd caught him parking with Marybeth Matheeny , and that had been the end of that . <p> I gestured to the house and said , " I 'm not the one you should be asking about . Somebody put a knife in Richard Olsen 's heart . " It sounded callous , the way I 'd blurted it out , but there was no other way to phrase it , at least not while my shaky nerves were starting to kick in . <p> " Stay right here , " Kevin said . <p> " Do n't worry . You do n't have to tell me twice . " <p> I leaned against my car and watched him enter the house as he drew his firearm . That long-ago summer Kevin had begged for my forgiveness , but I 'd been young and hurt , and I had n't been willing to listen to him . Two months after I 'd left for college , he 'd married Marybeth in a hastily arranged wedding , and seven months after that his son had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for me at the pizzeria three nights a week after school . Though Kevin and Marybeth had separated off and on at least three times in the past dozen years , she still bought her pizzas in Edgeview , even though it was fifteen miles from Timber Ridge . I did n't mind . I 'd never been all that big a fan of Marybeth 's in the first place . <p> An ambulance arrived a scant thirty seconds after Kevin disappeared into the house , and I nodded to the attendants , two of my regular customers . They rushed inside ; then after spending two minutes there , they calmly walked back out . <p> " He 's gone , " Hannah Grail said as she approached . " There was nothing we could do for him . " <p> Her partner , Dave Thornton , shrugged . " And now we wait . " He added with a grumble , " We 're not going to eat until morning . " I suddenly remembered the pizza box sitting on the passenger seat of my car . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waste , and it should still be warm . You 're welcome to it , on the house . " <p> Dave looked like he wanted to kiss me , but Hannah said , " Thanks for the offer , Eleanor , but we ca n't interfere with evidence . " <p> " Of what , the fact that I was delivering a pizza to Richard 's house ? It 's not like it was a murder weapon or anything . Nobody poisoned him , least of all me . Go on . " <p> Dave said to his partner , " She 's right . You do n't want her to have to throw it away , do you ? " <p> Hannah shrugged . " I guess not . " <p> I grabbed the box and handed it to them , and after thanking me , they went into the back of their ambulance to eat . <p> Kevin came out a minute later and looked around for the AWOL EMS techs . " Where 'd they run off to ? " <p> " They 're eating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste , so I gave them the pizza I was delivering to Richard . " <p> The chief of police frowned in their direction and said , " They should n't be doing that . " <p> " Come on , Kevin . That pizza never made it into the house . It 's got nothing to do with what happened to Richard , and neither do I. Now , can I go home ? It 's late , I 'm freezing , and my feet are killing me . " <p> He shook his head curtly . " I know what time it is , but I need to ask you a few questions first . " <p> " How long is it going to take ? " <p> Kevin smiled at me , and for a second I forgot he was our chief of police and thought of him as that teenage boy with a grin that could melt my heart back when I 'd been pretty innocent myself . " Less time if you quit complaining about it , I can promise you that . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me what happened tonight . " <p> " Richard called in his order . I made it and delivered it . That 's when I found him like that . " <p> He shook his head . " Come on , Ellie , I need more than that . " <p> " Sorry , it 's all I 've got . And it 's Eleanor , remember ? " <p> He shook his head as he said , " You never used to mind when I called you Ellie . " <p> " That was a lifetime ago , Kevin , and you know it . " <p> His only answer was a shrug . Then he asked , " Is n't it a little unusual for the owner to deliver pizzas herself ? I thought that was Greg Hatcher 's job . " <p> " Greg came down with a bad case of the lovesick blues . He said he was sick , but I suspect he was out with Katy tonight . It was n't a big deal . I cover for all of my employees now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few seconds , then asked softly , " And there 's no other reason you were visiting Richard Olsen 's house alone at night ? " <p> What was he trying to imply ? Then it hit me . " You think I was making some kind of booty call ? You 've been a cop too long , Kevin . You 'd suspect your own grandmother , would n't you ? " <p> " If she had the motive , means , and opportunity , I might , " he said , not rising to my bait . Nanna Hurley was a sweet old lady who thought a slice of apple pie would cure whatever ailed you . In other words , she was my kind of people . <p> The severity of Kevin 's tone finally struck home . " You ca n't be serious . Do you honestly believe I had something to do with what happened in there ? " I could barely bring myself to look at the house now . The shock of what I 'd found was finally sinking in . <p> He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at it from my point of view . You had the opportunity ; you 're the one who found the body . The knife was from his kitchen ; I saw the empty slot on the block of knives on his kitchen counter . That 's two parts of the murder triangle . " <p> " I had no reason to kill him , " I said . <p> He raised one eyebrow as he asked , " Are you forgetting the Harvest Festival ? " <p> I could n't believe he was bringing that up . " Richard was drunk , and he would n't take no for an answer . A good slap sobered him up long enough for him to realize what he 'd tried to do , and after that , we were fine . " Richard Olsen had tried to kiss me by the beer tent , even after I 'd protested that I was n't interested . I blamed Luke Winslow for not cutting him off sooner when he saw the man was clearly drunk , but to Luke 's credit , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open , stinging slap on Richard 's cheek . My handprint had still been etched there ten minutes later , and I was pretty sure everyone in Timber Ridge had seen my brand on his cheek . <p> Kevin did n't let up . " Are you sure it was n't some kind of lovers ' quarrel ? Maybe tonight you two finished whatever you 'd been arguing about at the festival . " <p> I was n't about to stand there and listen to his wild accusation . " Kevin , I 'm going home . " <p> He put a hand on my car door , stopping me from getting in . " I 'm just saying , you have to admit that this looks bad . " <p> " I 'm serious-you 're going to have to lock me up , or let me go . " <p> He reluctantly moved his hand , and I got into my Subaru and drove home without a glance back . <p> I sat in my driveway ten minutes before I realized I did n't want to be alone tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her apartment , and I figured she owed me a couple dozen favors , so it was time to cash in on one of them . <p> If it had been me , I would have been sound asleep at nearly eleven P.M. , but Maddy looked lively and alert when she answered her doorbell . <p> " Hey , what are you doing here ? " Maddy was tall and thin , while I was quite a bit shorter and had more curves than a backwoods mountain road . Growing up , we 'd both been brunettes , but sometime around her ninth-grade year , Maddy had decided that she was truly a blonde deep down inside , and she 'd dyed her hair and never looked back . Though my sister was two years younger than me , most days she acted half my age . <p> " I need a place to stay tonight , " I said . <p> She moved aside . " Well , come on in , then . I was just about to make some popcorn . Would you like some ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked into her apartment , a lively swirl of oranges , golds , and greens , and plopped down on her sofa . " Do n't you even want to know why I 'm here ? " <p> She shrugged . " We do n't need an excuse for a sleepover . " <p> " Richard Olsen is dead . " <p> Maddy did n't even look all that upset as she shook her head . " That 's too bad . What happened ? Was it a car wreck ? " <p> " Why would you ask me that ? " Even the sound of the two words linked together still gave me nightmares about losing my husband . <p> Maddy frowned . " I was on my way home tonight , and he nearly ran me off the road in that beefed-up truck of his . He looked like he was running from the devil himself . " <p> " You need to tell Kevin Hurley that , " I said as I grabbed my cell phone . <p> " Why on earth would I want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reason Richard was racing around town , and frankly , at this point , anything that diverts suspicion away from me is pretty welcome . " <p> That got Maddy 's attention . " Why on earth would he think you had anything to do with Richard 's car wreck ? " <p> " Because it was n't a wreck that killed him . Someone shoved a knife into his chest , and I found the body when I delivered his pizza . " <p> " That 's terrible . " Maddy frowned , then added , " Wait a second . I did n't take any orders for Richard Olsen tonight . " <p> " That 's true , he called right after you left . Since Greg was n't there , I decided to deliver it myself on the way home . " <p> " What are you going to do ? Oh , no , I bet Kevin said something about what happened at the Harvest Festival , did n't he ? " <p> " He did , but it does n't matter . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , " I said . <p> " You know that , and I know that , but the rest of Timber Ridge saw the imprint of your hand on Richard 's face . You almost took his head off . " <p> " He was drunk . I had to get his attention . " <p> Maddy grinned . " I 'd say you accomplished your goal , then . Give me that phone . I 'll call Kevin right now and tell him what I saw . " <p> After a brief conversation with our chief of police , Maddy handed my cell phone back to me . <p> " What did he say ? " I asked . <p> Maddy just shook her head . " He told me that he understood why I 'd lie to protect you , but that it was n't going to do anybody any good if I muddied the waters with rumors and lies about Richard Olsen . " <p> It was starting to sink in that I was in deeper trouble than I 'd realized . " This is bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's starting to look that way . But there 's nothing we can do about it tonight . Let 's make that popcorn and get lost in Bogart 's eyes . " <p> I stifled a yawn . " If you do n't mind , I 'm going to go straight to bed . I 'm beat . " <p> She nodded . " Absolutely ; I understand completely . Let me move a few things and you 'll be all set . " <p> We walked into her spare bedroom , and I saw four dozen little quilted squares lying on her spread . <p> " When did you start quilting ? " I asked . It was entirely out of character for the freewheeling woman she liked to portray to the rest of the world . <p> " It 's something I started doing when I 'm not at work , and I really enjoy it , " Maddy admitted . " I 've been reading Earlene Fowler 's quilting mysteries , and it seemed like fun , so I decided to give it a try . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy about mysteries , and she read every chance she got . As she devoured mysteries on candle making , card making , soap making , and more , she had to try her hand at each of the hobbies as well , sometimes with mixed results . For instance , her soap would barely raise a lather . At the other end of the spectrum , I had several of her exquisite handmade candles decorating my home . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
