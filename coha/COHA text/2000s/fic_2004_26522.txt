Bye , Bye , Love Chapter One Darlin ' Tommy J The first time she 'd heard his voice , sweet and clear , coming through the wire on this new thing called FM , Sally Alder had been totally , utterly gone . Gone , gone , gone , from the moment she 'd stood in the record store , looking for the album with the hit song , " Last Night , " and found herself staring open-mouthed at the photograph of Stone Jackson on the front . His penetrating , wounded blue eyes conjured a fantasy of passion and intelligence , a vision ignited again and again as she wore out the vinyl , reveling in his songs of warm whimsy and earthy blues , invitation and anguish , loss , love . Like there 'd been this instant connection between them . Fate . Destiny . Please . His debut album had gone platinum .

Not Sally . Truly it was embarrassing to admit it , but through albums , tapes , CDs , and live concerts , she 'd followed the heady highs and desperate downs of his story . She 'd dreamed , vividly , of hearing him say the words : " I need you to help me , Sally . " The precise words Thomas " Stone " Jackson was saying this very minute , sitting in her cluttered office at the top of Hoyt Hall , at the University of Wyoming , in the glory of the last fine day of September . The voice was the same : gentle , mellow , pure , hinting at irony . The long , graceful , string-bean body was just as she 'd admired so many times on stage , slung with a guitar , swaying with soul , bopping with the beat , rocking out . The face , however , had a whole lot more miles on it than the one on that long-ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence had been burned away , leaving sharp bones , arched brows , wry mouth . Crow's-feet winged at the corners of those everremarkable eyes . His forehead was deeply etched , and there was a whole lot more of it . Which mattered to her not a whit . She , too , was on the dark side of forty . Guys who managed to keep up appearances in the middle of the long strange trip suited her just fine . Still , experience had taught her to be wary of appealing men . Here came Jackson , saying he needed her help . Over the years , she 'd extended aid and comfort to enough guys to remember to check her wallet . " Why me ? " she asked Thomas Jackson , keeping her voice low , trying to sound neither eager nor suspicious . " Where 'd you get my name ? " " Our mutual friend , Pete , " Jackson explained , naming an old boyfriend of Sally 's who 'd had his own ups and downs , but was currently riding high in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've just bought a little place outside Cody , " Jackson continued . " When Pete found out I planned to spend time in Wyoming , he suggested that I look you up . " A little place ! Everyone in the state had heard about Thomas Jackson 's purchase of a prime property he called the Busted Heart Ranch . The brand ? What else ? Two offset halves of a heart . Next to Harrison Ford , Thomas Jackson was pretty much the biggest Hollywood rancher in Wyoming . " Oh yeah ? " she said . " That was nice of Pete . We keep in touch , from time to time . " Thomas Jackson grinned faintly . " Pete says you 're a nag and a bit of a diva , but that you 're brilliant , sexy , and can sing some . And that he 's had reason , in tight situations , to find you trustworthy . " " Pete 's definition of trustworthy is n't most people 's , " she replied , trying to ignore the fact that Jackson had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her old lovers . What was that , some kind of blas Hollywood move ? She went for Wyoming blas . " So what 's the problem ? " Jackson leaned back in the dilapidated easy chair usually occupied by students whining for grade changes . " You know Nina Cruz , of course . " Of course . Angelina Cruz , known as Nina : his ex-wife , folk singer icon . Nina had retired from the fast lane in L.A. to seek peace of mind in a gracious , but relatively modest , log house on eighty pretty acres west of Laramie , a spread she called Shady Grove , near the town of Albany , Wyoming . Nina was an ardent wilderness lover , animal-rights activist , and feminist . She drove a Range Rover with bumper stickers that said , MY OTHER CAR IS A BROOM and FRIENDS DO N'T LET FRIENDS WEAR FUR . She had once told Sally she believed that , at the deepest level , plutonium , the endangerment of species , and professional football all came from the root toxin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buena in southern California for la vida blizzard in southern Wyoming ? Nina for one , evidently ; Sally for another . Sally had left UCLA to direct the Dunwoodie Center for Women 's History at the University of Wyoming . She and Nina had feminism in common , though Nina was the type of feminist who believed that all women were extensions of the earth goddess , and Sally was more inclined to the view that women and men were all too human , equally capable of Nobel Prizes and bonehead moves on a planet ruled less by goddesses than by chance and choice . But Nina was also the kind of feminist who wrote big checks . Sally was the kind who cashed them . When Nina 's first substantial donation to the Dunwoodie Center had arrived , Sally had called Nina to say thanks and invite her to dinner at the Yippie I O Caf , the only place in Laramie one dared take a vegetarian to dine . They 'd since had several cordial dinners together , and , happily , more checks had followed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center , " Sally said carefully ...
