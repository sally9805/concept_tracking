Photograph above : ' Sarah Bernhardt ' peonies bloom with volumes of soft-pink petals . left : Semidouble selections , such as this rosy pink one , appear to open more easily than some fully double ones . // When the first huge peony unfurls into a flounce of petals , you want to touch it , wear it , and live somewhere inside that magnificent bloom . The perfume , lifted by latespring air , ca n't be inhaled deeply enough . You hope it will last forever . Such giddiness is a springtime ritual in the Upper South . There , peonies become large , shrubby plants festooned with flowers . Divided and passed along for generations , peonies are a long-lived legacy . But move them to the warmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peonies need cold winter weather to flourish , and without sufficient cooling , few flowerbuds are produced . Greg Jones , with Gilbert H. Wild and Son in Sarcoxie , Missouri , is an expert on their cultivation . " We 've found that peonies need about three to four weeks of cold-around 32 degrees . But every variety has a different cooling requirement , " he says . A herbaceous perennial , peony ( Paeonia lactiflora ) has flowers and foliage that emerge from large buds or " eyes " on tuberous roots . In the Upper and Middle South , the eye should be covered by an inch of soil . But in the Lower South , place it barely beneath the surface . " You want the eyes as close to the top of the soil line as you can get , so the plant can benefit from cool winter temperatures , " Greg says . Avoid mulching peonies , because this insulates the roots and prevents sufficient cooling . Surefire Success Peonies are considered potentially poor performers in the Middle and Lower South , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big part of how well you 'll do with peonies , " says Rick Berry with Goodness Grows in Lexington , Georgia . " Here , we recommend partial shade , preferably with protection from afternoon sun . " Peonies grown in full sun often suffer leaf scorch by midsummer . The plants go dormant early , preventing them from building up food reserves . This reduces flowering the next year . In filtered light , however , peony foliage continues growing into late summer or early fall , storing energy for the following year 's blooms . Peonies do not require fertilizer when planted in good soil . " If you consider the beautiful ones you see in cemeteries , plants that have been there 30 years with virtually no attention , you realize they do just fine without supplemental feeding , " Greg says . However , in many parts of the South , gardeners are faced with heavy , clay-based soil , which lacks the necessary nutrition . In these areas , apply Holland Bulb Booster after bloom , following the directions to prevent overfeeding . Photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fragrant bouquet .

The simple white bloom with a burst of yellow is pure elegance . // Soil preparation is importantpeonies falter in wet conditions . " They do n't want to be in soil that holds moisture , " Greg says . So dig a large , wide hole and amend the soil with leaf mold or soil conditioner , which is available at garden shops . To plant , mound the improved soil inside the hole . Then place the roots with the eyes just below the soil surface , facing up . This ensures adequate drainage and aids winter cooling . What To Buy The selection you choose may determine how well your peony blooms . " We 've found that early-blooming and semidouble ones generally do very well in the South , " Greg says . " There are also some really beautiful doubles that do well , but they should be the early kinds too . " Many Southern gardeners believe the single varieties perform best in warmer regions . Dependable peony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Bowl of Beauty , ' and ' Kansas . ' When you order by mail , the plant you receive will be bare root . This means it is not actively growing and not planted in soil . " Order your peonies in spring , when you can see what the blooms on plants in your area look like . You should n't receive your peony until fall when it is shipped dormant , " Greg says . If planted immediately , the peony will resume a normal growth cycle in its new home . If you plant peonies in the spring , avoid bare-root plants . Instead , look to garden centers and nurseries where you will find them already growing in large containers . The Truth About Moving " They say you should plant a peony for life , " Greg says . " What that means is that a peony will easily live for 50 years . It does n't mean you ca n't move it . " The time to relocate a plant is late fall , when it 's dormant . After the foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant , and carefully lift the roots . Replant it as you would a new peony . " Have patience . It may take several years to become established and bloom well , " Rick says . Peony blossoms tug at heartstrings and perfume the air with an oldfashioned fragrance . Take the challenge , and enjoy the rewards . <p>
