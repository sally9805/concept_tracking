<p> The very new Old Town Brasserie is all about experience . Seasoned restaurateur Bob Djahanguiri ( Yvette , Toulouse , Turbot ) working the front of the house , Roland Liccioni ( Le Francais , Les Nomades ) in the kitchen . I would never have put these two together in a hundred years , but it is working like a charm . <p> The menu is as tight as a drum , but it booms with authority . Some of the dishes are listed in French with English subtitles , while others go with English alone . The subtle message I read is , " we are serious about this food , but do n't take it all to seriously . " The proof is on the plate . <p> And then there are the eye-boggling prices . Boggle in this instance means more than reasonable ( actually a bargain ) considering the quality , finesse and impeccably honed flavors that prevail . Twenty-three dollars for loup de mer . Eight bucks for a souffle ( four flavors to choose from ) . Sixteen dollars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nage de homard ) . I want to eat here for a week straight before they raise the prices . <p> Finesse ? I 'll say . Liccioni knows how to fashion sauces the way Armani does clothes . Sauce merguez . Sauce Perigueux , sauce champignon ... this attention to the food-sauce connection takes years to hone , and Liccioni has never been sharper . If you never got to try his food at Les Nomades or Le Francais , this is your chance , and at easy-to-digest prices . <p> There will never come a time when fizzes , powders , and foams will replace substance and solidly good cooking . I point to the elegantly conceived duck consomme at Old Town Brasserie . A double consomme classic that clearly was done right . Nicely presented , rich with flavor ( a la duck ) and made even more enjoyable with the addition of an elegant truffle ravioli . All that for $6 . Amazing . <p> I could trot out a stable of tasty adjectives for another starter  --  lobster ravioli facon Vietnamiene . The obviously house-made ravioli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried several poached shrimp on its back . All of this was swaddled in an indulgent lobster sauce . A " salad " of pickled cucumber completed the dish , which was quite delicious . <p> What would a bistro or brasserie be without pate maison ? As the menu notes , the pates are " house-prepared , " and quite good . The arrangement consisted of slices and dabs of chicken liver mousse , country pate ( pork-based ) and duck rillettes . Accompaniments were the standard cornichons , mustard and slices of toasted brioche . <p> Entree choices consist of three seafood , duck , rack of lamb , beef , veal and chicken . Nothing startling there , but it 's the sauces and little extras that make the difference . For example , a special one night was slow-roasted prime rib . Outstanding bit of work . Three slices of rosy-pink rare beef were so good , so imbued with the true flavor of beef ( not a morsel of fat anywhere ) , that I slipped into my slow-eating mode in order to savor every bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthy ragout of mushrooms , a couple of brussels sprouts and seared coins of fingerling potatoes . Good stuff , but the star of this plate was that incredibly delicious beef . <p> Roasted veal chop is listed on the menu , but as our server so nimbly pointed out , " the veal chop has left the house and has been replaced with veal hanger steak . " Works for me . Natural rich beef flavor , sliced , medium-rare , served with silky garlic-laced spinach and a couple of pommes frites . <p> The one seafood dish sampled was the nage de homard . Translation : " Oil poached lobster , seared scallops and Israeli couscous , lobster sauce . " It arrived exactly as described and then some . A good portion of sweet lobster meat and three plump seared scallops were arranged over the couscous ( a joy of its own ) . Bringing this all into perfect harmony was the rich and ravishing lobster sauce that was nothing more than a mirror on the plate , but reflected quite beautifully the affection the kitchen has with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion . Hazelnut , chocolate , Grand Marnier and raspberry are the choices . It was the Grand marnier . Served in a cast-iron souffle dish , the souffle top rose a good two inches over the rim . The golden brown top was pierced by the server and the sauce was poured in . You can share this , but you may not want to . <p> " Chocolate moelleux " is a fancy name for a turban-shaped warm chocolate cake gussied up with a raspberry ganache , chocolate sauce , and thyme ice cream . Nothing extraordinary , but nothing was left on the plate either . <p> Pat Bruno is a free-lance writer , critic and author .
