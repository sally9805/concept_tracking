Eve , the reigning queen of gangsta rap , sweeps into the New York City radio station Hot 97 with the same you-can't-stop-me air Allen Iverson has when he steps onto a basketball court . She 's dressed way past the nines  --  she 's hovering around the elevens  --  in purple boots , purple Anna Sui leather pants and a black mink coat . Her hair , once platinum blond , is arranged in cornrows dyed a shade of red that almost makes the braids appear to glow , like space-heater coils . Eve does an on-air interview hyping her new CD , Scorpion ( Ruff Ryders/Interscope ) , and then records a few attitude-filled promos . " Who 's that girl ? " Eve asks . " I 'm that motherf girl ! " When the session concludes , Eve softens . Her dog , Spunky J. , a teacup terrier so tiny it 's more of a cat than a canine , scrambles into her arms . Eve coos , " She 's like a baaaby ! " <P> It 's tough being a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose co-workers at Ruff Ryders include DMX , a guy whose musical canon features What These B Want and other numbers that will never be chosen as theme songs for Oprah . ( " DMX is one of my best friends , " Eve says . " That 's like my dog for life ! " ) Hard-core female rappers  --  Foxy Brown , Lil ' Kim  --  compete with male rappers by using sex as a weapon . Eve has found a balance : she 's tough enough to run with the big dogs and sensitive enough to hug a small one . Her 1999 debut , Let There Be ... Eve  --  Ruff Ryders ' First Lady , was uneven , but it established her persona  --  sexy but not pornographic , in your face but somewhat introspective . Now Eve feels she has improved . " On my first album I was like , ' Whatever you say , ' " she says . " This album I was like , ' Hold up . I 'm not doing that . ' This is more me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey , hails from Philadelphia , a city that in the ' 70s and ' 80s was known for music , basketball and cheesesteaks and then went through a period during which it pretty much had only cheesesteaks going for it . Now Philly music ( and b-ball ) is making a comeback . " Philly has always had a music scene , " says Eve . " I think we 're just hungry again . " <P> Although Eve , 22 , worked for a brief time as a stripper ( " That was probably my biggest struggle " ) , she nursed dreams of becoming a singer . She soon discovered that rapping got more attention . Eve made it onto the roster of Dr. Dre 's Aftermath Entertainment label , only to be let go , and then found a home at Ruff Ryders . She reunites with Dre on Scorpion ( he produced two tracks ) . Says she : " I was like , ' He better do something on my album  --  he dropped me from his label . ' " <P> While her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new CD is glossier and more ambitious . It 's loaded with guest stars , including No Doubt 's Gwen Stefani , reggae royalty Damian and Stephen Marley , and Eve 's boyfriend , producer Stevie J. Her rapping is more controlled and confident , though she sometimes sacrifices coherence for rhythm , spouting half-thoughts and sentence fragments just to keep her flow going . <P> A few months ago , drained by career pressures , she experienced a depression . Says Eve : " My self-confidence was really low . " But she recovered , she says , by strengthening her relationship with God . Now she hopes her album will be a source of strength to others : " I just want women to know how strong they are . " Having taken her bite of the apple , Eve now wants to share .
