Chapter One We die with the dying : See , they depart , and we go with them . We are born with the dead : See , they return , and bring us with them . - T.S . Eliot , The Four Quartets It 's alive ! Alive ! - Colin Clive as Dr. Henry Frankenstein , Frankenstein She 's alive ! Alive ! - Colin Clive as Dr. Henry Frankenstein , Bride of Frankenstein Who 's going to believe a talking head ? Get a job in a sideshow ! - Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West , Reanimator At first glance Deirdre looked human . Of course , Deirdre always got more than just a glance-even back when she was human . Once upon a time she had been a stunning beauty with pale skin , blue eyes , and auburn hair . That was before she died last year . In death she was transformed by the twinned viruses the undead carry in their blood and saliva . As a vampire she had gone from " stunning " to " unearthly " on the beauty meter . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sapphire eyes replaced by haunted rubies and her skin a whiter shade of pale and as luminous as the moon . The fangs , of course , went without saying . But she had undergone another extreme makeover in drinking my mutated blood a few months ago . Now her sharp , pointy teeth were all but gone . More obviously , her skin was approaching themocha and cream shade that came from a daily regimen of sunbathing-something you rarely see in a redhead and never in a vampire . Which was the point , I suppose , as Deirdre was no longer technically undead . My unique hemoglobin did n't make her human , again , you understand . The crimson eyes were an obvious clue that she was no longer the girl next door . That and the fact that she could still bench- press a small truck . But while I could n't give her back everything that she had lost in her original transformation , she seemed content : being " un-undead " suited her just fine . If only Deirdre 's situation suited Lup , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I needed a security chief and bodyguard who was conversant with the unique nature of my enemies , could stop a bullet without flinching , and could-well-bench-press a small truck . She also understood the unique obligations involved as ( technically speaking ) I was the one who had brought Deirdre " over " and ( literally speaking ) I was the one who had brought her " back . " Lup knew something about blood-bonds and curses and debts-that-do-not-die even when we do the mortal coil shuffle . Still , Deirdre was major eye candy . Worse , she had made it clear that , when it came to swapping body fluids , we need n't limit ourselves ( as we had on the two previous occasions ) to blood alone . It required frequent reminders to all and sundry that my heart belonged to Lup . Deirdre , it seemed , had someone else 's heart right now . She was holding it in the palm of her hand . And it was convulsing as if it were still alive . " Where did you get that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of my vision . She held the squirming cardiac muscle toward me , oily red fluids drooling between her fingers and sheeting down her arm . " Do n't you recognize it ? " She smiled demurely . " It 's yours . " I looked down at the gaping dark hole in my chest ... And awoke in a tangle of sweat-soaked sheets . * * * The upside to having daymares on a regular basis is that you stop going through that whole disorientation phase and learn to wake up real quick . The downside was that they were lasting well past sunset and I still woke up feeling exhausted . I groaned out of bed , hoping I had n't murmured Deirdre 's name while Lup was in earshot . Even when she 's in human form , Lup does n't have to be in the room to be within earshot . In the bathroom I found a note taped to the medicine cabinet mirror . Gone for groceries and DVDs . Movie night tonight ... L I reached through the shower curtains and wrenched the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a lot to do and I could n't waste time trying to put a Freudian spin on today 's bad dream . Even if there was a good chance I would get my heart ripped out before the sun came back up . * * * T.S . Eliot 's " Little Gidding " begins with : " Midwinter spring is its own season / Sempiternal though sodden towards sundown , / Suspended in time , between pole and tropic ... " The dead of winter in Louisiana is something like that : short sleeves one day , a sweater the next . Tonight , the weather had n't made up its mind . I buckled my shoulder holster over a sleeveless tee and shrugged into a flannel shirt but left it unbuttoned so I could reach the Glock-20 loaded with silver frag-ammo under my left armpit . Opening the screen door , I stepped down and walked barefoot through the January chrysalis of my new back yard . The brown , withered grass sighed beneath my feet , not quite dead , not quite alive . Like me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to late February-the lawn would burst forth with new life while I would be ... well ... what ? All flesh is grass but , where most folks end up succumbing to the Lawnmower of Life , some of us cheat the mulching process and come back as ghastly perennials . Considering the last eighteen months of my so-called half-life , there was probably a fertilizer analogy I could come up with ... but I did n't want to go there . I stepped on a mushroom and felt it dissolve between my toes . Forget the green stuff ; a pale , nocturnal parasite was probably a better analogy for my condition . That 's me : a real " fun guy . " Buh-dump-bum . By now you 'd think there would be a clear-cut diagnosis of my actual condition . But , no : I was left with two starting presumptions . One , that I actually died in the automobile accident that killed my family and was " reborn " in the hospital morgue ... Or , two , that I was only presumed dead while " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healing trance . Lacking the combinant factors of " Virus B " that resided in the old vampire 's saliva , the infection started converting my body into something new-neither fully human nor technically undead . Add to either scenario the subsequent contaminants and blood-borne pathogens from my encounters with Kadeth Bey 's tanis leaf extract and the demon-laced blood of Elizabeth Bthory-well , the " either/or " factor became rather hazy . And while the distinctions seemed important to some , I had to wonder : in the end did it really matter ? My wife and daughter were still dead and the Las Vegas Demesne was booking odds on me attaining the same status within the month . But this was n't the night to think about depressing things like vampire vendettas and daymares concerning misplaced hearts , it was an evening made for romance ! A sliver of moon hung over the graveyard like a leprous grow-light in Death 's terrarium . The wind had freshened , bringing the odor of distant rain and nearby rot . I could see a storm was finally brewing and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Lup and J.D. ever got back from Blockbusters , that is . I reached into my pocket , fished past my grandmother 's ring , and retrieved a small vial of Mentholatum . I rimmed my nostrils with ointment before continuing to the far end of my property . One minute I was alone , the next I was outnumbered three to one . You might think that the ability to see into the infrared spectrum would give me all sorts of advantages . But infravision is worth diddly-squat when the creatures coming at you have no body heat . The dead were a dozen yards away before I finally saw them . Three corpses shambled toward me ; their clumsy , unbalanced rhythms reminiscent of a trio of winos in fully soused search-mode for the nearest liquor store . The one in the middle looked freshly dead while his wingmen had been in the ground a great deal longer . They stumbled to a stop against the waist-high stone wall that separated the cemetery from my backyard . Unfortunately this was n't a dream : the stench of dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its forward momentum , slamming past the menthol barrier and up into my nostrils like a slow-motion train wreck . I sneezed and set a brown paper bag on the ground . " Yo , Csjthe , " the big one on the left said . It sounded more like he was sneezing , in turn . The proper pronunciation of my last name , " Chay-tay , " requires a tad more articulation than most decomposing tongues and palettes can muster . I stood about a foot back from the stonework on my side and tried to breathe shallowly . " Boo , " I greeted , " Cam . " Boo grinned ; Cam nodded . Boo was scary when he grinned . Cam was scarier because he could n't . In " The Mending Wall " Robert Frost wrote that " good fences make good neighbors . " I wonder if Bob knew how well that analogy extended to graveyards . In point of fact , however , it was n't the cemetery wall that kept the dead off my property . My real privacy fence was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete partitions that bordered my property on three sides . Do n't get me wrong . I get along pretty well with a lot of the **31;620;TOOLONG . But some of them just are n't real clear on the issue of boundaries . Hey , if they 're out of the ground-major clue ! Until Mama Samm came and put a hoodoo barrier around my property I had endured a nightly parade of rotting corpses to my back door . Some wanted help in matters of unfinished business , others were just lonely . Still , there had to be some limits . Now I just replaced the salt every month or so . More often when it rained . " This here 's The Professor , " Boo said , indicating the cadaver between them . Cam sort of nodded . A suicide , Cameron had propped a double- barreled shotgun under his jaw and tripped both triggers as his last living act . While the mortician 's art has come a long way the funeral was still a closed casket affair . Cam is n't geared for post mortem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell Johnson so I politely refrained from asking after Gilligan or Mary Ann . He did , however , look as if he was in a state of shock . It 's really hard to tell with the freshly dead ; they all have that look of mild surprise or severe disappointment . " You 're not real , " he said . I 've been told that I have " issues " but that was n't what he meant . " Well , of course he ai n't the real Baron Samedi , " Boo said . " Do n't matter , though . He 's still **29;653;TOOLONG . " I sighed . " Ombudsman . Except I ai n't . Are n't . I 'm not , " I corrected . It did n't matter that I was n't the Vodoun Loa of the Dead : half of the corpses in the cemetery still believed it , the other half did n't care . There 's something in my tainted blood that draws them to me like moths to the flame . " Aww , he 's just modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's not real , " The Professor insisted . " You 're not real ! " " Huh ? " said Boo . " I am asleep . This is a dream ! " " A dream ? " I looked around . " Looks more like a nightmare to me . " " Hey ! " said Boo . A moldy green hand rose up and gripped the top of the crumbling wall . " And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , " intoned a new voice . In life it might have been deep and resonant , in death it sounded wheezy and clotted , as if the speaker were missing a lung and had something stuck in his throat . Something like roots and leaves and cemetery earth . " ... some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt . The prophet Daniel , chapter twelve , verse the second , " the new corpse finished , dragging itself more or less erect to lean against the stone barrier . Well , hell , Preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ones are we ? " I think the new arrival was attempting an expression of contempt-something hard to pull off when you do n't have the complete palette of skin and muscles to work with . " He 's got a point , Jerome , " I said to the cadaver whose Pentecostal proclivities had earned him the nickname " Preacher . " " Ole Boo , here , has never given evidence of having any shame whatsoever . " Cam wheezed as though he was laughing . The Professor squeezed his eyes shut and looked as if he was wishing himself back into his bed . " Atheists , " Jerome scolded . " Now hold on there , Preacher , " Boo puffed , " that ai n't entirely true . By strict definition I 'm an agnostic and Cameron , here , was Unitarian . I 'm bettin ' that The Professor is one of them secular humanists . Right , Doc ? " " Organized religion is nothing but codified mythology mixed with superstition , " The Professor said , still careful to keep his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , " dedicated to logic and the scientific precepts . " " Yes , " he said , easing one eye open . " Boy , are you in deep doo-doo ! " " How about you , boss ? " Boo asked . I considered the rows of aged and crumbling headstones . " I do n't know anymore . " " If you so-called agnostics would read the Bible- " " ' O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave , ' " I interrupted , " ' that thou wouldst keep me secret , until thy wrath be past , that thou wouldst appoint me a set time , and remember me . ' The Book of Job , chapter fourteen , verse the thirteenth . " They all stared at me as if I had grown an extra head . Reaching down , I pulled an old book out of the sack . " eBay 's gotten pricier of late ; Jerome , but I got you the Kbler-Ross . " I handed it to born-again dead man . " Josephus ? " he queried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know there 's a copy in the West Monroe library . " " I 'm not kyping library books for you , Jerome . " " I 'll give it back when I 'm done . " I shook my head . " You do n't take care of them . It 's not your fault , considering your present address , but I think it 's best if we get you your own copies . " " What you need books for , Preacher ? " Boo shifted his grasp on The Professor 's arm as he tried to pull away . " Ca n't you just pray to God for your answers-you bein ' so righteous and all ? " " Now , boys , " I soothed , " we 're all just doing the best we can to figure out how it all works . " " And some of us , " Boo added , " are trying to figure out why we 're not already in heaven instead of slumming with the sinners on the slag heap of the dead . " Jerome turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , actually , it was more of a shamble-off-in-a-huff kind of thing . " Hey , " the big corpse called after him , " have you tried hopping ? Maybe y'all got ta jump-start that Rapture effect ! Beam me up , Jesus ! " " That 's not very nice , " I said . " Aw , he 's always askin ' for it . " But he did look a little ashamed . " And what am I gon na do ? Piss off God ? Oooo , He might strike me dead ! No , wait ... He might banish my soul to wander the earth after I die ! No wait ... " " Alright , you 've made your point . " I rummaged through the sack and pulled out a packet of oddly shaped dice . One die had eight sides , another ten , and yet another twenty . " Advanced Dungeons &; Dragons game dice , " I read off the package and handed it to Cam . " You play D &; D ? " It was a rhetorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetorical question . " E &; E , " Boo answered for him . " What ? " " Ectoplasm &; Exorcists , " he elaborated . " Plays with the Gorsky twins over in the northeast plots . " I just looked at him . " You know ... you 're kibitzing at a sance and suddenly a fifteenth-level exorcist bursts into the room and begins reading from the Roman Ritual . What do you do ? " I shrugged . " Make a savings throw ? " I reached into the sack and pulled out another book . " Here , Boo ; Norman Mailer 's The Naked and the Dead . " As I handed it to him , he relaxed his grip on The Professor , who wrenched himself free and ran back into the mists of the cemetery . " Oops . Guess we 'd better go fetch our newbie before he finds a way off the grounds and really stirs up a ruckus ! " As he turned to go , he ruffled the pages of his new present . " Hey , no pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not necrophilial porn . " He shrugged , took a step , and then stopped . " Hey , Hoss , I think we got company . " ( Continues ... )
