No one can argue that men and women see things from two different worlds . And when it comes to dating , some would venture to say they even view the first date differently-or do they ? " Of course they do , " says relationship expert-author Myreah Moore . Women are usually looking for a husband on the first date while men are just enjoying the company of a date , says Moore . " We girls , unfortunately , will see a man and get emotionally attached really quickly , " says Moore , dubbed " America 's dating coach , " who coauthored the book Date Like A Man To Get The Man You Want ! " On the first date we 're putting his last name with our name and thinking about a nine stores for the right dress at the right price , but when it comes to a relationship , they want it to appear immediately . " Moore encourages women to date more to avoid being clingy , appearing anxious and believing that " he 's the one " after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is n't . " Women are more desperate on the first date because they are dating-deficient . Women have no perspective of what they want . They just want to be in a relationship , " says Moore , who currently shares her expertise on TV 's " The Other Half . " " If you 're good at dating , " she says , " you know it 's a numbers game . It 's a seek-and-find mission to see what you 're looking for so that down the line when it comes , you 'll know it . " Photograph Art " Chat Daddy " Sims , host of the Chicago-based Original Real Deal Ultimate Relationship Chat , believes that society 's fast pace and changing times have made men and women view the first date the same way-with caution . // Men take their time when dating , she says , because they have more confidence and are n't emotionally charged on the first date . " They believe there 's no hurry . They believe there is an abundance of good women , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be available . They enjoy the process . " People are so dishonest and untruthful about who they really are these days that both men and women approach the first date with caution , says Art " Chat Daddy " Sims , host of the Original Real Deal Ultimate Relationship Chat , a Chicago-based informal meet-and-greet party where singles convene to network and discuss relationship topics . " So many people have been hurt in relationships , " he says . " Women are worried about somebody trying to get over on them and men are worried that women are n't who they say they are because we live in a world of weaves , false nails , breast implants , etc . . Men and women go on the first date cautious and leery of where the relationship is going . People used to believe in love at first sight , but now you 're required to investigate more . " Sims recognizes that women are more prone to get excited about first dates because they are looking for " old fashioned romance and charm . " Men , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about and where the date can lead . " Most people who are up to no good are quick to ask you out on a date because they are quick to get into some dirt . A dog will take you out in a minute , " says Sims . The ball is often in the man 's court on the first date because he ultimately determines if he 'd like to take the woman out for a second date , says Dr. Tiy-E Muhammad , professor of psychology at Clark Atlanta University . But that does n't stop some men , says Dr. Muhammad , from approaching the first date like some women-hoping to find marriage material . " A man knows if that 's the one ' on the first date , " he says . " Men do think she could be the one ' until she gives him a reason to be taken off the pedestal . But instead of the man not seeing her anymore , he 'll hang around and might have sex with her . On the first date , men are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is someone they want to spend a day with or a lifetime with . " He says women fall into two types : the pedestal woman and the idea woman . " Men view all women as a pedestal woman . The pedestal woman is a 10 . She has no flaws and is at the top of her game . She 's all he could wish for from a physical observation . When the woman does n't measure up to his standards or he does n't find her to be compatible with him , a woman becomes the idea woman . She is a 5 . She 's mediocre . After the conversation or intercourse she drops to an idea woman . " Photograph Women look for a potential husband on the first date , while men are looking for someone they can be compatible with , says licensed relationship and sex therapist Dr. Tiy-E Muhammad . // When she becomes an " idea woman , " usually she " is n't the one , " but instead of a man not dating her anymore , he 'll stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muhammad that men often go the distance even when they know after the first date that a relationship wo n't be pending . " Men will give it a fair chance , " says Sims . " They will keep it going if that woman is n't for them . They usually stick in there because there may be something they want later . They want to see where this will go . Men have a certain level of curiosity that women do n't have . When you 're not rocking a Sista 's boat , they want to go . Men hang around . " The essential thing that both men and women must remember on a first date is to follow their inner spirit and not force something to happen . Dr. Muhammad concludes , " Follow your instinct . Ladies , stop trying to make him what he is n't . That first date lets you know . Trust that gut instinct . Do n't settle .

Stop being naive . The first 15 minutes are crucial on the first date . " <p>
