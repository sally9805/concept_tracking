We were n't overly concerned when our 12-year-old daughter first started receiving phone calls from a boy we did n't know . To be perfectly honest , we were actually a little relieved . Heather had been going through a rough time with a group of girls at school . They had singled her out because she dressed differently and listened to different music from the rest of the crowd . Try as she might , Heather always seemed to be out of step with the junior high social scene . Now she was getting calls every night from a boy in her class who she clearly liked a lot  --  or at least that 's what she wanted us to believe . Call it father 's intuition : My husband , Kevin , had a sixth sense that there was something funny about these phone calls . So one day he decided to dial Symbol Not Transcribed69 to find out who was really calling . Neither of us was prepared for what he discovered : The calls came from California and the " boy " who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university student she had met online . Symbol Not Transcribed Symbol Not Transcribed Symbol Not Transcribed Heather had met Doug at a fan Web site for her favourite musical group about six months earlier . They posted to one another on the site 's bulletin board and then , as the relationship evolved , moved their conversations to private e-mail . As the months went on , Heather became convinced that she had found her true love  --  her soulmate  --  and that some day they would find a way to be together despite the geographical and age distances between them . Spending time with Doug became her top priority , even if that meant setting her alarm for 3 a.m. so she could chat with him online for a couple of hours while the rest of the family slept . Not surprisingly , Heather 's fixation with her online boyfriend began to send shock waves through the rest of her life : Her grades slipped significantly and she became less and less interested in the " real " world . By the time we found out about the relationship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much lost interest in anything other than the Internet and him . Given what had been going on at school , it 's not hard to see why she was so susceptible to this cyber stranger . He told her she was funny , smart and beautiful  --  music to any 12-year-old girl . Graph Not Transcribed We took Heather to a counsellor and made it clear to her that she would not get Internet privileges back until she had made some significant progress in counselling . Heather 's counsellor warned us that we were treading a fine line by severing her access to the Net : If we pulled the plug entirely , we might succeed only in driving the relationship underground . A better strategy , she felt , would be to allow Heather limited access to Doug while establishing some clear ground rules for the relationship : She must route all e-mails through the family account  --  not some secret Hotmail account  --  and the relationship was to move from a " boyfriend-girlfriend " to a " brother-sister " plane . Heather reluctantly agreed to these terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of friends she had made at the music Web site and , of course , with Doug . At the same time , we would work with her teacher and principal to resolve the bullying problem at school . If things improved there , she 'd become less dependent on her relationship with Doug and more interested in life in the " real " world . Or at least that was the theory . Kevin and I had our doubts about going this route ; our instinct was to deny Heather any access to this man . But the counsellor led us to believe we had little choice . We had gone through some heartbreaking times with Heather  --  she 'd already made attempts to injure herself by deliberately cutting her wrists and ankles with a sharp object . It was an agonizing decision , but I did n't want to drive her to more desperate measures by making her feel she had nothing to live for . As unhealthy as her relationship with Doug might be , it had become something of a lifeline . Symbol Not Transcribed Symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be going well . The bullying stopped and her time offline had given her the opportunity to form some friendships at school . She seemed less dependent on Doug . But within about six months , she began leading a double life again . Heather began using covert tactics . At night she turned off the ringers on the phones so we would n't know that Doug was calling her in the early hours of the morning . Using allowance and birthday money , she started purchasing $25 " pay as you go " phone cards to add more calling time to the family cellphone in the mistaken belief that such calls were untraceable . She edited the browser history in both Netscape and Internet Explorer to remove any links that would lead us to discover what she and Doug were talking about . She set up a labyrinth of Hotmail accounts so that her e-mails to and from Doug could bypass the official e-mail account on the family computer . And she got in the habit of meeting Doug in password-protected private chat rooms . She also became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her screen . Then she slipped up . She forgot to delete one particular link in the browser history  --  a link that led us to " cheesecake " photos that Doug had uploaded for Heather to see . Doug with his pants unzipped , his penis bulging inside his underwear . Doug with his pants pulled down to the tops of his legs , his genital area blocked off with a black box marked " censored . " Doug holding a present he 'd bought for Heather . Doug with Heather 's name scrawled across the back of his hand . That sealed it : Kevin and I agreed we had to take drastic steps to end the relationship now that it had moved into sexual territory . It was one thing to have our daughter receiving e-mails telling her how wonderful she was ; it was quite another to have her exposed to semi-nude photos sent to her by someone who clearly had a sexual interest in her . We spoke to Heather 's counsellor , consulted a lawyer and sought advice from law enforcement agencies and Internet safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flabbergasted by what we discovered . While a 22-year-old who sends these types of images to a 12-year-old is clearly doing something reprehensible , what Doug was doing was n't illegal . In fact , he could have sent Heather nude photos of himself and still stayed within the letter of the law as long as those photos did n't illustrate activities that could be legally defined as pornographic . Since we could n't charge Doug , we opted for a different strategy . We installed keystroke-monitoring software on our family computer . This allowed us to obtain login information and passwords for all of Heather 's e-mail accounts so we could hack into them . The monitoring software allowed us to see that the relationship had strayed into very scary territory indeed . The conversations were sexually explicit and they were talking about the day when it would be legal for them to have real sex . They were also starting to make vague plans to get together  --  if not in the immediate future , then someday . Doug was becoming increasingly controlling and manipulative , trying to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her , and she was starting to believe him . We filed a complaint with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the United States so that it would have a record of Doug 's activities in case he crossed the line from legal to illegal . We contacted Doug 's mother to let her know what her son had been up to and asked for her assistance in controlling his online activities . We told Heather in no uncertain terms that the jig was up . She would not be allowed to communicate with Doug any more . Period . Heather was upset with the verdict at first , but she bounced back more quickly than I would have predicted . When we told her , she seemed more concerned about losing touch with another Internet friend  --  a girl named Kelly from Nova Scotia  --  than in severing her relationship with Doug .

But what we do know is that we 'll be much more vigilant in supervising Heather 's online activities when the time comes to let her go back on the Net . I still find it hard to believe that this happened under our watchful eyes . We had made a point of closely monitoring Heather 's Internet activities . We had placed our family computer in a high traffic area of the house  --  right smack in the middle of our home office and within three feet of the business computer , which one or the other of us is using virtually nonstop . We 'd taken pains to spell out our family 's Internet safety rules . Heather knew it was unsafe to talk to strangers online and she could put herself at risk by divulging personal information such as her name and telephone number . Unfortunately , that was n't enough to keep her out of trouble  --  not when she hooked up with a sweet-talking stranger who knew the right things to say to a lonely and vulnerable preteen . Looking back , I think Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in and put an end to her relationship with Doug . She had become increasingly uncomfortable with his decision to take their relationship into sexual territory , and had nagging doubts that he might be some sort of predator . She said as much to me one night a few weeks after we 'd cut off her Net access . She and I were watching a documentary on cyber predators , and I asked , " Do you ever worry that Doug could be a predator ? " " At least once a week , " she replied . And I know she thought it was " weird " of him to send her the photos of himself with his pants unzipped . While I 'd like to think this will mark the end of the whole Heather-Doug saga , I 'm not as naive as I was a year ago . I ca n't police Heather 24 hours a day , so there 's always a chance she 'll call Doug from a pay phone or send him an e-mail from a friend 's computer . And I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online . ( Thankfully , she gave him the brush-off . ) Yet I 'm encouraged by the small things . The other day , I watched as she breezed by the home computer on her way out the door to meet some friends at the mall . For now , it seems living her life offline is more fulfilling than the covert , flat-screen world of the Internet . Denise Andrews is a southern Ontario mother of four .
