SCOUTS VIEWS PATRIOTS It 's hard to say they are starting to show signs of slipping until it really happens . They 've lost some key guys , but they lose key guys every year . As long as they have that quarterback and coach , they 're going to be pretty good . ... Ben Watson is a tough mismatch at tight end . He 's a 4.5 guy who 's about 6-3V2,255 . He 's too fast for linebackers and too big for safeties . ... Kevin Faulk is a big part of what they do in terms of being a change-of-pace , third-down back . DOLPHINS I think they 're the team to beat in this division . They just need another back to complement Ronnle Brown . It 's pretty hard for one back to carry the load . ... In the last couple of years , they have n't been a threat as a passing team . Now , with Daunte Culpepper , the threat of the deep ball becomes a factor .... They 're going to have a whole new crew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that holds up . BILLS The quarterback situation is not real good . J.P . Losman has all the skills in the world . It just depends on how much he can pick up the new offense . Kelly Holcomb is probably the safe pick , but he does n't have the arm to go downfield like Losman . ... Aaron Schobel is a really good player at end , but you do n't hear a lot about him . He plays with a real high motor and is good both playing the run and rushing the passer . JETS Chad Pennington may surprise people every now and then with a deep ball , but he 's not a deep-ball thrower . His only way of surviving is if the Jets use a lot of short , quick , rhythm passes .... Kimo von Oelhoffen is a try-hard guy who will do all the dirty work at nose tackle , but I do n't see him replacing John Abraham . He 's a decent player but not spectacular . He does n't scare me .

He spent the offseason working out hard and honing his fundamentals , such as getting his hand on top of the ball so his deep throws float instead of dive . Brady means business . And after having a sports hernia repaired , he 's in good physical condition and presumably at his peak mentally . This team has more questions than usual , but Bill Belichick wo n't panic . Mis steady hand quells locker room discord . He is a terrific game manager who is masterful at putting players in positions to thrive . The re-signing of RE Richard Seymour erases a distraction and keeps an excellent line intact . Seymour , LE Ty Warren and NT Vlnce Wllfork are as good as any defensive front in the NFL . Look for the Patriots to benefit from a schedule that includes four division games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weak NFC North and games against the Texans and Titans . REASONS FOR CONCERN : There are problems at wide receiver . David Glvens is gone , and Delon Branch ( holdout ) and rookie Chad Jackson ( injury ) were absent almost all of camp . Chargers castoff Reche Caldwell had an average camp and is n't suited to be a No. 1 receiver . Finding a capable inside linebacker to play next to Tedy Bruschi has been a problem . Monty Beisels struggles caused the team to sign Junior Seau , 37 . Mike Vrabel may have to move inside , though he is most comfortable outside . Bruschi may not be able to start right away because of a broken wrist . Adam Vinatierl , who may be the best clutch kicker in NFL history , is gore , and rookie Steve Gostkowskl will have to make pressure kicks and master the tricky conditions at Gillette Stadium . CURRAN 'S BOTTOM LINE : It may be rocky at times , but the Patriots will remain an elite team . Look for the terrific talent at tight end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maroney to offset the wide receiver issues .

Anything . 2 Miami DOLPHINS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : RB Ronnie Brown has looked exceptional in camp and is poised for a breakout year . He believes he can carry the load in the backfield by himself ; he did n't have the chance to do it while backing up Cadillac Williams at Auburn and sharing the backfield with Ricky Williams as a rookie last season . Brown added muscle in the offseason but has the same explosive first step . Look for him to catch more passes , too . The defensive line may be old-all four starters and the two key backups are 30 or older-but it still is tenacious and can get to the quarterback.Ttie group returns almost intact from last season , when the club tied a franchise record with 49 sacks . Miami is 3-8 in its past 11 December road games , but it likely wo n't have the late-season blues this year ; it has three home games in December and a game at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis.The lone cold-weather game is December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes , glaring problems remain in the secondary.The newcomers-rookie S Jason Alien , CBs Will Alien and Andre ' Goodman and FS Renaldo Hill-have n't shown they are any better than the players they replaced . The offensive line will look much different , but will it be improved ? Rex Hadnot is moving from right guard to center , and free-agent pickup LJ . Shelton has replaced Damion McIntosh at left tackle . The unit needs to mesh quickly to properly protect QB Daunte Culpepper , who needs to show his surgically repaired knee can withstand a full season . If Brown suffers an injury , the team will turn to Sammy Morris . He is a capable backup , but the offense could be in trouble if he has to be the primary back . DARLINGTON 'S BOTTOM LINE : A healthy roster and good chemistry likely will help the Dolphins climb back to elite status , but they still have plenty to prove before they can be considered Super Bowl contenders .

" I do n't remember how he spells it , but that 's how it reads . Worst thing about our locker room : The offensive line does n't have enough space . We 've got the same size lockers as the punters . We 're big dudes . Cheapest teammate : Seth McKinney wears the same khaki shorts and the same rock " n ' roll shirt every day.The guy only has one outfit . Most wired : Tim Davis ( assistant offensive line coach ) must hook himself up to an outlet at night . He 's always charged up . Can't-miss weekly dining tradition : Betty 's Soul Food . I go there every other night . I eat baked chicken , cabbage , fried okra , and I might get some corn or some sweet potatoes . Unique lockers : The rookies ' ' .

Buffalo BILLS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : Coaches plan to use RB Willis McGahee more as a receiver and take advantage of his speed by running more sweeps and off-tackle plays . His 61-yard touchdown in the exhibition season might indicate McGahee has regained the breakaway speed he had before his knee injury in 2003 . By getting him the ball in space more , the team believes explosive plays will follow . OLB Takeo Spikes has recovered from a torn Achilles ' and has looked good in drills ; he 's showing lateral movement and quickness . Spikes , MLB London Reicher and OLB Angelo Crowell will form one of the NFL 's best linebacker trios . Lee Evans is ready to be the team 's No. 1 receiver . He has reliable hands , great body control and breakaway speed . REASONS FOR CONCERN : QB J.P . Losman won the starting job but must prove he can be consistent . Losman has a strong arm and his mobility allows him to keep plays alive , but he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Losman will avoid some sacks with his legs , but the line is susceptible to bull rushes up the middle and has trouble dealing with elite speed rushers . The team ca n't afford injuries on the line because there is n't much depth . The new defensive philosophy calls for linemen who are quick enough to penetrate gaps and disrupt plays in the backfield , but the front four 's lack of size could be a problem when the team faces power running teams with big , physical blockers . Besides Evans , the Bills do n't have much they can count on at receiver . Peerless Price is conning off disappointing seasons in Atlanta and Dallas . Josh Reed has n't lived up to his second-round status . Roscoe Parrish 's rookie year was ruined by a broken wrist . WILSON 'S BOTTOM LINE : This is a rebuilding year . The quarterback position is n't solidified , both lines have much to prove , and the team is learning new schemes .

Road trip I like most : Cincinnati has been good to me . I 've always had good games against those guys . There 's so much hype surrounding my returning there . I 'm an energy guy , so just what the crowd brings along fires me up . I feed off that . Funniest trash-talker : Out of all the trash-talkers , I like Steve Smith because he 's straight to it . He 'll tell you , " All right now . Be careful what you ask for . " Or he 'll say , " When you get home , your kids will know my first and last name . " He does n't pull punches . He will cut you to the bone . 4 New York JETS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : QB Chad Pennington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery on his shoulder . His arm strength remains average , but he 's throwing with more velocity and accuracy than he did a year ago , when he was struggling to recover from the first surgery . The offensive line , a major weakness last season , has nice potential . LT D'Brickashaw Ferguson and C Nick Mangold , two rookies , are solid building blocks . Ferguson is an elite athlete with a chance to become a shutdown pass protector . Mangold is a heady player with better than advertised athletic ability . The young secondary could be very good . FS Kerry Rhodes and CB Justin Miller are fast and athletic . REASONS FOR CONCERN : The Jets do n't have any offensive players who will force defensive coordinators to adjust their game plans . That will put extreme pressure on Pennington and the line . One question that remains with Pennington is whether he can get the ball to the perimeter , especially on deep outs . If he ca n't , opposing defenses will pack the middle and take away his favorite throwing lanes . Kevan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack home run ability . At wideout , the Jets have a group of tough possession receivers , but none can stretch the field . Rookie WR Brad Smith , a former college quarterback , has breakaway ability as a runner , but he 's raw as a receiver . The team traded its best pass rusher , RE John Abraham , to the Falcons , which created a major void . LE Shaun Ellis has double-digit sack potential , but he 's a power rusher who is n't going to attract many double-teams . The defense faces a tough transition to the 3-4 because the personnel fits better in a 4-3 . But coach Eric Mangini is hellbent on playing the scheme he used with New England . Neither Dewayne Robertson nor Klmo von Oelhoffen is a natural nose tackle , Bryan Thomas never has played outside linebacker , and Jonathan Vilma could struggle at inside linebacker . In the 3-4 , Vilma wo n't have two big tackles keeping blockers off him . CIMINI 'S BOTTOM LINE : Sorry , not this year.The Jets simply are n't equipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation for the future , establishing Mangini 's philosophy and finding the players who buy into it . - Rich Cimini STARTING LINEUP OFFENSE WR Laveranues Coles 3 LT D'Brickashaw Ferguson 3 LG Pete Kendall 3 C Nick Mangold 3 RG Brandon Moore 3 RT Anthony Clement 2 TE Chris Baker 3 WR Jerricho Cotchery 2 QB Chad Penninqton 3 FB B.J.

He was is screaming and hollering . All of a sudden , he stopped and said , " My bad , I 'm sorry . " He &; snapped back into his right mind . Unique locker : Kimo von Oelhoffen 's . He 's got about 20 cell phones in his locker , with cords and stuff everywhere-a lot of electronic stuff . Player I most hate to play against : LaDainianTomlinson . He 's a beast to tackle one-on-one . He gave me nightmares last year . Most wired : Bryan Cox ( assistant defensive line coach ) . He 's definitely the most wired .
