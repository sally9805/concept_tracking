THERE IS A LONG-STANDING HOLLYWOOD FANTASY ABOUT HOW to succeed in American politics . From Mr. Smith Goes to Washington to Bulworth , the story is the same : the hero is liberated when he breaks free from political convention and starts speaking from the heart . In the old days , Mr. Smith fought political bosses . Nowadays the bosses are political consultants . Senator Bulworth  --  in Warren Beatty 's 1998 film  --  is liberated after deciding to commit suicide while watching his re-election ads . <P> Reality , unfortunately , is stingy with outspoken political heroes . Mavericks tend to lose , even compelling ones like John McCain . There is a reason for that : inconvenient truths are inconvenient to someone . And passion can be scary . McCain 's assault on Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell cost him dearly in the 2000 campaign . Howard Dean 's anger was causing him to lose altitude long before he screamed . Which is why politicians have concocted an entire industry  --  the polling and consulting wizardocracy  --  devoted to telling them what not to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the one who says , " My crystal ball says , Do n't go there " or " If you say that , Your Majesty , the Goths wo n't be happy . " <P> The modern tricks of the wizardocracy  --  polls and focus groups  --  are not inherently malevolent . They are only as banal as the people who read them . Bill Clinton was a master : it was a focus group that taught him that it was better to " invest " in education than to " spend " on it . Clinton also knew when to ignore the polls , as he did on the Mexican bailout . Most pols are n't so clever , though . This year John Kerry and George W. Bush are relying on ancient market-tested formulations like ( in Kerry 's case ) " Health care is a right , not a privilege " and ( in Bush 's case ) " You know how to spend your money better than the government does . " Which leads me to wonder if the golden age of campaign wizardry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem shopworn this year . <P> Take polling , please . The vast majority of Americans  --  as many as 90% , pollsters have told me privately  --  refuse to answer questions when the wizard calls ( although the number is marginally better this hot election year ) . People who use cell phones exclusively , mostly younger voters , are unreachable . The wizards say they can correct for these things , by " weighting " their polls  --  that is , giving disproportionate weight to members of underrepresented groups like young people . But surely that makes polling less scientific and more speculative . It means polls should be trusted only to verify broad shiftsBush moved ahead in the presidential race after the Republican Conventionrather than specific point spreads .
