Having lived with my girlfriend for almost a year and a half now , I 'm often asked when I 'm going to get married . Most of the people asking are my girlfriend . And to her I say , How are we going to make a marriage work if those people on Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire ? could n't ? They had an entire television network behind them . All we have is my pushy grandmother . <P> But now , through TV , I 've learned that I do n't have to take this marriage thing so seriously . In fact , the whirlwind process of annulment seems kind of sexy in its own right . I picture myself , freshly annulled , in a leather jacket and sunglasses , telling Diane Sawyer how the marriage was part of my crazy , impetuous youth . A crazy , impetuous youth , Diane , that could get crazier if you 'll marry me right here on network TV . <P> But while the Fox show helped me lighten up on the concept of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates , the rest of America still takes it seriously . If the show had been about two people being sent on a vacation without the ceremony , it would have got The Dating Game 's ratings because it would have been The Dating Game . But add a ring , some vows and a dress that looks like a doily , and newsmagazines from competing networks will cover your TV special . Getting married to a stranger is a daredevil stunt far more fascinating than jumping a train on a motorcycle , which Robbie Knievel did on Fox later that week to much lower ratings . That 's partly because stupid Robbie did n't include a bikini contest . <P> As the institution becomes more fragile , we 've become even more attached to the symbolism . As shown by the Defense of Marriage Act , people get apoplectic at the thought of gay weddings because they fear that puncturing the traditions of marriage would expose the weakness of the institution . Also because gay weddings would make straight weddings look bad . <P> Still , I needed to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faith but also do it so publicly . I called Genie Francis , whose character , Laura , on General Hospital married Luke in 1981 in a major TV event . Sadly , their marriage is not doing well . Luke separated from Laura last year after discovering that she slept with Stefan , Luke 's archenemy , when she was kidnapped on Cassadine Island , though at the time she thought Luke was dead . Of the Fox show , Francis said , " That woman got a $35,000 diamond ring . That 's a lot more than I got paid for that episode . " <P> I do n't want to offend Luke and Laura , who seem to have had some very unfortunate troubles , but these contrived marriages seem doomed to fail . Maybe getting hitched after a first date is romantic , but to me , it means more when a commitment evolves without depending on the powers vested by a church , state or a TV network that pushed that Action show way too hard . <P> For now , I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our 500-sq. - ft. studio apartment . Some have called this a cruel test to put her through , but so far , she wo n't agree to the bikini contest .
