His love affair with Harley-Davidsons is n't what makes Robert McElwee the rarest of Roman Catholic priests . What sets him apart is that he shares this passion with his wife . <p> As Catholic leaders in America confront a worsening shortage of priests , McElwee is one of a handful of reinforcements to arrive , family in tow , from the ranks of Protestant clergy . <p> He is revered for his energy , devotion and humor by most of his parishioners in Frontenac , a predominantly Catholic town of 2,600 in southeast Kansas . But the wiry , bearded former Episcopalian - father of six , grandfather of three - refuses to see himself as a reason to question the celibate priesthood . <p> " I 'm not the avant-garde , " he said in his office behind Sacred Heart Church . " I 'd be disheartened if I convinced people that married clergy is a good idea . " <p> Indeed , he calls himself a " bigamist " - married to both the priesthood and his wife , remorseful that pastoral commitments make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush off to perform last rites for a dying man moments after his youngest son was born 16 years ago . <p> " It 's a major source of guilt , " he said . " There are days when I know I 'm shortchanging my family . A lot of things they do , they do without me . " <p> McElwee , 53 , and his wife , Ginger , grew up as nonbelievers . They married in Wichita when each was 19 , and he eventually was ordained as an Episcopal priest . <p> Both found themselves drawn to Catholicism , however , and they decided to convert because they felt many Episcopalians were too tolerant of abortion . <p> Their conversion coincided with Pope John Paul II 's decision in 1980 to allow some married Episcopal clergymen to become Catholic priests . Fewer than 100 have done so since then , and McElwee - after more than a decade performing other pastoral tasks - three years ago became one of the very few to be assigned traditional parish duties . <p> Ministering to his Frontenac flock is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 or more hours a day . He teaches five mornings a week at the Catholic high school in neighboring Pittsburg , oversees the Catholic student center at Pittsburg State University , works as a licensed marriage therapist and is chaplain at a Catholic hospital . <p> Ginger McElwee said her husband 's pastoral duties take a toll on the family even as they strive to support him . <p> " He has this enormous responsibility to constantly be available to everyone - he is responsible for their souls , " she said . " As a wife or a child , you ca n't compete . You ca n't say , ' I 'm sorry , I want you to drop that person . You were supposed to take me out to dinner . " ' <p> Mrs. McElwee took up motorcycling a few years ago , partly to increase the odds that some of her husband 's scarce free time could be spent together . <p> " The whole family has to constantly put the parish first , " she said . " It can be difficult , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The strain is financial as well as emotional . McElwee says the family is in debt . His wife - who works part-time at a quilt store and teaches psychology at Pittsburg State - worries that their only car may soon need replacement . <p> " As bright and well-educated as my husband is , if he spent as many hours at any other job , we 'd be rich , " she said . <p> Like his parents , 16-year-old Jordan McElwee - the youngest child - does n't think married priests are a wise idea . <p> " I 'd never recommend it , " said Jordan , a sophomore at Frontenac High School . " I do n't get to see my dad a lot - he 's on call all the time . " <p> But there are moments that offset the fatherless birthdays and holidays , when people tell Jordan how grateful they are for some kindness or assistance from his father . " That 's pretty cool , " Jordan said . <p> Bikers in the region also appreciate McElwee ; scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each spring for the " Blessing of the Bikes . " His business card bears the motto , " If I 'm not guiding , I 'm riding , " and motorcycle posters and models adorn his office . <p> Having worked at various pastoral jobs in Pittsburg for a decade , McElwee was known to many - but not all - of Frontenac 's Catholics when he took up parish duties three years ago . <p> " We have a very traditional parish - lots of elderly Italians , " said Jim Barone , a state senator from Frontenac . " The talk on the street when he arrived was , ' Oh boy , this will be interesting . ' But within a few weeks , he won everybody over . " <p> McElwee recalled some troubling moments . <p> " I 've had people get up and walk out of Mass who 'd say , ' I 'd no more take communion from you than from an adulterer , " ' he said . " There are obviously people uncomfortable with me being a priest - I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that most of his parishioners support him , but he hopes they also support the church 's policy favoring priestly celibacy . <p> " Being married makes you a better person , being a parent makes you a better person - if you do it right , " he said . " Being a celibate priest makes you a better person - if you do it right . " <p> The church 's music director , Sharon Barone , is one of McElwee 's biggest fans , yet she shares his view on married priests . <p> " This poor man strains himself to the limit , and does n't wish that on anyone else , " she said . " His family has to be very special , because he is pulled in so many directions . " <p> However , some parishioners - having seen McElwee in action - wonder if more men should n't have similar opportunities . <p> " He 's so good with people ; he understands the problems families have , " said Shirley Menghini , who has served on Sacred Heart 's church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about , having more married priests . " <p> As grateful as McElwee is for the papal dispensation that allowed him to become a married priest , some devout Catholics consider the policy unfair to their own corps of clergy . <p> Thousands of Catholic priests have left the active ministry in recent decades , often to marry . <p> Though barred from administering church sacraments , many strive to remain engaged in pastoral work . Through groups like Rent A Priest , they offer to provide counseling or preside at marriages , baptisms and funerals held off church premises . <p> Among those still trying to follow a priestly vocation is Bill Pfeiffer , 63 , a priest for 13 years in Pennsylvania who had to give up parish duties when he married in 1976 . He and his wife run a retreat in Hebron , Conn. ; he also teaches Latin at a nearby high school . <p> The whole family - including six children - remain practicing Catholics , but Pfeiffer feels the church is wrong to exclude married priests like himself while accommodating former Protestants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice on the part of the institution . Anyone can see that , " Pfeiffer said . " We 're really in need of a married clergy , not because of the shortage of priests , but because it 's simply right . " <p> He says his experience as husband and father is invaluable in the counseling he does . <p> " Being married is part of the reason people come to you , " he said . " You 've been through the same ups and downs . ... Being a father takes you places your heart would not otherwise have gone . " <p> His wife , Cynthia , says the church will run woefully short of priests unless it opens the door to married clergy . And if that happened , she said , the presence of husband-wife teams at the helm of a parish would eventually pave the way for women to become priests . <p> " Family life is in a very bad situation in our country right now , " she said . " We need role models . " <p> Unlike Pfeiffer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is now the priest at St. Peter 's by the Sea , an Episcopal church in Narragansett , R.I. , with a wife and two grown children . <p> He quit the Catholic priesthood in 1969 partly in protest against the Vatican 's condemnation of birth control . Since his marriage in 1970 , he has become deeply skeptical of the Catholic emphasis on celibacy . <p> " When I was Catholic priest , I used to think I was pretty good in the way I dealt with marital situations , " Ruffino said . " Now I look back and realize I did n't know squat ... Being married gives me a much deeper appreciation of the everyday realities of the people I 'm preaching to . I feel much closer to them . " <p> The " pastoral provision " program that enabled McElwee to become a Catholic priest is coordinated by the Rev. William Stetson from an office in Washington , D.C. <p> Stetson said the church has been trying to meet parishioners ' needs for marital and family counseling by increasing the numbers of married couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But married priests like McElwee should remain rare exceptions , Stetson said . " We have to make certain sacrifices to preserve a treasure of the church , which is celibacy . " <p> McElwee believes most Catholics - had they a choice - would prefer to confess to a celibate priest than a married priest . He believes the priesthood has a supernatural aspect that would be diminished by making its members more like everyone else . <p> " If someone becomes a priest only if he can be married , he 's becoming a priest on his terms , " McElwee said . " Becoming a priest is n't just something you do - it 's something you are . It has an equal claim on you , if not more so , than your marriage vows . " <p> Even though her husband is pulled in two directions , Ginger McElwee is determined to support him . <p> " One guy was telling me what a lucky woman I was , to have such a wonderful husband , " she said . " I felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how lucky he is that he has me . " ' <p> End Adv for Monday , Feb. 19 <p>
