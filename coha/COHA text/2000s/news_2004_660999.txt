<p> Americans love their lawns - so much so that they 've planted some 30 million acres of them - from the White House to the California desert . <p> If you lumped them all together , they could cover an area the size of Mississippi . <p> But concerns are rising that those lush , weed-free lawns represent an environmental hazard . The problem is n't the lawns themselves , which benefit the environment in many ways , critics say . It 's the way they encourage overuse of everything from fertilizer and pesticides to water . <p> Such practices are coming under increasing scrutiny , not only from environmentalists but also from lawn-industry companies , which are keeping a wary eye on the amorphous , but rapidly growing , organic lawn movement . <p> " Lawns probably have n't risen to the level of a major national environmental issue - yet , " says Paul Parker , executive vice president of the Center for Resource Management in Salt Lake City , a nonprofit environmental group that encourages collaboration among business leaders , government , and environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant that water , pesticide use , and loss of wildlife habitat are increasingly important . " <p> Consider : <p> * For the first time ever , lawn equipment , fertilizer , and pesticide industry representatives have joined with environmental groups and the Environmental Protection Agency to create a " Lawn and Environment Coalition . " In March , the coalition unveiled the first-ever draft guidelines for national lawn-care practices to help Americans protect the environment while they green their lawns . <p> * By most accounts , the number of lawn care companies touting a natural , organic approach is rising rapidly . At least one traditional lawn care company is developing its own line of organic products - although there 's no agreement on what " organic " means . <p> * San Antonio 's water department is working with builders to encourage the use of more drought-tolerant grasses in subdivisions . In Milford , Conn. , residents hold " freedom lawn " competitions , giving awards to the best-looking lawns that eschew the standard chemical approach . <p> * Across the border in Canada , Quebec will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year . Dozens of other Canadian municipalities have also restricted pesticide use . <p> * The National Wildlife Federation and the National Audubon Society are among several groups now campaigning to convince Americans to plant more gardens and plants and less lawn . If attendance at organic lawn-care classes is any indication , consumers are beginning to listen . <p> Two years ago , Leticia Safran told her husband she was dropping their traditional lawn-care service to go the natural route . " What made me switch was my three kids and our dog , " says the Natick , Mass. , homemaker . " On the days when the chemical company came to spray the lawn , I just did n't have a good feeling about the little sign they put on lawn - telling us to stay off for two days . " <p> Instead , she hired an organic specialist who treated her lawn with a combination of gypsum , compost , humate shale - and a combination fish-emulsion and seaweed spray . This spring her lawn received those ingredients plus a " compost tea " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be on to the next big thing . About 4 out of 5 US households have private lawns , according to a 1998 academic study . They are typically about a third of an acre , and in 2003 , Americans spent $ 38.4 billion tending those yards and gardens , about $ 457 per household , says the National Gardening Association . A growing portion of that money appears to be going organic , observers say . <p> " Hybrid mowers , water conserving sprinklers , and organic fertilizers are all potential gold mines for industry players , " wrote Don Montuori , acquisitions editor for Packaged Facts , in a market-research report last spring . " Consumers who want to tend their yard in an ecologically sound manner will pay big money for the right tools , and as the industry stands right now , the big players are missing out on all of that revenue . " <p> That may be changing . Scotts , the big fertilizer and yard-care products manufacturer , is developing a new line of organic lawn-care products . <p> But whether lawns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out that all those lush , weed-free acres sop up gargantuan quantities of water and chemicals . In a typical year , the average lawn consumes about 10,000 gallons of water over and above rainfall , the Environmental Protection Agency reports . Nearly a third of urban water use in the Eastern US goes to watering lawns , it adds . <p> In addition , millions of pounds of chemicals get dumped on lawns . In 1999 , the last year such figures were available , 78 million pounds of yard insecticides , herbicides , and fungicides were sold to US households - not including professional applications , the EPA said . If they 're overused ( and some would argue even when they 're not ) , pesticide and fertilizer runoff can pollute rivers and groundwater . <p> Then there are the millions of gallons of gasoline used in lawn equipment , whose engines are generally not as efficient as cars and can cause significant air pollution , California Air Resources Board says . <p> " The consumer , science , and the private sector have interacted in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' something that 's always green and always watered and fertilized , " says Gordon Geballe , coauthor of " Redesigning the American Lawn : A Search for Environmental Harmony . " <p> He argues that a new set of ethics and expectations is needed to put lawn care more in sync with nature . " Why put out a bird feeder to feed birds , but put pesticides on the lawn and kill worms so they have no food ? " Dr. Geballe asks . <p> Each year , the US adds about 2 million acres of residential property , a 2001 US Department of Agriculture study reports . The result is a loss of habitat for birds and other animals , says Tess Present of the National Audubon Society . " We recognize that lawns are near and dear to everybody . But we 'd like people to start thinking about whether they need as much area in lawn . " <p> Even industry officials agree that more needs to be done to educate consumers . <p> " We 're making sure we 're communicating with consumers that applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim King , spokesman for Scotts , the Marysville , Ohio , company that is the largest US yard and garden products manufacturer - and part of the new Lawn and Environment Coalition . " Applying twice as much fertilizer or insecticide is not going to get them results that are twice as good . " <p> But lawns also have environmental benefits , these groups point out . For example : Turf saves energy by staying 30 to 40 degrees cooler than bare soil and 50 or more degrees cooler than streets , helping keep homes cool , notes the Better Lawn and Turf Institute , a trade group . <p> Grass also produces oxygen , with a 50-by-50-feet patch of lawn producing enough for a family of four , the Institute says . One acre of lawn can soak up 100 pounds of sulfur dioxide each year . And a 10,000 square-foot lawn can prevent erosion by sopping up as much as 6,000 gallons of rainwater during a rainstorm . <p> The coalition between environmentalists and manufacturers of yard and garden products is an attempt to bridge sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups traditionally at odds , " says Allen James of Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment , which represents fertilizer and pesticide companies . But some environmental groups attending the conference disputed the guidelines , which are still under development . <p> Even defining " organic " remains problematic . " Not all organic care is the same , " says Nick Novick , who runs Small Planet Landscaping in Ashland , Mass . " We 're at the point in this industry that organic foods were a few years ago . We need standards and government enforcement ... " <p> That seems to be coming . The Northeast Organic Farming Association recently published the first-in-the-nation technical standards for organic yard care . <p> But the biggest change of all may be the expectations of people like Debora White of Wellesley , Mass. , who is in her third year of organic lawn care . She 's changed her outlook on what a lawn should be . <p> Despite living in an affluent community , Ms. White does n't care anymore if she sees crabgrass here and there - though her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After a transition phase , weeds have been minimal , although a willingness to put up with clover and to use a dandelion fork and pull an occasional weed is part of going natural , too , she says . " My neighbors were recently admiring my lawn , and they had no idea I had dumped the chemical company , " she says . " I just thought it was a better way to go . I do n't want to be a crusader . I 'm just doing what I can do . " <p> Grass roots <p> * The average American homeowner spends 40 hours per year mowing the lawn . <p> * Of 103.9 million households with lawns , more than half ( 58 million ) use insecticides ; 40 million use herbicides ; 14 million use fungicides . <p> * A one-acre lawn generates almost six tons of grass clippings a year , or nearly 1,000 garbage bags ' full . <p> * The EPA estimates that the amount of pollution emitted by a lawn mower operating for one hour equals the amount of pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sources : Audubon Science Office ; Environmental Protection Agency ; Toward a Low Input Lawn by C.
