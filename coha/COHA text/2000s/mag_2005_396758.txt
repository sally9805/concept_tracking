Section : alternatives staying centered Too many choices can leave you paralyzed . Here 's how to make the right decision  --  and move on it <p> My husband , Gordon , and I have been redecorating together . The good news is that we 're still married . The bad news is that if we ever see another paint sample , it 'll be too soon . We chose the color for our bedroom from a palette of about a thousand hues . Totally overwhelmed , we finally settled on Sensual Sunrise , only to find that on the walls it looked more like Lost Lunch . There were so many choices in the Land of Pigment that I forgot to honor my own preference , which was for plain old beige . <p> In the grand scheme of things , paint is no big deal . You can change it easily . But if you get swamped with choices in important areas  --  such as finding the right partner or career path  --  a poor choice or no choice can have serious repercussions .

He had a long list of qualities that were important to him in a woman , and their first chat seemed more like a job interview . Then he asked what was on her list and was surprised that she did n't have one . <p> I can sympathize with my friend . For most of my life I was not only " list-less " when it came to men , but I was also clueless . Instead of reflecting on what was really important in the person I was planning to spend a lifetime with , I relied on my " infallible intuition , " which all too often turned out to be chemistry or the pull of an old pattern . <p> The best choices are made when facts and intuition  --  head and heart  --  both weigh in on a decision . That may sound easy , but there are lots of pitfalls , the most important of which is failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was in high school and college , I went out with a lot of guys . I 'd break up with one , only to choose another who was similar . At this my mother would put her hands on her hips and sputter , " Book smart , Joanie . You 're book smart . But look here , Miss Smarty Pants , if you do n't start learning from your experiences , you 're going to have a very unhappy life . " <p> Subtlety was not one of her virtues , but my mom was pointing out something important . Without perspective about your experiences and the willingness to ask questions about how you 've gotten where you are , you stay stuck in the same place . Eventually , I had an important insight : My beloved dad was depressed , and I 'd spent my youth trying to comfort him . So depressed and troubled men felt familiar . What seemed like love was just an old groove . This is a crucial lesson . What appears to be intuition , a powerful " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar pattern dosing around you like a trap . Walk This Way <p> There are several steps you can take that will usually land you at the door to the fight decision . First , ask yourself if it 's an important choice or a casual choice . Paint is casual ; deciding to have a child as a single woman is important . Ask , In 6 months or a year , will this choice matter to me ? If it wo n't , do n't sweat over it  --  it 's casual . If it will , recognize that it 's important and treat yourself with respect . Making a critical decision in a snap is disrespectful . If you do n't care about your life , other people are n't likely to either , and the possibility of making a bad choice gets magnified . So launch any important decision-making process with self-reflection . If you 're job hunting , for example , think back on your past positions . If you left each one for the same reason , the problem is more likely a pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The real choice you face is n't finding a career  --  it 's finding yourself . <p> The next step is to make a list of what you 're really looking for . Whether you 're vetting a career , a mate , a move , or plastic surgery , take time to listen to yourself , to hear your deepest longings and most urgent fears . One way to do this is to envision the future . A career might look attractive now , but where might it lead in 5 , 10 , or 20 years ? Is there room for growth ? Is it challenging and fulfilling ? What about your dream of moving to a farm and raising horses ? Imagining your life in a rural setting , not only now but as you age , is critical to making the right choice for yourself . While none of us knows what the future might bring , you can at least stack the deck in your favor by thinking through your decision from as many angles as possible . <p> Once you 've envisioned possible futures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . That 's where heart wisdom comes in . True heart wisdom is based on perspective . Some decisions , for example , are n't just about you ; they involve and affect others . Maybe you want to take your 12-year-old out of school and move across the country . But as you envision her next critical few years , you think she might be better off where you live now . With an open mind and heart , you discuss things because her happiness is integral to your own . Based on that process , your infatuation with the big intuitive flash that said move may become less appealing . Or perhaps your heart  --  and hers  --  may say an authentic yes . <p> One last bit of advice : When your heart tells you what it really wants , do n't let someone talk you out of it . You still have to go through your own version of due diligence , but trust yourself enough to explore what it is that you really want , not what someone else wants for you . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coin . If you find yourself hoping for heads or tails , or disappointed with the side that comes up , you have a secret preference . You still need to think things through , but at least you have a starting point . When you 're trying to make a garden-variety decision , like what kind of refrigerator to buy , do n't waste precious time looking around . Having too many choices is frustrating . Let experts like Consumer Reports do the legwork for you . If you ca n't tell whether your excitement is intuition or an old pattern , ask some friends to help you sort it out .
