A Rockefeller-family barn complex is reborn as an educational center that celebrates the connection between flavorful food and its agrarian roots . // BIG THINGS are going on at a small farm . And they 're happening just a stone 's throw from New York City at Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture , in Pocantico Hills ( twenty miles up the Hudson River from Manhattan ) . Since the eighty-acre notfor-profit opened last May , thirty-four Berkshire pigs have been clearing a wooded hillside , munching on acorns and beechnuts and whatever edible else their snouts chance upon . A busy flock of Rhode Island Red hens has roamed a grassy field and laid 2,500 dozen eggs . Twelve varieties of lettuce , fifteen types of tomatoes and ten of garlic , along with countless pounds of peas , eggplants , broccoli , squash and artichokes , have been picked from a sundrenched pasture and a remarkable half-acre , four-season greenhouse . Through special programs , local schoolchildren and young families have happily helped harvest potatoes and garlic , learned how to make ice cream or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled down for a few hours in the former hay barn or the sparkling new kitchen for lectures , cooking classes and panel discussions featuring farmers , environmentalists , food historians , cookbook authors and famous chefs , while others have enjoyed lunch on the run ( a hot pressed-duck-confit panini or a cool bowl of cucumber soup served at a casual caf ) before setting off to hike in an adjacent 1,100-acre state preserve . Neighbors have good-naturedly competed for carrots and kohlrabi at the weekly farm stand , while epicureans from near and far have valiantly fought for a reservation at the centerpiece restaurant , where a talented young chef has been performing eye-opening alchemy on the farm 's seasonal raw materials . That 's an astonishing menu of activities until you realize that the family behind this " family farm " is named Rockefeller and that its patriarch , eighty-nine-year-old David Rockefeller , has already invested some $30 million in the project , which honors his late wife , Peggy , who was , according to a plaque at the complex 's entrance , " deeply committed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she considered the foundation of our heritage and the hope for our future . " How best to convince the general public that local farmers need our protection and support ( and show that a small farm can in turn support itself ) ? By creating a multifaceted educational center that lures in potential converts with the promise of an incomparable meal and a peek into the rarefied Rockefeller world . The picturesque Norman-style barns were built a mile down the road from Kykuit , the family 's Westchester County estate , by John D. Rockefeller Jr . in 1930 to house a modest dairy operation that provided his children with fresh milk . " The barns had been sitting there largely unused since Father died in 1960 , " explains David , who began to think about constructive uses for the property after his wife 's death , in 1996 . Peggy Rockefeller was a founder of the American Farmland Trust , whose goal is to protect the small local family farm against development pressures and competition from huge , industrialized farm conglomerates . Stone Barns builds on this mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand how far most of your food has traveled before reaching the supermarket , how many nutrients it has lost on the journey ( assuming the forcefed livestock or chemically treated produce was healthful to begin with ) and just how bad it tastes compared to what 's grown locally ( and organically ) , you 'll likely start shopping at a nearby farmers ' market , planting a vegetable patch of your own or pressuring your elected officials to legislate on behalf of ecologically sound community-based agriculture . The man whom Rockefeller selected to help change your politics through your palate is Dan Barber , the thirty-five-year-old chef at Blue Hill , the acclaimed restaurant in New York City and now in its impressive new outpost at Stone Barns . Barber , who owns both restaurants with his brother and sister-in-law , David and Laureen Barber , calls Stone Barns " an experiment in raising people 's consciousness about who 's growing our food and how it gets to us . " That consciousness-raising may he subtle ( enjoying Dan Barber 's zingy tomato terrine with tomato water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines that produced the fruit ) or not so ( watching a screening of The Meatrix , a short film about America 's horrific factoryfarming industry ) . Dan Barber is also Stone Barns Center 's creative director , which is why you 're likely to see him , dressed in his starched chef 's whites , riding around the grounds on a tractor , engaged in lively conversation with Daphne Derven , the program and development director ; Craig Haney , the livestock manager ; Jack Algierc , the four-season grower ; or James Ford , the center 's executive director and Rockefeller 's righthand man on the project . If this $30 million " experiment " is to be a successful economic model , then all aspects of Stone Barns must be free from Rockefeller subsidies within three years . " There 's a romance to this place , " Barber concedes , " but in the end everybody has to make money . That 's why we need community support . Otherwise , we 're just another theme park .
