Milton Bradley 's past skulks alongside him ; his reputation enshrouds him . His is a well-worn archetype : hotheaded , temperamental , sullen , with a history of misbehavior . Sometimes withdrawn , sometimes effusive , Bradley is a complicated mix , difficult to decipher . // And the Dodgers are delighted to have him . " He 's a 26-year-old switch-hitting centerfielder with high on-base , high slugging , accomplished enough to hit in the middle of our order right now , and that 's a rare player , " says first-year Los Angeles G.M. Paul DePodesta , who points out that Bradley wo n't become a free agent until after the ' 07 season . " He has a chance to be our cornerstone offensive player over that time . " // Bradley , raised in Long Beach , has been rejuvenated by his trade from the Indians to his hometown team on the eve of Opening Day . Starting in centerfield and batting third , he 's at the heart of LA 's upgraded offense , which is averaging 4.6 runs , up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage , .515 slugging percentage , four home runs and a team-leading 18 RBIs through Sunday , he had helped boost the Dodgers ( 12-6 ) to a 2 ? - game lead in the NL West . // But even as Bradley insists that he is moving forward , he ca n't resist parting shots at his former team and manager Eric Wedge . " It was like a sinking ship , " says Bradley of Cleveland , " and I was glad to get my life raft and get my second chance over here . The right people are n't in charge there , and I 'm not the only person on that team who feels this way . There are a lot of unhappy people over there , just working for a paycheck. " // Bradley reserves his harshest words for Wedge . " My experience playing for the fans in Cleveland was awesome , and I took pride in and enjoyed being an Indian , " he says . " It was strictly a problem with Eric Wedge . Some people want to be bigger than they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anything , how are you going to tell someone else what he needs to be doing ? I ca n't respect somebody that has nothing to go on . " // The final straw in Bradley 's turbulent 2 ? - year stint in Cleveland  --  which included several spats with Wedge  --  came on March 31 during spring training , when Wedge thought that Bradley did not run out a second-inning pop-up quickly enough . When Bradley returned to the dugout , he told Wedge he had felt a twinge in his groin and did n't want to exert himself in a meaningless game . After an angry exchange , Wedge pulled him . " Milton crossed the line that day for the final time , " says Wedge . Bradley immediately left the stadium , and four days later the Dodgers outbid a half dozen other clubs by offering outfield prospect Franklin Gutierrez and a player to be named . // Wedge maintains it was not an isolated incident : " I think it 's safe to say that what was out publicly , versus what also happened behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a second-round draft choice of the Expos in ' 96 , but he quickly found trouble . In 1998 he poked an umpire in the mask during a fall league game , and he spit on another in Double A the following season . In 2000 he sparred with manager Jeff Cox at Triple A Ottawa and Jeff Torborg with the Expos in ' 01 . " What happened five years ago is n't relevant to today , " Bradley says . " Let the past be the past . " // Yet contradiction bubbles inside him . Last week he said , " An umpire calls bad pitches on you , so what ? Hit the good ones . " But in the first inning of Saturday 's 5-3 loss to San Francisco , Bradley was tossed for arguing a called third strike . // To the offensively puny Dodgers , Bradley represents not a problem or a puzzle but a bat . DePodesta says Bradley 's numbers ( a .421 on-base percentage , .501 slugging and 10 homers in ' 03 , all career highs ) made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beane joked to DePodesta that when , inevitably , reporters asked whether he was concerned about Bradley 's attitude , he ought to respond , " I 'm more concerned about our offense. " // Bradley 's new teammates have n't judged him on his past . " I 've played with tons of guys who had bad reputations and turned out to be great teammates once they got in the right environment , " says Shawn Green , who relocated from the outfield to first base to accommodate Bradley . " He 's been respectful and humble . He 's become one of the guys . " // Manager Jim Tracy 's style differs from Wedge 's ; he prefers to handle disciplinary issues one-on-one and will not call out a player in front of his club or in print . " I do n't look to have a lot of conversations with him in the heat of battle , " Tracy says . // Bradley is thrilled to be closer to his Long Beach home and to his mother , Charlena Rector , who was diagnosed last November with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a course of chemotherapy . Rector says her son is a mama 's boy who still keeps a bedroom at home and a closet filled with clothes and shoes . As a kid Bradley was a Dodgers fan , and he reveres the team 's tradition . " Being a Dodger is like having a bubble around you . Everything else just bounces off , " he says . // As Bradley talked last week , Tommy Lasorda , the avuncular former manager who is now the club 's senior vice president , caught his eye from across the room , ambled over and interrupted , shaking his hand vigorously . " Milton Bradley , " he boomed , " keep that smile on your face ! You 're a Dodger now , and do n't you forget it ! " Without uttering a word , Bradley received the benediction , nodded and smiled .
