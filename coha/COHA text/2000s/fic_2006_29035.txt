I Say a Little Prayer By E. Lynn Harris Random House E. Lynn Harris Prologue There are times when I think that I , Chauncey Dion Greer , am passing through this life on my way to the life God really planned for me . Then , at other times , I think that God must have a wicked sense of humor . Who knew ? How else could you explain me sitting here in the green room at CNN on Election Eve , sweating like a fat man in a sauna wearing a warm-up suit , and staring at a tray of sliced melons ? I do n't know if I 'm about to do something noble or if I 'm about to get P-I-M-P-E-D . It 's not like my life has been without its good moments . Whenever I 'm stressed out , I think back to the days when I went fishing with my daddy , and I begin to smile inside . We 'd stop at Reverend Nick 's Bait and Tackle with our fishing gear , purchase our supplies , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw-berry jam sandwiches that my mother would make for our lunch . All the way to Blue Lake , we 'd brag about the fish we were going to catch . I also remember when I won my first songwriting contest when I was sixteen . And , of course , I 'll never forget when I met him . Still , something happens to your soul when the expiration date on your love life comes and goes before you turn twenty-five . Was I getting ready to share that love life with the world because I thought it mattered , or because Iwanted to finally get revenge ? Was I trying to do the right thing , or just wanting to settle the score with the person I had once loved the most but I now despised ? I stood up , glanced at the mirror on the wall , and straightened my tie . I stared at my reflection , checking to see if the makeup artist had n't applied too much powder to my mink-colored skin and if it would really prevent me from shining once the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small paper plate and headed for some melon , a high , annoying voice whispered into my ear . " Mr. Greer , we have a small problem . " I turned and faced the tall , thin , pale woman with freckles dominating her oval face . Her strawberry-blond hair was pulled back in a cheerleader 's ponytail . " Excuse me , " I said . " I 'm Lauren Masterson , the executive producer of Larry King Live . Thank you for coming , " she said as she extended her ringless hand . " What happened to Mr. Gains ? " I asked . " He 's coming down in a few , but I need to explain something . " She motioned toward the red leather couch , and we sat down . Lowering her voice so the other guests in the green room could n't hear her , she continued . " I think you spoke with one of our associate producers , Dana Wynn , and she agreed to interview you with your face in shadow and your voice disguised , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Gains promised me that we 'd do it that way . That 's the only reason I agreed to do the interview . " " Yes , Mr. Greer , and I know this is a very private matter for you , but I just do n't think the interview will have the punch we need if you 're not willing to reveal your identity . These are very serious charges that you are alleging against a man who could be elected U.S. senator within the next twenty-four hours and tip the scales as to who controls the Senate . The repercussions could be far-reaching . " " I understand that , but I only agreed to do the interview one way , " I said firmly . She shook her head , unwavering . " I 'm sorry about what you were promised , but we simply ca n't do it that way . " She paused . " Mr. Greer , this is live television , and I need to know if you 're going to go on and tell your story just as you are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sat face-to-face in total silence . I pondered my choices . Either decision would change my life as I knew it . What should I do ? What would I do ?
