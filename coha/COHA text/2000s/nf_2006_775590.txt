OCTOBER 1 . Is it winter again , is it cold again , did n't Frank just slip on the ice , did n't he heal , were n't the spring seeds planted did n't the night end , did n't the melting ice flood the narrow gutters was n't my body rescued , was n't it safe did n't the scar form , invisible above the injury terror and cold , did n't they just end , was n't the back garden harrowed and planted- I remember how the earth felt , red and dense , in stiff rows , were n't the seeds planted , did n't vines climb the south wall I ca n't hear your voice for the wind 's cries , whistling over the bare ground // I no longer care what sound it makes when was I silenced , when did it first seem pointless to describe that sound what it sounds like ca n't change what it is- did n't the night end , was n't the earth safe when it was planted did n't we plant the seeds , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they harvested ? // 2 . Summer after summer has ended , balm after violence : it does me no good to be good to me now ; violence has changed me . Daybreak . The low hills shine ochre and fire , even the fields shine . I know what I see ; sun that could be the August sun , returning everything that was taken away- You hear this voice ? This is my mind 's voice ; you ca n't touch my body now . It has changed once , it has hardened , do n't ask it to respond again . // A day like a day in summer . Exceptionally still . The long shadows of the maples nearly mauve on the gravel paths . And in the evening , warmth . Night like a night in summer . It does me no good ; violence has changed me . My body has grown cold like the stripped fields ; now there is only my mind , cautious and wary , with the sense it is being tested . Once more , the sun rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence . Balm after the leaves have changed , after the fields have been harvested and turned . Tell me this is the future , I wo n't believe you . Tell me I 'm living , I wo n't believe you . // 3. // Snow had fallen . I remember music from an open window . Come to me , said the world . This is not to say it spoke in exact sentences but that I perceived beauty in this manner . Sunrise . A film of moisture on each living thing . Pools of cold light formed in the gutters . I stood at the doorway , ridiculous as it now seems . What others found in art , I found in nature . What others found in human love , I found in nature . Very simple . But there was no voice there . Winter was over . In the thawed dirt , bits of green were showing . Come to me , said the world . I was standing in my wool coat at a kind of bright portal- I can finally say long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healer , the teacher- death can not harm me more than you have harmed me , my beloved life . // 4 . The light has changed ; middle C is tuned darker now . And the songs of morning sound over-rehearsed . This is the light of autumn , not the light of spring . The light of autumn : you will not be spared . // The songs have changed ; the unspeakable has entered them . This is the light of autumn , not the light that says I am reborn . Not the spring dawn : I strained , I suffered , I was delivered . This is the present , an allegory of waste . So much has changed . And still , you are fortunate : the ideal burns in you like a fever . Or not like a fever , like a second heart . The songs have changed , but really they are still quite beautiful . They have been concentrated in a smaller space , the space of the mind . They are dark , now , with desolation and anguish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipation of silence . The ear gets used to them . The eye gets used to disappearances . You will not be spared , nor will what you lope be spared . A wind has come and gone , taking apart the mind ; it has left in its wake a strange lucidity . How privileged you are , to be still passionately clinging to what you love ; the forfeit of hope has not destroyed you . Maestoso , doloroso : This is the light of autumn ; it has turned on us . Surely it is a privilege to approach the end still believing in something . // 5 . It is true there is not enough beauty in the world . It is also true that I am not competent to restore it . Neither is there candor , and here I may be of some use . // I am at work , though I am silent . The bland misery of the world bounds us on either side , an alley lined with trees ; we are companions here , not speaking , each with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private houses , the shuttered rooms somehow deserted , abandoned , as though it were the artist 's duty to create hope , but out of what ? what ? the word itself false , a device to refute perception-At the intersection , ornamental lights of the season . I was young here . Riding the subway with my small book as though to defend myself against this same world : you are not alone , the poem said , in the dark tunnel . // 6 . The brightness of the day becomes the brightness of the night ; the fire becomes the mirror . My friend the earth is bitter ; I think sunlight has failed her . Bitter or weary , it is hard to say . Between herself and the sun , something has ended . She wants , now , to be left alone ; I think we must give up turning to her for affirmation . Above the fields , above the roofs of the village houses , the brilliance that made all life possible becomes the cold stars . Lie still and watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth 's bitter disgrace , coldness and barrenness my friend the moon rises : she is beautiful tonight , but when is she not beautiful ? // PERSEPHONE THE WANDERER In the first version , Persephone is taken from her mother and the goddess of the earth punishes the earth-this is consistent with what we know of human behavior , that human beings take profound satisfaction in doing harm , particularly unconcious harm : we may call this negative creation . Persephone 's initial sojourn in hell continues to be pawed over by scholars who dispute the sensations of the virgin : did she cooperate in her rape , or was she drugged , violated against her will , as happens so often now to modern girls . As is well known , the return of the beloved does not correct the loss of the beloved : Persephone returns home stained with red juice like a character in Hawthorne- I am not certain I will keep this word : is earth " home " to Persephone ? Is she at home , conceivably , in the bed of the god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born wanderer , in other words an existential replica of her own mother , less hamstrung by ideas of causality ? You are allowed to like no one , you know . The characters are not people . They are aspects of a dilemma or conflict . Three parts : just as the soul is divided , ego , superego , id . Likewise the three levee of the known world , a kind of diagram that separates heaven from earth from hell . You must ask yourself : where is it snowing ? White of forgetfulness , of desecration- It is snowing on earth ; the cold wind says Persephone is having sex in hell . Unlike the rest of us , she does n't know what winter is , only that she is what causes it . She is lying in the bed of Hades . What is in her mind ? Is she afraid ? Has something blotted out the idea of mind ? She does know the earth is run by mothers , this much is certain . She also knows she is not what is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has been a prisoner since she has been a daughter . The terrible reunions in store for her will take up the rest of her life . When the passion for expiation is chronic , fierce , you do not choose the way you live . You do not live ; you are not allowed to die . You drift between earth and death which seem , finally , strangely alike . Scholars tell us that there is no point in knowing what you want when the forces contending over you could kill you . White of forgetfulness , white of safety- They say there is a rift in the human soul which was not constructed to belong entirely to life . Earth asks us to deny this rift , a threat disguised as suggestion- as we have seen in the tale of Persephone which should be read as an argument between the mother and the lover- the daughter is just meat . When death confronts her , she has never seen the meadow without the daisies . Suddenly she is no longer singing her maidenly songs about her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the break is . Song of the earth , song of the mythic vision of eternal life- My soul shattered with the strain of trying to belong to earth- What will you do , when it is your turn in the field with the god ? // PRISM 1 . Who can say what the world is ? The world is in flux , therefore unreadable , the winds shifting , the great plates invisibly shifting and changing- // 2 . Dirt . Fragments of blistered rock . On which the exposed heart constructs a house , memory : the gardens manageable , small in scale , the beds damp at the sea 's edge- 3 . As one takes in an enemy , through these windows one takes in the world : here is the kitchen , here the darkened study . // Meaning : I am master here . // 4 . When you fall in love , my sister said , it 's like being struck by lightning . She was speaking hopefully , to draw the attention of the lightning . I reminded her that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had discussed in childhood , because we both felt that what we were looking at in the adults were the effects not of lightning but of the electric chair . 5 . Riddle : Why was my mother happy ? Answer : She married my father . 6 . " You girls , " my mother said , " should marry someone like your father . " That was one remark . Another was , " There is no one like your father . " // 7 . From the pierced clouds , steady lines of silver . Unlikely yellow of the witch hazel , veins of mercury that were the paths of the rivers- Then the rain again , erasing footprints in the damp earth . An implied path , like a map without a crossroads . 8 . The implication was , it was necessary to abandon childhood . The word " marry " was a signal . You could also treat it as aesthetic advice ; the voice of the child was tiresome , it had no lower register . The word was a code , mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadsign , a warning . You could take a few things with you like a dowry . You could take the part of you that thought . " Marry " meant you should keep that part quiet . 9 . A night in summer . Outside , sounds of a summer storm . Then the sky clearing . In the window , constellations of summer . I 'm in a bed . This man and I , we are suspended in the strange calm sex often induces . Most sex induces . Longing , what is that ? Desire , what is that ? In the window , constellations of summer . Once , I could name them . 10 . Abstracted shapes , patterns . The light of the mind . The cold , exacting fires of disinterestedness , curiously blocked by earth , coherent , glittering in air and water , the elaborate signs that said now plant , now , harvest - I could name them , I had names for them : two different things . // 11 . Fabulous things , stars . When I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my parents permitted me to sit by the lake ; I took the dog for company . Did I say " suffered " ? That was my parents ' way of explaining tastes that seemed to them inexplicable : better " suffered " than " preferred to live with the dog . " Darkness . Silence that annulled mortality . The tethered boats rising and falling . When the moon was full , I could sometimes read the girls ' names painted to the sides of the boats : Ruth Ann , Sweet Izzy , Peggy My Darling - They were going nowhere , those girls . There was nothing to be learned from them . I spread my jacket in the damp sand , the dog curled up beside me . My parents could n't see the lift : in my head ; when I wrote it down , they fixed the spelling . Sounds of the lake . The soothing , inhuman sounds of water lapping the dock , the dog scuffling somewhere in the weeds- // 12 . The assignment was to fall in love . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include in the poem certain words , words drawn from a specific text on another subject altogether . // 13 . Spring rain , then a night in summer . A man 's voice , then a woman 's voice . You grew up , you were struck by lightning . When you opened your eyes , you were wired forever to your true love . It only happened once . Then you were taken care of , your story was finished . It happened once . Being struck was like being vaccinated ; the rest of your life you were immune , you were warm and dry . Unless the shock was n't deep enough . Then you were n't vaccinated , you were addicted . // 14 . The assignment was to fall in love . The author was female . The ego had to be called the soul . The action took place in the body . Stars represented everything else : dreams , the mind , etc . The beloved was identified with the self in a narcissistic projection . The mind was a subplot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative than ritual . What was repeated had weight . Certain endings were tragic , thus acceptable . Everything else was failure . 15 . Deceit . Lies . Embellishments we call hypotheses- There were too many roads , too many versions . There were too many roads , no one path- And at the end ? 16 . List the implications of " crossroads . " Answer : a story that will have a moral . Give a counter-example : 17 . The self ended and the world began . They were of equal size , commensurate , one mirrored the other . // 18 . The riddle was : why could n't we live in the mind . The answer was : the barrier of the earth intervened . // 19 . The room was quiet . That is , the room was quiet , but the lovers were breathing . In the same way , the night was dark . It was dark , but the stars shone . The man in bed was one of several men to whom I gave my heart . The gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it recurs . The room was quiet . It was an absolute , like the black night . 20 . A night in summer . Sounds of a summer storm . The great plates invisibly shifting and changing- And in the dark room , the lovers sleeping in each other 's arms . We are , each of us , the one who wakens first , who stirs first and sees , there in the first dawn , the stranger . // CRATER LAKE There was a war between good and evil . We decided to call the body good . That made death evil . It turned the soul against death completely . Like a foot soldier wanting to serve a great warrior , the soul wanted to side with the body . It turned against the dark , against the forms of death it recognized . Where does the voice come from that says suppose the war is evil , that says suppose the body did this to us , made us afraid of love- //            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
