<p> So which is it going to be , Jeff Samardzija ? Pro baseball or pro football ? What 's that you said ? Both ? Kids today . They just ca n't make up their minds . <p> For Samardzija , the Notre Dame pitcher/wide receiver , the best decision apparently is a non-decision . At least until further notice . <p> After ... playing both professionally , then I 'll have a better idea whether I can do both  --  and if I ca n't , then which way I 'll want to go , " Samardzija said after being taken by the Cubs in the fifth round of the amateur draft Tuesday . <p> He will spend about six weeks this summer playing in the Cubs ' minor-league system  --  likely at their Class A affiliate in Boise , Idaho  --  before returning to South Bend for football season . If all goes as expected back on campus , the Irish will contend for the national title and Samardzija , who is ranked as the top college receiving prospect by ESPN 's Mel Kiper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then , Holy Bo and Deion , Samardzija will play for the Cubs ' organization next summer and play in the NFL next fall . <p> Whether Samardzija can be successful at the pro level in both sports remains to be seen . As a high NFL pick , he would be expected to play and contribute his rookie season . But what about baseball ? For every Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders , who found success in both sports , there are many who failed . Guys such as Ricky Williams ( four minor-league seasons , topped out at Class A , hit .211 ) and Drew Henson ( nine major-league at-bats ) , for instance , found out that trying to crack a major-league roster is about as tough as it gets . <p> Carolina Panthers quarterback Chris Weinke knows just how difficult it is to go from top prospect to big-leaguer . At 18 , Weinke , a third baseman , faced a tough decision after being drafted in the second round by the Toronto Blue Jays . Pro baseball or college football ? Weinke chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jays ' farm system . He reached Class AAA before calling it quits after the 1996 season and enrolling at Florida State , where he won the 2000 Heisman Trophy as a 28-year-old senior . <p> I never would have considered playing both sports professionally , " Weinke said . Even prior to doing it , I would think baseball is hard enough in itself . ... You do n't see anyone these days being successful at both . " <p> It has been 20 years since Jackson made his major-league debut and 15 years since a hip injury forced him to retire from the NFL . Sanders last played baseball in 2001 . <p> Looking back , I do n't think there was as big of a premium on making the sports year-round back when Jackson and Sanders played , " Weinke said . You played football in the fall and baseball for a few months in the summer . Nowadays , you 'd be missing out on football camp if you were playing baseball . I 'm in the middle of a three-week camp right now . Professional sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football , you have to make it a year-round job . It 's hard to do both . " <p> Samardzija figures that playing both sports in college has given him an idea of what to expect . <p> My last break was July three years ago , " he said . It 's not going to make a difference to me ; it 's what I do . That I will graduate from school and have that out of my way is a big release from the weekly schedule . After graduation , instead of it being football , baseball and school , it 's going to be football and baseball but a little bit more of both . " <p> Former major-league outfielder Phil Bradley played quarterback for the Missouri football team and center field for its baseball team . His decision about which sport to pursue professionally was made easier when he learned NFL scouts wanted to convert him to another position , likely defensive back . <p> I probably had a better college career in football than in baseball , " said Bradley , who played for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majors . But the NFL was not interested in me playing quarterback , and that was the only position I knew how to play . " <p> Bradley , who works for the Major League Baseball Players Association , said he never considered playing both sports professionally . <p> It 's hard enough to do one , " he said . It was hard enough in college . You had to break the year into six-month increments and be ready to compete in one sport , then the other . In the NFL , the only way to do it is with those types of athletes that are defensive backs Sanders or running backs Jackson . It would be hard to do it being a receiver or a quarterback , people who have to work with others . " <p> Bradley 's son Curt , who plays baseball ( infield ) and football ( receiver ) at Northern Iowa , was drafted last week by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 33rd round . Should he sign with the Dodgers , go back to school for his last season of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If I was Samardzija 's dad , I 'd keep football in the hopper as long as he can , " Bradley said . There 's no reason to make that final decision until you absolutely have to . Samardzija is a talented kid . The best thing he can do is get his feet wet in baseball . Play this summer , then see what happens in the NFL draft and make a decision . If he 's going to be a starting pitcher , going only once every five days , it might be easier to play both sports . " <p> Notre Dame baseball coach Paul Mainieri said he has no doubt Samardzija can be a major-leaguer . <p> This guy is going to be a great major-league pitcher , if that 's the route he chooses , " Mainieri said Tuesday . He has all of the ability that it takes . He 's got the body , he 's got the arm strength . Every time he pitched , he got better and better . " <p> If forced to make a choice today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Anyone who thinks I 'm not serious about baseball , just come out and watch me play , " he said . With the situation I have in football , if I did n't love baseball , I would have stopped playing a long time ago . It 's not really a question of whether I 'm going to play . I love baseball and am going to be playing as long as I can . " <p> Because of its guaranteed contracts , baseball offers more financial security than football . <p> Of course , a special talent such as Samardzija typically can look forward to a multimillion-dollar NFL signing bonus  --  assuming his draft stock does n't drop because of his dual-career objective . The NFL team that drafts Samardzija will have to be OK with him skipping voluntary " offseason workouts . And training camp . Either that , or Samardzija would have to miss a substantial part of the regular season in baseball . That would become a problem if he makes it to the majors . <p> Logistical problems await . But as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make special allowances for special players . And Samardzija seems to be a special one . Who can fault the kid for pursuing his dreams ? <p> I went through it at 18 and did n't know what to expect , " Weinke said . But I always say that to make a decision , you should go with what your heart says to do .
