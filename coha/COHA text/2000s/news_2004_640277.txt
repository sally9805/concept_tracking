<p> Ten and 12-hour days . Work on the weekends . No vacations . <p> Boy , this guy is feeling the pressures of pregnancy . <p> ' It 's been one of the more stressful things I 've ever been through , ' said Steve Sander , partner in Denver 's GBSM marketing and consulting firm . ' It has been very , very tough . ' <p> Sander 's not a dad . <p> He 's not even married . <p> But he is the boss in a small firm where four women got pregnant , one after the other . Since November , at least one has been on maternity leave at all times . <p> Sander , 50 , is thrilled for the new moms but said he 's weary after months of extra work . <p> ' You think , why are you personally having to make the sacrifices so that other people can enjoy this part of their life ? ' Sander said . ' You ca n't help but be resentful about the situation . ' <p> His office drama opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workplace issue . <p> Most dialogue around working moms has centered on child care and work schedules and whether ' doing it all ' is more freedom or burden . <p> Less discussed is the strain on expectant moms who are working and the strain on their bosses and co-workers . <p> Several factors are at play : More women are working than ever before . Many are having children at a later age , when they 're further along in their career , making it more difficult for employers to cope . <p> At the same time , businesses are running lean on staff , making it hard to cover for someone who 's out 12 weeks . That is the standard , unpaid maternity leave required of employers with 50 or more employees under the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act . <p> This mix of factors can cause hurt feelings , stress , productivity loss and sometimes lawsuits . <p> Fifty-five percent of women who had a baby in 2000 worked through pregnancy , according to census figures . That compares with 38 percent in 1980 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grab bag of symptoms - excitement , fatigue , nausea , anxiety , spaciness , aching backs , swelling feet and , in some cases , painful complications . <p> Meanwhile , co-workers had to cover for them during maternity leave and sometimes before . <p> Tracy Boyle , a senior account manager at GBSM , was tired through much of her pregnancy but said she worked as hard , if not harder , than before . <p> She had her daughter , Talia , in February and returned to work full-time this month . <p> ' I would overcompensate and try to always be in a good mood and volunteer to do stuff and stay late so I could prove I was just as productive , ' said Boyle , 33 . <p> Boyle said it was she - not Sander , her boss - who was cracking the whip . <p> ' It 's my nature to say ' I can do everything , ' ' she said . <p> And while she was gone ? <p> Sander took on some of her responsibilities and hired a contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus the transition time before and after . <p> That , Sander said , brought up a whole new set of challenges . <p> Both sides feel squeeze <p> Losing an employee for 12 weeks for any reason can hurt productivity , particularly when employees already are carrying a heavy workload , said work trends expert John Challenger , president of Chicago-based Challenger Gray &; Christmas . <p> Employers are squeezing more work out of fewer people than they were 20 years ago , he said . The economic downturn stretched them further . <p> ' Companies do n't have as much bench strength as they used to , ' he said . <p> However , Challenger noted that today 's companies can readily hire consultants or temps , or ask employees to work from home . <p> The larger problem for employers and pregnant employees is that there is little flexibility , said Ellen Mozurkewich , an OB-GYN and professor at the University of Michigan . <p> ' There is not a societal decision to pay for ( pregnant women ) to work less than full-time or be less productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't provide paid maternity leave , an increasing number of women return to work well before 12 weeks is up . If they have complications that require more time off , women lose their rights to retain their jobs . <p> In the end , both employers and employees can suffer , Mozurkewich said . <p> In 2003 , 23 percent of employers provided some paid maternity leave , according to a Society of Human Resource Management survey . Family-friendly benefits , including flexible scheduling , improved from 1999 to 2002 , then fell in 2003 , the group reports . <p> On the flip side , claims of pregnancy discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission rose from 3,577 in 1993 to 4,649 in 2003 . <p> Most pregnancy-related legal disputes are alleged violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act or Pregnancy Discrimination Act - an amendment to the Civil Rights Act that forbids discrimination in hiring . <p> ' Given the current economy , employers are a little more aggressive with employees , I think , and not so concerned about retaining them , ' said Lynn Feiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Denver . <p> ' Oftentimes , ( pregnant women ) go from the fast track to the slow track and it 's not your choice , ' she said . ' You might be targeted for a promotion and all of a sudden the promotion evaporates , or someone else gets the promotion even though you 're most qualified . I see that a lot . ' <p> Besides sensational stories - such as a 2000 discrimination case won by two Hooters waitresses in Louisiana who were fired after getting pregnant - the public hears little about pregnancy discrimination cases . <p> Many cases settle , with terms requiring the woman to keep quiet about her case , Feiger said . <p> Some women who may have a case do n't pursue it , she said . They lack the energy or fear retaliation . Or they do n't want to ruin chances of negotiating a flexible work schedule after the baby is born . <p> Most often , Feiger sees women who ca n't afford 12 weeks of unpaid leave ask to work from home - and the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer than 50 employees , GBSM is n't required by law to offer family leave , but the firm still grants parents 12 weeks off , partially paid . <p> Parents can also negotiate flexible schedules . For instance , Tracy Boyle , who returned full-time this month after the birth of her child , works from home on Wednesdays . <p> Those benefits , however , come with aches and pains . <p> The fast-moving advertising business , based on client relationships , is n't a job for most temps . <p> Fortunately , Sander found a qualified person on contract , Hilary Miller . She started a month before Boyle left to get up to speed with clients . <p> But when Boyle returned , Sander was in for a surprise . <p> ' Now I have number of clients who really like the contract person , ' he said of Miller . <p> Fortunately for everyone , Miller was hired permanently in another department . <p> And how has Sander juggled all the pregnancies ? <p> ' I think he 's handled it as well as anybody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares about us as people first , I think , and wants us to be well and happy , first and foremost . ' <p> Sander said his frustrations lie with the situation , not his employees . <p> ' The economic models people are under today - in terms of the pressures of how hard people are working - have stretched the ( workplace ) environment to such a degree there is very little margin for error , ' Sander said . ' There is n't any cushion . ' <p> With more staff to draw from , larger companies like Douglas County-based CH2M Hill can better manage employee absences . The global engineering firm has 10,000 employees . <p> Allowing moms-to-be and parents to work at home or work part-time makes good business sense , said Michele Wagner , human resources consultant for CH2M Hill . <p> The company 's flexible policies are aimed at retaining employees , said Wagner , herself a mom who works part-time . <p> ' Replacement costs can be anywhere from 50 percent to 100 percent of an employee 's salary , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy - at least four of 47 employees were pregnant at any given time from 1999 to 2003 - the company was able to avert crisis . <p> The staff shifted priorities to get the most important projects done first . A few employees from the firm 's Milwaukee office filled in temporarily . <p> At other times when someone is absent , Wagner said , CH2M Hill hires temps for clerical work . That saves the company money , and existing employees take on more responsibilities . <p> ' It gives people the opportunity to cross train and learn other people 's jobs , ' Wagner said . <p> Staff writer Kelly Pate Dwyer can be reached at 303-820-1209 or kdwyer@denverpost.com.
