Magnitude 3.0 <br> <br> " ARE you disturbed ? " <br> Standing there in his full-length lab coat , those rosy pockmarked cheeks , the droopy hound dog jowls , the crooked yellow bottom teeth , and that flawless white crew cut , Gregory Day seems to want a response . But I know better . <br> I do n't appreciate the way he talks to me . If he talks to me . Direct questions receive monosyllabic responses . To Gregory , everything I do , say , or ask is unhelpful , asinine , and rhetorical . I clench my teeth and count out thirty pills in therapeutic fashion , sliding the lot into a burnt orange plastic bottle . <br> " Yeah Gregory , I 'm disturbed , " I burst out , my voice shaking . <br> " I 'm an idiot because I told Mrs. Olivia to take her pills on an empty stomach . I 'm an idiot even though she asked me , and I told her exactly what it says on the tiny green label . The label I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardly stuffs it in his mouth , and gives it three quick toots . This is how he exercises . The seventyfour-year-old quit smoking ten years ago , but it was too late . Emphysema had already set in . There 's no erasing a half century 's worth of nicotine plus some exposure to nasty chemicals in the war . <br> " No , you 're an idiot because I 've repeatedly told you not to dispense medical advice to our customers , Andrew , " he says catching his breath . <br> For nine months now , Gregory has refused to call me " Andy . " <br> After a long pause , he adds , " And for the record , you did n't just tell her to ' take the pills on an empty stomach . ' You went into some long , complicated , totally off-base explanation about how food interferes with the drug 's absorption into the bloodstream . For the umpteenth time : you are not a pharmacist . " <br> I know . <br> " You 're a pharmacy technician . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to break the law and get my license yanked because you have a hankering need to feel validated , " he says . <br> Oh , please . <br> In terms of all-out destruction , this argument rates low  --  a magnitude 3.0 , tops  --  mere aftershocks from the 5.0 we had two hours ago over the effectiveness of zinc lozenges . I say they preempt the onset of the common cold . Gregory 's professional opinion is they 're " baloney . " <br> As the crow flies , this tiny pharmacy is about twenty miles northeast of San Francisco and sits on solid bedrock , but the tiny township of Crockett is bordered on every side by precarious fault lines , the most threatening  --  the Hayward Fault Zone to our west . Of the ten thousand earthquakes that California experiences every year  --  in the last hundred years  --  only two have been catastrophic . In fact , most folks ca n't even sense anything lower than a 3.0 . But not me . I feel them all the time . Right here . For Gregory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything above a 5.0 <br> generates intense feelings of nausea and vertigo . <br> Belinda is behind the front cash register too engrossed in People magazine and too consumed with the taste of her fingernails to give a damn about a measly 3.0 . Gregory and I bicker all the time , and a mag 3.0 does n't even break her concentration anymore . Some ripples in her no-foam soy latte . It 's going to take at least a 6.0 before anything interrupts " Britney Time . " <br> " Is this a 3 or 5 ? " Gregory asks with my back to him . <br> I spin around and realize that he 's not referring to our argument at all . <br> " How do these doctors expect us to read their chicken scratch ? " he complains , holding a streaky fax up to the overhead fluorescent lights that turn us all a sickly green hue . " Well , this medication does n't come in 3 milligram doses , " he informs the sheet of paper , " so he 's getting 5 . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way of telling me to enter the information into our computer system . By law , we are required to keep original prescriptions for five years , but there are boxes in our storeroom with scraps of paper that go back to the Cold War . <br> He limps toward me . " We 're getting a delivery in about an hour , Andrew . I need you to restock the shelves . " <br> So now I 'm a stock boy . I thought I was a pharmacy technician . <br> " I 've got quite a few more scripts to fill . Belinda can handle it , " I suggest . <br> Without taking her eyes off her magazine , Belinda crosses her wrists above her head and wiggles her fingers , hands tied . <br> Nice . <br> " I can take care of these orders just fine . You just handle the delivery . I ca n't have boxes cluttering my aisles , " Gregory continues . <br> If I do n't handle the delivery , Gregory will  --  jamming makeup , toiletries , sunglasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit . When customers ask where we keep the suntan lotion , I have to tell them over there , over there , and probably over there . <br> Between the lighting , overflowing shelves , littered aisles , and vintage dust , this place is closing in on me . <br> Day 's Pharmacy is a Crockett institution . Located at the same Pomona Street address for nearly ninety years , it is the secondoldest independent pharmacy in the East Bay and the seventh oldest in all of northern California . Everyone knows this because Gregory wo n't let us forget . The only other local business that 's been around longer is the California &amp; Hawaiian Sugar Refining Company . C &amp; H is how Crockett became " Sugar Town . " <br> Over the last one hundred years , the sugar business has been bittersweet for Crockett . Behind the walls of that massive Willie Wonka  --  like factory , you 'll find far more machines than men and women . A century ago , it took a thousand employees to churn out seventy thousand tons of Hawaiian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that , but with one-fifth the staff . Among the layoffs : my father , prompting his early retirementwith Mom to Vegas . Only half the factory is still in operation . In the late 1990s , the company sold a good chunk of its real estate to Charles Warner , a wealthy local investor . Warner Construction was supposed to convert the old C &amp; H warehouses into lofts , but development has been stalled for years . <br> There are still a few perks to having C &amp; H headquartered here . First off , every business in town gets a free complimentary supply of sugar . Then there are the Red Rockets . C &amp; H makes a limited supply of the highly coveted candy rings once a year , to coincide with the Crockett Memorial Day Parade . One of my earliest memories is coming to Day 's Pharmacy with my mother  --  right after the annual Pancake Breakfast and right before the parade  --  and Gregory handing me my first of those mouthwatering cherry-flavored delights . <br> Red Rockets have changed slightly over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic ring that you slipped on your finger with a missile-shaped sucking candy on top . But then kids started poking each other with them like weapons , we entered the Age of Lawsuits , and as a precaution , C &amp; H lopped off the tops . Now they look like nothing . Technically the shape is called a " frustum , " not that Gregory would know . I think he likes those truncated cones because they look like inverted medicine cups . That , and the power this candy represents : the only way to get a Red Rocket is to snatch one up at the Memorial Day Parade or come here . <br> It 's awe-inspiring to think that soon , Gregory will pass the candy baton to me . I have n't done a hell of a lot with my life , but " Gatekeeper of the Red Rockets " is right up there . <br> Continues ...
