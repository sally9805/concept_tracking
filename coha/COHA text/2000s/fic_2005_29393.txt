1 My name is Akiko . I 'm a pretty average fifth grader in a pretty average town that 's right in the middle of a pretty average part of the country . My life is for the most part extremely dull . For the most part . It 's the least part that 's always getting me into trouble . The part that has to do with me being taken off to other galaxies , battling strange aliens , piloting rocket ships , and , on occasion , eating in intergalactic fast-food restaurants . People are always telling me not to exaggerate . Which bugs me because I never do . It 's just that the things that happen to me tend to happen in a pretty big way . So please do n't think I 'm exaggerating when I say that the story I 'm going to tell you right now is basically about the end of the world . Well , the end of a world , anyway . Or a world that nearly came to an end . Very nearly . Maybe I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way home from school . I had just gone into Chuck 's . Chuck 's is this convenience store about three blocks from Middleton Elementary . It does n't look like much from the outside , but it has the biggest supply of bubble gum in town . All the usual gums , of course , but the rare stuff too : Arkey Malarkey 's Rain-Bo Day-Glo Sparkle Gum . Captain Zack 's Holy Mackerel Rub-A-Dubble Gum . Even Abe &; Mabel 's Pop-N-Ploppin Super-Supple Bupple-Gum ( That 's right : Bupple ) . The gum I bought that day was something I 'd never tried before . It was called Dr. Yubble 's Ooey-Gooey Double-Trouble Bubble Gum . I gave Chuck his money and got my nickel in change . Then I stepped out onto the corner , pulled out a piece of gum , unwrapped it , popped itin my mouth , and chewed . So was it double trouble ? Not really . It was gooey . And ooey . Definitely ooey . But to call it trouble ? I do n't know . That 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least it 's ooey . That 's hard to come by in a gum . So there I was , chewing gum , standing on the corner of Wabash and Fifth . The light changed and I began to cross the street . But before I got even halfway . . . BUH-WOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo A siren ! I spun around and found a black-and-white car barreling down the street at me , its siren blasting , its tires weaving back and forth . It squealed to a halt just inches from my legs . They 're pulling me over ? For what ? I looked around to see if anyone was watching ; the last thing I needed was a bunch of gawkers crowding in to see what was going on . I was lucky . The only witnesses were a grandma and her cat peering down from a third-story window across the street , and a grocer , half a block away , squinting from the shade of his awning . I turned back to face the patrol car . I 'd never been so close to one before . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on white . On the roof of the car was not one but eight flashing lights , each spinning and strobing a different color . Smoke billowed out in all directions , delivering a stink like an airport runway , only worse . This was one weird police car . The siren stopped . KLAKKA-K'CHAK ! A door popped open in the middle of the hood , and out came a small mechanized megaphone . It could have come from a sci-fi movie , except it looked more like a sixth grader 's homemade science project . It rose into a position between me and the windshield and rotated until it was pointed directly at my head . A crackle of static , then : " Please step over to the door of the vehicle , Aki " A pause . " er , little girl . " I took a few steps toward the driver 's side of the car . Aki ? Whoever was manning that megaphone had started to say my name . And he sure did n't sound like a policeman . He sounded an awful lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A cough . " The other one . " I stopped in my tracks , reversed direction , and walked to the passenger 's side of the car . There was a muffled whump and all the lights on the roof went out . Then they flashed on again . Finally there was a louder whump and they went out for good . This was not the Middleton Police . The passenger-seat window went down , and there before me was Mr. Beeba . He was dressed in his usual brown space suit and oversized yellow gloves but was wearing dark glasses for some reason . " Quickly , Akiko ! " he whispered , the words coming from both his mouth and the megaphone . " Into the backseat ! " " Shut off the dagnabbed speaker thing , will ya , Beebs ? " Spuckler Boach was at the wheel , unshaven chin , scraggly blue hair , and all . " You 're whisperin ' to the whole dang neighborhood ! " Mr. Beeba twisted a knob on the dashboard and with great effort managed to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open window I could just make out the silhouette of Gax in the backseat , his robot head quivering nervously on his long , spindly neck . " HELLO , MA'AM , " he said . " Quickly ! " Mr. Beeba said again , this time without the echo of the megaphone . It 's funny . Seeing my friends from the planet Smoo hiding in a police car was one of the silliest things I 'd ever laid eyes on . They just looked so ridiculous . But something told methe expressions on their faces , mostlythat this was no laughing matter . " Please , Akiko . " Mr. Beeba 's brow was furrowed into several chunky wrinkles . " Time is of the essence . We 'll explain later . " These guys . They always explained later . " Now , hang on a second , " I said . " This , uh . . . " I waved a hand in front of me . " This is n't a real police car . " Mr. Beeba adjusted his dark glasses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I narrowed my eyes . " It 's a spaceship , is n't it ? " He and Spuckler both nodded . I took another long look at the boxy black-and-white car parked in front of me . It was hard to believe this thing had just rocketed through a half-dozen distant galaxies before landing near the corner of Wabash and Fifth . " There ai n't no time for chitchat , ' Kiko , " Spuckler said , pulling a knob that popped open the back door on my side of the car . " Trust me , you got ta come with us . Right now . " I looked across the street and down the block . Both grandma and cat had gone inside their apartment , and the grocer was busily rearranging a pyramid of grapefruits with his back turned to me . No one would notice a thing . But . . . " Guys , guys , guys . We 've got to make some rules here . This whole **43;540;TOOLONG thing is really starting to get on my nerves . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I leaned over to get a better view of the car 's interior . My round , purple floating friend was nowhere to be seen . " He 's in trouble . " Mr. Beeba took off his dark glasses , revealing panicked eyes . " Grave , grave trouble . "
