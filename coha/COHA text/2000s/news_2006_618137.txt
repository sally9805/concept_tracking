<p> Gov . Sonny Perdue in 2004 bought $2 million worth of real estate next to an Orlando resort from a politically connected developer a year after the governor appointed him to the board that promotes economic development in Georgia . <p> Perdue reported owning 19.51 acres in his May 1 financial disclosure and valued it at $185,700 . He paid $2.038 million on Dec. 17 , 2004 , records show . Florida tax officials say the property is valued at the lesser amount because it is undeveloped and has a special tax exemption because it is listed as agricultural land . An assessor in Osceola County , where the property is located , described the acreage as woodsy swampland . <p> However , its location along I-4 and a new toll road that leads to Walt Disney World could make the land a financial bonanza for Perdue if it is developed . <p> Allen Whitston , an appraiser who has been working in the area for 20 years , said values are skyrocketing . " That market out there has gotten just hotter than Hades , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows you away . " <p> Lots of a half-acre or less at the nearby Reunion Resort &; Club are selling for $350,000 to $650,000 . Much of Perdue 's land may not be developable because it is on wetlands . But if only half of it were sold for residential lots at current prices , it would be worth several times its purchase price . <p> Perdue bought the property from Fourth Quarter Properties , which is owned by Newnan developer Stan Thomas , about a year after appointing him to what is now the Georgia Department of Economic Development board , records show . Thomas has been a major financial contributor to Perdue and the state Republican Party . <p> In response to questions faxed to Thomas about the transaction and his relationship with the governor , Thomas released a statement that said , " I am a friend and supporter of Gov . Perdue because he is an honorable , principled and ethical man . I would hope that the same would be said of me . <p> " The Florida property was sold to Gov . Perdue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the fair price expected . " <p> An account of the land deal was brought to the attention of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution by the Democratic Party . The newspaper confirmed details of the transaction through public records . <p> Bought for tax purposes <p> In an interview Tuesday , Perdue said he could see nothing improper about the investment . <p> Perdue said he sought Thomas ' help after selling 318 acres of Houston County land for about $4.4 million in June of 2004 that he and his sister inherited . Perdue said he wanted to reinvest his portion of the profits to reduce his federal tax bill . <p> Under federal tax law , a seller may avoid paying capital gains taxes on his profits by designating potential " like kind " properties he will buy with the proceeds and close on the new property within 180 days . <p> The governor said he did n't visit the property before purchasing it because his workload does n't provide him time to look at out-of-state properties . He said he did n't want to buy in Georgia because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that he was benefiting from state road projects or other public improvements . <p> " When you do n't have the time to be a good evaluator of an investment , you have to look to someone you can trust , " Perdue said . " I knew Stan was a developer , and I asked him to help me find the land . He was very helpful to me . He is the kind of person who never asked me for anything , and the kind of person you would not expect to ask you for anything . " <p> Perdue added , " You 've got to be very careful in this job who you do business with . " <p> The governor said he considers the land a " long-term investment " and has no immediate plans to develop the property . <p> Perdue 's participation in investing is a departure from the practices of previous governors . Perdue predecessors Zell Miller and Roy Barnes put their assets into blind trusts . In such an arrangement , the governor is not supposed to know how his assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he can use his position to enrich himself . <p> Perdue said he decided against putting his assets into a blind trust because he runs several farm , grain and fertilizer businesses that ca n't easily be turned over to someone to run independently . <p> " There is no requirement " that his assets be put into a blind trust , the governor said . " I do n't have investments . I have operating businesses . Operating businesses do not do well in blind trusts . <p> " Most people do n't appreciate that this is a full-time job and your personal affairs suffer , " Perdue said . <p> Russ Willard , spokesman for Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker , confirmed there is no law requiring governors to put their personal savings and investments in a blind trust during their term . <p> In his May disclosure report , Perdue reported a net worth of more than $6 million , up from $4.48 million before he took office . The new total included the Florida property he purchased from Thomas , although at the lower , taxable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP donor <p> Thomas and his companies have contributed about $300,000 to Perdue and the Georgia Republican Party over the past four years , including one $250,000 donation in January to the state GOP , according to campaign finance reports . The state party has spent $2 million on advertising this year , most of it to promote Perdue 's re-election . <p> In addition , Thomas has provided more than $11,000 worth of air travel to Perdue 's campaign and the Republican Party , according to campaign disclosure reports . He has also contributed more than $70,000 to the national Republican Party and federal candidates in recent years , including President Bush , Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( R-Ga. ) and Reps . Lynn Westmoreland ( R-Ga. ) and Phil Gingrey ( R-Ga . ) . <p> Perdue appointed Thomas to the board that oversees the Georgia Department of Economic Development in August 2003 . <p> The board meets quarterly to discuss the department 's activities , said Bert Brantley , the department 's spokesman . Board members listed on the department 's Internet pages include influential business leaders such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Griffith , founder and CEO of Golden Pantry Food Stores , and Michael Garrett , president and CEO of Georgia Power Co . <p> The department 's job is to market the state as a business location , along with touting Georgia as a tourism destination and a place to film movies . But the main task is attracting new businesses , and jobs , to the state and helping with the expansion of existing businesses . <p> Last year , Perdue credited the department with helping 254 projects involving new or expanded businesses in Georgia . More than 24,000 jobs were created through more than $5.7 billion in investment , the department says . <p> Thomas has developed shopping , office , residential and hotel complexes across the country . Consequently , many of his projects must be reviewed by state regulators , such as the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority , whose board also is appointed by the governor . A 60-acre mixed-use development being built by one of Thomas ' companies at Ga . 400 and Old Milton Parkway in Alpharetta required GRTA to issue a nonbinding recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the area . <p> There is no prohibition in Georgia law that directly addresses a governor doing business with someone he appointed to a board . But a former state official expressed concern about seeing a developer on the board of economic development . <p> R.K. Sehgal , commissioner of the Georgia Department of Industry , Trade and Tourism under Perdue 's Democratic predecessor , Barnes , said board members can gain insider information about where new industries are going . Sehgal 's agency was later renamed the Department of Economic Development . <p> Bill Bozarth , executive director of the government watchdog group Common Cause Georgia , said he could n't comment about the specifics of the sale . <p> " But in general , I would expect the governor not to appoint individuals he does business with to serve on state boards , " Bozarth said . " Any office holder should make their best effort to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest . <p> " Since Gov . Perdue , like Gov . Barnes before him , had already acquired significant wealth before entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steer clear of any involvement in business transactions which might be questioned . " <p> Perdue has been vocal about the need for high ethical standards for state officials , proposing reform measures in his first three years in office . Legislation he supported and passed by the Legislature in 2005 stressed the need for arms-length dealings between state officials and appointees . <p> ' Why ... so much for that ? ' <p> The Florida property Perdue bought from Thomas ' company could be a gold mine , whether it 's developed for commercial or residential use . <p> The nearby Reunion Resort &; Club , which is under development , has been wildly successful so far , said Whitston , the appraiser who grew up in nearby Kissimmee . <p> Development in the area is being spurred by the contruction of a $326 million , 11-mile leg of the beltway around Orlando that will include an exit near the Reunion development . The road is scheduled to be done in December . <p> Buyers are attracted to the area 's proximity to I-4 and nearby theme parks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osceola County records show Thomas ' Fourth Quarter Properties bought 62.7 acres near the Reunion Resort &; Club site from Ronald Howse for $10 million in July of 2004 . Five months later , Fourth Quarter sold almost 20 of the acres to Perdue for just over $2 million . <p> Also in 2004 , Fourth Quarter bought an additional 139.3 acres in the same Reunion area from Heller Brothers Packing Co . Inc , county records show . <p> It 's unclear what Fourth Quarter plans to do with its land holdings . County zoning officials say they 've received no zoning requests or development plans for that area recently . <p> A spokesman for the Florida-based Ginn Co. , which is developing the Reunion resort , said Tuesday his company has no plans to buy Perdue 's property . <p> The area where Perdue owns his land is called " Sand Hill . " Perdue 's site is zoned in such a way that it would allow for the development of timeshare property , said Ted Garrod , Osceola County 's director of zoning and code enforcement . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site . <p> The timeshare zoning for Perdue 's land is left over from a previous development proposal called the " Villages of Lake Wilson , " which would have turned 80 acres in the Sand Hill area into timeshares and commercial development . Potomac Land Co. , which was working with Howse at the time , proposed keeping about 26 acres of the site in open space , including wetlands present there . But Potomac Land withdrew its development proposal in 2001 when the state acquired much of the 80 acres to build a toll road through the area , Garrod said . <p> Osceola County Appraiser Atlee Mercer , said of the nearly 20 acres Perdue bought , about 12 are not currently developable because they are in wetlands . The site also has no access to roads , Mercer said , although access could be provided in the future and the land could be made developable . <p> " My concern would be , why is he paying so much money for that piece of dirt ? It is too much money  --  on the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than half of the acreage is wetlands . And in Florida , you do n't build on wetlands .
