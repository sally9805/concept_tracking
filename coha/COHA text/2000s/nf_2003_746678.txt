Undergraduates are largely unaware of the myriad information resources available to them in their university library ; thus , many students rely on publicly accessible Internet sites for their research needs . This practice severely undermines the academic research efforts of undergraduates . Contrary to student opinion , the Internet does not encompass all the world 's knowledge , nor is it likely to do so in the future . Students must learn to use specialized research tools and to approach all information sources with a critical eye . This article describes teaching strategies faculty in any discipline can use to guide their undergraduate students through the basic library research necessary for writing a solid research paper . <p> University libraries have outstanding information resources available to their student populations  --  subject encyclopedias , monographs , periodical literature , dissertations  --  and they have powerful tools for accessing these materials  --  online catalogs , subscription databases , interlibrary loan services  --  but many college students are either unaware of these resources or they do not know how to use them . Because few universities require an assessment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move from course to course with only a marginal understanding about how to use research tools and how to evaluate resources . At graduation , students lacking these information literacy skills are ill prepared to function in a technological and information-rich environment . <p> For teaching faculty , information literacy is problematic . While it is widely agreed that information literacy is an essential component of higher education , it is unclear where it fits in the university curriculum : computer science classes , writing classes , or research methods courses . In fact , information literacy transcends course content and can be developed through course work in all disciplines . It is possible for individual faculty in any discipline to design assignments that provide the framework for a mastery of information literacy skills . This article identifies essential library resources for undergraduate students and , more important , presents teaching strategies that foster the acquisition of information literacy skills in the university classroom . The Research Assignment <p> A typical undergraduate assignment involves choosing a topic in a discipline and writing a paper about it . Students are usually required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to corroborate their position . While this kind of assignment sounds straightforward , it is fraught with difficulties for undergraduates who lack information literacy skills : how does one focus a topic ; how does one find literature pertaining to the topic ; what is the " literature , " and how does one distinguish it from other published materials ? Focusing the Topic <p> As beginning researchers , undergraduates usually do not know enough about specific disciplines to choose a focused avenue of research and to develop a manageable research question . There is , however , an important library tool that can be useful to students as they work to develop their research question : the subject encyclopedia . While an encyclopedia is a tertiary source ( and therefore often overlooked by scholars ) , it is important to give it due respect as an excellent starting point for novices in the search for information . Unlike the general encyclopedia , the subject encyclopedia has longer articles that treat the topic in some depth while providing a context within the discipline . The articles present overviews , often including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among other things , that help the new researcher find a foothold in the field . Of equal importance are the bibliographies that accompany the articles . These references direct the student to further reading , allowing them to explore the topic in a systematic way . The objective in using this library tool is for students to explore the topic in a general ( non-threatening ) way , from a reputable source , and hopefully to discover in themselves a curiosity that motivates them to examine the topic further . Teaching Strategy <p> For all the merits of subject encyclopedias to the research process , do students use them ? The answer is : rarely . Few students even know they exist , having only heard about general encyclopedias such as Britannica . The search for a research question , therefore , is often performed on the Internet , at random and unreliable sites , and it often results in a mediocre pop-topic that either is too broad or is overused . To discourage such hit-or-miss tactics in the search for a research question , professors can require their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and the resulting research question , citing the specific subject encyclopedia they consulted , and providing a photocopy of one of the articles referenced in the source they used . This assignment requires students to use a reputable , published source for a cogent overview of the subject matter ; to describe in their own words what the topic means to them , and to practice the technique of following references . All of these are examples of information literacy skills , and all of them are based on critical thinking . Planning the Effective Search <p> Students who have a good sense of their topic and who have developed a strong research question are ready to plan their search strategy . The main issue facing students at this point is where to look for information , and the first place most students look is the Internet . This is not a bad idea if they are looking up movie times or ski reports or just keeping track of their bank balance . Problems arise , however , when students approach academic research in the same way they manage their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of and differences between the public Internet and the online subscription databases that university libraries and other institutions use for specialized purposes . Thus , when students think about doing online research , they often assume that the public Internet is appropriate for their needs . While there are many excellent web sites generally available  --  especially from government agencies and educational institutions  --  students doing academic research are better served by using the subscription databases they find in their university library . These databases are chosen according to strict criteria for content , usability , and relevance to the university 's curricula . <p> Subscription databases are programmed to retrieve electronic representations of published information  --  sometimes in citation form and sometimes in full text  --  based on a search statement entered by the researcher/ student . The results obtained from a database search are only as good as the search statement entered . It is therefore important that students know how to compose their database search statements effectively . The research question must be condensed into keywords or phrases that describe it . For example : <p> Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on marital satisfaction ? <p> Keywords : gender roles , marital satisfaction <p> The search statement can be developed by connecting the keywords with the word " and . " <p> Keywords : gender roles , marital satisfaction <p> Search statement : gender roles and marital satisfaction <p> In a database , this search statement returns a list of results in which both phrases are present in each retrieved item . Note , however , that some authors refer to gender roles as sex roles , or marital satisfaction as happiness in marriage , among other things . To compensate for this variation in vocabulary , and to expand the search results , it helps to search for word variations as well . For example : <p> Search statement #1 : gender roles and marital satisfaction <p> Search statement #2 : sex roles and marriage and happiness <p> Beginning students are perhaps unprepared for more advanced database searching techniques , so for this population the simplicity of having several basic search statements such as these to use in databases is entirely appropriate and certainly effective . Teaching Strategy <p> Unless students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to prepare search statements that describe their research question , it is unlikely that they will take the time or make the effort to do so . When university professors require their students to use library databases and to plan their searches before starting their online research , they discover that their students focus on their research in a more critical way . To confirm their students ' good preparation for searching databases , faculty can assign the following : after students decide upon a manageable research question , have them prepare a list of keywords , synonyms , and word variations that apply to their research question and then compose a few search statements to use in the database . Requiring that students turn in this very brief research agenda not only causes students to think ahead and with a critical eye , but also it gives the professor insight into students ' progress at an early stage in their research . It gets students in the habit of thinking about words , their meanings , and their relationships with other words . This skill is one that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Searching the Literature <p> Armed with an interesting research question and a few basic search statements that describe it , students are prepared to explore the literature of their field using subscription databases . Librarians who observe the research habits of undergraduates note that students gravitate toward general databases that provide access to short , full-text articles from newspapers , magazines , and scholarly journals . While these databases are easy to use and convenient , they are not meant to be a comprehensive source for discipline-specific literature . In general , they do not index books , documents , or dissertations ; they index a limited number of discipline-specific periodicals , and most do not index articles published prior to the 1970 's . Depending on their topic , therefore , students must also learn to use specialized research tools such as PsycINFO , the American Psychological Association 's database of the psychology literature , or ERIC , the U.S. Dept of Education-sponsored database of the education literature , among other specialized databases . Use of a subject-specific database along with a general database allows students to search the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be introduced to specialized information tools that index the full range of published materials in their field . This structure also gives students an excellent opportunity to juxtapose general and scholarly materials for better comparison and evaluation . Teaching Strategy <p> Following a brief class discussion about the differences between articles in magazines and journals , students can conduct a simple trial search of two subscription databases  --  one general , full-text database and one specialized database  --  using one of their search statements . Their assignment can be to find one magazine article in the general database and one journal article referenced in the specialized database . After reading the two articles , students can write a half-page evaluative piece ( or graphic representation ) comparing and contrasting the two articles . The professor may want to give students criteria for their evaluation , for example : do the articles have reference lists ; is any information about the authors ' credentials included with the articles ; are sources of data cited ; for what audiences do the pieces seem to have been written ; are the arguments/perspectives biased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so on . The purpose of this assignment is to nudge students into thinking critically about different sources of information and to evaluate them based on content , authority , and validity rather than on length , convenience , or entertainment value . Conclusion <p> The teaching strategies described above represent opportunities for students to explore reputable information sources in their field of study and to practice evaluating what they find . This basic preparation for a research paper guides students to a clear understanding of what they want to know , where and how to look for answers , and how to choose good , solid sources to answer their research question and write an effective paper . <p> These abilities  --  exploring information resources efficiently and critically evaluating results  --  are information literacy skills . They are best developed through regular exposure to assignments that are process oriented and that require critical thinking . Students who know how to use information resources and who recognize the essential characteristics and purposes of published materials have a critical advantage when adding to their knowledge base in any discipline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Further , because information literacy skills are transferable to other disciplines and to everyday life , students ' future learning  --  both in and out of the classroom  --  is positively impacted . <p> Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Barbara Quarton , MLIS , California State University , 5500 University Parkway , San Bernardino , CA 92407 .
