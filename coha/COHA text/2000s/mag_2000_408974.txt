The twins Maurice and Marie lived in the country of France more than two hundred years ago . " The Montgolfier brothers are sending a big balloon up into the air above the earth , " Father excitedly told Maurice , Marie , and their mother . " How will they get it into the air ? " Maurice asked . " The way I heard it , " Father told them , " the brothers were holding a paper bag over a fire , and it got away from them because the hot air got into the bag . The brothers thought and thought about that . They experimented with the idea , and now they have a huge bag made of linen to fill with hot air . " " From where do they want this balloon to leave the earth ? " Mother asked . " From our farm ! " Father said excitedly . " Five days from now . " " We can watch the big balloon ! " Marie clapped her hands . " Will the brothers be in the big balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big news ! " Father declared . " What ? " they all asked , leaning forward in their chairs beside the fireplace . " The brothers want animals from our farm to put in the balloon 's basket . " " Basket ? " Mother questioned . " Yes , the basket hangs from the bottom of the big balloon , " Father explained . " Will they fall out into the air ? " Marie worried . " What if they try to get out ? " Maurice wondered . " What if they crash to the earth ? " Mother cried . t , " The basket is so big , they say , that the animals will be safe . The balloon will , . return them to the earth , as the hot air leaves the balloon , " Father assured them . @ " Now , to which animals will we give this honor ? " There was a big silence . Marie looked at Maurice . Maurice looked at Marie . " I have Rouge , " Maurice said , his voice reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight above the earth for his red pet rooster . " I have Blanche , " whispered Marie , with pictures in her mind of her beloved , white pet duck far , far above the earth . " Hmmm . " Father said . " Both of you offered your pets . I will offer my Boucle ! " Father swallowed hard as he thought of his prize-winning curly sheep in the basket of the balloon above the earth . Soon the day dawned for the balloon flight . The farm pasture was filled with more people than Maurice and Marie had ever seen at the market fairs in the village . The fabric balloon was made ready for the large basket . The Montgolfier brothers and their helpers started to fill the balloon with the hot air so that it would fly above the earth . " Our first balloon was thirty feet in diameter and weighed three hundred pounds , just like this one , " one of the Montgolfier brothers told the people . " Ready ! " said all the men , giving the signal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the crowd of people . Marie followed , holding her white duck , Blanche , close to her heart . Maurice said words to quiet his red rooster , Rouge , who became excited when people reached out to touch the animals going into the balloon . Everyone watched as the basket swayed under the rising balloon filled with hot air . Up and up they went as the breeze became stronger . Baa-baa . The crowd could hear Boucle in the air above the earth . Quack-quack . The crowd heard Blanche in the air above the earth . Cock-a-doodle-doo . The crowd heard Rouge in the air above the earth . " What will happen to my prize sheep , Boucle ? " Father wondered . I wo n't see Blanche anymore , " sobbed Marie . " Poor Rouge , " Maurice lamented , and he set his jaw and bit his lip . " Let 's follow it ! " someone shouted from the crowd . Some people went on horses . Some went in carts . Some ran , and some walked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed her finger at the balloon . " It 's falling ! " the people shouted . Mother , Marie , and Maurice held on te the sides of the cart as Father drove over the clods of earth to cross the fields . When they reached the fallen balloon , they found it spread out like a carpet on the earth . The big basket was turned on its side . " Come here , Rouge ! " Maurice called , chasing his red rooster who was running in circles on the linen cloth . " Oh , Blanche ! " Marie exclaimed , crawling into a comer of the basket after her white duck . Quack-quack ! Blanche managed to say in a feeble voice as Marie held her close . Baa-baa ! Boucle announced , standing on legs too stiff to walk . Father carried her from the side of the balloon basket . Everyone congratulated the Montgolfier brothers . The big balloon they had sent up into the air had made a flight and returned to earth . The Montgolfier brothers thanked Father , Maurice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket . " Someday people will ride far above the earth because your pets came back alive and safe , " they said . " I want Blanche to stay in my room tonight , " Marie said when the supper chores were done " Well , " Mother considered , " she is famous . But just this one night . " " Rouge too ? " Maurice begged . " Oh , yes . " Mother laughed . Father looked at Mother . " Boucle ! Just inside the doorway this one night , " he suggested , and Mother nodded . Marie held Blanche close as the two of them entered her room . Maurice let Rouge find his own perch atop the window ledge . Father put Boucle down to bed on a blanket near the doorway . All of them slept soundly on that night long ago in the country of France . Editor 's note : Jacques and Joseph Montgolfier were among the first to experiment with hot-air balloons .
