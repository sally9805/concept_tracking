If you were a little , say , heavy-handed with the plastic this holiday season , you may find yourself regretting that behavior when the bills roll in . Why ? Banks and credit-card companies must follow new federal guidelines from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that require minimum payments to cover interest and fees plus at least 1% of the principal .

When rates adjust , says Keith Gumbinger , vice president of HSH Associates , a publisher of mortgage-rate information , you could find yourself looking at an interest rate of 7% .
