Chapter One VICKI and the others in the Dials ' underground Wisconsin hideout gathered around the television . It was two in the afternoon , and the kids expected the worst about Zeke Sr. Vicki held the phone while Mark Eisman monitored e-mail , both hoping Natalie would find a way to contact them . An earlier news report had said the first mark application had begun at a GC facility in Wheaton , formerly known as the DuPage County Jail . Other mark applications were scheduled that afternoon in various local jails and prisons . The kids had rejoiced when Conrad called with the news of the escape of Ginny and Bo Shairton , Maggie Carlson , and a former gang member who was now a believer , Manny Aguilara . All four were now in the home of Jim Dekker , a GC satellite operator from Illinois who had helped the kids . Vicki prayed for Natalie . As far as Vicki knew , Global Community Peacekeepers had n't discovered that the four former inmates were actually free . Mark fiddled with the TV antenna to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Wheaton , Illinois , broke into the newscast . " As we 've reported , the mark applications began here a little after noon today . With the new technology , Peacekeepers wondered if there would be any glitches in the system . We 're told that everything went fine until the last prisoner was brought into the application room and refused to take themark . " That set in motion a series of events that local Peacekeepers say was regrettable , but necessary . " The broadcast cut to a video feed of an interview with Deputy Commander Darryl Henderson . The man pursed his lips and shook his head . " We brought this prisoner from Des Plaines and gave him every chance to comply with the simple requirement of taking the mark of loyalty . When he refused , we had no alternative . " " Is it true you did n't expect to need the guillotine ? " the reporter said . " It 's a loyalty enforcement facilitator , " Henderson corrected . " No , we assumed that our prison population would all take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The scene switched to the reporter looking at his notes . " That one man is identified as fifty-four-year-old Gustaf Zuckermandel , formerly of Des Plaines . He had been charged with black market trafficking of fuel oil , but sources inside this facility tell me he was a follower of the dissident Tsion Ben-Judah . Officials say they hope this execution will serve as a warning to other Judah-ite followers that this kind of defiance of the Global Community will not be tolerated . " Mark turned off the television and the kids sat in silence . Vicki thought of Zeke Jr . and wondered if he knew about his father 's death . There was no denying the clear facts . They had now entered a bloody season when believers in Christ would be hunted and if caught , executed . Vicki shuddered . If she and Darrion had been caught in Des Plaines , they would have been forced to choose Carpathia 's mark or the blade . Would she have chosen to die for what she believed ? Would she have to make that choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Conrad wanted to know if the kids had heard about Zeke , and Vicki said they had . " We 're staying at Jim Dekker 's farmhouse until things settle , " Conrad said . " He wants us to take supplies with us when we go . " " What do you mean ? " " GC uniforms , ID cards-you name it , he 's got it . " Mark talked with Conrad after Vicki was through , and then the kids met to discuss their next move . " We ca n't slow down now , " Melinda said . " We have to tell as many people as we can before they take the mark . " " Pretty soon there wo n't be anyone left who 's undecided , " Janie said . " Then we 'll just have to try and survive . " " What 's important right now is getting the message to as many unbelievers as possible , " Darrion said , " and our best tool is The Cube . It 's high-tech and gets people 's attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to get the message out . " The phone rang again and Vicki jumped . Mark answered and handed it to her . " It 's Natalie . " * * * Lionel Washington hid in some bushes near the Global Community apartment building where Chang Wong and his parents stayed . Judd had given him Chang 's description , but Lionel was nervous . What if someone who looked like Chang came out of the building ? Lionel was glad Judd would be back early in the morning . Nights in New Babylon felt eerie to Lionel . The blistering heat of the day gave way to cool air once the sun went down . A breeze blew through the bushes , and Lionel hunkered down in his hiding place . Lionel had witnessed incredible things in the past few weeks . He had seen the deaths of the beloved prophets , Eli and Moishe , and a few days later had watched them ascend into heaven . That had been one of the high points of their trip to Israel . But soon after came Carpathia 's murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionel thought about it , he recalled the lightning of Leon Fortunato and the bodies of innocent victims lying in the palace courtyard . The door opened at the front of the apartment building , and a guard strolled out front , lighting a cigarette . He walked to within a few feet of Lionel 's hiding place and flicked cigarette ashes into the bushes . Thanks for using our world as your ashtray , Lionel thought , recalling the words of his father . Lionel smiled as he remembered driving in the car with his dad . A motorist would pass , flicking ashes or a spent cigarette to the pavement , and Lionel 's dad would shake his head . Once Lionel 's father had stepped out of the car at a stoplight , picked up a smoldering butt off the ground , and handed it to the driver through the open window . " I think you dropped this , " Lionel 's father had said , then returned to the car before the light changed . He buckled up and stifled a smile . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad more than he wanted to admit . They had missed so many things . With each birthday or holiday , Lionel ached for some kind of celebration , a cake , or some presents . But the truth was , the kids did n't have time for things like that . Life was a constant struggle . At moments like these , when Lionel was alone , he thought about his family , his mother 's smile , his father 's strength . Most of the kids he knew from school had parents who were divorced . His mom and dad had stayed together through some rough times and Lionel was glad . The guard flicked the spent cigarette into the bush where Lionel was hiding and walked away . The glowing ashes faded and finally went out . It was just like the world , Lionel thought , dying and almost dead . He drew his knees to his chest , wrapped himself in the light jacket he was wearing , and leaned back . The night chill and lack of activity inside the building made his eyelids droop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father . * * * Vicki tried to comfort Natalie , but the girl was nearly hysterical . When she finally calmed down , Vicki discovered that Natalie was at her apartment , having told her boss she was n't feeling well . Natalie told Vicki about her experience at the old DuPage County Jail . She had heard Zeke protest about the mark of loyalty . She had followed the man and had watched from an observation room when the Global Community ended Zeke 's life . " You actually saw the beheading ? " " I could n't watch , but I heard the blade come down . One guy in the room raised his fist and said Zeke got what he had coming to him . How can people be that cruel ? " " I do n't know . Are you all right now ? " Natalie sighed . " I just feel so alone . The GC are all saying everything went exactly as planned , but I know the truth . All those prisoners who took the mark can never become believers now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to not take it . " " Does Henderson suspect anything about the four who escaped ? " " Not that I can tell . He 's been too busy with the mark applications to notice much , but I heard they 're still looking for you . " " We 're safe . Any idea how long before employees get the mark ? " " Henderson 's sending a report to other facilities throughout the country . Jails and reeducation facilities will apply the mark for the next couple of days . Then employees are eligible . We have two weeks to comply after it 's up and running . " " Then you have to come here . " " Believe me , I ca n't stop thinking about it . But I 'm so mad . After what I saw Zeke go through , why does God let this happen ? " " I understand how you feel . I felt the same thing when my friend Ryan died . " " Why could n't somebody have told us about God before all this happened ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vicki said . " I would n't listen . " " So we just have to sit back and watch all of these good people get their heads chopped off ? Is that what God wants ? " Natalie broke down and sobbed . Vicki listened and tried to calm her . Suddenly , Natalie put her hand over the phone and said , " Hi , Claudia . Yeah , you should have been there . " When Natalie uncovered the phone , she whispered , " My roommate 's here . I 'll call you later and we can talk . " Vicki gathered the other kids to pray for Natalie . She knew the girl 's time was running out . * * * Judd Thompson Jr . crept through the darkened streets of New Babylon . A few cabs sat parked by the street , drivers slouched and snoring in their seats . A strip of yellow and white shone on the horizon as Judd looked at his watch . 6:30 A.M. I should have relieved Lionel an hour ago ! Judd located the shrubs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Judd put a hand over his mouth . " How long have you been asleep ? " Lionel rubbed his neck and yawned . " I do n't know . It was so cold and I just could n't keep my eyes open . " " I ca n't blame you . I 'm late myself . " " No word from Chang ? " " Nothing , " Judd said . " But Z-Van came in late last night jazzed up . " " About his recording ? " Judd shook his head . " He was crowing about getting to take the mark today . They 're taking pictures for the album cover , and he wants to make sure he has Carpathia 's mark . And get this . He 's supposed to have a picture taken with Carpathia . " " If they 're letting Z-Van take the mark , that means- " Judd pointed toward the front door of the apartment building . A man with a briefcase walked inside . The guard checked the man 's credentials and waved him through . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Moon , I think . He 's in Carpathia 's inner circle . " " Maybe he lives there . " Judd shook his head . " I wish we had some binoculars . " Lionel reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out a tiny telescope . " Westin gave it to me before we left last night . Works pretty well . " Judd set the digital meter for the distance and zoomed in on the scene . The scope was so powerful he could see the badge of the guard at the front door . He focused on the elevators and saw one had stopped on the fourth floor . " That 's Chang 's floor , " Judd said . * * * Vicki had trouble falling asleep , a thousand thoughts swirling through her mind . It had been some time since they had heard from Judd and Lionel , and she was worried they might be in trouble . And she thought of Zeke . She could n't shake the image of the razor-sharp blade falling . She had just gotten to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come see something . " Vicki dressed quickly and walked into the meeting area of the underground hideout . Mark had the kids ' Web site up on the large screen at the front of the room . " You 'll want to sit down for this , " Shelly said . " What 's wrong ? " Mark showed Vicki the number of messages from people who had received The Cube . Many of them had prayed to become believers because of the 3-D tool . Mark scrolled to the bottom and pulled up a message whose subject line simply said Help ! Vicki or anyone else working with the Young Tribulation Force , I 'm typing this fast , so if I make mistakes forgive me . I 'm Kelly Bradshaw from Iowa . You came to our meeting place at an abandoned college . I hope you remember us . " I remember Kelly , " Vicki said . " She was the first to meet us when we got there . " We 've had incredible growth since you came and taught us . Word spread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the notes we 'd taken . Then , when you sent The Cube , we almost doubled in size . People brought friends who had n't seen it to the locker room under the gym where we meet . Someone must have tipped off the Global Community because several Peacekeepers burst into one of our smaller meetings tonight and arrested everyone . I was on my way back to our farm when I heard them coming , but there was nothing I could do . They raided the house where some of us live , too , and took computers and supplies . We had printed copies of Buck Williams 's The Truth to hand out to people who were interested . We had a computer hidden in a secluded room . That 's where I am now , but I 'm so afraid for my friends . Can you help ? I 'm hearing they are forcing prisoners to take the mark , so we do n't have much time . Please , if there 's anything you can do , let me know quickly . " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I told her we 'd be back to her within the hour . What do we want to say ? " Vicki looked around the room . " I say these are our brothers and sisters . We have to try . " Mark smiled . " That 's what I thought you 'd say . " ( Continues ... )
