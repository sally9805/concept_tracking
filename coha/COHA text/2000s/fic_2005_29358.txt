Chapter One The fort of Mytilene loomed above them on the hill . Points of light moved on the walls as sentries walked their paths in the darkness . The oak-and-iron gate was shut and the single road that led up the sheer slopes was heavily guarded . Gaditicus had left only twenty of his men on the galley . As soon as the rest of the century had disembarked , he had ordered the corvus bridge pulled in and Accipiter slid back from the dark island , the oars barely splashing in the still seawaters . The galley would be safe from attack while they were gone . With all lights forbidden , she was a blot of darkness that enemy ships would miss unless they came right into the small island harbor . Julius stood with his unit , waiting for orders . Grimly , he controlled his excitement at seeing action at last after six months of coastal patrol . Even with the advantage of surprise , the fort looked solid and dangerous and he knew scaling the walls was likely to be bloody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rung of the ladders he had been issued , moving amongst the men to make sure they had cloths tied around their sandals for silence and better grip on the climb . There was nothing out of place , but his men submitted to the checks without complaint , as they had twice before since landing . He knew they would not disgrace him . Four were long-term soldiers , including Pelitas , who had ten years of galley experience behind him . Julius had made him the Second in the unit as soon as he realized the man had the respect of most of the crew . He had previously been overlooked for promotion , but Julius had seen the quality behind the casual approach to uniform and the quite astonishingly ugly face on the man . Pelitas had quickly become a staunch supporter of the new young tesserarius . The other six had been picked up in Roman ports around Greece , as Accipiter made up her full complement . No doubt some of them had dark histories , but the requirements for a clean record were often ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers knew their last chance for a salary was at sea , but Julius had no complaints . His ten men had all seen battle , and to listen to them tell their stories was like a summary of the progress of Rome in the last twenty years . They were brutal and hard , and Julius enjoyed the luxury of knowing they would n't shirk or turn away from the dirty jobs-like clearing the Mytilene fort of rebels on a summer night . Gaditicus walked through the units , speaking to each officer . Suetonius nodded at whatever he was told and saluted . Julius watched his old neighbor , feeling fresh dislike but unable to pin it to any one thing in the young watch officer . For a year , they had worked together with a frosty politeness that now seemed unbreakable . Suetonius still saw him as the young boy he and his friends had tied and beaten a lifetime before . He knew nothing of his experiences since then and had sneered as Julius told the men what it was like to come into Rome at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the capital were only distant rumor to the men on board , and Julius felt he was n't believed by some of Tonius 's friends . It was galling , but the first hint of tension or fighting between units would have meant demotion to the ranks . Julius had kept his silence , even when he heard Suetonius telling the story of how he had once left the other tesserarius swinging from a tree after cracking his head a few times . His tone had made the incident seem nothing more than a little rough fun between boys . He had felt Julius 's gaze on him at the end and pretended surprise , winking at his Second as they went back to their duties . As Gaditicus walked over to the last of his units , Julius could see Suetonius grinning behind his shoulder . He kept his own eyes on the centurion and saluted stiffly as he stood to attention . Gaditicus nodded to him , returning the salute with a quick motion of his right forearm . " If they do n't know we 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest before dawn . If they 've been warned , we 'll be fighting for every step . Make sure the armor and swords are muffled . I do n't want them giving the alarm while we 're on the exposed flanks of that place . " " Yes , sir , " Julius replied smartly . " Your men will attack the south side . The slope 's a little easier there . Bring the ladders in quickly and have a man at the bottom of each one to hold them steady so you do n't have to waste time looking for a firm footing . I 'm sending Suetonius 's men to kill the gate sentries . There are four of them , so it could be noisy . If you hear shouts before you 're close to the wall , sprint . We must not give them time to organize . Understand ? Good . Any questions ? " " Do we know how many are in there , sir ? " Julius asked . Gaditicus looked surprised . " We 're taking that fort whether they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two years and the local governor has been murdered . Do you think we should wait for reinforcements ? " Julius colored with embarrassment . " No , sir . " Gaditicus chuckled bitterly . " The navy is stretched thin enough as it is . You 'll get used to never having enough men and ships if you live through tonight . Now , move to your position and take a wide berth around the fort , using cover . Understand ? " " Yes , sir , " Julius replied , saluting again . Being an officer , even the lowest rank , was difficult at the best of times . He was expected to know his business , as if the ability came with the rank . He had never assaulted a fortress before by day or night , but was supposed to make decisions on the instant that could mean life or death for his men . He turned to them and felt a fresh surge of determination . He would not let them down . " You heard the centurion . Silent progress , split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thumped their right fists into their leather breastplates in acknowledgment . Julius winced at the small sound they made . " And none of that noisy business either . Until we are in the fort , any orders I give are not to be acknowledged . I do n't want you singing out ' Yes , sir ' when we 're trying to move silently , all right ? " One or two grinned , but the tension was palpable as they made their slow and careful way through the cover . Two other units detached with them , leaving Gaditicus to command the frontal attack once the sentries had their throats cut . Julius was thankful for the endless training drills as he saw the smooth way the men separated in pairs , with four of the long ladders to each unit . The soldiers could run up the wide rungs at almost full speed , and it would take only seconds to reach the top of the black walls and get into the fort . Then it would be vicious . With no way of knowing how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill as many as possible in the first few moments . He signaled with a flat palm for the men to crouch as one of the sentry torches stopped close to their position . Sounds would carry easily , despite the rhythmic screech of the crickets in the grass . After a few moments , the sentry light moved on again and Julius caught the eyes of the closest officers , nodding to each other to begin the attack . He stood and his heart beat faster . His men rose with him , one of them grunting slightly with the weight of the sturdy ladder . They began to trot up the broken rock of the south approach . Despite the muffling cloths on their sandals and armor , the thud of feet seemed loud to Julius as he broke into a light run beside his men . Pelitas was in the lead , at the head of the first ladder , but the order changed second by second as they scrambled up the uneven surface , denied even the light of the moon to see the ground . Gaditicus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passed quickly through the hands of the man in front , the trailing end planted close to the wall for maximum height . The first man held it steady while the second swarmed up into the darkness . In only a few seconds , the first group was over and the second ready to go , their climb made harder as the ladders slipped and scraped on the stone . Julius caught one as it moved , and bunched his shoulders to hold it until the weight at the top had gone , appreciating the sharp reality of levers in the process . All along the line , the soldiers were disappearing into the fort and still the alarm had not been given . He shifted the ladder until the padded head caught on something , and gripped it tightly as he climbed , having to lean close with the sharp angle . He did n't pause at the top in case archers were sighting on him . There was no time to judge the situation as he slid over the crown and dropped into the darkness below . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . Before them was a short stretch of scrub grass , grown long over ancient stones . It was a killing ground for archers and they needed to be out of it quickly . Julius saw the other units had not paused and had crossed to the inner wall . He frowned . It stood as tall as the first , only twenty feet away , but this time the ladders were outside and they were trapped between them , as the ancient designers had planned . He swore softly to himself as the men looked to him for a quick decision . Then a bell began to ring in the fort , the heavy tones booming out into the darkness . " What now , sir ? " Pelitas said , his voice sounding bored . Julius took a deep breath , feeling his own nerves settle slightly . " We 're dead if we stay here , and they 'll be throwing torches down soon to light us up for archers . You 're best in the rigging , Peli , so get your armor off and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stones are old , there should be a few gaps for you . " He turned to the others as Pelitas began to undo the lacing that held his armor together . " We need to get that ladder back . If Peli falls , we 'll be easy targets for the archers . It 's a fifteen-foot wall , but we should be able to lift the lightest pair of you to the top , where they can reach over and drag it up . " He ignored the growing sounds of panic and battle inside the fort . At least the rebels were concentrating on Gaditicus 's attack , but time had to be running out for the soldiers on his side . The men understood the plan quickly and the heaviest three linked arms and braced their backs against the dark stones of the outer wall . Two more climbed up them and turned carefully so they too were able to lean against the wall behind them . The three at the bottom grunted as the weight came to bear on their armor . The metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from above , but without them there was a good chance of snapping a collarbone . They bore the discomfort in silence , but Julius saw they could not hold for long . He turned to the last pair , who had taken off their armor and stripped down to underclothing and bare feet . Both grinned with excitement as Julius nodded to them , and they set about climbing the tower of men with the same speed and efficiency that they brought to the rigging of Accipiter . He drew his sword as he waited for them , straining to see into the darkness above . Twenty feet away , on the inner wall , Pelitas pressed his face against the cold , dry stone and began a short and desperate prayer . His fingers shook as they held a tiny space between slabs , and he fought not to make any noise as he heaved himself higher , his feet scrabbling for purchase . His breath hissed between his teeth , so loudly he felt sure someone would come to investigate . For a moment , he regretted bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest , though he could n't think of anything worse than reaching the top without a weapon . Falling off onto his head in a great crash was a similarly unpleasant prospect , however . Above him , he could see a dark lip of stone dimly outlined against the glow of torches as the fort sprang to defend itself from the fifty led by Gaditicus . He sneered silently to himself . Professional soldiers would already have sent scouts around the perimeter to check for a second force or an ambush . It was good to take pride in your work , he thought . His hand searched blindly above , finally finding a good grip where a corner had crumbled away over the centuries . His arms quivered with exhaustion as Pelitas placed a palm at last on the top slab and hung for a moment , listening for anyone standing close enough to gut him as he pulled himself into the inner fort . There was nothing , even when he held his breath to listen . He nodded to himself and clenched his jaw as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these times , then heaved up , swinging his legs around and in . He dropped quickly into a crouch and drew the gladius inch by inch , to avoid sound . He was in a well of shadow that left him invisible on the edge of a narrow platform with steps leading down to the other buildings on two sides . The remains of a meal on the ground showed him there had been a sentry in place , but the man had obviously gone to repel the front attack instead of staying where he had been told . In his head , Pelitas tutted at the lack of discipline . Moving slowly , he unwound the heavy rope from his chest and shoulders and tied one end to a rusted iron ring set in the stone . He tugged on it and smiled , letting the loops drop into the dark . Julius saw that one of the other units was pressed close to the inner wall , with the last following his idea to retrieve the ladders . Next time , they would have a rope attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last man pulling the whole thing after them , but it was easy to be wise in hindsight . Gaditicus should have spent more time learning the layout of the fort , though that was difficult enough , as nothing overlooked the steep Mytilene hill . Julius dismissed the doubt as disloyal , but a part of him knew that if he were ordering the attack , he would not have sent his men to take the fort until he knew everything there was to know about it .
