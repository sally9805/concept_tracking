<p> William Webster resigned Tuesday as chairman of a new accounting oversight board , less than three weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission tapped him for the job . <p> Webster 's departure makes him the third official to resign because of the uproar that followed his appointment . Last week , SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt resigned after admitting that he neglected to tell his fellow commissioners about Webster 's connection to an Internet entrepreneur accused of fraud . SEC chief accountant Robert Herdman also resigned over the matter . <p> Coming after a tide of disclosures about financial scandals and executive misdeeds , the flap over the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board could give investors more cause for cynicism . As the board 's four remaining members prepare for their first meeting today , advocates for accounting reform are wondering if the damage to the board 's credibility is beyond repair . <p> " I hope it 's reparable , " says Arthur Levitt , who was chairman of the SEC until Pitt took over 15 months ago . " It depends on how they reconstitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing irreparable harm , " says Nell Minow , a shareholder rights advocate and editor of The Corporate Library . " The White House and SEC could act really quickly to appoint someone outstanding . What might do irreparable harm is if the business community and elected officials take the election returns as being their get-out-of-jail-free card from reform efforts . " <p> SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan says the commission will " move expeditiously to name a new chairman " for the board . It 's not clear whether the SEC will appoint one of the four current members as interim chair or try to replace Webster directly with a new candidate . <p> " The SEC must act with wisdom and independence in selecting a chairman of the oversight board , " said Sen. Paul Sarbanes , D-Md. , co-author of the law that created the board . " This is imperative in carrying forward the reforms contained in the recently enacted investor protection legislation and in restoring investor confidence in our financial markets . " <p> The Sarbanes-Oxley corporate reform act , passed in July , gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission nearly blew that deadline last month when a dispute pitted three Republican appointees who supported Webster against two Democratic appointees who backed John Biggs , an activist pension fund manager . <p> Although Biggs still has the support of two SEC commissioners  --  Harvey Goldschmid and Roel Campos  --  he probably wo n't get the nod , given the acrimony surrounding Webster 's appointment . Following the disclosure of Webster 's involvement with U.S. Technologies CEO Greg Earls , a man with a long trail of fraud accusations in his past , Biggs called on SEC Chairman Pitt to resign . Pitt resigned on election night but agreed to stay on until a new chairman is ready to take over . <p> The new board has until April to launch its operations in earnest . Absent the Webster affair , the board would still be challenged by the Sarbanes-Oxley timetable . Now , with confusion surrounding its leadership and direction , the board 's workload is even bigger . Here 's what its members have to do : <p> * Hire staff . By April , the board should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of staff to legions of accountants and lawyers  --  on the payroll . The board 's budget is expected to be more than $ 25 million a year . <p> " You 're going to need at least 100 people . You 're setting up a real operation in the next few months , " says Charles Bowsher , who headed the Public Oversight Board , an accounting-industry body that was disbanded this year and will be replaced by the SEC-appointed panel . <p> * Find office space . That is n't simple , because it may make more sense for the board to be headquartered in New York  --  where most of the big accounting firms are  --  than in Washington , D.C. Board members may want offices in both places . <p> * Get organized . Like the SEC , the board has a chairman and four other board members . But because the SEC chairman controls all of the agency 's administrative levers , other SEC commissioners are relatively powerless . The oversight board may decide to assign administrative control to various members , giving each an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this board ought not to waste the talents of these people , " says David Ruder , professor of law at Northwestern University and SEC chairman under President Reagan . " It should ask them to supervise the administration of the organization with the chairman having the final say . Otherwise , commissioners tend to be wasted . " <p> Ruder thinks the board 's investigative and prosecutorial functions should be handled by Charles Niemeier , the chief accountant of the SEC 's enforcement division . Dan Goelzer , Ruder 's former general counsel at the SEC , could be in charge of setting rules and regulations , Ruder adds . Former congressman Willis Gradison would be a natural to handle politically sensitive duties , such as registering accounting firms . And Kayla Gillan , former chief legal adviser at CalPERS , could supervise inspections . <p> Webster 's references <p> The resignation of Webster , the highly respected former director of the FBI and CIA , is the coda to one of the most bizarre chapters in SEC history . <p> Last August , when the SEC began looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atkins suggested Webster or former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani . In September , Webster 's candidacy had no momentum . No one was sure the 78-year-old would even want the job . Instead , Pitt and commissioner Goldschmid seemed settled on Biggs , head of the pension investment fund TIAA-CREF , as the front runner . <p> The two discussed the job with Biggs on Sept. 11 . Biggs was so convinced that he was going to be asked to take the position that he accelerated his retirement plans to be free to serve . <p> At some point during the month , things changed . Pitt spoke with Rep. Michael Oxley , R-Ohio , the chairman of the House financial services committee , who suggested Biggs might turn out to be immoderately prone to activism in the job . In early October , Pitt let it be known that Biggs was no longer the favorite . <p> In mid-October Pitt and Herdman , his chief accountant , met with Webster to gauge his interest in chairing the oversight board . Although Webster was attracted by the prospect of aiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audit committee of a company called U.S. Technologies and that its CEO had been accused of fraud . <p> Pitt told Webster that Herdman would look into the matter to determine whether that information would affect his candidacy . It is not known whether Herdman conducted any kind of background search of the matter , since a quick scan of the SEC 's own records would show that the company 's audit committee had fired U.S. Technology 's auditor , BDO Seidman , after the accounting firm said the company 's financial record keeping had material deficiencies . Webster has said the auditor was dropped because it charged too much and took too long to complete its work . <p> Before the commission 's vote to select Webster , White House chief of staff Andrew Card urged Webster to take the $ 500,000-a year job . On Oct. 25 , a commission split along party lines voted 3-2 to make Webster chairman . Dissenting Democratic appointees Goldschmid and Campos praised him as a great public servant but said he did n't have Biggs ' understanding of the issues facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times disclosed Webster 's history with U.S. Technologies and Earls , forcing Pitt to admit to his fellow commissioners that he had n't told them everything prior to the Oct. 25 vote . The revelation sparked four investigations into the selection process and Webster 's history at the company . <p> The disclosure also forced Pitt and Herdman to resign last week . Webster said he 'd serve on the new board until such time as his involvement with Earls became an unnecessary distraction to the board 's work . After a weekend of reflection , Webster resigned Tuesday afternoon . <p> Meanwhile Tuesday , new evidence emerged that Webster and other U.S. Technologies board members were warned last March about several civil fraud lawsuits involving Earls . New York attorney Stanley Arkin says he sent Webster and other directors copies of an action that accused an Earls-controlled firm of defrauding a trust that invested nearly $ 4.5 million to buy U.S. Technologies stock . <p> The case contained references to other lawsuits , including one that spelled out a scenario in which Earls allegedly used investments from an unrelated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On March 20 , Earls sent board members a written reply that called the charges " allegations , not proven facts " that he " vigorously disputed . " <p> Massachusetts businessman Arthur Maxwell said in an interview Tuesday that he , Webster and others who were on the U.S. Technologies board at the time repeatedly discussed the allegations . Board members took no action , Maxwell said , " because we had no way to be able to get any of the information to determine whether the charges had merit .
