Introduction Chaos and Transformation // Peter Jenner is a man who knows his " freak-outs "  --  sixties terminology for an intense , drug-induced emotional experience . He was Pink Floyd 's first manager , after all , and he has remained one of the industry 's most forward-looking thinkers for forty years . So when he spoke to a room full of music executives in the fall of 2006 at the Future of Music Policy Summit in Montreal , his assessment of their business resonated . // " We are in the midst of a technological freak-out , " he said . " The business is broken .... Digital technology is fundamentally changing our business in a way that no development of the last two hundred years equals , except the onset of electricity . " // Jenner described a worst-case scenario for people who had made a lucrative living as middlemen in the twentieth-century music business , the conduits between musicmakers and consumers . The Internet was making them obsolete . // " We 're trying to force a nineteenth- and twentieth-century business model into twenty-first-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised we 're in chaos . " // Peer-to-peer file sharing had turned consumers into distributors . CD burners had turned them into manufacturers . This shift in responsibilities left the industry with only one role : as " policeman ... hostile to consumers ... and stopping progress . " // In a report prepared that same year , Beyond the Soundbytes , Jenner expanded on his disdain for this shortsighted response : " The flagrant spread of ' Internet piracy ' in developed countries is a reflection of the failure of the industry as a whole to develop an appropriate copyright response to the distribution and remuneration options made possible by the new technologies . " // He mocked the industry 's response to the new challenges posed by Internet distribution and peer-to-peer file sharing : hand-wringing , followed by litigation , in which " the endless predictions of victory reminds one of the Vietnam War . " // We were back in the sixties again , when Rock ' n ' Roll Inc. was still in its infancy . Now four decades later , it was looking like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making ninety-five percent of the money , the system is broken , " Daniel Levitin , a McGill University music professor , proclaimed . // Through the breach rushed a new generation of bands and fans empowered by personal computers and broadband Internet connections . Willy-nilly they forged a new world of music distribution that seized control from once all-powerful music and radio conglomerates . // In less than a decade , a new Internet-savvy music hierarchy had been created . Commercial radio , MTV , retail stores , and record companies lost their exclusive tastemaker status , while consumers morphed into de facto music programmers who shared information and music via message boards , Web pages , e-zines , and M blogs. // In the process , more people than ever were creating and consuming music . Without a physical product to sell , costs sunk for recording and distributing music . At the same time , opportunities to be heard increased . In this world , the fringe players could more easily find and build a dedicated audience , and a musical ecosystem encompassing thousands of microcultures began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of massive niche markets rather than a mass market , " Jenner said . This was bad news for people awaiting the next Beatles or the new U2  --  a band that could unite the masses in a whirlwind of hits and hype . For everybody else , this was an opportunity for more music to flourish in more places than ever . // In this broader , more diversified world , bands such as Montreal 's Arcade Fire , Seattle 's Death Cab for Cutie , and Omaha 's Bright Eyes rose to prominence . They were viral success stories , selling out shows around the world before they were selling albums in the kind of numbers that would make the majors take notice of them . // It was enough to make Death Cab for Cutie 's Chris Walla proselytize like a digital evangelist : " This is the golden age of the Internet . The laptop kids have clued in everybody else to what 's going on : radio , television , the record industry  --  they 're all following the Internet 's lead . Because those kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any media corporation . " // Who knew a laptop could be so empowering ? The music industry sure did n't . But the Internet turned fans into gatekeepers . It also gave bands an independence they never had : the ability to communicate directly with their fans in ways their predecessors never could have imagined . // Consider that when the nineties roared to a close with CDs generating millions in profit , the industry consisted of six multinational record labels , and a single corporation ( SFX , soon to be bought out by Clear Channel ) that dominated the concert and commercial radio businesses . The primary decisions about what kind of music most of America would hear and how consumers would access that music ( through radio , retail , and touring ) were essentially being made by a few dozen key executives at a handful of companies . // But that power structure , the by-product of a century 's worth of empire building , started to crumble the instant the first music file was ripped onto a computer hard drive and shared online . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napster to court in 2000 and held back the Internet tide for a few months . But as independent producer Steve Albini said , " It 's like trying to hold back the ocean , like trying to keep the sun from rising every morning . It 's a whole new era , except the music industry does n't know it yet . " It would find out soon enough . // In the fall of 2000 , Radiohead 's Kid A was a Napster-fueled hit on the Internet long before it arrived in record stores . The esoteric album barely registered on commercial radio ; but it was in heavy rotation on the Net months before its release . The result was a number one album , an extraordinary confluence of underground taste and mass popularity . // The industry responded not with vigorous new ideas , but with strong-arm tactics and threats . It served fans not with digital innovation but with lawsuits  --  more than twenty thousand in a span of four years , in an attempt to intimidate consumers away from file sharing . // Seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website , without the aid of a record label . // The cost to fans ? " It 's up to you , " Radiohead told them . // In contrast to the major labels , the band embraced one of the fundamental principles of good business : the customer is always right . It was a moment of clarity , a moment in which the future finally overtook the past . The following pages contain the story of that transformation.Copyright ? 2009 by Greg Kot // 1 Consolidated to Death // In February 1999 , Sheryl Crow found herself in the strange position of having won a Grammy Award for an album put out by a record label that no longer existed . // In the weeks before the Grammys , A&amp;M  --  the record label that had signed her , nurtured her career , and overseen her rise from Los Angeles studio singer to international rock star over the previous decade  --  was gutted and folded into the Interscope label as part of the newly formed Universal Music Group . The demise of A&amp;M was the result of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // As the rest of the industry celebrated itself at the Grammys , Crow saw trouble ahead . In her acceptance speech , the singer delivered something of a eulogy for her old label . She was the only artist at the nationally televised ceremony to publicly acknowledge the huge toll exacted by the wave of consolidation that had washed over her profession . // Up until a few months before , she had been working for one of the smaller major-label companies , headed by veteran music executive Al Cafaro ; now Cafaro and A&amp;M were gone and she found herself under contract to the world 's largest record company , headed by Edgar Bronfman Jr . The immediate costs of the merger were easy to quantify : besides Cafaro , more than twenty-five hundred employees lost their jobs and 250 bands lost their deals with labels such as A&amp;M , Geffen , Mercury , Island , and Motown. // But in the long term , the effects of consolidation would be even more profound , and usher in a decade when the twentieth-century music industry would suddenly find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit of profit at the expense of the cornerstone principle that had allowed it to thrive for decades : artist development , as nurtured by savvy executives who not only knew their business but knew their music . // Now Cafaro , a music lifer , was out , and Bronfman , a longtime liquor magnate , was in . He 'd soon head the biggest music corporation in the world . Bronfman was heir to the Seagram fortune and was running the family business in the nineties when he sought to diversify the company 's holdings by branching out into music . As with the other moneymen taking power in the consolidation-heavy nineties , music was not central to his vision but rather a piece in a larger portfolio of products . // Cafaro was one of Crow 's champions ; he had signed her to her first record deal in 1991 and had allowed her to rerecord her debut album because she was dissatisfied with the initial results . Cafaro 's faith was rewarded with a hit : Tuesday Night Music Club established Crow as an artist to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 4 million copies and her career flourished ; her 1999 Grammy was her sixth . // Yet she was n't in a particularly celebratory mood in the days after the ' 99 ceremony . // " It 's a frightening time as far as the music industry being an artist-nurturing industry , " she said . " Now everything is so numbers-oriented and new artists get one shot , maybe two , to get a hit , and that 's it . They sign two-album deals now . I was signed to seven albums and I was given a chance to get on the road and hone my craft . You want artists who have a strong point of view , who have the potential to grow into something wonderful , like Jackson Browne and Joni Mitchell , who found themselves by touring and continuing to write , and their album sales slowly grew . But now artists are n't getting that opportunity because there 's pressure to have instant hits . " // Consolidation was the era 's trendiest business strategy . It caught on because it enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting overlapping positions and payroll , and explore new revenue streams . By the late nineties , Wall Street was rife with merger news , and deals that further centralized power in the record , radio , and concert industries were brokered . Power was concentrated in fewer hands than ever : the PolyGram-Universal merger left five multinational conglomerates to run the $14.6 billion-a-year record industry . Ten conglomerates accounted for 62 percent of the gross revenue in the $10.2 billion commercial-radio business , and one company  --  SFX Entertainment  --  dominated the $1.5 billion concert-touring industry . // One side effect of this strategy profoundly affected consumers : the price for music spiked . Compact disc prices approached a record $19 , even though the manufacturing cost had actually declined since the discs came into the marketplace in the early eighties . Tickets for major shows skyrocketed . Indirectly , an even steeper price was being paid : concerts were being transformed into marketing opportunities for a vast network of products . // Enter New York-based SFX , which bought more than a hundred major concert venues nationwide and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1999 , SFX had a hand in producing 60 percent of the two hundred biggest revenue-generating shows ; the concert industry had its biggest year ever , with $1.5 billion in sales . The reason ? Ticket prices had increased a whopping $10 a ticket , a 30 percent increase over 1998 , to an average of $44. // With consolidation came pressure to produce profit . The multinationals were effectively run by their shareholders , who wanted a steady flow of quarterly returns to justify their investment . But in an industry supposedly devoted to creating a highly volatile and unpredictable product  --  music  --  this was hardly a sound strategy . How to reconcile the whims of creativity with the need for producing profit on a prescribed schedule ? // " That 's a big problem because Wall Street is looking for stability  --  quarter-over-quarter growth  --  in an industry that is dependent on artists , " whose creativity ca n't be doled out in quarterly spurts , said Michael Nathanson , a New York investment counselor. // His words  --  delivered in 1999 at the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent " Amens " from a roomful of music executives , many of whom must 've felt like they were attending their own wake . Each of their jobs was in jeopardy as longtime record labels were folded inside Godzilla-sized multinational corporations . // " Every day the corporation became more and more powerful inside of the company and suddenly it was our total focus , rather than the consumers , or the artists , " said Howie Klein , a longtime old-guard executive who ran Reprise Records until he was deemed expendable in 2000 . " And at a certain point , it was n't even the shareholders we were serving , but the Wall Street analysts . We were there for the short-term needs of Wall Street , which is antithetical to the needs of a company that is supposedly founded on music . The industry was built on signing artists with a strong vision , and trusting that vision to do good work over a long period of time . Your job as a record-company man was to help them realize that . Former Warner executive Lenny Waronker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist , you can never go wrong . ' " // Klein 's view of the industry he once knew is highly romanticized . There were always plenty of bloodsuckers in it for a quick buck . But Klein had his priorities straight . In the eighties , he had started a fine independent label , 415 Records , in his San Francisco bedroom . When he was able to finally pay himself $100 a week , it was a big deal . " I 'd never seen a three-figure salary before , " he says now with a laugh . Later he was mentored by some of the best minds in the business , including Sire 's Seymour Stein and Warner Bros . ' Mo Ostin , and he 'd help nurture the careers of artists and bands such as Romeo Void , Lou Reed , and Depeche Mode . // To a large extent , those artists built a career by being different . It was their idiosyncrasies that made them interesting and gave them staying power . But the industry of the late nineties did n't want idiosyncrasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payback was in . In the late nineties the acts dominating the charts were marketing triumphs more than creative ones : Britney Spears , ' N Sync , the Backstreet Boys , Ricky Martin , and Will Smith . They were the kind of telegenic , cross-format acts that could be sold quickly through a variety of mediums . // " There is so much pressure on the people at the label to generate profits that the music is n't allowed to breathe and artists are n't allowed to develop , " said Moby , who had just signed a deal with an independent label , V2 Records , and released what would be his biggest record , Play . // " It makes bad creative sense , and it makes bad business sense . Under the circumstances of the music business right now , Bruce Springsteen and Fleetwood Mac would have been dropped long before they had a hit because their first few records did n't do that well . Prince 's first few records were not huge sellers . So the major labels in the pursuit of quarterly profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music that works on the radio but does n't generate any loyalty . There 's no room for idiosyncratic artists . You have to fit the mold , and radio defines that mold . Right now , if you 're not a teen pop star , an R&amp;B artist , a hip-hop artist , a generic alternative rock band , or a female singer-songwriter , you might as well not even think about making records . " // That mold was set largely by two monoliths : MTV and commercial radio . To get the word out about its latest music , record companies had to do business with both . And both were becoming increasingly narrow outlets for only the most heavily budgeted music . Though MTV launched in 1981 by playing music videos round the clock , it was now much like any other cable television station . Nonmusic programming dominated its schedule , and videos were confined to a select few superstars . Commercial radio was still the kingmaker as far as hits were concerned , and in the consolidation era it was all about centralized decision making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly difficult to tell apart . // The trend was accelerated by the 1996 Telecommunications Act , the first major overhaul of U.S. telecommunications law since 1934 . It eliminated most media ownership laws . Section 202 of the act , in particular , would prove to have a major impact on music ; it required the Federal Communications Commission to eliminate " any provisions limiting the number of AM or FM broadcast stations which may be owned or controlled by one entity nationally . " // That decree quickly led to the rapid near monopolization of the radio industry by a handful of corporations , most notably Clear Channel Communications . In 2000 , the San Antonio , Texas-based radio conglomerate further expanded its interests by acquiring SFX . It was a move hailed by the company as a triumph of synergy that would enable Clear Channel stations to promote concerts in Clear Channel concert venues . By 2002 , the company owned more than twelve hundred radio stations , covering 247 of the nation 's top 250 markets , and controlled the biggest concert venues nationwide . // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are committed to public service and who are top broadcasters is good for the public , " said Randy Michaels , the CEO of Clear Channel from 1999 to 2002 . " When we were in the mom-and-pop era , half the radio stations were owned by people who were as interested in playing what they liked as opposed to really serving the public . When you have professional management , who is focused on serving the listener , then of necessity we are obsessed with what the public wants , and we work every day to give them what they want . " // But the numbers told a different story . At the time Michaels was interviewed , Arbitron surveys showed that the average time spent listening to radio by consumers twelve years old and older had dropped 9 percent since deregulation . The young especially were tuning out : teenage listeners were down 11 percent , and listeners between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four had declined 10 percent . From 1998 to 2008 , the average share of Americans listening to radio at any given time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not that radio stations were trying to give listeners what they wanted so much as fretting about chasing them off with new , unfamiliar music . In this environment , taking chances on unproven artists supported by underfunded independent labels was considered bad business . // Clear Channel 's Michaels argued that listeners did n't want adventuresome music chosen for reasons of taste ; they wanted familiarity . His argument was n't particularly new ; corporations had always put making a buck ahead of aesthetics . But now that philosophy was integral to the corporate culture . " We all have nostalgia for the way things were , but radio is experiencing the same kind of consolidation that every other business has seen , " Michaels said . " I love to visit small towns and eat at the mom-and-pop restaurants . But more and more it 's getting harder to do , because there are a million choices and the chain restaurants are nudging out the mom-and-pop places . There are people , including me , who think that 's bad . But people want to eat at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of locally owned stations , such as WMPS in Memphis , were hanging tough by reviving some of the adventurousness and eclecticism of FM radio 's free-form golden age in the seventies . WMPS 's playlist blended Ben Harper , R.E.M. , and Ani DiFranco with hard-core country acts ( Rodney Crowell ) , Tex-Mex roots groups ( Los Super Seven ) , and independent local artists . // " We play records based on gut instinct , " said WMPS program director Alexandra Inzer , an adventurer marooned in an ocean of Clear Channel vanilla . " The problem with radio today is that corporations have paid a tremendous amount to buy these properties , so they ca n't afford to take a risk , which makes for really boring radio . Our approach is risky , and our audience is smaller because of it . But the ones who do like it stick with us . They have the station on for long periods because they 're not going to hear the same songs over and over . " // A similar philosophy prevailed at locally owned WWCD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked records by indie artists and local rockers into its rotation in a town where rigorously programmed playlists by Clear Channel and Infinity stations predominated . // " This conglomeration thing has totally ruined our industry , " said WWCD program director Andy Davis . " I think people are listening to radio less and disappointed more when they do listen . We are fortunate to be owned by a local guy who loves music , who has a passion for new and progressive sounds . But always lingering in the back of my mind is that the next quarter could be our last , because there are n't many of us left . " // Indeed , no comment summarized commercial radio 's attitude toward music more succinctly than one made by Clear Channel chairman Lowry Mays to Fortune magazine in 2003. // " We 're not in the business of providing news and information , " he said . " We 're not in the business of providing well-researched music . We 're simply in the business of selling our customers products . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
