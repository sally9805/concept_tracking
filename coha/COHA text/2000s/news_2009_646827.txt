PORT CHARLOTTE , Fla.  --  Joe Maddon would like to wave a wand and make it go away . <p> Not the Tampa Bay Rays 2008 season . It 's the frequent description of it as magical that bothers the Rays manager . <p> " When you win 97 games , win this division and go to the World Series , how can that be a fluke ? " Maddon says as he prepares his team to prove his point this year . " ( Magical ) is just somebody justifying wanting to say it . " <p> Their season certainly was unexpected and a turning point for a long-downtrodden franchise . Now the Rays are moving on . They have no choice , because they 're still in the American League East and a meteoric rise was never their aim . <p> Sustainability was . And the 2009 squad  --  at least on paper  --  appears a strong candidate to build upon the foundation laid by the ' 08 Rays . <p> " We 're better , " Maddon says after an offseason in which a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the middle of the lineup . " I know everybody 's better . It 's a way of life in this division . <p> " The Yankees pitching staff is vastly improved . The Boston Red Sox have a great team concept . Baltimore 's getting better , and nobody 's talking about them . My concern is how we 're doing . " <p> Just fine is the assessment from the team the Rays edged for the division title , then defeated in a seven-game AL Championship Series . <p> " If we think , ' Oh , they had a magical year and they 're not going to be around , we 're all crazy , " Red Sox manager Terry Francona says . " They 're not old . They 're not going to forget how to play . " <p> More important is the word in the Rays clubhouse . All is well , at least from where reliever Troy Percival sits . <p> " This year , I 'm just sitting in my corner enjoying my time , " says Percival , 39 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a job to do other than pitch . " <p> That job was to help create a personality and a tone of accountability and professionalism that Maddon wanted on a mostly young team . It was a task Percival called " easier than expected , " thanks to the Rays ability to relax and play hard . <p> Maddon , though , is taking no chances . While he says he realizes as pennant winners his team becomes a target , he 's taking aim at his players . <p> " We ca n't travel the same road , " Maddon says . " They 're going to hear me say that a lot . The moment you think you do n't have to say it , that 's when it runs away on you . It was important to bring the message the very first day . " <p> The manager 's first message was this year 's version of his 2008 slogan " 9=8 , " which meant nine guys playing hard for nine innings could equal one of baseball 's eight playoff spots . This year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 09 can be greater than ' 08 . " <p> " We have the math right this year , " Maddon says . <p> But do they have the formula ? <p> Emulating the Braves <p> Sustaining the success is the real goal . The model to emulate is the one that began with the 1991 Atlanta Braves , who got to the World Series after averaging 96 losses the previous six seasons . Atlanta did n't miss the playoffs again until 2006 , winning the 1995 World Series along the way . <p> " A lot of clubs demonstrate short-term success , " says Braves President John Schuerholz , who was general manager during the successful run . " The challenge is in sustaining it . You have to have a legitimate commitment to scouting and player development . " <p> The Rays agree , and they have little choice . Though their 2009 payroll will jump to more than $60 million from last year 's $43.8 million and 2007 's $24.1 million , that 's hardly the division 's high-rent district . The Yankees spent $209.1 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should come close to matching this year . <p> " We are much more reliant on young players than the other teams in our division , " Rays executive vice president Andrew Friedman says . " And we worked to be a destination . " <p> That 's a destination not only for young players in the farm system but also for free agents looking for a place to sign . Braves manager Bobby Cox concedes his team might not have sustained its success had pitcher Greg Maddux not found the team attractive enough to join as a free agent after the Braves returned to the World Series in 1992 . <p> The Rays suddenly have that combination of success and a promising outlook . That helped them attract Burrell , the left fielder on the Philadelphia Phillies team that beat them in last year 's World Series . It also helped them augment the bullpen with Joe Nelson , who had a 2.00 ERA for the Florida Marlins last season and had passed through the Tampa Bay organization in 2005 . <p> " It 's definitely a different regime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the approach were the first things I was impressed with . It was a big attraction . I knew how talented they were . " <p> Good fortune , though , is part of the equation . <p> " We had a nice team , " Cox says of his 1992 club . " The defense had improved so much . But old Lady Luck plays a big part in it . Health is huge . " <p> And the AL East could be close enough to hinge on injuries . <p> Rays center fielder B.J. Upton probably wo n't be ready for opening day after he bruised his left hand last week ; he already was coming back from offseason surgery on his left shoulder . <p> Rookie Fernando Perez , once regarded as a possible replacement for Upton , will miss most of the season after dislocating his left wrist . Matt Joyce , acquired from the Detroit Tigers as a candidate for the right-field job , began hitting last week and just started playing in the field because of tendinitis in his right leg . <p> Player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rays have been accumulating comes into play . Maddon still has major league veterans Gabe Kapler and Gabe Gross plus versatile Ben Zobrist , who played six positions last year , to fill in while Upton is out and to take care of right field . <p> The depth is even more pronounced on the pitching staff , so much so that October sensation David Price might not make the opening-day roster . <p> The rookie left-hander has allowed one run in 8 ... " innings this spring after posting a 1.59 ERA as a reliever in last year 's playoffs . The Rays even opened up the fifth spot in their rotation by trading Edwin Jackson to Detroit for Joyce . <p> But Price could begin the regular season in the minor leagues for two reasons : depth and that emphasis on player development . <p> Two other candidates for the rotation , Jason Hammel and Jeff Niemann , have pitched well at times this spring and are out of options , meaning the Rays risk losing them to another team if they try to send either to the minors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the franchise 's most valuable assets and has never thrown more than 133 innings in a season , which he did in his final year at Vanderbilt in 2007 . <p> " We can preach patience now , " Maddon says . " When it comes to development , sometimes patience is the best thing . " <p> In a spring when attendance is down at most exhibition game sites , the Rays sold out their 16-game home schedule at their new , 6,823-seat Port Charlotte complex . Maddon recalls watching the seemingly unending line of cars kicking up dust as they entered the parking lot before the first game . <p> " It was like Field of Dreams , " he said . " If it had been twilight , it would have been perfect . Build it and they will come . " <p> The Rays are building more than a spring training site . They hope they 're building a tradition . <p> " People want to come here now , " Percival says . " You want to be part of this . " <p> Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this document .
