" Geologic Time Includes Now " // This is the most beautiful place on earth . // There are many such places . Every man , every woman , carries in heart and mind the image of the ideal place , known or unknown , actual or visionary .... There 's no limit to the human capacity for the homing sentiment . Theologians , sky pilots , astronauts have even felt the appeal of home calling to them from up above , in the cold black outback of interstellar space . // For myself I 'll take Moab , Utah . I do n't mean the town itself , of course , but the country which surrounds it  --  the canyonlands . The slickrock desert . The red dust and the burnt cliffs and the lonely sky  --  all that which lies beyond the end of the roads . //  --  Edward Abbey , Desert Solitaire // Fraying contrails streak another bluebird sky above the red desert plateau , and I wonder how many sunburnt days these badlands have seen since their creation . It 's Saturday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biking by myself on a scraped dirt road in the far southeastern corner of Emery County , in central-eastern Utah . An hour ago , I left my truck at the dirt trailhead parking area for Horseshoe Canyon , the isolated geographic window of Canyonlands National Park that sits fifteen air miles northwest of the // legendary Maze District , forty miles southeast of the great razorback uplift of the San Rafael Swell , twenty miles west of the Green River , and some forty miles south of I-70 , that corridor of commerce and last chances ( next services : 110 miles ) . With open tablelands to cover for a hundred miles between the snowcapped ranges of the Henrys to the southwest  --  the last range in the U.S. to be named , explored , and mapped  --  and the La Sals to the east , a strong wind is blowing hard from the south , the direction I 'm heading . Besides slowing my progress to a crawl  --  I 'm in my lowest gear and pumping hard on a flat grade just to move forward  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washboarded road . I try to avoid the drifts , but occasionally , they blanket the entire road , and my bike founders . Three times already I 've had to walk through particularly long sand bogs . // The going would be much easier if I did n't have this heavy pack on my back . I would n't normally carry twenty-five pounds of supplies and equipment on a bike ride , but I 'm journeying out on a thirty-mile-long circuit of biking and canyoneering  --  traversing the bottom of a deep and narrow canyon system  --  and it will take me most of the day . Besides a gallon of water stored in an insulated three-liter CamelBak hydration pouch and a one-liter Lexan bottle , I have five chocolate bars , two burritos , and a chocolate muffin in a plastic grocery sack in my pack . I 'll be hungry by the time I get back to my truck , for certain , but I have enough for the day . // The truly burdensome weight comes from my full stock of rappelling gear : three locking carabiners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rappel device , two tied slings of half-inch webbing , a longer length of half-inch webbing with ten prestitched loops called a daisy chain , my climbing harness , a sixty-meter-long and **31;666;TOOLONG dynamic climbing rope , twenty-five feet of one-inch tubular webbing , and my rarely used Leatherman-knockoff multi-tool ( with two pocketknife blades and a pair of pliers ) that I carry in case I need to cut the webbing to build anchors . Also in my backpack are my headlamp , headphones , CD player and several Phish CDs , extra AA batteries , digital camera and mini digital video camcorder , and their batteries and protective cloth sacks . // It adds up , but I deem it all necessary , even the camera gear . I enjoy photographing the otherworldly colors and shapes presented in the convoluted depths of slot canyons and the prehistoric artwork preserved in their alcoves . This trip will have the added bonus of taking me past four archaeological sites in Horseshoe Canyon that are home to hundreds of petroglyphs and pictographs . The U.S. Congress added the isolated canyon to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etchings and paintings found along the Barrier Creek watercourse at the bottom of Horseshoe , a silent record of an ancient people 's presence . At the Great Gallery , dozens of eight-to-ten-foot-high superhumans hover en echelon over groups of indistinct animals , dominating beasts and onlookers alike with their long , dark bodies , broad shoulders , and haunting eyes . The superbly massive apparitions are the oldest and best examples of their design type in the world , such preeminent specimens that anthropologists have named the heavy and somewhat sinister artistic mode of their creators the " Barrier Creek style . " Though there is no written record to help us decipher the artists ' meaning , a few of the figures appear to be hunters with spears and clubs ; most of them , legless , armless , and horned , seem to float like nightmarish demons . Whatever their intended significance , the mysterious forms are remarkable for their ability to carry a declaration of ego across the millennia and confront the modern observer with the fact that the panels have survived longer and are in better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization . This provokes the question : What will remain of today 's ostensibly advanced societies five thousand years hence ? Probably not our artwork . Nor any evidence of our record amounts of leisure time ( if for no other reason than most of us fritter away this luxury in front of our television sets ) . // * * * // In anticipation of the wet and muddy conditions in the canyon , I 'm wearing a pair of beat-up running shoes and thick wool-blend socks . Thus insulated , my feet sweat as they pump on my bike pedals . My legs sweat , too , compressed by the Lycra biking shorts I 'm wearing beneath my beige nylon shorts . Even through double-thick padding , my bike seat pummels my rear end . Up top , I have on a favorite Phish T-shirt and a blue baseball cap . I left my waterproof jacket back at my truck ; the day is going to be warm and dry , just like it was yesterday when I biked the twelve-mile loop of the Slick Rock Trail over east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a slot canyon would be the last place I 'd be headed , jacket or no. // Lightweight travel is a pleasure to me , and I 've figured how to do more with less so I can go farther in a given amount of time . Yesterday I had just my small CamelBak with a few bike-repair items and my cameras , a measly ten-pound load for the four-hour loop ride . In the evening , paring out the bike gear , I hiked five miles on an out-and-back visit to a natural arch out toward Castle Valley , carrying only six pounds total of water and camera equipment . The day before , Thursday , with my friend Brad Yule from Aspen , I had climbed and skied Mount Sopris , the 12,995-foot monarch of western Colorado , and had carried a few extra clothes and backcountry avalanche rescue gear , but I still kept my load under fifteen pounds . // My five-day road trip will culminate on Sunday night with an unsupported solo attempt to mountain bike the 108-mile White Rim Trail in Canyonlands National Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three days it took me the first time I rode that trail in 2000 , I 'd have a sixty-pound pack and a sore back before I went ten miles . In my planning estimates this time around , I am hoping to carry fifteen pounds and complete the loop in under twenty-four hours . It will mean following a precision-charted water-management plan to capitalize on the scarce refilling opportunities , no sleeping , and only the bare minimum of stopping . My biggest worry is n't that my legs will get tired  --  I know they will , and I know how to handle it  --  but rather that my , uh , undercarriage will become too sensitive to allow me to ride . " Crotch coma , " as I 've heard it called , comes from the desensitizing overstimulation of the perineum . As I have n't ridden my bike any extended distance since last summer , my bike-saddle tolerance is disconcertingly low . Had I anticipated this trip prior to two nights ago I would have gone out for at least one long ride in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I called off a mountaineering trip at the last moment on Wednesday ; the cancellation freed me for a hajj to the desert , a pilgrimage for warmth to reacquaint myself with a landscape other than wintry mountains . Usually , I would leave a detailed schedule of my plans with my roommates , but since I left my home in Aspen without knowing what I was going to do , the only word of my destination I gave was " Utah . " I briefly researched my trip options by consulting my guidebooks as I drove from Mount Sopris to Utah Thursday night . The result has been a capriciously impromptu vacation , one that will even incorporate dropping in on a big campout party near Goblin Valley State Park tonight . // It 's nearing ten-thirty a.m. as I pedal into the shade of a very lonesome juniper and survey my sunbaked surroundings . The rolling scrub desert gradually drops away into a region of painted rock domes , hidden cliffs , weathered and warped bluffs , tilted and tortured canyons , and broken monoliths . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbey 's country , the red wasteland beyond the end of the roads . Since I arrived after dark last night , I was n't able to see much of the landscape on my drive in to the trailhead . As I scan the middle ground to the east for any sign of my destination canyon , I take out my chocolate muffin from the Moab grocery 's bakery and have to practically choke it down ; both the muffin and my mouth have dried out from exposure to the arid wind . There are copious signs of meandering cattle from a rancher 's ongoing attempt to make his living against the odds of the desert . The herds trample sinuous tracks through the indigenous life that spreads out in the ample space : a lace of grasses , foot-tall hedgehog cacti , and black microbiotic crust cloak the red earth . I wash down the rest of the muffin , except for a few crumbs in the wrapper , with several pulls from the CamelBak 's hydration tube fastened to my shoulder strap . // Remounting , I roll down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of me , but at the top of the next hill , I 'm thrust into battle against the gusts once more . After another twenty minutes pistoning my legs along this blast furnace of a road , I see a group of motorbikers passing me on their way to the Maze District of Canyonlands . The dust from the motorbikes blows straight into my face , clogging my nose , my eyes , my tear ducts , even gluing itself to my teeth . I grimace at the grit pasted on my lips , lick my teeth clean , and press on , thinking about where those bikers would be headed . // I 've visited the Maze only once myself , for about half an hour , nearly ten years ago . When our Cataract Canyon rafting party pulled over in the afternoon to set up camp along the Colorado River at a beach called Spanish Bottom , I hiked a thousand feet up over the rim rock into a place known as the Doll 's House . **30;699;TOOLONG hoodoo rock formations towered above me as I scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally turned around to look back at the river , I jerked to a halt and sat on the nearest boulder with a view . It was the first time the features and formative processes of the desert had made me pause and absorb just how small and brave we are , we the human race . // Down behind the boats at Spanish Bottom , a furious river churned ; suddenly , I perceived in its auburn flow that it was , even at that exact moment , carving that very canyon from a thousand square miles of desert tablelands . From the Doll 's House , I had the unexpected impression that I was watching the ongoing birth of an entire landscape , as if I were standing on the rim of an exploding caldera . The vista held for me a feeling of the dawn of time , that primordial epoch before life when there was only desolate land . Like looking through a telescope into the Milky Way and wondering if we 're alone in the universe , it made me realize with the glaring clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how insignificant we are when compared with the forces of nature and the dimensions of space . Were my group to board those two rafts a mile in the distance and depart , I would be as cut off from human contact as a person could be . In fifteen to thirty days ' time , I would starve in a lonely death as I hiked the meanders back upriver to Moab , never again to see the sign or skin of another human . Yet beyond the paucity and the solitude of the surrounding desert , it was an exultant thought that peeled back the veneer of our self-important delusions . We are not grand because we are at the top of the food chain or because we can alter our environment  --  the environment will outlast us with its unfathomable forces and unyielding powers . But rather than be bound and defeated by our insignificance , we are bold because we exercise our will anyway , despite the ephemeral and delicate presence we have in this desert , on this planet , in this universe . I sat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened as the view from that bluff , I returned to camp and made extra-short work of dinner . // Riding down the road past the metal culvert that marks the dried-up source of the West Fork of Blue John Canyon , I pass through a signed intersection where a branch of the dirt road splits off toward Hanks- // ville , a small town an hour to the west at the gateway to Capitol Reef National Park . Hanksville is the closest settlement to the Robbers Roost and the Maze District , and home to the nearest landline public telephone in the region . Just a half mile farther , I pass a slanting grassy plain that was an airstrip until whatever minor catastrophe forced whoever was flying there to head back to more tenable ground . It 's an indication of how small planes and helicopters are typically the only efficient means of getting from here to there in this country . Some of the time , though , it 's not financially worth leaving here to get there , even if you can fly . Better just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to transect this part of the country with road grades , but they , too , retreated to the established towns of Green River and Moab . Today most of those Mormon trails have been abandoned and replaced by still barely passable roads whose access by vehicle is , ironically , more sparse than it was by horse or wagon a hundred years ago . Last night I drove fifty-seven miles down the only dirt road in the eastern half of two counties to arrive at my embarkation point  --  it was two and a half hours of washboard driving during which I did n't pass a single light or a house . Frontier ranchers , rustlers , uranium miners , and oil drillers each left a mark on this land but have folded their hands in deference to the stacked deck of desert livelihood . // Those seekers of prosperity were n't the first to cross the threshold into this country , only to abandon the region as a barren wasteland : Progressive waves of ancient communities came into being and vanished over the ages in the area 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drought or an incursion by hostile bands that made life in the high country and the deserts farther south seem more hospitable . But sometimes there are no defensible answers to explain the sudden evacuation of an entire culture from a particular place . Five thousand years ago , the people of Barrier Creek left their pictographs and petroglyphs at the Great Gallery and Alcove Gallery ; then they disappeared . Since they left no written record , why they departed is both a mystery and a springboard for the imagination . Looking at their paintings and standing in their homes , gardens , and trash heaps , I feel connected to the aboriginal pioneers who inhabited these canyons so long ago . // As I grind my way out onto the open mesa , the wind slaps at my face , and I find myself already looking forward to the final hike through Horseshoe Canyon , where I will finish my tour . I ca n't wait to get out of this demeaning wind . // To judge from what I 've seen on my ride , there are few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and the present . The Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) has graded the century-old horse trail and added scattered signposts , but even the ubiquitous fences that partition the rest of the West are noticeably absent . Perhaps it 's the lack of barbed wire that makes this place feel so terrifically remote . I spend a lot of time in out-of-the-way areas  --  two or three days a week in designated wildernesses , even through the winter  --  but most of them do n't feel half as isolated as this back road . As I consider this , abruptly , my solitude changes to loneliness and seems somehow more tenacious . While the region 's towns may have simmered since those raucous days when the Robbers Roost was earning its name , the outlying desert is still just as wild . // A mile past Burr Pass , my torturous ride into the thirty-mile-an-hour headwind finally comes to an end . I dismount and walk my bike over to a juniper tree and fasten a U-lock through the rear tire . I have little worry that anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dad says , " There 's no sense in tempting honest people . " I drop the U-lock 's keys into my left pocket and turn toward the main attraction , Blue John Canyon . I follow a deer path on an overland shortcut , listening to some of my favorite music on my CD player now that the wind is n't blowing so obnoxiously in my ears . After I 've hiked through some dunes of pulverized red sandstone , I come to a sandy gully and see that I 've found my way to the nascent canyon . " Good , I 'm on the right route , " I think , and then I notice two people walking out of view thirty yards downcanyon . I leap down the dune into the shallow wash , and once I 'm around the dune 's far corner , I spot the hikers , who look from this distance to be two young women . // " What are the odds ? " I think , surprised to find anyone else this far out in the desert . Having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shake that feeling of loneliness picked up out on the road , I pause to take off my headphones , then spur myself to catch up . They 're moving almost as quickly as I can manage without jogging , and it takes a minute before I can tell that I 'm making any distance on them at all . I 'd been fully expecting a solo descent in the Main Fork of Blue John Canyon , but meeting like-minded people in far-flung places is usually a fun addition to the experience for me , especially if they can keep a fast pace . In any case , I can hardly avoid them at this point . At another bend , they look back and see me but do n't wait up . Finally , I catch up with them but ca n't really pass them unless they stop , which they don't. // Realizing that we 're going to be hiking together for a while , I figure I should initiate a conversation . " Howdy , " I begin , " how 's it goin ' ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger in the backcountry . They answer with a pair of unadorned hi's. // Hoping for something a little more engaging , I try again . " I was n't expecting to see anyone in the canyon today . " // Even though it is a Saturday , this place is remote , and so obscure I could n't even tell it was here from the Robbers Roost dirt access road , despite my map that definitively shows the canyon 's presence . // " Yeah , you surprised us , sneaking up like that , " the brown-haired woman replies , but then she smiles . // " Oh , sorry . I was listening to my headphones , kind of wrapped up in my thoughts , " I explain . Returning the smile , I extend an introduction : " My name 's Aron. " // They relax noticeably and share their names  --  they are Megan , the brunette who spoke to me and who seems to be the more outgoing one of the pair , and Kristi . Megan 's shoulder-length hair whirls attractively around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue zip-neck long-sleeved shirt and blue track pants and carries a blue backpack  --  if I had to guess , I 'd say she likes the color blue . Kristi 's blond hair is pulled back in a ponytail that reveals the sunny freckles on her forehead and her deep grayish-blue eyes . Besides her clothes  --  a plain white short-sleeved T-shirt with blue shorts over black long underwear  --  I notice that Kristi has accessorized for the day , wearing small silver hoop earrings and dark sunglasses with faux tortoiseshell frames and a snakeskin-pattern retaining strap . Unusual to have earrings on in a canyon , but I 'm hardly dressed to kill , so I skip issuing a fashion citation . Both women are in their mid-twenties , and I learn in response to my first question that they both hail from Moab . I briefly work on memorizing their names , and which one is which , so I do n't goof it up later . // Megan does n't seem to mind joining me in conversation . She fires off a story about how she and Kristi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert for an hour before they found the start of the canyon . I say I think it is easier to navigate on a bike than in a vehicle because the landscape passes more slowly . // " Oh my God , if we 'd been on bikes , we 'd have dried up in the wind before we got here , " Megan cracks , and it serves to break the ice . // The canyon is still just a shallow arroyo  --  a dry sandy gulch  --  nestled between two sets of thirty-foot-tall sand dunes . Before the terrain becomes more technical , we ease into a friendly exchange , chatting about our lives in the polarized resort communities of Moab and Aspen . I learn that they , like me , work in the outdoor recreation industry . As logistics managers for Outward Bound , they outfit expeditions from the company 's supply warehouse in Moab . I tell them I 'm a sales and shop worker at the Ute Mountaineer , an outdoor gear store in Aspen . // There 's a mostly unspoken acknowledgment among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fiscally poor yet rich in experience  --  living the dream  --  than to be traditionally wealthy but live separate from one 's passions . There is an undercurrent of attitude among the high-country proletariat that to buy one 's way back into the experience of resort life is a shameful scarlet letter . Better to be the penniless local than the affluent visitor . ( But the locals depend on the visitors to survive , so the implied elitism is less than fair . ) We understand our mutual membership on the same side of the equation . // The same is true of our environmental sensibilities . We each hold Edward Abbey  --  combative conservationist ; anti-development , anti-tourism , and anti-mining essayist ; beer swiller ; militant ecoterrorist ; lover of the wilderness and women ( preferably wilderness women , though those are unfortunately rare )  --  as a sage of environmentalism . Remembering an oddball quote of his , I say how he delighted in taking things to the extreme . " I think there was an essay where he wrote , ' Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an environmentalist would be to shoot himself in the head . Otherwise he 's still contaminating the place by his mere presence . ' That 's a paraphrase , but it 's effectively what he said . " // " That 's kind of morbid , " Megan replies , putting on a face of sham guilt for not shooting herself . // Moving on from Ed Abbey , we discover that we 're each experienced in slot canyoneering . Kristi asks me what my favorite slot canyon is , and without hesitation , I recount my experience in Neon Canyon , an unofficially named branch of the Escalante River system in south-central Utah . I wax poetic about its five rappels , the keeper pothole ( a deep , steep , and smooth-walled hole in the canyon floor that will " keep " you there if you do n't have a partner to boost out first ) , and the Golden Cathedral : a bizarre rappel through a sandstone tunnel in the roof of an alcove the size of Saint Peter 's that leaves you hanging free from the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool of water and then swim to the shore . // " It 's phenomenal , you have to go , " I conclude . // Kristi tells me about her favorite slot , which is just across the dirt road from the Granary Spring Trailhead . It 's one of the upper forks of the Robbers Roost drainage , nicknamed " Mindbender " by her Outward Bound friends . She describes a passage in that slot where you traverse the canyon wedged between the walls some fifteen feet off the ground , the V-shaped slot tapering to a few inches wide at your feet , and even narrower below that . // I mentally add that one to my to-do list . // A few minutes later , just before noon , we arrive at a steep , smooth slide down a rock face , which heralds the first slot and the deeper , narrower sections that have drawn us to Blue John Canyon . I slide fifteen feet down the rock embankment , skidding on the soles of my sneakers , leaving a pair of black streaks on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the wall . Hearing the noise as she comes around the corner , Kristi sees me squatting in the dirt and assumes I have fallen . " Oh my gosh , are you OK ? " she asks . // " Oh yeah , I 'm fine . I did that on purpose , " I tell her in earnest , as the skid truly had been intentional . I catch her glance , a good-natured shot that tells me she believes me but thinks I 'm silly for not finding an easier way down . I look around and , seeing an obviously less risky access route that would have avoided the slide , I feel slightly foolish . // Five minutes later , we come to the first section of difficult downclimbing , a steep descent where it 's best to turn in and face the rock , reversing moves that one would usually use for climbing up . I go down first , then swing my backpack around to retrieve my video camera and tape Megan and Kristi . Kristi pulls a fifteen-foot-long piece of red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads it through a metal ring that previous canyoneering parties have suspended on another loop of webbing tied around a rock . The rock is securely wedged in a depression behind the lip of the drop-off , and the webbing system easily holds a person 's weight . Grasping the webbing , Megan backs herself down over the drop-off . She has to maneuver around an overhanging chockstone  --  a boulder suspended between the walls of the canyon  --  that blocks an otherwise easy scramble down into the deepening slot . Once Megan is down , Kristi follows skittishly , as she does n't completely trust the webbing system . After she 's down , I climb back up to retrieve Kristi 's webbing . // We walk thirty feet and come to another drop-off . The walls are much closer now , only two to three feet apart . Megan throws her backpack over the drop before shimmying down between the walls , while Kristi takes a few pictures . I watch Megan descend and help her by pointing out the best handholds and footholds . When Megan is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack is soaking wet . It turns out her hydration-system hose lost its nozzle when she tossed the pack over the ledge , and was leaking water into the sand . She quickly finds the blue plastic nozzle and stops the water 's hemorrhage , saving her from having to return to the trailhead . While it 's not a big deal that her pack is wet , she has lost precious water . I descend last , my pack on my back and my delicate cameras causing // me to get stuck briefly between the walls at several constrictions . Squirming my way over small chockstones , I stem my body across the gap between the walls to follow the plunging canyon floor . There is a log wedged in the slot at one point , and I use it like a ladder on a smooth section of the skinny-people-only descent . // While the day up above the rim rock is getting warmer , the air down in the canyon becomes cooler as we enter a four-hundred-yard-long section of the canyon where the walls are over two hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of this slot . We pick up some raven 's feathers , stick them in our hats , and pause for photographs . // A half mile later , several side canyons drop into the Main Fork where we are walking , as the walls open up to reveal the sky and a more distant perspective of the cliffs downcanyon . In the sun once again , we stop to share two of my melting chocolate bars . Kristi offers some to Megan , who declines , and Kristi says , " I really ca n't eat all this chocolate by myself ... Never mind , yes I can , " and we laugh together . // We come to an uncertain consensus that this last significant tributary off to the left of the Main Fork is the West Fork , which means it 's the turnoff for Kristi and Megan to finish their circuit back to the main dirt road about four miles away . We get hung up on saying our goodbyes when Kristi suggests , " Come on , Aron , hike out with us  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have a beer . " // I 'm dedicated to finishing my planned tour , so I counter , " How about this ?  --  you guys have your harnesses , I have a rope  --  you should come with me down through the lower slot and do the Big Drop rappel . We can hike out ... see the Great Gallery ... I 'll give you a lift back to your truck . " // " How far is it ? " asks Megan. // " Another eight miles or so , I think . " // " What ? You wo n't get out before dark ! Come on , come with us. " // " I really have my heart set on doing the rappel and seeing the petroglyphs . But I 'll come around to the Granary Spring Trailhead to meet you when I 'm done . " // This they agree to . We sit and look at the maps one more time , confirming our location on the Blue John map from the canyoneering guidebook we 'd each used to find this remote slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiking Guide to the Colorado Plateau , there are over a hundred canyons described , each with its own hand-sketched map . Drawn by Kelsey from his personal experience in each canyon , the technical maps and route descriptions are works of art . With cross sections of tricky slots , identifications of hard-to-find petroglyphs and artifact sites , and details of required rappelling equipment , anchor points , and deep-water holes , the book offers enough information for you to sleuth your way through a decision or figure out where you are , but not a single item extra . After we put away the maps , we stand up , and Kristi says , " That picture in the book makes those paintings look like ghosts ; they 're kind of spooky . What kind of energy do you think you 'll find at the Gallery ? " // " Hmm . " I pause to consider her question . " I du n no . I 've felt pretty connected looking at petroglyphs before ; it 's a good feeling . I 'm excited to see them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't come with us ? " But I 'm as set on my choice as they are on theirs . // A few minutes before they go , we solidify our plan to meet up around dusk at their campsite back by Granary Spring . There 's going to be a Scooby party tonight of some friends of friends of mine from Aspen , about fifty miles away , just north of Goblin Valley State Park , and we agree to caravan there together . Most groups use paper plates as improvised road signs to an out-of-the-way rendezvous site ; my friends have a large stuffed Scooby-Doo to designate the turnoff . After what I 'll have completed  --  an all-day adventure tour , fifteen miles of mountain biking and fifteen miles of canyoneering  --  I 'll have earned a little relaxation and hopefully a cold beer . It will be good to see these two lovely ladies of the desert again so soon , too . We seal the deal by adding a short hike of Little Wild Horse Canyon , a nontechnical slot in Goblin Valley , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part ways at two P.M. with smiles and waves . // * * * // Alone once again , I walk downcanyon , continuing on my itinerary . Along the way , I think through the remainder of my vacation time . Now that I have a solid plan for Sunday to hike Little Wild Horse , I speculate that I 'll get back to Moab around seven o'clock that evening . I 'll have just enough time to get my gear and food and water prepared for my bike ride on the White Rim in Canyonlands National Park and catch a nap before starting around midnight . By doing the first thirty miles of the White Rim by headlamp and starlight , I should be able to finish the 108-mile ride late Monday afternoon , in time for a house party my roommates and I have planned for Monday night . // Without warning , my feet stumble in a pile of loose pebbles deposited from the last flash flood , and I swing my arms out to catch my balance . Instantly , my full attention returns to Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the band at the back of my blue ball cap , and I can see its shadow in the sand . It looks goofy  --  I stop in the open canyon and take a picture of my shadow with the feather . Without breaking stride , I unclip my pack 's waist belt and chest strap , flip my pack around to my chest , and root around inside the mesh outer pouch until I can push play on my portable CD player . Audience cheers give way to a slow lilting guitar intro and then soft lyrics : // How is it I never see / The waves that bring her words to me ? // I 'm listening to the second set of the February 15 Phish show that I attended three months ago in Las Vegas .

Feeling aligned in my body and head rejuvenates my spirit . Sometimes , when I get high-minded about it , I think solo hiking is my own method of attaining a transcendental state , a kind of walking meditation . I do n't get there when I sit and try to meditate , om-style ; it happens only when I 'm walking by myself . Unfortunately , as soon as I recognize that I 'm having such a moment , the feeling ebbs , thoughts return , the transcendence evaporates . I work hard to set myself up for that fleeting sense of being wholly pleased , but my judgments about the feeling displace the feeling itself . Although it 's ephemeral , the general well-being that accompanies such a moment will boost my temperament for hours or even days . // It 's two-fifteen P.M. , and in the balance of sunshine and thin stratus layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the open section of the canyon , the temperature is about happy  --  is one of the reasons why I go to the lengths I do to have some focused time to myself .

Sometimes , when I get high-minded about it , I think solo hiking is my own method of attaining a transcendental state , a kind of walking meditation . I do n't get there when I sit and try to meditate , om-style ; it happens only when I 'm walking by myself . Unfortunately , as soon as I recognize that I 'm having such a moment , the feeling ebbs , thoughts return , the transcendence evaporates . I work hard to set myself up for that fleeting sense of being wholly pleased , but my judgments about the feeling displace the feeling itself . Although it 's ephemeral , the general well-being that accompanies such a moment will boost my temperament for hours or even days . // It 's two-fifteen P.M. , and in the balance of sunshine and thin stratus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the open section of the canyon , the temperature is about fifteen degrees warmer than it was at the bottom of the deep slot . There are a few full-fledged cumulus clouds listing like lost clipper ships , but no shade . I come upon a wide yellow arroyo entering from the right , and I check my map . This is the East Fork . Kristi and Megan definitely chose the correct fork to return . The choice seemed obvious then , but even obvious decisions need to be double-checked in the backcountry . Navigating in a deep canyon can be deceptively complex . Occasionally , I 'm tempted to think that there 's nothing to it ; I just keep going straight . With three-hundred-foot walls fencing me in five feet to either side , I ca n't really lose the bottom of the canyon , like I can lose the route on a mountainside . But I 've gotten disoriented before . // A forty-mile solo trip in Paria Canyon comes to mind . There was a stretch about a third of the way into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hiked roughly five miles downstream before I found a landmark that indicated an exact position on my map . This became critical , because I needed to find the exit trail before night fell . When you 're looking for an entry/exit , sometimes being fifty yards off-route can hide the way . So now I pay close attention to my map . When I 'm navigating well in the canyons , I check my map even more frequently than when I 'm on a mountain , maybe every two hundred yards . // If we could see the many waves / That float through clouds and sunken caves / She 'd sense at least the words that sought her / On the wind and underwater . // The song blends into something atonally sweet but unattended as I pass another shallow wash coming in from the right . On the map , the arroyo seems to correspond with what Kelsey has named Little East Fork , dropping from a higher tableland he labels Goat Park . // The elevated benches and rolling juniper-covered highlands of Goat Park to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sloping capstone of interlayered purple , red , and brown siltstone , limestone , and shale strata deposit . The capstone is more resistant to erosion than the older wind-deposited Navajo sandstone that forms the smooth ruddy-hued cliffs of the scenic slot canyons . In places , this differential erosion creates hoodoos , freestanding rock towers and tepees , and tall dunes of colored stone that dot the upper reaches of the canyon 's cliffs . The juxtaposed textures , colors , and shapes of the Carmel and Navajo rock layers reflect the polarized landscapes that formed them  --  the early Jurassic Period sea and the late Triassic Period desert . Settling out from a great sea , the Carmel Formation sediments look like solidified mud that dried up last month . On the other hand , cross-bedded patterns in the Navajo sandstone reveal its ancestry from shifting sand dunes : One fifteen-foot-high band in the cliffs displays inlaid lines slanting to the right ; the next band 's layers slant to the left ; and above that , the stratification lines lie perfectly horizontal . Over the eons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind blowing across an ancient Sahara-like desert , devoid of vegetation . Depending if the sandstone shapes left behind are beat upon more by wind or by water , they look like either rough-hewn sand domes or polished cliffs . All this beauty keeps a smile on my face . // I estimate that the distance I have left to cover is about a half mile until I reach the narrow slot above the sixty-five-foot-high Big Drop rappel . This two-hundred-yard-long slot marks the midpoint of my descent in Blue John and Horseshoe canyons . I 've come about seven miles from where I left my bike , and I have about eight miles to get to my truck . Once I reach the narrow slot , there will be some short sections of downclimbing , maneuvering over and under a series of chockstones , then 125 yards of very tight slot , some of it only eigh- // teen inches wide , to get to the platform where two bolt-and-hanger sets provide an anchor for the rappel . Rappel bolts are typically three-inch-long , **27;731;TOOLONG expansion bolts set in either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal bent into an L-shape called a hanger . The hangers have two holes , one in the flush section for the bolt to hold it to the wall , and one in the bent lip that can be clipped by a carabiner , a screw-gate chain link , or threaded with a length of webbing . When the bolt is properly installed in solid rock , you can load several thousand pounds on it without concern , but in slot canyons , the rock often rots around the bolt shaft due to frequent flooding events . It 's reassuring when there are two bolt/hangers that can be used in tandem , in case one unexpectedly fails . // I have my climbing rope , harness , belay device , and webbing with me for the rappel , and I have my headlamp along to search crevices for snakes before putting my hands in them . I 'm already thinking ahead to the hike after the rappel , especially the Great Gallery . Kelsey 's guidebook calls it the best pictograph panel on the Colorado Plateau  --  and the Barrier Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared "  --  which has piqued my interest since I read about it on my drive to Utah two days ago . // Gold in my hair / In a country pool / Standing and waving / The rain , wind on the runway . // I 'm caught up in another song and barely notice the canyon walls closing in , forming the beginning of the slot , this one more like a back alley between a couple of self-storage warehouses than the skyscrapers of the upper slot . An anthemic guitar riff accompanies me as my stride turns into more of a strut and I pump my right fist in the air . Then I reach the first drop-off in the floor of the canyon , a dryfall . Were there water in the canyon , this would be a waterfall . A harder layer embedded in the sandstone has proved more resistant to erosion by the floods , and this dark conglomerate forms the lip at the drop . From the ledge where I 'm standing to the continuing canyon bottom is about ten feet . About twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls . It would provide an easier descent path if I could get to it , but it seems more difficult to access via the shallow and sloping conglomerate shelf on my right than by the ten-foot drop to the canyon floor over the lip in front of me. // I use a few good in-cut handholds on my left to lower myself around the overhang , gripping the sandstone huecos  --  water-hollowed holes in the wall  --  like jug handles . At full extension , my legs dangle two , maybe three feet off the floor . I let go and drop off the dryfall , landing in a sandy concavity carved deeper than the surrounding floor by the impact of floodwaters dropping over the lip . My feet hit the dried mud , which cracks and crumbles like plaster ; I sink up to my shoe tops in the powdery platelets . It 's not a difficult maneuver , but I could n't climb directly up the drop-off from below . I 'm committed to my course ; there 's no going back . // A new song starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the canyon deepens to thirty feet below the tops of the sand domes overhead . // I fear I never told you the story of the ghost / That I once knew and talked to , of whom I never boast . // The pale sky is still visible above this ten-foot-wide gash in the earth 's surface . In my path are two van-sized chockstones a hundred feet apart . One is just a foot off the sandy canyon bottom ; the next sits square on the corridor floor . I scramble over both blockages . The canyon narrows to four feet wide , with undulating and twisting walls that lead me to the left then back to the right , through a straight passage , then left and right again , all the while deepening . // Colossal flood action has scooped out beach balls of rock from the sandstone walls and wedged logs thirty feet overhead . Slot canyons are the last place you want to be during a desert thunderstorm . The sky directly above the canyon might be clear , but a cloudburst in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drown unwary canyoneers . In a flood , the rain falls faster than the ground can absorb it . In the eastern United States , it might take the ground days or weeks to reach saturation and for rivers to flood after many inches or even feet of rain . In the desert , the hard sunbaked earth acts like fired clay-tile shingles , and a flood can start from a fraction of an inch of rain that might come in five minutes from a single storm cloud . Chased off the impermeable hardscrabble , the downpour creates a surging deluge . Runoff gathers from converging drainages and quickly becomes a foot of water in a forty-foot-wide section of the canyon . That same amount of water becomes a catastrophic torrent in a confined space . Where the walls narrow to four feet , the flood turns into a ten-foot-high chaos of churning mud and debris that moves boulders , sculpts canyons , lodges drift material in constrictions , and kills anything that ca n't climb to safety . // In this meandering section of the narrow canyon , silt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a height of twelve feet above the beachlike floor , and decades of scour marks overlay the rosy and purplish striations of exposed rock . The undulating walls distort the flat lines of the strata and grab my attention in one spot where the opposing walls dive in front of each other at a double-hairpin meander . I stop to take a few photographs . I note that the time stamp is a minute slow compared to my watch : The digital camera 's screen says it is 2:41 P.M. , Saturday afternoon , April 26 , 2003. // I bob my head to the music as I walk another twenty yards and come to a series of three chockstones and scramble over them . Then I see another five chockstones , all the size of large refrigerators , wedged at varying heights off the canyon floor like a boulder gauntlet . It 's unusual to see so many chockstones lined up in such evenly spaced proximity . With two feet of clearance under the first suspended chockstone , I have to crawl under it on my belly  --  the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canyon  --  but there is no alternative . The next chockstone is wedged a little higher off the ground . I stand and brush myself off , then squat and duck to pass under . A crawl on all fours and two more squat-and-duck maneuvers , and I 've passed the remaining chockstones . The defile is over sixty feet deep at this point , having dropped fifty feet below the sand domes in two hundred feet of linear distance . // I come to another drop-off . This one is maybe eleven or twelve feet high , a foot higher and of a different geometry than the overhang I descended ten minutes ago . Another refrigerator chockstone is wedged between the walls , ten feet downstream from and at the same height as the ledge . It gives the space below the drop-off the claustrophobic feel of a short tunnel . Instead of the walls widening after the drop-off , or opening into a bowl at the bottom of the canyon , here the slot narrows to a consistent three feet across at the lip of the drop-off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes in narrow passages like this one , it 's possible for me to stem my body across the slot , with my feet and back pushing out in opposite directions against the walls . Controlling this counterpressure by switching my hands and feet on the opposing walls , I can move up or down the shoulder-width crevice fairly easily as long as the friction contact stays solid between the walls and my hands , feet , and back . This technique is known as stemming or chimneying ; you can imagine using it to climb up the inside of a chimney . // Just below the ledge where I 'm standing is a chockstone the size of a large bus tire , stuck fast in the channel between the walls , a few feet out from the lip . If I can step onto it , then I 'll have a nine-foot height to descend , less than that of the first overhang . I 'll dangle off the chockstone , then take a short fall onto the rounded rocks piled on the canyon floor . Stemming across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot and one hand on each of the walls , I traverse out to the chockstone . I press my back against the south wall and lock my left knee , which pushes my foot tight against the north wall . With my right foot , I kick at the boulder to test how stuck it is . It 's jammed tightly enough to hold my weight . I lower myself from the chimneying position and step onto the chockstone . It supports me but teeters slightly . After confirming that I do n't want to chimney down from the chockstone 's height , I squat and grip the rear of the lodged boulder , turning to face back upcanyon . Sliding my belly over the front edge , I can lower myself and hang from my fully extended arms , akin to climbing down from the roof of a house . // As I dangle , I feel the stone respond to my adjusting grip with a scraping quake as my body 's weight applies enough torque to disturb it from its position . Instantly , I know this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotating boulder to land on the round rocks below . When I look up , the backlit chockstone falling toward my head consumes the sky . Fear shoots my hands over my head . I ca n't move backward or I 'll fall over a small ledge . My only hope is to push off the falling rock and get my head out of its way . // The next three seconds play out at a tenth of their normal speed . Time dilates , as if I 'm dreaming , and my reactions decelerate . In slow motion : The rock smashes my left hand against the south wall ; my eyes register the collision , and I yank my left arm back as the rock ricochets ; the boulder then crushes my right hand and ensnares my right arm at the wrist , palm in , thumb up , fingers extended ; the rock slides another foot down the wall with my arm in tow , tearing the skin off the lateral side of my forearm . Then silence . // My disbelief paralyzes me temporarily as I stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small gap between the fallen boulder and the canyon wall . Within moments , my nervous system 's pain response overcomes the initial shock . Good Christ , my hand . The flaring agony throws me into a panic . I grimace and growl a sharp " Fuck ! " My mind commands my body , " Get your hand out of there ! " I yank my arm three times in a naive attempt to pull it out . But I 'm stuck . // Anxiety has my brain tweaking ; searing-hot pain shoots from my wrist up my arm . I 'm frantic , and I cry out , " Oh shit , oh shit , oh shit ! " My desperate brain conjures up a probably apocryphal story in which an adrenaline-stoked mom lifts an overturned car to free her baby . I 'd give it even odds that it 's made up , but I do know for certain that right now , while my body 's chemicals are raging at full flood , is the best chance I 'll have to free myself with brute force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , pushing with my left hand , lifting with my knees pressed under the rock . I get good leverage with the aid of a twelve-inch shelf in front of my feet . Standing on that , I brace my thighs under the boulder and thrust upward repeatedly , grunting , " Come on ... move ! " Nothing . // I rest , and then I surge again against the rock . Again nothing . I replant my feet . Feeling around for a better grip on the bottom of the chockstone , I reposition my upturned left hand on a handle of rock , take a deep breath , and slam into the boulder , harder than any of my previous attempts . " Yeearrgg ... unnnhhh , " the exertion forces the air from my lungs , all but masking the quiet , hollow sound of the boulder tottering . The stone 's movement is imperceptible ; all I get is a spike in the already extravagant pain , and I gasp , " Ow ! Fuck ! " // I 've shifted the boulder a fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist a bit more . This thing weighs a lot more than I do  --  it 's a testament to how amped I am that I moved it at all  --  and now all I want is to move it back . I get into position again , pulling with my left hand on top of the stone , and budge the rock back ever so slightly , reversing what I just did . The pain eases a little . In the process , I 've lacerated and bruised the skin over my left quadriceps above the knee . I 'm sweating hard . With my left hand , I lift my right shirtsleeve off my shoulder and wipe my forehead . My chest heaves . I need a drink , but when I suck on my hydration-system hose , I find my water reservoir is empty . // I have a liter of water in a Lexan bottle in my backpack , but it takes me a few seconds to realize I wo n't be able to sling my pack off my right arm . I remove my camera from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have my left arm free of the pack strap , I expand the right strap , tuck my head inside the loop , and pull the strap over my left shoulder so it encompasses my torso . The weight of the rappelling equipment , video camera , and water bottle tugs the pack down to my feet , and then I step out of the strap loop . Extracting the dark gray water bottle from the bottom of my pack , I unscrew the top , and before I realize the significance of what I 'm doing , I gulp three large mouthfuls of water and halt to pant for breath . Then it hits me : In five seconds , I 've guzzled a third of my entire remaining water supply . // " Oh , damn , dude , cap that and put it away . No more water . " I screw down the lid tight , drop the bottle into the pack resting at my knees , and take three deep breaths . // " OK , time to relax . The adrenaline 's not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this over , see what we got . " Amazingly , it 's been half an hour since the accident . The decision to get objective with my situation and stop rushing from one brutish attempt to the next allows my energy to settle down . This is n't going to be over quickly , so I need to start thinking . To do that , I need to be calm . // The first thing I decide to do is examine the area where the boulder has my wrist pinned . Gravity and friction have wedged the chockstone , now suspended about four feet above the canyon floor , into a new set of constriction points . At three spots , the opposing walls secure the rock . On the downcanyon side of the boulder , my hand and wrist form a fourth support where they are caught in the grip of this horrific handshake . I think , " My hand is n't just stuck in there , it 's actually holding this boulder off the wall . Oh , man , I 'm fucked. " // I reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is visible along the north wall of the canyon . Poking down into the small gap above the catch point , I touch my thumb , which is already a sickly gray color . It 's cocked sideways in the space and looks terribly unnatural . I straighten my thumb with the fore and middle fingers of my left hand . There is no feeling in any part of my right hand at all . I accept this with a sense of detachment , as if I 'm diagnosing someone else 's problem . This clinical objectivity calms me . Without sensation , it does n't seem as much my hand  --  if it were my hand , I could feel it when I touched it . The farthest part of my arm I can feel is my wrist , where the boulder is pinning it . Judging by appearances , the lack of any bone-splitting noises during the accident , and how it all feels to my left hand , I probably do n't have any broken bones . From the nature of the accident , though , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all I know , something could be broken in the middle of my hand . Either way , not good . // Investigating the underside of the boulder , I can touch the little finger on my right hand and feel its position with my left hand . It 's twisted up inside my palm , in a partial fist ; my muscles seem to be in a state of forced contraction . I ca n't relax my hand or extend any of my fingers . I try to wiggle each one independently . There 's no movement whatsoever . I try flexing my muscles to make a tighter fist , but there is n't even the slightest twitch .
