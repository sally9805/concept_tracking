Part I Grandpa Fairfax had willed a big brass key to Barbara-a big brass key to seven mysterious keyholes in the dilapidated Fairfax mansion on Pine Point . The most important of these was the seventh keyhole , according to the will , and his granddaughter must find them all herself . Barbara had a hard time evading Kit and Kat , the inquisitive Carroll twins , when she started on her search . She thought at first that she had succeeded , but just as she found the first keyhole and was about to open it , she turned and saw them , hanging over one of the open window ledges and grinning teasingly at her . Part II " Go away from here , straight at once ! " she exclaimed in an indignant voice . " You must not come here and bother me while I 'm busy . " She stood waiting for them to leave , the key still in her hand and conscious that they were staring at it with all their eyes . " What 's that old key for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the windowsill . They were certainly very infuriating . And Barbara was becoming more indignant every minute . " I ca n't tell you , " she retorted , " and I 'm not going to anyway . If you do n't get off the windowsill this minute , I 'm going to shut the window down-right on your heads ! " This was a terrible threat and Barbara knew it . She also knew that she would never in the world do such a thing , but she was desperate and something desperate had to be done or said . Here at her fingertips was the secret waiting to be solved and those children persisted in getting in the way ! The twins , however , reacted with unexpected seriousness . Slowly and watchfully they unhinged themselves from the windowsill , and , with dragging footsteps , disappeared from the veranda . Though Barbara was relieved at their departure , she was left with the uneasy feeling that she had not been very wise , and that the Carroll twins in an unfriendly mood were somewhat to be dreaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot them and returned joyfully to her quest . The big key fitted perfectly into the lock of the drawer in the carpenter 's bench and smoothly turned in its socket . Grandpa Fairfax was certainly a good locksmith . Barbara had time to think of that , even as she jerked open the drawer and peered within . If this compartment had once contained nails and tools , there was nothing of that sort in it now On the contrary , it was quite empty , save for a sheet of paper folded and addressed on one side in Grandpa Fairfax 's small , shaky handwriting to Barbara . She laid down the key and opened it wonderingly , standing to read it right where she was : Dear Granddaughter : Photograph // If you have the energy and interest to persist in the quest on which I have started you , I think you will not regret it . You will think it a very strange thing and so will everyone else , I suppose . But then I am a strange old man and probably I do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years and have realized that you are a young girl with a very good mind  --  the kind of mind that likes to know about things . The kind with interest enough to think and ask questions and put together the things you find out till you 've satisfied your curiosity . That is a very fine kind of mind to have and will get you somewhere in this world someday , if you keep up the good work . All my life 1 have loved locks and keys , in which I have been like " Louis the Locksmith . " Perhaps , if I had tended more to other things , I might have been more of a success in this world . At any rate , I have had a happy life , after my fashion , and now I am leaving to you the key to the same kind of happiness , if you care to avail yourself of it . You wo n't understand what all this means till you reach the seventh keyhole . When you do , turn back and read this letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this quest . The keyholes are all in plain sight and plainly numbered . If you search in the proper way and use your reason a bit , you will have no difficulty in locating them . And now I will close by saying that I had a very good time planning this adventure for you . With much love to you , Barbara , I am , Your affectionate GRANDPA FAIRFAX Barbara read the letter over three times before she got the real meaning of it . Then she sat down on the nearest chair to think it all over . That letter was so like Grandpa Fairfax . She remembered now how he would never answer a question of hers if he could possibly make her guess or reason out the answer herself . But what could it be that he had so carefully hidden away behind the seven keyholes , and where was the seventh keyhole ? And where were all the rest ? She started up to continue the search for the second , when she suddenly realized , by the appearance of the sun , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized further that she had promised her Aunt Lucreech that she would be on hand to shell several quarts of peas for supper that night and would have to hurry straight home if they were to be done in time . So , with a reluctant sigh , she went about and closed all the windows and doors , and slipped the now precious big brass key into her sweater pocket . Quickly she scampered back through the pine woods to Mrs. Bentley 's boarding house , feeling that at least she had accomplished something quite important that day . Photograph // As she had supposed , she found herself not on speaking terms with the twins that night . They ignored her at supper , and afterwards wandered off by themselves on some mysterious affair from which she was pointedly left out . She felt rather lonely for a while , but consoled herself by thinking over her afternoon 's adventure and planning where she would hunt for the second keyhole the next day . Much to her relief , she discovered that the twins ' mother intended to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep them there until evening . Very kindly Mrs. Carroll invited her to come along , too , but , much to everyone 's astonishment , Barbara politely refused , saying she had some work that must be done that day and could n't wait . Very wisely she saw them off first before she scurried pell-melt through the woods to the old house which seemed bursting with secrets for her . But the search that day was not destined to be as easy as the former one had been . Evidently Grandpa Fairfax had not intended to make it too easy for her . She had decided , before beginning , that it would be wise to conduct the search in a systematic way , thoroughly exhausting the possibilities of one room or location before moving on to another . And as she had begun on the living room , she thought that she would finish with that first and move on to the one across the hall only when there seemed nothing more to be discovered where she was . So she entered the living room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting in the sweet , warm air . The day was extremely hot and there were highpiled thunderclouds rising slowly out of the west , but Barbara had not time to notice this as she hurried about her task . Every bit of furniture in the cluttered and dusty old room she examined with the greatest care , but though there were a number of keyholes in various drawers and doors , not one held the key or seemed related to it in the slightest way . After she had gone over them all twice , with no result , she sat down once more on the carpenter 's bench and read Grandpa Fairfax 's letter again . She noted particularly the line where he had said that she had a good mind , a mind that liked to know things and was able to reason things out . " But I 'm afraid he would n't think so if he could see me now ! " she ruefully said aloud . " I ca n't seem to figure out where that second keyhole can be . " And again she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if for inspiration . As she glanced at the cramped , shaky writing , she could almost see Grandpa Fairfax as he wrote it ; stroking his long white beard with one hand as he sat , laboriously penning it at his old secretary desk across the room . She had seen him sit there many times , his spectacles down to the end of his nose , where they always seemed to slide when he was busy . Photograph // Then her eyes unconsciously traveled over to the old secretary desk-and then she had a brand-new inspiration . That desk was somehow very closely associated with Grandpa Fairfaxalmost as much so as the carpenter bench . Had she given it all the attention it deserved ? She decided she had n't and sprang across the room to it with renewed hope . It was , like everything else , very rickety and out of repair . One of the prettily curved legs was broken clear off and its place was supplied by two or three bricks piled together . Several brass knobs on the drawers were missing and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above the desk part were glass doors with curiously-shaped panes , the glass in several of which was broken . Barbara pulled out all the drawers and threw open the glass doors , but , save for Grandpa 's rusty pens and some blotting paper , the drawers were empty . She was about to slam the glass doors in disgust at the uselessness of this hunt , when her eye caught the gleam of brass on the side , well up beyond her reach . Seizing a chair , she climbed up for a closer view . Yes , sure enough , there was a diamond-shaped brass keyhole like the one on the bench , and close beside it a paper , written on which was a tiny figure " 2 . " This time Barbara did not shout , but she gave a happy little chuckle to think that she had succeeded again . Before she could turn to get the key , however , a terrific clap of thunder startled her so that she all but fell off the wooden chair . And at the same moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room in a dim twilight . Photograph // <p>
