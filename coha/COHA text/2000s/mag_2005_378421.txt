The great thing about being an obscure novelist is that it does n't matter what you write . " I could do pretty much whatever I wanted , " Michael Cunningham remembers fondly , " because nobody was likely to pay attention . " That was before Cunningham wrote The Hours , his moving reimagination of the novel Mrs. Dalloway and the life of its author , Virginia Woolf . The book won a Pulitzer . Nicole Kidman got an Oscar for the movie . Just like that , Cunningham 's precious obscurity was gone . " It 's harder to feel the necessary degree of recklessness when people are paying attention , " he says . " You have to be willing to fail . " <P> If his new book is any indication , Cunningham , 52 , is still willing to fail , and in the best possible way . Specimen Days ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ; 308 pages ) is divided into three parts , all set in New York City but each in a different era : the Industrial Revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three parts are written in three different literary genres and feature the same three characters . Walt Whitman also makes a cameo . Oh , and there 's a 5-ft. - tall , talking alien lizard woman . Recklessness : check . <P> Cunningham wants to be clear up front about the whole Whitman thing . " That came in later , " he says , over a double cappuccino at a Greenwich Village cafe . " I suspect it will look to some people like I thought , ' Virginia Woolf was a gold mine . I might as well try to cash in on Whitman as well . ' " The poet appears in person only in the book 's first part , a grim , oddly lyrical look at the lives of poor factory workers trapped in the filth and squalor of 19th century Manhattan . " Who was striding through all that but Mr. Walt Whitman ? " Cunningham says . " ' I sing the body electric ! ' The great embracer of all things , at a time when there was conspicuously little to embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arch-serious Hours will be surprised to find themselves in a jittery , edgy , very contemporary mystery story about urban terrorism . And then , in another sharp turn , the third part takes us to a future Manhattan populated by lifelike androids and lizard-like aliens , refugees from another planet . ( That section also features Cunningham 's first-ever car chase . ) What holds the disparate components of Specimen Days together is Cunningham 's intense focus on New York City as a crucible in which we 're forced to confront the radically foreign-even alien-realities of death , technology , urban life and each other . Whitman could embrace those realities-this is the guy who wrote , " I am large , I contain multitudes . " The rest of us can only hope to eke out an uneasy daily truce with them . <P> And lizards came into this how ? " I wrote that last section in a farmhouse in Tuscany , " Cunningham says . " And every morning the loveliest little greenish-purple lizard would dart back and forth . She had exactly that aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What does it feel like for a Pulitzer winner to put words in the mouth of a lizard ? " Dizzying and odd-but that 's as it should be , " he says . " I just have the very vaguest stirrings of what I want to write next-and again , it 's something I ca n't possibly do . " - By Lev Grossman
