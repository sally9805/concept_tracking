O BROTHER , WHAT ART THOU DOING IN ALLEN 'S PANTS ? <P> The Philadelphia 76ers star guard and hopeful hip-hop artist ALLEN IVERSON leads the league in steals per game , but it seems he had some Sixers competition . Last week it was revealed that John Croce , the 76ers ' **25;12999;TOOLONG coach and younger brother of team co-owner Pat Croce , had resigned from the team in January after a locker-room videotape showed him executing a dunk in Iverson 's pants pockets for spare cash . ( Iverson was not in the pants at the time . ) Video cameras had been installed after players complained of missing cash . " I felt sick , physically sick , " said the elder Croce upon viewing the tape ; he told his brother to resign or be fired . John Croce did resign , citing pursuit of a new job , and a forgiving Iverson did n't press charges . Neither did the Sixers organization , though Pat Croce says he has n't spoken to his brother since January . Iverson  --  also the league 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's hope John Croce 's final score was n't on payday . <P> Sophie 's Choice <P> Once upon a time , there was an overly ambitious p.r . exec named SOPHIE WESSEX ( alias Sophie Rhys-Jones , alias Countess of Wessex , a.k.a. wife of Prince Edward ) . One evening she met a handsome Arab , whom the Countess charmed so he would live happily ever after as her client . Alas for her ! Her future intended ( client ) was actually white-robed undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood , hired by the ruthless press baron Rupert Murdoch to tape their talk . The villain offered Sophie a choice : have a deeply personal chat with the News of the World , and the tapes would be hers . Or else . And so it was done . But alack ! A Murdoch rival , the Mail on Sunday , printed " excerpts " overheard by bitter Wessex employees  --  including Sophie allegedly calling Cherie Blair , the Prime Minister 's wife , " absolutely horrid horrid horrid , " and boasting about her likeness to Princess Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Beware the wolf in sheik 's clothing . <P> UNEASY LIES THE HAIRSTYLE <P> JENNIFER ANISTON fiercely despised being defined by her hairdo , so she impulsively chopped it into a bob not long after she married Brad Pitt . " I did it mainly to relieve me of the bondage of self , " she tells May 's Vanity Fair , sounding very Naomi Wolf . Umpteen fashion magazines raved about it . But it turns out she hates this new look . No , wait . HATES it . Truth be told , as a top British hairdresser noted , it 's less than flattering to Aniston 's long chin . " It 's just not me . I hide behind my hair , " she says . " It 's my shield . " Other famous faces  --  KATE MOSS , CHRISTY TURLINGTON , left , and Stella McCartney , to name a few  --  turned to supershort cuts this spring . Fledgling models have also taken the dare , but these are not Janet Reno do-it-yourselfers . Hmmm . If hemlines are indexed to a sagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , how do you afford the maintenance ? <P> WHAT 'S THAT FREQUENCY AGAIN ?
