Sometimes you do n't wake up . But if you happen to , you know things will never be the same . Sometimes that 's not so bad . Sometimes lives intersect , no rhyme , no reason , except , perhaps , for a passing semi . Triad Three separate highways intersect at a place no reasonable person would ever want to go . Three lives that would have been cut short , if not for hasty interventions by loved ones . Or Fate . Three people , with nothing at all in common except age , proximity , and a wish to die . Three tapestries , tattered at the edges and come unwoven to reveal a single mutual thread . The Thread Wish you could turn off the questions , turn off the voices , turn off allsound . Yearn to close out the ugliness , close out the filthiness , close out all light . Long to cast away yesterday , cast away memory , cast away all jeopardy . Pray you could somehow stop the uncertainty , somehow stop the loathing , somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , in perfect sync , precisely timed so you do n't have to think . Just stroll right in . I doubt it 's quite as easy to turn around and walk back outside , retreat to unstable ground . Home turf . An orderly escorts me down spit-shined corridors , past tinted Plexiglas and closed , unmarked doors . Mysteries . One foot in front of the other , counting tiles on the floor so I do n't have to focus the blur of painted smiles , fake faces . A mannequin in a tight blue suit , with a too-short skirt ( and legs that can wear it ) , in a Betty Boop voice halts us . I 'm Dr. Boston . Welcome to Aspen Springs . I 'll give you the tour . Paul , please take his things to the Redwood Room . Aspen Springs . Redwood Room . As if this place were a five-star resort , instead of a lockdown where crazies pace . Waiting . At Least It does n't have a hospital stink . Oh yes , it 's all very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spotless . But the clean comes minus the gag-me smell , steeping every inch of that antiseptic hell where they excised the damnable bullet . I wonder what Dad said when he heard I tried to put myself six feet under  --  and failed . I should have put the gun to my head , worried less about brain damage , more about getting dead . Finis . Instead , I decided a shot through the heart would make it stop beating , rip it apart to bleed me out . I could n't even do that right . The bullet hit bone , left my heart in one piece . In hindsight , luck was n't with me that day . Mom found me too soon , or my pitiful life might have ebbed to the ground in arterial flow . I thought she might die too , at the sight of so much blood and the thought of it staining her white Armani blouse . Conner , what have you done ? she said . Tell me this was just an accident . She never heard my reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , except for speed . Ghostly red lights , spinning faster and faster , as I began to recede from consciousness . Floating through the ER doors , frenzied motion . A needle 's sting . But I do remember , just before the black hole swallowed me , seeing Mom 's face . Her furious eyes followed me down into sleep . It 's a curious place , the Land of Blood Loss and Anesthesia , floating through it like swimming in sand . Taxing . After a while , you think you should reach for the shimmering surface . You ca n't hold your breath , and even if you could , it 's dark and deep and bitter cold , where nightmares and truth collide , and you wonder if death could unfold fear so real . Palpable . So you grope your way up into the light , to find you ca n't move , with your arms strapped tight and overflowing tubes . And everything hits you like a train at full speed . Voices . Strange faces . A witches ' stewpot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony Just Saw A new guy check in . Tall , built , with a way fine face , and acting too tough to tumble . He 's a nutshell asking to crack . Wonder if he 's ever let a guy touch that pumped-up bod . They gave him the Redwood Room . It 's right across from mine  --  the Pacific Room . Pretty peaceful in here most of the time , long as my meds are on time . Ha . Get it ? Most of the time , if my meds are on time . If you do n't get it , you 've never been in a place like this , never hung tough from one med call till the next . Wasted . That 's the only way to get by in this " treatment center . " Nice name for a loony bin . Everyone in here is crazy one way or another . Everyone . Even the so-called doctors . Most of ' em are druggies . Fucking loser meth freaks . I mean , if you 're gon na purposely lose your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't you ? Okay , maybe not . I Lost My Mind A long time ago , but it was n't exactly my idea . Shit happens , as they say , and my shit literally hit the fan . But enough sappy crap . We were talking drugs . I wo n't tell you I never tried crystal , but it really was n't my thing . I saw enough people , all wound up , drop over the edge , that I guess I decided not to take that leap . I always preferred creeping into a giant , deep hole where no bad feelings could follow . At least till I had to come up for air . I diddled with pot first , but that tasty green weed could n't drag me low enough . Which mostly left downers , " borrowed " from medicine cabinets and kitchen cabinets and nightstands . Wherever I could find them . And once in a while  --  not often , because it was pricey and tough to score  --  once in a while , I tumbled way low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah , that 's what I 'm talking about . A hot shot clear to hell .
