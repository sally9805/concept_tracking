<p> TORINO , Italy  --  Throughout the closing laps of a grueling speedskating victory here Friday , the USA 's Chad Hedrick let his tongue hang out . The work crews that are trying to ready this oft-ignored metropolis for the Feb.10-26 Winter Olympics know the feeling . <p> Torino is that rare Italian city that 's known more for assembly lines than savoring la dolce vita . Now , as the largest city to host a Winter Olympics , this 900,000-population hub of Fiat 's dwindling auto empire has ensnared itself in a web of multitasking . <p> A subway project that was approved before Torino won the Olympic bid has torn up historic areas and made traffic jams a way of life . Renovations have hidden key portions of the city 's baroque architecture behind scaffolding . <p> Replacing the stone floors of Torino 's most welcoming piazzas has led to temporarily fencing off the plazas that would best accommodate pre-Olympic revelry . <p> In a city renowned for soothing tired visitors with chocolate and caffeine , the aromas from bakeries and the grinding of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust and the rumble of cement mixers . <p> For anyone who senses a familiar story , Torino 's angst echoes what Athens endured in the prelude to its stunningly calamity-free 2004 Summer Olympics just 16 months ago . <p> Torino Mayor Sergio Chiamparino drove home that point with blunt honesty Friday when , more than a year behind schedule , he celebrated the completion of the last venue , the Oval Lingotto speedskating arena . <p> " Even if one week ago there was just sand instead of ice here , the oval is ready and done today , " Chiamparino said . " And even if , as happens with most of the greatest events , everything will be a mess until just one week before the Olympics , Torino is ready . " <p> Chiamparino and all the top executives of Torino 's Olympic organizing committee ( TOROC ) count themselves as ottimistas , or optimists . <p> " It will be done on time " is their mantra , even though the airport is in a shambles with much of the ceiling torn apart or wrapped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are loose ends in a massive urban renewal that has doubled the city 's rail capacity , flattened abandoned factories and provided facelifts for several of Torino 's 40-some museums . <p> To cope with the distraction of those ongoing projects that are n't finished in time for opening ceremonies , Torino simply will resort to the Italian gift for facade and drape them in its trademark color  --  Torino red . <p> " It will be part of the Olympic look , " TOROC spokesman Giuseppe Gattino says . <p> " Stopping all of these transformations would be impossible . ... I do n't mean to say it 's the best way ever to do things , but the point is we 'll be ready in time , and the city will be at its best . " <p> Nonetheless , some tweaking of venues is still ahead . <p> At the Oval Lingotto there 's work to be done on the ice , which was soft for competition when the full lighting system and body heat of spectators raised the arena temperature . <p> " It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Mark Messer , Calgary 's icemaker . " It 's not going to be the same for the Olympics . I think we 're going to have the ability to tailor-make it for the Olympics . " <p> Less understandable is why adjustments still are being made at both hockey venues . At Palasport , organizers scheduled a second " test event "  --  a friendly match between Italy and Canada  --  for today to test the arena at full capacity . At Torino Esposizioni , the secondary site , ice-making equipment still being installed also needs testing . <p> Taking its place on the map <p> This 21st-century renaissance is the latest oddity of a singular timeline that has seen Torino , in the northwest part of the country , trashed by Hannibal and his elephants in 218 B.C. and rise briefly to rule as the capital of a reunified Italy in 1861 . The Olympic goal is to at least vault Torino 's image onto the fringe of the tourist planning that traditionally focuses on Rome , Florence and Venice . <p> In the compact downtown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks among the world 's finest for Egyptian relics , to the Mole Antonelliana , which celebrates Torino as the birthplace of Italian cinema . Then on to Carlo Biscaretti di Ruffia auto museum , housing Gloria Swanson 's luxurious wheels from Sunset Boulevard . <p> For the moment , though , finding anything Olympic-related is n't easy . There is an Olympic Superstore and a sprinkling of Olympic banners , many old and tattered . <p> But the non-sports-minded tourist easily could focus on ornate iron balconies and the glittering treatment of snowball-like lights above Via Garibaldi while never realizing the world 's greatest skiers , skaters and hockey players are about to descend on this center of the Piedmont wine-making region . <p> " I do n't know if they really know the Olympics are going on , " says Chiara Simionato , Italy 's best hope for a medal in women 's speedskating . " I do n't know if they feel it . <p> " If I think back to the Summer Games , people were speaking about the Athens Olympics six months before . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit still lacking <p> At last weekend 's World Cup speedskating event here , Dutch fan Garrit Jonkar , an accountant , complained about Torino 's sedate downtown and said , " Every night there should be a party in town , stimulating the folks , getting them ready for the Olympics . " <p> With European television showing there were only about 1,000 spectators in the 8,100-capacity speedskating arena Friday , Dutch fan Marga Broekhuis said , " I just got a text message saying , ' It 's not very busy over there , is it ? ' " <p> U.S. speedskater Jennifer Rodriguez , winner of two bronze medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics , says , " At Salt Lake , it seemed like they had banners way before , like a year before , and you knew the Olympics were coming . " <p> Rodriguez adds : " I was walking around on a Sunday ( here ) , and there were people working . I think they 're trying to work around the clock , and there 's a lot to be done . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the issue of Olympic spirit , TOROC spokesman Gattino points out that when volunteers were sought for the Games , there were more than 40,000 applications for 20,000 positions . <p> He adds that January will bring a sudden surge of Olympic decoration and ramp-up events , but he readily concedes the municipal reserve about the Olympics is in keeping with Torino 's character . <p> " We were and still are the most important Italian city in terms of producing things , " Gattino says . " The attitude of people here is very disciplined and very much an attitude toward work . ... People in Torino thought they had to produce , they had to build cars . Leisure was the last thing . " <p> But work is a shrinking commodity in Torino . <p> At its peak as Italy 's Motown in the ' 80s , Fiat had 100,000 employees here . Now , it 's 15,000 . <p> Retired bank worker Gabriella Campese says of Torino 's somewhat leery attitude toward a Games that has a $1.5billion budget : " We are a city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very difficult period . A lot of people are at home . " <p> Software technician Marco Ronco says : " If you want to come here in February you must have a lot of money , so we say this is an American situation . This is not for Torino people , not for Fiat people . " <p> Hefty problems to overcome <p> Like every Olympics , some problems simply are beyond the organizing committee 's control . <p> TOROC has sold 60% of the Games ' fan tickets and might have benefited from publicity for last weekend 's World Cup speedskating , as Italy won two gold medals in a sport where it has never claimed an Olympic medal . But because of a newspaper union strike , the 96 credentials issued to Italian journalists went essentially unclaimed . <p> Off the ice , it 's Italy 's tough anti-doping laws , under which athletes face criminal sanctions for doping , that have gotten all the attention for going against International Olympic Committee requirements that Games ' doping violations not result in legal penalties . <p> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government supervisor for the Games , announced a solution had been found . <p> " I was optimistic and now I am happy that we have found a solution that respects Italian law but eliminates all the dangers we faced , " Pescante told the Associated Press , adding details would be shared in the coming weeks . <p> But a far bigger problem is brewing on the narrow roads that lead up to the Alpine areas that are part of the skiing paradise known as " The Milky Way . " <p> In the Susa Valley , mayors of 20 towns are leading opposition to drilling two mountain tunnels  --  one 35 miles long  --  for a high-speed rail system that will connect Torino to Lyon , France , and help link eastern and western Europe . <p> The proposed rail line  --  known as TAV  --  is part of a $23.5 billion project that will take 15 to 20 years . <p> The resistance has drawn thousands at some demonstrations and stems from one tunnel site being filled with natural asbestos , while the other contains uranium . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3a.m. raid by police on an encampment of 200 protesters that sent at least 20 people to the hospital . <p> Shelley Osterloh , an NBC-affiliate reporter for KSL in Salt Lake City , says her tour of Olympic mountain venues was turned back last week because police said it was " too dangerous " to go up . <p> " No TAV " has become the predominant graffiti in downtown Torino . Last week the Olympic countdown clock in Piazza Castello , where medals ceremonies will be held , was painted with the words L'amianto respiratelo voi  --  " You breathe the asbestos . " <p> With the Olympics in Torino , TOROC spokesman Gattino acknowledges the protesters " of course could have the best stage ever . " <p> But he says that after meetings in Rome last weekend with Susa Valley mayors and top Italian government figures , " I think they can have an Olympic truce . The hope we have is that in the next weeks an agreement should be found to protect the Games from this problem .
