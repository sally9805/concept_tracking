THE MYSTERIOUS AND DELICATE NATURE OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN OUTSIDE AND INSIDE , CONTAINER AND CONTENTS , IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL THEMES IN IWATA 'S WORK . // I still recall the vividly odd , quiet , detached and yet somehow demanding presence of the first piece I ever saw by Kiyomi Iwata . What 's that ? I wanted to know , and asked . The question meant , in part , Who made it ? but more significantly was a literal-minded demand to know just what it was I was looking at , because I had never seen anything like it : a volume without mass . The feeling it gave was on the one hand as if it were not quite there , or seen in the process of becoming not quite there , something like a soap bubble that must either change shape or burst before you can take hold with your perception of its shape at any moment of its existence . But on the other hand it really sat there plainly and bluntly , almost like any small , ponderable common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl or a box , for instance , but probably something more fanciful , like the formally not dissimilar " dinosaur egg " my daughter once made out of papier-mache , which now sits on one of my bookshelves . What was this half-ethereal , half-homely , **25;1481;TOOLONG yet also precious-looking , even auratic thing that had caught my eye ? It was a slightly crumpled little spheroid made of silk organza , pale and translucent , though parts of it were delicately covered or dusted over with irregular bits of fine gold leaf . But it was n't quite a whole sphere-more like one that had been pieced together , taken apart and reconstructed , so that there were overlaps , tiny gaps and bits of thread sticking out like unkempt hair . A basic , almost nondescript form , and yet one that looked as if it had a history , even that it had had a life . A thing in itself , yet the remains of a thing . Beautiful above all in the way its surpassing fragility and its inner toughness coincided , its ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later I discovered that Iwata has done quite a few such quasi-spherical sculptures , as well as similar pieces that are more boxlike . Some are intensely colored . The gold leaf Iwata often uses , though usually sparingly , seems to serve a double function . By dispersing light , it slightly " dematerializes " the otherwise intensely palpable surfaces-idealizes them , one might almost say . At the same time it provides an aura of richness , of elegance , as though these objects were very precious gifts-as indeed they are . There are pieces that are closed in by being tied in a knot , others that are open . Black Gauze Box , 1987 , exhibited in 2001 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , is not only open at the top but is loosely meshed all around , and threads rise up from its corners like tongues of dark flame . In all of these works , however , there is an implicit tension between interior and exterior that can be extreme . The stiffened surface of fine mesh appears as a sort of membrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One feels as if , were one to handle the thing too roughly , this void would be squeezed out , the tension lost , a life drained away . The mysterious and delicate nature of the connection between outside and inside , container and contents , is one of the central themes in Iwata 's work . Her sculptural forms may appear to be containers-yet they contain nothing other than their own fragility and beauty . Or they are containers , perhaps , of memories that reach back to a childhood that is , in fact , still alive within the mature adult .

In his famous essay " Art and Objecthood " ( 1967 ) , Michael Fried noted as a fault the impression of " hollowness " given by Minimalist ( or as he called it , " literalist " ) sculpture-evoking an anthropomorphism , perhaps like that of bronze statuary , but unacknowledged . Abstract as Iwata 's silksculptures are , there is no question as to where they stand on the issue of anthropomorphism : they evoke the body in all its splendor and pathos . In this , they place themselves in the tradition of Eva Hesse , who also worked with minimal , quasigeometrical forms-often closed in on themselves or just partly open , as with Iwata 's objectsbut made them overtly corporeal , human , almost expressionistic . This relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejecting , like Fried- becomes even more obvious in those of Iwata 's works that ( again , like many of Hesse 's , as of minimalists like Donald Judd ) employ reiterations of similar units in grids . Water , Earth and Sky , 2002 , is a wall-mounted array of 25 translucent , whitish boxlike forms with just a small amount of gold leaf , most of it gathered in the second-lowest row of five to create the suggestion of a horizon . Sited on a wall-against gravity- rather than on a horizontal surface , a pictorial aspect generates a sort of tension with the work 's insistent tactility that relieves it of some of the pathos characteristic ofthe discrete objects.That the group has the force of a unified picture , despite being anything but , gives the emptiness of the space between the units a formal weight that does not attach to the space surrounding the single-object sculptures . Another series of works consists not of volumes but of hanging surfaces of an industrial " fabric , " brass mesh , which has then been partly covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure , but they evoke scrolls even more . So it is not surprising that recently the artist has been inscribing these surfaces with Japanese poetry , but in gold so that the calligraphy becomes almost submerged in the glow of the surface , a material radiance whose richness can be somewhat off-putting . The inscription from the 18th-century poet Chora on Iwata 's Auric Grid Hanging with Tanka3 , 2002 , seems to predict the object 's own possible future ; the poem 's English translation reads , " The gold is tarnished . The young leaves take us back to olden times . " Kiyomi Iwata 's art is a rare synthesis of traditional Japanese and contemporary Western aesthetics . To fully appreciate it one would probably have to be as literate in her two cultures as the artist herself is-which is not to say that there 's anything hermetic or patently " difficult " about it . But its simplicity is full of resonances which one need not be able to decipher in any precise way . It 's the fact of the resonance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Gauze Box , 1987 , silk gauze woven by American Silk Mill , 7 by 7 by 7 inches , collection of Metropolitan Museum of Art ; Water , Earth and Sky , 2002 , silk organza , gold leaf , 39 1/2 by 39 1/2 by 6 inches ; Red Sphere 2,2002 , silk organza , dyed , 8 by 7 by 7 inches .
