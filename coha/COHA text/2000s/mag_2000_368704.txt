In a normal election , if there is such a thing , it ought to be clear by the end what the race is about  --  whether the candidates are promising continuity or change , bright contrasts or fine distinctions ; whether it is about character or competence ; whether the results will actually matter in most people 's lives or just change the background music on the evening news while they go about multitasking and instant messaging and sorting the laundry and paying the bills . <P> But this election , this confoundingly close race , just dares wavering voters to make a decision and stick with it . It 's even hard to choose whom to blame for its being so hard to choose . Could they be more alike , the two political princes , Texas and Tennessee , Harvard and Yale , the compassionate conservative against the pragmatic idealist ? Could they be more different , one so unpolished it 's hard to imagine , the other so shiny it hurts to look . Vice President Al Gore runs as a populist who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backed by more G.O.P. fat cats than any other Republican in memory , delivers " the best New Democrat speech ever given in prime time , " says a former Clinton adviser . <P> Gore is famous for his Halloween parties , has always appeared in costume . And thus it has been in this race  --  a cannibal in one debate , a Quaker in the next  --  and so voters say they do n't quite know what to believe about him . He says he wants small , smarter government , but he talks about programs and legislation as lovingly as he does his grandson . <P> And yet there is Bush , so consistent , so confusing , and not just because he is a speech pathologist 's dream . The real confusion is in what he says , not how he says it . He 's running harder against Washington than anyone in years , but he 's the first Republican in a decade who does n't want to blow up the Education Department and padlock the I.R.S. He wants to spend a trillion dollars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security taxes in the stock market , yet he promises not to cut benefits , although there would be no spare trillion lying around to fund them . He blasts Gore for proposing more new spending than at any time since the Great Society  --  except that he is doing the same . <P> Gore says he is for " revolutionary change " but has n't really proposed any ; he is running with his fists balled , itching for a fight  --  you ai n't seen nothin ' yet !  --  even though his entire platform amounts to massaging the feet of the middle class every bit as faithfully as Bill Clinton has these past eight years . Bush 's message meanwhile is so soothing  --  Ca n't we all just get along ?  --  and yet his reforms of Medicare and Social Security and education offer more change than anything either party has proposed in years  --  and that 's just the agenda he admits to . No wonder it 's confusing . <P> Bush has built his endgame around arguing that even if you agree with Gore 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Gore to prevail he will have to argue that Bush is masterminding a coverup : the centrism gets him elected , then a much more conservative agenda takes hold . He has to persuade people that Bush is a phony . And just about anyone might have an easier time doing that than Gore .
