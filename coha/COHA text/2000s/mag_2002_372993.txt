Who would n't want a high-profile Washington job that has a five-year term , pays $150,000 and puts 48,506 employees and a Gulfstream IV jet at your disposal ? Lots of people , apparently . Federal Aviation Administrator Jane Garvey is leaving in eight weeks , and there are no viable applicants lined up to replace her . Time is short : vetting a candidate can take months , and then the nominee must be approved by the Senate , which will recess on Aug. 2 . The Bush Administration is so desperate , it even asked Garvey , a Democrat , to stay . But she has had enough . Garvey is the first FAA chief in history to serve a five-year term . Even worse for the country 's air-safety system , the FAA still has not been able to fill the job of chief operating officer , created by Congress in 2000 . And the agency 's top career civil servant , Monte Belger , now acting deputy administrator , is calling it quits on July 31 . <P> Critics say the FAA is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucracy and stakeholders await a new leader . The airline industry is trying to hustle up its own candidates , but nobody yet seems willing to take the hefty pay cut for the privilege of being abused by airlines , Congress and frustrated flyers . Aviation-industry veterans are getting worried that the position might never attract a high-quality candidate . " The job is only good for a human punching bag , " says one .  --  By Sally B.
