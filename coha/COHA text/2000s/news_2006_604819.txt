<p> If things go according to plan , the world economy will chug along nicely through the new year . <p> That would be comforting news if things ever did go according to plan . <p> Actually , 2006 could see plenty of nasty surprises . For one thing , the world economy , though expanding , is dangerously imbalanced . The resulting U.S. current account deficit  --  reflecting the gap between the nation 's ravenous appetite for imports and its anemic savings  --  is now at levels that many experts fear could trigger a run on the dollar , soaring interest rates and global economic pain . <p> Meanwhile , investment is pouring into risky emerging markets as if the past decade 's turmoil in Argentina , Turkey , Thailand and Russia never happened . <p> And all that stands between a barrel of oil and a triple-digit price tag is a strike in Nigeria , unrest in Venezuela or revolution in Saudi Arabia . <p> For all that , both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank expect solid global growth of 3.2% this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prognosticators seem sanguine , perhaps it 's because many of the same warning signals flashed red one year ago , and yet , the economy still barreled ahead , even overcoming epic natural disasters . <p> " 2005 was a year that has lulled a lot of investors , policymakers and government officials into a dangerous and false sense of complacency , " says Stephen Roach , chief economist for Morgan Stanley in New York . <p> Terror attacks . A trade war with China . Even a historic epidemic of potentially lethal " bird flu . " There 's no end to the list of potential economic catastrophes that could arise this year . <p> But three dangers  --  mushrooming global imbalances , vulnerable emerging markets and volatile oil prices  --  seem especially noteworthy . <p> Too much red ink <p> To many economists , the swollen U.S. current account deficit looms as the biggest potential hazard . In a nutshell , the United States spends too much and saves too little , and Asia saves too much and spends too little . ( Moribund Europe does n't do enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the day of reckoning will come . But Roach , and many others , say the USA and the world can not go on like this indefinitely . <p> " There are significant downside risks to the global economy ... financial markets right now are not pricing in any of these risks , " warns Nouriel Roubini , a former White House economist in the Clinton administration who runs the influential www.rgemonitor.com website . <p> Last year , the U.S. financed its excessive spending by selling almost $800 billion worth of Treasury securities to foreign central banks and investors . <p> At 6.4% of total economic output , that 's an unprecedented level for a major economy . The U.S. is able to get away with such profligacy largely because the dollar plays a uniquely central role in global commerce . <p> But here 's how a crisis could unfold : If foreigners conclude the dollar was headed for a fall because of the enormous U.S. deficit , they would cut back on purchases of U.S. debt . To entice them to buy , the Federal Reserve would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could choke off economic growth , even as the falling dollar ignited inflation by boosting the prices of imported goods . <p> In 2005 , the dollar defied predictions of an inevitable decline . But it is unlikely to keep doing so , according to Roubini . <p> The greenback benefited last year from a one-time change in U.S. tax law that encouraged companies to repatriate foreign profits and from the Fed 's rate increases . <p> The tax provision has expired , and the Fed is believed to be near the end of its monetary tightening . <p> " Our ability to finance ourselves depends upon the willingness of foreign central banks to hold dollars . That willingness is going to be shrinking ( this ) year , " Roubini says . <p> Even under optimistic assumptions , once the crisis hits , the economic pain in the USA could be like nothing the country has suffered in decades . <p> An abrupt end to the USA 's ability to obtain sufficient foreign financing could send the dollar into free fall , cutting 21% to 28% from its value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UCLA 's Anderson School of Management . That would increase the price of a $21,000 foreign-made sedan to almost $27,000 , unless dealers opted to absorb the blow . <p> In the first year , 3.6% to 5% would be slashed from per capita economic growth . That would almost certainly push the USA into recession , perhaps for several years , according to Edwards , who presented his findings at last summer 's annual Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole , Wyo . <p> " Never in the history of modern economics has a large industrial country run persistent current account deficits of the magnitude posted by the U.S. since 2000 . " <p> Emerging market risks <p> Another danger might be brewing in the so-called emerging markets . Capital flows this year into developing nations in Latin America , Asia and Central Europe are expected to hit a record $345.2 billion , according to the Institute of International Finance . That surpasses the previous high set in 1996 , just before the Asian financial crisis , and is up 62% in the past two years . <p> Emerging markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thailand in 1997 , Russia in 1998 , and Argentina in 2000 . It 's different this time , say firms such as JPMorgan . Countries , particularly in Latin America , have built up foreign-exchange reserves that should allow them to ride out any financial crisis and have introduced economic reforms that give their economies greater stability . Rather than depend on private capital flows from rich countries as they did in the 1990s , developing nations now rely on strong export industries . <p> Bond holders are so impressed that they regard emerging market securities as little riskier than U.S. Treasuries , according to the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global ( EMBIG ) . In late 2002 , investors demanded an additional 91/2 percentage points of yield as compensation for the risk involved in holding emerging markets bonds compared with U.S. Treasuries . Today , the spread on the EMBIG is down to little more than 2 percentage points . <p> But emerging markets also have had the economic winds at their back for the past couple of years . Strong global demand boosted commodity prices , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers such as Venezuela . And U.S. interest rates were so low , yield-hungry investors  --  including normally cautious pension funds  --  were drawn into countries such as Brazil or Hungary . <p> Now , global growth is slowing , and U.S. rates are higher . " There 's a lot to worry about , " says Desmond Lachman of the American Enterprise Institute , who was among the first to warn of problems in Argentina before its historic default . <p> While no one is predicting a repeat of the problems that rocked half a dozen countries in the 1990s , emerging markets remain vulnerable to sharp changes in the global environment . If the dollar tanks , their surging exports would stall . Higher oil prices could deal them a double whammy , inflating their energy costs while depressing the economies of major customers . <p> Any unexpected mishap could cause the spreads between emerging market debt and U.S. securities to balloon , making it more expensive for corporations in developing countries to finance their operations , Lachman says . <p> Politics also might complicate the economic outlook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries this year , including presidential and legislative contests in Brazil and Mexico . The voting takes place amid a clear drift away from the free-market policies favored by the United States . <p> So far , little of this seems to be making an impression . " The markets seem to be pricing in close to zero probability of something going wrong , " Barclays Capital wrote in a Dec. 8 note to clients . <p> Energy ' super spike ' <p> One year ago , no one predicted twin hurricanes would wreck much of the U.S. Gulf Coast oil infrastructure , sparking gas shortages and soaring pump prices . But today , with oil prices at about $64 per barrel , it does n't take much imagination to conjure up fresh scenarios of price jumps . <p> Spare oil supplies amount to 1.9 million barrels per day , down from more than 6 million a day three years ago . Any event that idles significant output for a prolonged period  --  political turmoil in Venezuela , revolution in Saudi Arabia , a general strike in Nigeria  --  would threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so low , the market is particularly vulnerable to a supply shock , " the World Bank said in its 2006 economic forecast . <p> If oil supplies were cut by 2 million barrels per day , prices would hit $90 a barrel this year and remain at $70 next year , according to the World Bank . The price spike would add 2.6 percentage points to the inflation rate , which is 2.1% now , and cut global growth in half . <p> How likely is such a price spike ? Goldman Sachs oil analyst Arjun Murti spooked markets in March with a forecast of a " super spike " taking oil prices as high as $105 per barrel . On Dec. 12 , he reiterated that view in a note to clients , adding that " non-existent spare capacity " supported the prediction . <p> John Kingston , global director of oil for Platts , is more optimistic . He expects prices to ease this year with new producing wells in the Gulf of Mexico , Russia and Nigeria boosting the market 's cushion . <p> Still , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there of 1.4 million barrels remain below prewar levels , according to Platts . Anti-U.S . insurgents last year mounted 96 attacks on the country 's aging network of pipelines and production facilities , or one every four days . There is little reason to expect quick improvement . <p> " The spot that concerns me the most is Iraq , and not so much the insurgents , " he says . " The oil industry there has been held together by spit and bailing wire . ... It 's antiquated and needs massive capital investment . " <p> To those such as Roach , who are inclined to emphasize the risks that things wo n't go exactly as expected , the links between potential problems are the most worrisome element . The USA 's fat current account deficit could sink the dollar . As it plummets , emerging markets ' exports dry up and oil prices , which are denominated in dollars , rise . In no time , what starts as one country 's difficulty becomes a global contagion . <p> " This is what we signed up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The next global adjustment or downturn most likely will reverberate very quickly around the world with a speed we have n't seen before .
