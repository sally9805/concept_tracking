Orlando may be the home of Disney World and Universal Studios , but less than an hour away is another kind of child 's paradise . Merritt Island , Fla. , an Atlantic barrier island , is home to acres of wildlife habitat crisscrossed by navigable rivers ; the perfect place to spend the day boating with kids . It 's also the location of Sea Ray 's Sykes Creek plant . So , one hot Saturday morning , my husband , Gary ; stepdaughter , Kaitlyn , 8 ; her sister , Kalea , 3 , and I drove over to try out the new Sea Ray 200 Sport bowrider in this wonderful natural setting . As soon as the two girls climbed aboard the boat at the dock , they immediately went up to the bow . The 200 's forward cockpit is attractive both in its contemporary styling and its comfort level . It easily held the four of us , and could seat six , if most of them were kids . The girls liked the bow 's cushioned backrest , though not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat and lean forward against the pad to see tadpoles in the water in front of the boat . Curiosity also prompted them to open the anchor locker , which is a finished compartment with a plastic mat inside to protect both anchor and hull . There is storage under the forward seats , and two molded-in drinkholders and two grabrails to make riding up here safer and more fun . We let the girls stay in the bow while we pulled out from the plant 's private dock into the Barge Canal that cuts between the Intracoastal Waterway and the Banana River . The canal is a no-wake zone due to manatee restrictions , which ordinarily would be extremely frustrating for Gary and me . But having the girls along made it a blessing in disguise . The slower speeds allowed them to take in the sights around us : a flight of egrets taking off from the water ; an angler hooking a fish as we passed . We kept the walk-through windshield open to let a breeze into the aft cockpit . Kaitlyn got a turn at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big bucket helm seat . We all liked the look of the dash panel , which is " faux " carbon fiber embedded with gauges with stainless steel bezels . Our boat had an optional remote control pad for the Clarion stereo system on the dash , so we cranked up the tunes . The stereo 's main control head is located inside a locking glove box on the passenger console . Below the glove box is a molded-in cooler with a StarBoard top that could hold a couple of six-packs or , in our case , the girls ' milk . Beneath the cooler is space to store a bag of life jackets . On our test boat , the passenger seat was a back-to-back lounger , which pulled out into a flat bed . ( When Kalea felt like napping , however , she lay down on the optional snap-in Berber carpet beneath the shade of the bimini top . ) Aft , our boat had twin jump seats on either side of a motorbox . This is one of two optional cockpit arrangements for the 200 Sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helm bucket is also available . The standard layout places two bucket seats forward , a bench seat aft and a full sunpad over the engine compartment . The upholstery is all nicely made . While the 200 Sport will have to go head to head with bowrider models from other manufacturers such as Four Winns , Larson and Maxum , its level of fit and finish should make it very competitive . Our boat was equipped with upgrade power : a single 5.0L MerCruiser sterndrive with Thunderbolt V ignition . To get complete access to the engine , all I had to do was remove the two jump seats , grab the handle on the motorbox and pull it forward . The small sunpad aft also opened to reveal storage for the canvas . The hatch lid was not supported by a ram , however , and the wind blew it down on my head as I looked inside . Ouch ! Forward , a long ski/wakeboard storage locker in the cockpit sole did have a hydraulic ram to hold it open . Once we reached the Banana River , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls to sit down in the cockpit , where the boat 's deep gunwales and well-placed grabrails made us feel confident about their safety . I pushed the Mercury shifter/throttle forward and was rewarded with a blast of acceleration . The 200 Sport planed in three seconds at 2500 rpm . A peppy sportster , it responded instantly to the wheel . I put it through a series of sharp turns and was impressed by its jet boat-like performance as it cranked around the corners , kicking up spray , while the girls held on and screamed with delight . Top end was just over 45 mph . Next , we launched the towing tube that Sea Ray had thoughtfully provided , tying it to the stainless tow eye on the 200 Sport 's transom . Kaitlyn and Kalea climbed onto the swim platform  --  which though small , was big enough to accommodate them both  --  and got into the red tube . Their thrill ride prompted huge smiles , even from the three-year-old . They never wanted to come in . Soon , it was lunchtime , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Harbortown Marina and slid the boat into a small space along the bulkhead . Gary and I remarked how much easier to maneuver and more turnkey this sportboat was than the bigger cruiser we keep at home . It would be great to have both , we decided . After a tasty meal at the Nautical Spirits restaurant , we drove back to the Sykes Creek plant . As we tied up , a manatee lazily rose to the surface of the water just off the boat . While Gary and I marveled that this ungainly creature was causing so much fuss along Florida 's waterways , Kaitlyn and Kalea were simply enchanted . It was the perfect finish to a carefree family day on the water . Specifications : LOA Table <p>
