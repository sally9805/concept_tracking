They said a child had died in the attic . Her clothes had been discovered in the wall . I wanted to go up there , and to lie down near the wall , and be alone . They 'd seen her ghost now and then , the child . But none of these vampires could see spirits , really , at least not the way that I could see them . No matter . It was n't the company of the child I wanted . It was to be in that place . Nothing more could be gained from lingering near Lestat . I 'd come . I 'd fulfilled my purpose . I could n't help him . The sight of his sharply focused and unchanging eyes unnerved me , and I was quiet inside and full of love for those nearest me my human children , my dark-haired little Benji and my tender willowy Sybelle but I was not strong enough just yet to take them away . I left the chapel . I did n't even take note of who was there . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not an unruly place , or a neglected place , but I did n't notice who remained in the chapel when I left . Lestat lay as he had all along , on the marble floor of the chapel in front of the huge crucifix , on his side , his hands slack , the left hand just below the right hand , its fingers touching the marble lightly , as if with a purpose , when there was no purpose at all . The fingers of his right hand curled , making a little hollow in the palm where the light fell , and that too seemed to have a meaning , but there was no meaning . This was simply the preternatural body lying there without will or animation , no more purposeful than the face , its expression almost defiantly intelligent , given that months had passed in which Lestat had not moved . The high stained-glass windows were dutifully draped for him before sunrise . At night , they shone with all the wondrous candles scattered about the fine statues and relics which filled this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Mass under this high coved roof ; a priest had sung out the Latin words from an altar . It was ours now . It belonged to him Lestat , the man who lay motionless on the marble floor . Man . Vampire . Immortal . Child of Darkness . Any and all are excellent words for him . Looking over my shoulder at him , I never felt so much like a child . That 's what I am . I fill out the definition , as if it were encoded in me perfectly , and there had never been any other genetic design . I was perhaps seventeen years old when Marius made me into a vampire . I had stopped growing by that time . For a year , I 'd been five feet six inches . My hands are as delicate as those of a young woman , and I was beardless , as we used to say in that time , the years of the sixteenth century . Not a eunuch , no , not that , most certainly , but a boy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls . Only now does it seem something worthwhile , and that 's because I love the others my own : Sybelle with her woman 's breasts and long girlish limbs , and Benji with his round intense little Arab face . I stood at the foot of the stairs . No mirrors here , only the high brick walls stripped of their plaster , walls that were old only for America , darkened by the damp even inside the convent , all textures and elements here softened by the simmering summers of New Orleans and her clammy crawling winters , green winters I call them because the trees here are almost never bare . I was born in a place of eternal winter when one compares it to this place . No wonder in sunny Italy I forgot the beginnings altogether , and fashioned my life out of the present of my years with Marius . " I do n't remember . " It was a condition of loving so much vice , of being so addicted to Italian wine and sumptuous meals , and even the feel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palazzo were sinfully , wickedly heated by Marius 's exorbitant fires . His mortal friends ... human beings like me at that time ... scolded constantly about these expenditures : firewood , oil , candles . And for Marius only the finest candles of beeswax were acceptable . Every fragrance was significant . Stop these thoughts . Memories ca n't hurt you now . You came here for a reason and now you have finished , and you must find those you love , your young mortals , Benji and Sybelle , and you must go on . Life was no longer a theatrical stage where Banquo 's ghost came again and again to seat himself at the grim table . My soul hurt . Up the stairs . Lie for a little while in this brick convent where the child 's clothes were found . Lie with the child , murdered here in this convent , so say the rumormongers , the vampires who haunt these halls now , who have come to see the great Vampire Lestat in his Endymionlike sleep . I felt no murder here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staircase , letting my body find its human weight and human tread . After five hundred years , I know such tricks . I could frighten all the young ones the hangers-on and the gawkers just as surely as the other ancient ones did it , even the most modest , uttering words to evince their telepathy , or vanishing when they chose to leave , or now and then even making the building tremble with their power an interesting accomplishment even with these walls eighteen inches thick with cypress sills that will never rot . He must like the fragrances here , I thought . Marius , where is he ? Before I had visited Lestat , I had not wanted to talk very much to Marius , and had spoken only a few civil words when I left my treasures in his charge . After all , I had brought my children into a menagerie of the Undead . Who better to safeguard them than my beloved Marius , so powerful that none here dared question his smallest request . There is no telepathic link between us naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as this occurred to me , I realized without the aid of this telepathic link that I could not feel the presence of Marius in the building . I did n't know what had happened in that brief interval when I knelt down to look at Lestat . I did n't know where Marius was . I could n't catch the familiar human scents of Benji or Sybelle . A little stab of panic paralyzed me . I stood on the second story of the building . I leaned against the wall , my eyes settling with determined calm on the deeply varnished heart pine floor . The light made pools of yellow on the boards . Where were they , Benji and Sybelle ? What had I done in bringing them here , two ripe and glorious humans ? Benji was a spirited boy of twelve , Sybelle , a womanling of twenty-five . What if Marius , so generous in his own soul , had carelessly let them out of his sight ? " I 'm here , young one . " The voice was abrupt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just below me , having come up the steps behind me , or more truly , with his powers , having placed himself there , covering the preceding distance with silent and invisible speed . " Master , " I said with a little trace of a smile . " I was afraid for them for a moment . " It was an apology . " This place makes me sad . " He nodded . " I have them , Armand , " he said . " The city seethes with mortals . There 's food enough for all the vagabonds wandering here . No one will hurt them . Even if I were n't here to say so , no one would dare . " It was I who nodded now . I was n't so sure , really . Vampires are by their very nature perverse and do wicked and terrible things simply for the sport of it . To kill another 's mortal pet would be a worthy entertainment for some grim and alien creature , skirting the fringes here , drawn by remarkable events . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me smiling . Young one ! Who else would call me this but Marius , my Maker , and what is five hundred years to him ? " You went into the sun , child , " he continued with the same legible concern written on his kind face . " And you lived to tell the tale . " " Into the sun , Master ? " I questioned his words . But I myself did not want to reveal any more . I did not want to talk yet , to tell of what had happened , the legend of Veronica 's Veil and the Face of Our Lord emblazoned upon it , and the morning when I had given up my soul with such perfect happiness . What a fable it was . He came up the steps to be near me , but kept a polite distance . He has always been the gentleman , even before there was such a word . In ancient Rome , they must have had a term for such a person , infallibly good mannered , and considerate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy to rich and poor alike . This was Marius , and it had always been Marius , insofar as I could know . He let his snow-white hand rest on the dull satiny banister . He wore a long shapeless cloak of gray velvet , once perfectly extravagant , now downplayed with wear and rain , and his yellow hair was long like Lestat 's hair , full of random light and unruly in the damp , and even studded with drops of dew from outside , the same dew clinging to his golden eyebrows and darkening his long curling eyelashes around his large cobalt-blue eyes . There was something altogether more Nordic and icy about him than there was about Lestat , whose hair tended more to golden , for all its luminous highlights , and whose eyes were forever prismatic , drinking up the colors around him , becoming even a gorgeous violet with the slightest provocation from the worshipful outside world . In Marius , I saw the sunny skies of the northern wilderness , eyes of steady radiance which rejected any outside color , perfect portals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I want you to come with me . " " Where is that , Master , come where ? " I asked . I too wanted to be civil . He had always , even after a struggle of wits , brought such finer instincts out of me . " To my house , Armand , where they are now , Sybelle and Benji . Oh , do n't fear for them for a second . Pandora 's with them . They are rather astonishing mortals , brilliant , remarkably different , yet alike . They love you , and they know so much and have come with you rather a long way . " I flushed with blood and color ; the warmth was stinging and unpleasant , and then as the blood danced back away from the surface of my face , I felt cooler and strangely enervated that I felt any sensations at all . It was a shock being here and I wanted it to be over . " Master , I do n't know who I am in this new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I hesitated , but there was no use stopping it . " Do n't ask me to stay here just now . Maybe some time when Lestat is himself again , maybe when enough time has passed . I do n't know for certain , only that I ca n't accept your kind invitation now . " He gave me a brief accepting nod . With his hand he made a little acquiescent gesture . His old gray cloak had slipped off one shoulder . He seemed not to care about it . His thin black wool clothes were neglected , lapels and pockets trimmed in a careless gray dust . That was not right for him . He had a big shock of white silk at his throat that made his pale face seem more colored and human than it otherwise would . But the silk was torn as if by brambles . In sum , he haunted the world in these clothes , rather than was dressed in them . They were for a stumbler , not my old Master . I think he knew I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom above me . I wanted to reach the attic of this place , the half-concealed clothing of the dead child . I wondered at this story of the dead child . I had the impertinence to let my mind drift , though he was waiting . He brought me back with his gentle words : " Sybelle and Benji will be with me when you want them , " he said . " You can find us . We are n't far . You 'll hear the Appassionata when you want to hear it . " He smiled . " You 've given her a piano , " I said . I spoke of golden Sybelle . I had shut out the world from my preternatural hearing , and I did n't want just yet to unstop my ears even for the lovely sound of her playing , which I already missed overly much . As soon as we 'd entered the convent , Sybelle had seen a piano and asked in a whisper at my ear if she could play it . It was not in the chapel where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had told her it was n't quite proper , that it might disturb Lestat as he lay there , and we could n't know what he thought , or what he felt , or if he was anguished and trapped in his own dreams . " Perhaps when you come , you 'll stay for a while , " Marius said . " You 'll like the sound of her playing my piano , and maybe then we 'll talk together , and you can rest with us , and we can share the house for as long as you like . " I did n't answer . " It 's palatial in a New World sort of way , " he said with a little mockery in his smile . " It 's not far at all . I have the most spacious gardens and old oaks , oaks far older than those even out there on the Avenue , and all the windows are doors . You know how I like it that way . It 's the Roman style . The house is open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream . " " Yes , I know , " I whispered . " I think it 's falling now , is n't it ? " I smiled . " Well , I 'm rather spattered with it , yes , " he said almost gaily . " You come when you want to . If not tonight , then tomorrow ... " " Oh , I 'll be there tonight , " I said . I did n't want to offend him , not in the slightest , but Benji and Sybelle had seen enough of white-faced monsters with velvet voices . It was time to be off . I looked at him rather boldly , enjoying it for a moment , overcoming a shyness that had been our curse in this modern world . In Venice of old , he had gloried in his clothes as men did then , always so sharp and splendidly embellished , the glass of fashion , to use the old graceful phrase . When he crossed the Piazza San Marco in the soft purple of evening , all turned to watch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red velvet a flowing cape , and magnificently embroidered doublet , and beneath it a tunic of gold silk tissue , so very popular in those times . He 'd had the hair of a young Lorenzo de ' Medici , right from the painted wall . " Master , I love you , but now I must be alone , " I said . " You do n't need me now , do you , Sir ? How can you ? You never really did . " Instantly I regretted it . The words , not the tone , were impudent . And our minds being so divided by intimate blood , I was afraid he 'd misunderstand . " Cherub , I want you , " he said forgivingly . " But I can wait . Seems not long ago I spoke these same words when we were together , and so I say them again . " I could n't bring myself to tell him it was my season for mortal company , how I longed just to be talking away the night with little Benji , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sybelle play her sonata over and over again . It seemed beside the point to explain any further . And the sadness came over me again , heavily and undeniably , of having come to this forlorn and empty convent where Lestat lay , unable or unwilling to move or speak , none of us knew . " Nothing will come of my company just now , Master , " I said . " But you will grant me some key to finding you , surely , so that when this time passes ... " I let my words die . " I fear for you ! " he whispered suddenly , with great warmth . " Any more than ever before , Sir ? " I asked . He thought for a moment . Then he said , " Yes . You love two mortal children . They are your moon and stars . Come stay with me if only for a little while . Tell me what you think of our Lestat and what 's happened . Tell me perhaps , if I promise to remain very quiet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you 've so recently seen . " " You touch on it delicately , Sir , I admire you . You mean why did I believe Lestat when he said he had been to Heaven and Hell , you mean what did I see when I looked at the relic he brought back with him , Veronica 's Veil . " " If you want to tell me . But more truly , I wish you would come and rest . " I put my hand on top of his , marveling that in spite of all I 'd endured , my skin was almost as white as his . " You will be patient with my children till I come , wo n't you ? " I asked . " They imagine themselves so intrepidly wicked , coming here to be with me , whistling nonchalantly in the crucible of the Undead , so to speak . " " Undead , " he said , smiling reprovingly . " Such language , and in my presence . You know I hate it . " He planted a kiss quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized that he was gone . " Old tricks ! " I said aloud , wondering if he were still near enough to hear me , or whether he had shut up his ears to me as fiercely as I shut mine to the outside world . I looked off , wanting the quiet , dreaming of bowers suddenly , not in words but in images , the way my old mind would do it , wanting to lie down in garden beds among growing flowers , wanting to press my face to earth and sing softly to myself . The spring outside , the warmth , the hovering mist that would be rain . All this I wanted . I wanted the swampy forests beyond , but I wanted Sybelle and Benji , too , and to be gone , and to have some will to carry on . Ah , Armand , you always lack this very thing , the will . Do n't let the old story repeat itself now . Arm yourself with all that 's happened . Another was nearby . It seemed so awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know should intrude here on my random private thoughts , perhaps to make a selfish approximation of what I felt . It was only David Talbot . He came from the chapel wing , through the bridge rooms of the convent that connect it to the main building where I stood at the top of the staircase to the second floor . I saw him come into the hallway . Behind him was the glass of the door that led to the gallery , and beyond that the soft mingled gold and white light of the courtyard below . " It 's quiet now , " he said . " And the attic 's empty and you know that you can go there , of course . " " Go away , " I said . I felt no anger , only the honest wish to have my thoughts unread and my emotions left alone . With remarkable self-possession he ignored me , then said : " Yes , I am afraid of you , a little , but then terribly curious too . " " Oh , I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " " I did n't follow you , Armand , " he said . " I live here . " " Ah , I 'm sorry then , " I admitted . " I had n't known . I suppose I 'm glad of it . You guard him . He 's never alone . " I meant Lestat of course . " Everyone 's afraid of you , " he said calmly . He had taken up a position only a few feet away , casually folding his arms . " You know , it 's quite a study , the lore and habits of the vampires . " " Not to me , " I said . " Yes , I realize that , " he said . " I was only musing , and I hope you 'll forgive me . It was about the child in the attic , the child they said was murdered . It 's a tall story , about a very small little person . Maybe if your luck is better than that of everyone else , you 'll see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . " " Do you mind if I look at you ? " I said . " I mean if you 're going to dip your beak into my mind with such abandon ? We met some time ago before all this happened Lestat , the Heavenly Journey , this place . I never really took stock of you . I was indifferent , or too polite , I do n't know which . " I was surprised to hear such heat in my voice . I was volatile , and it was n't David Talbot 's fault . " I 'm thinking of the conventional knowledge about you , " I said . " That you were n't born in this body , that you were an elderly man when Lestat knew you , that this body you inhabit now belonged to a clever soul who could hop from living being to living being , and there set up shop with his own trespassing soul . " He gave me a rather disarming smile . " So Lestat said , " he answered . " So Lestat wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . You 've known since you saw me before . " " Three nights we spent together , " I said . " And I never really questioned you . I mean I never really even looked directly into your eyes . " " We were thinking of Lestat then . " " Are n't we now ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " David Talbot , " I said , measuring him coldly with my eyes , " David Talbot , Superior General of the Order of Psychic Detectives known as the Talamasca , had been catapulted into the body in which he now walks . " I did n't know whether I paraphrased or made it up as I went along . " He 'd been entrenched or chained inside it , made a prisoner by so many ropey veins , and then tricked into a vampire as a fiery unstanchable blood invaded his lucky anatomy , sealing his soul up in it as it transformed him into an immortal a man of dark bronzed skin and dry , lustrous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it right , " he said with indulgent politeness . " A handsome gent , " I went on , " the color of caramel , moving with such catlike ease and gilded glances that he makes me think of all things once delectable , and now a potpourri of scent : cinnamon , clove , mild peppers and other spices golden , brown or red , whose fragrances can spike my brain and plunge me into erotic yearnings that live now , more than ever , to play themselves out . His skin must smell like cashew nuts and thick almond creams . It does . " He laughed . " I get your point . " I had shocked myself . I was wretched for a moment . " I 'm not sure I get myself , " I said apologetically . " I think it 's plain , " he said . " You want me to leave you alone . " I saw the preposterous contradictions in all this at once . " Look , " I whispered quickly . " I 'm deranged , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads to make a knot : taste , see , smell , feel . I 'm rampant . " I wondered idly and viciously if I could attack him , take him , bring him down under my greater craft and cunning and taste his blood without his consent . " I 'm much too far along the road for that , " he said , " and why would you chance such a thing ? " What self-possession . The older man in him did indeed command the sturdier younger flesh , the wise mortal with an iron authority over all things eternal and supernaturally powerful . What a blend of energies ! Nice to drink his blood , to take him against his will . There is no such fun on Earth like the raping of an equal . " I do n't know , " I said , ashamed . Rape is unmanly . " I do n't know why I insult you . You know , I wanted to leave quickly . I mean I wanted to visit the attic , and then be out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are a wonder , and you think me a wonder , and it 's rich . " I let my eyes pass over him . I 'd been blind to him when we met last , that was most true . He dressed to kill . With the cleverness of olden times , when men could preen like peacocks , he 'd chosen golden sepia and umber colors for his clothes . He was smart and clean and fretted all over with careful bits of pure gold , in a wristband timepiece and buttons and a slender pin for his modern tie , that tailored spill of color men wear in this age , as if to let us grab them all the more easily by its noose . Stupid ornament . Even his shirt of polished cotton was tawny and full of something of the sun and the warmed earth . Even his shoes were brown , glossy as beetles ' backs . He came towards me . " You know what I 'm going to ask , " he said . " Do n't wrestle with these unarticulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Make a book out of it for me . " I could n't have predicted that this would be his question . I was surprised , sweetly so , but nevertheless taken off guard . " Make a book ? I ? Armand ? " I went towards him , turned sharply and fled up the steps to the attic , skirting the third floor and then entering the fourth . The air was thick and warm here . It was a place daily baked by the sun . All was dry and sweet , the wood like incense and the floors splintery . " Little girl , where are you ? " I asked . " Child , you mean , " he said . He had come up behind me , taking a bit of time for courtesy 's sake . He added , " She was never here . " " How do you know ? " " If she were a ghost , I could call her , " he said . I looked over my shoulder . " You have that power ? Or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? Before you venture further , let me warn you that we almost never have the power to see spirits . " " I 'm altogether new , " David said . " I 'm unlike any others . I 've come into the Dark World with different faculties . Dare I say , we , our species , vampires , have evolved ? " " The conventional word is stupid , " I said . I moved further into the attic . I spied a small chamber with plaster and peeling roses , big floppy prettily drawn Victorian roses with pale fuzzy green leaves . I went into the chamber . Light came from a high window out of which a child could not have seen . Merciless , I thought . " Who said that a child died here ? " I said . All was clean beneath the soil of years . There was no presence . It seemed perfect and just , no ghost to comfort me . Why should a ghost come from some savory rest for my sake ? So I could cuddle up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How are children murdered in orphanages where only nuns attend ? I never thought of women as so cruel . Dried up , without imagination perhaps , but not aggressive as we are , to kill . I turned round and round . Wooden lockers lined one wall , and one locker stood open , and there the tumbled shoes were , little brown Oxfords , as they called them , with black strings , and now I beheld , where it had been behind me , the broken and frayed hole from which they 'd ripped her clothes . All fallen there , moldy and wrinkled they lay , her clothes . A stillness settled on me as if the dust of this place were a fine ice , coming down from the high peaks of haughty and monstrously selfish mountains to freeze all living things , this ice , to close up and stop forever all that breathed or felt or dreamed or lived . He spoke in poetry : " Fear no more the heat of the sun , ' " he whispered . " Nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I winced with pleasure . I knew the verses . I loved them . I genuflected , as if before the Sacrament , and touched her clothes . " And she was little , no more than five , and she did n't die here at all . No one killed her . Nothing so special for her . " " How your words belie your thoughts , " he said . " Not so , I think of two things simultaneously . There 's a distinction in being murdered . I was murdered . Oh , not by Marius , as you might think , but by others . " I knew I spoke soft and in an assuming way , because this was n't meant for pure drama . " I 'm trimmed in memories as if in old furs . I lift my arm and the sleeve of memory covers it . I look around and see other times . But you know what frightens me the most it is that this state , like so many others with me , will prove the verge of nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really fear ? What did you want from Lestat when you came here ? " " David , I came to see him . I came to find out how it was with him , and why he lies there , unmoving . I came . " I was n't going to say any more . His glossy nails made his hands look ornamental and special , caressive , comely and lovely with which to be touched . He picked up a small dress , torn , gray , spotted with bits of mean lace . Everything dressed in flesh can yield a dizzying beauty if you concentrate on it long enough , and his beauty leapt out without apology . " Just clothes . " Flowered cotton , a bit of velvet with a puffed sleeve no bigger than an apple for the century of bare arms by day and night . " No violence at all surrounding her , " he said as if it were a pity . " Just a poor child , do n't you think , and sad by nature as well as circumstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me that ! What sin did these little dresses commit ? " I sighed . " Good God , David Talbot , why do n't we let the little girl have her romance , her fame ? You make me angry . You say you can see ghosts . You find them pleasant ? You like to talk with them . I could tell you about a ghost . " " When will you tell me ? Look , do n't you see the trick of a book ? " He stood up , and dusted off his knee with his right hand . In his left was her gathered dress . Something about the whole configuration bothered me , a tall creature holding a little girl 's crumpled dress . " You know , when you think of it , " I said , turning away , so I would n't see the dress in his hand , " there 's no good reason under God for little girls and little boys . Think of it , the other tender issue of mammals . Among puppies or kitten or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an issue . The half-grown fragile thing is sexless . There is no determination . There is nothing as splendid to look at as a little boy or girl . My head is so full of notions . I rather think I 'll explode if I do n't do something , and you say make a book for you . You think it 's possible , you think ... " " What I think is that when you make a book , you tell the tale as you would like to know it ! " " I see no great wisdom in that . " " Well , then think , for most speech is a mere issue of our feelings , a mere explosion . Listen , note the way that you make these outbursts . " " I do n't want to . " " But you do , but they are not the words you want to read . When you write , something different happens . You make a tale , no matter how fragmented or experimental or how disregarding of all conventional and helpful forms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a better idea . " " What ? " " Come down with me into my rooms . I live here now , I told you . Through my windows you can see the trees . I do n't live like our friend Louis , wandering from dusty corner to dusty corner , and then back to his flat in the Rue Royale when he 's convinced himself once more and for the thousandth time that no one can harm Lestat . I have warm rooms . I use candles for old light . Come down and let me write it , your story . Talk to me . Pace , and rant if you will , or rail , yes , rail , and let me write it , and even so , the very fact that I write , this in itself will make you make a form out of it . You 'll begin to ... " " What ? " " To tell me what happened . How you died and how you lived . " " Expect no miracles , perplexing scholar . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . " He had me faintly curious , but I could never do what he wanted . Nevertheless he was honest , amazingly so , as far as I could measure , and therefore sincere . " Ah , so , I did n't mean literally . I meant that you should tell me what it was like to climb so high into the sun , and suffer so much , and , as you said , to discover in your pain all these memories , these connecting links . Tell me ! Tell me . " " Not if you mean to make it coherent , " I said crossly . I gauged his reaction . I was n't bothering him . He wanted to talk more . " Make it coherent ? Armand , I 'll simply write down what you say . " He made his words simple yet curiously passionate . " Promise ? " I flashed on him a playful look . Me ! To do that . He smiled . He wadded up the little dress and then dropped it carefully so it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . " I 'll not alter one syllable , " he said . " Come be with me , and talk to me , and be my love . " Again , he smiled . Suddenly he came towards me , much in the aggressive manner in which I 'd thought earlier to approach him . He slipped his hands under my hair , and felt of my face , and then he gathered up the hair and he put his face down into my curls , and he laughed . He kissed my cheek . " Your hair 's like something spun from amber , as if the amber would melt and could be drawn from candle flames in long fine airy threads and let to dry that way to make all these shining tresses . You 're sweet , boylike and pretty as a girl . I wish I had one glimpse of you in antique velvet the way you were for him , for Marius . I wish I could see for one moment how it was when you dressed in stockings and wore a belted doublet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . My love does n't even touch you . " This was n't true . His lips were hot , and I could feel the fangs under them , feel the urgency suddenly in his fingers pressing against my scalp . It sent the shivers through me , and my body tensed and then shuddered , and it was sweet beyond prediction . I resented this lonely intimacy , resented it enough to transform it , or rid myself of it utterly . I 'd rather die or be away , in the dark , simple and lonely with common tears . From the look in his eyes , I thought he could love without giving anything . Not a connoisseur , just a blood drinker . " You make me hungry , " I whispered . " Not for you but for one who is doomed and yet alive . I want to hunt . Stop it . Why do you touch me ? Why be so gentle ? " " Everyone wants you , " he said . " Oh , I know . Everyone would ravage a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows his way around the block . Kids make better food than women , and girls are all too much like women , but young boys ? They 're not like men , are they ? " " Do n't mock me . I meant I wanted only to touch you , to feel how soft you are , how eternally young . " " Oh , that 's me , eternally young , " I said . " You speak nonsense words for one so pretty yourself . I 'm going out . I have to feed . And when I 've finished with that , when I 'm full and hot , then I 'll come and I 'll talk to you and tell you anything you want . " I stepped back just a little from him , feeling the quivers through me as his fingers released my hair . I looked at the empty white window , peering too high for the trees . " They could see nothing green here , and it 's spring outside , southern spring . I can smell it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment on flowers . To kill , to drink blood and to have flowers . " " Not good enough . Want to make the book , " he said . " Want to make it now and want you to come with me . I wo n't hang around forever . " " Oh , nonsense , of course you will . You think I 'm a doll , do n't you ? You think I 'm cute and made of poured wax , and you 'll stay as long as I stay . " " You 're a bit mean , Armand . You look like an angel , and talk like a common thug . " " Such arrogance ! I thought you wanted me . " " Only on certain terms . " " You lie , David Talbot , " I said . I headed past him for the stairs . Cicadas sang in the night as they often do , to no clock , in New Orleans . Through the nine-pane windows of the stairwell , I glimpsed the flowering trees of spring , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . Down and down we went , walking like regular men , down to the first floor , and out the sparkling glass doors and into the broad lighted space of Napoleon Avenue with its damp , sweet park of green down the middle , a park thick with carefully planted flowers and old gnarled and humble , bending trees . The whole picture moved with the subtle river winds , and wet mist swirled but would not fall into rain itself , and tiny green leaves drifted down like wilting ashes to the ground . Soft soft southern spring . Even the sky seemed pregnant with the season , lowering yet blushing with reflected light , giving birth to the mist from all its pores . Strident perfume rose from the gardens right and left , from purple Four O'Clocks , as mortals call them here , a rampant flower like unto weed , but infinitely sweet , and the wild irises stabbing upwards like blades out of the black mud , throaty petals monstrously big , battering themselves on old walls and concrete steps , and then as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roses of the young , roses too whole for the tropical night , roses coated with poison . There had been streetcars here once on this center strip of grass . I knew it , that the tracks had run along this wide deep green space where I walked ahead of him , slumward , riverward , deathward , bloodward . He came after me . I could close my eyes as I walked , never losing a step , and see the streetcars . " Come on , follow me , " I said , describing what he did , not inviting him . Blocks and blocks within seconds . He kept up . Very strong . The blood of an entire Royal Vampire court was inside him , no doubt of it . Count on Lestat to make the most lethal of monsters , that is , after his initial seductive blunders Nicolas , Louis , Claudia not a single one of the three able to take care of themselves alone , and two perished , and one lingering and perhaps the weakest vampire yet walking in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown face startled me . He looked lacquered all over , waxed , buffed , and once again I thought of spicy things , of the meat of candied nuts , and delicious aromas , of chocolates sweet with sugar and dark rich butterscotch , and it seemed a good thing suddenly to maybe grab ahold of him . But this was no substitute for one rotten , cheap , ripe and odoriferous mortal . And guess what ? I pointed . " Over there . " He looked as I directed him . He saw the sagging line of old buildings . Mortals everywhere lurked , slept , sat , dined , wandered , amid tiny narrow stairs , behind peeling walls and under cracked ceilings . I had found one , most perfect in his wickedness , a great flurry of hateful embers , of malice and greed and contempt smoldering as he waited for me . We 'd come to Magazine Street and passed it , but we were not at the river , only almost , and this was a street I had no recollection of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their city , Louis 's and Lestat 's just a narrow street with these houses the color of driftwood under the moon and windows hung with makeshift coverings , and inside there was this one slouching , arrogant , vicious mortal fixed to a television set and guzzling malt from a brown bottle , ignoring the roaches and the pulsing heat that pressed in from the open window , this ugly , sweating , filthy and irresistible thing , this flesh and blood for me . The house was so alive with vermin and tiny despicable things that it seemed no more than a shell surrounding him , crackling and friable and the same color in all its shadows as a forest . No antiseptic modern standards here . Even the furniture rotted in the trashy clutter and damp . Mildew covered the grinding white refrigerator . Only the reeky personal bed and rags gave off the clue to reigning domesticity . It was a proper nest in which to find this fowl , this ugly bird , thick rich pluckable , devourable sack of bones and blood and shabby plumage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human stench rising like a swirl of gnats , and thereby put it off its hinges , but not with much sound . I walked on newspapers strewn on painted wood . Orange peels turned to brownish leather . Roaches running . He did n't even look up . His swollen drunken face was blue and eerie , black eyebrows thick and unkempt , and yet he looked quite possibly a bit angelic , due to the light from the tube . He flicked the magic plastic twanger in his hand to make the channels change , and the light flared and flickered soundlessly , and then he let the song rise , a band playing , a travesty , people clapping . Trashy noises , trashy images , like the trash all around him . All right , I want you . No one else does . He looked up at me , a boy invader , David too far off for him to see , waiting . I pushed the television set to the side . It teetered , then fell onto the floor , its parts breaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now splinters of glass . A momentary fury overcame him , charging his face with sluggish recognition . He rose up , arms out , and came at me . Before I sank my teeth , I noticed that he had long tangled black hair . Dirty but rich . He wore it back by means of a knotted bit of rag at the base of his neck and then straggling down his checkered shirt in a thick tail . Meantime , he had enough syrupy and beer-besotted blood in him for two vampires , delicious , ugly , and a raging fighting heart , and so much bulk it was like riding a bull to be on him . In the midst of the feed , all odors rise to sweetness , even the most rancid . I thought I would quietly die of joy , as always . I sucked hard enough to fill my mouth , letting the blood roll over my tongue , and then to fill my stomach , if I have one , but above all just to stanch this greedy dirty thirst , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fought , and did the stupid thing of tearing at my fingers , and then the most dangerous and clumsy thing of trying to find my eyes . I shut them tight and let him press with his greasy thumbs . It did him no good . I am an impregnable little boy . You can not blind the blind . I was too full of blood to care . Besides it felt good . Those weak things that would scratch you do only stroke you . His life went by as if everyone he ever loved were riding a roller coaster under snazzy stars . Worse than a Van Gogh painting . You never know the palette of the one you kill until the mind disgorges its finest colors . Soon enough he sank down . I went with him . I had my left arm all the way around him now , and I lay childlike against his big muscular belly , and I drew the blood out now in the blindest gushes , pressing everything he thought and saw and felt down into only color , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second , as he died as the death passed me by , like a big rolling ball of black strength which turns out to be nothing actually , nothing but smoke or something even less than that as this death came into me and went out again like the wind , I thought , Do I by crushing everything that he is deprive him of a final knowing ? Nonsense , Armand . You know what the spirits know , what the angels know . The bastard is going home ! To Heaven . To Heaven that would not have you , and might never . In death , he looked most excellent . I sat beside him . I wiped my mouth , not that there was a drop to wipe . Vampires slobber blood only in motion pictures . Even the most mundane immortal is far too skilled to spill a drop . I wiped my mouth because his sweat was on my lips and on my face , and I wanted it to go away . I admired him , however , that he was big and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black hair clinging to his wet chest where the shirt had been so inevitably torn away . His black hair was something to behold . I ripped the knotted cloth that tied it . It was as full and thick as a woman 's hair . Making sure he was dead , I wrapped its length around my left hand and purposed to pull the whole mass from his scalp . David gasped . " Must you do this ? " he asked me . " No , " I said . Even then a few thousand strands had ripped loose from the scalp , each with only its tiny blooded root winking in the air like a tiny firefly . I held the mop for a moment and then let it slip out of my fingers and fall down behind his turned head . Those unanchored hairs fell sloppily over his coarse cheek . His eyes were wet and wakeful-seeming , dying jelly . David turned and went out into the little street . Cars roared and clattered by . A ship on the river sang with a steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust off me . One blow and I could have set the whole house to falling down , just caving in on the putrid filth within , dying softly amid other houses so no one indoors here would even know , all this moist wood merely caving . I could not get the taste and smell of this sweat gone . " Why did you so object to my pulling out his hair ? " I asked . " I only wanted to have it , and he 's dead and beyond caring and no one else will miss his black hair . " He turned with a sly smile and took my measure . " You frighten me , the way you look , " I said . " Have I so carelessly revealed myself to be a monster ? You know , my blessed mortal Sybelle , when she is not playing the Sonata by Beethoven called the Appassionata , watches me feed all the time . Do you want me to tell my story now ? " I glanced back at the dead man on his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above him stood a blue glass bottle and in it was an orange flower . Is n't that the damnedest thing ? " Yes , I do want your story , " David said . " Come , let 's go back together . I only asked you not to take his hair for one reason . " " Yes ? " I asked . I looked at him . Rather genuine curiosity . " What was the reason then ? I was only going to pull out all his hair and throw it away . " " Like pulling off the wings of a fly , " he offered seemingly without judgment . " A dead fly , " I said . I deliberately smiled . " Come now , why the fuss ? " " I wanted to see if you 'd listen to me , " he said . " That 's all . Because if you did then it might be all right between us . And you stopped . And it is . " He turned around and took my arm . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , you do , Armand , " he answered . " Let me write it . Pace and rail and rant . You 're very high and mighty right now because you have those two splendid little mortals hanging on your every gesture , and they 're like acolytes to a god . But you want to tell me the story , you know you do . Come on ! " I could n't stop myself from laughing . " Have these tactics worked for you in the past ? " Now it was his turn to laugh and he did , good-naturedly . " No , I suppose not , " he said . " But let me put it to you this way , write it for them . " " For whom ? " " For Benji and Sybelle . " He shrugged . " No ? " I did n't answer . Write the story for Benji and Sybelle . My mind raced forwards , to some cheerful and wholesome room , where we three would be gathered years hence I , Armand , unchanged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Benji grown into a sleek tall gentleman with an Arab 's ink-eyed allure and his favorite cheroot in his hand , a man of great expectation and opportunity , and my Sybelle , a curvaceous and full regal-bodied woman by then , and an even greater concert pianist than she could be now , her golden hair framing a woman 's oval face and fuller womanish lips and eyes full of entsagang and secret radiance . Could I dictate the story in this room and give them the book ? This book dictated to David Talbot ? Could I , as I set them free from my alchemical world , give them this book ? Go forth my children , with all the wealth and guidance I could bestow , and now this book I wrote so long ago for you with David . Yes , said my soul . Yet I turned , and ripped the black scalp of hair from my victim and stomped on it with a Rumpelstiltskin foot . David did n't flinch . Englishmen are so polite . " Very well , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His rooms were on the second floor , not far from where I 'd paused at the top of the staircase . What a change from the barren and unheated hallways ! He 'd made a library for himself and with tables and chairs . A brass bed was there , dry and clean . " These are her rooms , " he said . " Do n't you remember ? " " Dora , " I said . I breathed her scent suddenly . Why , it was all around me . But all her personal things were gone . These were his books , they had to be . They were new spiritual explorers Dannion Brinkley , Hilarion , Melvin Morse , Brian Weiss , Matthew Fox , the Urantia book . Add to this old texts Cassiodorus , St. Teresa of Avila , Gregory of Tours , the Veda , Talmud , Torah , Kama Sutra all in original tongues . He had a few obscure novels , plays , poetry . " Yes . " He sat down at the table . " I do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what to tell you . " " Ah , " he said . He took out his mechanical pen . He opened a notebook with startlingly white paper scored with fine green lines . " You will know what to tell me . " He looked up at me . I stood hugging myself , as it were , letting my head fall as if it could drop right off me and I would die . My hair fell long about me . I thought of Sybelle and Benjamin , my quiet girl and exuberant boy . " Did you like them , David , my children ? " I asked . " Yes , the first moment I saw them , when you brought them in . Everyone did . Everyone looked lovingly and respectfully at them . Such poise , such charm . I think we all dream of such confidants , faithful mortal companions of compelling grace , who are n't screaming mad . They love you , yet they are neither terrified nor entranced . " I did n't move . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my heart the swift , bold march of the Appassionata , those rumbling , incandescent waves of music , full of throbbing and brittle metal , Appassionata . Only it was in my head . No golden long-limbed Sybelle . " Light the candles that you have , " I said timidly . " Will you do that for me ? It would be sweet to have many candles , and look , Dora 's lace is hanging still on the windows , fresh and clean . I am a lover of lace , that is Brussels point de gaze , or very like it , yes , I 'm rather mad for it . " " Of course , I 'll light the candles , " he said . I had my back to him . I heard the sharp delicious crack of a small wooden match . I smelt it burn , and then came the liquid fragrance of the nodding wick , the curling wick , and the light rose upwards , finding the cypress boards of the stripped wooden ceiling above us . Another crack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light swelled and came down over me and fell just short of brightness along the shadowy wall . " Why did you do it , Armand ? " he said . " Oh , the Veil has Christ on it , in some form , no doubt of it , it did seem to be the Holy Veil of Veronica , and God knows , thousands of others believed it , yes , but why in your case , why ? It was blazingly beautiful , yes , I grant you that , Christ with His thorns and His blood , and His eyes gazing right at us , both of us , but why did you believe it so completely , Armand , after so long ? Why did you go to Him ? That 's what you tried to do , did n't you ? " I shook my head . I made my words soft and pleading . " Back up , scholar , " I said , turning around slowly . " Mind your page . This is for you , and for Sybelle . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way , it 's my symphony for Sybelle . The story begins a long time ago . Maybe I 've never truly realized how long ago , until this very moment . You listen and write . Let me be the one to cry and to rant and to rail . "
