<p> Steve Spurrier is n't a Kentucky nemesis . <p> He 's a scourge . <p> Fourteen times  --  first with Florida , then after settling back into the college game at South Carolina  --  the ball coach has drawn up a game plan , pulled on a headset and gone against the Wildcats . In 1994 , he beat them 73-7 . In 1996 , it was 65-0 . Only twice have his teams walked off the field with fewer than five touchdowns . <p> Never have they walked away winless . Bottom line , going into their 15th meeting , tonight in Columbia , S.C. : Spurrier 14 , the overmatched ' Cats 0 . <p> It 's the kind of baggage that accumulates in nearly a half-century of football mediocrity . The last time Kentucky put winning seasons back to back , a Bush had n't been elected president ( in 1983-84 ) . The Wildcats have claimed a single conference championship since Bear Bryant left their sideline . That title came 31 years ago , when it was shared with Georgia . <p> Spurrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 20 games dating to 1987 . <p> But these are days of blessed relief in the Commonwealth . " This team , " coach Rich Brooks says , " has taken some pride in trying to knock down some of those streaks and create a new image for Kentucky football . " <p> Unbeaten in five games , the awakened Wildcats take into tonight 's game their highest ranking since 1977  --  No.8 in the USA TODAY coaches and Associated Press media polls . ( They were No. 6 in the final AP poll of 1977 , but were on probation and ineligible for the coaches ' poll . ) They 're unlike any Kentucky team Spurrier or anybody in the modern Southeastern Conference has seen : fast , physical and deep , playing with a swagger born of fourth-quarter-comeback victories against Arkansas and then-No. 9-ranked Louisville . <p> Senior receiver Keenan Burton was in his car when his father , Ed , phoned with news of the ' Cats ' new top-10 ranking . He barely blinked . " That 's a good thing ... but to us it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along , " Burton says . " Why get excited about something that you knew you could do from the beginning ? " <p> Tough trio to beat <p> Tonight begins a 17-day , three-game stretch that will test that cool as well as Kentucky 's prospects as a serious player in one of college football 's toughest conferences . South Carolina , 4-1 and ranked 18th , will throw the nation 's second-rated pass defense at the Wildcats and Heisman Trophy-contending quarterback Andre Woodson . The next two weeks bring No.2 LSU and No. 7 Florida , the defending national champion , both in Lexington . <p> More baggage : The Wildcats have n't beaten any of the three since the calendar turned to 2000 . In seven games against the Gamecocks , four against the Tigers and seven against the Gators , Kentucky is 0-18 . <p> " We 've beat some of the teams we were supposed to beat , but it 's important that we compete with some of the teams we 're not supposed to beat , " says Burton , Woodson 's favorite receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do that , it shows we 're not the same Kentucky . " <p> This is n't a program without pedigree . George Blanda and Babe Parilli quarterbacked the ' Cats . Bryant and Blanton Collier coached them , the latter 's 1959 staff also featuring Don Shula , Bill Arnsparger and a former Kentucky All-American , Howard Schnellenberger . <p> But Collier 's was the last winning tenure . Eight coaches since 1961 have lost more than they won , some by a lot . In 54 years , Kentucky had as many years of NCAA probation ( six ) as bowl bids . <p> Brooks inherited stiff scholarship sanctions  --  the Wildcats were docked 19 over three years  --  from the latest infractions case when he arrived in December 2002 . That bought him little grace in the frustrated state . When he managed just four , two and three victories in his first three seasons , many in the Commonwealth dismissed him as yet another failure and screamed for a replacement . <p> In an increasingly quick-trigger era , Kentucky athletics director Mitch Barnhart stayed patient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1980s and ' 90s . " I knew if he had the support system around him , he was a very good football coach and that he would assemble the right people and do it the right way , " Barnhart says . " He 'd be methodical . It would n't be done with the style points some would like , but it would be done with great substance . <p> As the criticism mounted , Barnhart says , " I had several players come to me and say , ' Please give us a chance . We think we can get it turned around , and we believe in this staff . ' That meant a lot . So many times in today 's world , the players are coming in and say , ' We do n't like what we see . Please change it . ' These guys were doing the exact opposite : ' Hang in there . We 're getting closer . ' " <p> Wildcats boast high-powered offense <p> Last season bore them out . Kentucky finished 8-5 with a win against Clemson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 22 years . <p> With this season 's 5-0 start , the Wildcats  --  starting nine seniors and six juniors  --  have won 10 of their last 11 games . <p> Woodson , likened by Spurrier to former Heisman winner and Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer , is running the nation 's fifth-highest scoring offense . The defense has been suspect against the run but allowed just a 53% pass-completion rate and five TD passes . Nine players have come up with interceptions . <p> Schnellenberger , for one , has always seen the possibilities . A star offensive and defensive end , he played for teams that went 25-12-4 under Bryant and Collier . He returned to the state in the ' 80s , breathing life into Louisville 's program as head coach . <p> Now at Florida Atlantic , he got a firsthand look at the surging Wildcats in their 45-17 rout of FAU on Saturday . <p> " I 've always said that Kentucky is sitting in the best place in the world , same as Louisville is , " he says . " You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . ... Kids in the north think they 're going south to Kentucky , and kids in the south think they 're going north to Kentucky . It 's a beautiful campus , great school , wonderful people . So why not ? <p> " People make the difference . If they keep the right people there and support those people , there 's no reason why they ca n't start a winning tradition .
