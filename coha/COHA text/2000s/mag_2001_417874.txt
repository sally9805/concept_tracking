Meet four women who turned failure into success // The prospect of a failing enterprise can be enough to send some fledging business owners scurrying back to someone else 's payroll . But the serial entrepreneur is a breed apart . To her , a failing business is only a temporary setback . Such entrepreneur diehards stare down the dispiriting Small Business Administration statistic suggesting that only two-thirds of all small businesses are still open after two years . Instead , she counts on her company being among those that do last and go on to earn profits . But should a comeback queen 's business end up among the early casualities , she simply learns from the experience and supplies the knowledge to launching another . The business failure becomes the secret of her eventual success . Black women own 405,200 businesses in this country , a rise of 135 percent between 1987 and 1996 , according to the most recent statistics from the National Foundation for Women Business Owners . Comeback sagas are behind a small , but significant , number of Black women-owned start-ups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed last year , 5 percent said they had been self-employed before starting their current business . Experience shows that it can pay to keep on keeping on-the ultimate lesson each of the following sister entrepreneurs teach by example . The school of hard knocks taught Kearn Crockett Cherry , 35 , the cofounder and co-owner of three-year-old PRN HomeCare , in Biloxi , Mississippi , the value of precisely targeting her market and taking steps to capture customers ' attention . Strike one , strike two : In her first business , a multicultural gift shop in the Arizona desert town near the army base where her husband was stationed , Cherry felt she did n't have time to do any promotion . She was running the shop herself , working another job and completing classes for an associate 's degree in occupational therapy . Without store promotions , publicity or advertising , Cherry depended on foot traffic to bring in customers . But because her side-street location was out of the daily flow , few shoppers stumbled onto the store . So a year after Cherry opened it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her losses included original operating capital of $2,000 , plus $20,000 in inventory and store fixtures . By then , Cherry 's husband , Dennis , had left the army , and in late 1995 the couple moved back to their hometown , Biloxi , where one company hired them both as occupational therapists . In 1997 Cherry decided to start her own occupational-therapist staffing firm with $15,000 in family savings . But she closed this business , too , only a year later , incurring $25,000 in losses . She had marketed the firms services too narrowly , exclusively pursuing statewide contracts that never materialized . But Cherry says she was n't deterred . The third times a charm : Her third time out , Cherry used $15,000 in personal savings to start a home-care staffing company to provide nursing assistants and general companions for the elderly . She approached marketing like a zealot . " Marketing and networking are probably the biggest part of the business , " says the now market-savvy entrepreneur . Cherry spends a couple of days each week out of the office hunting for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join the company about two years ago , focuses on human-resource management . Last year PRN-which employs 20 ( many of them part-time caregivers ) grossed $180,000 . And having finally landed a contract from a statewide medical group to provide occupational therapists , Cherry expects revenues to double this year . Cultivating referral sources : Cherry understood immediately that securing referrals from one local hospital would require sustained effort . During the next year , she arranged a series of meetings with nurses and social workers on every floor of the hospital and in more than a dozen of its satellite centers . People wondered why she made so many return visits , but Cherry compares marketing to swimming like a shark : If you do n't move , she emphasizes , you will die . Indeed , the hospital eventually provided referrals for most of the company 's sales last year . Outsource and delegate : In her first business , Cherry tried to do too much on her own . " When you try to do everything , you run around in circles trying to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now she 's a born-again delegator and outsourcer .

Box 323 , Biloxi MS 39533 ; ( 228 ) 385-2603 ; prnstaf@aol.com . In the late 1980 's Houston resident Gwen Daye was struggling to keep both her business and her marriage afloat . Her medical  --  transcription firm was experiencing cashflow problems because the federal agencies who were her clients did not pay immediately . To make matters worse , her husband at the time was n't happy with her entrepreneurial aims . " If a woman has a passion for business , " Gwen Daye Richardson says now , " she needs to be single or have a very supportive spouse . Otherwise it does n't work . " In 1989 , she closed the business and divorced her husband . " I decided I wanted to change everything , " she says .

Willie Richardson became her boosted her business partner ( in publishing a conservative political newsletter targeted at African-Americans ) and , two years later , her husband . When she wrote an opinion piece that appeared in the Houston Chronicle , a potential investor contacted her with the offer to put $200,000 into her editorial product to turn it into a magazine , Headway . At its height , the magazine had 10,000 subscribers . " It was marginally profitable , but it never was going to make us wealthy , " Gwen Richardson , 43 , says . The Richardsons kept publishing it until 1998 . From these roots : That same year Richardson and her husband started Cushcity.com , an on-line retailer specializing in African-American books , videos , toys and Black Greek items .

When Cushcity.com went on-line in December 1998 , the couple sent out 500 E-mails announcing the launch . " We expected to get an order or two , " she says . Instead , they got 150 orders in three weeks . The typical order now averages $35 , says Richardson , and that figure doubles during the Christmas season . ( Some schools have even become regular customers , generating orders ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 each . ) Cushcity.com now has a bricks-and-mortar incarnation , a 2,200-square-foot space on the outskirts of Houston , which the Richardsons opened in September 2000 . All told the company expects to tote up $1.2 million in sales this year . The entrepreneurial urge : Gwen Richardson says that she hasri t worked for anyone other than herself in 17 years . She believes business failures are a rite of passage . " Most successful entrepreneurs learn from past mistakes or market changes , " she says .

Heather Brown , now 38 , tried two different approaches while struggling with her first business , the Center for Career Advancement . The firm , founded in 1990 , catered to Washington , D.C. , area professionals willing to pay to upgrade their resumes , cover letters and job-interview techniques . At the time , Brown was also employed as a small-business specialist at a local government economic development authority Get the right blueprint : Brown 's first problem lay in not foreseeing how many of the telephone contacts who set up face-to-face appointments with her would be no-shows . She had rented an office in which to meet her clients , because neither she nor her husband thought it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But with all the no-shows , she says , 11 every cent I was making was paying for that office .

Photograph Gwen Richardson , Cushcity.com // After a year Brown gave up the office space and followed her mother 's suggestion to take the business virtual . Back in the early 1990 's that meant using the fax and phone to conduct her interviews . " I ended up making more working by phone than when I was seeing clients in the office , and I was getting a better quality of client , " says Brown , who has an Ed.D. from Virginia Tech and an M.B.A . from George Mason University . But Brown found she missed the face-to  --  face contact . " I 'm a people person , " she says .
