THE HOUND AND THE JURY <P> Despite the fact that there were many funnier-looking dogs with even funnier-sounding names , the prize for best-in-show at the 127th annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show went to a Kerry blue terrier named TORUMS SCARF MICHAEL . The judges , who belong to that elite group of non-rappers who can say " bitch " a lot , chose Mick , as he 's known for short , over 2,602 other contestants , including a bichon frise named Paray 's I Told You So and a Newfoundland named Darbydale 's All Rise Pouchcove . Neither Mick nor his owner , Marilu Hansen , will get any prize money , but Mick will get to breed with lots of good-looking dogs . And is n't that its own reward ? <P> THE LADY AND THE TIGER <P> Why do they always want to play with the boys ? Golf megastar Annika Sorenstam won 13 out of 24 tournaments last year on her way to posting the lowest average score in LPGA history . Now she is turning her eyes to greener , er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Bank of America Colonial tournament in May , which will make her the first woman in more than 50 years to play in a PGA event . Sorenstam says she is " curious to see if she can compete . " But experts do n't foresee a Billie Jean King  --  style man-beating  --  Sorenstam will be driving from the men 's tees , which are about 10% longer than the women 's . A Top 10 finish is probably out of reach . But now that the athletic gender barrier is down , is it finally time for Dennis Rodman to try out for the WNBA ? <P> Did n't He Use to Be A Musician ? <P> Morbid fascination with MICHAEL JACKSON has eclipsed baseball and Yu-Gi-Oh ! as our national pastime . On Thursday Fox will air a new prime-time special that will include Jackson 's own footage of the fateful interviews with British journalist MARTIN BASHIR . ( Bashir reportedly praises Jackson 's parenting skills : " Your relationship with your kids is spectacular . " ) Meanwhile , on Monday night ABC will rerun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a special two-hour all-Jackson Dateline . Only CBS will stick to the relative moral high ground with such wholesome fare as 48 Hours Investigates , which will bring you an interview with a cosmetics heir who is on trial for date rape . <P> PLEASE , PLEASE PUT THESE SCENES ON THE DVD <P> Last November approximately 29 million viewers saw AARON BUERGE propose to schoolteacher HELENE EKSTEROWICZ on Fox 's The Bachelor . Over New Year 's , approximately nobody watched as they broke up . But theirs is not the most scandalous of behind-the-scenes Bachelor doings . The original , first-season Bachelor , Alex Michel , and his TV fiance , Amanda Marsh , have also called it quits . The reason ? During the show 's taping , Michel slept with  --  wait for it  --  TRISTA REHN , a runner-up to Marsh and current star of The Bachelorette . Even though Michel chose Marsh in the end , she told Inside Edition that Michel still had feelings for Rehn . This bothered Marsh so much that she decided to call things off .
