THE WEEK IT BEGAN // The year 1968 began the way any well-ordered year should-on a Monday morning . It was a leap year . February would have an extra day . The headline on the front page of The New York Times read , world bids adieu to a violent year ; city gets snowfall . // In Vietnam , 1968 had a quiet start . Pope Paul VI had declared January 1 a day of peace . For his day of peace , the pope had persuaded the South Vietnamese and their American allies to give a twelve-hour extension to their twenty-four-hour truce . The People 's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam , a pro-North Vietnamese guerrilla force in the South popularly known as the Viet Cong , announced a seventy-two-hour cease-fire . In Saigon , the South Vietnamese government had forced shop owners to display banners that predicted , " 1968 Will See the Success of Allied Arms . " // At the stroke of midnight in South Vietnam 's Mekong Delta , the church bells in the town of Mytho rang in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still ringing , a unit of Viet Cong appeared on the edge of a rice paddy and caught the South Vietnamese 2nd Marine Battalion by surprise , killing nineteen South Vietnamese marines and wounding another seventeen . // A New York Times editorial said that although the resumption of fighting had shattered hopes for peace , another chance would come with a cease-fire in February for Tet , the Vietnamese New Year . // " L'ann ? e 1968 , je la salue avec s ? r ? nit ? , " pronounced Charles de Gaulle , the tall and regal seventy-eight-year-old president of France , on New Year 's Eve . " I greet the year 1968 with serenity , " he said from his ornate palace where he had been governing France since 1958 . He had rewritten the constitution to make the president of France the most powerful head of state of any Western democracy . He was now three years into his second seven-year term and saw few problems on the horizon . From a gilded palace room , addressing French television-whose only two channels were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning to him and that he would be able to broker peace in not only Vietnam but also the Middle East . " All signs indicate , therefore , that we shall be in a position to contribute most effectively to international solutions . " In recent years he had taken to referring to himself as " we . " // As he gave his annual televised message to the French people , the man the French called the General or Le Grand Charles seemed " unusually mellow , almost avuncular , " sparing harsh adjectives even for the United States , which of late he had been calling " odious . " His tone contrasted with that of his 1967 New Year 's message , when he had spoken of " the detestable unjust war " in Vietnam in which a " big nation " was destroying a small one . The French government had grown concerned at the level of animosity that France 's allies had been directing at it . // France was enjoying a quiet and prosperous moment . After World War II , the Republic had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaulle seemed to have forgotten . Ho Chi Minh , America 's enemy , had been born under French colonial rule the same year as de Gaulle and had spent most of his life fighting the French . He had once lived in Paris under the pseudonym Nguyen O Phap , which means " Nguyen who hates the French . " During World War II , Franklin Roosevelt had warned de Gaulle that after the war France should give Indochina its independence . But de Gaulle told Ho , even as he was enlisting his people in the fight against the Japanese , that after the war he intended to reestablish the French colony . Roosevelt argued , " The people of Indochina are entitled to something better than that . " De Gaulle was determined that his Free French troops participate in any action in Indochina , saying , " French bloodshed on the soil of Indochina would constitute an impressive territorial claim . " // After World War II , the French fought Ho for Vietnam and suffered bitter defeat . Then they fought and lost in Algeria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy was growing , despite de Gaulle 's notorious lack of interest in the fine points of economics . Between the end of the Algerian war and 1967 , real wages in France rose 3.6 percent each year . There was a rapid increase in the acquisition of consumer goods-especially cars and televisions . And there was a dramatic increase in the number of young people attending universities . // De Gaulle 's prime minister , Georges Pompidou , anticipated few problems for the year ahead . He predicted that the Left would be more successful in unifying than they would in actually taking power . " The opposition will harass the government this year , " the prime minister announced , " but they will not succeed in provoking a crisis . " // The popular weekly Paris Match placed Pompidou on a short list of politicians who would maneuver in 1968 to try to replace the General . Yet the editors predicted there would be more to watch abroad than in France . " The United States will unleash one of the fiercest electoral battles ever imagined , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential hot spots as a fight over gold and the dollar , growing freedom in the Soviet Union 's Eastern satellite countries , and the launching of a Soviet space weapons system . // " It is impossible to see how France today could be paralyzed by crisis as she has been in the past , " said de Gaulle in his New Year 's message . // Paris had never looked brighter , thanks to Culture Minister Andr ? Malraux 's building-cleaning campaign . The Madeleine , the Arc de Triomphe , the Pantheon , and other landmark buildings were no longer gray and charcoal but beige and buff , and this month cold-water sprays were going to remove seven hundred years of grime from Notre Dame Cathedral . It was one of the great controversies of the moment in the French capital . Would the water spray damage the building ? Would it look oddly patchwork , revealing that not all the stones were originally of matching color ? // De Gaulle , seated in his palace moments before midnight on the eve of 1968 , was serene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries shaken by confusion , " he promised , " ours will continue to give an example of order . " France 's " primordial aim " in the world is peace , the General said . " We have no enemies . " // Perhaps this new Gaullian tone was influenced by dreams of a Nobel Peace Prize . Paris Match asked Pompidou if he agreed with some of the General 's inner circle who had expressed outrage that de Gaulle had not already received the prize . But Pompidou answered , " Do you really think that the Nobel Prize could be meaningful to the General ? The General is only concerned about history , and no jury can dictate the judgment of history . " // Aside from de Gaulle , the American computer industry struck one of the new year 's rare notes of optimism , predicting a record year for 1968 . In the 1950s computer manufacturers had estimated that six computers could serve the needs of the entire United States . By January 1968 fifty thousand computers were operating in the country , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cigarette industry was also optimistic that its 2 percent growth in sales in 1967 would be repeated in 1968 . The executive of one of the leading cigarette manufacturers boasted , " The more they attack us the higher our sales go . " // But by most measurements , 1967 had not been a good year in the United States . A record number of violent , destructive riots had erupted in black inner cities across the country , including Boston , Kansas City , Newark , and Detroit . // 1968 would be the year in which " Negroes " became " blacks . " In 1965 , Stokely Carmichael , an organizer for the remarkably energetic and creative civil rights group the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , or SNCC , invented the name Black Panthers , soon followed by the phrase Black Power . At the time , black , in this sense , was a rarely used poetic turn of phrase . The word started out in 1968 as a term for black militants , and by the end of the year it became the preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to those who would not stand up for themselves . // On the second day of 1968 , Robert Clark , a thirty-seven-year-old schoolteacher , took his seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives without a challenge , the first black to gain a seat in the Mississippi State Legislature since 1894. // But in the civil rights struggle , action was shifting from the soft-spoken rural South to the hard-edged urban North . Northern blacks were different from blacks in the South . While the mostly southern followers of Martin Luther King , Jr. , studied Mohandas Gandhi and his nonviolent anti-British campaign , Stokely Carmichael , who had grown up in New York City , became interested in violent rebels such as the Mau Mau , who had risen up against the British in Kenya . Carmichael , a good-humored man with a biting wit and a sense of theater that he brought from his native Trinidad , had been for years regularly jailed , threatened , and abused in the South , as had all the SNCC workers . And during those years there were always moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurling back abuse verbally and sometimes physically , confronting segregationists who harassed him . The King people chanted , " Freedom now ! " The Carmichael people chanted , " Black Power ! " King tried to persuade Carmichael to use the slogan " Black Equality " rather than " Black Power , " but Carmichael kept his slogan . // Increasing numbers of black leaders wanted to fight segregation with segregation , imposing a black-only social order that at least paid lip service to excluding even white reporters from press briefings . In 1966 Carmichael became head of SNCC , replacing John Lewis , a soft-spoken southerner who advocated nonviolence . Carmichael turned SNCC into an aggressive Black Power organization , and in so doing Black Power became a national movement . In May 1967 Hubert " Rap " Brown , who had not been a well-known figure in the civil rights movement , replaced Carmichael as the head of SNCC , which by now was nonviolent in name only . In that summer of bloody riots , Brown said at a press conference , " I say you better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cherry pie . " // King was losing control over a badly divided civil rights movement in which many believed nonviolence had outlived its usefulness . 1968 seemed certain to be the year of Black Power , and the police were readying themselves . By the beginning of 1968 most American cities were preparing for war-building up their arsenals , sending undercover agents into black neighborhoods like spies into enemy territory , recruiting citizenry as a standing reserve army . The city of Los Angeles , where thirty-four people had been killed in an August 1965 riot in the Watts section , was contemplating the purchase of bulletproof armored vehicles , each of which could be armed with a .30-caliber machine gun ; a choice of smoke screen , tear gas , or fire-extinguishing launchers ; and a siren so loud it was said to disable rioters . " When I look at this thing , I think , My God , I hope we 'll never have to use it , " said Los Angeles deputy chief Daryl Gates , " but then I realize how valuable it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect us from sniper fire when we tried to rescue our wounded officers . " Such talk had become good politics since California governor Pat Brown had been defeated the year before by Ronald Reagan , largely because of the Watts riots . The problem was that the vehicles cost $35,000 each . The Los Angeles Sheriff 's Office had a more cost-effective idea-a surplus army M-8 armored car for only $2,500. // In Detroit , where forty-three people died in race riots in 1967 , the police already had five armored vehicles but were stockpiling tear gas and gas masks and were requesting antisniper rifles , carbines , shotguns , and 150,000 rounds of ammunition . One Detroit suburb had purchased an army half-track-a quasi tank . The city of Chicago purchased helicopters for its police force and started training 11,500 policemen in using heavy weapons and crowd control techniques in preparation for the year 1968 . From the outset of the year , the United States seemed to be run by fear . // On January 4 , thirty-four-year-old playwright LeRoi Jones , an outspoken Black Power advocate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the New Jersey State Penitentiary and fined $1,000 for illegal possession of two revolvers during the Newark riots the previous summer . In explaining why he had imposed the maximum sentence , Essex County judge Leon W. Kapp said that he suspected Jones was " a participant in formulating a plot " to burn Newark on he night he was arrested . Decades later , known as Amiri Baraka , Jones became the poet laureate of New Jersey . // In Vietnam , the war U.S. officials were forever telling correspondents was about to end still seemed far from over . // When the French had left in 1954 , Vietnam was divided into a North Vietnam ruled by Ho Chi Minh , who had largely controlled the region anyway , and a South Vietnam left in the hands of anti-communist factions . By 1961 the Northern communists had gained control of half the territory of South Vietnam through the Viet Cong , which met with little resistance from the Southern population . That year the North began sending troops of their regular army south along what became known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. responded with increased involvement though it had always been involved-in 1954 the U.S. had been financing an estimated four-fifths of the cost of the French war effort . In 1964 with North Vietnam 's position steadily strengthening , Johnson had used an alleged naval attack in the Gulf of Tonkin as the pretext for open warfare . From that point on , the Americans expanded their military presence each year . // In 1967 , 9,353 Americans were killed in Vietnam , more than doubling the total number of Americans previously killed , which now stood at 15,997 , with another 99,742 Americans wounded . Newspapers ran weekly hometown casualty reports . And the war was also taking a toll on the economy , at a cost of an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion a month . During the summer , President Johnson had asked for a large tax increase to stanch the growing debt . The Great Society , the massive social spending program that Johnson had begun as a memorial to his fallen predecessor , was dying from lack of funds . A book published at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Failure of American Liberalism contended that the Great Society and liberalism itself were dying . //
