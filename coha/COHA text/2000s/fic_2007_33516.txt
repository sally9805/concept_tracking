Somewhere in the Dark eastern woods Once upon a time , long ago , near the Land of Stories , lived young Tom Trueheart . He was the youngest of the famous Trueheart family of adventurers . He lived far away from here , and even further from now , in a carved and painted wooden house near a busy crossroads , on the edge of a deep dark forest , in the time of fables . He lived with his kindly mother and with his six older brothers . Tom 's six older brothers were all named Jack , after Jack , their father . Their nicknames were Simple Jack , Jack-a-Napes , Jack the Giant Killer , Jack Sprat , or Jack-a-Dandy . These Jacks were well known and celebrated throughout the land . Jack , Jacquot , Jacques , Jackie , Jackson , and Jake were very tall , very beefy , very brave , and very noisy young men . On the occasions when they were all at home together , the little wooden house was so noisy , and so crowded with Jacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these six brothers were famous for a very good reason . It was these brave brothers , these same six , fabled , heroic Jacks who had carried out all of the toughest , scariest , and most romantic and exciting adventures so far to have happened in the Land of Stories . All of the great stories had happened to a Jack . Over the years , the youngest son , Tom Trueheart , had grown into an imaginative , kind , and helpful boy.He was not tall or broad for his age , as all his brothers had been ; he was slight and wiry . His hair was dark and curled naturally , while all his brothers had hair that was straight and worn long like a Viking warrior 's . Tom 's hair was hard to tame , and , on the rare occasions when he would let her , his mother had a devil of a time trying to brush it at all . His hair curled around his head in such wild and springy locks that he looked permanently windswept . His eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue of his father and brothers . From the earliest age he had suffered from bad dreams after listening to all the scary adventure stories of his older brothers . Dreams of wolves waiting in the darkest parts of the forest with big teeth and dripping jaws . Dreams of ogres and giants and dark dungeons and black-cloaked , smiling villains . Even when there was just Tom and his mother and they had a rare quiet evening on their own together , she would insist that they huddle cozily side by side in the inglenook fireplace ( the kind you can actually sit inside ) , and she could n't resist telling him one or two of the old and really scary stories . Stories , after all , were the family trade . . . . There was just one thing : Tom carried in his heart a worrying secret . A secret he kept locked up very tight inside . He was not like his bigger brothers in one other very important way . He was not at all brave .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
