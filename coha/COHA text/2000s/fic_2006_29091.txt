Far-Flung Adventures : Corby Flood By Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell Random House Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell Chapter 1 . The Saddest Song It 's quiet and dark here , and the forest floor sways and rolls beneath my feet . Sometimes I stumble , but I do not fall over , because I 'm trapped inside this tree where it is always dark . Oh , how I long to see the sun again . How did I get here ? I can hardly remember . . . Ah , yes , that 's it . I followed my tongue . The sweet petals tasted so good , melting in my mouth , until I walked into this tree and got trapped inside . Now there is no more sun . Just quiet and darkness and swaying . I feel so sad . My heart is so full of sadness that it must surely break . . . I will sing to let the sadness out . Perhaps if I sing , the forest will stop rolling and swaying , and the sun will come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just yet . The S.S. Euphonia , ablaze with twinkling lights , glided across a moonlit sea . Its funnels were topped with streams of frothy white smoke , its gleaming sides peppered with brightly lit portholes and its decks thronged with glamorous promenaders , taking the air and watching the stars . It was all so wonderful . So magical . . . Corby Flood reached up and touched the glass that protected the faded poster . She traced the lettering in the starry sky above the beautiful ship with a finger . ' The S.S. Euphonia , ' she read . ' " Empress of the Seas " .

' Corby 's grip tightened on the battered leatherbound book she was clutching under her arm . ' Why , if it is n't one of those Hoffendinck 's Guides , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belvedere standing before her . The captain  --  never cheerful at the best of times  --  was looking gloomier than ever . With his sagging skin and drooping moustache , he looked like nothing so much as a disappointed walrus . ' Did n't think we had any of those left on board , ' he said . ' After all , it 's not as if the poor old Euphonia stops anywhere interesting any more . In fact she does n't stop anywhere at all any more ! Dandoon to Harbour Heights non-stop , and back again . . . ' His voice was low , lugubrious and tinged with regret . ' More 's the pity . ' He sighed . ' Hauling cargo is all the old " Empress of the Seas " and I are fit for . That , and the odd passenger or two who ca n't afford anything better . . . ' He looked Corby up and down somewhat disapprovingly . ' Well , I think she 's a lovely ship , ' said Corby . ' And after Father 's great disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she swallowed hard . ' Mother says we 've got to learn to make the best of things and try to stay cheerful . ' And she gave the captain what she hoped was a meaningful stare . ' Yes , well , ahem . . . ' The captain turned away . ' Sometimes that 's easier said than done , little girl . Especially when the bilge pump has broken and your first and your second engineers have left for better jobs . ' He cast a gloomy eye over the chipped paintwork , rusty railings and scuffed decking of the old ship . ' Still , that 's only to be expected when hardly anything works any more , ' he went on . ' The automatic parasols , the self-adjusting railings , the moving windbreaks . . . ' He gestured about him in a wide arc . ' The Euphonia 's only fit for the scrapheap , ' hemuttered , shaking his head . ' Just like me ! ' ' Good news , Captain , ' came a smooth , polished voice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first officer Lieutenant Jon-Jolyon Letchworth- Crisp standing there , a suave smile on his lips . ' Arthur 's managed to fix the bilge pump , ' he said . ' At least , for the time being . . . ' ' Good news ? ' said Captain Belvedere . ' If you say so , Letchworth- Crisp , if you say so . . . ' The captain turned and walked slowly away . ' I 'll be in my cabin if you need me , ' he added gloomily . ' Though why anybody should need me , I do n't know . . . ' Jon-Jolyon turned to Corby and flashed a brittle smile . ' And how is young Miss Corby Flood today ? ' he asked . ' Fine , thanks , ' said Corby . ' And your delightful mother and father ? ' ' Also fine . ' ' And your four energetic brothers ? ' Corby nodded . They both knew that there was only one person in the Flood family he was truly interested in . ' The same as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so is my enchanting older sister , Serena . ' Jon-Jolyon grinned . ' Glad to hear it . Do give her my very best regards , wo n't you ? ' he said , as he turned on his heels and strode off . ' And I hope we shall all meet up at dinner , ' he called back over his shoulder . Corby smiled  --  a smile which faded the moment she was sure the lieutenant had gone . She opened Hoffendinck 's Guide and , taking the pencil that dangled on a piece of string around her neck , she started writing . . . H O F F E N D I N C K ' S G U I D E THE HERMIT ISLANDS These tiny crags , several hundred in number , were occupied by hermit fishermen for many years and are ideal for an afternoon picnic if passing . Consult the captain for details of tides , and always have a stout rowing boat at the ready in case of emergencies . Some of the more interesting islands are : Mortimer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mermaid so hideous that she is said to frighten fishermen to death with one look . Stefan 's Pile  --  covered in soft , grey sea-moss up to five feet thick , and home to eider crabs . The Old Man of Fub  --  famous for its nesting colony of blue-tailed goobies . Well worth a visit . SIGHTS TO LOOK OUT FOR : De Witt 's Moonlight Flying Fish ; a.k.a . Love Fish  --  on moonlit nights , these extraordinary fish can be seen swimming in large shoals close to the surface of the ocean . As the moonlight glints on the tops of the waves , the love fish engage in elaborate displays , leaping into the air in graceful arcs . Legend has it that any who witness the flight of the love fish fall instantly in love . NOTES Corby stopped writing for a moment and gazed reflectively out to sea . How strange , she thought , to be writing notes about the people she met on board , instead of notes about the interesting places mentioned in Hoffendinck 's Guide . When they boarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect of all the fascinating sights she would see on her voyage home to Harbour Heights  --  not that Corby could call Harbour Heights ' home ' exactly . The only home she had ever known was the large white bungalow in Dandoon where she had been born eight years earlier . And as for the sights , it was n't long before Corby had discovered that the closest she would ever get was peering at them on the distant horizon as the ship sailed past . Still , at least she could read all about them in the guide . She squinted at a tiny black speck on the horizon . Was that Mortimer 's Crag ? she wondered . Or Stefan 's Pile ? But she was too far away even to make a guess , she realized with a sigh . At that moment Corby heard the sound of low muttering and shuffling footsteps coming up the stairs from the cabins below her . Uh-oh , she thought , snapping shut Hoffendinck 's Guide . It 's the Hattenswillers ! Mr and Mrs Hattenswiller appeared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conical hats with ear flaps , and matching ankle-length coats with lots of pockets . Whenever she met them , Mr Hattenswiller would click his heels together and nod at Corby politely , while Mrs Hattenswiller would smile , and the pair of them never failed to exchange greetings . And that was where the problem lay  --  for no matter how hard she listened , Corby could never , ever , make out what they were saying . Sometimes Mr Hattenswiller would speak , and his wife would smile knowingly as though he had just said the cleverest thing . But Corby had heard only a mumbled murmur . And sometimes Mrs Hattenswiller would say something , and her husband would nod vigorously in agreement . But again , Corby had heard nothing but a quiet whisper . Once , taking a chance , she 'd replied that she was ' very well , thank you '  --  but both Hattenswillers had looked at her as if she were mad . His eyebrows had shot upwards , her smile had frozen , and the pair of them had continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , Corby could n't hear properly . No , far better all round if she avoided them , she thought , as she scooted through the side door and onto the starboard deck .
