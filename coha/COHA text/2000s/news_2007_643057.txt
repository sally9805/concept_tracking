<p> When Queen Elizabeth needs groceries , her staff usually sends out to Fortnum &; Mason . Household goods at Buckingham Palace often come from the Selfridges department store . And the tea poured at royal tea parties is likely to have been blended by R. Twining &; Company . <p> These three companies fall into the large corporate basket of the Weston family , as close to Canadian royalty as anyone here comes . The royal warrants granted those companies proclaim : " by appointment to HM The Queen . " <p> Indeed , if the queen has any complaints about her purchases , she could just call on Prince Charles , who is a polo partner and friend of W. Galen Weston , the scion of the family . <p> But these days , the focus of the Weston family , whose food company holdings span the entire industry and much of the world , is sliding fast from the heights of British nobility and Buckingham Palace to the level of ordinary Canadians  --  and to Bentonville , Ark . The foundation of the fortune that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Companies , Canada 's largest grocery chain and once one of North America 's most innovative retailers . <p> Now , Wal-Mart Stores is moving into groceries in Canada , and Loblaw has lost its way . On March 15 , the company reported a loss of 219 million Canadian dollars for 2006 ( $190.3 million ) . That was its first annual loss in 19 years . <p> Last year , a botched attempt at improving its distribution systems left shelves empty in many of the chain 's 1,100 stores , with inventory pile-ups at its 26 warehouses.The company has recently introduced food products that have not been a hit with shoppers , and its new nonfood items have fared even worse , leading to a write-down in inventories in December of 120 million Canadian dollars . In January , its expansion in Quebec through the purchase of a regional grocery chain resulted in a further write-down of nearly 900 million Canadians dollars . <p> The task of preparing investors for the recent run of bad news fell to Galen G. Weston , 34 , who succeeded his father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In late February , the younger Mr. Weston addressed analysts at Toronto 's former hockey shrine , Maple Leaf Gardens , which is to become a Loblaw superstore . <p> " We need to improve virtually every key driver of the business , " Mr. Weston said . " We have not been focused on our core strength of being the best food retailer in Canada . Our organization is too complex and is ineffective and slow to respond to the customer and to the competitive environment . " <p> Various Loblaw executives presented analysts with candid PowerPoint presentations that included snapshots of chaotic Loblaw stock rooms that would be straightened out . Mr. Weston then reminded them that his family had saved the company once before . <p> At that time , 34 years ago , Mr. Weston 's father was about the same age as the younger Mr. Weston is now , when he became head of the chain . The situation back then was far worse than today . One consultant then even suggested that the family , which has been in the food business since 1882 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling the real estate . <p> " One of the reasons that the family has been successful is because we 're prepared to take very tough decisions , very difficult decisions that may impact the short-term performance of an organization , to make sure that it is successful for the long term , " Mr. Weston told the crowd . <p> The earlier turnaround of Loblaw owed a great deal to Dave Nichol , a college roommate of the older Mr. Weston who was working as a consultant at McKinsey &; Company . Mr. Nichol left Loblaw in December 1993 to start a private brand consulting business , Dave Nichol &; Associates , but he remains in touch with the family . Today , when Mr. Nichol visits a Loblaw 's outlet , he finds little to praise . <p> " It 's a sad shadow of its former self , " Mr. Nichol said of the situation . He blames bad advice from the senior management team that was recently purged , as well as the older Mr. Weston 's being distracted by Selfridges , which he acquired in 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Nichol said . " Giorgio Armani is more interesting than Kraft dinner . " <p> The essential innovation introduced by Mr. Nichol that helped the previous turnaround was to transform its house brands into premium brands under the name President 's Choice . <p> It was a strategy that involved seasonal magazine-style fliers  --  their advertising pitches written by Mr. Nichol himself  --  to promote the President 's Choice offerings . A large internal staff also created , among other things , a chocolate chip cookie with more chocolate than anything on the market . <p> It was also immensely profitable . Before President 's Choice , Mr. Nichol said that coffee sold at Loblaw stores produced about a 10 percent gross margin for the retailer . After the new house brand appeared , including a heavily promoted blend made with an unusual decaffeination process , the entire category 's margin rose to 35 percent . <p> " You 'd kill your mother for a tenth of a point in this business , so that was big news , " Mr. Nichol said . <p> Loblaw eventually expanded its President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailers in 22 countries , including Jewel-Osco , a grocery chain in the United States . ( The Westons , through a publicly traded holding company , George Weston , are a major presence in baking in the United States , where their brands include Entenmann 's , Freihofer 's , Thomas ' , Stroehmann and Arnold . ) <p> With Wal-Mart 's expansion into the Canadian grocery market , Loblaw 's previous management decided it was time for another change . The execution of that plan , however , did not run as smoothly as the moves during the Nichol era . <p> The company , Mr. Nichol and many others argue , mistakenly tried to respond to Wal-Mart by becoming more like Wal-Mart . Loblaw stores were known for attractive , inviting designs . But after reaching a wage concession with its unions , Loblaw began building a new group of stores under the Real Canadian Superstore banner that are mostly notable for their Wal-Mart-like vastness . <p> More problematic , however , were the new nonfood products that filled the increased floor space . John Chamberlain , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said that leading retailers in Europe had demonstrated that expanding beyond food is an effective tool for fending off Wal-Mart . And Loblaw itself had achieved success in parts of Western Canada with general merchandise . <p> But when the televisions , flashlights , air-conditioners , arm chairs , camping gear and small appliances began rolling into Loblaw stores in the central Ontario market , few of them went out the door in customers ' shopping carts . <p> Mr. Chamberlain attributes that to several factors . Not only was Loblaw unable to match the prices of Wal-Mart , many of its nonfood offerings put the stores directly in competition with other aggressive and successful retailers , including Canadian Tire of Toronto which , despite its name , offers a wide array of nonautomotive products . <p> " They 've got to find a niche away from Wal-Mart , just like Target did , " Mr. Chamberlain said . " There 's no oxygen trying to be cheaper than them . " <p> At the same time , the move into general merchandise and the bungled warehouse revamping led Loblaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it promoted new high-profit house brand items . <p> That loss of direction came at a bad time . Other Canadian grocers like Sobeys , a chain of 1,296 stores , and Metro in Montreal , which is not connected to the German retailer of the same name and which also sells under the A &P; name in Canada , were building up their private-label businesses to compete with Loblaw . They were also making a successful push into prepared foods , an area Loblaw had neglected . <p> To perhaps everyone 's relief , Mr. Weston told the investment meeting that food would again be Loblaw 's focus . Correspondingly , the company will narrow its efforts in nonfood products and concentrate on a line of inexpensive clothing sold under the Joe Fresh brand . <p> Mr. Weston later pleaded with the analysts to stay for the fashion show : " Sit down ; sit down , " he said . " I know some of you are not superkeen on Joe Fresh , but we 're going to give you a hint of what we can do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not publicity seekers , have relatively high public profiles in Canada . His Irish-born mother , Hilary M. Weston , was Ontario 's lieutenant governor , Queen Elizabeth 's official representative , for six years . During that time , the elder Mr. Weston gamely attended the public building openings and community events that came with his wife 's position . <p> Until his appointment to Loblaw 's top spot , the younger Mr. Weston , who is sometimes called G2 , was mostly known for establishing the Spoke Club , a private club in Toronto , in 2004 with a partner and his sister , Allanah , who is now the creative director of Selfridges . <p> While the Spoke Club originally catered to members of the city 's arts and cultural communities , its current membership appears to be mostly made up of young professionals . <p> Mr. Weston previously held a variety of nonsenior jobs at Loblaw . One fact , however , has already set him apart from John Lederer , who was removed as president in September on the same day that Mr. Weston was promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid 22 million Canadian dollars , including severance , outstanding pay and bonuses when he was removed from office . Mr. Weston , however , has agreed that he is not entitled to any severance payments , and he can be dismissed by the company at any time , for any reason . <p> But as Mr. Weston tries to work the family 's healing magic on Loblaw again , he will be closely watched by his father , who remains chairman and president of the family holding company , which is also the largest Loblaw shareholder . <p> For Mr. Nichol , Mr. Weston 's success or failure will most likely hinge on the advice he receives from the executives who surround him , many of them from department stores . <p> Mr. Nichol also suggested the factor that saved the company from its near collapse in the 1970s was also likely to be in play again : " Pride , " Mr. Nichol said . " The Westons have really always been the biggest food people in Canada . And they did n't want to see the business go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
