The brandy had been absolutely essential . It always was on Sunday nights , when Sister Ignatius took it upon herself to cook and serve Father Newberry a " proper meal . " In this part of Wisconsin , that usually translated to hamburger cooked in canned cream soup . The shape varied with the good sister 's whims-sometimes meatballs , sometimes meat loaf , and on one memorable occasion , rolled tubes that looked disturbingly like a casserole of severed penises-but the basic ingredients and the resulting indigestion were always the same . Father Newberry had learned long ago that antacids could n't touch it . Only the brandy helped , blessing him with a quick sleep where he passed the time in happy oblivion while his stomach fought the demons of Sister Ignatius 's kindness . On this particular Sunday night the demons had been multiple . In some sort of aspiring gourmet fit the sister had baked meat loaf in God only knew how many different kinds of canned soups . When he 'd asked her to name the ingredients of this daring culinary experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips with an imaginary key . " Ah , a secret recipe . " He had smiled at her rosy face , greatly fearing that clam chowder lurked somewhere in the ocean of oily liquid in which the meat loaf had drowned . And so it was that the juice glass had been filled with brandy for an unprecedented second time , and Father Newberry had fallen fast asleep in the recliner facing the television . When he next opened his eyes , the screen was a snowfield of jittery flakes hissing static , and the clock face read five a.m . When he went to turn off the lamp by the window , he saw the frosty car in the church lot and recognized it immediately . It was a Ford Falcon of indeterminate age , dying slowly of the cancerous rust that devoured old cars in a state that salted roads as liberally as they salted food . In a moment of weakness , he wished he could just sneak off to his warm bed and pretend he 'd never seen it . His only sin was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , tugging his cardigan close around his abused belly before stepping out into the dark chill of an October morning . The church was old and almost Protestant in its plainness , for these rural Wisconsin Catholics eyed all things magnificent with deep suspicion . The Blessed Virgin wore the gleam of plastic and bore an unsaintly resemblance to the mannequin in the window of Frieda 's House of Fashion on Main Street , and the only stained glass window was oddly placed on the north side , where the sun could never set it afire with brilliant color that might offend . A dour place in a dour parish in a dour state , thought Father Newberry , missing the California of his youth , nearly forty years gone now , speculating again that all bad priests were sent to Wisconsin . John and Mary Kleinfeldt were kneeling in a middle pew , heads resting on folded hands , utterly still in a devotion the Father had always thought almost obsessive . It was not unusual for the aging couple to visit the church during off-hours-sometimes he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed corrupt with sin . But to the best of his knowledge , they had never come so early . It did not bode well for a rapid return to the cozy rectory , and Father Newberry was loath to ask what trouble had brought them here this time , since he already knew the answer . He sighed and moved slowly down the aisle , reluctantly propelled by a sense of duty and a good heart . " Good morning , John . Good morning , Mary , " he would say . " What troubles you today ? " And then they would tell him they had discovered yet another homosexual in his congregation-a man whose lashes were too long or a woman whose voice was too deep , for this was proof enough for them . It was n't simply homophobia ; it was a zealous crusade against what they called the " abhorrent , unnatural offense to God 's eye , " and listening to their self-righteous accusations always left him feeling sad and somehow soiled . Please let it be something else this time , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have , after all , already endured the penance of good Sister Ignatius 's meat loaf . And indeed it was something else . What was troubling John and Mary Kleinfeldt this morning was not the suspected presence of homosexuals in the parish , but the indisputable presence of small , tidy bullet holes in the backs of their skulls . CHAPTER 2 It was n't the first homicide in Kingsford County since Sheriff Michael Halloran had pinned on his star five years ago . Scatter a few thousand people over the northern Wisconsin countryside , arm a good half of them with hunting rifles and skinning knives , throw a hundred bars into the mix , and eventually some of them are going to end up killing each other . That 's just the way it was . It did n't happen very often , and for the most part they were the kind of killings people up here could get their heads around : bar fights , domestics , and the occasional suspicious hunting accident , like when Harry Patrowski said he shot his mother through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But an old couple gunned down in a church ? Now that was something else , something senseless and evil that was n't supposed to happen in a little town where kids played outside after dark , nobody locked their doors , and corn wagons still lumbered down Main Street on their way to the feed mill . Hell , half the people in the county thought smoking a joint meant lighting your elbow on fire , and you still had to drive ninety miles south and east to Green Bay just to see an " R " movie . This murder was going to change everything . Four of the five squad cars on third watch were already in St. Luke 's parking lot by the time Halloran arrived at six a.m . Great , he thought . I 've got one car left on the road patrolling over eight hundred square miles of county . He saw Doc Hanson 's ugly blue station wagon sandwiched between two of the squads , and off in a corner , an ancient Ford Falcon in an ominous rectangle of yellow crime-scene tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited on the top step , tugging at a belt that had no hope of ever again making it up to his belly button . " Bonar , that holster hangs much lower you 're going to have to kneel if you ever need to get at your weapon . " " And I 'd still beat you at the draw , " Bonar grinned , which was true . " Man , you 're ugly this early . Good thing you do n't work the third . You 'd scare the other boys . " " Just tell me you 've solved this already so I can go back home to bed . " " Way I figure , Father Newberry did it . Forty years of listening to confessions and sniffing incense and then one day , poor bastard just snaps and shoots two of his parishioners in the back of the head . " " I 'm going to tell him you said that . " Bonar stuffed his fat hands into his jacket pockets and snorted a frosty exhale , serious now . " He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the TV after dinner , did n't even know Kleinfeldts were here until he looked out the window at five a.m. and saw their car . Went over to see if he could help , found the bodies , dialed 911 , end of story . " " Neighbors ? " " We 're working on it . " " So what 's your take on it ? " It was n't an idle question . Bonar might look and talk and act like another good old Wisconsin boy , but there were some scary processing chips in that head of his . He could take one look at a crime scene and tell you things the state forensics boys would never find with all their fancy equipment . He and Bonar had both done a year-long stint in Milwaukee right out of the academy before hustling back home and jumping into county uniforms . They 'd seen a lot in that city they were still trying to forget , but they 'd learned a lot , too . Bonar sucked at the inside of his cheek for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caterpillars . " Actually , it looks like a hit , which makes about as much sense as the padre doing it . I do n't know . My gut tells me psycho , but it seems too clean for that . " He pushed open the heavy wooden doors . A lifetime of conditioning made Halloran 's hand twitch as he passed the font of holy water , but it was only a twitch , the last contraction of a dying thing . Father Newberry was sitting in a back pew , motionless , tiny , old . Halloran touched his shoulder as he walked up the aisle , felt the answering brush of dry fingertips on his . Two deputies were stringing yellow crime-scene tape from pew to pew in a terrible parody of the white satin ribbon draped for a wedding . Two others were on their hands and knees with flashlights , searching the floor . Doc Hanson was crouched sideways in the narrow space between the Kleinfeldts and the pew in front of them , eyes and hands busy with the dead , oblivious to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Halloran circled the scene slowly , letting it imprint on his mind . There was something wrong with it ; something a little off-kilter about the bodies , dancing at the edge of his consciousness , just out of reach . " Just from the rigor , four hours , give or take , " Doc Hanson said without being asked , without looking up . " I 'll check the temps when I 'm ready to move them . Harris , give me one of your bags . I got a hair here . " Long gone , Halloran thought , moving out of the way , back down the aisle toward Father Newberry . Whoever did this could be in New York by now , or California , or next door . * * * * * " So everybody hated them . " " I did n't say that , Mikey . " " Father , meaning no offense , but could you not call me Mikey when I 'm on the job ? " " Sorry . It slipped out . " Father Newberry smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely admit he loved like a son in a very human way . Michael Vincent Halloran was broad and tall and very imposing indeed with a gun on his hip and a badge on his chest , but the priest still saw Mikey the altar boy , dark and intense in this land of bland and blond , tailing him through those years before puberty when the priesthood had still been a magnet . " Okay , then who were their friends ? " The priest sighed . " They had no friends . " " You 're not helping , Father . " " No , I suppose I 'm not . " Father Newberry frowned at the yellow crime-scene tape around the pews ahead , framing the centerpiece of John and Mary Kleinfeldt . Doc Hanson was rummaging in his bag now , bumping John Kleinfeldt 's body , grabbing it by the shoulder when it started to tip over . Father Newberry closed his eyes . Halloran tried again . " You said they tried to get several parishioners removed from the congregation because they believed they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But none of them took it seriously . I ca n't think of one who was really upset , the accusations were so preposterous . " " So none of them are really gay ? " Father Newberry hesitated again . " Not to my knowledge . " " I 'll need the list anyway , Father . You have a file on the Kleinfeldts ? Next of kin , that sort of thing ? " " In the church office , but they had no family . " " No kids ? " Father Newberry looked down at his hands , at the shiny spots on the knees of his pants that marked him as a professional supplicant , thinking that this was the gray area ; that dreaded place where the obligations to the secular and spiritual worlds clashed in a terrible way . He sorted through his memory for what he could say , setting aside what he could not . " I believe they had a child , but they refused to speak of him . Or her . I do n't even know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still alive ? " " I do n't know that either . I 'm sorry . " " It 's all right . Anything else you can tell me about them ? " The priest frowned , mentally ticking off the pathetically few scraps of information he possessed about the Kleinfeldts . " They were retired , of course , at their age . Both in their seventies , as I recall . Very devout , in their own way more than God 's , I 'm sorry to say . And very solitary . I do n't think they trusted a living soul , including me , and I always thought that was very sad . I suppose that is n't an uncommon trait among the wealthy . " Halloran looked doubtfully at the shabbily dressed corpses . " Land poor ? " Father Newberry shook his head . " They tithed a precise ten percent . December thirty-first every year they 'd send a check and a financial statement from their accountant to prove it was exactly ten percent , as if I would question it . " Halloran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . unusual people . " " So what were they worth ? " The priest looked up , found his memory on the ceiling . " Over seven million , I believe , but that was last year . It would be considerably more now . " Behind them the church door opened and closed and a wave of cold moved up the aisle , Bonar in its wake . He stopped next to Halloran . " We got nothing from the neighbors . State forensics is just pulling in . " His eyes narrowed on Halloran 's face . " What ? You got something ? " " Motive , maybe . Father tells me they were worth millions . " Bonar glanced up the aisle at the bodies . " No way . " " It is n't exactly a motive , Mike , " the priest interjected . " Unless you consider me a suspect . They left everything to the church . " Bonar elbowed Halloran . " I told you the padre did it . " Father Newberry almost smiled ; stopped it just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up in the front of the church Doc Hanson stood abruptly . " Oh shit . " He shot a quick , guilty glance back at Father Newberry . " Sorry , Father . Mike , you want to come and take a look at this ? " Beneath the black coat that Doc Hanson had started to unbutton , Mary Kleinfeldt 's once-white blouse was saturated with the red-brown of coagulating blood . The smell of it filled the pew . " She was shot in the chest , too ? " Halloran asked . Doc Hanson shook his head . " Not unless they brought along a cannon . Head hole looks like a .22 , and this is way too much blood for anything that small . " He unbuttoned the soggy blouse and opened it . The two deputies watching both took a quick step backward . " Jesus , " one of them whispered . " Looks like someone started a do-it-yourself autopsy . " Mary Kleinfeldt 's slip and bra had been sliced in half and peeled to each side , exposing blue-veined skin that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the center of her chest , exposing the sternum . Another gash ran horizontally , so deep that the lower half of her breasts hung inside out . Halloran stared at the old woman 's chest and felt a new kind of fear he could n't put a name to yet . " That 's not an autopsy incision , " he said softly . " It 's a cross . "
