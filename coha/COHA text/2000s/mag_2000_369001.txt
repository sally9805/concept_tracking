So you have built the better mousetrap  --  the world 's best mousetrap , you think . But the world has n't seemed to have got the message and is n't exactly beating a path to your door . What to do ? <P> The answer comes often late at night in the middle of a cable-TV show or sometimes on the back of a magazine . For a few hundred dollars , you are told , an invention-promotion company will evaluate your invention , research the patent to see whether anyone else had the idea first , and then contact manufacturers on your behalf . With one good idea , the ads say , you could be sitting on millions . <P> As many as 25,000 would-be inventors each year take the bait , and , quicker than you can say " rags to riches , " find themselves caught in a very different kind of mousetrap . Consumer advocates , government regulators and industry experts say that virtually everyone who contacts these firms with dreams of riches will in fact end up poorer . The vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nothing but massive scams aimed at often naive and sometimes desperate backyard tinkerers , many of whom have more hope than business acumen . Even the companies that operate within the law rarely provide inventors with the tools necessary to market their inventions . <P> Shannon Mahaffey 's experience is a case in point . He was living in Sweetwater , on the flat Texas plains that spawn tornadoes during the spring storm season . Often he would stay up nights watching the horizon as twisters cut deadly swaths nearby . Twice , he says , they touched down on his property , tearing up fences and farm equipment , though luckily missing his house . One night , while waiting up in a storm-induced blackout , he wondered whether there was a better way to warn people that a twister was forming : " I knew that the one thing that always worked in the disasters was the phone lines , because they are buried . So I invented a system that would provide storm warnings to rural areas where there are no sirens through the phone lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S THE DEAL ... <P> When the lights came back on , so did Mahaffey 's television . Lo and behold , right there on the screen was an ad with a toll-free number for Invention Submission Corp. , the nation 's largest patent broker and promotion company . He picked up the phone and dialed . <P> Today , after four years , Mahaffey , 34 , is more than $13,000 poorer , and his invention is still a dream . The father of two girls is disillusioned and bitter . <P> An enthusiastic ISC salesman told him the idea was brilliant  --  just what every inventor wants to hear  --  and pressured him to sign up before someone else came up with the same concept . Mahaffey quickly ponied up $625 , borrowed from family and friends , for the patent search . " They told me everything out there was based on radio transmissions , " he recalls . " I had an original idea , and I had to hurry to protect it . My father had invented the pop-top soda can but could n't afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want that to happen to me . " When ISC told him his idea would be expensive to bring to market , he winced . Like his father , he did n't have the money . It would n't be a problem , the salesman told him . A subsidiary of ISC would lend him the money until the royalties began to roll in . But those royalties never came .
