Blood and Pearls , or <br> How It Began <br> The last day of Shrovetide , a damp February in the year 1585 , great Elizabeth 's twenty-seventh year upon the throne . A small rain falling . A tender rain , veiling London 's scars . <br> The streets and lanes round St. Paul 's throbbed with stiltwalkers and fire-swallowers and pancake sellers and herb women and ratcatchers , all frantic to snatch the last bit of pleasure and meat pie they 'd get until Lent was over . A delirium of smells  --  roast goose , Shrove buns , early flowers brought in from the country , cinnamon and cloves in the spice merchants ' barrels . Chimney smoke . Sour piss in the gutters . Sounds , too  --  damp silk banners flapping from diamond-paned casements , chickens gaggling , dogs barking , a bookseller beating a thief . Street cries , high and low , overlapping each other in a sharp staccato . " Pails ! Any pails to mend ? " " Buy new broom , buy new broom , sweep and clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each , latest Irish atrocities ! " And music , of course . There was always music  --  fragile , rowdy , bawdy , tender . Lute players and flute players and little boys with tin whistles . Whores young and old . Beggars . Dwarves . Gypsies . Giants . Players in fusty wigs and cast-off velvets . Mummers in animal masks and bells on their shoes . In the middle of everything , a gang of apprentices pelting a huge wicker Jack o ' Lent with squidgy handfuls of mud . <br> I scanned the revellers and the market stalls , but aside from a long-faced Puritan or two , nobody looked like an assassin . Nobody ever does . A gingerbread seller dropped his tray with a curse and a clatter and I spun round , dagger drawn . <br> Gabriel 's hand touched my arm . " Robbie ? What ? " <br> " Nothing . " The Angel of Panic passing over my house . <br> " Bluddy holy war . ' Kill the heretic queen and earn a thousand extra years in bluddy heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " <br> In half a dozen cities of France , Catholic seminarians were trained in the latest Italian poisons and the best way to lay an undetectable trail of gunpowder into a queen 's bedchamber . Not counting the wax dolls with pins in them and the horoscopes with her birth hour smeared in blood , there had been , by my count , twenty-three serious attempts on Elizabeth 's life since her excommunication . Our master , Lord Secretary Burghley , had sent us out that day to prevent a twenty-fourth . <br> I filched a sugarplum from a sweet stall and popped it into my mouth . Felt the smothering tightness begin to ebb away from my throat . I wonder , does poison soothe before it kills ? Does it taste sweet on the tongue ? <br> " Our lady queen 's past fifty , " I told Gabriel . " An heir 's out of the question , so the marriage game wo n't keep France and Spain at bay any longer . They want Mary of Scots on the throne and England back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . It 's a fear game now . A death game . " <br> " So it 's still about money . " <br> " Idiot . Everything 's about money . Including sex and religion . " <br> We were fighting unofficial wars in half a dozen places and loyalties at court changed every time there was a royal patent or a monopoly to grab for . Of every three English , one was either an informer or a spy for whoever would pay most . For those in need of money , you spied to help them snatch it . For those with the chinks in their pockets , you spied on the snatchers . For Burghley and the queen , you spied on everyone at once . Spiders , some called us . Intelligencers . Robert Mowbray is not my real name , as Gabriel North was not his , but they served us well enough . <br> " Christ , I hate games , " he said softly , and his grey eyes flickered and went out . <br> We threaded our way deeper into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed walls and scrambled onto slippery rooftops hoping to see better . A ragged man held out his hand to me for alms and tried to speak , but when his mouth opened , I could see that his tongue had been cut out . For a split second , I stared helplessly into the furious cave of his soul . <br> " Think he 's dangerous ? " I said , as he went off clutching half a penny . <br> " They took his tongue , old heart , " Gabriel said quietly . " Not his balls . " <br> We walked on . Music and laughter came from the doorway of a barber 's shop . A maid emptied a chamber pot out a second-floor window and barely missed a pear-shaped old parson . <br> " Anything ? " <br> " Hide an arsenal under that parson 's gown , actually . " <br> " Never . Old John Tydway . Rector of St. Onesimus these thirty years . " <br> " The lute player , then ? Do n't like the look of him . Piggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ours . " <br> " Bollocks . " <br> A snot-nosed little boy stood tiptoe on the roof of a cookshop and shielded his eyes with his hand . Suddenly he began to flap his arms and crow like a rooster . " I can see her ! " he shouted . " The queen ! Long live the queen ! " <br> The whole crowd was set in motion , swirling and turning like a flock of hysterical starlings , settling , then swirling off in another direction . " Rose ! " cried a woman 's shrill , frightened voice . " Where are you , child ? Oh , Rosie ! " <br> A fair-haired little girl of four or five clutching a bedraggled bunch of primroses came tearing past us . Wide blue eyes that turned green in the light . A bounce of coarse homespun petticoats and a determined stamp of clumsy , eager little shoes . She owned the morning utterly , as only children can . <br> But she was poor and small and of little account to the grown-ups . Pushed aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stumbled against a bookstall and wobbled for an instant , trying to right herself . Then down she went in a puddle of muck , her flowers scattered everywhere . <br> In the blink of an eye , the primroses were brown mush , trodden by a dozen pairs of feet . The child turned her stubborn little face up and fixed Gabriel with a disapproving stare . What kind of grown-up was he , just standing there while the sky fell on her ? Her chin began to tremble . One sob , then another . Then all the tears of the drowned . She sat there on the filthy cobbles , head bent , small body rocking back and forth . <br> " Ah now , my pet , " Gabriel said , folding his long frame into a crouch above her , his cheek almost touching her fine hair . " Come on . Rosie ? That your name , then ? " He wiped her wet eyes with his sleeve . " Want a ride , my love ? Come on , come on , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coom ' ere . With me he spoke perfectly good London English , but with children , with most women , he often slipped into the country speech he 'd grown up with  --  Yorkshire , Lancashire . I 'd known him sixteen years and I had no idea where his home was , or even where he slept at night . He had no wife , but there were twin daughters somewhere called Judith and Sarah . He carried miniatures of them painted on the backs of playing cards . <br> " We ca n't stay standing here , " I told him sharply . " The child can find her own way home . " Friends we might be , but in the petty hierarchy of spies I was Gabriel 's proctor ; I gave him his orders and took his reports . <br> He shot me a withering look . " You 're a heartless bugger , Rob . No wonder you 're a dead loss with that French girl of yours . We ca n't just leave the poor mite to herself . " <br> I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was , of course . In such crowds , stray children were often stolen and sold into service , or worse . <br> So Gabriel swooped down and picked Rosie up , lifted her high in the air where her mother might catch sight of her , swung her round , then lifted her up again and again , till she was squealing with delight . In a moment , a frightened young woman in a rain-soaked white cap came pushing through the press of people towards us . " There you are , you naughty baggage , " she cried , taking her daughter in her arms . " Nay , it 's all right , my lamb . It 's all right . " <br> A pale creature , the mother was , little more than a girl herself , with a look of permanent weariness round her careful mouth , a nasty black eye , and a bruise on her neck . A wife , a dog , and a walnut tree , so the old saying went . The more you beat them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the queen , " she said uncertainly . There were bound to be gossips in the crowd , people who knew her . If she stayed talking too long , there 'd be more bruises before morning . <br> For a moment she studied her daughter 's rescuer , deciding how much deference he deserved  --  a tall , slender fellow of middle age , more unshaven than bearded , his sandy hair frizzled by the river damp and spangled with mist . A face that might have been made with a chisel  --  broad forehead , high cheekbones like the folded wings of a bird , nose a perfect narrow plane . Bootlaces undone , secondhand velvet breeches too big and balding at the seams , brown doublet flapping , shirt frills unfastened . Within the ratty costume of fabric and flesh , he waited out his private apocalypse . <br> The young mother settled for a nod of her head . " God bye you then . " <br> " Do n't go yet . " He tickled Rosie under the chin and tossed a coin to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen disappointed , hey , pet ? " <br> Let me tell you . There are fragments of living that slip beyond time and lodge themselves permanently in the present , that bring you suddenly out of hiding and drench you with a precious mortality . What comes next is such a moment . <br> Gabriel hands the little girl a nosegay of pansies . Heartsease , people call them . A simple act , deceptively casual . But then he does a thing I could never do . If I tried , it would become a clumsy ploy in a game of seduction , the sort of thing Annette 's disapproving French Protestant eyes would condemn in an instant and for which her sleek body would punish me all night long . <br> In him , it is without motive . It is real . He lets his hand stray towards Rosie 's girl-mother , his long fingers poised upon the air a quarter inch from her blackened , swollen eye , his broad palm so near he must feel the painful quaver of her lashes . He is learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whore , lady 's maid , duchess , little girl . When we use him in the dark work , it is for this secret communion with women , for the ways he can maneuver them to further our needs . Whilst I maneuver him . <br> But whatever I let my masters believe , this is beyond me , beyond my spider 's control . It is how his blood thinks . <br> Watching him , a part of me is crippled with envy and love . <br> And then the moment shatters and another begins , and another and another . The wild bells start to ring . Trumpets sound and the Queen 's Guard appears with Captain Ralegh , dark and tall and splendid in his silver-chased armor and crimson sash , riding ahead of them . Four Yeomen run beside Elizabeth 's great white horse and four ladies ride horseback behind her , all dressed in velvet gowns of sea-green and peach-color and lion-tawny . <br> The queen herself wears dove-grey velvet , the sleeves pinked with claret-colored satin and the skirt and bodice and stomacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pale pink ruff are studded with smaller pearls , and the silver caul that catches her flame-colored wig under her riding hat is pricked with pearls . They are a magical armor . Behind it , she will never grow old . <br> She pulls up the horse , untangles her skirts from the sidesaddle , and slides down to the ground . Ralegh dismounts and sweeps her a gorgeous bow , and the queen laughs her famous wild laugh , courting the crowd . " Oh , he 's a pretty fellow , do n't you think ? Pray God this rain does not rust him ! " <br> " Long live Her Majesty ! " cries a pieman , and a great cheer rises and rises , flowing like a joyous and dangerous tide . Elizabeth waves , laughs , waves again , making a face at the stiltwalker . Another cheer . <br> The hysteria is reaching its height . Her body sways in an invisible current , and Gabriel 's eyes do not leave her face . Her elegant head turns slightly , the fine bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light thickens . Time stops and the universe stumbles . Beneath the gaudy surface of the crowd , some new darkness gathers . People moving aside , people grumbling . Figures inching towards her . Shadows . Ghosts of shadows . <br> The hot-apple-pieman approaches , holding out some of his wares . " Come , sir , " Elizabeth beckons him . " Queening  --  it is hungry work , you know . " <br> He moves forward . My throat tightens and my eyes scan the square . No sign of the tongueless man . A cutpurse is hard at work now , and a young girl is foisting pockets . A one-eyed mountebank has been selling potions , a hundred tiny bottles swinging from cords on his jerkin , his shirt sleeves , his breeches . Inside his ragged cloak something else clatters . A dull , thick , implacable sound . <br> Elizabeth 's eyes are like whips , flicking the crowd . She sees the potion-seller . Disregards him . When she sees Gabriel she looks away and then looks back again , intensely aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , older than the flexed curve of his body . Older than his unaccountable smile . <br> The dull sound comes again . The queen glances at the mountebank and her gloved hand lifts , one long , thin finger pointing him out . That one , there . The shape of death . The sound of it . Rattle of steel . Boots on the cobbles . There . <br> And then out of nowhere , children 's high voices are singing . Long may she reign , in majesty glorious , ever victorious , God save the queen . They walk in procession , herded by the tubby , beaming old parson . Little boys with jenny wrens in gilt cages , and Shrove buns , and poems on scrolls tied with ribbons . Little girls . Little girls with bunches of flowers . And Rosie , her blue-green eyes shining . Rosie , with her bunch of heartsease . <br> Gabriel 's head jerks round and his body pivots to face the potion-seller . Something gleams in the pewter light and then everything happens at once , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Woven under the noise of the crowd , the fragile chiming of glass bottles as the mountebank throws back his cloak and raises a pistol , a petronel , to take aim at the painted oval of Elizabeth 's face . <br> " Miserere mei , Deus ! " he cries , crossing himself . God have mercy on me . <br> Gabriel lunges , long body sprawling , knocking down people like ninepins . Knocking down children . Rosie is somewhere in the midst of them , I can hear her wailing . The sound of a hundred tiny bottles all smashing together as the two men struggle . Then a flat thump , not much louder than the fistfuls of mud that hit the Jack o ' Lent . The gun has been fired , the muffled sound of damp powder . But at so near a distance even a bungled shot can kill . <br> Someone 's blood spatters Elizabeth and she crumples , only her stiffened farthingale and her five layers of skirts keep her out of the gutter . " Get her up , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she is a bit of fallen plaster or a broken cup . <br> " God 's death ! " she screams at him . " God 's deeeeeeaaaaaaath ! The children ! " <br> For an instant , Gabriel 's fist poises itself like a hammer in the air , and then I lose sight of him completely . The mummer with the lion mask dives for the assassin 's weapon , kicks it under the bookstall . The old parson snatches a little girl out of the way , then another and another . One boy 's arm is broken , he is howling . Another has a bloody nose . Rosie 's grey gown is smeared with blood , but she is not hurt , she still clutches her pansies . Her mother screams and screams and screams . <br> And what do I do ? Why , nothing . I see the apple tart smashed on the ground at Elizabeth 's feet . The grit of broken glass . The pieman staring down at his bloody arms where the pistol ball has passed through both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse . The queen 's pearls splashed with blood . <br> But I keep my distance . I am a watcher , it has always been my part in the dark work of spying . I observe . I remember . I hear confessions , but I do not extract them . I attend upon history 's cock-ups . I wait and do nothing , even when waiting is the worst crime of all . <br> Continues ...
