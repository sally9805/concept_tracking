From sponge baths to the big tub , how to make getting clean more fun for both of you // It 's hard to beat the sweet smell and silky feel of a freshly bathed baby . And getting her that way can be half the fun . " When I give Kya a bath , I think of it as a playful bonding time rather than a chore to hurry through , " says Jessica Reedy of Decatur , Illinois , of her 1-year-old . " And we both end up singing and laughing . " Many parents use a bath as part of their baby 's pre-bedtime ritual . Washing up at the same time each day can be a relaxing routine , but you need n't feel that you have to give your infant a bath daily . Two or three soaks a week-with spot sponging of her face , hands , and diaper area in between-will do , especially in the cooler months .

Lay down a pad or fluffy towel for him to rest on , and fill the sink or a bowl with warm ( not hot ) water . Test it with your elbow or wrist , since your hands are n't as sensitive to heat . You 'll want to collect all of your supplies ( see " Gear Guide , " page 177 ) before you start bathing . ( A word about timing : Right before or after meals is n't ideal , since your baby may be hungry and irritable or more likely to spit up from being jostled around . ) Cleanup To keep your baby feeling warm and secure , drape a towel over his lower half while you wash his upper body , and vice versa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby facing you , rest his back on your forearm , with his head in the palm of your hand .

Once he 's clean and dry , dab his umbilical cord ( get underneath the scab ) with a cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol , and allow it to air-dry ( fold the top of the diaper down so the cord is exposed to the air ) . infant tub : the next step After your baby 's cord has fallen off and her navel has healed , she 's ready for an infant tub or the sink : Setup Putting an infant tub inside the big tub minimizes mess , but you may find this position tough on your back , and your baby may find the expanse of the big tub a little scary . A better bet may be the floor . Place a plastic tablecloth or shower curtain underneath for easy cleanup . If she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure there 's nothing unsafe within reach . Move the faucet out of the way so she does n't bump her head on it , or cover it with a foam protector . Cleanup A molded sponge insert will let your baby lie in an infant tub without slipping , freeing both your hands for washing . ( Or you can line the tub with a towel . ) But be ready to grab her if she moves suddenly , and never leave your baby alone in or near the water , no matter how shallow . If your sink has a handheld hose , she 'll love the feel of the warm , gently running water , and you can easily rinse her off . family tub : making a splash When your baby can sit up-usually by 6 to 8 months-he can graduate to bigger waters . Setup Place a rubber mat or nonslip appliques on the bottom of the tub to prevent slipping .

Cleanup At this stage , lathering can be a little more challenging-but more enjoyable too . " My nine-month-old , Zachary , loves to splash around , " says Brandi Whitson of Allen , Texas . " He scoops up water in his plastic pail and pours it out like a waterfall , giggling the whole time . " " Keep his hands busy if you want to get the job done , " says Dawn Maniglia of Brooklyn . Her son Matthew , 18 months , " helps " by scrubbing his arms and lees with a soft toothbrush while she 's washing him .

When Shayne Kraynyk , 1 , of Sewickley , Pennsylvania , outgrew her baby bath , her mom , Sharon Yeager , took the spongy insert that lined it and put it in the big tub . " It helped make all that cold porcelain a little friendlier . " For the first few months , the only way I could coax my daughter , Lilianna , to get into our tub was to climb in with her , holding her close the whole time . ( At least I did n't have to worry about keeping dry . ) But even then , she was n't keen on hair rinsing . To get your child to put her head back , try going beyond a well-timed " Look up here ! " : Place some stickers or a mobile on the ceiling above the tub , or have her imitate a coyote by howling at an imaginary moon . If she has long locks , you can ask her to lie back in the water until her hair 's submerged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with clean water may do the trick . Of course , some kids wo n't be appeased at bathtime under any circumstances , and there are times when even the most easygoing ones would rather be anywhere but in the tub . But of all of the parenting duties that fall under the grin-and-bear-it category , at least this one promises irresistible rewards-the palatable scent and kissable softness of your freshly bathed baby .
