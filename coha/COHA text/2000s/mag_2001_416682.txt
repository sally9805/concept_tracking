Discover our top spots to explore in San Antonio , Chattanooga , and Charlottesville . Then plan your trip . // We sent a trio of travel writers to three of the South 's most popular cities in search of the most refreshing reasons to visit each of them  --  even during one of the hottest months of the year . Here 's what they found . Soothing San Antonio When I think of San Antonio , I envision a city that 's loads of fun and affordable to boot . To me , that 's one cool combination , and here 's how I took advantage of it on my recent visit . The River Walk is the top spot when it comes to cool . I took a boat cruise to enjoy the breeze and get a look at all the shops and restaurants . One eatery , the hot new Manduca , is where I spent the rest of my evening . Skip the entrees and dessert , and just feast on appetizers and mango margaritas . After a good night 's sleep , drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic missions , including The Alamo , Mission Concepcion , Mission San Jose , Mission San Juan , and Mission Espada . Some advice : Go early to avoid the heat because the air is all natural inside . In need of some cold iced tea , I headed next to The Guenther House , which stands on the fringe of the historic King William District . After lunch , follow the walking tour past elegant homes built by German families who settled in San Antonio in the mid-1800s . Nearby , Blue Star Arts Complex showcases some of the city 's best contemporary art . After I browsed awhile , hunger pangs led me to Rosario 's , where the fresh salsa satisfied my craving for Tex-Mex . Meanwhile , the weekend band entertained me with salsa of a different sort . I did n't dance but had a blast watching the other brave souls . For shopping with a local flair , I chose El Mercado at the city 's lively Market Square for everything from Mexican jewelry to pinatas . I also made sure to stop at Mi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexican pastries this side of the border . No cool trip is complete without a dip in the water , so Saturday afternoon I went swimming with beluga whales at SeaWorld . Visitors can swim with the whales or with sea lions through the park 's fascinating Interaction Program . It 's way cooler than any hotel pool . When I dried off , I went to Niles Wine Bar , a funky and eclectic place on Broadway that 's the buzz around town . Later , it was musical time at the amazing Majestic Theatre . Opened in 1929 , the Majestic brought air conditioning to San Antonio , but it 's a cool place for more reasons than that . On the way back to the hotel , I drove to Central Market H-E-B , a grocery store of Lone Star proportions . After my evening of arts , I bought bunches of fresh flowers to cheer up my hotel room and some sushi to enjoy for a late-night snack . I do n't know about you , but I call that the ultimate cool vacation in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio 's cool stops include the hip River Walk , historical missions , and stylish Mi Tierra restautant .

BELOW : Spot an otter in the Tennessee Aquarium 's Cove Forest . // During one of the hottest months of the year , I found out that Chattanooga is cool ( cooler than an Eskimo Pie , cooler than a George Foreman grill , cooler than Nancy Kerrigan on ice ) . It 's a city full of family-friendly places , and more than enough chilly spots to help beat the heat . Water is synonymous with the word " cool , " and at the Tennessee Aquarium there 's 450,000 gallons of it . Out of the aquarium 's 24 exhibits , the Cove Forest , dressed to resemble a misty Appalachian Mountain forest complete with blooming flowers and swimming otters , ranks as one of the coolest . Next door awaits the IMAx Theater where I put on those zany 3-D glasses and waited to view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt . I 'm glad I purchased the combo ticket that provides admission to both the aquarium and the IMAX . It kept me from being late for the show , which is a good thing . The theater prohibits latecomers from entering , so get there on time . Because all those pyramids put me in a mood for discovery , I then went digging for dinosaur bones at the Creative Discovery Museum . Here , kids of all ages can be archaeologists , build robots , or paint like Rembrandt . Next , I hurried off to 212 Market Restaurant for lunch . Owned and operated by a mother-daughter trio ( mother Maggie and daughters Susan and Sally ) , the restaurant pioneered high-end cuisine in the area even before the revitalization of downtown . No visit would be complete without a tour of the Chattanooga AfricanAmerican Museum/Bessie Smith Performance Hall . The museum highlights achievements of noted African Americans within the community , while the hall pays homage to its namesake world-acclaimed blues singer . About the only public place where an entire family may strip down without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile public area along the Tennessee River ) . I made a dash through the park 's interactive fountain , which is guarded by water-spouting lions , tigers , and bears ( watch out , Toto ) . Sopping wet but satisfied , I returned to the Chattanooga Choo Choo Holiday Inn to change clothes . During its life as a train depot in the early 1900s , the Choo Choo welcomed thousands of travelers en route to various destinations . Today as a 30-acre hotel , it welcomes just as many families to a fun time . Take in a garden tour here , and do n't miss the dining experience  --  servers sing that old-time favorite for which the hotel is named . To hide out from the heat , visit the caverns of Ruby Falls . If you 're cold natured like I am , bring a jacket as the caverns remain a spine-tingling 60 degrees year-round . Remember that children 's book , Where the Wild Things Are ? My mama often told me that I was one of them , but you and your wee one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Warner Park Zoo . After an entertaining encounter with my buddies at the zoo , I retreated to the neighborhood ice-cream parlor , Homemade Ice Cream on the Corner . After sampling a tasty strawberry scoop , I muttered , " What does mama know anyway ? " And that was probably the coolest part of all . Farrah Austin No . Chill in Charlottesville Even if you 're new in town , its easy to fall in step with the laid-back pace of Charlottesville , Virginia . Thomas Jefferson 's Monticello crowns this city that seems to be tops on almost everyone 's list these days . Tennis Magazine calls it the Best Tennis Town in America , and in 1998 Money Magazine ranked it the top Small City in the South .

BELOW : Cafes and shops line the outdoor mall in the heart of the city . // Despite its rising population , which includes an impressive migration of bestselling novelists , Charlottesville has kept its small-town feel . John Grisham is often seen chalking the baselines at Cove Creek Park , the youth baseball park he funded in nearby Covesville . On a hot summer morning , I ducked into the frosty air rising from the indoor rink at the Charlottesville Ice Park , the coolest place in town . At noon , I strolled beneath the shade trees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America . I sat outside at The Hardware Store Restaurant , where tempting desserts fill a whole page of the menu . I ordered a refreshing watermelon smoothie and watched the town 's eclectic citizens pass by on their way to bookstores , cafes , and shops . Later , I drove up to Monticello to tour the flower and vegetable gardens . Jefferson called the fruit from his orchards " precious refreshment . " Visitors can sample apples , peaches , and grapes at a fruit-tasting workshop on August 18 . On a mountainside near Monticello , a languid summer day fades into a starry , music-filled evening at the Ash Lawn  --  Highland Summer Festival , home of Jefferson 's neighbor , James Monroe . Order a chic picnic basket from nearby Brix Marketplace for dinner on the lawn . Be sure to have chef/owner Karen Laetare slip in some icy bottles of Root 66 Root Beer . The frosty beverage is bottled in Charlottesville and sold in stores and restaurants all over the city . Even on the hottest days , the shaded grounds and walled gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I like to call this an aerial nature walk , " Rick Behr says as he sends his hot-air balloon rising above the treetops at the nearby Boar 's Head Inn . Bright as an Easter egg , the balloon rides the wind past the university 's rotunda and other familiar landmarks . Rick , owner of Boar 's Head Ballooning , sometimes dips low enough to let passengers pick leaves from tall trees . " You can see the topography of the city , " he says . Magnificent mountains and rivers lace the countryside around Charlottesville . It 's refreshing to cool off with a lazy ride on the James River at Scottsville , a Tom Sawyer-style town where river riders slip into the water in rafts , canoes , and inner tubes beside the Hatton Ferry , one of the last two hand-poled ferries in the nation . Early one morning I climbed the trail up Humpback Rocks on the Blue Ridge Parkway . It was a hot , almost straight-up climb that took nearly an hour , but at the top I was rewarded with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was cool and wonderful .
