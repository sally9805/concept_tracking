<p> The process has been stealthy in some cities , hardly noted by residents . Elsewhere , it has turned ugly . <p> Some people circulated fliers and stormed offices when they learned who their neighbors were . Others spoke of burning down homes and castrating their residents . <p> Sex offenders are engendering fear in metro Denver just by living , not offending . When Lakewood officials saw four pedophiles and one first-degree sex offender registered at the same address last summer , they decided to alter city ordinances to prevent such groupings . <p> Their move - not a result of any incident - set off a domino effect that is still clinking throughout the suburbs . <p> Aurora , Englewood , Thornton and Superior passed similiar ordinances within months . Northglenn and Golden approved measures in December . Federal Heights OK 'd one last week . Westminster is researching the issue . Even Greenwood Village , with only one registered sex offender in town , is revising its codes . And this week Jefferson County could become the first Colorado county to preclude sex offenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' I think what 's moving this is a fear of the unknown , and councils responding to constituents , ' said Northglenn City Manager Jim Landeck . ' But surely the intent is a safer city . ' <p> Some who treat the rapists , exhibitionists and child molesters say you 're probably better off living next door to five sex offenders than you are living blocks away from one . They say more than a decade of experience is proof . But there are no acknowledged studies that say group living works , and there are no studies that say it does n't . <p> Are you safe ? That may be a more difficult question than any ordinance can answer . And where will sex offenders end up ? That question is perhaps more difficult still . <p> The home that started the wave of local debate early last year was a rental house in Lakewood where 17-year sex-offender treatment specialist Greig Veeder was using the ' shared living arrangement ' approach he pioneered to manage adult men . The homes now sparking debate in Jefferson County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boys are quite different , experts say , but seem to incite similar fears in neighbors who can now use Megan 's Law , federal legislation that requires states to release information to the public concerning registered sex offenders , to find out where each offender lives . <p> Many agree that adult sex offenders do not belong in residential settings . It 's not the temptation that decreases when a sex offender is moved to a commercial or industrial area - it 's the number of targets . According to the state 's Sex Offender Management Board , sex offending is a behavioral disorder without a cure . <p> ' That said , what cities are doing is self-serving . Communities are going to be more endangered by it , ' Veeder said . ' These are crimes of secrecy . You 'd be a lot safer if they grouped up and put them next door to you . More uncomfortable , but more safe . They 'll go somewhere else to score a victim . And they 'll go by themselves . ' <p> Juvenile home founders like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a neighborhood - it 's overwhelmingly boys that are at issue - helps their self-esteem , their ability to learn to function safely in a community and their ability to reconnect with their own families . They say that since boys are still growing , physically and emotionally , the chance exists to change their behavior and their outlook as long as they are n't further damaged by being ostracized in an institutional setting . <p> Hearing that is one thing , living with it another . <p> ' The program itself is probably very good ; we just have a problem with where it is , ' said Columbine Knolls resident Karen Hansen . ' Are we overreacting , or are we lucky nothing 's happened ? ' <p> Fear and compassion <p> Shiloh means ' house of tranquility ' in Hebrew . Some neighbors scoff at the suggestion of peace amid the three Columbine-area homes that house eight sex-offending boys each in the same neighborhoods . Others , including a next-door neighbor to one of the homes , say that after existing for years with no problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson County Planning Commission meeting brought together a tense mix of fear and compassion . Though the issue was group living for all sex offenders , most of the 28 who spoke focused on those from Shiloh homes . <p> ' We are disappointed in our neighbors who allowed themselves to be manipulated by innuendo , fear and lies , and they were herded into the closest thing I 've ever seen to a lynch mob , ' said John Fasciani , who represented a Christ 's Church of the Valley fellowship group that volunteers monthly with Shiloh boys . <p> ' Investing in other 's lives with our own lives is the way we teach our kids . Healthy , vibrant communities do not bury their heads in the sand , naively believing that a problem sent elsewhere actually goes away . ' <p> About one-third of Shiloh 's boys come from the neighborhoods that want them out . Some neighbors , including the local League of Women Voters chapter , say that 's among the reasons they should be allowed to stay . Others do n't care about who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have the potential to do again . <p> ' The risk is simply too great for a residential area , ' said John Gross , an attorney representing the neighbors who served on the county task force that studied the issue . <p> ' I really do n't want to see my grandchildren become a victim at their hands , ' said 29-year resident Jim West . <p> In 15 years , no Shiloh resident has re-offended in the community while a part of the Shiloh program . Accusations such as asking a neighborhood girl for a phone number and shining a laser beam in a bedroom window have been made against the boys . For 90 percent of the boys , according to Shiloh , their victim was not a stranger . <p> In two years , 94 calls have been received by the Jefferson County sheriff 's office relating to homes with multiple sex offenders . Missing-person calls particularly concern County Administrator Ron Holliday . Planning Commissioner Jan Rousselot , who cast the sole vote against the zoning changes , said she saw no more problems than would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-and-forth likely will continue Tuesday when Jefferson County commissioners consider the one-offender-per-home change . <p> The county , unlike cities , deals with zoning but also has a responsibility for the placement of children . Officials have taken longer than other municipalities to study the matter , incorporated more people into the process and branched out from a single zoning change to a host of recommendations that could have impact statewide . The county also is looking for suitable areas to house juvenile offenders . A rural site north of Golden has been pinpointed for a home . <p> One question that officials have asked in other cities is : ' Could I live there ? ' <p> ' As a mother , I would not want to live next door to a group home for sex offenders , ' said Kathy Green , who voted with her Aurora City Council colleagues to pass an emergency ordinance so as not to attract the group homes driven out of Lakewood . ' There is no proof they were less likely to re-offend living together If I knew there were just one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle they drive , their comings and goings . ' <p> The focus in Jefferson County has been on sex offenders living together - eight Jefferson County homes housing eight to 10 sex offenders each . <p> But there are more than 170 registered sex offenders scattered throughout the unincorporated area and about 700 countywide . <p> ' Notion of comfort ' <p> You might not like what Veeder has to say . But you 're welcome to tell him so every Tuesday night at south Denver 's Cucina Leone restaurant . He has a standing table , and a standing offer to the public to discuss controlling sex offenders . <p> ' I 'm not saying sex offenders are safe . But cities are selling the notion of comfort , ' he said , ' maybe not willing to deal with whether in fact they are . ' <p> Veeder 's Denver-based Teaching Humane Existence is a nonprofit that pioneered Colorado 's use of polygraphs to treat sex offenders , was one of the first to introduce shared living arrangements for controlling sex offenders and wrote legislation including the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his 17 years of experience , he wo n't try to tell you the men he works with are curable . But they also are not trash waiting for officials to find a palatable landfill site . <p> ' It 's sweeping something under a rug . We 're going from big lumps to lots of little lumps , ' Veeder said . ' They are n't going away , and they are n't changing . So we 've got to find the ' where ' where we 'll put them . Right now they are treated like trout - catch and release . ' <p> The men living together in Lakewood who inadvertently prompted the ordinance there tried to stay together and then scattered . One was caught inappropriately using the Internet and was turned in by a housemate . That 's an example , Veeder said , of the potential positive effects of housing sex offenders together . <p> To Veeder , the safest and most appropriate solution for managing sex offenders is a large staffed dormitory or campus on the edge of communities . But he doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gas station or homeowner . <p> State Sen. Norma Anderson attended sex offender therapy sessions to gain exposure for her work on legislation . Changes in the works include recognizing the need for a state-level juvenile sex offender board , since only adults have one now , and giving a guardian or group home operators the ability to take sex offenders off the registry when they move . Listings are not always current , Anderson said . <p> ' I truly understand why cities are doing what they 're doing with these ordinances . If I was sitting on a city council I 'd do same thing , ' Anderson said . ' But with the knowledge I have from this level , I might do it a little differently . ' <p> One city official likened the string of ordinances to an episode of musical chairs . No one is sure what areas will be left for sex offenders to land . Douglas County has been contacted by a Jefferson County group home for sex offenders looking at property miles south of Castle Rock . <p> There are other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to think about an uncomfortable subject , to admit it 's in their communities . Some are taking the initiative to protect their families by checking the sex offender registries , some taking it a step further by getting involved on a city or county level for the first time . <p> For more information on Jefferson County 's proposed phasing out of group homes from residential areas , visit www.co.jefferson.co.us and click on special projects .

Visit the law enforcement agency that serves your area , see the records department and explain what area you are interested in learning about . Most jurisdictions will ask the reason - i.e. , Are you a resident ? Do your children attend a nearby school ?
