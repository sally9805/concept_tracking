" What you wearing them sunglasses for ? " I 'd felt Roxi 's shifty glances for the past thirty minutes . I knew the square black frames with gold specks made me look like a June bug , but I still hoped Roxi would drop the subject . As I figured things that morning , I had two choices : either wear the insect spectacles or miss a day of work . And I never missed work . The thunderous drill of sewing machines provided an easy out . I proceeded to sew another zipper and added the completed product to the bushel of blue rayon slacks piled in a plastic carton at my tennis shoes . I 'm gon na get wrote up if I do n't hustle , I thought and tried to dismiss Roxi 's coal-eyed glances . " Erma Lee , you fixin ' to be a movie star or something ? " Roxi asked with her rugged laugh . I did n't know anybody else who could laugh and talk at the same time . Glancing at the big white clock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her any longer . It was another twenty minutes until Roxi 's smoke break . The comments mixed with her cigarette induced laugh would only get stronger . " Yeah . I 'm on the first bus to Hollywood this evening . " I avoided her stare and concentrated on my machine . The hammering needle put a perfect stitch in the crotch of a pair of navy pants . Her gravel laugh let loose again . " I know that 's right . Take me too . " Roxi tossed a pair of khakis into the carton . The zigzag of sixty industrial needles was the only sound I heard . Good , she 'll be on to something else directly . " You got home trouble ? " I shot a quick look across at Roxi 's station . She was n't laughing anymore . Her silver-framed glasses perched on the edge of her nose . The way her black eyes rolled upward made me feel like a schoolteacher was getting onto me . " No . " To make it look like I was really telling the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her getting all in my business . " Girl , you forget I been here as long as you . I hope them sunglasses ai n't a return to when you ... " " I 'm gon na miss my quota if we keep flapping our jaws like this . " I was scared to death to look at Roxi . Terrified she 'd know the truth . Who are you fooling ? She already knows , I told myself . And so does everybody else in this metal building . Why did n't I just call in sick ? Roxi sighed and for a couple of minutes focused again on the khaki slacks . " I ai n't seen no woman who 's tough as you put up with crap like that . You know what I 'm saying ? " I shifted my eyes behind the dark bug frames . Roxi was hunched over the white sewing machine , smacking a piece of gum . " My cousin Darlene  --  you know the one I 'm talking about . She put up with that same mess . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband of hers . " The rugged chuckle erupted again . " Yes , ma'am . He punched her one too many times is all . You know what I 'm saying ? " Roxi suddenly stopped sewing and put both hands on her seated hips . " And she not half the woman you are . " Roxi 's unexpected glare made me flinch . Just when I turned to look back at the strip of metal zipper , it happened . Like a mosquito gone mad , the steel needle pounded my right index finger . Numbing pain shot up my fingernail to the top of my shoulder . Snatching my foot off the control pedal , I flew backwards and screamed , " God bless America ! " Roxi jumped to the rescue and pried the needle from loose , bloody skin , tearing more in the process . I moaned , trying not to call more attention than was already coming my way . When I looked up and saw the crowd of women gathering , my right hand began to throb . It was almost worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Bozo slammed his fist into my eye . The passenger 's seat in Mama 's silver Escort pressed hard against my back . I stroked my hair , which draped over my shoulder in a ponytail . Mama said long hair was a luxury we did n't have time for . Mama always used the pronoun we when setting ground rules for herself . I adjusted the sunglasses , hoping she would notice the big square frames and ask why I was wearing them . I mapped out my response . I 'd say , " I got a bandage to cover twenty stitches , just like I got a disguise to cover my banged-up eye . " But Mama never was one for questions about cosmetic matters . " That hospital ai n't nothing but a first-aid clinic , " Mama yelled . " We coulda got the same treatment at the factory clinic and saved me hauling you into town . As it is , I 'll get docked for the past three hours . " " Well , I 'm so sorry , Mama . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better for you . " I edged closer to the passenger window . A haze blanketed the cold glass . After a few miles , the hum from the engine filled the car . She could care less if Bozo had hit me or not . Mama made her opinion known the day after Bozo and me adopted our granddaughter , Cher . " You cause him to leave you , and you 're up the creek . And now you with that grandbaby to raise . " I still remember Mama shaking her silver head like she had hornets flying around the boyish mane . " And do n't think I can take care of you and that young ' un . No siree , not me . " Not that Mama would realize it , but whenever there 's been any caring to do , it 's been me . Ever since Daddy walked out , I was expected to step up to the plate . Mama took a job at the new Haggar factory , and at fourteen I took a job raising my six brothers and sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
