Walker can hurt opponents from behind the 3-point line or near the basket . // By finally embracing the brash ways of ANtoine Walker , the Celtics seek a return to the glory days There was a time when Antoine Walker was known as the least-liked player in the NBA . It 's an unfair moniker-how do you measure something like that , anyway ?  --  but , make no mistake , no player was more successful in alienating whole groups around the league than Walker . His teammates disliked his selfish play . His coaches criticized his attitude , shot selection and conditioning . Other coaches cringed at the thought of dealing with players like him . Opponents riled at his trash talking and immaturity . Referees spited him for his nonstop lip-flapping and lack of decorum . In the Boston media , he was called a " punk , " a " jerk " and " brain dead . " Remember , if you will , all those gems from The Antoine Chronicles . Remember the time that Walker , during a game in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Throw me the ( expletive ) ball , " Remember how former Celtics coach Rick Pitino tried and failed to get Walker to lose 20 pounds , how he said of Walker 's shot selection , " If you 're going to keep on taking them , go out and practice for three hours until you make those shots . Or do n't take them . " Remember when Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich derisively referred to Walker as , " the typical new-age player , " and when Tim Hardaway said of Walker , " he 's just an ass . I know it , and he knows it . " Remember that Walker told The Boston Globe , after two seasons in the league , that he was a " veteran All-Star , " and should not have to report to summer minicamps . Remember also his 30 technical fouls in his first two seasons . Photograph Walker can hurt opponents from behind the 3-point line or near the basket . Photograph Pierce ( left ) knows how to play with Walker , and O'Brien knows how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the FleetCenter in Boston , mind you-hated Walker . Hated him . Booed him relentlessly , like the time in April 1999 when Walker began to hear the jeers on his first shot . Then he heard more booing , louder and louder throughout the game . He finished that outing-a loss-3-for-12 from the field , with the abuse so bad that he nearly cried in the locker room . This was the captain of the Celtics , a distinction held by the likes of Bob Cousy , Bill Russell and Larry Bird . Yet there he was , nearly brought to tears by the derision of the home crowd . That was Antoine Walker . This should be the part where we tell you how much Walker has redeemed the sins of his past . This is where we ought to give you an overview of how he has given up his brashness and selfishness , won over the hearts of the fans and now is gallantly leading the Celtics to a stunning renewal of their past glory . Forget it . One out of three will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up opponents with his belly-shaking , fist  --  flailing " Walker Wiggle , " though the wiggles come less frequently now . He chatters at opponents nonstop . Walker still is selfish , too . As Hornets forward P.J. Brown says , " He thinks he is Chuck Connors out there , always shooting , no matter what . He 's the Rifleman . " Walker is shooting just 39 percent from the field , and he leads the league in field-goal attempts and is on pace to break the NBA 's single-season record for 3-point attempts . It 's difficult to embrace a player like that , and Walker still hears boos in Boston when he is having a bad game . FleetCenter fans have taken a stronger shine to Paul Pierce , Walker 's more athletic , more reserved and more palatable co-captain . But it is Walker who is leading the team to some semblance of its past greatness , or at least , to the playoffs . Despite Pierce 's performance-he is second in the league in scoring and undoubtedly an All-Star-it is Walker who drives this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , second best in the East . Walker has been driving this team since he arrived in Boston in 1996 , and as much as he can be blamed for the team 's erratic showings over the first part of his career , he should receive credit for the Celtics ' success this year . Walker has not done this through some radical inner transformation that made him more lovable and changed his attitude toward his team and his responsibilities . Walker still is not particularly lovable . But his team has changed its attitude toward him and what it asked of him , and his team is reaping the benefits . It was a messy night for the Celtics in Philadelphia on December 17 . They trailed by 22 just after the half . But a brief run in the third quarter trimmed the deficit to 13 , and that 's when it started . First Walker , then Pierce . Talking , talking , talking , despite what eventually was a 16-point Celtics loss . Walker shot a miserable 6-for-23 from the field , including 0-for-11 from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , there was a hint as to why opponents do n't like Walker much . " As soon as they came back a little , all you heard was Antoine talking , " said Allen Iverson . Two days later , when asked about the 0-for-11 nightmare , Walker gave a bigger hint as to why Celtics fans do n't like him much . " If I go 0-for-50 ; " Walker said , " I 'll still put it up . " What gets lost in the surface arrogance of such declarations is that Walker is supposed to keep putting it up . He very well could go 0-for-50 from the 3-point line , and he would be encouraged to keep shooting . When Pitino was coaching , that was different . Pitino often called Walker , " the most important person in the organization , " but he wanted Walker to be more selective with his shots and less selfish . That Pitino could not get Walker to fit that image of how Walker should play was part of Pitino 's undoing in Boston . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a year ago was to indulge in Walker 's selfishness and make it part of the game plan . Walker and Pierce always have the green light to shoot , and with a roster lacking in scorers , that makes sense . Photograph Walker still complains to referees and talks a lot of trash , but it does n't look so bad when the Celtics are winning . // " Antoine is a very intelligent basketball player , " O'Brien says . " If he is shooting and missing , and people want to complain , that is fine . He has the approval of his coach . He knows what he is doing , and he knows that what he is doing is helping us win . He has a great understanding of the game , and I trust him with that . " At the heart of Walker 's basketball intelligence is a simple notion : putting defenders into uncomfortable positions . Walker may not be a great 3  --  point shooter , but he is a threat from the arc and obviously is not afraid to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good package of inside moves and some of the best rebounding instincts in Celtics history . And he 's among the game 's best post passers . He is averaging 23.8 points , 9.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists . That 's what most chafes Celtics fans : Walker could be getting more high-percentage shots and setting up teammates better , if he would only stay in the post . But Walker shifts his style based on his defender . Take a recent game against the Jazz , for example . When Walker was guarded by Karl Malone , he drifted out to the 3-point line , taking Malone with him . That disrupted the way the Jazz prefers to play defense and disrupted Malone 's rebounding and his ability to help his teammates . When the Jazz stuck lanky rookies Jarron Collins and Andrei Kirilenko on Walker , Walker slid into the post . When asked where he would prefer to have Walker , Utah coach Jerry Sloan said , " Well , I would prefer him on our team " After his poor outing in Philadelphia , the Cavaliers started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed in the post almost exclusively , shooting 12-for-18 and taking only three 3-pointers . " I do n't worry that much about 3s , " Walker says . " I worry about the matchup . I am going to do what I have to do to help the team win . It 's part of our strategy , having their big guys step out so I can get open looks . But if you start a point guard on me , I am not going to take 3s . I am going into the post . I am not that dumb . " The result , often , is a frustrating night for the defender charged with checking Walker , whether he is a guard , forward or center . " He really takes away from my game , as a player who hangs around the basket a lot , " Brown says . " He pulls you away . I hate playing against him because he takes me away from my rebounding . I also like trying to be a help-side defender , but if he is pulling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the help side . If you try to , you leave him with an open 3-pointer . That 's dangerous . " He is very unorthodox that way . He just floats around the 3-point line . If you are an interior defender , you 'd like to keep an eye on Pierce 's penetration , too , but you ca n't . I am glad I only have to see him four times a year because he kills my rebounding numbers . " Walker was back home in Chicago a few days after last season ended . He was planning on doing what he usually does during the summer  --  relaxing and playing pickup games with other NBA players from the area , guys like Nazr Mohammed , Michael Finley and Juwan Howard . But he was invited to join Michael Jordan and trainer Tim Grover at a Chicago gym , to be part of a group of players who would help Jordan with his comeback . Once there , Walker not only worked on his game with Jordan , but did the first serious work on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed up for Celtics camp in good shape , more athletic and agile than ever . The physical change is not too significant , but it is part of the learning process that , so far , has taken Walker more than five frustrating years . Now 25 , he was just 19 when the Celtics drafted him after his sophomore season at Kentucky . He was named captain when he was 21 , at a time when he was proclaiming himself a " veteran All-Star , " a time when the juiciest chapters of the Antoine Chronicles were being written . " What happened with Antoine is that you could see how gifted a player he was , " says Celtics great and team broadcaster Tom Heinsohn . " But what transpired was that they threw leadership on him on top of that , and he was not ready to be a leader . But when he was a rookie , there were no veteran leaders to kind of say , Hey , kid , do n't act that way . ' " He was 20 , 21 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bird right away . He was not ready for that . And if you look at it , now , after 5 1/2 years on the pro scene , he is only two years older than Bird was as a rookie . He is becoming the same kind of leader . " There is room for improvement . Walker is so skilled , Heinsohn says , " His main problem is trying to figure out which skill to use at which time . " Sometimes he gets so bogged down in being a 3-point shooter that he neglects his passing . Sometimes he passes too much when he could be working the post more aggressively . Walker should take some advice from a guy who once had a similar problem . " You have to put the education of the game in your learning to where those skills supersede anyone you play against , " Jordan says . " The thing he is missing is the education of how to play with those athletic skills and make other players better . ... He 's got a hard head , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His head still is hard . It has taken Walker almost six years to get to this point , and further improvement could take a while , if it comes at all . If Jordan is right , and Walker does learn to be comfortable with his skill , if he does learn to make his teammates better , then like him or not , the Celtics will reap even greater benefits from their faith in Walker . Like him or not , he could be the guy who leads the Celtics back to their once-traditional perch atop the East . " Antoine is a leader in every sense of the word , " O'Brien says . " He is going to lead this team for a long , long time . " Author Affiliation Staff writer Sean Deveney covers the NBA for THE SPORTING NEWS . // <p>
