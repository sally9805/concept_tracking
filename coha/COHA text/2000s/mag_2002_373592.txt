Imagine an experiment in which a few hundred women with breast cancer are divided into two groups . Patients in one group have their tumors surgically removed , while those in the other wait patiently , keeping a close eye on the progress of their disease , and are treated only if their cancer starts to spread . Sound barbaric ? Substitute prostate cancer for breast cancer , and that is pretty much what 700 Scandinavian men in the early stages of prostate cancer agreed to . The results , published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week , showed that the men who underwent surgery were half as likely to die of prostate cancer as those in the " watchful waiting " group . <P> Predictable as that conclusion might seem , doctors consider the study a landmark . Physicians have debated for years how aggressively they should treat cancer of the prostate . Because the disease tends to be very slow growing , many more men will die with prostate cancer than from it . Nobody wants to undergo surgery or radiation treatment if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prostate cancer the side effects typically include impotence and incontinence . On the other hand , you do n't want to die of prostate cancer if you can help it . If the cancer spreads to the bones , it can be excruciatingly painful , and once it spreads , death is often unavoidable . <P> What does this mean for you ? The New England Journal study probably tilts the equation toward treatment  --  especially if you have early-stage prostate cancer and expect to live 10 more years . ( On average , it may take such a tumor , if it recurs , a decade or more after treatment to cause death . ) Watchful waiting probably makes more sense for older men , particularly if they are frail . <P> As with any other complex medical study , however , there are some tricky caveats . First off , prostate cancer is treated differently in Scandinavia , where watchful waiting is the norm , than it is in the U.S. Moreover , because Scandinavian men are not screened for prostate cancer as aggressively as American men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosis . And though the men in the surgery group were less likely to die of prostate cancer than the watchful waiters , it turned out there was no statistically significant difference in how long they lived . <P> Such a result is not as contradictory as it sounds . Given that follow-up averaged just over six years , it 's quite possible that the study did n't last long enough to show an appreciable difference in the two groups ' death rates . Even if it turns out that the men in the surgery group did n't live any longer and were merely spared death from prostate cancer , that 's quite an accomplishment , says Dr. Patrick Walsh at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore , Md. , who invented a widely used nerve-sparing prostate surgery . " If you had a choice of dying of prostate cancer vs. dying of a heart attack , " he says , " you 'd pick dying of a heart attack . " <P> Still unknown is whether screening someone for prostate cancer with blood tests that look for prostate-specific antigen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer . Studies designed to answer that question are under way . Until then , you will have to gather and weigh all the information you can when deciding how , or even whether , to treat prostate cancer . <P> For more information , search for " prostate " at
