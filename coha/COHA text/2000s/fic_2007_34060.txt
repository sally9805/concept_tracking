I opened my eyes to see the rat taking a piss in my coffee mug . It was a huge brown bastard ; had a body like a turd with legs and beady black eyes full of secret rat knowledge . Making a smug huffing sound , it threw itself from the table to the floor , and scuttled back into the hole in the wall where it had spent the last three months planning new ways to screw me around . I 'd tried nailing wood over the gap in the wainscot , but it gnawed through it and spat the wet pieces into my shoes . After that , I spiked bait with warfarin , but the poison seemed to somehow cause it to evolve and become a super-rat . I nailed it across the eyes once with a lucky shot with the butt of my gun , but it got up again and shat in my telephone . I dragged myself all the way awake , lurching forward in my office chair . The stink of rat urine steaming and festering in my mug stabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had coffee . I unstuck my backside from the sweaty leatherette of the chair , fought my way upright , and padded stiff-legged to the bathroom adjacent to my office . I knew that one of these days someone was going to burst into the office unannounced to find a naked private investigator taking a pisswith the bathroom door open . There was a time where I cared about that sort of thing . Some time before I started living in my own office , I think . My suit and shirt were piled on the plastic chair I use for clients . I stole it from a twenty-four-hour diner off Union Square , back in my professional drinking days . I picked up the shirt and sniffed it experimentally . It seemed to me that it 'd last another day before it had to be washed , although there was a nagging thought at the back of my mind that maybe it actually reeked and my sense of smell was shot . I held up the sleeve and examined the armpit . Slightly yellowish . But then , so was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the jacket on , anyway . I rifled the jacket for cigarettes , harvested one , and went back to my chair . I swabbed some of the nicotine scum off the window behind the chair with the edge of my hand and peered down at my little piece of Manhattan street . Gentrification had stopped dead several doors west of my spot overlooking Avenue B. You could actually see the line . That side of the line ; Biafran cuisine , sparkling plastic secure window units , women called Imogen and Saffron , men called Josh and Morgan . My side of the line ; crack whores , burned-out cars , bullets stuck in door frames , and men called Father-Eating Bastard . It 's almost a point of honor to live near a crackhouse , like living in a pre-Rudy Zone , a piece of Old New York . Across the street from me is the old building that the police sent tanks into , about five years back , to dislodge a community of squatters . The media never covered the guys in the crackhouse down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows , scabs dropping off their faces onto the heads of the rubberneckers down below , cheering the police on for getting those cheapass squatter motherfuckers off their block . You think the tanks ever came for the crackhouse ? Did they hell . I was new there , back then . All tingly with the notion of being a private detective in the big city . I was twenty-five , still all full of having been the child prodigy at the local desk of the main Pinkerton office in Chicago since I was twenty . But I was going to fly solo , do something less corporate and more real , make a difference in lives . It started going wrong on the second day , when the signpainter inscribing my name on the office door made a mistake and took off before I noticed . To the world at large I am now Michael Mgil Private Invest Gator . . It 's always the first line of a consultation . " No , it 's McGill . " Some asshole scraped the I out of investigator with their keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix that one . For all the work I get , I may as well be an invest gator . Every two days , I actually go down to the pay phone on the corner to call my own phone and leave a message on the answering machine to make sure it 's all still working . I do n't have a secretary . Sometimes I flip on a phone voice-changer I got for five bucks on eBay and pretend to be my own secretary . It is very sad . I blew stale-tasting cigarette smoke at the windowglass , looked down at people moving around the street , and debated what to do . I was fairly sure it was Saturday , so I did n't need to be there pretending I had a career . On the downside , I did n't have anywhere else to go . I could have coaxed my old laptop into life and gone on the Web to read about someone else 's life , but I feared my email . Maybe , I thought , it was time to leave the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell up . Kids were playing in the street , which is n't something I ever saw often from my window . I considered , and watched , reaching for my coffee mug by reflex as I idly chased trains of thought around my head . It occurs to me now that if I had n't seen the man in black on the far side of the street at that exact second , I would probably still be brushing my teeth with bleach . But I did . The absolute stereotypical man in black , with the shades and the earpiece and the stone face . And another , down the street . I leaned over . A third was outside the door to my building .
