For readers who missed the first part of this story last month , we 'll bring you up to speed with a synopsis . For those of you who have been waiting , here you go presented without commercial interruption , it 's the conclusion of Guth Bandar 's current story arc . <p> THE STORY SO FAR THE NONAUT GUTH Bandar has always longed to travel the Swept , a vast prairie known for its brillion mines and dangerous wildlife , that is also the battleground where , long ago , an invasion by a horde of telepathic insectoid aliens known as the Dree was defeated . Finally afforded the opportunity , Guth rides a balloon-tram to Farflung , where he will board the landship Orgulon , on behalf of a fictitious brother who suffers from the lassitude - the first new fatal disease in millennia to strike Old Earth . He almost immediately runs into a pair of fellow travelers who also only pretend to have the disease ; though Guth meets them as Phlevas Wasselthorpe and his mentor Erenti Abbas , he eventually learns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imbry . The two undercover scroots are out to apprehend the notorious confidence trickster Horslan Gebbling , who has hired the Orgulon and offered a free cruise for victims of the lassitude . During their journey , Guth teaches Harkless about the noosphere , and the scroot demonstrates an uncanny - and dangerous - affinity for navigating the Commons , which prompts Guth to want nothing more to do with the young man , who he fears may be absorbed and tipped into permanent psychosis . But when his attempts to escape Baro 's company are thwarted , Guth suspects that their fates are entwined and that he is being inexorably pressed into the role of Helper to Harkless 's archetypal Sacrificial Hero . The Orgulon 's security officer , Raina Haj , had earlier prevented anyone from leaving after a passenger plunged to his death from the foredeck of the landship . Now , with Guth , Baro , Imbry , and four other , passengers stranded in the vast emptiness of the Swept , that death is revealed to be cold-blooded murder . And the murderer is about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AS THE MURDERER 'S thumb touched the control , the grass behind him opened and the missing Rover burst into the clearing , running at a four-legged gallop low to the ground . He rose to his hind legs and leapt to smash bodily into the officer 's back , sending him sprawling . Then Yaffak rolled clear and came smoothly to his hind feet , ready to strike again . Harkless and Imbry , the two undercover Bureau of Scrutiny agents , sprang forward . So did Haj . But the villain had the almost admirable concentration Bandar had seen before in persons with psyches dominated by darker elements . He was already levering himself to his knees and aiming the energy pistol . It discharged just as Harkless struck him with a flying tackle , and its concentrated beam of force sliced the air like a long thin blade . Then it was over . The man was face down on the ground , his wrists pinioned by a restraint , and Haj had secured both pistols . Yaffak took a brief look at the defeated prisoner , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shuggras from where they crouched in the long grass . He quickly rehitched their harness to the cart . They pulled the killer to his feet . He gave them a look that expressed no apology . They prepared to board the gig but the fat agent - Imbry , Bandar recalled , was his name - had discovered that the long discharge of the energy pistol had disabled its controls . They would have to press on by Rover cart . Haj enlisted Bandar to translate as she asked the Rover to take them east to where the day camp was set up . " No , " saidYaffak . Now Imbry had a question . He pointed to the bound man and wanted to know why Yaffak had attacked him . " For the Good Man , " Yaffak said , his eyes going to Harkless . Harkless said , " Why for me ? " Yaffak struggled to express his thoughts . " In the other place , the bad thing , the bad rope . Good Man come , cut rope , make me free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Good Man ? " Yaffak sniffed loudly and described Harkless 's odor in terms that only a Rover truly understood . Bandar translated for the others . The young agent wanted to know what Yaffak thought had restrained him in the dream . The Rover did not want to talk about it . The loose skin on his shoulders shook and his ruff rose in agitation . " He lacks the words , " Bandar said . " To him it was just a bad dream . " Harkless asked if the Rover would take him where the other Rovers had carried the other passengers . Yaffak looked down and to the side . Bandar translated the posture as one of the Rovers " ways of saying no . Then Yaffak said to Harkless , " Come west , hunt skippit . Big food . Good fun . " " I must go to the others , " Harkless said . Bandar was amazed to see the Rover 's face take on a look of unwilling resolution . " For you , Yaffak goes east . Take people not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the bound prisoner . " Leave killer , let eaters find . " Bandar translated . Ule Gazz began to protest but Harkless cut her off . Bandar saw the Hero 's determination glowing in the young man 's eyes as he told Yaffak that the sick must go with them . " Not sick , " Yaffak said . " Sick is belly pain , food comes up . These not sick . Smell wrong . " Harkless asked the others if Rovers got the lassitude . No one knew . He spoke again to Yaffak . " Did your pack smell like these ? " Yaffak struggled to express himself . " Rovers smell like Rovers , not do like Rovers . Yaffak see them wrong but not feel them wrong . Then Yaffak in bad place , Good Man come , free Yaffak . Then see and feel Rovers wrong . Yaffak angry-scared , run to grass . " Bandar translated as best he could , then added his view that Yaffak had had a traumatic experience and did not want to meet the " wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rover would take them to within sight of the mining town of Victor , he would not ask him to go near his packmates . Yaffak said , " For Good Man , will do . " And he must take the sick , the young agent insisted . " Not sick , wrong , " Yaffak insisted , but then lowered his head . " He agrees to take them , too , " Bandar said . Flix 's body went into the gig , secure from predators under a locked canopy . The rest reboarded the cart , laying the first officer face down in the aisle between the seats . Bandar sat in his former seat near the front so that he could translate if required . The two agents sat nearby and soon fell into a discussion with Raina Haj regarding their pursuit of the confidence trickster posing as Father Olwyn . The conversation led nowhere , since none could envision how the fraudster stood to gain from mounting an expensive cruise for lassitude sufferers who were , for the most part , not wealthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brillion . Bandar also learned that Haj was herself an undercover agent of the Bureau of Scrutiny who had been in pursuit of the man lying on the floor . The Orgulon 's first officer - his name was Kosmir - had been involved in some complex scheme to murder Flix 's companion , once a celebrated artist but whose reputation had faded , in order to drive up the value of the man 's works . Flix , it seemed , had been his unwitting dupe . None of this meant much to Bandar . He focused not on the back-and-forth between the officers , nor on UIe Gazz 's futile attempts to defend Olwyn , but on Baro Harkless . Earlier , he had called him narrow and strange , and had formed the impression that the young man had grown up peculiar . He seemed to be missing not only common knowledge , but certain elements of a normal personality . His being a Bureau agent explained nothing . He is too simple , the nonaut thought . His psyche is not the subtle blend of tints and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of elements . It is as if he has been painted only in primary colors . Bandar had studied naturals in his undergraduate years at the Institute . This Harkless was not quite like those loons , even though it was obvious to a nonaut 's eye that the Hero archetype was growing increasingly dominant within him . It was there to be seen in the gleam of the eye and the set of the jaw . No , not a natural . But not quite a fully rendered human , either . He was hypothesizing rare neuronic disorders caused by accidents in the womb , when the picture suddenly fell into focus . He played back in his memory the young man 's interaction with the other agents and the passengers , and particularly how he had behaved with Bandar himself . Now he remembered his first impression of Harkless , when he and Imbry had come aboard the balloon-tram : he had reminded Bandar of the idiomatic entities that populated the Locations of the Commons . If that were so , it meant that where normal human beings had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans had personalities , he had only a selection of interconnected characteristics . It was debatable whether the young man was a person at all , or just a facsimile of one . Bandar had never felt empathy for idiomats he had encountered in the Commons . But for an idiomat loose in the waking world , Bandar had to feel sympathy . What a strange growing up it must have been , like being able to see only black and white while navigating a world whose directional signs were all color coded . After a while , the cart left the Swept and drove up a sloping ramp of stone onto the Monument . This was a vast assemblage of close-fitted blocks of gray rock that formed the image of a man 's helmeted head and neck , so large that it was easily visible from near orbit . It was said to be the likeness of the commander whose strategy had defeated the Dree . The mining town of Victor , near the Monument 's southeast extremity , was also believed to have been named for him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height . Travelers who ascended to its upper surface found a great plain of featureless rock , with here and there a growth of hardy grass or thorny brush sprouting from cracks and fissures opened by the alternation over eons of winter cold and summer heat . They were crossing at the Monument 's narrowest stretch , the neck , and Yaffak was whipping his shuggras along . Soon they would reach the down-ramp that sloped back onto the prairie , and shortly thereafter they should come to the day camp where the Orgulon would meet them . The mystery of the murder being concluded , Bandar intended to make strong representations to be allowed to leave immediately . Harkless touched his shoulder and he turned . " I offended you and I am sorry , " the young agent said . " I am surprised that I have attracted the Hero , since I have surely spent my Ufe playing the Fool . " Bandar felt a upsurge of feeling for the unhappy youth . " You did nothing that was ill-meant , " he said . " Perhaps I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then made an unexpected proposal . " When this business is done , might you consider taking me as a student nonaut ? The Commons does draw me . " " You would leave the Bureau of Scrutiny ? " Harkless referred to a conversation he had had with his panner , Imbry . " He believes that , in life , some are called , and some are driven . Until now , it appears that I have been one of the driven . Now I have found something that calls me . " Again , Bandar felt an urge to help the young man and his first instinct was to fight it . But when he looked into the unhappy face he saw no glint of the Hero , just a lost and lonely child . And then a thought occurred : a nonaut with the power to move between Commonses would be an unparalleled innovation . Whole new schools might open . Bandar imagined returning to the Institute like a thunderclap . His attention was drawn to a faint sound from the rear of the can . UIe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she struggled to chant the ta-tumpa , ta-tey , but could produce only a dry croaking . Across the aisle from her , Poilus Ermatage had also fallen silent . She reached to touch Gazz 's jaw , then felt her own throat . When she spoke , her voice was weak : " UIe Gazz has the lassitude . As do I. " Bandar raised his fingers to his own neck and jaw . Nothing seemed amiss , but his determination to leave grew stronger . They reached the far side of the Monument 's neck and saw the town of Victor out on the Swept . It was a small , unpretentious mining town , with a scattering of buildings linked by a few paved roads beneath the elevated structures that marked where the shafts of two almost-played-out brillion mines descended into the Earth . Beyond the town , at a flattened berm of tailings that served as a landship wharf , stood the Orgulon . Just south of the wharf , Rovertown began , a sprawl of unpretentious habitations where the Rovers lived in close proximity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even the newly stricken lassitude sufferers seemed to show hope . But from his seat at the front of the cart , Yaffak snuffled the air and pointed with his nose . " Dead eaters , " he said . Bandar told the others that the Rover had spotted a flock of stingwhiffles between them and Victor . A congregation of the leathery-winged carrion eaters meant something lay dead on the prairie . They found a ramp leading down onto the Swept and descended . The stingwhiffles were contending over something in the grass not far off the cart trail that went toward Victor . Haj 's voice took on a worried note . " The tents and tables were set up there . Olwyn was about to go into his act when I left to find you people . " They came to a place where the grass was flattened . Upturned folding tables and shreds of fabric lay scattered about , the buffet table and its heaps of truffle cuisine tipped over . Yaffak pulled up and the three agents dismounted . Bandar followed them but paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woolly claw ? " The Rover 's nose winnowed the air and he turned to scan in every direction . The muscles of his neck twitched and his ruff stood erect , but he said , " No . " Haj set her pistol for wide dispersal and swept a beam of yellow energy through the circling stingwhiffles . The gaggle that had been squabbling over whatever was on the ground burst into the air in a squawking cloud of leather . Bandar hung back and said , " What is there ? " " It is that white-haired woman from the landship , " Harkless said . He knelt to examine the remains . Bandar came up behind him . Brand Halorn 's flesh was torn by long , deep wounds and her head was halfsevered from her neck . " That is not the work of stingwhiffles , " he said . Haj thought it might have been a woollyclaw , but if so , the people of nearby Victor would be out in force . " And what of this ? " said Imbry . He had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leather . He held it up then almost retched as he realized what it was : a human skin , split open along the spine and with ribbons of flesh where the hands and feet should have been . Bandar recognized its owner . " The birthmark , " he said . " It is her husband . " " This is not a woollyclaw 's doing , " said Haj . She searched the grass . " His clothes are here , torn to pieces , and his skin . But where is the body ? Where is the blood ? " Harkless said , " We should go into town . This place is not safe . " But Imbry counseled against it . The town was silent when its inhabitants should have been astir . Haj exerted her seniority . She had one of the landships " short-range communicators and now sought to contact the Orgulon . But the signal could not get through . She tried her Bureau of Scrutiny plaque , a more sophisticated instrument , but again it was as if the frequency was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and declared that she would walk to the Orgulon , circling around the town . The captain was a capable man and would be able to tell her the situation . Someone was shouting , back where Yaffak had remained with his cart . Bandar and the agents hurried there to find that the noise came from the prisoner Kosmir . The Rover was hauling him from the vehicle . The two couples who had succumbed to the lassitude were lying in a row in the grass . UIe Gazz was struggling to get her feet under her , but the disease was rapidly stealing her mobility ; the other three lay motionless , and Bandar saw that Ebersol and Sooke , who had caught the disease first , had reached the stage of stark rigidity and polished skin , as if they had been waxed . Their eyes were as stone . Yaffak set Kosmir upright , then turned back to the cart to bring out the two come-alongs . He closed and locked the tailboard . Raina Haj confronted the Rover and demanded to know his intent . Yaffak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrong smell , all over . Town , these . " He gestured at the lassitude victims . " Yaffak goes . " Bandar translated . Haj told the Rover they would skirt the town and go to the landship . Yaffak said , " Yaffak goes . " Haj looked grim and drew her energy pistol . Yaffak did not flinch . " Shooting bad . Some things more bad . Yaffak goes . " Haj reholstered the weapon . The Rover made to climb into the driver 's seat , but instead he turned toward Harkless . " Good Man come with Yaffak . Safe . " Bandar translated and saw in the agent 's eyes a response to the Rover 's obvious affection . But then the nonaut saw the Hero harden Harkless 's young face . " I can not , " Harkless said . " Something else calls me . " Yaffak mounted the cart , turned the team back toward the Monument , and with one backward regretful glance , he was gone . The three agents now fell into a procedural argument about who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted from manuals while Haj looked uncomfortable and made remarks about risking her career . Bandar paid no attention . He studied the four lassitude victims . All the chanting and chuff e raising had done nothing to address the conditions of those who boarded the Oigulon already in the clutch of the disease ; if anything , it seemed to have hurried them to the crisis , worse , those who had not had the disease to begin with had developed galloping cases . He wondered if that result , rather than a cure , had been the intent of the cruise . Was Father Olwyn , or Horslan Gebbling , actively promoting the spread of the disease , possibly out of some apocalyptic motive ? Bandar had seen many versions of the Mad Messiah preserved in the Locations of the Commons . Could Olwyn be psychically captive to such a dangerous archetype ? Might a cult have sprung up around his charismatic presence , a millennial sect out to bring on the end of the world through pestilence ? If so , the chanting would not have had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters amplified the disease 's onslaught , as if they transferred spores back and forth to each other and .... And then it struck him : the other common factor had been the truffles of the Swept ; they had been the main ingredient in almost every dish that had come out of the landship 's galley , even the gruel fed to the ill . Bandar had not cared for the taste and had eaten little of it . He was , as much as he could tell , unvisited by the lassitude . He was pursuing this line of inquiry when he heard Harkless speak his name . " Bandar and I will tend to the sick , " the agent had said . The nonaut regarded the earnest young face and saw more than mere traces of the Hero in his expression of stern resolve . And the cavalier way he had included Bandar in his plan was exactly the manner in which a Hero assumed decisions for his Helper . Still , Bandar would be of no use in an expedition to the town or the landship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rovers have succumbed2 , he thought ; he knew little of whatever piety they might practice - Bandar would rather stay on the Monument . That was where they earned the paralyzed , Harkless and Haj slinging the still bendable Gazz and Ermatage over their shoulders while Imbry and Bandar towed Ebersol and Sooke on their come-alongs . Kosmir walked ahead of the party , with Harkless 's energy pistol trained on him . Back atop the Monument , they laid the four paralytics on the sun-warmed stone . The three agents used their plaques to inspect the deserted streets of Victor and Rovertown . They saw evidence of violence and the discharge of energy weapons , conferring about these matters in low voices . But Bandar could hear enough ; he would stay out of the town . Haj left to make her way to the landship . Harkless ordered the prisoner to sit apart from the sick . " If you try to stand I will shoot you in the leg , " he said , then turned to Bandar . " Shout if he moves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clearly from the Hero to the Helper . Harkless and Imbry went to look at the four lassitude victims . Imbry thought the crisis would soon be upon them . Harkless knelt beside UIe Gazz , then expressed surprise that apparently she continued to try to chant Olwyn 's last mantra . He took off his Institute scarf and folded it to make a pad under Poilus Ermatage 's head . The two agents left the sick and returned to where Bandar watched Kosmir . " If whatever attacked that loud woman comes for us , " the prisoner said , " I would be more use without this restraint . " Harkless would not hear of it . " You will take your chances as you are , " he said , reminding the prisoner that he had seen him kill FUx after murdering her companion for financial gain . Kosmir quoted an unflattering saying about the likelihood of securing mercy from a scroot . Harkless sighted along his pistol and said , " In an emergency , you would be even more hampered by the loss of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kosmir . " I 'm increasingly sure that I will if you do not stop talking . " Bandar heard the tone even stronger now . The young man was slipping ever more firmly into the grip of the Hero . They sat without talking , Harkless watching the town while Bandar watched Harkless . After a while , the noonaut sought to probe the extent to which the agent was affected . He chose an indirect line of inquiry . " The call you said you felt , might it be a vocation to explore the Commons ? " Harkless mulled the question then said that something about the nosphere called to him . A moment later , he clarified his answer : something in the nosphere was calling him , though he knew not what called nor what he was called to do . Bandar admitted to being conflicted . It delighted him that Harkless 's strange facility for the Commons might open up new avenues of research . But he did not like to think that he had been an instrument to put the young man in peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The instrument is never responsible , only the hand that employs it . " Besides , if it was his fate to be where he was , then perhaps it was also Bandar 's . The calm with which he accepted the possibility of imminent doom was quintessentially that of the Hero Sacrificial , Bandar saw . Moment by moment , there was less and less of Baro Harkless , and more and more of the archetype . Bandar said , " It would pain me to think that my life-long love of the nosphere has been not truly of my own will but just a part of some grand plot . " Harkless paid no attention . The nonaut watched as an intense stillness came over the young man 's face . He sat staring at nothing for a long while and Bandar saw the grim certitude of the Hero gain a stronger hold . Suddenly the young man 's eyes went wide and he said , " What ? " and looked at Kosmir as if he thought the prisoner had spoken , though Bandar knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The agent now turned to Bandar and said , " Did you speak to me ? " " No . " Bandar kept his voice even , but it worried him that the young fellow was now hearing a voice . That was a long step beyond merely being influenced by an archetype . He sought to plant an antidote to the growing poisoning of the young man 's psyche by the Hero by offering another archetype as a focus for Harkless 's thoughts . Because to name was to summon , Bandar deliberately chose the most effective counter to the Hero , saying , " The voice probably came from the Wise Man . " Bandar saw speculation in the agent 's eyes . Good , he thought , Heroes do not speculate . He was searching for a way to keep the process rolling when Kosmir announced that he had something important to say . Immediately , Bandar saw the Hero resurge within the young man . Harkless pointed the pistol at Kosmir 's foot and said , " I do not care to be interrupted when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is something the scroots need to know . " The Hero looked out through Harkless 's eyes with characteristic disdain for a villain . He heard the Hero 's voice tell Kosmir he had other " concerns . The prisoner said he had information about a serious crime . The Hero 's mouth set in a skeptical sneer . " More serious than a double murder ? " " Yes . " " Bandar saw Harkless dismiss the subject . The Hero was now back in control and had larger issues to occupy him . Bandar was growing increasingly frightened . They were stranded up here on the bare rock with an armed man who was visibly sinking into the clutches of an archetype . And who was certain to look upon the nonaut as his fated Helper . " You are Haj 's prisoner , " the agent told Kosmir . " Reveal all to her when she comes back . " Kosmir had a villain 's cunning and knew the right thing to say to the Hero . " She may not be coming back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jolt pass through Harkless at the mention of a damsel in distress . Harkless leapt to his feet and brought out his plaque , trying to reach Haj through the short-range emergency frequency . A few undecipherable squawks overlaid by static was all the answer he received . The agent turned back to Kosmir and Bandar saw the Hero 's singlemindedness plain in his young face and heard the Hero 's uncompromising voice say , " Tell me . " Kosmir made the mistake of trying to bargain . He wanted the charges dropped and to keep his ill-gotten gains . But a Hero did not haggle and the prisoner now compounded his error by assuming that he was dealing with a sane scroot . He made demands . The Hero simply discharged the energy pistol into the rock immediately in front of Kosmir 's crossed legs . Instantly , the prisoner 's calves were splattered with white-hot molten rock . The man shrieked and fell back onto his pinioned arms , frantically rubbing his legs against each other , trying to remove the lava from his smoldering flesh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if he found the terms satisfactory . Bandar said , " That was unnecessarily cruel . " Typical of a Hero approaching the crisis , Harkless paid the Helper no heed . He put his thumb on the weapon 's activation stud and said , " Well ? " Kosmir announced that he would tell all . Harkless gestured with the pistol to suggest that he do so quickly . Kosmir began to talk , telling an involved tale about having overheard one side of a conversation involving Gebbling . He had not been able to hear the other communicant 's voice , but he had heard enough to make out the elements of a plot to spread the lassitude , which was apparently somehow caused by eating truffles of the Swept . Bandar did not pay close attention ; he was more concerned with the obvious transformation that was overcoming young Baro Harkless . There was less and less of Harkless left to see in the face that confronted Kosmir , and the hand that held the pistol did not waver . Bandar said , " Ask the Wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with his interrogation . Bandar repeated his words , but now he was sure that no one was there to hear them . Kosmir tried to hold back some crucial element of what he knew , to keep something he might trade to his advantage . The Hero aimed the pistol and offered to burn off his feet . Kosmir talked on . Finally the Hero that had filled Harkless was satisfied . It had Harkless take out his Bureau of Scrutiny plaque and again try to contact Ha ) . This time , there was a reply , but not from the missing sergeant . Instead , a new voice spoke from the air , announcing that this was a restricted frequency and demanding to know who was using it . " Baro Harkless , agent ordinary . " The words came from the agent 's mouth , but Bandar could hear the Hero speaking them . The voice from the air identified itself as that of Directing Agent Ardmander Arboghast of the Bureau of Scrutiny . Harkless reported to him that he believed Raina Ha ) was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered the source of the lassitude . Arboghast told him that everything was now secure and asked for his location . Harkless told him where he and the others were and that they had four people critically ill with the disease . Arboghast ordered him to remain where he was ; help was on the way . Harkless looked down at Kosmir with the uncompromising stare of the Hero . " The Bureau knows everything , " he said . " You have nothing to bargain with . " A sly look had crept over Kosmir . He said , " I have something now . " Harkless said he could try it on the senior scroot when he got there . The prisoner said , " This is something you need to know , and before he arrives . " Baro took out the pistol again . " Shall I burn off a toe ? " Kosmir affected an air of unconcern and told Harkless he could shoot if he wished . The pain would not last long . Bandar saw puzzlement in the Hero 's face . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mocked him with a simpering expression . " I say it because none of us here has long to live , not me , not you , nor those sick lumps , unless you listen to what I can tell you . " Harkless looked over at where the lassitude sufferers lay inert . Olleg Ebersol was having trouble breathing . Imbry struggled up from where he was sitting and went over to him . . Bandar saw Harkless 's face reflect the pity that the Hero reflexively showed toward helpless victims . Then he saw it harden back into a grim mask as the Hero turned back to Kosmir . The pistol did not waver as it came to bear on the prisoner 's feet . " Tell me , or die one piece at a time . " Bandar tried to reason with the archetype . " It is evil to torture a prisoner . " The Hero turned toward the noonaut and in the glitter of his eyes Bandar saw only the faintest trace of the young man Harkless , and heard almost nothing but pure archetype in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is evil . I do what is necessary . " Some of Harkless was still there , but what little was left of him was sinking rapidly . Bandar made an attempt to reach him . " You are allowing yourself to be absorbed by an archetype , to be made into a simple-minded monster . Fight it . " The nonaut saw a gleam of a response deep in the unblinking eyes , but then the Hero 's voice said , " I do not wish to fight it . " He looked back at Kosmir with casual coldness and aimed the weapon . Bandar stood up and sang eight notes . It was a subthran that interfered with the perceptions of a specific subset of the Hero archetype that included the Hero Sacrificial - interfered with them in the Commons , that is . He had no idea if the sequence would have any effect in the waking world , but he could think of nothing else to do . He continued to sing the eight notes , over and over again . The Hero looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandar saw Baro Harkless re-emerge . The young man blinked and said , " I have broken through . Thank you . " " You must continue to fight its influence , " said Bandar . Harkless said he would try . He bent and helped Kosmir sit upright . " Whatever you were holding back , tell me now , " he said . " I will if you first free me , " Kosmir said , his eyes searching the sky to the east over Victor and the Rovers " town . " But there is no time to waste . " " If the information is truly important , I promise to free you . " But Kosmir was not a man to trust a scroot , especially one who had moments before given him a convincing display of madness . Nor did Harkless have cause to trust the prisoner . " We have reached an impasse , " Harkless said . " An impasse that will not last , " said Kosmir . He pointed with his chin to the vehicle that had risen above the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After will be too late . " Bandar looked and saw an official scroot volante . Harkless saw it too . Now Kosmir was pleading , scootching around on his buttocks to present his restrained arms to Harkless . " You are trying to trick me , " Harkless said . " I think he is not , " Bandar said . " His fear seems genuine . " " He has reason to be afraid . That aircar will take him on a journey that ends in the contemplarium . " Kosmir was frantic . " No , the aircar brings death to all of us ! " The thrum of the aircar 's gravity obviators grew louder . Harkless chewed his lip as he regarded the prisoner , then Bandar saw that the scroot had made his decision . The agent reset the weapon 's controls . He aimed it at the holdtight . The gargling noise from Ebersol was growing louder . It drew Harkless 's attention to where the four inert sufferers lay , tended by Luff Imbry . " They are coming to the catharsis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering . " " Ignore them ! " Kosmir said . " Release me ! " Harkless directed a pulse of energy into the restraint 's control center . The holdtight broke open and clattered onto the rock . Kosmir leapt to his feet , swinging his arms to bring the blood back into his hands . " Set your pistol on maximum ! " he said . " When the aircar tries to land , shoot it down ! " Harkless gave him a skeptical look and made no move to adjust the weapon 's setting . Kosmir spoke frantically - " No time ! " and sought to seize the pistol . Harkless pushed him back , and the man stumbled and fell . " Now who is mad ? " the young man said . " It is a Bureau of Scrutiny aircar and its operator is Ardmander Arboghast , my section chief ! " Kosmir put his hands together in the posture of the Reformed Penitent . Bandar had seen the archetype in many a Class Two Situation and believed the man 's emotion to be genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you everything ! " Kosmir said . " I was holding back something to bargain with - that I did hear the voice of the man who was the mastermind behind the lassitude . I did not know his name but I know that his voice was the same as that of the man you spoke with on your commuicator . Whoever he is , he is responsible for scores of deaths , and he will surely kill us all ! " " No ! " Harkless said , " you are trying to trick us ! " Bandar was only half aware of what was going on between the scroot and the pleading prisoner . His eyes were on the four lassitude sufferers . He tugged on the young agent 's sleeve . " Baro ! " he cried . The young man swung around and looked to the sky behind them , where the noise of the aircar grew louder . " No , " said Bandar , " look there ! " A cold wave of horror crept up his back and he pointed at where the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sooke 's torso was also rising from the rock . But it was all wrong . Human beings do n't move that way , Bandar thought . Nor do they bend that way . Neither the man nor the woman had bent at the waist , but their upper torsos had levered themselves upright at the point where ribs met diaphragm , the small of the back staying flat on the ground . It should n't have happened without bones snapping , but the only sound was a sighing intake and release of breath , remarkably calm . Now Olleg Ebersol 's head turned left then right , rotating almost until his chin went past each shoulder . His arms rose and extended straight out , as if he were reaching for something in the air before him . The man 's hands seemed to elongate , the fingers stretching to an impossible length . Then the skin at the fingertips burst , falling back in strips like ribbons , and from them emerged a bundle of dark green sticks , jointed in several places , that unrolled and flexed themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Ebersol 's head . Bandar saw the man 's skin slide down his arms like loose cuffs , but where bones and flesh should have been exposed was a thick length of the same dark green material , shiny and hard-surfaced as an arthropod 's limb . The stick-like digits dug into the flesh at the back of the neck and with a sound like the tearing of coarse cloth the skin of the head was torn away . Where Ebersol 's face had been was a featureless rounded oblong of the same dark green , glistening like a beetle 's wingcase . Two fern-like antennae unrolled themselves and began to turn as if sampling the air . Now the claws went again to the skin at the back of the neck and the jointed arms exerted a great strength . Ebersol 's clothing split down the back , and with it the skin along his spine also parted . A hard-shelled thorax emerged , then a segmented abdomen , long and cylindrical , finally a pair of lower limbs from which thorn-like spikes sprouted . Bandar 's first thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " That is a Dree . " The sound of his voice caused the eyeless head to rotate toward him . The tendrils quivered and leaned in his direction . The thing 's multidigited hands and feet underwent a transformation , the spiky appendages suddenly clicking together , each fitting tightly into its neighbors to form solid , curved claws . Bandar looked at those wicked edges and remembered the wounds on Brond Halorn 's body . This is a coincidence , he thought , and the word brought with it all of its terrifying import to a noonaut . All of this-the lassitude , the Dree , the strange young man called to the Commons - they were all part of one great story , a story being acted out not in the theater of the noosphere , but in the waking world . And , for this story , Guth Bandar could not be a detached observer , he must be an active participant . A second Dree had already torn its way out of what had been Corje Sooke . It stood , its clawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free their spikes of the woman 's hampering skin . Its antennae questioned the air . Between it and the creature that had come out of Olleg Ebersol , Luff Imbry still knelt where he had been ministering to what they had thought were the dying . Now , as the creatures loomed over him , he scrambled to his feet but stumbled as he tried to put distance between himself and the Dree . Harkless shouted to him to stand clear and aimed the energy pistol at the one that was already on its feet . But now the first Dree also sprang up , its tendrils quivering toward the sound of the young man 's voice . Its hind legs flexed and it flung itself at Harkless . The ziw of the energy pistol was accompanied by a beam of focused force that caught the Dree in the air , burning a hole the size of a fist through its thorax . The thing fell clattering to the rock , its momentum carrying it skidding almost to Harkless 's feet . The second Dree was still seeking to disengage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already reached out to snag Imbry 's robe , jerking him back as he tried to flee . The fat man twisted around , frantically pulling at the fasteners , trying to free himself from the garment . The cloth enveloped his head . Bandar looked to Harkless and saw that the Hero had come back into the young man 's face . Well , if there ever was a time for a Hero ... , the nonaut thought . The young agent calmly aimed the pistol at the Dree that was attacking his partner . But as his thumb moved to the discharge control , Bandar heard him gasp in agony and looked down to see that the first Dree , though dying , had sunk a talon into the flesh of the young man 's calf and was raising a second clawed limb to open his belly . Harkless 's pierced leg collapsed under him , but even as he fell he placed the weapon against the Dree 's faceless head and fired . The green smoothness blackened , then exploded . Harkless yanked its claw from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fat agent had not been able to pull free of his garment before the Dree had disentangled itself from Corje Sooke 's shed skin . The man had fallen heavily onto his face , and now the creature was upon him , its powerful hind legs ready to rip him apart . Harkless fired the pistol into the Dree in a sustained discharge that obliterated its head and upper body . But Imbry did not stir . " I will tend to him , " Bandar said . " You must deal with the other two . " The lumps that had been UIe Gazz and Poilus Ermatage were twitching the way the first two had fust before the emergence . The Hero looked at him through Harkless 's eyes . " You opposed me , " it said . A chill went through Bandar , but he thought fast . " I am your Helper . It is my duty to oppose you when I see you go the wrong way . " The eyes held on him for a long moment , then the Hero nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Imbry lay , pulled back the cloth from the head . Bandar came with him . " see , he lives , " the nonaut said . " Now kill the other Dree before they emerge . " The Hero knelt , adjusting the weapon to maximum discharge and aimed at the jerking chrysalises that had been Gazz and Ermatage . The thrumming of a powerful aircar was suddenly loud all round them , and the wind of its bowfront wave swept over the scene . Bandar turned to see a Bureau of Scrutiny volante alighting almost upon them . A man of mature years stepped from the vehicle . He wore the green and black uniform of a Bureau officer and a face that made Bandar 's heart sink . This one , too , is fully in the grip of an archetype , he thought . And it looked to be one of the worst : the Tyrant . The Hero glanced back at the new arrival as the scroot officer took from a belt holster the standard Bureau sidearm : a shocker . The Hero turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think your weapon will do more than subdue them temporarily . They are a deadly offworld species . " " I know , " said the Tyrant in black and green . Then it raised the shocker and shot the young man . The Hero fell senseless to the ground and the Tyrant stepped nimbly forward and seized the energy pistol . It aimed the weapon at Bandar and said , " If you want to live , do as I say . " Bandar indicated that he would accept the suggestion , but first indicated the prone Luff Imbry . " I think this man is only stunned , " he said . " Leave him , but bring the young one . " Bandar knew better than to argue and went to where Harkless lay . The Tyrant turned to where Kosmir had stood , frozen with fear , during the violence . " You , help him . " But the landship officer was in the grip of terror . He said something unintelligible then turned and ran , heading west out onto the expanse of the Monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then lowered it . It turned a cruel face toward Bandar and said , " Hurry , they will soon emerge , " then helped the nonaut drag Harkless 's unconscious form to the aircar . They manhandled him into the prisoner 's compartment ; then the Tyrant ordered Bandar in after him . " There are bandages and restorative in the first-aid kit , " it said , before climbing into the operator 's position and Ufting the volante into the air . They hovered at a low height in silent mode . Bandar watched through the transparent canopy as the last two Dree lipped themselves free . They stood , digits opening and closing into claws , their tendrils straining toward the two charred corpses . Then a distant sound caught their attention and , as one , their faceless heads and questing antennae turned west . Far out on the Monument the tiny figure of the landship officer ran . Kosmir 's legs pumped with fear-fueled energy , his arms pistoning tight against his sides . Bandar saw the Dree tense and crouch . Then each sprang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice their body length . They landed on limbs like springs and the second leap carried them even farther than their first . They bounded across the flat rock , hardly seeming to touch the surface before they were in the air again . Kosmir might as well have been standing still for all the good that running did him . The Tyrant eased the volante forward , cruising above and behind the leaping Dree , so that Bandar was an eyewitness to what happened when they caught the man . One sprang onto the officer 's back , sinking the claws of its forelimbs into the muscles of his shoulders while its heavy hind legs , with their great curved claws , shredded the flesh from Kosmir 's legs . The second Dree had leaped neatly over its sibling and its prize , turning in the air so that it landed on its back right in front of Kosmir , its claws raised to receive him . Sandwiched between the two of them , he screamed for a long time before they tore something vital . " Instinctive behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they feed . " Bandar thought it was talking to itself , then remembered that this archetype always enjoyed seeing its self-worth reflected in the awe of another . " You 're right , " he said . Bandar looked down and saw that a ventral slit had opened in the abdomen of each Dree . Their claws were ripping free pieces of Kosmir and cramming them into the openings . Something like teeth flashed as they shredded the raw meat . " Now they rest , " said the Tyrant when the feeding was done . It landed the volante near the Dree , unlocked the prisoners " compartment , and beckoned Bandar out . The nonaut was frightened but the creatures seemed to have become dormant . The Tyrant adjusted the shocker 's setting and turned it on the Dree . They toppled over and lay on their backs like dead insects . " We 'll put them in the cargo bay , " the Tyrant said . THEY OVERFLEW VICTOR at rooftop height . Bodies lay in the streets - mostly human , though Bandar saw one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what must have happened : the Rovers , with their less complex minds , would have been the first to be mentally enslaved . The Dree would have made them get their hunting weapons and come up from Rovertown at night in a coordinated strike . Victor had no Bureau of Scrutiny detachment ; it would have been quickly overrun , its population captured and put under guard . But how could there be a Dree to enslave anyone ? They had been wiped out eons before , traced back to their home world and brutally expunged . Bandar believed he knew how : the Swept was home to extreme gravitational anomalies ; gravity was necessary for the formation of nospheres ; was it possible that the Dree equivalent of a collective unconscious had been captured by the aggregator that had crushed the invaders , had been carried intact down to the core of Old Earth and been reflected back in a process that occurred over geological time ? Bandar had to assume it was possible because that was the only way it could have happened . And now the anomaly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within range of humans and Rovers . But how had the lassitude sufferers been transformed into Dree ? It appeared that the original invaders had had a secret : they had not bred , as had been assumed , by laying eggs to be tended by enslaved species . So powerful was the Dree hive mind that it could alter the very gene plasm of its captives , with a chemical assist from a particular fungus grown in the hives . The Dree fed its captives truffles of the Swept , then exerted its immense psychic powers against the most intimate constituents of their cells , transforming them into replicas of itself . Those who did not eat the fungus but came under the spell of the Dree fell into the lassitude . When the transformative crisis arrived , they died . Those who met the crisis with the truffles in their systems became Dree . But what of Arboghast , the scroot officer ? He was neither Dree in the making nor a mind-slave . But he was unquestionably psychotic , a mind absorbed completely by the Tyrant archetype . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possession by the Hero ( or Bandar 's by the Helper if he gave in to it ) , protect him from mind slavery , or even from the lassitude ? The nonaut automatically began examining the question as if he might begin drafting a paper . Then it struck him that , if the Dree were truly resurgent on an Old Earth that no longer possessed substantial military forces , there would be no one to publish his thoughts , nor any to read them . The Bureau volante slid down toward the south end of Victor , passed over Rovertown , and alighted on the open promenade deck of the Oiguloa . A forward hatch gaped , guarded by two Rovers with pulse rifles . Arboghast summoned them to haul Harkless 's still unconscious body from the vehicle . The guards responded immediately , and Bandar deduced that the psychotic scroot must be a willing ally of the Dree . The relationship was not too far-fetched . Typically , all the Tyrant ever wanted was to stand atop a heap of humanity . The greater the heap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nonhuman Dree would be just another natural force to be worked with to produce the desired end . The renegade gestured for Bandar to precede them as the Rovers dragged the inert young agent to the hatch . Below the deck began a stairway guarded by two more armed Rovers . Bandar was directed downward to a great open space , one of the landship 's cargo holds , where a number of people sat or lay upon the floor . Some wore the uniforms of the Oigulon 's crew , others were in sleeping attire and must have been brought here from their homes in Victor . The guards laid Harkless on his back on a pile of rough sacking on the floor of the hold . Bandar sat beside the young man and examined him , finding his breathing regular and his pulse steady and strong . Physically , the agent was fine , although too strong a dose from a shocker could permanently disrupt neural processes essential to personality and memory . A man sitting nearby rose and came to take a look at the unconscious young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nonaut looked up , thought the man 's face was familiar , then realized that he had been seeing that saintly visage regularly projected to the passengers on the cruise : Father Olwyn , more commonly known as Horslan Cebbling , fraudster . " How is he ? " the man said . Harkless 's eyes fluttered and opened . " We 'll know in a moment , " Bandar said . " He 'll be fine , " said another voice , and Bandar turned to see that Raina Haj was seated not far away , a grim look in her eyes and a dark bruise on her jaw . " Arboghast was eager to take him alive and aware . It seems they have a history . " The young man was swimming back up into consciousness now . " He 's coming to , " Gebbling said . " That futterer did n't turn his brain to jelly . " Grunting with pain , Harkless sat up and his hands went first to his bandaged leg . Then he looked about him , registering faces before asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his partner was still up on the Monument . The nonaut watched the young man 's eyes as he delivered the news and was sure he saw no evidence there of the Hero . That was not unexpected shockers grievously overstimulated the body 's own electrochemistry , generating a powerful internal surge of electrical current that had the same mind-clearing effect as a shock delivered from an external source . But now , after all his efforts to deliver the young man from the archetype 's grasp , Bandar was coming to believe that a Hero was precisely what the situation called for . " Imbry will die out there , " the young man was saying . " We will all die , in one manner or another , " Bandar said . Nothing summoned a Hero like an expression of despair , and the nonaut looked to see if the provocative comment had raised a glimmer behind the agent 's eyes , but saw nothing . " And Kosmir ? " the scroot said . Bandar described the gory end of the prisoner and again sought for the Hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harkless 's voice was a croak . He asked for water . Bandar had seen people dipping from a barrel not far away . He pointed it out to the young man , leaving him to rise and get his own drink . Fain could help bring up the Hero . Before Harkless took his first limping step toward the barrel , the nonaut warned him that the Rover guards would shoot without warning . An imminent threat can also summon the Hero , he thought . But when Harkless came to sit with them again , his face remained his own . He watched as two Rovers descended the steps from the deck above , carrying between them a man in a landship uniform whose legs would not support him . They laid the crewman moaning on the deck . The young agent watched as the Rovers chose a plump female in the attire of a steward and led her away . He stared at the armed guards at the top of the stairs . " Those are not hunting weapons , " he said . " They are pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery " that the Orgulon delivered , " Gebbling said . He had also seen heavy weapons and some kind of armor that would convert the gig and Arboghast 's volante into fighting vehicles . " Where do they take the people ? " Harkless asked . " To be tested , " Gebbling said . " Only the ones who fail are returned here . Most pass the test and are consigned to the crches . " " Test ? Crches ? " Harkless 's face hardened and Bandar saw the first spark of the archetype in his eyes . He fanned it into flame , offering a lurid account of how the Dree transformed their captives into copies of themselves . The threat of losing a sense of identity could always outrage a pure archetype . He watched as the madness rose steadily in the young scroot . Eventually the power of the psychosis would overcome the residual effects of the shocker , and Harkless would become a potent weapon to use against their captors - determined , superbly coordinated in the arts of violence , and completely ruthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminous glow to the young man 's face . Its youthful features now looked as if carved from old wood . " So some become Dree , " Harkless said , " and the rest are slaves ? " " Except for the tiny few who go mad , " Bandar told him . " I would rather die fighting the guards , " the Hero said . The transition had been made . The conversation turned to Arboghast and how , as the scroot pursued Gebbling into a played-out brillion mine that the fraudster was salting with high-grade ore samples , they had both encountered the Dree entity imprisoned within a gravitational cyst . The Dree had easily enslaved Gebbling , but Arboghast 's psychosis had armored his mind against its power . Instead , they had struck a bargain to spread the lassitude and create a new Dree hive . The forgotten enemy would secretly burrow beneath the population centers of Old Earth , capturing humans and converting them into legions of hive-mates , until they burst onto a defenseless world . Having sketched this dark vision of despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hero : a small ray of hope . He speculated that the only missing step between the Dree and its victory was that the Dree archetype had not yet been able to create enough actual Dree for the hive mind to coalesce . Harkless had been staring at his feet . His head jerked up and he looked sharply at the nonaut . " It has not coalesced ? " Bandar recalled the feral manner in which the new-made Dree had savaged Kosmir . He said he believed that there was probably a need for a critical mass of Dree brains before their behavior rose above the instinctual and a unified consciousness emerged . Bandar could see the Hero was strong in Harkless , though the young agent 's body remained weak from the effect of the shocker . Still , he would soon be fully restored . The nonaut looked around the cargo hold , counting guards and noting their dispositions . Not too long and the moment would be right for the Helper to outline a desperate plan that the Hero would soon come to think of as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting with his knees drawn up , absently rubbing the spot on his calf where the Dree had punctured the muscle , Bandar felt a pang of misgiving . The young scroot would almost certainly die in the coming violence , and Bandar would be complicit in his death . Yet , if nothing is done , Bandar thought , we will all die , one way or another : transmogrified into Dree , worked to death by Dree , or excruciatingly tormented to death for the delectation of Dree . Besides , to die for the good of all is what the Hero Sacrificial is for . But somehow the voice did not sound like his own . Bandar wondered how much he , himself , was under the spell of the Helper archetype . Or is that what I am /or ? he wondered . But he put aside these qualms and concentrated on the elements of the immediate situation , while keeping a close eye on the Hero . The pair of Rovers who had taken away the plump steward now came back without her . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fungus beds , Raina Ha ) said . Bandar saw the Hero 's resolve deepen further . " When they are taken , how are they tested ? " the young man said , and the noonaut could hear a deeper note in his voice . Gebbling explained that each captive was brought near to the gravitational anomaly where the Dree entity was encapsulated . In moments its mental powers ransacked the mind and decided the prisoner 's fate . " I will fight its power , " said the Hero . Soon , Bandar thought . Very soon . He watched as the Rovers reached the bottom of the stairs . The ones who came for the testees carried no weapons that could be seized . But if a strong , highly coordinated Hero were to attack them , they might be battered unconscious - Rovers had thin skulls - then that powerful Hero might pick up one of their inert forms and , using him as a shield against the pulse rifles , rush up the stairs and disarm one of the guards before they could seal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the balance of power in the confined space would soon shift in his favor . Bandar looked at the young man , saw residual tremors in his legs and arms . Very well , he thought . A little while longer for him to recover . Then we 'll see . But the pair of Rovers did not take one of the landship 's crew . Their strong fingers , set with thick , dark nails , closed upon the still trembling arms of Baro Harkless . They pulled him to his feet and hauled him to the stairs . The Hero struggled , but the strength was not there . In a few moments , Harkless was dragged protesting through the hatch . And the Helper was left helpless . GUTH BANDAR MADE his way to where the great white Wall loomed . He approached it , searching with the corners of his eyes until he found the discoloration that marked where the Dree had broken through eons before . It tended to slip from the gaze when he looked at it directly so he employed an Institute mentalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he raised a hand and touched a finger to the faint mark . It was solid , no different from any other stretch of the Wall . Bandar lowered his hand and considered what he had learned . The Dree of old had broken through into the human Commons , just as humans on Camza had broken into the Bololo nosphere . Yet the surviving Dree entity had not done so this time . Or at least , not yet . Bandar could only assume that the entity itself , though it had the strength to enslave individual humans and even to break into the Rover Commons and seize them all , was not yet powerful enough to smash its way through the Wall . On Gamza , it had taken a mass of humans concentrating on the same archetypical material to make the Bololos cavort and dance . It must require a critical mass of Dree , unified into a hive-mind , to crash through the Wall . But soon that hive-mind would cohere , and when it did , the Dree would spread with the same virulence that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole worlds down The Spray . How this information could help , however , was an answer that eluded him . He was convinced that the situation was now beyond hope . The Rovers had taken away the Hero . Bandar presumed that Arboghast , at his leisure , had had the young scroot brought before him and had simply killed him , probably painfully and with maximum humiliation . It was what Tyrants invariably did with failed Heroes . Not long after , the Rovers had come for Bandar . They had taken him from the landship , walked him to a nearby mine entrance , then down a series of interconnecting tunnels until a strong gravitational anomaly had pulled him to his knees . He felt the Dree archetype touch his mind , and sought to defend himself with the three , three , seven thran . But the tones meant nothing to the alien entity . He felt it winnow the contents of his psyche with cold precision , brushing aside his individuality and disdaining the Institute mentalisms he tried to summon against it . He might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a moment it was over . The Dree did not tell him what fate had been assigned to him , but the Rovers soon made it clear by their actions . He was taken to a deeper part of the mine where row upon row of coffin-sized holes had been bored into the rock . Here he was handed over to humans from Victor , dull-eyed mind slaves in the garb of miners , who efficiently swaddled Bandar from head to toe in a shroud of semi transparent material that tightly bound his limbs to his body . One of them tore a hole in the stuff where it covered the nonaut 's nose and mouth , allowing him to take a relieved breath , but the relief was shortlived : two of them tilted him back on his heels , then lifted him and shoved him feet-first into a waisthigh hole . A moment later , calloused fingers pressed against his teeth , forced his mouth open so that a feeding tube could be inserted roughly into his gullet . Almost immediately , he felt a pulse of coldness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Swept , he thought , to speed the transformation . Now Bandar 's body lay in its crypt-like crche , alien fungus insinuating its substance into his tissues , while his consciousness wandered the Commons seeking a last desperate hope . But there was nothing he could do at the Wall and he turned away . As he did so , his eye noticed on the ground the long pale scar he had seen before . He remembered what Harkless has said about swimming through the Old Sea to the Rover Commons , how he had freed the dreaming Yaffak . But Bandar had no means to cut through the floor of the Commons . He deployed his globular map and looked for a route to a Location where magical weapons were an important element of the dynamic . Might as well get the best , he thought . Then he dismissed the notion . He knew all too well what happened to nonauts who entered the Old Sea : they lost all volition , hanging helpless and inert in the pearly waters until the great Worm came like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him , a true despair , for there was nothing he could do . This was work for a Hero , but even the Hero had been murdered before it could lift its sword . A spot in the globe was blinking , yellow alternating with red . The map remembered the last Location its owner had been . It was reminding Bandar of his recent visit with Harkless to the Event that memorialized the hemming of the Dree . There was a quick route to it from where he now stood at the Wall , and Bandar made his way there . Perhaps whatever coincidence had brought him and the young scroot there would give Bandar an idea . If not , he could pass from the Event to one of the nicer Class One Heavens , walk without a thran , and let himself be absorbed into paradise - before the Dree robbed him of his essence . He arrived in the Location when it was reaching just about the same point in its cycle as when he had left it . The armored assault had passed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars . Singing the insulating thran , Bandar went down onto the plain and sought the ditch where the Dree weapons crew had died . It was to this spot that the Commons had called Harkless . Perhaps there was something here that would make itself known to Bandar , now that he knew what the young man 's strangeness had been all about . But when he bent , chanting , over the charred Dree corpses , he found no revelation . He pulled at the carbonized chitin , looking for some object that would provide a clue . But there was nothing . Something hard and cold touched his shoulder . Bandar leapt up , an unintentional shriek taking the place of the thran . He landed crookedly and fell back upon the dead Dree . Above him , against the splash of stars and near-space orbitale , limned by green and orange flashes of weapons fire in the hills above the plain , he saw the outline of a man wearing a winged helmet . The cold , hard thing that had touched his shoulder was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanting in Baro Harkless 's voice the thran that hid them from the battle . " What are you doing ? " Bandar said . The Hero gestured at him and Bandar realized he must take over the thran while the other answered : " I have come for you . You are the Helper . " " There is nothing to be done . I am sealed in a crche being transmogrified into a Dree . They are all taken : Cebbling , Ha ) , the last of the landship crew . It is too late . " " Yet here you are prodding the Dree dead . " " I had a faint hope there would be something here that would serve us , " Bandar said . " I found nothing . " By the light of an explosion out on the plain he saw the expression on the Hero 's face : assured , almost amused . Typical , he thought . Harkless was suggesting they go somewhere where they could talk without having to switch the thran back and forth . Bandar consulted his map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went through into an Earnest/Realistic blizzard . Two steps in the direction his noonaut sense provided and he opened another gate that admitted them to the searing heat of a desert . The sun above them was yellow , almost white , an early rendering . Sweat sprouted all over Bandar 's body . Harkless , though in mail armor and animal pelt , showed no sign of discomfort . Indeed , he wore that characteristic look of excited anticipation that was so essentially the Hero 's . And yet there was something else there . It was impossible for a psychotic to be possessed by two archetypes - they would inevitably clash - yet there was a complexity to the Hero 's aspect that Bandar could n't account for . He even believed he still saw remnants of the strange young man . " I thought you 'd be dead , " he said . " Arboghast taunted me , then sent me to be made into a Dree , " the other said , and it seemed to be Harkless who was speaking . " Now I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led them to a slope of sand ornamented by wind-scoured bones . " You said you had an idea ? " he said . " Out on the Swept , I entered the Rover Commons and freed Yaffak from his bonds , " Harkless said . " I have come to accept that , " Bandar said . " I have even seen the scar in the floor beside the Wall . " " I believe I could return by the same route and free the others . I would enter their dreams , cut the tethers , one by one . They would turn on the Dree and slaughter them before the hive mind consolidates . They could then free those who have been placed in the creches , including you and me . " It did not seem practical to Bandar . He pointed out that when Yaffak had been freed the Rover had been physically far from where the Dree entity lay imprisoned in its gravitational anomaly . Here , the bonds were surely stronger . " And what of the Rovers that are not asleep and dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reaction . This late in its dynamic , a fully engaged Hero would show impatience , even anger , at any attempt by the Helper to divert it from the catharsis . But the figure in front of him maintained a cheerful equanimity . " I hoped you would show more enthusiasm , " the Hero said . " It seems a good plan to me . I got it from the Wise Man , after all . " " The Wise Man ? " Bandar said , carefully keeping an even tone . " Yes . The one with the long white beard and the staff . " " And where did you encounter him ? " " At the Wall . Now he speaks within me . " The Hero 's face turned uncharacteristically thoughtful , and Bandar was fairly sure he was hearing Baro Harkless . The shifting of faces and voices reminded him of something , but when he sought for it , it faded away . Harkless was saying , " It works best if I do n't try to get a direct answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , really ? " Bandar said . " And have you heard from any others ? " Harkless pulled at his chin . " The Father , I think . He does n't speak directly to me , but I sense that he takes an interest . The others just watch . " Bandar rested his forehead on his spread fingertips and addressed the Sincere/Approximate grains of sand on the slope before him . " You have come into close contact with several pure characteristic entities ? " " All of them , I believe . Though some kept their distance . " " And none of them absorbed you ? " " I think the Hero has taken an interest . " Bandar lifted his head and looked at the leather-belted leggings , the helmet and the shaggy paw-crossed pelt . " Taken an interest , " he said , as if talking to himself . " Hmm , " said Harkless . " That 's how it seems . " Bandar stared out across the lone and level sands . " All of this is , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Anyone approached by a characteristic entity is absorbed . The archetypical energy is immense , overpowering-a great wind encountering a tiny flame . Poof ! And that is that . " " I have not found it so , " said Harkless . " Perhaps it has something to do with the presence of the Dree entity , right next door , so to speak . " " Well , of course it has something to do with the Dree ! " Bandar snapped . " It has everything to do with the Dree ! But that 's not an explanation for the impossible . " " Nonetheless , the Wise Man is very confident . " " Archetypes , " Bandar said , " are always sure of their plans . That is why it is dangerous to listen solely to one of them . Even two can be mutually reinforcing in their madness . A prudent fellow samples a wide range of opinions and creates a consensus . " " A prudent fellow would not end up wrapped snugly in a hole in a rock wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see your point , " Bandar said . " My point is that even if the Hero and the Wise Man are wrong , their plan is at least an attempt to resist . And even if its chances of success are minimal , they are still greater than if we lie passive in our crches waiting to be extinguished . " Bandar looked off into the heat haze . " I had formed my own plan . The Dree may inherit my empty shell . I will have fled to Paradise . " He saw a wistful look appear on the young man 's face , but it was almost immediately supplanted by the Hero . " I would rather die doing all that I could to defeat the enemy . " " I believe it to be a lost cause , " Bandar said . The Hero Sacrificial solidified in Harkless 's eyes . " That is the best kind of cause , " he said . Bandar made it clear that he was not convinced , then grew concerned at the flash of anger that he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword 's length was an uncomfortable companion , even for a Helper . He decided to evoke the Wise Man . " Perhaps the one with the long beard could convince me , " he said . He saw the shift take place behind the young man 's eyes . A cool and level gaze now looked back at him . The voice that came out of Harkless 's mouth had a different timbre . " I know what will move you . " " Indeed ? What would that be ? " The hand that did not hold a sword gestured to the emptiness around them and the eyes twinkled . " What ? The desert ? " Bandar said . " The Commons . " Well played , thought Bandar , though he said nothing . The Wise Man said , " You have devoted your life to the nosphere . Though there be only the slightest hope of saving this great and ancient work of humanity , would you not clutch at that hope even over the certainty of Paradise ? " Bandar sighed and rose to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route back to the Wall . He swore softly under his breath then chanted the thran that opened a gate . The scar in the ground had faded to a faint scratch . The Hero had dimmed a little in Harkless 's face and Bandar saw a trace of fear . He could understand the young man 's trepidation . To swim once in the Old Sea and see the Worm coming would be hard enough . To do it twice was more than the nonaut cared to contemplate . " If we had a rope to tie around one leg , you could pull me back . It would be faster than swimming . " " But we have no rope . " " Can you not bring one from some other part of the Commons ? " Bandar was not sure that an object purloined from a Location could survive in the Old Sea . He now found himself facing a Hero 's impatience . " Why do n't we find out ? " Bandar examined his map and sang a thran . He passed into a stone chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his young queen threw smoldering glances at a muscular young bravo in tunic and sandals , then entered a wasteland of shattered brick and broken glass , where the ground trembled to a violent aftershock . He slid down a pile of masonry , opened another gate , and stepped onto the planked deck of a ship powered by serried banks of oars . The vessel was tilted sharply to one side and Bandar heard the sound of inrushing water . Another galley was backing away , its bronze beak fouled with wreckage . Around him , cursing men in figured breastplates and shining grieves struggled to strip off their armor before sliding and tumbling into the sea . From below decks came screams . Chanting a thran , Bandar traversed the slanting deck and scooped up a coiled rope . He examined it closely , finding it to be a densely fibered Earnest/Realistic type , as suited such a Class One Event as a Decisive Sea Battle . He slid the coil up his arm and over his shoulder , then made his way back , via a shortcut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wall . The Hero was still ascendant . It took the cord and knotted it around one ankle , leaving the rest coiled upon the ground . Then it rose and pressed the sword 's point into one end of the scar made by his earlier passage . The ground dimpled , then the sword went through , and the Hero 's muscles bunched as it forced the edge along the thin line and then well beyond . " I 've made a bigger gap , " it said , " since I will surely be longer freeing many than I was freeing one . Try to keep the gap open . It will immediately begin to heal over . " " I will , " Bandar said . " I am the Helper . " " Then I go . " Bandar saw that the Hero was full in Harkless as it parted the lips of the wound and made a shallow dive into the Old Sea . The slit swallowed the mail-clad body like a lipless mouth . Immediately its edges pressed themselves back together around the rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding into the incision ; the Hero was willing itself through nothingness toward the Rover Commons . True to his promise , Bandar knelt and slipped his fingers into the gash to pull it apart and keep it from healing . The effort strained his virtual muscles and he used an Institute mentalism to pour more of his being into his reified hands and arms . The gap appeared again and he found himself looking into the ancient realm of presapience . No nonaut had gazed upon the Old Sea in time out of mind . Bandar looked down into its seeming waters , suffused by a sourceless glow of pearly light , and marveled at its luminous mystery . Some early explorers had recorded a common reaction to the sight of the Unknowingness , as it was originally known : a strange yearning to sink into its depths , to be shed of the burden of self-awareness and become , as our prehuman ancestors were , one with the nothingness of pure being . Bandar stared into the endless depths and waited to see if there arose in him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided it was a quality he lacked . Being Bandar these many years has not been an unalloyed joy , he mused , but , all taken in all , I would rather have been Bandar than not have been anything . His thoughts were interrupted by a flicker of motion at the edge of his vision . He angled his head to look down through the gap at a slant . A tiny creature appeared to undulate slowly toward him . But Bandar knew that it was neither tiny nor slow , it was the great Worm , and it was coming to devour Harkless and return the Old Sea to a population of one . He watched in mingled fascination and dread as the mindless entity swam toward him . Gradually , it grew in apparent size from the length of the smallest segment on the smallest of Bandar 's fingers to the length of the entire digit . From that change , Bandar tried to estimate how long it would take the Worm to reach the gap . But he abandoned the calculation , he had no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rover Commons , find and free a dreaming Rover , then repeat the process . And , besides , time was not time in the Commons nor in the Old Sea . But even if the scheme worked , what use would be a few free Rovers against all their enslaved fellows and all the humans who were by now mind-thralls of the Dree ? Bandar sighed and looked again at the Worm . It was the size of his longest finger and growing steadily . He could make out the circular orifice that was its face , opening and closing as it swam , revealing a rim of triangular teeth , flashing white against the blackness of its maw . The rope had ceased to slide into the gap . Either Harkless had made it to the other side or he hung , helpless in the grip of the gray void , as emptied of all volition as had been its first explorers . After a moment , another length of the cord was jerked through and Bandar decided that the young man had yanked it from the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hang it coiled on the thorn hedge against his return . The Worm was closer now , appearing as long as Bandar 's hand from wrist to fingertip . Bandar looked up and away from it and was startled , then terrified , to find that he was not alone . A crowd had gathered in the seeming field that led to the Wall , forming a demilune around a narrow crescent of space at the center of which was Bandar and the gap in the Common floor . The nonaut knew them all : there stood the Magus , behind him the Thing-in-the-Dark , and over there was the Bully and the trio of Maiden , Matron , and Crone , and beyond them the seer and the Believer , and scores more , the entire throng of usual suspects from the prime arrondisement . Prominent in the center front of the crowd were the Father and the Fool , the Wise Man and the Hero and Helper . This last figure looked at Bandar , cocked its head , and winked . Trembling , Bandar rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they surrounded him on every side except the unpassable Wall . Stark fear shook him ; he fought to subdue it . But all of his training , since the day Preceptor Huffley had first led him to stand on the bridge and see the characteristic entities , had assured him that to be in the presence of a pure archetype without the protection of a thran meant certain absorption . Now it was as if he had crossed the bridge to gambol amongst them . And yet ... nothing happened . He remained Bandar , and the thran that had wanted to spring to his lips got no further than the opening of his mouth . The Wise Man made a small gesture of its gnarled hand and said , " You are in no more danger than we are . " Bandar conquered his feat . " How can this be ? " he said . The answer came suddenly , in a burst of released memory . He remembered all of it , the smith and the mute , being laughed out of the Institute , his uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Multifacet , the manipulation that had denied him everything that he had wished his life to be . He saw how they had used him , had even coerced him into reluctantly agreeing to be used . He wondered how much of his life had been bizarrely twisted , that he might fulfill this role he now played . Anger flooded him . " It had to be a nonaut , " the Wise Man said . " Did it have to be me ? Why not Didrick Gabbris ? " " It required an exceptional mind , one that could accept innovation . The Helper must be able to help . " And now they showed him more : the shape of Baro Harkless 's life , the death of the boy 's father by the conniving of Ardmander Arboghast , the years of obsession with becoming an agent of the Bureau of Scrutiny , a devotion that separated young Harkless from the ordinary run of humankind , walling him off , time and again , from the simple human experiences that ought to have been part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bandar - anger , resentment , pity , even wonder . He looked into the eyes of the Wise Man , then into those of the Hero and Helper , the Father and the others , seeing their terrible simplicity that was at once both essentially human and inhuman , just the raw , rough bricks out of which real people were built . They had shaped Baro Harkless into a kind of replica of themselves : a simplified facsimile of a human being ) an instrument ; a tool to do a job . They had shaped Guth Bandar as well , twisting and chopping the substance of his life so that he would answer . to the purpose they would put him to . Still , the Helpei could not be as simple as the Hero ; he would have a subtler part to play , so they had left Bandar enough of a life for him to realize what had been done to him . And enough to know what they intended for Baro Harkless . " You have sent him to die for you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the Hero Sacrificial-not the Conqueror , not the Reluctant Champion , not the Commoner Who Rises . There is no chance that he can free dreaming Rovers and set them on the Dree . " The Wise Man returned his angry stare with equanimity . " He will do as he must , as we did what we must . " " But he is not one of you ! He is a real human being , for all that you have edited him into a cripple ! He can no more survive in the waking world than a glove can function without a hand . " " This is about survival , " said the archetype . " We could not defeat the Dree . We could not do it the first time , we can not do it now that it returns . It is one where we are many , a fist against fingers . " " But how can Harkless defeat that thing ? " The Wise Man 's eyes showed no emotion , had none to show , Bandar realized . " He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is only one force that can . " The archetype turned its affectless eyes toward the gap in the Commons floor . Bandar understood . " The Dree entity is like the newly made Dree . If Harkless runs , it will pursue him . And you will have made sure that that stratagem will occur to him . " " It will , " said the Wise Man , " for I am part of him . " " So he will lead the Dree back to the gash in the ground on the Rovers " side , and it will follow him into the Old Sea . " " And there the Worm will take it . " " And him , " said Bandar . The Wise Man 's gaze was unperturbed . " Perhaps . " The Hero spoke . " Sometimes the one must die to save the many . " And the Father said , " I believe he will not die . " " And if he does n't , " said Bandar , " then what ? " " Then he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but live as what ? He is not fit for this world . He is like one of you , a rough draft who strides about in his simplicity , constantly colliding with the disordeiliness of real life , always bumping his nose against nuances and contradictions the rest of us easily avoid . " The archetypes regarded him without comprehension , as if he were speaking a language they did not understand . Only the Father looked troubled . There was nothing to do but wait , and hope . Bandar seated himself on the ground at the base of the slit and took the rope in his hands . The gash was still trying to close , and he put his heels to it , straining with his legs , forcing it open . He looked down and saw the Worm again , larger now , nearer . And swimming mindlessly toward the gap . A tug on the rope drew a length of it through Bandar 's hands and into the Old Sea . Bandar 's fists closed on the rough Earnest/Realistic fibers . He leapt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is coming ! " he called to the archetypes . " He has made it ! " " Unless , " said the Wise Man , " it is the Dree . Do not pull . " Bandar addressed the archetype as no nonaut had ever done , using a phrase he had scarcely ever uttered since his student days . The Wise Man 's bushy white eyebrows rose slightly , but it said nothing . Bandar saw a shadow darken the lip of the incision , then a hand appeared pulling at the rope . Baro Harkless , mailed and helmeted , his sword in its scabbard , hauled himself from the Old Sea . Not a drop of its " waters " clung to him . Harkless stood on legs that were none too steady . There was a blankness in his gaze , as if the Old Sea had leached some of the life from him . But he drew his sword and took a two-handed grip , raising it above his head , positioning himself over the closing hole . He did not notice the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of each other , and Harkless was now pure Hero . " Stand clear , " it said . " It came after me . I doubt I can kill it , but if I can stop it from coming through the gap , the Worm will take it . " Bandar backed away , giving him room to swing the weapon . " I doubt it , too , " he said . " But I would have had the same doubts about your being able to cross from one Commons to another by the Old Sea , yet twice have you done it . " " Take the rope and pull , " the Hero said . " Draw it to me . " Bandar did as he was asked , but gave the rope only the slightest tug . It came freely . He felt no weight , no Dree . Still , again he gave it only the smallest pull . " Do it again . " Bandar heard the Hero rising high , and it called up the Helper in his own being . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yank , still felt no resistance . He drew it , hand over hand , and it came freely through the incision , until the end appeared . He called to the Hero , standing with sword raised above the shrinking gap . " Can you see anything ? " " No . Perhaps the Worm has it . " Or the Old Sea has stolen its will , Bandar thought . Either way , we aie saved . Aloud , he said , " Then , right now , the Rovers are turning on your renegade scroot officer . They will hunt him and likely kill him . The miners will be rescuing the captives from the crches . " The gap in the ground was closing rapidly now . The crowd of archetypes stood silent but made no move to withdraw to their proper place . Bandar wanted to be away from them as swiftly as he could . He took out his globular map and said , " I will plot us a route to one of the Heavens . We can rest there until they come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword . The gap in the ground was now almost completely healed . Bandar saw that a node only a few steps away would take them to a benign Landscape from which there were several exits . He opened his mouth to sing the tones that would open the gate . An astonishing pain tore through the back of his right knee , followed almost instantly by a chill of frigid cold , as if a claw of ice had been thrust into his virtual flesh . Bandar looked down and saw between his legs a gash in the floor of the Commons , wider than the one Harkless had made , ripped by the weapons at the ends of the Dree 's forelimbs . Its hooked claw was sunk deep into Bandar . Now the Dree tore the rent wider , forcing its thorax through from below . It reached up and sank a second talon into Bandar 's thigh muscle and this time the nonaut screamed as it hooked itself into him to haul itself free of the Old Sea . It dug its scimitar-clawed feet into the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , then flung him at the Wall . He struck with an impact that shook his virtual body and fell to the ground , stunned . His globular map , shaken from his grip at the first stab of pain , had rolled free . He saw the Dree notice the motion , its tendrils questing , then it scooped up the object , raised it to the eyeless face , and Bandar sensed an emotion radiating from the entity , a wave of cruel satisfaction . He attempted to rise , but his torn legs would not respond . He looked toward the throng of archetypes and saw that they were all looking to the Dree . Then , as one , their eyes turned toward Harkless . The young man was thoroughly in the grip of the Hero . He shouted defiance at the invader , rushing forward and swinging the iron sword in a lateral arc that knocked the map from its grip . The Dree reared back , its thoracic orifice opening and closing to emit a sound like fire in dry tinder . Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , straight and pointed , and shot it toward Harkless 's belly in a blur of speed . The man backswung the blade , striking the claw and diverting it from his virtual flesh . But just barely , and Bandar could see that the clash of metal against chitin had sent a shock through Harkless . Still , the Hero blazed in the young man 's eyes as he shifted his weight to his back foot , then lunged with the weapon 's point against the Dree 's eyeless head . The invader batted the thrust away with an ease that bespoke contempt . Harkless spoke aloud , in his own voice . " How do I defeat this ? " Bandar thought he was being asked , but then he realized that the answer had come from within Harkless 's being , where the Hero and the Fool and the Wise Man had made spaces for themselves . A shifting array of emotions crossed the man 's face and Bandar knew that Harkless was seeing the shape of his life , the forces that had molded him to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and Harkless said , " So I am not the Hero . Rather , I am the Fool . " He stood , listening to an answer that only he could hear , then said , " Why have you brought me to my destruction ? " The Dree had cocked its head and was regarding him . Bandar wondered if it eavesdropped on whatever conversation was going on between Harkless and the Multifacet . The nonaut had no doubt that all of the archetypes had cohered again for this moment , though to his eyes they remained a crowd . They 're not talking to me this time , he thought . I 've played my part . The Dree was growing larger , was now half again the size it had been when it came through the floor of the nosphere . There must be enough new Dree for the hive mind to emerge , Bandar thought . We are defeated . Harkless seemed lost in thought , but Bandar could imagine the colloquy that was going on between him and the Multifacet . The chosen one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Dree entity shook itself . Its digits clicked into curved claws and it moved toward Harkless . " It will kill me , " Harkless said . He looked at the sword that had done no harm to the enemy , but there was no fear in his face . The Hero had him now . Again , the nonaut struggled to rise . He knew it was because the Helper was reaching into him , willing him to aid the Hero in this last sacrifice . But he did not resist . The Dree came at Harkless , jabbing a claw at his face . He warded it off with the sword , but Bandar saw again that contact with the thing 's icy power sent a shock though him . The arm that held the sword drooped , the weapon perilously loose in his failing grip . " I can not kill it , " he said . Bandar saw him receive the message , knew that the voice in Harkless 's mind was telling him that this had never been about his killing the Dree - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about choosing . " It is about sacrifice , " Harkless said . " And willingness . " The Dree was fashioning a thrusting claw again , a poniard to pierce the Hero 's chest . Harkless watched it , but his attention was focused within . Bandar saw him make the decision , offer the final acceptance . " So it appears I am to be the Hero , " Harkless said . " Just not the kind of Hero I thought I was . " He turned his eyes for a moment to Bandar . " Look after my Helper , " he said . " He did not ask for this . " He said something else , but Bandar could not hear it over the clicking of the Dree 's claws against the ground as it set itself and sprang . But the Hero did not raise his sword . Instead , Harkless thrust out his chest and stepped forward . The Dree 's claw tore into his side to lance up and inward . Bandar saw pain blossom in the young man 's face , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill . For a moment he saw despair . Then , with a shout , Harkless clamped his free arm around the Dree 's neck , lifting his feet from the ground so that his full weight hung from its upper body . Now he wrapped his legs around it and the Dree was forced to bend toward the ground . Harkless swung with his sword hand , slashing again and again at the earth where the Dree had broken through . The light of the Old Sea glowed on the iron blade . The Dree reacted , attempting to straighten . One forelimb was stuck in Harkless 's virtual flesh , but it reached now to sink the other 's claw into his back and rip him free . It gave off a rank odor that Bandar realized was the reek of fear . Bandar saw the shape of the plan , and knew that the Helper must help . His legs still would not function but he dragged himself forward until he was beneath the Dree 's feet . He sank his hands into the gap that the Hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up and saw the tip of the thing 's claw touch Harkless 's spine but at that moment the sword that had torn the ground sliced into the lowermost joint of one of the Dree 's hind legs . The chitin was thinnest there . The green armor parted , spilling a yellow ichor , and the Dree emitted a hiss . Its stench became overpowering . Harkless cut again , into the other leg . The Dree twisted , trying to throw him clear , but he held on . The thing 's legs buckled and it pitched forward . Together , invader and Hero tumbled through the rent in the ground and into the Old Sea . Bandar saw them sink . But the endless eerie gray luminescence of the realm below no longer dominated his view : instead , he saw the mindless Worm , its great lightless circle of a mouth as vast as a dark planet . Harkless and the Dree , the Hero still embracing the monster , were falling into the blackness that rose to engulf them . Then the Dree gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claw free of Harkless 's body . It kicked its hind legs and pushed with its forelimbs against the substance of the Old Sea , struggling to rise again to the gap where Bandar watched . But as it pulled free of Harkless , the young man reached up after it . He grasped its legs . The cruel spikes that protruded from its limbs pierced his palms , but he held on , and Bandar saw the immense will in him not to let the creature win free and return to the Commons . Then the Worm took them both . Bandar watched them sink into its cavernous mouth , the Dree still struggling to pull free of Harkless 's grasp . The huge triangular teeth closed upon the Dree where abdomen met thorax and sliced it into two pieces . The mouth opened again to let the dead thing fall into its maw . Bandar saw Harkless free his hands of the creature 's remnants then , its task completed , he saw the Hero leave the young man 's face . Now there was only Baro Harkless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled with apprehension . " No ! " The cry came from somewhere deep in Bandar . He looked up at the crowd of archetypes . Their faces were filling again with the monomanias that formed their intrinsic natures . They were drifting away . One of them - the Healer , he realized - had paused near him . The figure absently waved a hand and at once the pain in Bandar 's legs was gone . " That is not enough ! " Bandar rose to his knees and called to the Wise Man who , with the Father , the Fool and the Hero and his Helper , were among the last to turn away . The graybeard turned toward him and for a moment Bandar quailed at what he saw in those wrinkle-framed eyes , but he rallied and said , " It is not right to leave him there ! Not after he did all that you required of him ! " " It was what he was for , " said the Wise Man . " Now it is done . " " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Yet the other three hesitated . But there was no time to argue and convince . Bandar seized the rope , and tossed one end of it to the Helper , saying , " You 're the Helper . So help . " Then he tied the other end to his ankle , and without looking to see what the archetype had done , and before his fear could stop him , he dove through the gap and went down into the Old Sea . And into the mouth of the Worm . It had risen almost to the roof of its world and now was sinking back down , its huge mouth still open but beginning to close . Bandar plunged straight into the darkness , then began to stroke with his arms like a diver in a pool . He passed the pieces of the Dree , saw that they were already half dissolved , then kept his eyes fixed on the grayish outline of Baro Haikless far down in the dimness of the Worm 's gullet . The light was fading as the Worm 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help ; indeed , he was surprised he could move at all . It is an expression of will , he concluded . I do not accept this outcome and will make it different . It occurred to him that he had the seeds of a seminal paper for the Institute . Then he countered that thought with the consideration that his chances of preparing and presenting any paper , ever again , were highly dubious . Harkless was closer now . Bandar could make out the young man 's face . The Hero had left him . Instead , Bandar saw behind the young man 's features the face of Baro as a young boy , full of innocence and simplicity . Then the man sank farther into the darkness . Bandar dug with his hands and arms against the substance of what was supposed to be nothingness . Within the Worm , there is more than the void of the Old Sea , he thought , feeling something resisting his motions and thus letting them propel himself deeper . There 's another great paper , he thought . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms smacked into something solid . A moment later , two strong hands seized his wrists . I have him ! he thought . Now , does anyone have me . Then the rope jerked his ankle and together they rose toward the rent in the floor of the nosphere . The Worm was assisting by sinking back into the Old Sea . But when Bandar looked over his shoulder he saw the huge wedges of its teeth approaching each other , like gears about to mesh . He closed his eyes and willed that he and Harkless should rise faster , then opened them to see the serrated edge of one great pale triangle pass by him with barely a handsbreadth to spare . Then he was out of the mouth , with Harkless coming after him . Bandar gripped the animal pelt that the young man still wore and yanked Harkless toward him , pulling him free of the mouth just as the teeth came together . Moments later they were hauled through the rip and back into the Commons . The red lips of the gash closed rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm fleshy floor of the nosphere . Then the nonaut rolled over and sat up to untie the rope from his ankle . Not far away he saw the Father , the Fool , the Hero , and the Helper , lined up one behind the next , the cord still in their hands . They regarded him with understanding , but already he could see the blankness creeping back into their eyes . He threw off the rope and shook Harkless . The young man turned to him a face that was still suffused with the acceptance of his own death . Bandar shook him again and said , " We must depart . They are reverting to their true natures . " The nonaut sang the three , three , and seven thran and was gratified to hear Harkless chime in . The archetypes lost their perception of them and turned away , letting fall the rope . Last to go was the Helper , who cast a look back over his shoulder in the direction of Bandar and dropped one eyelid . Bandar shuddered . Then he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He used a mentalism to summon it back to his hand then sang open a gate . But Harkless held back , gesturing to the departing archetypes . Now that the Hero was fled from him , he could see them . " How did you get them to aid you ? " he said . " I called on them and they helped . " " Were you not afraid one of them would absorb you ? " " They were not here for me , " Bandar said . " They were here for you . " They passed through a series of Locations until they came back to the Landscape of the Prairie . Bandar had not been back here since the episode with the pigs . He was glad to see that no trace of those events remained . He led Harkless over a roll of ground that sheltered them from the constant wind and they sat together . " We should go back to our bodies , " the young man said . " I will arrest Ardmander Arboghast , if he lives . " Bandar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hero I hear ? " But the eyes that looked back at him held none of the archetype 's elementary madness . " No , " Harkless said , " all that died in the Worm . You are hearing a man who wishes to bring to justice the killer of his father . " " We will not lose much time here , " Bandar said . " And first I have to tell you a story . " " I have had enough of stories . I wonder if I have had only stories , all these years , and never a real life . " " That is what this story is about , " the nonaut said . " It began a long , long time ago , when I was a student ... " BANDAR REENTERED waking life to find that he was in a ward of the Victor infirmary and that Baro Harkless was engaged in an argument with Raina Haj . The young agent had risen from his bed and was determined to go after Arboghast , who had escaped when the Rovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must remain in Victor to testify at a Bureau of Scrutiny inquiry that was soon to convene . A bandaged Luff Imbry , rescued from the Monument , reposed on one of the beds , eating fruit and taking his partner 's side . The argument had reached the point where Harkless had resigned from the scroots and Ha ) had drawn her shocker to prevent his leaving . Now Bandar intervened . " Let me offer a proposal , " he said . Not long after , he and Harkless stood on the road that led into the Commons , watching the motes of light that were dreamers flitting past them . Bandar was gratified to see that the young man now manifested in his own guise , without the trappings of a dawn-time Hero . " So you will not be a scroot , " Bandar said . " What will you do ? " " Study under you and become a nonaut , " the young man said . Bandar had been considering the same prospect . In some way his life was still bound to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed the connection . The young man remained almost as dangerously simple as an archetype , and when seized by determination he was no less terrifying than he had been when they had stood on the bridge overlooking the prime arrondisement . At the same time , Harkless had opened doors that led to great shining territories of new research . I am a trained nonaut with an unparalleled experience of the Commons , he told himself . He is a young man with unheard of abilities . I could spend years just delineating his capacities . It is not unthinkable that the two of us could found a new Institute that would soon rival .... He realized that Harkless was expecting an answer . " We may be able to work something out , " Bandar told him . The young man started to speak but then something caught his attention and he pointed back down the road . " He is here , " he said . Bandar approached the mote of light Harkless was following with his finger . He exerted a mentalism while chanting a complicated thran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snatched from his dream , puzzlement vying in his face with fear . Bandar had the young man lay tight hold of the renegade scroot , while he employed the technique that drew more of the prisoner 's being into the Commons , leaving only enough of him in the waking world to sustain minimal existence . It was a tense struggle - the Tyrant was strong in Arboghast - but Harkless 's will was also unnaturally powerful and the issue was soon decided . Bandar led them to a nearby gate . They stepped through into a Heaven that was familiar to the nonaut . He wondered if its cycle had renewed itself since last he was here , or whether one Principal was still laughing over the look of surprise on the Other 's face . Bandar sang the insulating thran loudly so that Harkless could conduct a conversation with his prisoner . He did not hear what was said , but gathered from Arboghast 's increasing look of terror and dismay that the discussion was not going well from the Tyrant 's point of view . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harkless 's adamantine grasp , then descended a short slope that ended at the Abyss . Bandar , still singing , looked down and saw the great flat-topped tower just below and to one side , with black-armored demons swarming up ladders to battle a formation of angelic defenders . He motioned to Harkless to move along the edge away from the assault point and they came to a quiet sector . The only movement was that of a giant leatherwinged demon , wheeling and gliding back and forth below them in intersecting double loops . Harkless said something to Arboghast and now the Tyrant struggled in earnest . But the dynamic of this moment had been established long ago . The young man flung his father 's killer out into the emptiness . The demon saw the plummeting man and indolently flapped its wings to bring itself under his descent . It caught Arboghast with talons that pierced his virtual flesh then turned and dropped toward the smoking black pit below . Bandar heard its captive 's screams dwindle to the faintest whine . Harkless stood and watched until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on his shoulder . The man turned and Bandar saw on the young face an expression that had no name . " Now what do I do ? " he said . " Wait here , " Bandar said . " You may play with the three maidens if you wish , but you should know that they are not equipped for anything but the most innocent of sport . " The blonde , brunette , and redhead were splashing in the shallow surf , casting coquettish glances their way . Harkless stared at them in a manner that caused Bandar to think that his companion was as inexperienced as the three idiomats . " Are you leaving me here ? " Harkless asked . " Only for a short time . " Bandar approached the Sincere/Approximate jungle beneath the palm trees that fringed the tropical beach . He used his Institute-trained memory to lead him to a spot , then stopped . He was reasonably sure that he had come the correct distance in the right direction . Now he exercised the nonaut 's sense that could detect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his left side . He turned that way , inching forward until the sensation became so strong as to be unmistakable . He opened his mouth and sang the most common gate-opening thran . No fissure appeared in the air , nor did he feel the quality that nonauts called " resonancy . " He chanted the next most common sequence of tones and again nothing happened . He continued to work his way down the thran ladder , chanting more than two score sequences , before he established that none of the gate-openers worked . But two of them had returned a resonancy : the five , eight , and two had produced a weak response , while the five , four , and six had won him a strong return . From there it was a matter of trying all the possible combinations , which would have been a mathematically immense number except that Bandar was guided by the resonancy that increased the closer he came to the right sequence . In less than an hour , he chanted five ascending tones , followed by three descenders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The air rippled . Bandar paused a moment to mark the occasion . For the first time in millennia upon millennia , an explorer of the Commons had found a new gate . To demonstrate this achievement to the scholars of the Institute for Historical Inquiry would be like ... but his mind could not achieve an appropriate equivalent . He put the thought aside and stepped through . He found no mist , and had n't expected to . The fog that had shrouded the Multifacet would have been merely for effect . He stood in a lighted space that seemed to have no limit , though there would be walls somewhere , probably of the same colorless substance as the floor beneath Bandar 's feet . The place was neither hot nor cold , but warm enough for comfort , the light neither too bright nor too dim . The air was wholesome but carried no draft or breeze . Bandar deployed his globular map . And now we 'll see , he thought . He directed at the display the mentalism that would cause his present Location to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into being within the matrix of lines and colored shapes : a white circle , connected only to the beach where the three nymphets frolicked . Bandar put away the globe and surveyed the emptiness around him . This place had no dynamic . Nothing he did here could cause disharmony . He decided to try an experiment . He removed a garment and laid it on the floor , one finger still touching it to retain a connection . Then he concentrated and exerted a mentalism , holding in his mind an image of the redcushioned , ornately carved seat of black wood on which the First Overdean sat during formal dinners in the Institute 's refectory . After a moment , the air before him wavered , the garment faded and the chair appeared . Bandar sat upon it , finding it less comfortable than he had expected . It will take time to build it all , he told himself , then came another thought : unless Harkless 's exceptional talents extend in that direction too . He reopened the gate and returned to the beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the redhead a piggyback ride while the blonde and brunette chased them both . They were all laughing . " Baro ! " Bandar called . " Come away . I want to show you something . " The young man let the girl slide from his back . " I 'll be right back , " he said when she pouted . He followed Bandar off the beach and into the jungle . Bandar called up the node and they passed through . " You wanted to show me a chair ? " Harkless said . " No , " said Bandar , " I wanted to show you the Bandar-Harkless Institute for Noospheric Innovation . " " Where is it ? " " Well , " Bandar said , " I 'd like you to sit in the chair . Now close your eyes and think about a very large , well-appointed building , with spacious rooms , quiet cloisters , a good library . Oh , and an excellent wine cellar . " Harkless sat and closed his eyes . " All right , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bandar looked about him . " Oh , my , " he said .
