<p> This spring , Bay Area homeowners are likely to know whether the housing market has merely paused before resuming its upward climb or has truly downshifted to the slow lane and , if so , how dramatically . <p> Last month , the number of homes sold declined for the 10th month in a row and hit its lowest level since 2001 , and price gains slowed markedly as well . <p> Now , the question is , will the market simply cool or will it dive into negative territory ? <p> Each housing cycle in the past has had its own set of twists and turns in which a multitude of factors comes in to play . <p> As the current housing frenzy exhausts itself , variables ranging from interest rates and employment growth to affordability , new home supply and sellers ' willingness to part with their No. 1 asset will help determine the swiftness and magnitude of any downshift . <p> " Making this cycle more unique ... is that there 's been a big increase in homeownership since the early 1990s , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Economy.com . " We 've brought a lot more people into the market , and it 's uncertain how these people will react in a down cycle . " <p> The Bay Area real estate market typically runs in cycles , forming almost a stair-step pattern of multiyear price increases followed by periods of stagnation or even mild declines . <p> So far , 2006 is off to a slow start , with fewer houses and condos changing hands than in the past five years . But , historically , January and February do n't offer strong data for predicting trends . By spring and summer  --  typically the strongest buying seasons  --  it should be clear whether this winter 's pronounced sales slowdown is here to stay or not and whether it will spread to prices . <p> At the end of the last two major housing booms in the early 1980s and 1990s , prices in most areas did not collapse . <p> Even amid job losses , soaring interest rates and worsening affordability , the region 's huge price gains of the late 1970s were followed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward trajectory . <p> The next cycle saw a more striking correction . The median Bay Area home price crested at $225,000 in January 1990 , then dipped as low as $205,000  --  almost 9 percent  --  before climbing to $229,000 in the middle of May 1996 , according to DataQuick , which releases a monthly report based on county recorder data on new sales . The drop was steeper when adjusted for inflation over the years of the downturn . <p> " On the coasts , you see price run-ups , and then instead of having large price declines , you have mild declines and flattening for a period  --  it 's what you 'd call a stylized fact of the industry , " said Andrew Leventis , economist at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , the overseer of mortgage titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . <p> The question is : " Where are we in the cycle ? " It 's not entirely clear , but most observers think we are closer to the end of a booming cycle than the beginning . <p> Jobs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the aerospace industry defense industry , employers jettisoned nearly three-quarters of a million jobs within just a few years , sparking a rash of foreclosures and a nearly 30 percent plunge in home prices . <p> Yet Bay Area real estate weathered the dot-com meltdown  --  this region 's version of the aerospace industry bust  --  remarkably well , considering the area lost about 450,000 jobs in three years . <p> According to research by the federal government , price appreciation for most of the region dropped from above 20 percent in 2000 to between 5 and 10 percent in 2002 and 2003 . The only metropolitan area to dip into negative territory was Santa Clara County , where prices fell by several percentage points in 2001 and 2002 . <p> Though job levels have not returned to their lofty Nasdaq-era heights , the region is expected to add 40,000 new jobs this year and 55,000 in 2007 , suggesting that the economy , though not raging , appears to be on solid footing . <p> " Nothing leads to big declines in house prices except job destruction , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Francisco . <p> Interest rates <p> One important factor that helped offset the steep dot-com job declines , however , were rock-bottom interest rates . <p> As companies such as Pets.com and Webvan imploded , interest rates were steadily sinking to levels unseen in decades , providing a cushion for a housing market . <p> In contrast , the benchmark 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate jumped north of 18 percent in the early 1980s , squashing demand for housing and pushing prices lower . <p> " We would have had a ( housing ) correction in 2001 , 2002 and 2003 if interest rates had n't been cut as they were , " said Ken Rosen , chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC Berkeley . <p> Rosen believes low rates and easy credit have borrowed demand from the future and guided many recent buyers into riskier loans . <p> Last year , about half of Bay Area home buyers took out interest-only loans , according to San Francisco 's LoanPerformance.com . These loans require no principal payments during an initial period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments jump as principal payments start coming due . With interest rates expected to rise gradually through the year , payments could soar even higher , putting some borrowers into precarious financial positions . <p> Affordability <p> The high use of interest-only loans illustrates the eroding ability of many consumers to buy ever-pricier homes , which some experts liken to a balloon that eventually hits the ceiling . <p> While the average pre-tax household income in San Francisco between 2000 and 2004 grew about 16 percent , from $64,818 to $75,390 , home prices rocketed nearly 43 percent  --  and probably more in some desirable areas . <p> According to the California Association of Realtors , only 12 percent of Bay Area households can afford the median-priced home . <p> " We 're really shrinking the number of people who can buy in the marketplace , " said Keitaro Matsuda , senior economist at Union Bank of California . " If the market conditions weaken , that could show up more dramatically because there are so few people who can step in and play the game . " <p> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . For one , roughly three-quarters of all home buyers in California are trade-up buyers who can spin equity into down payments on bigger , pricier houses . <p> Renting vs. buying <p> As home prices rose at a record pace , rents have lagged far behind  --  a fact that alarms some economists who believe monthly prices in the two markets can not remain far apart for too long . <p> The cost of the good , in this case the selling price , should reflect the potential income , rent , for the same property . <p> According to DataQuick , the typical Bay Area home buyer committed to a monthly mortgage payment of $2,867 in December . Meanwhile , the average apartment rent in the region in the fourth quarter was just over $1,324 , according to RealFacts , a Novato firm that tracks the rental market . <p> To some , that discrepancy is yet another sign of an overvalued purchase market . <p> " There 's a disconnect between the fundamental value of the asset and the value the market is producing , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UCLA . " It 's just like the dot-com period . " <p> Feathering the nest <p> But assigning an arbitrary upper limit on the value of real estate may not accurately reflect consumers ' nuanced views of their abodes , particularly compared with a rental apartment . <p> In the aftermath of the Nasdaq nosedive ( and accompanying low interest rates ) and Sept. 11 , there was a noteworthy shift to real estate as a safe investment haven . Refinancings and second home purchases soared , and streets were clogged with contractors ' trucks and appliance stores ' vans as homeowners beautified their nests to boost value . <p> Still , there is some concern that too many consumers are devoting exorbitant portions of their incomes toward housing , and therefore remain vulnerable to a slackening in the market . A 2005 Public Policy Institute of California study found that 1 out of every 5 recent home buyers in the state is spending 50 percent or more of his or her income on housing costs  --  twice the national average . <p> Flipping <p> There is a certain class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profits . But in the Bay Area that percentage is fairly low when compared with Las Vegas or Phoenix , or even Hawaii . <p> Early in 2005 , DataQuick reported that the percentage of San Francisco properties " flipped , " or bought and sold within the previous six months , had risen from less than 2 percent between 2001 and 2004 to nearly 5 percent . <p> In other markets with a larger supply of land and freewheeling building environment , however , that percentage can be well into the double digits . Economists keep a close eye on the number of pure investors in a given market , because their lemming-like movements into and out of housing can often prompt a rapid change . <p> It appears the portion of Bay Area real estate owned by investors is a far cry from those in Southern California in the late 1980s , just before the market tanked . <p> " We 'd drive through new developments , and we 'd see no landscaping , no cars in the driveway , " Matsuda said . " We asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to flip . " <p> Stickiness <p> Money poured into a home is unlike any other investment  --  people are loathe to make less on a sale than their neighbors . <p> In official economic parlance , that 's called " stickiness . " <p> In other words , even in a slackening market , sellers often resist losing money on a property or simply not making as much as the Joneses next door . Sometimes that can mean sales volumes will decline , but prices will stay resilient ; it 's a phenomenon that could play out as this cycle wears on . <p> " We love our homes  --  we do n't love our shares of GM or Microsoft , " Leamer said . " We have a personal valuation of the home because of a vague understanding of the marketplace . " <p> In a booming market , buyers love your home more than you do , Leamer said . But in a downturn , you love it more than they . <p> Supply and demand <p> Another factor that may help support the market , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new homes . <p> In the past few years , the number of houses and condos built in the region has topped 25,000 per year  --  the number California Building Industry Association economist Alan Nevin says is necessary to keep up with job growth and new households . But that number has slipped as low as 15,500 in recent years . <p> " San Francisco may have more of a chance to not have a severe ( correction ) because it 's so hard to build here , " said UC Berkeley 's Rosen . " The difficulty in putting on new supply protects home prices from big adjustments . " <p> Though it 's probably safe to say the Bay Area does n't have a glut of new homes on the market , there are some signs of softness . Building giant Centex recently offered buyers in communities from Benicia to Brentwood discounts of between $40,000 and $100,000 on selected models for a limited period . <p> " People are rejecting higher prices , and in single-family homes in particular , prices have gotten so high that it 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status <p> A tight supply of available land and housing supply is one hallmark of what Columbia University real estate professor Christopher Mayer calls a " superstar city , " one in which price declines are relatively rare . <p> The other is what he calls the concentration of " high human capital workers "  --  or a wealthy , educated labor pool . The argument goes that as San Francisco and New York and Boston shifted from manufacturing centers to technology and service hubs , they grew more expensive and attracted people who can afford to live there  --  people whose incomes ( or maybe wealth ) are going up at faster and faster rates . <p> " The rich can outbid the poor for the limited slots , " Mayer said . <p> The cycle feeds on itself , and these cities draw people from all over the country and the globe . <p> " People ask why are home prices so high in California , and my response is : ' Everybody in the world wants to live in California , ' " said Michael Carney , real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the end , prices are likely to slow and even dip as we enter the end of this real estate cycle . But in the past , it has taken wrenching changes in the economy to seriously rein back the housing market .
