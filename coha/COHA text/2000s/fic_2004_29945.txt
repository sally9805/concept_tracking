Chapter One The Antietam Creek Project came to a rude halt when the blade of Billy Younger 's backhoe unearthed the first skull . It was an unpleasant surprise for Billy himself , who 'd been squatting in the cage of his machine , sweating and cursing in the vicious July heat . His wife was staunchly opposed to the proposed subdivision and had given him her usual high-pitched lecture that morning while he 'd tried to eat his fried eggs and link sausage . For himself , Billy did n't give a rat 's ass one way or the other about the subdivision . But a job was a job , and Dolan was paying a good wage . Almost good enough to make up for Missy 's constant bitching . Damn nagging had put him off his breakfast , and a man needed a good breakfast when he was going to be working his tail off the rest of the day . And what he had managed to slurp up before Missy nagged away his appetite was sitting uneasily in his gut , stewed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rammed the controls , had the satisfaction of knowing his machine would never bitch his ears off for trying to do the job . Nothing suited Billy better , even in the god-awful sweaty clutch of July , than plowing that big-ass blade into the ground , feeling it take a good bite . But scooping up a dirty , empty-eyed skull along with the rich bottomland soil , having it leer at him in that white blast of midsummer sunlight was enough to have 233-pound Billy scream like a girl and leap down from the machine as nimbly as a dancer . His co-workers would razz him about it unmercifully until he was forced to bloody his best friend 's nose in order to regain his manhood . But on that July afternoon , he 'd run over the site with the same speed and determination , and damn near the agility , he 'd possessed on the football field during his high school heyday . When he 'd regained his breath and coherency , he reported to his foreman , and his foreman reported to Ronald Dolan . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been exhumed by curious laborers . The medical examiner was sent for , and a local news team arrived to interview Billy , Dolan and whoever else could help fill up the airtime on the evening report . Word spread . There was talk of murder , mass graves , serial killers . Eager fingers squeezed juice out of the grapevine so that when the examination was complete , and the bones were deemed very old , a number of people were n't sure if they were pleased or disappointed . But for Dolan , who 'd already fought through petitions , protests and injunctions to turn the pristine fifty acres of boggy bottomland and woods into a housing development , the age of the bones did n't matter . Their very existence was a major pain in his ass . And when two days later Lana Campbell , the transplanted city lawyer , crossed her legs and gave him a smug smile , it was all Dolan could do not to pop her in her pretty face . " You 'll find the court order fairly straightforward , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd been one of the loudest voices against the development . At the moment , she had quite a bit to smile about . " You do n't need a court order . I stopped work . I 'm cooperating with the police and the planning commission . " " Let 's just consider this an additional safety measure . The County Planning Commission has given you sixty days to file a report and to convince them that your development should continue . " " I know the ropes , sweetheart . Dolan 's been building houses in this county for forty-six years . " He called her " sweetheart " to annoy her . Because they both knew it , Lana only grinned . " The Historical and Preservation Societies have retained me . I 'm doing my job . Members of the faculty from the University of Maryland archaeology and anthropology departments will he visiting the site . As liaison , I 'm asking you to allow them to remove and test samples . " " Attorney of record , liaison . " Dolan , a strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in his desk chair . Sarcasm dripped from his voice . " Busy lady . " He hooked his thumbs in his suspenders . He always wore red suspenders over a blue work shirt . Part of the uniform , as he thought of it . Part of what made him one of the common men , the working class that had made his town , and his country , great . Whatever his bank balance , and he knew it to the penny , he did n't need fancy clothes to show himself off . He still drove a pickup truck . American-made . He 'd been born and raised in Woodsboro , unlike the pretty city lawyer . And he did n't need her , or anybody else , to tell him what his community needed . The fact was , he knew better than a lot of the people in the community about what was best for Woodsboro . He was a man who looked to the future , and took care of his own . " We 're both busy people , so I 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was about to wipe that patronizing grin off Dolan 's face . " You ca n't proceed on your development until the site is examined and cleared by the county . Samples need to be taken for that to happen . Any artifacts excavated wo n't be of any use to you . Cooperation in this matter would , we both know , go a long way toward shoring up your PR troubles . " " I do n't look at them as troubles . " He spread his big workingman 's hands . " People need homes . The community needs jobs . The Antietam Creek development provides both . It 's called progress . " " Thirty new homes . More traffic on roads not equipped to handle it , already overcrowded schools , the loss of rural sensibilities and open space . " The " sweetheart " had n't gotten a rise out of her , but the old argument did . She drew a breath , let it out slowly . " The community fought against it . It 's called quality of life . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could respond . " Until the bones are tested and dated , you 're stuck . " She tapped a finger on the court order . " Dolan Development must want that process expedited . You 'll want to pay for the testing . Radiocarbon dating . " " Pay- " Yeah , she thought , who 's the winner now ? " You own the property . You own the artifacts . " She 'd done her homework . " You know we 'll fight against the construction , bury you in court orders and briefs until this is settled . Pay the two dollars , Mr. Dolan , " she added as she got to her feet . " Your attorneys are going to give you the same advice . " Lana waited until she had closed the office door behind her before letting the grin spread across her face . She strolled out , took a deep breath of thick summer air as she gazed up and down Woodsboro 's Main Street . She refrained from doing a happy dance-too undignified-but she nearly skipped down the sidewalk like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . Her home . And had been since she 'd moved there from Baltimore two years before . It was a good town , steeped in tradition and history , fueled by gossip , protected from the urban sprawl by distance and the looming shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains . Coming to Woodsboro had been a huge leap of faith for a born and bred city girl . But she could n't bear the memories in Baltimore after losing her husband . Steve 's death had flattened her . It had taken her nearly six months to find her feet again , to pull herself out of the sticky haze of grief and deal with life . And life demanded , Lana thought . She missed Steve . There was still a hole in her where he 'd been . But she 'd had to keep breathing , keep functioning . And there was Tyler . Her baby . Her boy . Her treasure . She could n't bring back his daddy , but she could give him the best childhood possible . He had room to run now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and a mother who 'd do whatever needed to be done to keep him safe and happy . She checked her watch as she walked . It was Ty 's day to go to his friend Brock 's after preschool . She 'd give Brock 's mother , Jo , a call in an hour . Just to make sure everything was all right . She paused at the intersection , waited for the light . Traffic was slow , as traffic was meant to be in small towns . She did n't look small-town . Her wardrobe had once been selected to suit the image of an up-and-coming lawyer in a major urban firm . She might have hung out her shingle in a little rural dot of less than four thousand people , but that did n't mean she could n't continue to dress for success , She wore a summer blue suit in crisp linen . The classic tailoring complemented her delicate build and her own sense of tidiness . Her hair was a straight swing of sunny blond that brushed the jawline of a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were often mistaken for guileless , a nose that tipped up at the end and a deeply curved mouth . She swung into Treasured Pages , beamed at the man behind the counter . And finally did her victory dance . Roger Grogan took off his reading glasses and raised his bushy silver eyebrows . He was a trim and vigorous seventy-five , and his face made Lana think of a canny leprechaun . He wore a short-sleeved white shirt , and his hair , a beautiful mix of silver and white , exploded in untamed tufts . " You look pretty full of yourself . " His voice was gravel spilling down a steel chute . " Must 've seen Ron Dolan . " " Just came from there . " She indulged herself with another spin before she leaned on the counter . " You should 've come with me , Roger . Just to see his face . " " You 're too hard on him . " Roger tapped a fingertip to Lana 's nose . " He 's just doing what he thinks is right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roger laughed . " Did n't say I agreed with him . Boy 's got a hard head , just like his old man did . Does n't have the sense to see if a community 's this divided over something , you need to rethink . " " He 'll be rethinking now , " Lana promised . " Testing and dating those bones is going to cause him some major delays . And if we 're lucky , they 're going to be old enough to draw a lot of attention-national attention-to the site . We can delay the development for months . Maybe years . " " He 's as hardheaded as you . You managed to hold him up for months already . " " He says it 's progress , " she mumbled . " He 's not alone in that . " " Alone or not , he 's wrong . You ca n't plant houses like a corn crop . Our projections show- " Roger held up a hand . " Preaching to the choir , counselor . " " Yeah . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archaeological survey , we 'll see what we see . I ca n't wait . Meanwhile , the longer the development 's delayed , the more Dolan loses . And the more time we have to raise money . He might just reconsider selling that land to the Woodsboro Preservation Society . " She pushed back her hair . " Why do n't you let me take you to lunch ? We can celebrate today 's victory . " " Why are n't you letting some young , good-looking guy take you out to lunch ? " " Because I lost my heart to you , Roger , the first time I saw you . " It was n't far from the truth . " In fact , hell with lunch . Let 's you and me run off to Aruba together . " It made him chuckle , nearly made him blush . He 'd lost his wife the same year Lana had lost her husband . He often wondered if that was part of the reason for the bond that had forged between them so quickly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute devotion to her son . He had a granddaughter right about her age , he thought . Somewhere . " That 'd set this town on its ear , would n't it ? Be the biggest thing since the Methodist minister got caught playing patty-cake with the choir director . But the fact is , I 've got books to catalogue-just in . Do n't have time for lunch or tropical islands . " " I did n't know you 'd gotten new stock . Is this one ? " At his nod , she gently turned the book around . Roger dealt in rare books , and his tiny shop was a small cathedral to them . It smelled , always , of old leather and old paper and the Old Spice he 'd been sprinkling on his skin for sixty years . A rare bookstore was n't the sort of thing expected in a two-stoplight rural town . Lana knew the bulk of his clientele came , like his stock , from much farther afield . " It 's beautiful . " She traced a finger over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " An estate in Chicago . " His ears pricked at a sound at the rear of the shop . " But it came with something even more valuable . " He waited , heard the door between the shop and the stairs to the living quarters on the second floor open . Lana saw the pleasure light up his face , and turned . He had a face of deep valleys and strong hills . His hair was very dark brown with gilt lights in it . The type , she imagined , that would go silver and white with age . There was a rumpled mass of it that brushed the collar of his shirt . The eyes were deep , dark brown , and at the moment seemed a bit surly . As did his mouth . It was a face , Lana mused , that mirrored both intellect and will . Smart and stubborn , was her first analysis . But perhaps , she admitted , it was because Roger had often described his grandson as just that . The fact that he looked as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of old jeans as an afterthought added sexy to the mix . She felt a pleasant little ripple in the blood she had n't experienced in a very long time . " Doug . " There was pride , delight and love in the single word . " Wondered when you were going to wander down . Good timing , as it happens . This is Lana . I told you about our Lana . Lana Campbell , my grandson , Doug Cullen . " " It 's nice to meet you . " She offered a hand . " We 've missed each other whenever you 've popped back home since I moved to Woodsboro . " He shook her hand , scanned her face . " You 're the lawyer . " " Guilty . I just stopped in to tell Roger the latest on the Dolan development . And to hit on him . How long are you in town ? " " I 'm not sure . " A man of few words , she thought , and tried again . " You do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must be fascinating . " " I like it . " Roger leaped into the awkward pause . " I do n't know what I 'd do without Doug . Ca n't get around like I used to . He 's got a feel for the business , too . A natural feel . I 'd be retired and boring myself to death if he had n't taken up the fieldwork . " " It must be satisfying for both of you , to share an interest , and a family business . " Since Douglas looked bored by the conversation , Lana turned to his grandfather . " Well , Roger , since you 've blown me off , again , I 'd better get back to work . See you at the meeting tomorrow night ? " " I 'll be there . " " Nice meeting you , Doug . " " Yeah . See you around . " When the door closed behind her , Roger let out a steam-kettle sigh . " See you around ' ? That 's the best you can do when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking my heart , boy . " " There 's no coffee . Upstairs . No coffee . No brain . I 'm lucky I can speak in simple declarative sentences . " Continues ...
