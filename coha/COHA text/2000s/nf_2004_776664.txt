Desert Fox // THE TOMAHAWKS WERE SPINNING up in their tubes . // It was November 12 , 1998 . U.S. Marine General Tony Zinni , the commander in chief of United States Central Command ( CENTCOM ) , was standing in his command room overlooking the command center at CENTCOM 's Tampa , Florida , headquarters , leading the preparations for what promised to be the most devastating attack on Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War . // The spacious command center was fitted out with desks , phones , computers , maps , and large and small screens showing updates and the positions of aircraft and ships . In addition to the usual office-type furnishings , the windowed room had secure phones and video communications with Zinni 's superiors and his commanders in the field . It was Zinni 's battle position-the bridge of his ship . // At the end of the First Gulf War , Iraq had agreed to the UN-supervised destruction of its weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) and the programs to develop and build them . That agreement had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up its WMD program , and for the next seven years it had conducted a running battle with UNSCOM , the UN inspection operation in Iraq , to protect its programs in any way possible ... by hiding them , moving them around , lying , stonewalling , delay , and noncooperation. // The two essential issues covered by the UN mandate were compliance and accountability . That is , the inspectors had to ask and get satisfactory answers to these questions : " Are the Iraqis in compliance with the UN requirement to destroy their WMD and completely dismantle their WMD programs ? And are they satisfactorily accounting for the programs and WMD they claim to have destroyed ? " The absence of Iraqi cooperation on both of these issues led UNSCOM to make the obvious assumption that the Iraqis were hiding something-either that the weapons still existed or that the Iraqis at least wanted to maintain their capability to make them . UNSCOM had to look hard at the worst case . // When UNSCOM had persisted in carrying out the UN mandate , the Iraqis had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do its job . There had been greater and greater threats and intimidation , lies , obstruction , and hostility ... allied with a diplomatic assault aimed at splitting off powerful states friendly to Iraq ( principally France , Russia , and China ) from the rest of the Security Council and using their support to sabotage the disarmament effort . // With each Iraqi escalation came a counterthreat from the United States : " If UNSCOM is forced to leave Iraq with their work unfinished , the U.S. will hit Iraq and hit it hard . " The threat caught the Iraqis ' attention . As each escalation neared its climax , and the inspectors started to pull out of the country , the Saddam Hussein regime blinked , backed down , and let them return-though each time with fewer teeth . // But now it looked like the Iraqis were not going to blink . The day before , November 11 , the UN inspection teams had left once again , apparently for good . As they left , President Clinton had given Zinni the signal to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment was approaching for the cruise missile launch-the moment of truth . These were n't airplanes . Once the Tomahawks were in the air , they could not be recalled . // Before him was an open line to the White House , where the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) vice-chairman , Air Force General Joe Ralston , was sitting . Before him , too , was another line to his Navy component commander , Vice Admiral Willy Moore , in Bahrain . Moore was in constant communications with the eight ships that would launch the initial cruise missile salvo . The clock ticked on . // The twenty-four hours passed . Zinni had told the President that the strike could be stopped at any moment up to six hours before the bombs were scheduled to hit . That was the drop-dead time for a no-go decision . As it happened , he had built in fifteen minutes of fudge time as a safety margin . // But the no-go deadline had passed . And so had Zinni 's fifteen minutes of fudge time . // He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit up : Saddam was backing down again . He 'd agreed to UNSCOM 's demands . // General Ralston 's voice came down the wire : " It 's a no-go . Do n't shoot , " he told Zinni . " Do we have any time left ? Is it okay ? " // Zinni honestly did n't know . All he could do was grab the phone and call Willy Moore .... // FOR ZINNI , this story had begun fifteen months before , on August 13 , 1997 , when he 'd been appointed the sixth CINC ( commander in chief ) of CENTCOM. // As commander , Zinni watched over a vast region including most of the Middle East , East Africa , and Southwest and Central Asia . His challenges were legion : the delicate , complex relationships with his regional allies ; the rising threat of terrorism , led by the not yet world-famous Osama bin Laden ; the growing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the chronic problems of failed or incapable states , civil wars , border disputes , and criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult task of containing the two regional hegemons , Iran and Iraq . // Though he would have preferred a balanced approach to all the regional issues rather than having to concentrate his energies and CENTCOM 's capabilities on America 's obsession with Saddam Hussein , by far Zinni 's biggest challenge proved to be enforcing the UN-imposed post-Gulf War sanctions on Saddam 's regime . In his view , Saddam could be contained and marginalized ; making him the issue only gave him more clout and distracted the U.S. from more important regional issues , such as the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , Iran , terrorism , and the building of security relationships . // Not long after he became CINC , he proposed a six-point strategic program to William Cohen , President Clinton 's Secretary of Defense , aimed at this more balanced approach . After a polite hearing with Cohen and a session with the Senate Majority and Minority Leaders and the Speaker of the House , Zinni was told to stay out of policy and to stick to execution . " Yes , sir , " he said-always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iraq problem was once again brought home only five days after he took command , at an extended meeting at CENTCOM headquarters with Ambassador Richard Butler , the new head of UNSCOM . CENTCOM provided support for UNSCOM with UN-supervised U-2 flights over Iraq . // Zinni was already familiar with these missions . Before his appointment as commander , he had , as General Peay 's deputy , coordinated the CENTCOM support missions with Butler 's predecessor , Rolf Ekeus. // On the face of it , UNSCOM 's mandate was straightforward . UN Resolution 687 , which set up UNSCOM ( and which Iraq had accepted and agreed to support ) , had directed Iraq to " destroy , remove , or render harmless " its WMD and any missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometers . This process was to have three stages : Iraq would declare its WMD and missiles , UNSCOM would verify the declaration as accurate , and then together UNSCOM and the Iraqis would destroy them . // The Iraqis had given Ekeus a hard time ; but his problems were nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of his successor . Iraqi efforts to conceal their WMD programs-their " hideous charade , " in Butler 's words-were to have dramatic consequences for Tony Zinni. // THOUGH TONY ZINNI did not look like a recruiting poster , he was instantly recognizable as a Marine . He was slightly under medium height , solidly built , barrel-chested , with dark hair cut in the jarhead Marine fashion-very short with shaved back and sides . His look was normally intent , thoughtful , direct , and friendly ; laughter came easily to him ; and he had the social openness , warmth , and common touch that came from long exposure to all kinds and varieties of people . Hardened by a lifetime of military service-and most especially by Vietnam , which had radically changed him-tough decisions did n't faze him . // Before becoming the head of UNSCOM , Richard Butler had been the Australian ambassador to the UN , with considerable expertise in arms control and WMD issues . Like Zinni , he came out of a working-class urban Catholic background ( Zinni grew up in Philadelphia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a burly , physically imposing man , friendly , direct , outspoken , and tough . // Not surprisingly , the two men connected easily . Both men listened well and were not reluctant to express their views . // Butler 's first words to Zinni made it clear that he would not play favorites . He 'd call the pitches as he saw them . But a successful outcome to the inspections was all up to the Iraqis . If they opened up and came clean with their missiles and WMD , he would give them a clean bill of health , and they 'd get their reward-the lifting of the draconian sanctions imposed as a consequence of their invasion of Kuwait in 1990. // So far they had shown zero inclination to come clean-anything but-while crying crocodile tears over their fellow Iraqis , who were enduring the terrible sanctions imposed by the American Satan . ( Saddam 's henchmen , meanwhile , lived royally in palaces. ) // When it came down to the naked truth , Saddam 's regime was far more interested in keeping their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet if they could get the sanctions removed while keeping their WMD , all the better . // Butler had no illusions about the other players in this high-stakes game , either : he was well aware that the Americans had their own agenda-not to mention the UN bureaucracy , the French , the Russians , the Chinese , and everyone else with a stake in what went on inside the nation with the world 's second-largest proven oil reserves ... a nation whose government was arguably the most repressive since Stalin 's USSR. // The Iraqis , well aware of these agendas , played everyone off against each other , trying various gambits aimed at ending or at least weakening UNSCOM-from conning Butler , to putting a wedge in the Security Council , to appealing to the Secretary-General for a diplomatic solution ( meaning a diplomatic surrender to Iraq ) . The Iraqis rightly believed that the French , Russians , and Chinese would stand to gain if the sanctions were removed ; but their backing had conditions . It had to be covered over by a mask of support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also rightly believed that the Secretary-General and his staff were hopeful of attaining a " diplomatic solution , " even if that meant sacrificing the Security Council 's goal of achieving Iraqi disarmament . // The U.S. agenda was even more subtle and complex . The Americans were increasingly coming to understand that disarmament would never happen with Saddam in power . It was therefore not in their interest for the Iraqis to be seen to comply with UN directives and thus to have the sanctions lifted . In the American view , if Saddam appeared to comply with the inspectors , seemed to meet the conditions set by the UN resolution , and was given a clean bill of health , then he would no doubt restart the WMD programs he had not successfully protected from inspection . // As time passed , the Americans ' goal for Iraq shifted from the WMD-sanctions equation to regime change-a goal they could not openly advocate because of the UN resolutions they had backed . Yet it was clear they had no intention of dropping the sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make Richard Butler 's job any easier . It obviously meant there was no motivation for Saddam to comply with the UN conditions . If the regime and not the WMD was the issue , then there was no reason for them not to keep the WMD programs .... Of course , that was an excuse and not a reason . Saddam intended to keep his programs no matter what . // OVER THE next months , the Iraqis did their best to scam Butler . The scam did n't work . As they realized he was not a pushover-and was becoming increasingly exasperated by their lies and tricks-they ratcheted up the stakes with attempts at intimidation . By the end of October 1997 , they were putting more and more obstacles in the way of the UNSCOM inspectors , and making serious and quite naked threats . At this point , they had two immediate goals : to protect several key sites they had designated " presidential " ; and to remove anything " American " from the inspection process , including the U-2 flights . ( Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were American. ) // Meanwhile , the Iraqi failure to cooperate had provoked CENTCOM contingency plans for retaliatory air strikes . Though there had been U.S. strikes against the Iraqis before Zinni became CINC , they had been relatively limited . Zinni 's strikes were intended to hurt . // The crisis came to a head in early November , when the Iraqis ordered all the American inspectors to leave Iraq and threatened to shoot down the U-2 . Although hitting the high-flying aircraft would have taken a very lucky shot , it was possible . // The question : How to respond to the threat ? A U-2 mission was scheduled for November 10 . Obviously , an attempt to knock it out would be followed by American bombs . But was the threat alone reason enough to hit Saddam ? // That was Zinni 's position . He did not favor flying the mission , preferring instead to strike Iraq immediately ( based on the threat ) , or else to punish them in other ways , such as increasing the airspace in the no-fly zone/no-drive zone enforcement area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly the U-2 ; and Zinni was ordered to be prepared to conduct immediate air and missile attacks on Iraq if the plane was fired upon . In preparation for the strike , he flew out to the friendly countries in the Gulf to secure agreements to use their airspace , bases , and territorial waters for the strike-a round of visits he would make several times as head of CENTCOM. // On the way , he visited the U-2 pilots at their base in Saudi Arabia . There he learned that the squadron commander had decided to fly the flight himself , an act that impressed Zinni , who later awarded him an air medal for flying into the engagement zones of hostile Iraqi surface-to-air missiles . // Getting agreement from the friendly leaders in the region was not automatic . They were nervous about the strike . Though none had any illusions about the Iraqi leader , they all had a great deal of sympathy for the long-suffering Iraqi people-Arabs , just as they were . A solution that did nothing for the Iraqi people made no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remove Saddam , but in their minds , yet another round of " pinprick " bombings only made him stronger . // In the end , however , they agreed to a strike if the U-2 was fired upon . Despite their serious questions about the benefits of the U.S. air strikes , they always came through with their support ( contrary to U.S. media reports ) , but preferred to keep the extent of their support private . //
