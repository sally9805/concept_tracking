<p> Editor 's note : Tech21 is a new column that will appear in this space on Mondays . Written by Chronicle staff writer and technology buff Henry Norr , it will focus on developments in computing and communications that will shape our lives in the 21st century : gadgets and gizmos , tips and tricks , fundamental innovations and important issues . <p> Sometimes I wonder how long it will be before we 've covered the planet pole-to-pole with plastic water bottles and used-up batteries . With recycling lagging and Miller putting its beers in plastic , the outlook is n't good on the bottle front . <p> But a solution may be in sight for the battery problem : Replace them with " fuel cells , " devices that produce energy by putting hydrocarbons such as methanol and ethanol through a catalytic process , producing only heat , carbon dioxide , and water vapor as byproducts . <p> Most of the buzz about fuel cells involves the automobile , because Detroit , with help from Washington , is spending billions to see whether the devices will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Robert Hockaday , that 's starting from the wrong end of the stick . It 'll be years , most experts agree , before fuel-cell technology is up to the huge challenge of powering cars and trucks . <p> Hockaday , a former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist who says he has been fascinated by fuel cells since childhood , thinks it makes more sense to start small  --  with " micro-fuel cells " just big enough to charge cell phones , digital cameras , pocket organizers and other miniature devices . <p> More than a decade ago , Hockaday formed a company , Energy Related Devices , to pursue that idea as well as solar-energy research , and in 1995 he left Los Alamos to devote himself full time to his startup . Two years ago , he won funding from Manhattan Scientifics , a New York technology incubator . <p> In February , Manhattan Scientifics announced that Hockaday 's group had reached an important milestone : a micro-fuel cell that puts out three times as much energy as conventional cell-phone batteries . The long-term target , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prototype of a product based on the technology , aimed at the hot cell-phone market , will be ready in the fall , he says . Assuming Manhattan succeeds in finding a manufacturing and marketing partner for the technology , it should reach the market sometime next year . <p> In its initial incarnation the device will supplement rather than replace conventional batteries  --  it wo n't deliver enough power to run a phone by itself , but it will provide a steady trickle charge to keep the regular batteries ( any kind but NiCad ) from running down . It 'll weigh only a couple of ounces , according to Hockaday , and users will be able to attach it directly to the phone , like the secondary batteries some phonemakers already offer , or keep it in a " power holster " in a purse or clipped to a belt . <p> All users will have to do is replace a tiny cylinder containing methanol and water every three weeks or so . In return , they can expect at least three times as much talk time and standby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another dreamer with a tiny startup and a cockamamy scheme that 'll never make it to market ? Could be , but after spending an hour or two on the phone with him , I do n't think so . Industry Week magazine last year named his micro-fuel cells " Technology of the Year . " And industry giants such as Motorola and Samsung are reportedly working hard on similar projects , though Hockaday says he 's pretty sure he 's still in the lead . <p> The big question is not whether Hockaday is on to some important technology , but whether he and his associates will be able to line up the resources needed to commercialize it before competitors catch up . I 'm rooting for him . <p> You can find out more about Hockaday and his fuel cells at his Web site ( **27;332;TOOLONG ) and Manhattan Scientifics ' site ( www.mhtx.com ) . <p> LOCKING DOWN THE PC <p> I have DSL at home , the kind of " always-on " connection that theoretically makes my computers ( I have lots of them ) a potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems off when I 'm not using them , and I do n't have any deep , dark secrets on them anyway , I never worried much about security . <p> Then , one night in February , I accidentally left a PC on overnight . The next morning I found a bizarre dialogue box on its screen : " Fetch callback failed , " it said . The only button was labeled " Ouch . " <p> A few days later , Yahoo , then a list of other high-profile Web sites , began falling victim to a wave of denial-of-service attacks . Experts said the floods of data that shut them down came from computers where hackers had , without their owners ' knowledge , planted malicious applications . <p> I decided it was time to get serious about security , or at least about assessing the magnitude of the threat . <p> My first move was to do some online research on " personal firewall " software , programs that monitor network traffic and attempt to block unauthorized intrusions . Symantec 's entry in that category , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the sources I checked said BlackICE , a $39.95 program from a San Mateo company called Network ICE , was considerably simpler and at least as effective . <p> So I got an evaluation copy of the program , loaded it up , and left my PC on for a month to see what would happen . BlackICE , which runs constantly in the background , logs everything it considers an intrusion , recording the IP address the suspect data packets came from and what the program thinks they were up to . <p> I was astonished at the results . In just a month , BlackICE recorded 23 intrusions from sites all over the world , the first from a domain called celery.mit.edu , but most from abroad  --  Taiwan , Japan , Germany , Israel , Brazil and a lot of other addresses I did n't recognize . <p> One nice feature of BlackICE is its " AdvICE " button : You can click it after selecting an entry in the program 's log , and it opens your browser to a page on the publisher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . <p> None of those it recorded on my machine were actually destructive ; they were all just " probes " attempting to elicit responses that would indicate a security hole the hacker could come back to exploit in the future . In most cases , according to the explanations BlackICE provided , the probes were looking for known vulnerabilities in Solaris , Linux or other forms of Unix , not for Windows problems . <p> I ca n't be sure that the packets BlackICE considered suspect really were ill-intentioned , nor that the addresses it recorded were those the probes really came from . And as best I can tell , none of the intrusions would have actually produced a harmful result even if I had n't had BlackICE to protect me . <p> But the number of PCs and Macs with always-on cable and DSL connections is exploding , and it seems it 's only a matter of time before hackers start finding ways to penetrate such machines and hijack them for nefarious purposes . Under the circumstances , running a firewall program seems only prudent . Personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I 'm not using them , but I 'm keeping BlackICE installed just in case . <p> If you want to learn more about PC security , one excellent resource is the ShieldsUp Web site ( grc.com/x/ne.dll ? bh0bkyd2 ) . <p> LET 'S HEAR FROM YOU <p> Make this new column an interactive experience  --  pass on your reactions to what I write , or your own insights about the technology scene and your tips about cool new products and services . I ca n't provide individual tech support or buying advice  --  I do n't get paid to do that  --  and though I 'll respond , either directly or in print , to as much of your mail as I can , odds are I wo n't have time to reply to everyone . But I 'll read everything you send , and I 'll take it seriously . <p> E-mail Henry Norr at hnorr@sfgate.com.
