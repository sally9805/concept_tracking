All those times me and Skip tried to kill his little brother , Donny , were just for fun . I keep telling the deputies this , and they keep picking up their Styrofoam cups of coffee and walking away only to return a few seconds later and heave their fat butt cheeks onto the metal-topped table in front of me and flash me sad , weary stares that would be almost tender if they were n't filled with so much hatred . They tell me they do n't care about Skip and Donny . They 're not interested in stuff I did when I was a kid . I 'm twenty years old now . I will be TRIED AS AN ADULT . The words come out of their mouths in Skoal-flavored capital letters and hover against the fluorescent glare of the room . I reach out to touch them but before I can , they melt away again and one of the deputies slaps down my hands stained the color of a dead rose . They wo n't let me wash them . They want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? My life is lousy with women . All ages , shapes , sizes , and levels of purity . " The dead woman in the abandoned mining office behind the railroad tracks , " one of them says , making a face like he might puke . I close my eyes and picture it . The roof with gaping holes . The rotting floorboards scattered with broken window glass , rusted screws and bolts , and pieces of flattened iron that used to be part of something bigger a long time ago . When I finally took her there , she did n't ask me to sweep it out . She said she did n't want to change anything about it because she knew it was a special place for me . She said she loved the calm of decay and desertion that reigned there . She liked art and sometimes the way she talked sounded like a painting . Rage starts building inside me , nicely and neatly , like a perfect pyramid of sticks being piled up for a fire . My hands start shaking , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me and Skip used the mining office for our secret hideout , " I answer , smiling , while the blaze roars to life inside me . Soon I will be nothing but a black skeleton of ash that the slightest touch will cause to crumble . But no one on the outside will know . The deputies shake their heads and groan and snort at the mention of Skip . One of them kicks a folding chair across the room . Another one says , " The kid 's in shock . " The other one says , " We 're not going to get anything RELEVANT or COHERENT out of him tonight . " I reach for those words too and this time I get the side of my head smacked instead of my sticky hands . " You better start talking , " the sheriff says , pausing to spit a brown bullet of chew into an empty coffee can before adding , " son , " to his suggestion . He 's the only one here I know . I remember him from my mom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself up willingly after shooting my dad . He smells like a wet couch . I do start talking but all that comes out is the same stuff about me and Skip again , how we used to spend hours in the old mining office eating bologna sandwiches and hatching our plans against Donny . We called it secret even though Donny knew where we were . It was secret because he could n't get to it . He was too little to make it up the hill and through the vicious undergrowth surrounding the place like nature 's barbed wire . We came up with some great ones . Once we bent down a birch sapling and anchored it to the ground with a tent stake and tied a rope loop to it , then lured Donny into the middle with a shiny foil-wrapped HoHo . The tree was supposed to break free and fling him to his death by his ankles , but we realized too late we had n't figured out a way to make it do this , and Donny just finished the HoHo and left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back porch steps and yelled at him to come outside , we had a box of Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies for him . He came tearing out of the house but instead of slipping and falling on the marbles , he skidded to a stop and sat down and played with them . Another time we promised him a box of Little Debbie Star Crunches if he would let us tie up his feet and hands and lay him on the railroad tracks but they were freight tracks  --  the same ones that run by the old mine  --  and we all knew a train had n't been down them since before we were born . Donny got bored waiting to die and started wriggling toward home on his belly . Our most ingenious plan was probably the time we put a pack of Dolly Madison Zingers beneath the open garage door , and we hid out with the garage door opener and clicked it on when Donny sat down to eat . He did n't notice or did n't care about the heavy door grinding down toward his skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were finally going to succeed , but I lost my nerve and ran and yanked him to safety . I saved him . I ca n't seem to make the police understand what this says about my character . " That 's the closest I ever came to murder , " I explain , " up until my dad ... " The sheriff interrupts me . He does n't want me to go into that again . He knows all about my mom and dad . Everybody does . It was in the papers and all over TV . He was the one who was there , he reminds me . Not me . I was n't even home . He was the one who walked in and found my mom with a bucket of red sudsy water calmly scrubbing the stains off her kitchen wallpaper while her husband lay a foot away stuck to the tile in a pool of tarry blood staring right at her with hunting trophy eyes . He was the one who found my baby sister huddled in one of the doghouses with vomit all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw up ; and Jody never even liked Dad . He was the one who watched Dad get zipped into a body bag . Not me . I never got to see him again . It was a closed casket funeral . I 'm not sure why . Mom shot him in the back . It 's been almost two years now , the sheriff reminds me . No one cares anymore . It 's not RELEVANT . " Define relevant , " I say . The deputy who keeps hitting me grabs me by the front of my dad 's camouflage hunting jacket and pulls me out of my chair . He has big sweat stains under his armpits . Eighty-five today . Hot for the first week of June . " Tell us about the woman , " he shouts at me . I do n't know why they wo n't say her name . I guess they 're waiting for me to say it . For me to admit I knew her . Well , of course , I did . They know I did . He drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADULT appears in front of my eyes bright and buzzing like neon . I do n't know why I ca n't talk about her . Each time I open my mouth something about Skip comes out , and he 's not even my friend anymore . I always knew Skip would leave . His constant scheming never seemed a part of these quiet , wounded hills the way Donny 's blind love of snack cakes did . Donny will be here forever . I see him every morning on my way to work at the Shop Rite waiting on the side of the road for the school bus like a stump . " Skip 's away at college now , " I say . I 'm still staring at the words so I do n't see the fist coming . I feel the warmth of blood gush down my chin before I feel the pain . Bright red droplets spatter onto the front of Dad 's coat where her blood has already dried into a brown crust . They keep trying to make me take off the coat . People are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Jesus Christ , Bill , did you have to do that ? " I think the sheriff 's up for reelection next year . I guess I 'll be old enough to vote then if I want . VOTE AS AN ADULT . I think I would probably vote against him though . It 's not that I dislike the guy , and I do n't know anything about his stands on law enforcement issues so I ca n't say I disagree with him . My vote would be based solely on smell . I touch my smashed nose and decide to tell them the TRUTH . Who 's to blame . Who 's at fault . Who should be locked up . I have nothing to be afraid of anymore . What will I be giving up by losing my freedom ? What will the world be giving up by losing me ? I told her once I was n't good at anything . She ran her thumb over my lips raw from kissing her and said survival was a talent .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
