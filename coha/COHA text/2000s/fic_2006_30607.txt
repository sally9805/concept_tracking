Southern California Warm and motionless nights were natural in LA , a place where so much of life was staged and the weather seldom competed for attention . Here , events and people stood in the limelight . On most nights , somewhere in the city , searchlights panned the sky ; tonight , in front of the La Cienega Art Gallery . All the art show regulars were there in force , names from the society pages , old money and new , along with enough existentialist poets and bohemians to fill every coffeehouse from Hollywood to Hermosa Beach . Well-known art critics chatted about perspective and meaning , debated social message . They adored the artist , a vibrant , exotic woman whose huge canvases had violent splashes of color charging across them , and wrote about her work in effusive terms as bold as the work itself , likening her to the abstract expressionists Pollock and de Kooning . Rachel Espinosa was the darling of the LA art scene , and Rudy Banning 's wife . Rudy came to the show late , after drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sucker  --  something that was easier to swallow if he chased it with a bottle of scotch . The searchlights were off when he parked his car outside the gallery . Once inside , he leaned againstthe front door to steady himself . A milky haze of cigarette smoke hovered over the colorless sea of black berets , gray fedoras , and French twists . In one corner , a small band played an odd arrangement of calypso and jazz  --  Harry Belafonte meets Dave Brubeck . The booze flowed , cigarettes were stacked every few feet on tall silver stanchions , and the catering was Catalan  --  unusual  --  and done to propagate the lie that his wife , Rachel Maria-Teresa Antonia Espinosa , was pure Spanish aristocracy . This was her night , and her stamp was on the whole production . She stood near the back half of the room , under a canned light and in front of one of her largest and latest pieces , Ginsberg Howls . The crowd milled around her , but most managed to stay a few feet away , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an icon . A newspaper reporter for the Los Angeles Times interviewed her , while a staff photographer with rolled-up shirtsleeves circled around her , snapping photos with sharp , blinding flashes . Rachel turned on for the camera , striking a carefully choreographed pose Rudy had seen before : arm in the air , a martini glass with three cocktail onions in her hand . Tonight she wore bright orange . She knew her place in this room . Rudy helped himself to a drink from a cocktail tray carried by a passing waiter , then downed the whiskey before he was ten feet away from her . She did n't see him at first , but turned with instinctive suddenness and looked right at him . What passed between them was merely a ghost of what had been  --  the days when one look across a room could evaporate everything around them . His wife 's expression softened , until he set his empty drink on a passing tray and grabbed another full one , then raised the glass mockingly and drank it as she watched him , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quickly , then turned to the reporter . " Excuse me . " She rushed forward hands outstretched . " Rudy ! " When he did n't take her hands , she slid her arm through his and moved toward a corner . " You 're late . " " Really ? " Rudy looked around . " What time was this charade supposed to start ? " " You 're drunk . You reek of scotch . " She pulled him away from the crowd . " Are you trying to shove me off into a corner ? I 'm six foot four . A little hard to hide . " Rudy stopped bullishly and turned so she was facing the room . " You crave attention so much . Look . People are staring . " " Stop it ! " Her voice was quiet and angry . " I know , Rachel . " " Of course you know . No one force-fed you half a bottle of scotch . " Her deep breath had a tired sound . " Dammit , Rudy . Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her fingers tightened around his arm . Murmurs came from those nearby , and people eased closer . " I know , " he said with emphasis . The music faded and the room quickly grew quiet . Rudy had the laughable thought that if it was n't a show before , it certainly was one now . " What are you talking about ? " Apparently lying and persona were all that was left of the woman he 'd married . Strange how confronting her felt nothing like he 'd imagined . " You want me to shout it ? Here ? For everyone ? " He waved his hand around . " For that reporter , darling ? " His breath was shallow , like he 'd been running miles . His vision blurred around the edges , and the taste of booze lodged in his throat . " I will shout it to the world . Damn you . Damn you , Rachel ! " He threw his drink at the painting behind her , and the glass shattered in a perfectly silent room . He stumbled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curb , he used the car 's fin to steady himself , then got inside . Rachel came running outside . " Rudy ! " He jammed his key in the ignition . She pulled open the passenger door . " Stop ! Wait ! " " Go to hell . " She crawled inside and tried to grab the keys . " Do n't leave . " Rudy grabbed her wrist , pulled her across the seat until her face was inches from his . " Get out or I 'll drag you with the car . " He shoved her away and started the engine . " No ! " She closed her door and reached for the keys again . His foot on the gas , the car raced down the street , straddling lanes as he struggled for control . Tires screeched behind them , but he did n't give a damn . " Rudy , stop ! " She sounded scared , so he turned the next corner faster . The car fishtailed and he floored it again . She hugged the door and seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a goddess who painted intricate canvases and saw the world with a mind and eye unlike anyone else 's . Ahead the stoplight turned red . He slammed on the brakes so hard she had to brace her hands on the dashboard . " You 're driving like a madman . Pull over and we can talk . " " There it is again , Rachel , that calm voice . Your reasonable tone , so arrogant , as if you are far above the rest of us mere mortals because you do n't feel anything . " " I feel . You should know . I feel too much . I know you 're upset . We 'll talk . Please . " " Upset does n't even come close to what I am . And it 's too fucking late to talk . " The light turned green and he floored it . " Rudy , stop ! Please . Think of the boys , " she said frantically . " I am thinking of the boys . What about you ? Can you ever think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quickly they faced oncoming traffic , honking horns , the sound of skidding tires . A truck swerved to avoid them . It took both of his hands to pull the careening car into his own lane . At the yellow signal , he lifted his foot off the gas to go for the brake , paused , then stomped on the accelerator . He could make it . " Do n't ! " Rachel shouted . " It 's turning red ! " " Yeah , it is . " He took his eyes off the road . " Scared , Rachel ? Maybe now you 'll feel something . " Her whimpering sound made him feel strong . His father was wrong . He was n't a weak fool . Not anymore . The speedometer needle shimmied toward seventy . The gas pedal was on the floor . He could feel the power of the engine vibrate through the steering wheel right into his hands . " Oh , God ! " Rachel grabbed his arm . " Look out ! " A white station wagon pulled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt the seat back snap . The skid pulled at the steering wheel , and he could hear tires scream and smell the rubber burn . Blue lettering painted on the side of the station wagon grew huge before his eyes : Rock and Roll with Jimmy Peyton and the Fireflies The other driver looked at him in stunned horror , his passengers frantic . One of them had his hands pressed against the side window . A thought hit Rudy with a passive calmness : they were going to die . Rachel grabbed him , screaming . With a horrific bang , her scream faded into a moan . The dashboard came at him , the speedometer needle still shimmying , and everything exploded . Continues ...
