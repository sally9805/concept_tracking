Section : Nation &; World As action in Afghanistan shifts from war to manhunt , the Pentagon steps up planning for the next battle fronts ; %c Tora Bora <p> Closure wo n't be found in an Afghan cave . It wo n't come when the mountain region of Tora Bora is cleared of al Qaeda shock troops , or when U.S. forces finally leave Afghanistan . It wo n't even come when Osama bin Laden is captured or killed  --  although that certainly would help . <p> Instead , it will come only after the fight against global terrorism achieves its declared goal  --  defeating those who put American cities on the front lines of the battlefield . Fifteen weeks after the September 11 attacks and 11 weeks after the payback began , the Pentagon has accomplished most of its military objectives in Afghanistan . The Taliban government has been relegated to a footnote in the long-running history of Afghan civil war , and al Qaeda has lost its freedom to use Afghanistan as its base of operations . Yet U.S. officials are not planning joyous homecomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 of the fight , hunting down and eliminating al Qaeda cells beyond Afghanistan . <p> With the Taliban and al Qaeda leaders still at large , the Afghanistan conflict has become less a war than a high-stakes manhunt . For now , the priority is to ensure that al Qaeda troops fleeing the mountain hideouts in Afghanistan do not escape to fight another day . " Our goal is to stop them , not to simply move the problem from one nation to another , " Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said last week . To aid the hundreds of U.S. special operation forces and marines now hunting the rocky defiles of eastern Afghanistan , Pakistani military troops stepped up patrols along the other side of the porous border in hopes of ensnaring bin Laden 's beleaguered followers . Seven battalions were brought in to hunt around the border town of Parachinar , and female Pakistani border guards started checking beneath the veils of travelers in burkas crossing into Pakistan . <p> With few targets left to hit , the meticulously orchestrated air war has ended , yet American bombers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " targets of opportunity . " One such target was a convoy of al Qaeda trucks hit by U.S warplanes near the eastern town of Khost last week . At the Tora Bora redoubt , where a week ago Pentagon officials were confident they had cornered bin Laden and his coterie of top aides , the greatest hope now is to gather evidence about al Qaeda to help in the global effort to destroy the organization . As for bin Laden himself , one Pentagon spokesman had to concede that his whereabouts were " anyone 's guess . " <p> The Pentagon may have been duped . As the fog of war lifted over Tora Bora , it became increasingly clear that at least some of the Afghan warlords that the U.S. contracted to hunt the mountain complex had participated in a clandestine " underground railroad " to smuggle al Qaeda members out of the region . During a mule ride through several villages along an escape route , Afghan villagers were proud to tell U.S. News that they had helped Arab men , women , and children escape the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a throng of Afghan children . There was talk that bin Laden may even have shaved his beard and donned Western clothes to elude his pursuers . The United States has faced similar frustrations in the south , where some in Washington believe the conquering Pashtun forces turned a blind eye as Taliban forces , including leader Mullah Mohammed Omar , escaped to the hills north of the city . The Pentagon 's best guess is that Omar is holed up in the Helmand province of southern Afghanistan , perhaps guarded by hundreds of die-hard Taliban fighters . <p> Pre-emptive strikes . The good news for the United States is that al Qaeda is out of business in Afghanistan . Its training camps have been destroyed , its leaders are on the lam , and its Taliban protectors are , both physically and politically , in the wilderness . Yet destroying its Afghanistan base will only go so far toward eliminating al Qaeda as a powerful global network . An organization lacking a distinct hierarchy , with independent cells operating in dozens of countries , al Qaeda can function even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and financial pressure . " I see that there is going to be a stuttering in the organization 's momentum , " FBI counterterrorism official J. T. Caruso told Congress last week . " The question is , will that stutter turn into a pause ? I do n't know . " <p> Some experts believe that the organization dedicated to jihad could even become more dangerous . " If anything , they are going to be motivated to seek revenge for Afghanistan , " says Michele Flournoy , a foreign-policy scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank . " This is not a group that 's easily disheartened . " War planners are therefore shifting their focus toward pre-emptive strikes against al Qaeda cells in places like Somalia , Sudan , and Yemen  --  countries with fragile to nonexistent central governments where al Qaeda cells have been able to operate unhindered over the years . U.S. News has learned that the hunt for al Qaeda has even extended to Bosnia . According to one senior Pentagon official , in Bosnia " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding them . " <p> Counterterrorism operations are already underway in Somalia , the place the United States fled in 1994 after ill-fated nation-building efforts and which has been controlled by tribal clans for years . " Somalia is appealing to terrorist organizations because it 's basically the Wild West , " says Flournoy . The country 's ineffective government is aligned with al-Itihaad al Islamiya , or " Islamic Union , " which the United States identifies as a terrorist outfit with links to al Qaeda . For weeks , U.S. Navy ships have been patrolling the sea lanes off Somalia 's coast , on watch for terrorists shuttling in and out of the East African nation . Washington also sent a delegation to the region recently to meet with Somali warlords and Ethiopian military officers to discuss terrorist activities in Somalia . Ethiopia has pledged help in the fight , hoping to wield influence over its neighbor to the east and to get in the good graces of the United States . <p> As lawless countries with little international clout , Somalia and Sudan are tempting targets for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international community than would a large-scale effort to take on Iraq ( box , Page 16 ) . " You wo n't get people at the U.N . who want to run themselves on their sabers about the U.S. invading a sovereign country , " says one former special forces officer . <p> Heavy lifting . Yet the Pentagon would have difficulty copying the formula that worked with great success in Afghanistan : using a small number of special operations forces to train and equip local fighters to do the majority of the fighting on the ground . In Afghanistan , special operations troops transformed a bedraggled group of rebels into a suitable fighting force . " They turned the Northern Alliance into a conquering army , " says Robert Andrews , the top Pentagon official in charge of special operations forces . In places like Somalia and Sudan , there is no enemy government to topple and no rebel army to train . Going after terrorism could therefore take a greater U.S. presence on the ground . " Special ops would not have as much to work with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army Special Forces Command . " Nobody will do the heavy lifting for us . " <p> Moreover , while squabbling ethnic groups in Afghanistan could put aside their differences to fight the Taliban enemy , there is no such unifying force in other terrorist hubs . " What is the rallying point for tribes in Somalia ? " asks one Defense official . " It is n't ridding the country of al Qaeda . " <p> Yet Washington is confident that the Afghanistan example is a powerful disincentive for countries to protect bin Laden and his ilk in the future . " Any country in the world that would knowingly harbor bin Laden would be out of their minds , " said Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz . " I think they 've seen what happened to the Taliban , and I think that 's probably a pretty good lesson to people not to do that . " <p> Such blunt messages are being heeded . Last week , government troops in Yemen raided suspected al Qaeda cells in the country 's eastern hinterland . The impoverished country on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and the site of the 2000 attack on the USS Cole . Eighteen Yemeni soldiers died in the raid , which captured some suspected terrorists , yet many experts believe that it was carried out more to impress Washington than for its expected harvest of al Qaeda operatives . President Bush has stated repeatedly that he is looking for action from any nation wanting to be counted as an ally in the war against terrorism . As he put it last week , " Thank you for your condolences . I appreciate your flowers . Now arrest somebody . " <p> To prepare for future operations , the United States is increasing the number of ground troops in the Middle East , with the 3rd Army moving its headquarters to Kuwait . This move could be the precursor to deployments of 82nd and 101st Airborne units , as well as armored units and mechanized infantry . Should Bush decide to use them , he will have broad public support . According to a recent Gallup Poll , 67 percent of Americans believe the United States should continue military action beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Iraq , the campaign would be a success . <p> For now , war planners continue to recite the mantra that the military work in Afghanistan is still far from complete . There is some calculation in this . U.S. troops still face grave danger from pockets of al Qaeda and Taliban forces , as well as from land mines and incidents like the accidental grenade explosion in a marketplace in Mazar-e Sharif last week that wounded 159 people . If U.S. troops begin dying for what the public perceives as merely a peacekeeping mission , then support for the Afghanistan operation would likely erode . <p> Conscious of this , U.S. officials stress that American troops will not be part of a multinational security force now patrolling the streets of Kabul . That job is being left to British marines , as well as French , Spanish , German , and other European and Asian troops . The United States is trying not to get involved . In Rumsfeld 's words , " We have other things we 're doing . " <p> MAP <p> PHOTO ( COLOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dug in on the Kandahar airport perimeter <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A border too far ?
