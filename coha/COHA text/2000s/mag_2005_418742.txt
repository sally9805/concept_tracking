But perhaps his greatest adventure was a trip inside a Russian MIR submersible vehicle to the wreck site of the Titanic . SUBCAMP 6 STEVE FOSSETT " Each record I set is like I have earned a new Scouting badge , " says Eagle Scout Fossett , who in April 2005 added first solo nonstop round-the-world airplane flight to his long list .

He also holds 10 of the 13 fastest sailing records as certified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council . In gliding Fossett has set speed records for 500 kilometers ( on a triangle course ) and 1,000 kilometers ( out-and-return ) . SUBCAMP 7 KENKAMLER Though he was chosen as one of New York City 's best doctors , Kamler 's work extends far beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) research into human responses to extremely high altitudes . In 1996 , he was climbing Mount Everest when a storm engulfed three teams of climbers , and as the only doctor around , he treated the survivors . Kamler has also worked with National Geographic doing geological research and mapping using laser telescopes and GPS technology . SUBCAMP 8 JAMES A. LOVELL On April 13 , 1970 , Eagle Scout Lovell and his Apollo 13 crew were 200,000 miles above Earth when they heard a loud " bang . " An oxygen tank was leaking , and the craft was losing power . Fortunately , the Eagle Scout was prepared for anything . Lovell , the commander of the mission , and his team rigged up a temporary system with just enough juice to push the spacecraft around the moon and back down to Earth , where they landed safely in the Pacific Ocean . // JIM WHITTAKER // SUBCAMP 9 JIM WHITTAKER In 1963 , Eagle Scout Whittaker was the first American to summit Mount Everest , tallest mountain in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , located on the border of China and Pakistan-in 1978 .

You might know Whittaker best from REI ( Recreational Equipment Inc. ) , the company he helped grow as its president and CEO . // SCOTT CARPENTER // SUBCAMP 10 JIM FOWLER Fowler loves animals , and he loves to talk about them even more . That 's why he has hosted TV shows such as " Wild Kingdom " and " Spirit of Adventure . " And that 's why he has been the wildlife correspondent for the " Today " show since 1988 . Since then , he has used television to educate America on the importance of conservation and the protection of wildlife by appearing on " The Tonight Show " and " Animal Planet . " In 2000 , he launched his own show , " Jim Fowler 's Life in the Wild . " . SUBCAMP 11 SCOTT CARPENTER Talk about extreme sports : Carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lows ( literally ) . One of the seven original Mercury astronauts , he flew the second manned American orbital flight , piloting the Aurora 7 spacecraft three times around the Earth . And how 's this for a " low " ? In 1965 , Carpenter spent 30 days living and working on the sea floor , 205 feet down , as part of the Navy 's Man-in-the-Sea project . He has participated in dives all over the world , including diving underneath the Arctic ice . SUBCAMP 12 JAMES DEWEY WATSON You may remember from science class that a DNA molecule takes the shape of a double helix , or a twisting ladder . That was the idea of Watson and his colleagues . Francis Crick , Maurice Wilkins and Watson won a Nobel Prize in 1962 for their discovery of DNA 's structure . Watson 's later work at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory led to the present understanding of cancer genes and their molecular basis . In addition to the Nobel Prize , he has received a ton of awards for his work , including the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SUBCAMP 13 DON WALSH Brrrrrr ! In 1971 , Walsh was a member of Operation Deep Freeze and spent more than a month exploring Antarctica . His work was so productive that he has a mountain ridge in Antarctica named after him . But Walsh is probably best known for his record-setting dive . On Jan. 23 , 1960 , he piloted the Trieste , a deep-diving vessel owned by the U.S. Navy , down 35,810 feet into the Challenger Deep , an area off the coast of Guam known as the deepest spot in any of the world 's oceans . SUBCAMP 14 RICHARD C. WIESE If a volcano 's erupting , there 's a good chance Wiese will be nearby with cameras rolling . A television journalist and independent documentary film producer , Wiese conducted field research and filmed documentaries during the eruptions of Mount Etna in Sicily , Popocatelpetl in Mexico and Pueblo Soufriere Hills on the Caribbean island of Montserrat . When the cameras were n't rolling , Wiese completed a solo climb of an active volcano in Tanzania for geological sampling . SUBCAMP 15 ROBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt at finding the Titanic . The trip was doomed when a crucial piece of equipment broke free and tumbled to the ocean floor . Ballard had to wait eight years for his second chance , and this time he would n't be denied . On Sept. 1 , 1985 , Ballard and his crew saw pieces of Titanic debris through TV cameras towed just above the ocean floor . One year later , they returned to the site and dived to the wreckage on board Alvin , a deep-sea submersible . // BOB BALLARD // WILL STEGER // SUBCAMP 16 RICHARD WIESE SR . In 1959 , Wiese became the first person to fly solo 9,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean . After delaying his takeoff from San Francisco for three days due to weather , Wiese began his journey at 2:30 a.m . The plane-loaded with extra fuel-struggled to clear the hills bordering the airport , but from then on it was smooth flying . Wiese landed in Australia 42 hours later . He would go on to make the same flight four more times with different planes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johanson and his student Tom Gray were looking for fossils in a ravine in Ethiopia . They ended up discovering " Lucy , " a 3.18-million-year-old skeleton that would change the way scientists believe humans evolved . Lucy was about 3/2 feet tall , with a small brain , long arms , short legs and a large belly , and she walked upright . A year later , Johanson returned to the site and found 13 other skeletons , all of whom seemed to have died at the same moment . SUBCAMP 18 WILLIAM " DOC " FORGEY Looking for ways to protect yourself from disease spread by insects in the wilderness ? see Doc Forgey , a family physician , lifetime outdoorsman and adviser to the Boy Scouts . He has written more than 20 books about wilderness medicine , highlighting simple techniques to prevent bites in even the most extreme conditions . Doc has held leadership positions with the National Health &; Safety Committee , the Wilderness Medical Society and the Wilderness Education Association . SUBCAMP 19 JOSEPH KITTINGER JR . In the 1950 's , the U.S. Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplanes . Kittinger participated by making high-altitude flights in hot-air balloons , and then jumping out . In 1960 , Kittinger climbed his Excelsior II balloon gondola to 102,800 feet before jumping out , freefalling for more than four minutes at speeds greater than 600 miles per hour , enduring temperatures of minus 94 degrees , opening his parachute at 18,000 feet and landing safely on the ground . SUBCAMP 20 WILL STEGER When it comes to dog sledding , Steger holds plenty of records : the first confirmed dogsled journey to the North Pole without stopping for supplies ( 1986 ) , the longest unsupported dogsled expedition in history-1,600 miles across Greenland ( 1988 ) - and the only dogsled traverse of the Arctic Ocean from Russia to Ellesmere Island in Canada ( 1995 ) . He has also been invited twice to testify before Congress on polar and environmental issues . // Sidebar Welcome to Scouting 's premier camping experience-the XVI National Scout Jamboree .
