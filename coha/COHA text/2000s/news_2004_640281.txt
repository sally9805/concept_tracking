<p> Michael Carrazza ca n't say for sure that anyone pays attention when his team flies up the field during a polo match . <p> Crowds may gather under tents at the edge of a 10-acre pitch , ostensibly there to watch men and women on horseback chase after a ball at breakneck speeds . <p> But the crack of maple mallets against the ball and the rumble of high-speed hooves at the 17th Annual Fuller 's Denver Polo Classic today may fall on ears filled instead with champagne fizz and buzz about who 's who on the grounds of the Columbine Polo Club . <p> " It 's not like a game at Coors Field , where you go and take a seat , " says Carrazza , 38 , who assembled a pro/am team to ride in the Classic , a fundraiser for the Denver Active 20-30 Children 's Foundation . <p> Off the field and on , polo in the United States is an intensely social sport . <p> Only about 3,800 people play nationwide , and the network is tight - players who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tournaments are scarce , and media coverage is scant , so big matches often are paired with big events that draw crowds as much for the celebrity sighting potential as the sport . <p> " In some ways polo is a backdrop for a social gathering , " says Susan Koehler , Columbine 's director of development and a 1-goal player . She met her husband , club manager Bobby Koehler , during a polo lesson six years ago . <p> " It 's certainly exciting , with a lot of pageantry and color . It 's also hard . It 's not how people are used to watching sports , " she says . " You know ( Chicago Cubs hitter ) Sammy Sosa because you followed him as a kid , and you know his stats . " <p> Pull out Prince Charles and actor Tommy Lee Jones , and the pool of **37;536;TOOLONG polo players is pretty shallow . " Polo is a bit of a player 's sport , " Koehler , 40 , says . <p> There are 45 or 50 active players in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and southern Wyoming . As is true in the rest of the country , the regional player numbers are up , with the biggest gains among women , who circuit governor Gene Burk says play in a dead heat with men because what they lack in physical strength they make up in finesse . <p> So the sport of kings is no longer relegated to the ranks of the very wealthy and the very male - at least not in Colorado , where polo was pioneered by silver mining kings and carried on for the pure love of the sport . <p> " People play to win , and play by the rules , but we 're not spending a half-million a year on polo here . And there are places you can do that easily , " Burk , 56 , says . " God bless ' em and good luck . " <p> Wealthy sponsors <p> American players follow big-name teams sponsored by wealthy patrons in the United States , Europe and Argentina . They aspire to the finesse and athletic prowess displayed by top players and their highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained to consider themselves just another player on the field , and they know to keep their eye on the ball . At the crack of the mallet , " They will go for it , " Carrazzo says . " They know where they need to be and will get there . " <p> Clyde Canino , 70 , trains ponies at Capitol Park Farm in Boulder County . The horses usually come off the racetrack at 3 or 4 and are smart and agile . <p> After a year and a half to two years under Canino 's mallet - he was a 1-goal player - and maybe another few months in play , the horses are given the badge of a true polo pony : a shaved mane . " That 's when I know we 've hit the horse , " he says . <p> Top professional players pay top dollar for a horse - some Capitol Park Farm ponies sell for upward of $60,000 . <p> Erica Gandomcar , one of the top female players in the country and manager of Cottonwood Riding Club/Denver Polo Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a player 's performance . Gandomcar , 24 , is a 1-goal player who will play on Burk 's team this weekend . <p> A good horse also can help an amateur player progress in his or her game , but pony and rider must be well- <p> matched . Carrazzo 's first time on a horse outside of a trail ride was also his first time on a polo pony , and his mount gave him grief he was n't competent to handle . <p> " The horse was whipping her head down , almost sending me over the handlebars , " Carrazzo said . He switched to an Argentinean mare named Sociedad , and his season changed . <p> " I could not have improved any more quickly . She took care of me on the field , " he says . <p> Carrazzo , a - 1- goal player , acquired Sociedad this spring and will ride her in the tournament weekend , hoping to finish at the top of a six-team heap today . He 'll be helped along by Oklahoma land developer Travis Anderson and two Argentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give Carrazzo 's team , Solaia , an edge , but with only two years of playing experience , he also hopes they will help improve his game . <p> " A hat and boots do n't make a cowboy , " observes Canino , who says playing with high-goal pros in San Antonio , Texas , made him a better rider . " Those pros will help him develop into the player he wants to be . " <p> Denver retailer Robert Kiger , a 0-goal player with 15 years of polo under his belt , also hired a pro , but for a different reason : " to win , baby , " he says . " It 's the glory of the game . " <p> Canino says hiring pros signals a change in Colorado players ' attitude toward polo . When he was recruited to the game 35 years ago by Lawrence Phipps III , polo still had a blue-collar feel . " In my day , the standards were great , but we did n't spend a lot of money . Today , they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win , they want to win . It 's great for polo . " <p> The early days <p> Colorado polo has always been a little catch-as-catch can . Walter Devereux and F. Hervey A. Lyle formed the Glenwood Polo and Racing Association in 1892 and began to field nationally competitive teams who bettered their game by practicing against local cowboys recruited and schooled as competition . <p> Glenwood played teams from Denver and the Cheyenne Mountain Country Club in Colorado Springs and from the 10th Cavalry at Fort Robinson , Neb . <p> Mike Strang , 75 , says " first-rate polo " still is played in the Roaring Fork Valley , at the Aspen , Rose Spur and Roaring Fork polo clubs . The third-generation Colorado rancher was captain of the Princeton University polo team in 1956 . <p> But like many urban polo fields , the Glenwood polo grounds became a neighborhood when the land grew too valuable to hold aside as a polo pitch . <p> On the Front Range , polo pushed south as fields were covered by neighborhoods like the Polo Club and The Polo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fields in Englewood , Littleton , Sedalia , Monument and Boulder County . <p> " The nice part is , there 's always land a little farther west and a little bit down the road , " says Peter Rizzo , U.S. Polo 's interim executive director . " Clubs will sell those valuable fields , level out the next piece of ground and get playing again . Depending on the pocketbook , it can be scrappy , or it can be an emerald carpet . " <p> Staff writer Dana Coffield can be reached at 303-820-1954 or dcoffield@denverpost.com  --  Colorado 's polo clubs are subject to the vagaries of early-summer weather . Organizers last week worried that the Denver Polo Classic finals scheduled for today might be scrubbed because monsoon-style weather had soaked polo fields to the point that play would be dangerous to both player and pony . However , tournament festivities , which benefit Active 20-30 International charities in Denver , will go on rain or shine at Columbine Polo Club , 4401 W.
