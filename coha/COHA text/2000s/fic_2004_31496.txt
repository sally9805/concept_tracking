Commander Andrew Ellis lifted his thumb off the small button concealed in the soil . He regarded Captain Chakotay and his sister , Sekaya , as they lay sprawled on the chalk image his partner had drawn . Unconscious , both of them . Excellent . He pressed a second button , then rose from his kneeling position and dusted off his hands . It took only a few minutes for his ... servants ... to arrive . They were largely silent as they approached , their presence revealed only by the soft swishing of their massive legs through the long grasses . He surveyed them with approval . It could be said they were humanoid in shape , but only vaguely so . Standing well over two meters tall , they had grossly overdeveloped chests and arms , and their mouths were crammed full of sharp teeth . Rusty orange fur covered their bodies , crowned by a ridge of spines that crested along their backs . Small , bright black eyes peered out at their master through thick falls of hair . One of them began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung from its lower lip . Their scent was musky and rank , all the stronger for their present state of excitement . " You , " Ellis said , selecting two at random , " take these two to the center . " He indicated the fallen bodies of Chakotay and Sekaya . " The rest of you , pay attention to me . " He raised his hand and pointed his third and index fingers to his eyes , as he might with a dog he was trying to train . Their eyes fastened on his obediently . " You will find four people in uniforms like this one wandering about . You will attack them . " One of the creatures roared its approval and began to jump about happily . " Silence ! " Ellis cried , irritated . The creature quieted . " You are not to kill them . Understand ? " They looked disappointed . One of them whimpered . Ellis continued . " You are to chase them , frighten them , hurt them if you must , but I will be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find the one who did it and kill him or her . Understand ? " They grunted . " Good . Now . Go and have fun . " The creatures scattered , chittering and hooting , eager to perform so pleasant a duty . The two chosen to bear Chakotay and Sekaya lumbered forward , easily picking up the limp bodies in their powerful arms . Ellis watched them go . Delight was warm inside him . It was all going according to plan . There 'd been a slight glitch when Chakotay had unexpectedly decided to follow regulations regarding the away team , but Ellis had recovered . After some quick thinking , he 'd been able to lure not only the human captain to the planet , but his sister as well . His Cardassian ally would be so pleased . He followed his creatures as they walked to a seemingly solid boulder and passed easily through . It had been difficult to convince them they could safely walk through something their eyes told them was solid . Eventually , though , they became familiar with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs carved into the rock . He could n't wait until Chakotay awoke . Lieutenant Devi Patel loved the sciences . She practically romanced them , sometimes to the exclusion of less intellectual attachments . The only pain her passion for science had ever caused her was at the Academy , when she had been forced to choose a field of specialty . She wished there were such a thing as a " generalist . " Even after choosing biology , she had taken a staggering number of extra courses in other fields to the point where she was practically an expert in all of the sciences . She had decided , reluctantly , to let medicine be one of the fields she could bear to part with . She 'd never felt drawn to be a healer , but rather an explorer . She had an insatiable curiosity that had gotten her into trouble more than once , and a peculiar blend of cheery optimism and logical intellect that had gotten her out of most of the tight spots in which she 'd found herself . During her first assignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nickname " Fearless . " She was n't sure if it was appropriate . Patel had always associated " fearless " with " heroic , " and she certainly never felt heroic . She just was almost always , in any situation , more curious than afraid . The universe was full of scientific wonders and marvels , and her brain automatically snapped into that mode rather than get me out of here . This planet , actually , was rather boring from a scientific viewpoint . She 'd spent her free time on the trip here analyzing the data Marius Fortier and the other colonists had collected , and it was pretty standard Class-M stuff . While as always there were interesting variations on things , such as a new strain of orchid or arachnid , there was nothing startling or amazing or wondrous . Still , she had her tricorder out and was analyzing it intently . Who knew but that something exciting and unusual might register and she would be the one to  - -  Patel took a swift breath and her eyes widened as she stared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading right for her . This was such a beautiful planet , Lieutenant Harry Kim thought as he strode toward the center of the colony , which had been designated as the rendezvous point . No wonder Fortier and the others wanted to return . He wondered if they would indeed still want to resume colonization of the place , now that they knew there were no survivors among the colonists who had chosen to stay behind . He wished that had n't been the case , and hoped at least that they would able to find the colonists ' bodies and give them a proper burial . He crested a slight ridge and looked down at the group of buildings nestled in the valley . What was the word he was looking for ? Pastoral ? Bucolic ? Either would do . It was n't quite a rustic farmland of the eighteenth century or anything like that  --  Fortier and his friends certainly did n't eschew the benefits of technology  --  but the little town that lay before him had an aura of simplicity about it that made him want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lakes . Kim made his way down the hill , stepping sideways now and then to avoid stumbling on grass still slick from the recent rain . He looked again at the little square and suddenly saw something that made the scene look decidedly less bucolic  --  the fallen bodies of security officers Brendan Niemann and Kathryn Kaylar . He had put away his phaser while he descended the slope . Now he pulled it out again and started running down the hill , his eyes glancing around for whoever or whatever might have done this . Kim never saw the enemy that had stalked him silently and now launched itself at him from behind . Patel had two instruments in her hands  --  her phaser and her tricorder . She thumbed a button on the latter and lifted the former , but she had underestimated the creature 's speed . It sprang on her even as she fired and her shot went wild . Her small body fell beneath the creature 's weight , and the tricorder flew from her hand . The beast weighed several hundred kilos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her arms pinned , she squirmed stubbornly beneath it , staring up at its small dark eyes and muzzle crammed with teeth . Carnivore , she thought in a detached part of her mind . She felt hot breath on her face and smelled rotting meat . Yes , definitely carnivore . Patel braced herself for the crunching of those sharp teeth on her unprotected throat , but it did n't come . She and the creature locked gazes for the span of a few heartbeats . Saliva dripped onto her cheek . Then , as suddenly as it had attacked , it was gone . Patel gasped for breath and wished she had n't as the pain redoubled . Through the agony of each inhalation , she wondered : Why did n't that thing kill me ? " Sekky , are you all right ? " Oh , good , thought Ellis . They 're awake . That should make this more fun . He looked over at his companion , grinned , and inclined his head in the direction of the lab . His companion nodded and stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , timing the moment . " What happened ? " Sekaya still sounded groggy . " An excellent question , and one we 'll be happy to answer . " Ellis smiled at Sekaya 's gasp as she recognized the Cardassian . He wanted to see her reaction himself but knew that the moment would be sweeter if he prolonged it . " You ! You son of a bitch ! " Ellis raised an eyebrow in surprise . Do you kiss your brother with that mouth ? he thought , amused . He began to make his own way down the corridor , moving quietly while Crell Moset spoke . " Hello , Sekaya . I 'm flattered that you recognized me . I must have made quite an impression . No , no , dear , do n't struggle , you 'll hurt yourself and I 'll have to sedate you . " Now . " And that just would n't be any fun at all , would it , Chakotay ? " Ellis said , stepping inside . He could n't help grinning as he saw Chakotay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real Andrew Ellis , stuck in a stasis chamber . " It would n't be any fun at all . " And this was the moment he had been waiting for , the moment when Chakotay , after so many years , would finally understand . He let his features shift , blur , rearrange themselves into a face Chakotay had known well , so long ago . " Arak Katal , " breathed Chakotay . The shape-shifter who wore the face of a Bajoran freedom fighter shrugged . Its earring danced with the movement . " Among others , " he said . " Suddenly it all makes perfect sense , " said Chakotay . " I never could figure out why a Bajoran would want to betray the Maquis . " " That 's been bothering you for a while , I know , " said Katal/Ellis . " Glad I could solve that little mystery . But I did n't bring you down here just to reminisce . I 've been looking for you for quite some time , Chakotay . " With each second that passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been Katal who had sent him on his last mission as a Maquis  --  the mission that had forced him to hide in the Badlands , where his ship had been snatched by the Caretaker . Chakotay had operated from Tevlik 's moon . As he had told Admiral Janeway , had he not headed for the Badlands in an attempt to evade the clutches of Gul Evek , he knew that he would have died at the massacre along with so many others . Being lost in the Delta Quadrant had probably saved his life . " You sent me away , " he said to the shape-shifter . " Into the Badlands . Did you know about the Caretaker somehow ? " " Of course not , " Katal responded . " That would have defeated the whole point . I just wanted you captured , Chakotay . Not dead , not abducted by some super-being and whisked seventy thousand light-years away  --  just safely captured by a Cardassian Gul . " Without appearing to , Chakotay subtly tested the restraints . They were solid . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of his eye he saw her staring , wide-eyed , totally in shock at what she beheld . Stay quiet , Sekky , he thought . Let me handle this . " Safely captured by a Cardassian , " he repeated , " and then turned over to the tender ministrations of one Dr. Crell Moset . " Better known as the Butcher of Bajor , he thought . " Exactly , " said Moset . " I understand that you are what your people call a contrary . That made this quite difficult for me . Did you know that you were the only inhabitant of Dorvan V who ever left the planet ? And I 'm a completist . " " Sorry to have inconvenienced you , " Chakotay said sarcastically . He was beginning to understand what was going on . For whatever reason , Crell Moset wanted to take samples from Chakotay , to finish his analysis of the colonists of Dorvan V. What kind of sick mind would obsess about something so trivial when his people had been so thoroughly defeated ? And why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bizarre , and disturbing . Chakotay had no doubt but that if he and Sekaya could n't manage to escape , they would be joining Blue Water Dreamer much sooner than either of them wanted . " Just what is it you 're trying to complete ? " he asked , stalling for time . " You may not know this , Moset , but our Doctor on Voyager created a holographic version of you . Your expertise saved a crewman 's life . A friend 's life . " Moset managed to look both pleased and offended when he replied , " I am indeed aware of that , Captain . And I 'm aware that despite my expertise , your doctor chose to delete my program permanently . Think of the lives I  --  excuse me , my hologram  --  could have saved ! Think of the knowledge we would have gained ! Wandering in the Delta Quadrant for seven years , all that new information  --  " Chakotay kept his gaze on the Cardassian , but out of the corner of his eye he tried to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruments , the tools , the type of rock that surrounded it , anything that could be used as a weapon . And of course he watched Katal  --  damn it  --  the shape-shifter . Probably a Changeling , given his easy way with the Cardassian . Who was looking at him with an odd expression on his face at this very moment . " He 's playing you , Moset , " the Changeling drawled . Chakotay 's skin prickled and he felt a wave of anger and hatred wash over him at the sound of that familiar voice . The voice that he had thought belonged to a friend ; the voice that had spoken lies that sounded so much like truths no one ever suspected what was really going on . " Nonsense , " said Moset , but he looked a little subdued . " Come , my friend , " the Changeling said , taking Moset by the arm and steering him away . " We have much to discuss . " They stepped down the corridor , speaking in low tones . Chakotay could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't his primary concern . " Sekaya , " he hissed , " are you all right ? " She did n't answer at once . Then she turned her head slowly on the bed to look at him . Her beautiful eyes were wet . " He found us , Chakotay , " she said , and her normally melodious voice was thick . " Great Spirit , he found us . I thought I 'd left him behind . I thought he 'd taken enough from me . First Blue Water Dreamer and then Father ... and now he 's going to murder us , too . " " No , he 's not , " said Chakotay . Yet even as he uttered the words , he looked around at their surroundings with dwindling hope , and wondered if he would prove to be as much a liar as Arak Katal . Continues ...
