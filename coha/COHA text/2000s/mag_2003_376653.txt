Jimmy Carter has always been proud of his breadth of achievement : nuclear engineer , farmer , U.S. President , humanitarian and 2002 Nobel Peace Prize winner . Now , with The Hornet 's Nest , his novel about the Revolutionary War , he has turned to fiction . The reviews were gently tough , but speaking with TIME 's Massimo Calabresi , Carter showed that , as always , he 's ready for a fight . <P> WHY WRITE A NOVEL AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE YOU 'VE TACKLED ? I wanted to tell a kind of ignored story about the most important war in which America 's ever been involved . And I wanted to do it in a highly personal way so that I could describe the torture that went on within the hearts and minds of 25% of the inhabitants of America  --  all British citizens  --  who finally made a decision to break away from the King of England . Also , it was kind of a challenge to me . I was ready to try something new . <P> IN THE BOOK , SOME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , KILLING CIVILIANS . IS THERE A HIDDEN MESSAGE HERE ? I think it shows that maybe people who wo n't eat French fries should remember that we would never have won our independence without French support . I think it shows that the international interrelationships are much superior to a unilateral action . <P> DO YOU THINK THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS HELPED OR HURT THE ARAB-ISRAELI PEACE PROCESS ? They 've hurt it . This Administration has abandoned what has been in the past a bipartisan commitment to a relatively balanced position in trying to find peace . It 's been an ostentatious alliance between the White House and the Sharon government , I think to the detriment of our nation 's image and to the detriment of an eventual peace agreement . <P> SADDAM WAS A TERRIBLE TYRANT . DO YOU THINK , IN HINDSIGHT , REMOVING HIM WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO ? Not unilaterally , with a few British troops tagging along . I think it would have been very good to remove him once and for all with an international force , as was envisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWARD APPEASEMENT . WHAT 'S YOUR DEFENSE ? I do n't feel defensive . The Carter Center has the policy of promoting peace , justice , freedom , human rights and the alleviation of suffering all over the world . And quite often , as is predictable , a serious war or human-rights oppression is the fault of an unsavory character . To get to the heart of those issues , our policy has been to try to negotiate a settlement . <P> OTHERS SAY YOUR POST-PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN YOUR PRESIDENCY . IS THAT FAIR ? The people who say that are the ones who never found anything right with my presidency . We kept the peace , we kept our country safe , we promoted human rights around the world , we normalized relations with China , we had nuclear agreements with the Soviet Union , we brought peace to Israel and Egypt . I feel comfortable about my Administration . But I have really enjoyed the life after the White House . <P> THE DEAN CAMPAIGN EVOKES SOME MEMORIES OF YOUR CANDIDACY IN ' 76 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be doing quite well . He came down to Georgia when he was just planning the campaign and talked to me and my wife about the basic tactics of ' 76 . On occasion , he has called me to give me a report on his campaign or to ask a question .
