I AM LYING on my back on the grass . Thoby is lying next to me , his warm flank pressing into my side . My eyes are open and I am watching the clouds , tracing giants , castles , fabulous winged beasts as they chase each other across the sky . Something light tickles my cheek . I raise myself onto my elbow and catch hold of the grass stalk in Thoby 's hand . He jerks away from me , and soon we are pummeling and giggling until I scarcely know which of the tumbling legs and arms are Thoby 's and which are mine . When we stop at last , Thoby 's face is on my chest . I feel the weight of his head against my ribs . His hair is golden in the sunlight and as I look up I see the blazing whiteness of an angel . I loop my arm round Thoby 's neck . For the first time in my life I know what bliss means . <p> A shadow falls . My angel disappears . I recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I push you away you jump up and whisper in Thoby 's ear . He lifts his head and looks at you . I see from his expression that your words have captured him . I know that you will lure him away with one of your daredevil plans . I roll over and press my face into the grass . The blades prickle my eyelids and I concentrate on the sharpness . When I turn round again the two of you have gone . I sit up and spot Thoby perching precariously on top of the garden wall . His hand clutches at the branches overhead as he tries to steady himself . I hear him shrieking with daring and fear . I want to shout to him to come and play in the grass with me . Then I watch you catch hold of Thoby 's leg and pull yourself up beside him . You wobble for a moment before you find your balance . I know that now you will turn and wave to me in triumph . I lie back on the grass , feigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my tears . <p> I lift my head from the page and look out the window . Sunlight shivers on the glass . For a moment I see your face as it was then , impish , grinning at me as I write . The light dissolves and you disappear . I am left staring at the empty pane . My memories are as tangled as the reels of thread and fragments of cloth in Mother 's sewing basket , which I loved to tip out and sort on the nursery floor : colored ribbons , stray buttons , a triangle of purple lace . <p> Mother . She enters the nursery like a queen . We , her troops , present ourselves for her inspection , fidgeting as we wait in line for our turn . Her hair is parted in the middle and tied at the back of her neck in a net . She wears a black dress , which rustles like leaves as she moves about the room , gathering up the damp clothes that have been draped over the fireguard , sweeping the scattered pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers dance as she talks to the nursemaids . I learn the questions she asks them by heart . Later I will set out my dolls and quiz them in her clear round voice about castor oil and the mending . I practice standing with my head erect and my back straight until my shoulders feel as if they are pinned in a press . Finally , Mother seats herself in the chair by the fire and calls us to her . <p> Always , Thoby goes first . I watch him pulled into the curve of Mother 's arm , closing my eyes to imagine the silky feel of her dress , her smell of lavender and eau de nil . When I open my eyes her fingers are stroking his hair . I do not question why it is always Thoby who is first , or why , when Adrian is born , he takes his place after Thoby . I sense that this is the order of things and that here my wishes count for little . Yet when Thoby is relinquished with a kiss and Mother holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise has been broken . My stomach clenches and a hot spurt of indignation surges to my cheeks . I am the eldest . I should come before you . As Mother lifts you onto her knee your dimpled hands reach for the ribbon she wears at her throat . Checked by her reproving frown , you lean forward and kiss her . Her smile is like sunshine on a winter 's afternoon . You seem to spend an eternity in her arms . Your palms clap together in a rhyme of pat-a-cake , and when Mother praises you I wonder what would happen if a spark from the fire were to catch your petticoat . I picture your clothes igniting and your red hair blazing and Mother in her alarm hugging me to her breast . <p> There is a knock on the door . Ellen , slightly breathless from the stairs , holds out a card on a tray . Mother sighs and reaches for the card . When she has finished reading it she puts it back on the tray and tells Ellen that she will come straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final instruction to the nursemaids follows Ellen onto the landing . <p> I stare after her . You crawl toward me and your hand reaches for the buckle on my shoe . Quick as lightning , I kick back with my heel and trap your fingers under the sole . Your howl voices what I feel . I count to five before I lift my foot . Then I reach down and pick you up and carry you to the chair Mother sat in . I settle you on my lap and rock you backward and forward until the soft lullaby of your breathing tells me you are asleep . <p> It is my half sister Stella who first puts a piece of chalk in my hand . She and I share a birthday . I rummage in her pocket and pull out the package I know is there . It is wrapped in brown paper that crinkles as I turn it over in my hands . Inside are six stubby colored fingers . Stella takes a board she has concealed under her arm and draws on it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to try the chalk for myself . I spend the morning absorbed in my new pursuit . Though my hands are clumsy , I persevere until the board is covered . I am fascinated by the way my marks cross and join with each other , opening tiny triangles , diamonds , rectangles between the lines . When I have finished I sit back and stare at my achievement . I have transformed the dull black of the board into a rainbow of colors , a hail of shapes that jump about as I look . I am so pleased with what I have done that I hide the board away . I do not want to share my discovery with anyone . <p> We are in the hall dressed and ready for our walk . At our request Ellen lifts us onto the chair by the mirror so that we can see the reflections we make . Our faces are inexact replicas of each other , as if the painter were trying to capture the same person from different angles . Your face is prettier than mine , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are my natural ally in my dealings with the world . I adore the way you watch me accomplish the things you can not yet achieve . I do not yet see the frustration , the desire to catch up and topple me that darkens your awe . <p> " Who do you like best , Mother or Father ? " Your question comes like a bolt out of the blue . I hold the jug of warm water suspended in midair and look at you . You are kneeling on the bathmat , shiny-skinned and rosy from the steam . The ends of your hair are wet and you have a towel draped round your shoulders . I am dazzled by the audacity of your question . Slowly I let the water from the jug pour into the bath . <p> " Mother . " I lean back into the warmth . <p> You consider my answer , squeezing the damp from your hair . <p> " I prefer Father . " <p> " Father ? " I sit up quickly . " How can you possibly like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " At least he 's not vague . " You spin round and look at me directly . I sense that you are enjoying this discussion . <p> " But Mother is ... " I search for my word . I think of the arch of her neck as she walks into a room , the way the atmosphere changes as she seats herself at table . <p> " Is what ? " Your eyes are daring me now . <p> " Beautiful . " I say the word quietly . <p> " What does that count for ? " You do nothing to hide your contempt . " Mother does n't know as much as Father , she does n't read as much . At least when Father settles on something you know he is n't going to be called away . " <p> I want to rally , hit back , protest how self-centered Father is . I want to declare Mother 's goodness , proclaim her unstinting sense of duty , her ability to restore order when all is in disarray . Instead I stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eye I can see that you are smiling . <p> " Well at least we need n't fight about who we like . " Sure of your victory , your tone now is conciliatory . I get out of the bath and wrap myself in a towel . As so often happens , our argument has made me miserable . I press my forehead against the glass of the window and watch the branches of the trees make crisscross patterns against the sky . I do not like this sifting through our feelings , weighing Mother 's merits and Father 's faults as if the answer to our lives were a simple question of arithmetic . Not for the first time , I find myself fearing where your cleverness will lead . <p> I want to convey the aura of those days . Father 's controlling presence , the sound of his pacing in the study above us , his clamorous , insistent groans . Mother sitting writing at her desk , preoccupied , elusive . I visualize the scene as if it were a painting . The colors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - with flashes of crimson from the fire . At the top of the picture are flecks of silver sky . The children kneel in the foreground . Mother , Father , our half brothers George and Gerald stand in a ring behind us , their figures monumental and restraining . Though our faces are indistinct it is possible to make out our outlines . Thoby 's arm reaches across mine , in search of a toy , perhaps , a cotton reel or wooden train . Laura hides behind Thoby , Stella 's arm curled round her in a sheltering arc . Adrian , still a baby , lies asleep in his crib . You are in the center of the picture . You seem to be painted in a different palette . Your hair is threaded with the red of the fire , your dress streaked with silver from the sky . You leap out from the monotone gloom of the rest . I can not tell if this prominence has been forced on you , or if it is something you have sought for yourself . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startles me from my reverie and I struggle to focus on what she is telling us . She is teaching us history . Her back is as straight as a rod and her hands are folded demurely in her lap . This , too , is part of our lesson . She wishes us to learn that we must be controlled and attentive at all times . My mind skates over the list of names she is reading aloud to us . There is a picture of a crown at the top of her page and without meaning to I lose myself in its delicate crenelations . <p> " Vanessa ! This is the second time of telling ! You will please stand up and recite the kings and queens of England in order and without error ! " I jump out of my chair . Your eyes are fixed on me and I sense you willing me to remember . I stammer the names of William and Henry and Stephen then grind to a stop . Before Mother can scold , you come to my rescue . <p> " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mother , who nods . <p> " Is it true Elizabeth the First was the greatest queen England has ever known ? Was she truly - a superlative monarch ? " Mother smiles at your eloquence and I slink back into my chair , dejected as well as relieved . You have your permission to proceed and your eyes shine in triumph . I know that nothing will stop you now . <p> " Do you suppose it was because she was a woman that she achieved so much ? I mean , it 's true , is n't it , that she never married ? I suppose there was n't a king who was good enough for her . If she had married she would have been busy having-children and so would n't have had time for her affairs of state . The people called her ' Gloriana ' and she had her own motto . " <p> " ' Semper eadem ' ! " Father stands in the doorway , applauding your performance . He has the book from which he is teaching us mathematics under his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motto she had inscribed on her tomb . So it 's Elizabeth the First , is it ? The Virgin Queen . In that case , perhaps you had better come with me and we will see what we can find for you in my library . " You slip from your chair and take the hand Father holds out to you . I see the skip in your walk as you accompany him out of the room . The door closes behind you and I turn my attention back to Mother . I try not to hear her sigh as she begins to reread the list of names . <p> I thumb the pages of the family photograph album and stop at a portrait of Laura , Father 's daughter by his first marriage . She is nine , ten , perhaps , and her ringleted hair cascades over her shoulders . Her face is turned away from the camera and she clasps a small doll in her arms . It is impossible to tell her expression . <p> You never ridiculed Laura , I remember . Once when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his food in the fire you were so angry you slapped him . He turned to you in disbelief but the indignation on your face was real . <p> The day Laura was sent away you stayed in our room . It was one of your " curse " days , and when I went to see if you wanted anything I found you lying with your face buried in your pillow . As I tiptoed toward your bed you turned to look at me . <p> " Have they sent her to a madhouse ? " I did not know the answer any more than you but shook my head . <p> " How could they ? " I saw then the anguish in your eyes . As I put my arm around you it was my fear as well as yours I was shielding . <p> We lie in our beds watching the darkness . Though we plead for a crack to be left in the curtains they are pulled tight against the certainty of drafts . I close my eyes to conjure the moonlight and listen for Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we have helped her dress . I fastened her pearl necklace carefully round her neck and she promised to come and kiss us goodnight . I imagine her sitting at the table , handing round the plates of soup . If the dinner is a success she will tell us about her labors . She will describe the fidgety young man who must be coaxed into the conversation , and the woman whose talk of ailments has to be curtailed to avert alarm . She will tell us these things not for our amusement but because she wants us to benefit from the example . We must learn , she will remind us with a judicious nod of her head , that the hostess can not leave her place at table until those around her are at their ease . Her own wishes , and those of her daughters , must be placed second to the needs of others . <p> The darkness is so intense it seems to be alive . I think of the silver candelabra , drawing those seated round the table into a circle of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Mother ? " I whisper . <p> Your hand is on my arm . I have forgotten you in my musings . I pull back the bedclothes and make room for you . We lie shoulder to shoulder , comforted by each other 's presence . You clear your throat and begin . <p> " Mrs. Dilke , " you say in your storytelling voice , " was most surprised one morning to discover that the family had run out of eggs . " I settle back on my pillow and let your words weave their spell . Soon I have forgotten the darkness and Mother 's broken promise . I am caught up in your world of make-believe . I fall asleep dreaming of hobgoblins and golden hens and eggs fried for breakfast with plenty of frizzle . <p> " Is she reading it ? " <p> I stand by the window that allows us to see into the drawing room from the conservatory where we work . Mother is in her armchair , the latest copy of our newspaper on the table beside her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the movement of her lips that she is reading parts of it aloud to Father . He is in the armchair next to her and appears engrossed in his book . You are crouching on the floor beside me , your hands pulling nervously at a cushion . Your agitation surprises me . The newspaper is something we have compiled for fun . I peer through the window . <p> " She 's finishing her letter , folding it back into its envelope . " <p> " And has she picked up the newspaper ? " <p> I stare at Mother . She has leaned her head back against the chair rest and closed her eyes . I watch her motionless for a few moments . You pummel the cushion in desperation . I can bear your anxiety no longer . <p> " Yes , " I lie . " She 's opening it now . " <p> " Can you see what she 's reading ? Is it my piece about the pond ? Does it make her laugh ? What 's the expression on her face ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has her head resting against her chair . I watch her rouse herself , pick up the newspaper , glance at its headline , then let it fall unopened on her lap . I can not tell you what I see . <p> " She loves it , " I say . " She turned straight to your story and now she 's laughing her head off . " I pull the curtain firmly across the window and turn away . <p> You smile as if what I have told you is the most important thing in the world . <p> It is our ritual . You sit on the bathroom stool , a towel wrapped loosely round your shoulders . I choose lily of the valley and rose water from the shelf and stand behind you . I pour a little of the rose water into my palm and leave it for a moment to warm . Your shoulders are smooth under my fingers . I work my hands down your back , watching your skin undulate to my touch . You lay your head on my chest and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against your cheek . I knead the soft flesh of your arms as if it is dough . <p> " Go on , " I nudge you gently , " carry on with the story . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
