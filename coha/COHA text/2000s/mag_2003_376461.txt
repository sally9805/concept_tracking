INSIDE THE NEW SATS <P> " It 's high time we test students ' actual knowledge and not how well they have learned to respond to multiple-choice questions . " GUILLERMO HERNANDEZ Darien , Conn . <P> The New SAT is a disaster OCT. 27 . At least the old SAT tested general reasoning , but the fresh emphasis on advanced math will force schools to speed up the math progression , which will cause even more students to fall behind and become mathphobic . We should achieve our current standards before we up the ante ; if students are already stumbling , the New SAT may cause them to fall flat on their faces . ABNER MINTZ Laurel , Md . <P> Aptitude , achievement , potential and prediction are just recycled words in educational testing . The College Entrance Examination Board should n't waste money and energy worrying high school students and their parents with the New SAT . The test , in any incarnation , is simply another item for colleges to consider . The Ivies and other elite universities will continue to use an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whomever they want to achieve their ideal , perfectly diverse freshman class . Let 's stop the charade ; abolish the SAT . BILL TOUMEY Long Beach , N.Y . <P> The changes to the SAT may or may not have a positive impact on high school curriculums and on students ' preparation for success in college . What high school teachers , guidance counselors , prospective college students and their parents need to know , however , is that successful performance , both in college and life , depends on being able to apply one 's knowledge and skills to new problems  --  problems that are not scripted . Assessments of students ' learning should focus on the ability to deal with unscripted problems , not just on finding ( or guessing ) the one right answer . Standardized testing should never be the primary focus of a student 's journey to college . CAROL GEARY SCHNEIDER , PRESIDENT ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES Washington <P> John Cloud 's view of the New SAT provided a compelling account of the social politics behind high-stakes standardized testing . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles . The College Board is right to be concerned about performance gaps among different demographic groups , but making the SAT more of an achievement test than a so-called aptitude test may exacerbate the problem . Changing the test to produce socially desirable results can distract attention from a greater problem : unequal access to excellence in education . Until the nation 's schools begin providing equal education to all , affordable , effective test preparation may be students ' best shot at leveling the academic playing field . BENJAMIN PARIS DIRECTOR , TEST PREPARATION PETERSON 'S Lawrenceville , N.J. <P> I 'm a high school junior . I 've taken SAT prep courses but have a hard time remembering what I did last week . That does n't mean I do n't deserve to go to a first-rate college , just that I do n't have a good short-term memory . The SAT ought to measure one 's creativity and find out what an individual has experienced because that is what shapes a person 's life . MEGAN WOLCOTT Pittsburgh , Pa.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
