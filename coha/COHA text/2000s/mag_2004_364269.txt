Each week Sy ( estimated net worth : $1.4 billion ) , sporting his trademark Hawaiian shirt , gathers his six children at the company 's warehouse-style offices near Manila 's waterfront , where they oversee nearly every aspect of the business . On Saturdays family members fan out to conduct firsthand inspections of their SM malls , department stores and supermarkets . On Sundays Sy , 80 , insists that the family meet yet again , either at his $2 million luxury log cabin in the lush hills outside Manila or at the family home in the swish Forbes Park district of the capital .
