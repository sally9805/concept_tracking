Section : CE <p> PURPOSE : To define the state of nursing knowledge about the psychological impact of treating adolescents with external fixation devices ( EFDs ) . <p> METHOD : An integrated research review was conducted on literature available from CINAHL , MEDLINE , and PsycINFO . Keywords used were external fixation , fracture fixation , orthopaedic or orthopaedic , limb lengthening , Ilizarov , halo traction , Orthofix , EBI fixator , pelvic fixator , ring fixator , body image , self-concept , self-esteem , self-perception , adaptation , emotional , behavior , and outcome . Inclusion criteria for studies were ( a ) publication from 1990 to 2003 , ( b ) focus on psychosocial and functional outcomes of treating adolescents with EFDs , and ( c ) publication in English . Studies were categorized by author , year , discipline(s) , design , focus , sample , measurement , findings , and research recommendations . Findings and recommendations were compared across publications . <p> RESULTS : All studies reported psychological and behavioral changes after EFD treatment . Pain and pin-site infections were the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees , with some suicidal ideation and self-destructive behaviors , although mostly reported as transient . This predominantly retrospective cohort of studies reported social isolation as well as eating and sleep disturbances . Family and nursing support , a multiple disciplinary approach , and better preoperative preparation were crucial to adolescents ' psychological health after EFD treatment . <p> CONCLUSION : Adolescents treated with EFDs require significant psychosocial support . The findings reveal major gaps in the knowledge on adolescents treated with external fixation for traumatic injury and none focused on EFD treatment in the acute period . <p> External fixation devices ( EFDs ) are external metal frames with skeletal pins that penetrate soft tissue ( pin site ) to anchor to the bone , thus stabilizing fractured bone . Although external fixation is considered to be a rather " new " trend in orthopaedics , it has in fact been in use since the mid 1800s and reemerged in the mid 1900s with the modernization of the external fixation apparatus ( Paul , 2003 ) . Early use of EFDs with adolescents was initially limited to correction of limb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior outcomes achieved with EFD , its use has increased in the treatment of fractures in acutely injured adolescents ( Bernardo , 2001 ; Buckley , 1997 ; Gregory , Pevny , &; Teague , 1996 ; Hedin , Hjorth , Rehnberg , &; Larsson , 2003 ; Pape et al . 2002 ) . <p> Visualization of EFDs is crucial to the understanding of the potential psychosocial impact of this therapy on adolescents ( see Figures 1-3 ) . The EFD is large and unsightly and generally can not be hidden by clothing . Psychosocial issues germane to adolescents may hinder their ability to sell-manage these EFDs . To explore the psychosocial impact of EFD treatment on adolescents , this integrated review of the relevant literature was undertaken . Background and Significance Adolescence <p> Adolescence , the stage of development from childhood to adulthood , begins with the development of secondary sexual characteristics ( Steinberg &; Morris , 2000 ) . It is divided by age into early ( 9-14years ) , middle ( 15-17years ) , and late ( 18-20+ years ) adolescence but is marked more by achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2001 ; Montgomery , 2002 ; Steinberg &; Moms ) . These tasks involve both physical and psychosocial changes ( Table 1 ) . Psychosocial Development <p> The developmental challenges of adolescence are focused on four tasks : becoming independent from parents , adopting peer codes , accepting body image , and establishing an identity ( Radzik , Sherer , &; Neinstein , 2002 ) . <p> The task of developing independence from parents begins in early adolescence , with peak conflict around middle adolescence ( Radzik et al. , 2002 ) . These conflicts may result in limit testing and rebellion or withdrawn behavior ( Busen , 2001 ; Steinberg &; Morris , 2000 ) . Adolescents in later stages develop an increased ability to compromise and once again accept parental values and advice ( Radzik et al . ) . Middle and late adolescence often marks the beginning of driving and work , with new freedoms and responsibilities . <p> Body image and pubertal changes preoccupy early adolescents . Many are disproportionately concerned about how they appear to peers or to an imaginary audience , often resulting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2000 ) . Middle adolescents begin to accept their body changes and focus on becoming more attractive , and some begin sexual experimentation at this stage ( Radzik et al. , 2002 ) . <p> Socially , early adolescents develop strong same sex relationships and become intensely involved with their peers ( Radzik et al. , 2002 ; Steinberg &; Morris , 2000 ) . Their need for privacy is high ( Dashiff , 2001 ) . The importance of interacting with peer 's peaks at middle adolescence , as demonstrated by striving for conformity in clothing , language , and values , and frequently gathering in clubs , sports , or gangs ( Radzik et al. ; Steinberg &; Morris ) . At this stage , adolescents value group over family identity ( Busen , 2001 ) . Older adolescents become less concerned with peers as they form intimate dyadic relationships ( Steinberg &; Morris ) . <p> In their struggle to define their identity , early and middle adolescents experience phases of fantasy , idealism , omnipotence , and risk taking , some with little impulse control ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think abstractly and can follow instructions and understand concepts and consequences . However , rapid growth of the prefrontal cortex ( responsible for judgment and impulse control ) and problems with synaptic connections are believed to facilitate a tendency to primitive limbic system responses ( emotional or gut reactions ) ( Strauch , 2003 ) . Older adolescents work toward forming an identity or role in society and may begin educational or other preparation for this goal ( Radzik et al . ) . Treatment with an EFD at any stage of these stages may impact the adolescent . External Fixation <p> External fixation is a general term used for an orthopaedic device made of metal with two essential components : skeletal pins and a frame worn outside the body . Threaded pins , placed through small incisions in the skin and soft tissue , are secured in the cortical bone via drilled grooves ( see Figure 1 ) . Another fixation method is by using transfixion pins , whereby a pin goes directly through soft tissue into the bone and comes out from the opposite side of both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elective and traumalic conditions . Elective External Fixation Device Use <p> Elective use of EFDs as a legitimate form of treatment emerged with the work of Dr. Gavriel Ilizarov , a Russian orthopaedist , considered to be the lather of external fixation , who designed a method to lengthen limbs of children with achondroplasia ( dwarfism ) . This method uses a cluster of layered metal rings , rods , wires , and pins . These devices are placed on intact bone and a corticomy is performed ( complete circumferential cutting of the bone cortex ) . The body goes about the business of healing the bone by sending out osteoblasts ( bone building cells ) from the " injured " bone ends . Seven days after the corticomy , the frame is slowly manipulated by turning nuts ( on threaded rods on the external frame ) a 1/4 turn every 6 hours daily to transport bone to a new location or angle over several weeks or months . The object is to keep the bone ends pulling apart microscopically , so healing does not occur and more osteoblasls are laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow , tedious process . Because it takes about 1 month for every inch to be corrected , the process can last for weeks to months , depending on the length of growth or angle of correction desired ( American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons , 2001 ) . When the desired length or angular correction is reached , turning is stopped . The frame remains on until the hone solidifies and can bear weight without the support of the frame ( see Figure 4 ) . External fixation devices are frequently applied during early adolescence to correct long bone deformities , such as Blount 's disease ( see Figures 2 and 3 ) . The success of the Ilizarov fixator in treating complicated skeletal and soft tissue deformities and limb length inequalities has led to its expanded use worldwide to treat traumatic fractures . External Fixation Device Use in Trauma <p> Fractures in children and adolescents may be treated with EFDs for various reasons . Open physes ( growth plates ) may limit orthopaedic treatment options . If a physis is crossed with a surgical implant , bone growth may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &; Heckman , 1996 ) . External fixation devices stabilize bone while avoiding physes and allowing access to wounds , skin grafts , and muscle flaps ( see Figure 5 ) . <p> External fixation devices allow joint motion above or below a fracture and act as portable traction , promoting callus development and early healing to facilitate patient mobility and early discharge from the hospital . Frame design and pin placement are versatile and depend on the fracture configuration or correction requirements . Some adolescents treated with EFDs return to activities , including school , within days of application of the device ( see Figure 6 ) . Removal of EFDs requires little or no need for anesthetic , and only small scars remain after removal ( Bernardo. 2001 ; Hedin el al. , 2003 ; Miner &; Carroll , 2000 ; Sanly , 2000 ) . Methods Integrated Research Review <p> The state of knowledge on the psychological impact of treating adolescents with EFDs was examined by an integrative research review , which reviewed the pertinent literature according to rigorous guidelines ( Ganong , 1987 ; Jackson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which individual studies comprise the study sample . Information from studies in the sample were systematically categorized employing a data collection tool that structured data extraction on demographics of the sample , research design employed , variables measured with accompanying instruments , major findings , and research recommendations thereby facilitating comparison across studies ( Sparbel &; Anderson , 2000 ) . Sample Criteria and Search <p> To be included in this integrative research review , studies had to meet the following criteria : ( a ) publication from 1990 to 2003 , ( b ) focus on psychosocial and functional outcomes of treating adolescents with EFDs , and ( c ) publication in English . The literature available through the CFNAHL , Medline , and PsycINFO computerized databases was searched using the key terms external fixation , fracture fixation , orthopedic or orthopaedic , limb lengthening , Ilizarov , halo traction , Orthofix , EBI ( Electro-Biology , Inc. ) fixator , pelvic fixator , ring fixator , body image , self-concept , self-esteem , self-perception , adaptation , emotional , behavior , and outcome . Findings Sample Characteristics <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) . Of these , two studies targeted adolescents only , five targeted children and adolescents , and two targeted adults and adolescents ; the age range of participants was 3-83 years . Of the six studies that reported gender , five had more male than female subjects . Ethnicity was not reported in any article . Study Design <p> Many ( four of nine ) studies in the sample used a retrospective design ( Hrutkay &; Eilert , 1990 ; Lavini , Renzi-Brivio , &; de Bastiani , 1990 ; Olson , Uslanko , &; Warner , 1991 ; Paley , 1990 ) . All studies used convenience samples , with sample sizes ranging from 15 to 80 . Level of Scientific Merit <p> The majority ( six of nine ) of studies used chart review , questionnaires , or interviews to gather information about reactions to external fixators . Two studies reported psychological findings anecdotally in descriptive , retrospective , and unstructured studies ( Lavini et al. , 1990 ; Paley , 1990 ) . <p> Olson et al . ( 1991 ) used an investigator-developed questionnaire with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being treated with a halo vest . Relevancy of questions ( validity ) was determined by experts on the care of patients in halos . Open-ended questions solicited ideas to improve care for friture patients . <p> Three studies on patients who had Ilizarov lengthening procedures used psychometric measures to examine care and functional response after surgical intervention ( Ghoneem , Wright , Cole , &; Rang , 1996 ; Martin , Farrell , Lambrenos , &; Nayagam , 2003 ; Ramaker , Lagro , van Roermund , &; Sinnema , 2000 ) . Ghoneem et al . used the Post-Hospital Behavior Questionnaire , Kovac 's Children 's Depression Inventory , and the physical function subscale of the Children Health Information Service Rand Scale . The Post-Hospital Behavior Questionnaire measures parents ' report of their children 's behavior disturbance after hospilalization . Although the original reliability and validity for the Post-Hospital Behavior Questionnaire was appropriate ( Ghoneem et al. ) , the reliability of study data when correlated with an independent psychiatric interview was relatively low ( r = 0.47 ) . Kovac 's Children 's Depression Inventory was described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the child 's feelings and ideas . No other background was given for this tool . The Children Health Information Service Rand Scale contains items regarding mobility , physical activity , role activity , and self-care activity assessment . No reliability or validity was reported , but the tool appears to have faced validity . <p> Ramaker el al . ( 2000 ) used three instruments : a validated Dutch Self-report Inventory for Children , the Zung Depression Scale for adolescents , and a Dutch version of the Spielberg Test for State and Trait Anxiety . Parent and child answered questions in their home , on average 16-67 months after EFD treatment . No reliability or validity data were presented . <p> In the mixed-methods study by Martin et al . ( 2003 ) , the Offer Body Image Scale , Kovac 's Children 's Depression Inventory , and Kidscope ( a coping scale ) were administered and participants were interviewed . Validity was not established by the researcher , but rather simply stated as " established by previous research . " These psychometric tests were for comparative purposes only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Martin et al . ) . Study Outcomes <p> Adolescents ' psychological , social , functional , and physiological reactions to elective limb corrective/lengthening procedures with EFD treatment were compared through each of the nine research studies ( Table 3 ) . As there was no consistent measurement approach , the presence or absence of key variables will be noted . Psychological Impact <p> Depression was by far the most pronounced psychological effect of EFD treatment in every study , to the point of suicidal ideation or attempts for some participants ( Ghoneem et al , 1996 ; Hrulkay &; Eilert. 1990 ) . Although depression was temporary for most participants ( Ghoneem et al. ; Lavini et al. , 1990 ) , it persisted in some cases even after the removal of the EFD ( Martin et al. , 2003 ; Ramaker et al. , 2000 ) . Many adolescents exhibited anorexia or appetite changes ( Hrutkay &; Eilert ; Paley , 1990 ; Ramaker et al . ) . Emotional difficulties such as guilt , anxiety , and anger surfaced throughout several studies ( Ghoneem et al. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1991 ; Ramaker et al. ) , and self-destructive behavior was expressed in one study as intentionally contaminating pin sites of the EFD ( Hrutkay &; Eilert ) . Fear was noted , especially at night , for many adolescents during the lengthening phase , with a gradual reduction in frequency for most . However , for some , this fear persisted following treatment ( Hrutkay &; Eilert ) . <p> Body image was a significant problem for more than hall of the subjects in two studies ( Martin et al. , 2003 ; Olson et al. , 1991 ) , and this concern remained for many even after the removal of the EFD . Martin et al . give an example of one boy feeling a bit sick at waking up to see all the pins in his leg . Olson et al . reported that feelings of mutilation from the forehead scars , lumps , and indentation were expressed by many of the 25 patients treated in a halo EFD , 2 of whom sought plastic surgery . When asked about satisfaction with EFD treatment , 45% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 6-12years ) reported that scars and duration of treatment would be a significant deterrent ( p = 0.01 ) to repeat EFD treatment ( Ghoneem et al. , 1996 ) . These results are in contrast to that of Hrutkay and Eilert ( 1990 ) who found that 68% of participants would " do it again . " In the Lubrick and Anderson ( 1992 ) study reported by Eckhouse-Ekeberg ( 1994 ) , only 17% showed a " good " adjustment prior to instituting an interdisciplinary team approach that included psychological support . In contrast , 88% of 6- to 17-year-olds in the Netherlands study ( Ramaker et al. , 2000 ) reported a willingness to have the procedure again . This high willingness may be due to the intensive team approach used and prescreening of participants resulting in delay of the procedure for 20% of patients for behavioral , or family treatment and teaching coping skills . Social Impact <p> Of the five studies that examined social aspects of EFD treatment , only one spoke to participants ' preoperative social concerns for the " need to be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lavini et al. , 1990 ) . These patients were treated with limb lengthening for dwarfism . As would be expected , adolescents treated with these devices disliked stares and negative reactions of public and peers ( Olson et al. , 1991 ; Ramaker et al. , 2000 ) . Four studies noted a decrease in social contacts or plans for up to one-third of adolescents during the treatment and for some even after the EFD was removed ( Lavini et al. ; Martin et al. , 2003 ; Olson et al. ; Ramaker et al . ) . Lavini et al . noted increased social contacts and improved relations with the opposite sex after the removal of the EFD . The qualitative ( interview ) findings of Martin et al . discovered more about the importance of peers for social support for adolescents treated with EFDs than was revealed with the psychometric tests in her study . <p> Behavior disturbance was expressed in one study as noncompliance with hospital ward rules and confrontations with nurses ( Hrutkay &; Eilert , 1990 ) . Many parents faced interruptions or changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical regimes and EFD care of a child undergoing the stresses of limb lengthening ( Hrutkay &; Eilert ) . For those treated in halo EFDs , the apparatus interfered with school or work ( Olson et al. , 1991 ) . Functional Aspects <p> Physical function was affected by the EFD treatment in multiple ways in each of the nine studies . Preoperative limitation of physical function was the reason for the limb correction/lengthening procedure , for example to improve ability to walk , to drive ( a problem for patients with achondroplasia ) , or to participate in gym activities ( Lavini et al. , 1990 ; Paley , 1990 ; Ramaker et al. , 2000 ) . Sleep disturbance was the most prominent postoperative functional effect , which was related to pain and fear ( Paley ; Ramaker et al . ) . Decreased attention span and poor school work were the cognitive functional problems reported ( Olson et al. , 1991 ; Ramaker et al . ) . <p> Dependence on others for care was a substantial issue for adolescents treated with EFDs . Conflicts with nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fixator 's location , as well as emergence of regressive behaviors , even when teens were able to perform self-care ( Hrutkay &; Eilert , 1990 ; Martin et al. , 2003 ; Olson et al. , 1991 ; Ramaker et al. , 2000 ) . Physical adaptation to the bulk of the EFD frame itself was the cause for frustration in some ( Ramaker et al. ) , but adaptation was seen within the first month ( Martin et al . ) . Physiological Aspects <p> Complications as a result of the EFD procedure were muscle contractures , joint stiffness and luxation ( slipping of a joint ) , neurologic and vascular injuries , and reflex sympathetic dystrophy as well as refracture ( Ghoneem el al. , 1996 ; Lavini et al. , 1990 ; Paley , 1990 ) . <p> Conflicting findings were reported after the EFD treatment . Two studies ( Hrutkay &; Eilert , 1990 ; Martin et al. , 2003 ) reported improved function and cosmesis or appearance , whereas two others ( Lavini et al. , 1990 ; Ramaker et al. , 2000 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inability to perform regular physical gym activity . <p> The two predominant physiological problems noted in every study were pain and pin-site infection . Most described some pain " at all times " and at its worse immediately postoperatively and during the lengthening phase . Some authors recommended codeine for treatment of pain ( Ghoneem et al. , 1996 ; Paley , 1990 ) , and Paley reported that no patients developed addiction . <p> Pin-site infection was listed as a complication or problem in eight of nine studies , even though they did not focus on this issue . Treatment for this now includes oral or intravenous antibiotics . However , Paley ( 1990 ) described daily injections of antibiotic peppered around the infected pin site for a week , which is an admittedly painful treatment . Only one study offered a causal relation of pin-site infection to an adolescent contaminating his or her own pins in a self-destructive manner ( Hrutkay &; Eilert , 1990 ) . Research Recommendations <p> Many studies recommended prospective research , using larger samples , asking direct questions ( Eckhouse-Ekeberg , 1994 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 ; Martin et al. , 2003 ; Olson et al. , 1991 ) . and using better methods for collecting and scoring psychosocial and functional outcomes ( Ghoneem et al. ; Martin et al . ) . The need for studies on family and peer reactions and support to adolescents coping with EFD was also emphasized ( Martin el al. ; Olson el al . ) . Discussion <p> Although all nine studies in the sample focused on the impact of EFD treatment on adolescents and children , none specifically addressed developmental levels and differences attributed to these . Scientific merit was dilute because many studies were retrospective , not designed specifically for the purpose of identifying psychosocial impact , and relied on documentation and late **25;2127;TOOLONG . <p> When the studies are pooled together , they demonstrate a multifaceted impact . Many studies identified the need for recognizing , in fact anticipating , psychosocial as well as physical problems ( Eckhouse-Ekeberg , 1994 ; Ghoneem et al. , 1996 ; Hrutkay &; Eilert , 1990 ; Olson el al. , 1991 ; Ramaker et al. , 2000 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various issues throughout the several month course of treatment . Better preoperative preparation was recommended in five of the nine studies . Comprehensive preoperative preparation could take place only in the population undergoing the EFD treatment for nontraumatic , elective procedures . <p> Martin et al . ( 2003 ) look this concept one step further by recommending the preoperative preparation that includes the development of interventions to promote problem-solving , coping , and sell-management skills . This same approach of preoperative preparation seemed to be expressed in the Ramaker et al . ( 2000 ) study , in which 20% were held back from surgery to learn coping skills . This literature suggests that treatment with EFD is complex and stressful for the adolescent . The results support the need for formal and multidiscipline preoperative teaching and helping these young people learn coping and self-management skills to deal with this multifaceted experience . <p> The issue of depression seen in most studies is a concern . It may be more prevalent in these studies than in the general population due lo the orthopaedic condition that needed treatment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trauma patients in their samples and the lack of interviews during the acute phase of EFD treatment are the apparent gaps in the literature . Martin et al . ( 2003 ) believe that the acute phase of EFD treatment was the most problematic time . This coupled with the fact that adolescents who experience trauma are unable to participate in the preoperative preparation would seem an important aspect to the study of psychological impact of EFD treatment . Limitations <p> This study was limited to studies published in English between 1990 and 2003 and did not include dissertations that may have limited the information available . Only nine mostly retrospective research studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review , which limits the information available . Conclusions and Implications for Practice <p> Early recognition and anticipation of common psychosocial as well as physical problems during EFD therapy is important . A pre/postoperative team approach involving the patient , family , school nurse , and office and/or hospital-based nurse is called for in the elective surgical cases . A preoperative group meeting can be a valuable approach to information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the external fixator can be reviewed and explanations given on fixator care and signs and symptoms of infection . Examples of other adolescents ' psychosocial reactions to EFD should be given , thereby facilitating dialogue about depression , fear , and body image concerns . Similarly , a proactive approach should be used to involve physical and occupational therapists preoperatively to anticipate functional deficits that may arise from having the external fixator . Acquisition of adaptive equipment and measures of clothing to go over fixators ( velcro sewn into seams of pants legs , shirt sleeves or collars ) allows for easy donning of clothing and allows the use of " normal clothes , " important to the adolescents ' self-esteem . <p> During the hospitalisation period , the plan of care should target the effective control of pain and facilitation of normal sleep patterns , as well as patient and family support for acquiring the skills and knowledge to self-manage pin-site care and early recognition of pin-site infection . <p> During the treatment phase , teens should be assessed for any evidence of depression , continuing fear , sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the school environment may be facilitated it the school nurse meets with the teachers and the students prior to the adolescent returning to the school to show the fixator photo and answer questions . This practice seems to limit the initial reaction and stares of the schoolmates . Social acceptance can be further facilitated by assisting the adolescent to prepare for common reactions and responses to an external fixator . Role-playing with the adolescent for these reactions and responses may be helpful . <p> Little information was available on the acute period when pain and immobility are strongest . Prospective studies are needed to explore the adolescent 's experience during the acute phase of EFD treatment for both trauma and elective cases . The best approach to gaining information on which to base interventions with this population would be a comprehensive qualitative design that probed the adolescents ' experience and relationships with family and peers . Specific attention to developmental issues is recommended . ACKNOWLEDGEMENT <p> This study was completed with the support from Ruth Kirschstein National Research Service Award # 1 F-31 NR009442-01 .
