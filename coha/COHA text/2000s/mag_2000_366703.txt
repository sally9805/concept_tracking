Some people melt over wafer-thin notebook PCs . Others get finger twitches thinking about their next death match in Quake III . But what really brings out the techno-geek in me is a killer search engine that finds just what I 'm looking for , and fast . That 's why Google has made it to the top of my bookmark file . The engine was developed by two Stanford Ph.D . students and named after the mathematical term googol , which stands for 10100th power . The great thing about Google is that it works . <P> I had a feeling there was something different about Google when not one , not two , but three different friends recommended it to me . " It 's quick , and it gives you what you need , " said my pal Maryanne . " It does n't give you a bunch of garbage , " seconded Unmesh , who was tired of wading through irrelevant listings on other search sites . Even better , the buzz was backed up with awards from computer trades like PC Magazine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was love at first search . Unlike popular favorites Yahoo , Excite and Lycos , which have morphed into monstrous slicer-dicer portals offering everything from daily horoscopes to free e-mail , Google does only one thing  --  search  --  and does it spectacularly . Whether I 'm looking for a home remedy for sinusitis or trying to find a long-lost friend online , it has an uncanny knack for locating what I want . <P> The secret , says Sergey Brin , 26 , Google 's Russian-born co-founder , is its unique search technology . In a kind of high-tech popularity contest , Google ranks search results not by how frequently or prominently the search term appears on a given page but by how often other pages on the Web link to the page with reference to that term . As a safety measure , Google also analyzes the words around the link to make sure they 're relevant to the original query . <P> All this is invisible to users . What you will notice is that searches are quick ( according to company statistics , they take less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part to a graphics-free interface . The relatively few ads are text only and barely noticeable . Multiple results from a single site are conveniently grouped together . And you can preview the exact sentence containing your search term before clicking on the link  --  a real time-saver . <P> Brin shared a few search tips with me . If you are looking for a precise phrase or name , put quotes around it . If you run across a link to " page missing , " just click the CACHED button below each listing to retrieve an earlier copy of the page saved to Google 's server . And if you see a link that looks especially useful , click on the GOOGLESCOUT button for more like it . <P> Of course , as much as I like Google , I know other sites have some handy features that Google does n't offer . If you want to search specifically for M or image files , Altavista and Lycos are the places to go . Altavista also lets you search in 25 languages and has a handy translation feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine-tune their searches by everything from date ranges to file types . And for broad searches of , say , exotic birds , Yahoo 's orderly directories help focus your thinking into manageable subtopics . But for everyday queries , make your life easy : just go to
