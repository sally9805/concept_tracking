1 <br> <p> Jocelyn glanced at herself in the hotel mirror for the last time . This is it , she thought . This is the moment . Her instinct was to put her nightgown back on and climb back into bed . Wonder what was on HBO during the day ? Did this hotel have HBO ? Maybe she should look for a hotel that did . <p> She took a deep breath , looked back at the mirror , and straightened her shoulders . What would Miss Edi say if she saw her slumping like this ? At the thought of Miss Edi , tears again came to her eyes , but she blinked them away . It had been four months since the funeral , but she still missed her friend so much she sometimes did n't know how to function . Every day she wanted to call Miss Edi and tell her something that had happened , but each day she discovered afresh that she was gone . <p> " I can do this , " Joce said as she looked in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was dressed conservatively , in a skirt and an ironed , white cotton blouse , just the way Miss Edi had taught her . Her shoulder- length , dark blonde hair was pulled back with a headband , and she had on very little makeup . All she knew about the town of Edilean , Virginia , was that Miss Edi had grown up there , so Jocelyn did n't want to arrive in jeans and a tube top and shock the locals . <p> She picked up her car keys , grabbed the handle of her big black suitcase , and rolled it to the door . Tonight she 'd be sleeping in her own house . It was a house she 'd never seen , never even heard about until a lawyer told Joce she 'd inherited it , but it was still hers . <p> Just days ago , she 'd sat in the lawyer 's office in Boca Raton , Florida , dressed all in black and wearing the pearls Miss Edi had given her . It was months after Miss Edi 's funeral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the first day of May after she died . If she 'd died on June the first , that would have meant waiting eleven months . But she 'd died in her sleep just into the new year , so Jocelyn had had time to grieve before facing the ordeal of hearing what was in the will . <p> Beside her sat her father , his wife beside him , and next to her were the Steps , Belinda and Ashley . But now they were better known as Bell and Ash . Due to their mother 's indefatigable efforts , they 'd become models  --  and the media had loved the idea of there being two of them . In the last ten years they 'd been on the covers of all the top magazines . They 'd traveled all over the world and modeled the clothes of every designer . When they walked through a mall , teenage girls followed them , their mouths open in awe . And males of every age looked at them with lust . <p> But for all their fame , to Jocelyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all kids together . As children , the twins loved to make up things they said Joce had done to them , then tell their mother . Louisa used to glare at her stepdaughter and say , " Wait ' til your father gets home . " But when Gary Minton returned , he 'd just shake his head and do whatever he could to stay out of the turmoil . His objective in life was to have a good time , not to referee his three children . He 'd retreat to his garage workshop , his wife and his tall stepdaughters trailing behind him . Jocelyn would leave and go to Miss Edi . <p> " So what did the old witch leave you ? " Bell asked as she stretched her long neck to see Jocelyn at the far end of the row of chairs . <p> For Joce , it had never been difficult to tell the twins apart . Bell was the smarter of the two , the leader , while Ash was quieter and did whatever her sister wanted her to . Since that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ash was often the one to stay away from . <p> " Her love , " Jocelyn said , refusing to look at her stepsister . Bell was on her third husband now , and her mother was hinting that that marriage was about to fail . " Poor thing , " her mother said . " Those men just do n't understand my darling baby . " <p> " They do n't understand her belief that she can have affairs even if she 's married , " Joce muttered under her breath . <p> " What was that ? " Louisa asked sharply , sounding as though she were about to say " Wait ' til your father gets home . " The woman could n't seem to understand that her " babies " would turn thirty this year and that their fifteen minutes of fame was already on the downward spiral . Just last week Joce had read that two eighteen-year-old girls were " the new Bell and Ash . " <p> Jocelyn did n't begrudge the Steps their fame  --  or the fortune that they seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : always bad tempered , jealous of everyone , and disdainful of anyone who was n't in the gossip rags every week . When they were kids , they 'd been extremely envious of Jocelyn because she spent so much time at " that rich old bat 's house . " They refused to believe that Miss Edi did n't give Joce bags full of money every week . " If she does n't give you things , then why do you go over there ? " <p> " Because I like her ! " Joce said again and again . " No . I love her . " <p> " Ahhhh , " they would say in that tone that was meant to say they knew everything . <p> Joce would just shut the door to her bedroom in their faces , or , better yet , she 'd go to Miss Edi 's house . <p> But now Miss Edi was gone forever , and Jocelyn was requested to be at the reading of the will . The lawyer , a man who looked to be older than Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sight of the five of them . " I was told it would just be Miss Jocelyn , " he said , glancing at her , then looking at her father as though demanding an explanation . <p> " I , uh ... , " Gary Minton started . The years had been kind to him , and he was still a handsome man . With his dark hair with just a touch of gray at the temples , and his dark brows , he looked much younger than he was . " We take care of our own , " said his wife from beside him . It was as though the years Gary 's face did n't carry were etched on his wife 's . Sun , cigarettes , and wind had weathered her skin so she looked like a dried-up mummy . <p> " You do n't mind if we 're here , do you ? " Bell said in a purring voice to the lawyer . Both twins were wearing micro-miniskirts , their famous long legs stretched out until they nearly touched his desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist . <p> Mr. Johnson glanced at them over his half glasses and gave a bit of a frown . He seemed to want to tell them to put their clothes on . He looked back at Jocelyn , noted her plain black suit with the crisp white blouse under it , the pearls around her neck , and gave a little smile . " If Miss Jocelyn approves , you may remain . " <p> " Oh , la tee da , " Ash said . " Miss Jocelyn . Miss college- educated Jocelyn . Will you read a book to us ? " <p> " I 'm sure someone will have to , " Jocelyn said without taking her eyes off the lawyer . " They can stay . They 'll find out everything anyway . " <p> " All right then . " He looked down at the papers . " Basically , Edilean Harcourt left you , Jocelyn Minton , everything . " <p> " And how much is that ? " Bell asked quickly . <p> Mr. Johnson turned to her . " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells you is her concern , but I will say nothing . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have work to do . " He picked up a brown paper , string- tied folder and handed it across the desk to Jocelyn . " All the information is in there , and you may look through the documents in your own time . " <p> When he remained standing , Joce also stood . " Thank you , " she said as she took the portfolio . " I 'll read it later . " <p> " I would suggest that you read it when you 're alone . In privacy . Edilean wrote some things that I think she meant only for you to see . " <p> " Everything to her ? " Ash asked , at last understanding what had been said . " But what about us ? We used to visit the old woman all the time . " <p> Mr. Johnson 's old face moved into a bit of a smile . " How could I have forgotten ? " He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer in his desk . " She left these for you . " <p> He held out two small , blue satin bags , and the contents looked to be bumpy , as though they contained jewels . <p> " Oooooh , " Bell and Ash said in unison . " For us ? Why that darling . She should n't have . We really did n't expect anything . " <p> With their much-photographed faces alight , they opened the bags , then looked up at the lawyer in consternation . " What are these ? " <p> Ash dumped the contents of her bag into the palm of her hand . There were about twenty small black objects , some of which had been emerald cut , some in the round diamond shape . " What are they ? I 've never seen stones like these before . " <p> " Are they black diamonds ? " Bell asked . <p> " In a way , they are , " Mr. Johnson said , then , still smiling , he started for the door , but he paused with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gave Jocelyn a wink , then he left the room . <p> Joce had to work to keep a straight face . The " black diamonds " that Miss Edi had left for the stepsisters were actually pieces of coal . <p> She did n't say a word as they left the offices . She sat in the back of the car on the drive home and listened as Bell and Ash , sitting beside her , held the pieces of coal up to the light and exclaimed over their beauty and discussed how they were going to have them set . <p> Joce looked out the window to hide her smile . The joke that Miss Edi had left her jealous , greedy stepsisters lumps of coal made her miss her friend with a painful longing . Miss Edi had been mother , grandmother , friend , and mentor all in one . <p> Joce glanced up and saw her father frowning at her in the rearview mirror . She could see that he knew what the " stones " were and he was dreading the coming fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . She planned to be gone long before the Steps discovered what the black stones were . Her bags were packed and in the back of her car , and as soon as they got home , she was going back to her job at the university . <p> Only when Jocelyn was back at school and in her tiny apartment did she open the packet that contained Miss Edi 's will . She 'd tried to steel herself for what she 'd find , but nothing prepared her to see an envelope with that beloved handwriting on it . <p> TO MY JOCELYN it said on the envelope . <p> With trembling hands , she opened it , pulled out the letter , and began to read . <br> My dear , dear Jocelyn , <br> I promise I wo n't be maudlin . I do n't know if it 's been days or months since my demise , but knowing your soft heart , you 're probably still grieving . I know all too well what it is to lose people you love . I 've had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . I was very nearly the last one left . Now , to business . The house in Boca is not mine , nor is most of the furniture . By now I 'm sure the contents have been moved out and put up for auction . But do n't worry , my dear , the best of what I owned , meaning everything that I took from Edilean Manor , will go back to where it came from . <br> <p> Jocelyn put the letter down . " Edilean Manor ? " she said aloud . She 'd never heard of the place . After her initial confusion , a feeling of betrayal ran through her . She 'd spent a great deal of her life with Miss Edi , had traveled with her , met many people from her past , and had heard hundreds of stories about her time with Dr. Brenner . But Miss Edi had never mentioned Edilean Manor . It must have been important , as it was named for Miss Edi  --  or she was named for it . <p> Jocelyn looked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're angry and hurt . I can see that frown of yours . I told you so much about my life , but I never mentioned Edilean , Virginia . As you can guess from the unusual name , the town " belonged " to my family  --  or at least we thought it did . Centuries ago , my ancestor came from Scotland with an elegant wife and a wagonload of gold . He bought a thousand acres outside Williamsburg , Virginia , laid out a town square , then named the place after his young wife . The legend in my family is that his wife was of a much higher class than he was , but when her father refused to let his daughter marry the stable lad , he ran off with the girl and a great deal of her father 's money . No one ever knew if she was abducted or if she went willingly . I 'm sure the truth is much less romantic than that , but Angus Harcourt did build a big brick house in about 1770 , and my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father left the house to me alone because my brother , Bertrand , could n't manage money . If he had a dime , he 'd buy something that cost a quarter . I grew up sure that I 'd live in Edilean Manor with David Aldredge , the man I was engaged to , and raise a strong , healthy , handsome family . But , alas , fate has a way of changing our lives . In this case , it was a war that changed everything and everyone . When I left Edilean , I let my brother live in the house , but I kept strict watch over him . Bertrand died a long time ago , and for years now the house has been empty . Dear Jocelyn , I 'm leaving you a house you 've never heard of in a town I carefully never mentioned . <br> <p> Jocelyn put the letter down and stared into space for a moment . A house built in 1770 ? And outside beautiful Williamsburg ? She looked around her drab little apartment . It had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire house ! An old one ! <p> She looked back down at the letter . <br> There 's something else I want to tell you . Remember how good I was at knowing who at church would make a good ouple and who would n't last six months ? If you 'll remember , I was always right . I 'm sure you also remember that I learned from experience not to interfere in your personal life  --  after you were old enough to have one , that is . But now I can no longer see your wrath , so I 'm going to tell you something . The perfect man for you lives in Edilean . He 's the grandson of two friends with whom I went to high school , Alex and Lissie McDowell . They 're gone now , but their grandson looks so much like Alex that I thought he 'd never aged . On one of my trips to Edilean  --  yes , dear , I went in secret  --  I told Alex that , and he laughed hard . It was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past when he found nothing to amuse him . His wife , Lissie , was a saint for what she did . I look forward to seeing them both again in a Better Place . <br> <p> Jocelyn looked up . A man for her ? The thought made her want to smile and cry at the same time . Twice , Miss Edi had tried to match her up with young men from church , but both times she 'd refused to so much as go out to dinner with them . They were boring young men , and she doubted if either of them had ever had a creative thought in his life . She had n't given her reasons for turning the men down , but Miss Edi had known what was going on . " Beer drinking does not qualify as an Olympic sport , " she 'd said quietly , then walked away . Joce 's face had turned three shades of red . Two weeks before , Miss Edi had driven by Jocelyn 's house when she 'd been standing outside with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For all that Joce loved the ballet , she was sometimes drawn to the life her family led . <p> " Like my mother , " she said aloud , then looked back down at the letter . <br> His name is Ramsey McDowell and he 's an attorney . But I can assure you that he 's more than that . My last request of you is that you give the young man a chance to show you that he 's right for you . And , remember : I am never wrong about these things . As for the house , there 's some furniture in it , but not much , and there are some tenants in the wings . They are both young women from families I 've known for many years . Sara grew up in Edilean , so she can help you find whatever you need . Tess is new to the area , but I knew her grandmother better than I wanted to . That 's all , my dear . I know you 'll make the best of all that I leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , but the poor dear was older than I am . I have a gardener , so maybe he can help you with whatever else you need . I wish you all the luck in the world , and please remember that I 'll be watching over you every minute of your life . <br> <p> It took Jocelyn the rest of the evening to recover from the letter . It sounded so much like Miss Edi that it was almost as though she were in the room with her . She slept with the letter curled up in her hands . <p> The next morning , her mind was so full of all that she 'd learned in the last twenty-four hours that she could barely concentrate . Her job as teaching assistant had become uncomfortable because she 'd had a year-long affair with one of the other assistants . When they had to work together , he scowled at her across the table and she found it very unpleasant . <p> He 'd been the third man in a row who had been perfectly suitable for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on with any of them . Jocelyn knew it was all Miss Edi 's fault . She 'd told Jocelyn about the man she 'd been in love with who 'd been killed in World War II  --  a true love , and that 's what Joce wanted . <p> " He was my all to me , " Miss Edi said in the voice that she used only when she spoke of him . She had only one small photo of him in his uniform , which was inside a folding picture frame she kept by her bed . He was an extraordinarily good-looking young man , with dark blond hair , and a strong chin . The frame was oval , and on the other side was a photo of Miss Edi in her army uniform . She was so young , so beautiful . Beneath David 's photo was a tiny braid of hair , her dark intertwined with his blond . Miss Edi would hold the frame , say , " David , " then her eyes would glaze over . <p> Over the years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would just say he was a young man from her war experience  --  which had been brutal and she had the scars to prove it . <p> But at last Jocelyn had found out something about him . His name was David Aldredge , and he and Miss Edi had been engaged to be married in Edilean , Virginia . But David 's death in the war had ended that . <p> " No wonder she could n't bear to mention Edilean , " Jocelyn whispered . <p> To Jocelyn , Miss Edi 's love for the man had become a legend . It epitomized the love that she wanted . But so far , Joce had n't been able to find it . Miss Edi never knew it , but Joce had twice lived with young men , and she 'd been quite happy with the arrangement . It was nice to have someone to go home to , to tell about her day , and to laugh with about what had gone on . But when the men started talking about rings and mortgages and babies , Jocelyn ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing from her relationships , but it was n't there  --  and she was going to hold out until it was . <p> And now Miss Edi had given her a way to change everything . That evening , she looked through the legal papers , read them carefully , and held the key that was in the package . All the legal work was being handled by the firm of McDowell , Aldredge , and Welsch in Edilean , Virginia . <p> The name of " Aldredge " made her pause for a moment before she could go on . Did descendants of Miss Edi 's David still live there ? <p> A letter was included saying that when she got to Edilean , she should stop by the office and she 'd be told about the financial arrangements . The letter was signed by Ramsey McDowell . <p> Jocelyn shook her head at Miss Edi 's letter . " You never give up , do you ? " she said , her eyes raised upward . But the truth was that Miss Edi was always right about the couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at a young couple who were more interested in each other than what the pastor had to say . Afterward , she 'd tell Jocelyn  --  and only her  --  what she thought of them . " True love , " she 'd sometimes say , but not very often . " Pure sex , " she said once and made Joce laugh . She was right both times . <p> " Ramsey McDowell , " Jocelyn said , then looked back at the letter . He 'd put his home phone number on there . It was only seven . On impulse , she picked up her cell , called him , and he answered on the third ring . <p> " Hello ? " <p> His voice was nice , deep and smooth . Like chocolate , she thought . " Is this Mr. McDowell ? " <p> " I think of that as being my father , but I guess I qualify . Is this Miss Minton ? " <p> She hesitated . How had he known that ? " Caller ID . " <p> " Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know how we lawyers are . We must fight off the masses because of our underhanded dealings . Are you going to be here soon ? " <p> " I do n't know , " Joce said , smiling at his sense of humor . " This is all quite new to me . I 'd never heard of Edilean , Virginia , until I saw the will , so I 'm still in a bit of shock . " <p> " Never heard of us ? I 'll have you know we 're the biggest small town in Virginia . Or is that the smallest big town ? I never can remember what our mayor says we are . Ask me what you need to know and I 'll tell you everything . Oh ! Wait ! I need to fasten a diaper . There , that 's done . Now , what can I tell you about us ? " <p> " Diaper ? You 're married ? " Her shocked tone told too much , and when he hesitated before answering , she grimaced . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out like corn over a grill . She just stuck her tongue out at me , but then the baby kicked . The one inside her , that is . And the one on her hip . Excuse me , Miss Minton , but I have to take the phone to another room before my sister throws something at me . " <p> Joce was smiling as she waited , hearing footsteps , then a door close and , finally , quiet . <p> " There now , I 'm in what passes for a library in my house and I 'm all yours . Figuratively speaking that is . Now tell me what I can do for you . " <p> " I do n't really know . I did n't know Miss Edi owned a house , much less a town . " <p> " Actually , she had to give us our freedom in 1864 , and  --  " " Three , " Joce said before she thought , then wished she had n't . <p> " Sorry , you were saying ? " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the day ? " <p> " January the first , " she said cautiously , not sure if this would get her labeled as a know-it-all or worse . <p> " January the first , 1863 . Well , Miss Minton , I can see that you and I are going to get along quite well . " There was a change in his voice as he went from teasing banter to more serious . " What can I tell you ? " <p> " I do n't know where to begin . I want to know about the house , the town , about the people . Everything . " <p> " It would take much too much time to talk about all of this over the phone , " he said . " My suggestion is that you come here to Edilean and we sit down and talk about everything in person . How about if we have dinner and discuss this at length ? Shall we say Saturday next at eight ? " <p> She drew in her breath . That was just eight days away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then . " <p> " Shall I send a car ? " <p> " I , uh , no , that wo n't be necessary . I have a car . How do I keep the roof repaired ? " she blurted . <p> " A practical woman , " Ramsey said . " I like that . I 'm not at liberty to say the exact extent of what Miss Edi left you , but I can assure you that you 'll be able to keep the roof in great repair . " <p> She smiled at that . She did n't relish the idea of having the responsibility of the care of a very old house and no way to support it . <p> " Miss Minton , what is your hesitation ? The beautiful town of Edilean is awaiting you , plus a magnificent old house , and Colonial Williamsburg is right next door . What more could you want ? " <p> She started to say " Time , " but did n't . Suddenly , she had one of those moments that rarely happen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was going to do : She was going to change her life . Since Miss Edi 's death , Jocelyn had n't made a single change . She had the same job she no longer liked , the same routine , the same dull , dark apartment . Her friends now looked at her with sadness because Joce was no longer part of a couple . They were already talking about fixing her up with blind dates . The real difference in Jocelyn 's life was that her best friend was gone . Now , if she went " home " it was to her father 's house , to motorcycles outside , NASCAR on the TV inside , and the pitying looks of her stepmother . Poor Jocelyn , she had nothing and no one . <p> This was Friday , and if she quit her job tomorrow morning , then she 'd have days to sort out all the things she needed to do , like turn off the water , and  --  <p> " Could I wire you some money ? " he asked , seeming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , wait , that 's no good . You 'd have to give me your bank account numbers and you should n't do that . For all you know I 'm a ... " He hesitated . <p> " A lawyer ? " <p> " That 's right . Scum of the earth . We spend years in school learning how to rip people off . How about if I overnight you a check ? " <p> " I have enough to do what I need to , " she said . " It 's just that this is a big step . " <p> " If you know the date of the Emancipation Proclamation , then you love history . So how can you wait to see a house that was built in the eighteenth century ? No velvet ropes anywhere . You can explore all you want . Did you know that the stables were recently rebuilt ? And there 's a cellar that 's intact . And I believe the attic is full of trunks of old clothes and diaries . " <p> " Mr. McDowell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling around the country on a covered wagon and selling snake oil . " <p> " No , no snake oil . I sell Miss Edi 's Golden Elixir . It 's made from rainbows and flecked with gold dust from the leprechauns ' pots . Guaranteed to cure anything that ails you . You have a boyfriend ? " <p> " And what will the elixir do to him ? " she asked , smiling . <p> " No , " he said , seriously , " do you have a boyfriend ? " <p> " Not since he asked me to marry him and I ran away screaming . " <p> " Ah , " he said . <p> Joce wished she could take back her comment . " I mean , it was n't actually like that . He 's very nice and I 'm not adverse to marriage , but  --  " <p> " No explanation needed . My last girlfriend led me into a jewelry store and they had to take me away in an ambulance . " <p> " A kindred soul . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Maybe you should n't make reservations yet , " she said cautiously . " In case I do n't make it out of here in time . " <p> " Who said anything about reservations ? I was thinking about wine and pasta served on a tablecloth on the floor of your new eighteenth-century house . By candlelight . With strawberries dipped in warm chocolate for dessert . " <p> " Oh , my goodness , " she said . " You are going to be a problem , are n't you ? " <p> " I hope so . I like a girl who knows her history . And I like this photo of you that Miss Edi sent me last year . You still have this red bikini ? " <p> Jocelyn could n't contain her laugh . " She passed that thing around to half the men at our church . When I had my twenty-sixth birthday and still was n't married , I thought she was going to staple it to the trees and leave a phone number . " <p> " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a touch of fear in his voice . She could almost hear the unasked question of , How many birthdays ago was that ? <p> " Actually , it was quite a while ago , " she said mischievously . " So , shall I see you at the end of the week ? " <p> " I 'll be there , " he said , but his voice was no longer so buoyant . <p> Jocelyn hung up and mentally began a list that started with " go to the gym every day this week . " The photo of her in the bikini had been taken just last summer , but who knew what had happened under her clothes during the winter ? <p> So that was Ramsey McDowell , she thought as she got up and began to look through her closet . Tomorrow she 'd stop by her professor 's office and resign . She knew he would n't be bothered ; there were four applicants for every job on campus . <p> She paused with her hand on the clothes . Maybe now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe she could write the history of the town of Edilean . She 'd start with the Scotsman who stole a man 's gold and his beautiful daughter , then ran off to the wild country of America . What was Edilean like in 1770 ? For that matter , what was it like now ? <p> Ten minutes later , she 'd Googled the town . The history of the town was much what Miss Edi had written . It had been started by a Scotsman named Angus Harcourt , who 'd built a large house for his beautiful wife , then set about putting in acres of crops . But his wife , Edilean , had been lonely , so she 'd designed the streets of a tiny town that had eight small areas of parkland in it . Smack in the middle she 'd planted an oak tree from an acorn she 'd taken from her father 's estate . Over the centuries , the tree had been replaced three times , but each time the transplant had been a scion of the original tree . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Edilean Harcourt had led a four-year-long court battle when the state of Virginia tried to evict the residents , as over five thousand acres of the surrounding land was being turned into a nature preserve . " It was because Miss Edi  --  as she is called by everyone "  --  Joce read  --  " won the battle that the tiny town of Edilean survives today . No new houses are allowed to be built , but the ones that are there are preserved so that it 's almost like stepping back into time . <p> " The town has several upscale shops that draw tourists from Williamsburg , but the crowning jewel is Edilean Manor , built by Angus Harcourt in 1770 , and lived in by the same family since then . Unfortunately , the house and grounds are not open to the public . " <p> " I 'm glad of that , " Jocelyn said , then moved closer to the screen to see the photos and thought she could see a sign in front of one of the pretty white houses . Was that Ramsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he worked ? He 'd asked her if she had a boyfriend , but did he have a girlfriend ? <p> She clicked on the button that said EDILEAN MANOR , and there it was . Jocelyn stared at it with wide eyes . The fatade was perfectly symmetrical : two stories , five windows wide , all brick . On both sides were single-story wings with little porches on them . " I guess that 's where my tenants live , " she said , marveling at the idea that she now owned this wonderful old house . <p> Five minutes later , she was tearing through her closet like a leaf blower . She was going to get rid of all the things that she no longer wore , then see what was left . Fifteen minutes later , she looked at her nearly bare closet and said , " I 'm going shopping . " <p> The next few days had been a blur of activity as she hurried to get ready to leave , to go to her brand-new life . <p> And now , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , hotel checkout time , everything she owned was stuffed into her little Mini Cooper , and she was about to see " her house " for the first time . She did n't know if she was elated or scared to death .
