<p> The Indianapolis Colts are , at least for one more week , full speed ahead . Coach Tony Dungy said this week he is likely to play his regulars against the San Diego Chargers at the RCA Dome this weekend , when the Colts will be attempting to improve to 14-0 . <p> " This week I think we 're going to play it as a normal game , a game we want to win , and we 're going to do everything we can to win it , " Dungy said during a news conference . " Once we get to the two NFC games , I 'm not sure how we 're going to handle those . " <p> Dungy continues to make it clear that a Super Bowl title , not an undefeated season , is his primary goal . That could mean resting quarterback Peyton Manning , tailback Edgerrin James , wide receiver Marvin Harrison and other key players in the final two regular season games , at Seattle on Dec. 24 and at home against the Arizona Cardinals on Jan. 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday 's triumph at Jacksonville . <p> The Colts have a few injuries on defense . Linebacker Cato June sat out the Jaguars game because of knee and ankle injuries . Defensive tackle Corey Simon , a key to the Colts ' defensive improvement after being signed just before the season , hurt his foot Sunday and possibly wo n't play again until the playoffs . <p> If this indeed is the end , it is an inglorious ending for Brett Favre . <p> The Green Bay Packers have been playing out the string for quite a while . They have a record of 3-10 , which has them jockeying for a top draft pick instead of a playoff spot . The only element that makes their final three games worth noticing is the possibility they could be the last of Favre 's career . <p> The likely Hall of Fame quarterback has not said whether this season , his 15th in the NFL , will be his last . He is 36 , and he has talked about retirement for several years . He always has been able to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it has n't been much fun to be a Packer this season , and a quarterback who has endured for this long and absorbed so many walloping hits might not want to hang around for a rebuilding project . He seems unlikely to announce his intentions in the coming weeks , so fans at the Packers ' season finale against the Seahawks on Jan. 1 at Lambeau Field probably wo n't know if it 's Favre 's final game . <p> He has been dragged down to the Packers ' level of play this season . He has thrown for 3,161 yards and 19 touchdowns . But he also has tossed 22 interceptions , two shy of the career high he established a dozen years ago in his second season as an NFL starter . He is the league 's 24th-rated passer , putting him behind some less-than-legendary quarterbacks  --  including two , Oakland 's Kerry Collins and Cleveland 's Trent Dilfer , who recently lost their starting jobs . . . . <p> Raiders Coach Norv Turner 's fate may have been sealed with Sunday 's loss to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is en route to his second straight losing season , and he was n't owner Al Davis 's top choice in the first place . Davis first tried to hire Dallas Cowboys assistant head coach Sean Payton , but the two could n't complete a contract . . . . <p> Midway through last season , Kansas City Chiefs tailback Larry Johnson looked like a bust . The former first-round draft choice was stuck behind Priest Holmes and Derrick Blaylock on the depth chart . He had clashed publicly with Coach Dick Vermeil , and it looked like the club would trade him if it could . <p> But Johnson had some good games down the stretch last season . He stayed put in Kansas City and opened this season as Holmes 's understudy . Now , with Holmes sidelined by a neck injury , he is a blossoming star . Johnson has set a team record with six straight 100-yard rushing performances , running for 143 yards and three touchdowns in Sunday 's 31-28 loss at Dallas . <p> Consulting gigs have a way of turning into full-time jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jim Fassel , was a consultant to Ravens Coach Brian Billick last season . Washington Redskins offensive line guru Joe Bugel did consulting work for owner Daniel Snyder during the reign of former coach Steve Spurrier before being added to Joe Gibbs 's staff . <p> So while Houston Texans owner Bob McNair and Dan Reeves said this week Reeves was joining the downtrodden team as a consultant only and was n't a candidate for a more prominent job in the organization , that does n't necessarily mean the arrangement could n't be changed . McNair has been highly frustrated by the Texans ' 1-12 season , putting the job security of Coach Dom Capers and General Manager Charley Casserly in question . Both McNair and Reeves are University of South Carolina alums , and McNair contacted the former Denver Broncos , New York Giants and Atlanta Falcons coach on Thursday . . . . <p> Members of the NFL 's competition committee undoubtedly will have to take a look in the offseason at the strange play Sunday night that helped the Packers beat the Detroit Lions . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackled in the end zone for a safety that would have put the Lions in the lead . But just before hitting the ground , he extended the ball and tossed it forward out of the end zone , where a Packers player fell on it . Meantime , Green Bay tackle Mark Tauscher committed a holding penalty . <p> The officials initially called Gado for intentional grounding and awarded the Lions a safety . But then they re-huddled and determined Gado was outside the tackle box , meaning there was no intentional grounding ( a passer can throw the ball away intentionally if he 's outside the tackles and his pass reaches the line of scrimmage ) and the play was deemed an incomplete pass . The officials ruled Tauscher 's holding penalty had not come in the end zone , although replays showed it had and thus should have resulted in a safety . <p> The Lions did n't get their safety . The Packers retained possession , moved the ball out of the shadow of their goal line and eventually won in overtime . The key issue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about to be tackled for a loss merely needs to heave the ball out of bounds and , as long as he 's outside the tackles , his team will end up with an incompletion . . . . <p> Injured tailback Brian Westbrook , tight end L.J . Smith and defensive end Jevon Kearse were among the Eagles players who attended deactivated wide receiver Terrell Owens 's birthday party Monday night at an Atlantic City nightclub . Close to 20 Eagles players reportedly attended , although quarterback Donovan McNabb was not among them . . . . <p> The Eagles yesterday promoted quarterback Andy Hall from the practice squad to take the roster spot of Westbrook , who was placed on the injured reserve list . Hall could end up backing up Koy Detmer if Detmer takes over at quarterback this week for Mike McMahon , who hurt his hip and knee during Sunday 's overtime loss to the Giants . . . . <p> The Giants probably will be without middle linebacker Antonio Pierce , who has a high ankle sprain , for Saturday 's game against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured reserve with a hamstring problem . . . . A groin injury could keep Denver rookie cornerback Darrent Williams sidelined at least a month . . . . Falcons quarterback Michael Vick left Monday night 's triumph over the New Orleans Saints with bruised ribs , but probably will be back in the lineup this weekend . . . . Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Deshea Townsend is questionable for Sunday 's game at Minnesota with a sprained neck . . . . <p> The architectural firm hired to assess the damage to the Superdome , Ellerbe Becket , concluded in a report released yesterday repairs will cost about $140 million and could be completed in time for the building to host games by Nov. 1 .
