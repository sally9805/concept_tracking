A low-fat diet may be good for the heart , but a moderate-fat diet ( in which 33% of calories come from fats , half of which are the monounsaturated fats found in peanuts and peanut oil ) seems to reduce a person 's cardiovascular risk even more , according to a new study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . The low-fat diet ( in which 18% of calories are from fat ) decreased by 12% the dieter 's levels of HDL ( " good " ) cholesterol , which protects against heart disease . The moderate-fat diet produced no decrease in heart-friendly HDL.  --  By David Bjerklie
