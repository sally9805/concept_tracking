When you listen to Babyface 's latest CD , you 're going to hear a side of him that you have never heard before . He says the CD , Playlist , is very personal , " a very private record . " The CD finds Kenny " Babyface " Edmonds paying tribute to his biggest musical influences , which include pop icons James Taylor and Bob Dylan . The soft-spoken performer also sings a revealing , heart-wrenching song to his children about his much-publicized divorce from their mother and his wife of 13 years , Tracey Edmonds . Playlist showcases Babyface moving on with his life , taking his music in a new direction and finding love along the way . " I 've always been interested in doing a record of songs that I grew up with and that I love , " he tells JET over lunch at Maze Restaurant at New York 's London Hotel . " These songs were kind of the road map of how I became the artist-producer that I am today . And why I was able to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &B."; He sings James Taylor 's Fire And Rain , Jim Croce 's Time In A Bottle , Bob Dylan 's Knockin ' On Heaven 's Door and Dan Fogelberg 's Longer . He wants his fans to know , however , that he is not abandoning his R &B; roots . " One may look at this record and say " he has turned away from R &B,"; just the titles alone , until you listen to it . It is a little more soulful than the originals . I am not leaving R &B,"; he emphasizes . " It is not your typical R &B; record or pop record for that matter . You would n't think of a Black guy doing this kind of music . Coming from Whip Appeal to these songs , it seems like a stretch , " he laughs . " But it does n't feel like that to me . " When he was in the 7th and 8th grade in Indianapolis , he reveals that he used to sneak out of church early and sit in the family car and listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton . " I was learning how to play acoustic guitar , so I related to their sound . In R &B,; you did n't hear acoustic guitar that much . Perhaps the biggest artist we recognize in terms of R &B; was Bill Withers , other than that , you would n't hear it in straight R &B.; I listened to R &B; artists , but I also listened to acoustic rock music and artists who had groat songs and great melodies . " Kevon Edmonds , his brother and a lead singer in the R &B; group After 7 , was right there wit Ii him when he discovered the pop classics . " After the singing was over in church , we would take the back stairwell out to the car and play the radio , " Kevon Edmonds laughs . " The songs you hear on the Playlist album would come on the radio . I knew them like he knew them . This music has resided in his spirit for a long time . " Antonio " L.A. " Reid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jet : " I love the record . I love the honesty in his production and the simplicity of his vocals and lyrics . I love the fact that Kenny is so diverse as an artist . It 's a little bit of a departure from his most recent studio albums , hut it is an honest album . This is who Babyface was when I met him . " Babyface and Reid , who had performed together in the ' ' 80s R &B; group The Deele , founded LaFacc Records in 1989 ( the recording home over the years of Toni Braxton , Usher , TLC and OutKast ) . Babyface has written tunes for Mary J. Blige , Mariah Carey , Eric Clapton , Aretha Franklin and others . He also wrote and produced most songs for the 7-million selling Waiting to Exhale soundtrack featuring Mary J. Bilge 's Not don ' Cry and Whitney Houston 's Exhale ( ShoopShoop ) . As a solo artist , his hits include Whip Appeal , My Kinda Gin , Tender Love and It 's No Crime from the 198 ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the Cool in You . On Playlist , Babyface also performs the tender tearjerker Not Going Nowhere , a song he wrote to his children about the divorce . The song attempts to reassure his sons , Brandon , 11 , and Dylan , 6 , that he is still in their lives , even though he is no longer with their mother . " One day I was sitting down in the studio and I just started playing chords and the conversation came , a conversation with Tracey one night and hearing that Dylan was crying for me , " Where is my Dad ? " and the fact that I was n't there . " He explains , " The song lets my kids know that we are good . And they do n't have to worry about their father not being there for them or that the changes that happened are really going to affect them and their relationship with me or me and their mom . When I finished it , I felt like I had written something that was very personal . " During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining that the media built them up as an ideal , perfect couple . " No one has a perfect life . We were not a perfect couple . Because we were on the EBONYs and JETS , there was a pressure to hold it together . The most important thing that I have learned is being honest to yourself . You have to be honest enough to answer the question in a truthful way and be brave enough to hear the answers you are going to hear . But you do n't want to rock the boat that seems like it is a perfect boat . You do n't want to disappoint others . You are starting to live for other people . You are watching other people watching you and believing that you are the perfect couple and have the perfect life . " He says he and Tracey were secretly separated for three years before divorcing . " No one really knew we were separated ; we just kept up the face of being together . We were very private and kept it to ourselves . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but happiness for her . And she wanted nothing but happiness for me . If that meant we were not going to be together anymore that 's OK . No one 's hurting . No one 's mad . Our kids are loved . They never , in their lives , saw me and Tracey arguing or raising voices at each other . " He says he 's cool with Tracey and her engagement to superstar Eddie Murphy . " Real love goes beyond jealousy and insecurity . Tracey let me go and I let her go . That was the best thing we could do lor each other and it 's working out good . " He adds , " When Tracey was dating Eddie I knew about it , when Tracey was getting engaged to Eddie , we talked about it . It did n't come as a surprise . Eddie seems to be a good guy . I 'm cool with Eddie . I always respected his work and he has always respected mine . 1 congratulated him when he got the Golden ( ilobe nomination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar nomination . " He says th media attention he received when he married Tracey has taught him something-he does n't like living his private life in public . That 's why he does n't talk much about his new girlfriend , Nicole " Nikki " Pantenburg , a former dancer from Janet Jackson 's Velvet Rope Tour . " I 'm really tight-lipped and my reason is exactly what it was before living my life in front of the world and being put on a pedestal . But you ask for that when you open up the door and say come to my house , take a picture of my house , take a picture of my kids , look at my family . I 'm not saying I will never open the door , but it 's not something I want to do right now . " He does reveal that Nikki is " the sweetest person I 've ever met ; very , very real and very honest , just down , all the way down . I do n't want people ruining her life . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of respect to her . " Reflecting on his new musical direction and love , he says , " We are all on a journey .
