" The cycle , as I understand it , is that your city doctors go to the States for richer pickings . And then your rural doctors come here ( to urban centers ) and our doctors go to your rural areas . And we get Cuban doctors . " 2 <p> In 1998 , the provincial government of Alberta , Canada , developed a proactive strategy to deal with the growing shortage of family doctors in rural communities of the province. 3 The government 's health ministry retained a private immigration agency to recruit South African doctors . The agency launched a recruiting drive in South Africa with lavish dinners and slick presentations for interested physicians . A chartered jet flew 44 physicians and their families to Canada for a weekend at Lake Louise , one of Canada 's premier tourist resorts . The physicians then dispersed to spend some time in the communities , where they were feted and offered considerable financial inducements to come . All subsequently decamped to Alberta , along with another 40 who emigrated under the same program without taking advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a South African doctor is $150,000 . The Alberta government spent a mere $1.2 million on the recruiting scheme , providing a $10.4 million net gain of medical expertise at South African expense. 4 Organized government-sponsored skills raiding of this kind represents one end of a spectrum of public and private-sector international recruiting activity that targets the skill base of developing countries like South Africa. 5 <p> The South African government has suggested that the movement of health professionals to other countries is primarily the result of organized skills raiding by other countries . The minister of health noted recently in parliament , for example , that the government would " continue to object vigorously whenever developed countries plunder the meager skills resources of developing countries in organized raids . Countries that systematically under-produce skilled workers because it is cheaper to poach them from poorer countries are guilty of exploitation . " 6 In April 2001 , the president of the South African Medical Research Council , Dr William Makgoba , visited Canada as an emissary of the South African government to protest against the organized poaching of South African health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Makgoba and his government , the charge that Canada was raiding South Africa 's skills base was treated with considerable indifference by his hosts . The main charge was openly admitted ; but the blame was often displaced onto either the United States or South Africa itself . As long as Canadian-trained health professionals continue to be poached by the United States , Canada had little alternative but to make up its own shortfall from places like South Africa . Alternatively , as the head of the Canadian Medical Association suggested , the South African government should accept responsibility for not retaining its doctors by making conditions more attractive for them at home. 8 While there has been no repetition of the Alberta recruiting junket , only one Canadian province ( Nova Scotia ) agreed not to recruit doctors actively in South Africa . Meanwhile , Canadian , Australian and British agencies continue to recruit South African professionals aggressively in the medical , education , IT and commercial sectors . <p> The strategy of replacement recruiting is central to Canadian policy discourse on skilled immigration . In policy terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use " rest-of-the-world human capital " to substitute for Canadian flows to the United States. 9 Canada now views the world as a global hunting ground for skills that are in increasingly short supply domestically. 10 New immigration legislation aims to streamline and facilitate the permanent import of skills from abroad . There is little in this public policy discourse that acknowledges that there may be serious negative impacts on the source areas of skilled migrants , particularly in the south. 11 Even the academic literature is surprisingly silent on this score . Indeed , the currently fashionable transnationalism thesis sometimes conveys the unfortunate , and no doubt unintended , message that contemporary skills migration between the south and the north is fundamentally symbiotic. 12 New transnational immigrants , with their penchant for keeping a foot in both societies , supposedly ensure that modern immigration is mutually beneficial for both sending and receiving countries . <p> Globalization , as a number of scholars have pointed out , has fundamental implications for the mobility of people in general and for sidled persons in particular. 13 As Robyn Iredale suggests , an increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professions and professional labor markets. 14 Sourcing of skills from outside the boundaries of the nation-state is an increasingly important method of making up for domestic training and experience shortfalls , compensating for brain drains to other jurisdictions and countering the impact of aging populations. 15 The new global marketplace for skills facilitates aggressive transnational recruiting by both governments and the private sector . The ability of some ( northern ) states to exercise considerable competitive advantage in the skills marl , et is apparent . There are inevitably going to be losers in this game , and the majority of them will be in the south , not the north . Yet to speak in binary terms of a north that gains and a south that loses is clearly much too simplistic in this context. 16 The United States and some European states are clear winners . Canada both gains and loses , as do many other countries . States that can not join the game will simply be targets of skills raiders to their obvious detriment . <p> Beyond the negative connotations of the image of the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematic evaluation and inventory of the actual impacts of skills emigration. 17 The short and long-term damage to the economic and social prospects of a loser country is usually assumed to be so self-evident that it requires no investigation . One obvious response to skills loss , increasingly fine tuned by Canada , is replacement recruiting , either through active state or private sector recruitment campaigns or careful selection in the refugee camps of the world . In most cases , national self-interest seems to demand no less . Many states , including some in the south , certainly have the option of responding in like manner . <p> South Africa would seem , at face value , to be a major candidate for such a policy approach . The country has an advanced industrial economy and sits at the foot of a continent that is losing skills to non-African countries at an extraordinary rate. 18 There is clearly no shortage on the supply side . South Africa itself is bleeding skilled personnel at an accelerating rate. 19 Yet the country has not joined the global hunt for replacement skills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a principled stand against the idea of raiding countries and economies less privileged than its own ? If so , such a self-congratulatory argument lacks real conviction . Rather , South Africa represents in especially acute form the contradictions between globalization and nationalism , particularly when it comes to participation in the global market for skills . Regardless of the reasons , it is apparent that this policy position has driven the country to the brink of a serious skills deficit . The recent response to this perceived crisis starldy illustrates that the forces of globalization may eventually undermine and subvert even the most protectionist and nationalistic immigration policies . RAIDING SOUTH AFRICAN BRAINS <p> The collapse of the apartheid system in the 1980s and 1990s sparked a ( primarily white ) exodus from South Africa . Some of these emigrants are self-styled " refugees from democracy " ( privileged whites who , rather than contemplate the redistribution of privilege , have decided to leave for other shores ) . 20 Others are people with skills that are in high demand elsewhere . South Africa has easily the most advanced higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( particularly health , IT , engineering and accountancy ) , the skills produced are readily transferable to , and recognized and valued in , the industrial countries . As such , the United Kingdom , Australia , New Zealand , Canada and the United States have emerged as the destinations of choice . <p> Official South African emigration figures are highly misleading and give little concrete indication of the dimensions and likely impacts of the brain drain from the country . <p> South Africa , for example , recorded that a total of 62,088 people ( including 10,140 with professional qualifications ) emigrated from South Africa between 1987 and 1997 to the five main destination countries listed above . However , destination-country statistics of immigrant arrivals from South Africa paint a rather different picture : they show 32,296 professionals and 198,393 total immigrants arriving from South Africa during the same time period ( Table 1 ) . 21 Official South African emigration statistics therefore undercounted the loss by around two-thirds. 22 <p> Between 1998 and 2001 , a further 39,411 people officially emigrated from South Africa . Arrivals data are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of undercounting and ratio of total to professional emigration ( approx. 6:1 ) , it is reasonable to infer that a further 120,000 people including 20,000 professionals emigrated from South Africa during this time period . Overall , then , between 1987 and 2001 , South Africa lost an estimated 310,000 citizens , including 50,000 professionals . This is a significant brain drain by any standards. 23 These estimates undercount the outflow in at least two additional ways . First , South Africans do not only immigrate to the five countries discussed here . Second , there is considerable evidence from sectors such as health and education that skilled South Africans are being recruited for work overseas on fixed contract. 24 While it might be argued that this is a temporary loss , the impact on these over-burdened and under-staffed sectors within South Africa still appears to be considerable . <p> Recent research by the Southern African Migration Project ( SAMP ) suggests that the outflow of skills is unlikely to slow in the foreseeable future. 25 In a nationally representative sample survey of the skilled South African population , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to leaving permanently . Fifty-eight percent expressed a desire to leave and 49 percent said that it was likely or very likely that they would do so at some point . Although only 7 percent said that it was likely they would leave within six months , 25 percent said they would do so within two years and 42 percent within five years . Obviously , consideration and stated intent do not necessarily translate into actual departure , but the figures do suggest the existence of an extremely unsettled population . Unsurprisingly , the figures are also high for the prospect of temporary ( less than two years ) residence and work abroad . Fifty-five percent had a strong desire to leave for this period and 32 percent said they were likely or very likely to do so . <p> Several other findings from the survey are worth highlighting for the insights they bring into the dimensions of the ongoing brain drain from South Africa . First , of the 12 percent of the sample identified as having a very high emigration potential , 71 percent said they would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 57 percent were willing to renounce South African citizenship . Indicators of a possible transnational migration pattern were not much in evidence . Second , the preferred countries of emigration were the big five : the United States ( 24 percent ) , Australia ( 22 percent ) , the United Kingdom ( 15 percent ) , New Zealand ( 12 percent ) and Canada ( 11 percent ) . This suggests that these five countries will continue to both benefit from , and actively recruit , skilled South Africans . Third , and perhaps most interesting , the survey discovered little racial difference ; skilled black South Africans were just as likely to want to leave as whites . However , there was a distinct gender difference with males of all races more likely to want to leave than females. 26 <p> The magnitude of the current and future South African brain drain can not , of course , be attributed solely to skills raiding and the internationalization of the skills market . Nigel Harris , for example , has suggested that for the developing world as whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence " in the home country than theft by the developed countries . Skilled people undertake " a flight from spectacular misgovernment , from appalling working conditions and pay levels so low that they are below subsistence . " 27 Harris ' general scenario is hardly applicable to South Africa , however , where the country 's skilled still constitute a highly privileged labor aristocracy . Johann Van Rooyen suggests , rather , that crime and lack of personal security are " stoking the exodus from South Africa , " although his evidence is largely anecdotal. 28 <p> South Africa 's post-apartheid crime wave has been the subject of much commentary and not a little hyperbole. 29 A better measure of its impact on the brain drain is whether and how it has mediated the perceptions and intentions of potential migrs . In the national SAMP survey , skilled South Africans were asked about their level of dissatisfaction with a range of " quality of life " indicators. 30 Table 2 shows the proportion of respondents who were dissatisfied/very dissatisfied with the various measures , broken down by race. 31 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with economic conditions , such as the cost of living and levels of taxation . Interestingly , black skilled South Africans are far more dissatisfied with their levels of pay ( which may , in part , reflect the apartheid legacy ) . Personal safety and security concerns also rate very highly for all race groups . The vast majority felt that economic and security conditions would worsen in the next five years with whites slightly more pessimistic than blacks . The only other significant difference between black and white South Africans is in their perception of their children 's future in South Africa with the former far more optimistic . No significant gender differences emerged in the survey. 32 Another set of questions probed skilled South Africans on their perceptions of government . Here there were major differences by race with whites feeling extremely alienated from the political process as compared to blacks . For example , 67 percent of blacks but only 17 percent of whites approved of the way that the national government had performed over the previous twelve months . Or again , 74 percent of blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in hearing what they thought. 33 Unsurprisingly , 83 percent of whites but only 20 percent of blacks opposed/strongly opposed the government 's corrective affirmative action policies . <p> In general , the research shows that South Africa 's skilled population is very nervous and dissatisfied with economic and security conditions in the county . And they do not perceive that things will improve . A final question probed those with high emigration potential to ascertain whether anything could be done to make them stay . Interestingly , only 12 percent said nothing could be done . As many as one-quarter of respondents said that an improvement in the safety and security situation would make them change their minds. 34 These findings certainly suggest that all is not lost , but that South Africa 's skills base is currently a fertile recruiting ground for the global raiders . With a skilled population predisposed to leave by perceptions of economic decline and security threats and with doors wide open to five major industrialized countries , even the enticement of free junkets to Alberta seems rather extravagant and unnecessary . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on South Africa is ambiguous and deserving of more rigorous national-level study and analysis . Isolated sector studies have suggested that the temporary and permanent loss of skilled people is having a negative impact. 35 However , most assessments tend to avoid quantification of the actual costs and rely more on inference and anecdote . A recent survey of 200 private and public sector companies ( employing an estimated 101,000 people ) by SAMP certainly unveiled considerable private-sector concern. 36 The survey found that a third of the companies considered that post-1994 skills emigration had had a significant impact on their operations . Most affected was the high-tech sector ( 33 percent ) followed by manufacturing ( 11 percent ) , education/health ( 10 percent ) and business services ( 9 percent ) . Very few ( less than 3 percent in total ) felt that pre-1994 emigration had had any significant impact on their operations . <p> Public and official consciousness of the impact of the globalization of South African skills has grown apace . In the late 1990s , the idea that South Africa was in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business and business-allied think tanks have done the most to promote a doomsday vision of the economic future. 38 The English-language media faithfully weighed in with a series of provocative headlines and articles. 39 No less a personage than Nelson Mandela intervened on the other side , accusing those of leaving the country of being cowardly and unpatriotic. 40 Mandela 's intervention was important for the way in which it framed departure , not as a response to new opportunities for skilled South Africans attendant upon globalization but as a fundamental betrayal of the nation . In fact , the inter-penetration of nationalism and immigration has been a fundamental feature of the post-apartheid South African landscape , distorting perceptions and warping policy responses . CLOSING BORDERS <p> Both before and during the apartheid era , South Africa was an immigration country in the sense that legal immigration generally exceeded emigration . Economic boom periods , such as in the immediate post-Second World War period and the early 1960s , attracted considerable numbers of emigrants from Europe . Periods of domestic political turmoil , on the other hand , prompted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that South Africa 's white population was continually augmented from abroad . The racial qualifier is key since the country 's system of immigrant selection was fundamentally racist in character. 41 The government 's primary aim was to bolster the white population and all immigrants had , by definition , to be assimilable by that population . Immigrants did not have to begin at the bottom and work their way up . They arrived and were immediately privy to all of the social , economic and political rights and benefits conferred on whites by the apartheid system . <p> The clamor for white immigrants waxed and waned over time , as did the areas deemed suitable as sources of immigrants . Sally Peberdy has convincingly argued , however , that the drive for white immigrants was periodically over-ridden by an introspective nationalism , which viewed immigrants as a potential threat to national social cohesion. 42 At key moments of heightened white nationalism in twentieth-century South African history ( such as after union in 1910 , the advent of National Party rule in 1948 and the decision to become a republic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to immigration . These periods of introspection were generally short-lived as governments revisited their policies and aggressively began to recruit white immigrants from areas that were deemed suitable sources for that purpose. 43 Domestically , various social and economic programs for immigrants aimed to foster and hasten the integration process into the white body politic . <p> Immigration to South Africa peaked in the period 1965 to 1975 when 300,000 new immigrants arrived from Europe. 44 In addition , around 100,000 whites arrived from elsewhere in Africa ( primarily Mozambique and Zimbabwe ) . In the following ten years , a further 174,000 European immigrants arrived in South Africa . The first signs that South Africa had become a seriously undesirable destination occurred during the political turmoil and states of emergency in the mid-1980s . During the first half of the decade , almost 100,000 Europeans immigrated to the country ; in the second , only 28,000 . The number fell to 19,000 between 1991 and 1995 . Certainly , the National Party government did not change its domestic policy during the 1980s ; if anything , whites were more welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned potential immigrants in other directions. 45 <p> The South African elections of 1994 marked a potential watershed in immigration policy . South Africa was welcomed back into the world fold and quickly reintegrated economically into global circuits of production and trade . After a symbolic dalliance with redistributive politics , the ruling party adopted a neo-liberal economic platform whose primary pillar was complete openness to foreign investment. 46 Multi-nationals that had withdrawn during the sanctions era flooded back and South African companies began an aggressive African and global market push . Other signifiers of the post-1994 globalization of South Africa included a dramatic growth in temporary visitors to the country . All this might indicate the necessity for a new openness to skilled people from the continent and abroad . On the contrary , the reverse happened. 47 <p> The figures are stark . Immigration to South Africa , which had been declining in the 1980s , plummeted in the 1990s . <p> Particularly noteworthy is the decline in immigration from Europe to less than 2,000 a year during the late 1990s . But Europe was not the only source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of African immigrants to South Africa had also fallen since 1994 . One might argue that the fall in European immigration is due to a drying up on the supply side , although this would be pure conjecture . The same certainly can not be said of Asia and , particularly , Africa . In other words , at a time when South Africa was opening up to the world and to the continent , it appears to have been more and more difficult for smiled people from other countries to immigrate to the country . <p> There is a globalization-related argument that says that immigration and emigration are of secondary importance to the enhanced mobility of temporary smiled personnel. 48 The obvious corollary to this argument in the South African case is that there should have been a significant increase in the number of temporary work permits issued to non-nationals since 1994 . In fact , while the number of work permits did initially increase after 1994 , the numbers quickly declined . So too did the numbers of work permits renewed ( Table 4 ) . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in freefall since the advent of democratic rule in South Africa in 1994 . The finding is completely counterintuitive and at sharp odds with the economic rationality of globalization . It also compounds the net effect of the brain drain to five of South Africa 's major global competitors . <p> There are several common explanations for these new post-apartheid restrictions toward skilled immigration . One argument promulgated in government itself is that South Africa , unlike the industrialized nations , fully recognizes the impact of the brain drain on the political stability and economic vitality of developing countries . To raid their fragile skills base is to undermine development and destroy southern solidarity . Therefore , South Africa takes the moral high ground and refuses to be complicit in the draining of precious skills both from its poorer neighbors and from farther afield . The case of the Cuban doctors gives some support to this argument . Rather than strip Zimbabwe of its medical health professionals , it was argued at the time , South Africa entered into a bilateral agreement with Cuba to supply Cuban doctors on short-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zimbabwean doctors and nurses have simply left for other places , particularly the United Kingdom . In other words , South Africa 's principled stand has benefited neither South Africa , Zimbabwe nor the region . <p> A second argument , heard more often in business circles , simply blames government ineptitude and bureaucratic bungling. 50 Such a view is premised on the experience that many companies have had with the Home Affairs bureaucracy ( responsible for immigration ) . However , this assigns blame to the wrong place . The Aliens Control Act of 1991 ( the last piece of apartheid immigration legislation ) was designed to tighten control , not facilitate entry . Its archaic and cumbersome procedures would make it difficult for even the most efficient of bureaucracies to speed entry . However , provisions do exist for legal immigration , and the dramatic decline in immigration and migration since 1994 can not be accounted for purely in terms of the legislation . <p> Third , some people have assumed that the antiimmigrationism of the period has been primarily a function of the fact that the African National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The minister of home affairs , Dr. Mangosutho Buthelezi , was the leader of a more conservative opposition party in the national unity government . To dictate policy to him would undermine his authority and could lead to a recurrence of the violence in the Kwazulu-Natal province , his traditional Zulu support base. 51 However , the view that Buthelezi was primarily responsible for the new restrictionism did not account for the fact that in eight years of government , the ANC had failed to formulate its own definitive immigration policy . Indeed , there is evidence to suggest that Buthelezi 's restrictionism sat well with many in the ruling party. 52 THE EXCLUSIONS OF NATION-BUILDING <p> Apartheid and pre-apartheid nation-building projects were racially exclusive , explicitly precluding the majority of inhabitants of national territory from participation in the social , political and symbolic life of the whites-only nation . In 1994 , citizenship was extended to all South African-born and naturalized residents of national territory . South African nationalism became racially inclusive for the first time . The new state embarked on an aggressive nation-building project designed to heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national consciousness with which all South Africans could identify . The success of this project is a matter of some debate , but it is clear that it has had a profound impact on the ( re ) making of inherited immigration policy. 53 <p> The post-apartheid nation-building project clouded thinking about the potential role of immigration in post-apartheid society for at least three reasons . First , the relevance of immigration as a social engineering tool of white domination and supremacy fell away in 1994 . With democracy , the traditional rationale for immigration ( attracting immigrants to bolster white numbers ) was irrelevant . In addition , the new state wished to distance itself from the racially sullied history of immigrant selection of the apartheid era . It did so by immediately declaring immigration amnesties for black South African residents from neighboring states who were in the country without proper or adequate documentation . Between 1994 and 1999 , more than 300,000 undocumented migrants , contract miners and ex-refugees were given legal standing in South Africa in three separate amnesties . No plans were developed for the integration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood of further amnesties. 54 <p> Second , a powerful counter-discourse emerged in which all non-citizen residents are not only excluded from , but also increasingly identified as a threat to , the rights and interests of citizens. 55 Dominating all policy discussions and media representations of immigration to South Africa has been the idea that South Africa is under threat from the outside and within . The rhetorical construction of the illegal alien as the source of many post-apartheid ills has been powerful and all-pervasive. 56 Although relatively few South Africans have any first-hand contact with non-South Africans in the country , most exhibit very high levels of intolerance and hostility toward all outsiders. 57 The fundamental problem here is that issues of exclusion and control so dominated the debate that for the rest of the 1990s it was virtually impossible to mount a rational argument that some forms of in-migration might be beneficial to the South African economy . The 1997 Draft Green Paper on International Migration , for example , developed a strong case for a new skills-based immigration policy . The initial government reaction to this proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an insecure and unprecedented nation-building project tends to produce both insularity and exclusivity. 59 The " rainbow nation " was multi-colored but had very well defined and impermeable edges. 60 Those who leave are traitors and there is little room for those who wish to come . The new South African constitution guaranteeing freedom of movement and exit means that little can be done , beyond fulmination and finger pointing , to stop those who wish to leave . Globalization and the voracious appetite of the industrial world for South African skills ensure that there is a range of quite desirable havens on offer . However , there is clearly a considerable slills pool in other countries that is extremely interested in making South Africa a temporary or permanent home . The " Alberta option " has therefore always been a feasible and low-cost alternative : counter brain drain with a commensurate brain gain from elsewhere . In light of the massive existing and future skills loss from the country , the pattern of post-apartheid immigration is therefore an important indicator of the perceived viability of this strategy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite for immigration at the highest levels of the South African government . In speech after speech following the 1994 elections , Home Affairs Minister Buthelezi made it very clear that he regarded the South African labor market as a zero-sum game. 61 In other words , every job occupied by a non-South African was one less job for a citizen . A responsible policy should therefore ensure that outsiders were kept out of the local labor market . Independent research suggesting that the formula was a great deal more complicated and that small-business immigrants were actually creating employment for South Africans was so at odds with this new nationalism that it was initially ignored. 62 The Draft Green paper also took issue with this simplistic equation and unsuccessfully pushed for a more open immigration policy. 63 <p> The construction of an anti-immigrationist climate , in which all forms of immigration were conceived as harmful to the interests of newly enfranchised citizens , was considerably furthered by South Africa 's undocumented migration problem. 64 After 1990 , with the reopening of South Africa to the world and to the continent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this traffic was from neighboring countries such as Lesotho , Mozambique and Zimbabwe . However , the growth of a visible Francophone African community , the presence of refugees from crisis-torn parts of the continent and the obvious globalization of visitors to the country prompted a major moral panic. 65 Overzealous officials and an irresponsible media reported that illegal aliens-who were causing the country 's escalating crime wave and depriving citizens of resources and services-were swamping the country. 66 Outlandish numbers in the millions were cited , based on a since discredited survey by the state-funded Human Sciences Research Council. 67 <p> On the ground , the police implemented search and deport tactics that strongly resembled the old apartheid pass laws of the pre-1986 period. 68 Large numbers of migrants and citizens were swept into the police dragnet . Tens of thousands were deported every year ( over 1 million between 1994 and 2002 ) . The police campaign , which has been widely condemned by human rights organizations , was represented as a major contribution to fighting crime and the influx of carriers of disease. 69 Violent xenophobic incidents began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pervasive and growing. 70 While the South African Human Rights Commission called for government public education campaigns and started a public " Roll Back Xenophobia " program , the state was largely silent on the issue. 71 <p> At what point , it might be asked , might globalization and the accompanying brain drain from South Africa subvert a narrow nationalistic vision that is at best indifferent and at worst actively hostile to immigration ? In the late 1990s , one could detect the first glimmers of a shift in the tenor of the minister of home affairs ' approach to the skills issue . Public speeches began to make reference to a potential skills crisis . Local and foreign chambers of business were primarily responsible for this shift in thinking with their continual litany of complaints about the existing policy . Business think tanks pressed the idea that the country was already in the grip of a serious skills crisis and that it should throw open the doors to skilled persons from abroad. 72 <p> The eventual result , following five years of discussion , was a new immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill amounted , in the view of its ANC critics , to a virtual removal of the immigration function from the Department of Home Affairs to an INS-like body and to the privatization of immigrant selection , allowing the market to decide who was needed , in what quantities and for how long . The state would simply rubber-stamp the decisions of the private sector . The substance of the bill outraged many in the ANC . At successive stages , first in cabinet and then in parliament , the bill was stripped of its core provisions and mechanisms . At the eleventh hour , the ANC also demanded that state-determined quotas be added to the legislation to control the numbers of skilled people likely to come to the country . The net result , in 2002 , is the promulgation of a deeply flawed Immigration Act to replace the Aliens Control Act. 73 Perhaps the best that can be said is that it accurately reflects the current position of a government caught between the appeal of a narrow nationalist vision and the reality of a new global skills market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the brain drain as profoundly damaging to their economic and development prospects . Scarce skills are creamed off from the economy , and the public sector ( particularly education and health ) is subverted . The result is a destabilization of national economies , a growth in poverty , reduced access to essential services and , in turn , a considerable challenge to the ability of states to govern . These negative impacts are partly offset by the fact that many migrants from developing countries retain strong ties with their home countries and inject sizable infusions of commodities and cash through goods transfers and remittances . However , while many disagree about dimensions and impacts , none has seriously argued that the brain drain is a positive development for those unable to hold on to their skilled personnel in a global marketplace. 74 <p> Clearly one of the options open to skills raiders is to develop their own training capacity to the fullest and not to take the easier Alberta option . Bilateral skills exchange programs , such as those proposed and operated by diaspora network programs , could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater awareness of the negative impacts of skills raiding on those lower down the ladder , as well as a serious commitment to doing something about it . There is a self-interested argument that also might be marshaled a little more frequently against skills raiding . If the economies and public service of fragile Southern polities are driven under by the loss of skilled personnel , the north will have further humanitarian disasters on its hands and will have to confront even greater movements of the undocumented in search of a livelihood . The north can not blithely help itself to the best of the rest of the world without being aware of the implications for illegal migration to its shores . <p> Developing countries , such as South Africa , face a considerable dilemma . The country is a prime target for skills raiders from Europe , North America and Australasia . Research within South Africa shows a skilled population that is deeply uneasy about its present and future prospects . It does not take much , and certainly not all-expenses paid junkets to the Rockies , to turn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The post-1990 brain drain is beginning to bite and the natural response might have been to turn north and east , to cherry pick in the rest of Africa and in Asia . Economic rationality , including the government 's neo-liberal GEAR economic program , demands as much . But ignoring the clamor from local and foreign business interests in the country , the state has firmly set its face in the opposite direction . <p> This is sometimes packaged as a moral decision in which South Africa refuses to take from others what it has lost itself . This argument lacks conviction . The primary reason for the failure of South Africa to develop any kind of pro-active skilled immigration or migration policy lies outside the economic and moral realm . South Africa 's epochal political shift of the 1990s brought all citizens into the political and cultural life of the new nation for the first time . The redefinition of South African nationhood has been accompanied by an aggressive , inclusive nation-building project that has attempted to build a new national identity and to bridge the divides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a profoundly spatial project. 76 The reintegration of the fragmented spaces of the apartheid homeland policy into a single , unified federal state has inevitably hardened the perception of national borders as the frontiers of South African nationhood . Those deemed to lie outside those borders or to originate from beyond them have been redefined as outsiders . This even includes many blacks who had found common cause with black South Africans in the fight against apartheid. 77 <p> South Africa has a long history of periods of intense nation-building and strong anti-immigrationism . In every case , the logic of immigration eventually softened and subverted isolationism . While it would be invidious to suggest that the post-apartheid nation-building project is founded on the same values as its predecessors , there is no a priori reason why the anti-immigrationism since 1994 should not also run aground on the rocks of economic logic . In this case , the process is likely to be hastened by the ineluctable forces of globalization , skills raiding and the brain drain of South African professionals . In the last two years there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in government that South Africa 's future prosperity may depend on temporary skills import .
