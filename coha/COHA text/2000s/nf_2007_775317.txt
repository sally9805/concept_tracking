The Sweetest Con of All // Anthony Dwight Stone was perfectly happy being Anthony Dwight Stone , for all of his first thirty-one years . This sense of contentment continued right up until the day , a few years ago , when he learned that Thomas Earl Batts had decided to also become Anthony Dwight Stone , and the world got a little too crowded . // The real Anthony Stone was driving through Nash County , North Carolina , when he was stopped for speeding . When his license was inspected , the police gave him the news that he was wanted for drug possession . Geez , he said , they had to be kidding . They weren ? t , and he got tossed in jail for the night . Then the police showed him a picture that was supposedly him . It was of a man with his hair coiled in braids and a stomach that ran on forever who easily weighed three hundred pounds ; Stone boasted curly hair and weighed 170 , tops . He recognized the man right away . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Being his sister ? s boyfriend had made it pretty easy for Batts to gather the necessary information  --  Social Security number and a few other key facts  --  and slip into Anthony Stone ? s identity . And it certainly changed Anthony Stone ? s view of what sisters are for . // As it turned out , Stone said , Batts had quietly appropriated Stone ? s identity some ten years earlier and had been living right alongside him , using credit cards in Stone ? s name to buy various necessary and unnecessary merchandise . He had gone and gotten a loan in Stone ? s name to purchase a house . And out of force of bad habit , he had built up a tidy little rap sheet . // None of this was a good thing for Anthony Stone . Batts , for instance , didn ? t bother to keep current with his credit . But then , what did he care ? He wasn ? t really Anthony Stone . And so the real Anthony Stone found himself branded as a congenital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any credit . " Doors of all kind were shut in my face , " he said . He ? d apply for a job and would be promptly turned down ; once he found work and , after a lagging credit check , was whisked right out of a company car . // When he belatedly got around to applying to college , he got nothing but rejections , since his sketchy credit and criminal misdeeds weren ? t quite what the admissions people had in mind for their incoming class . It didn ? t seem to matter that it was n't his credit record or his criminal record . " I ? d get into my apartment and get a notice six or seven times that I was evicted , " he said . " I felt like life had stopped . " // It took years to untangle the mess . And Anthony Stone had to wonder , what if it happened again ? Which is why he went to court and changed his name to Stone Tyler , essentially ceding his old identity to the dustbin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Social Security number . He was laughed at and told it couldn ? t be done , but he ultimately did get it done . " Basically , you can ? t get your Social Security number changed unless it ? s life-threatening , " he said . // Tyler , who lives in Durham , North Carolina , at last got into college and found a job with Blue Cross Blue Shield . Batts served a brief jail sentence , and that was it . For many people , the metamorphosis that Stone Tyler chose  --  new name , new Social Security number  --  might seem like an extreme response to an admittedly awful situation , and I wouldn ? t recommend going quite that far . But from where he sat he saw no choice . This con was just too much for him . // His rude ordeal taught this young man , who had been leading an unremarkable life in North Carolina , that he lived in a new world in which all identities are at risk and , in essence , are in play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this one was going to be the sweetest of all . For the past thirty-two years , ever since forsaking my foolish teenage infatuation with perpetrating swindles , I ? ve been a professional expert in how to prevent fraud . Nearly twenty years ago , as I was busy trying to help banks and businesses stop the spiraling increase in rubber checks and wily embezzlement schemes , it became obvious to me that a brand-new fraud , still in its formative stages and without even a clarifying name , was destined to overwhelm all the others as the clear crime of choice . In fact , it was a crook ? s dream come true , the sort of surefire caper that makes a career criminal glad he ignored his mother ? s advice and picked the wrong side of the law . // Years before , I would never have guessed that it could even be invented , for it was the most incredible but also the simplest crime ever perpetrated . And if I manage to live forty more years , it will remain the simplest crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festering crime is what we now know as identity theft , the wholesale lifting of someone ? s identity for illicit gain . It ? s stealing that identity , then using it to access a person ? s bank account , their personal information , and their personal finances . It ? s becoming someone else for the bucks . // Why did I think it contained such enormous promise for thieves ? First of all , it is elementary to pull off . If you have my name , my date of birth , and my Social Security number , that ? s pretty much all you need in order to become me . It takes very little investment capital . A phone and a cheap computer will get you started . If you want to write phony checks , you ? ll need a few vital tools like a blow-dryer , cake pans , and a common household chemical . You can pick them up at your nearest discount drugstore , and no one will be the wiser . // Then , the rewards are enormous . Identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s wallet and bank account but to his very life and character , his entire ability to borrow and spend . Are you worried about the law ? No need . Technology has made identity theft easy to execute behind the shadowy cloak of a computer keyboard . You don ? t even have to be in the same city , or country , as your victim . You can steal someone ? s identity without being able to speak his language or pronounce her name . // Moreover , law enforcement cares less about identity theft than it does about double-parked cars and public loiterers . Your chances of getting caught are minuscule . But even if you do get caught , you are unlikely to spend a single night in jail . Swiping a kid ? s bike might have graver consequences . // When I ran all these things through my mind , they unnerved me to no end . And my long-dormant criminal instincts stirred a little and made me think , Why didn ? t they invent this con back when I could have used it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ? s names more than thirty years ago , for example , it took me three months and a million-dollar Heidelberg printing press to create and cash a realistic-looking product . Today criminals do it in an instant on a $500 computer , with no witnesses to pick them out in a lineup , because they ? re doing it from an armchair in China or Russia , a continent away . And checks are simply one piece of an identity thief ? s arsenal . // In recent years identity theft has become the very monster I feared it would become . It ? s a crime so versatile that the list of potential targets is endless . Who ? s at risk ? Anyone who has a credit card or a bank account , or who pays a bill . Anyone who has a mortgage , a car loan , or a debit card . Anyone who has a driver ? s license , a Social Security number , or a job . Anyone who has phone service or health insurance . Anyone who goes on the Internet. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like me . People of all ages , all races , all incomes , and both sexes . A thirty-five-year-old New York busboy had the hubris to choose names off the Forbes 400 list , including Ross Perot , Oprah Winfrey , Michael Bloomberg , and Ted Turner , gleaned additional information on them from the Internet , and became them . Robert De Niro ? s identity was assumed by his movie double . Tiger Woods was victimized by a California man who rented a moving truck and a storage locker in his name . In Chandler , Arizona , the identity of the retired police chief was taken over by a woman who loaded up at Wal-Mart and Sam ? s Club stores . Twin brothers were kicked off the popular American Idol show after police said they had bought a car using the stolen identities of two unwitting fans . // In other words , anyone who ? s alive is a potential victim . Actually , I stand corrected  --  even the dead can become targets of this insidious crime . You can have lived your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you ? re still not protected from the long reach of identity thieves . Scam artists have no compunction . After all , the dead rarely complain . // These days you can ? t go to a party or have lunch with three or four people without someone in that group mentioning that he got a phony e-mail , or that his credit card was compromised  --  that somehow someone snatched his identity . Identity theft is the fastest-growing criminal activity in the country ( and it ? s doing awfully well abroad ) . And it could be coming soon to a bank account near you . // Every Four Seconds // Accurate statistics on identity theft are tricky to come by , because it remains an underdocumented crime . Many people and businesses don ? t report incidents to the police , and a startling number of people do n't even know their identities have been stolen . The reported numbers , though , are shocking . // At the time when I wrote my last book , The Art of the Steal , in 2001 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and losses to banks and credit card companies amounted to $5 billion . That ? s not chicken feed , but in 2003 the Federal Trade Commission released the most exhaustive government study to date of identity theft , estimating that there had been 27.3 million victims in the prior five years . In 2004 alone , around 10 million consumers suffered from some variation of identity theft , and losses exceeded $54 billion . In 2005 the FTC was swamped with five thousand calls a week relating to the problem , more than they got on any other issue and triple what they had received just five years before . // When a major insurance company recently polled a sizable sampling of its policyholders on their biggest fears , the number-one response was their fear of losing all their assets through bad stock market and other investments . Number two was their fear of identity theft . Throughout the country people go out of their way to put multiple locks on their doors and install costly silent alarm systems . Well , in a given year , about 2.6 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of them have their identities stolen . In 2005 it ? s believed that an identity was stolen every four seconds . // The crime has universal appeal to criminals , and it ? s happening all over the world . A recent survey conducted in New Zealand by Baycorp Advantage found that one in ten of the 450 Kiwis questioned said that they had been the victim of identity theft . // The crime has become so mainstream that comedians have begun joking about it , always a tip-off that it ? s time to worry . Andy Borowitz , a humor columnist , quipped recently that a thief who rounded up a half-million identities returned all but four of them because the other 499,996 were " totally worthless . " Identity thieves , he said , were getting awfully sick of this , feeling it only fair that financial institutions clearly flag deadbeat identities so that crooks don ? t have to waste their valuable time . // I ? ll Tell You Twenty-two Things Overnight // In my entire career I have never encountered a crime as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason is that so much personal information is widely and publicly available , there for anyone to take . Once upon a time criminals used to have to really work to make an illegal living . Back when I was passing bad checks , if you wanted to lift information on someone ? s identity , you had to penetrate so much bureaucracy that it almost wasn ? t worth the headache . You had to go down to the county records department and try to cadge information , or try to get at boating records and mortgage information by cajoling low-level civil service workers . It could be done , but it took know-how and talent , plus you had to do it in person , producing witnesses . Now rank amateurs can do it , with technology ? s helping hand . An identity thief can acquire everything needed to steal your life by going online for less than thirty minutes . If he ? s in a big rush and has a high-speed Internet hookup , fifteen might suffice . Getting someone ? s supposedly secure information is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regularly teach agents at the FBI Academy , and one little demonstration I do is to ask one of my students for his address . Nothing more , not even his name . By the following morning I ? m able to hand over to him twenty-two pieces of so-called " private " information about him , including his Social Security number , birth date , salary , current bank and account numbers , mother ? s maiden name , children ? s names , spouse ? s name and Social Security number , and neighbors . I can even reveal who lives with him in his house but isn ? t related to him . And I don ? t even have to do something as dramatic as hack into a bank database . All this information is readily available from publicly accessible sources on the Internet , and you or Joe Criminal can get it as easily as I did . Imagine how much I could have found out about the guy if I had decided to break the law ! // Just this past year a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to send him a card , but I couldn ? t remember the exact date . So I logged on to the Web and went to the Texas Public Health Records , because I knew he had been born in Texas , and typed in his name . Up came the city and county he was born in , as well as his mother ? s maiden name , his date of birth , and on and on , all the information right there online for free . // Consider these sobering facts : // * Six out of ten American companies and government agencies have already been hacked . // * An estimated 80 percent of birth certificate requests are fulfilled through the mail for people using only a name and a return address . So I could take your name , use my address , and get your birth certificate . From there I ? m off to the races . // * Americans write 39 billion checks a year , and half of these folks never reconcile their bank statements . // * A Social Security number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s license goes for $90 . A birth certificate will set you back $79. // In today ? s hotly competitive financial marketplace , speed is of the essence . Thieves love fast credit approval , because haste is the enemy of accuracy . Credit card issuers , for their part , can be very sloppy in doling out cards , failing to match Social Security numbers and dates of birth and otherwise failing to take basic precautions in their eagerness to get cards in circulation . Issuers say their screening is tighter than ever , but dead people , one-year-old babies , and dogs of varying ages still find themselves offered preapproved cards . ( I imagine a few turtles and some parakeets have gotten them as well . ) A Livermore , California , man signed up for an e-mail account in his dog ? s name , expanding it to Clifford J. Dog . Sure enough , in short order Clifford got a preapproved credit card application . As a lark , the owner filled it out . Pugsy Malone was listed as the mother ? s name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000-00-0000 . Then he wrote that this was for a dog , please don ? t send a card . Naturally , the card came . // In fact , it ? s now child ? s play to assume someone ? s identity . Suppose you go to the grocery store and write a check for $52 . The check bears your full name and address and maybe your phone number to boot . It also has the full name and address of the bank where the check is drawn and your account number . Maybe the clerk asks to see your driver ? s license . The clerk might jot down the license number ( in nine states , that could still be your Social Security number ) and even your date of birth . // Hundreds of people , from the grocery store clerk to check-clearing house employees , will see this check . Then it goes back to the payee bank . If you don ? t get your checks in your statement , they go to a company that shreds them  --  and even there they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s just one way thieves can get virtually all the vital information they need . // To prove a point a few years ago , the California-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights went on the Internet and bought the Social Security numbers and home addresses of the CIA director , the attorney general , and the FTC chairman . It cost them $26 . Sounds like a steal to me. //
