Are American forces truly getting any closer to finding Osama bin Laden ? Two weeks ago , Lieut . Colonel Bryan Hilferty , U.S. military spokesman in Afghanistan , raised hopes when he boldly announced he was " sure " bin Laden would be captured by the end of the year . His statement also prompted the inevitable speculation during an election year that the Bush Administration was somehow trying to orchestrate an October surprise : namely , the capture of the terrorist mastermind just before voters go to the polls in November . <P> In fact , military sources in Afghanistan tell TIME , Hilferty 's statement was not based on concrete new information . But it did reflect a sense of rising optimism fueled in part by the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and in part by recent data gathering . A knowledgeable U.S. intelligence official tells TIME that a recent spike in intelligence has given government officials greater reason for hope than at any time since bin Laden escaped U.S. clutches in Tora Bora at the end of 2001 . " There are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declining to give details for fear they might " dry up . " He adds , " There are a lot of people very confident that they have him narrowed to a certain sector . " That sector probably encompasses several hundred square miles along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border , which is not exactly like having him cooped up in your backyard . Nor would this be the first time that hopes of bin Laden 's imminent capture have risen , only to lead to disappointment . So no one , either in Washington or Afghanistan , is getting too giddy . Tracking bin Laden , the intelligence official says , is " kind of like trying to grab Jell-O before it solidifies . " <P>  --  By Timothy J. Burger and Tim McGirk
