<p> In 1978 , while covering California politics , I found myself on election night at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles , which was serving as a kind of election central . Waiting for the returns to come in , I was sitting in the lobby having a drink with my father  --  who , then as now , was the leading expert on Ronald Reagan . As iron cue , the former actor and ex-California governor came striding into the hotel . Even then Reagan looked the part : wide-shouldered , flanked by a security detail , sporting his trademark blue serge suit , every black hair in place . <p> The only thing missing , I thought , was the Marine Corps Band . <p> No one back east took Reagan nearly as seriously as he seemed to be taking himself . Despite a devoted following among what were then known as Goldwater Republicans , the Washington cognoscenti casually dismissed Reagan as too conservative , too old , a B-movie actor who once played second fiddle to a chimpanzee- " Who does he think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The president of the United States ? " <p> " No " came the reply . " He thinks he 's the next president of the United States " After a pause , he added , " And he might be . " <p> I remember that vignette every time a political sage says authoritatively that Hillary Rodham Clinton will " never " be president . <p> This is a particularly entrenched bit of conventional wisdom , which seems to have metastasized into a kind of secret handshake . If you " know " Clinton ca n't be president , you 're a member of the Washington in-crowd , If you do n't , you 're an outsider , some boob from the sticks of , I do n't know , Sacramento or somewhere . Suburban Chicago , maybe . You know the rap : She 's too liberal , too polarizing , a feminist too threatening to male voters . Too much baggage . Too . Clinton . <p> And these are Democrats talking . Bizarrely , the party 's insiders are going out of their way to tear down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conservative columnist Robert Novak van into this phenomenon recently while speaking to eight local Democratic politicians in Los Angeles . Novak told them matter-of-factly that Hillary was the odds-on favorite to be their party 's 2008 nominee  --  and that no one was in second place . Novak was surprised by their reaction : Not one was for Mrs. Clinton . Why ? " They think she is a loser , " said one of the Democrats . <p> With some exceptions , the journalistic pack seems nearly as negative about Hillary Clinton 's chances . I 'm a charter member of an informal lunch group of writers who runs the gamut from conservative to liberal , and each month when we meet , Hillary 's name arises . Around the table it goes : She ca n't be elected in a general election ; men are n't willing to vote for a woman like Hillary ; women do n't think much of her marriage  --  or her , for staying in it ; which red state could she possibly carry ? What swing voter would she convince ? Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's candidacy until finally I began sparing my friends the whole rap by just noting  --  for the minutes of the meeting , as it were  --  that I disagree with them . <p> Perhaps my lunch mates , those worried activist Democrats , and the majority of Washington pundits are correct . But I do n't think so . <p> They certainly were n't right about Reagan . <p> Conservatives ( and liberals ) would consider it heresy to compare Ronald Reagan and Hillary Clinton . And Reagan is certainly a hard act to follow . He combined Main Street sensibilities and a soothing Middle America persona with an uplifting vision of America 's place in the world that earned him a stunningly decisive victory in 1980  --  and 60 percent of the vote when he ran for reelection four years later . Sen. Clinton is a more polarizing figure , in more polarized times . Yet Clinton , like Reagan , can lay claim to the passions of diehard grassroots members of her party . With the exception of incumbents and vice presidents , no candidate since Reagan has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this long before the election . And like Reagan , the charisma gap between her and any would-be challengers in her own party is palpable . <p> Of course , the question is not whether she can win in the primary . Most Democrats concede the primary is probably hers for the taking . " I do n't know how you beat her for the Democratic nomination , " former Sen. Bob Kerrey New York magazine . ' " She 's a rock staff But that , as the cognoscenti see it , is the problem . She ca n't lose the primary , and she ca n't win the general election . And so they look vainly for an alternative  --  Warner ? Biden ? Bayh ? Oh my !  --  always circling back to the same despairing fear of another four years in the political wilderness . Democrats have raised this kind of defeatism to a high art . But it 's time for Democrats to snap out of it and take a fresh look at the hand they 've been dealt . Hillary Rodham Clinton can win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Democrats just might be holding aces . Poll positioned <p> The available data do not suggest she is unelectable  --  they suggest just the opposite . A Gallup poll done a week before Memorial Day showed Sen. Clinton with a favorable rate of 55 percent . True , her unfavorable number is 39 percent , which is high enough for concern  --  but one that is nearly identical to Bush 's on the eve of his reelection . And the unfavorable rating registered by Republican contender Bill Frist was nearly as high as his favorable numbers , with 32 percent saying they 'd never heard of him . <p> " Then there was this eye-opening question : <p> If Hillar Rodham Clinton were to run for president in 2008 , how likely would you be to vote for her  --  very likely , somewhat likely , not very likely , or not at all likely ? TABLE <p> At the risk of laboring the point , 29 percent plus 24 percent adds up to a majority . I can hear my pals answering this as they read these numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack machine gets a hold of her . " <p> Well , no , it is n't . They 've been going at her with verbal tire irons , machetes , and sawed-off shotguns for 12 years now . Sen. Clinton 's negatives are already figured into her ratings . What could she be accused of that she has n't already confronted since she entered the public eye 14 years ago ? Clinton today is in a position similar to Bush 's at the beginning of 2004 . Democrats hoped that more information about the president 's youth would " knock him down . But voters had already taken the president 's past into account when they voted for him in 2000 . More information just was n't going to make a dent . In fact , as the spring of 2005 turned to summer there were yet another book and a matched spate of tabloid broadsides , ha the face of it all , Hillary appears , if anything , to be getting stronger . Indeed , the more the right throws at her , the easier it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the professional Clinton bashers . <p> Let 's also look deeper into that Gallup survey because the closer you look at it , the more formidable Sen. Clinton seems . Thirty percent of the poll 's respondents consider Hillary a " moderate , " while 9 percent described her a " conservative " Now , I 'm not sure which newspapers that 9 percent have been reading ( the Daily Worker ? ) , but the fact that nearly 40 percent of the electorate does not identify her as liberal mitigates the perception that she 's considered too far to the left to be a viable national candidate . <p> Such perceptions are hardly set in stone , however , and senators ' voting records can come back to haunt them in the heat of a campaign as John Kerry learned in 2004 and countless others have learned before him . It 's no accident that the last sitting US. senator elected president was John F. Kennedy . Thus , Clinton 's Senate voting record , and where it puts her on the ideological scale , is worth some additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records is undertaken by my magazine , National Journal , which for 2004 used 24 votes on economic issues , 19 votes on social issues , and 17 foreign policy-related roll calls to rate all 100 US. senators . Its resulting ranking of John Kerry as the Senate 's most liberal member ( at least during 2003 ) was a gift from on high for the Bush campaign , and the Massachusetts senator spent the better part of his campaign trying to explain away this vote or that . But Sen. Clinton is harder to pigeon-hole . For 2004 , Clinton 's composite liberal score was 71 percent  --  putting her roughly in the middle of the Democratic caucus . While adhering to her party 's liberal dogma on issues such as race , gun control , and judicial appointees , Hillary lists slightly toward the center on economic issues , and even more so on national security and foreign-policy issues . There 's no telling at this point how the war in Iraq will play in 2008 , but one thing is certain : Sen. Clinton wo n't struggle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one not authorizing the $87 billion to pay for it . For better or worse , she voted " aye " both times . <p> Yet another piece of received Washington wisdom holds that the party could never nominate someone in 2008 who has supported the Iraq war . Perhaps . But history suggests that if Bush 's mission in Iraq flounders , a politician as nimble as Clinton will have plenty of time to get out in front of any anti-war movement . If it succeeds , Hillary would have demonstrated the kind of steadfastness demanded by the soccer morns turned security morns with whom Bush did so well in 2004 . <p> On domestic issues , Sen. Clinton has also shown a willingness to step out of the safety zone . She is bolstering her bipartisan credentials by teaming up with Republicans from the other side of the aisle , such as Lindsey Graham and Frist himself , making her more difficult to portray as some kind of radical . And while her liberal voting record on social issues remains intact , she has taken rhetorical steps toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January speech in Albany , in which she advised abortion-rights activists to seek " common ground . with people on the other side . " While pledging to defend Roe v. Wade , Mrs. Clinton relented to abortion as a " sad , even tragic , act " and called on Democrats to embrace a moral language for discussing the issue . Some conservatives even seemed receptive . In some quarters , Hillary 's centrist posture was portrayed as new ; but it actually is n't : She butted heads with the Arkansas teachers ' union in the mid-1980s over a proposal she led to improve teacher quality . <p> The abortion speech was reminiscent of her husband 's 1992 campaign-trail criticism of Sister Souljah for advocating violence against white people . Her remarks simultaneously showed she was willing to talk common sense to a key Democratic interest group while putting herself in sync with the ambivalent sensibilities most Americans have toward abortion . And because of the high standing she enjoys among Democratic women , she was able to do it without any fear of liberal backlash . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discusses abortion in the way she has , it : causes people to sit up and take notice . <p> Which brings us to the ultimate question : Hillary 's gender . Will Americans vote for a woman ? <p> They certainly say they will : 74 percent told Gallup that they 'd be either " somewhat " or " very " likely to vote for a woman in 2008 . This number is actually on the low side compared to polls from the pre-Hillary era , for the obvious reason that Clinton casts a shadow over 2008 , and many of the respondents are Republicans who plan to vote against her . Again , I can hear some of my friends murmuring that these voters are n't telling the truth . But that 's precisely the kind of snobbish thinking that never gets Democrats anywhere , that is usually wrong , and that infuriates swing voters . My advice to my Democratic friends is to ignore your inner elitist , and trust the American people to tell the truth , and , moreover , to do the right thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , as they 've been proving their willingness to pull the lever for female candidates for a long time . In 1999 , when Hillary first entered the national scene , 56 women sat in the House of Representatives , and nine in the Senate . Only three women were governors , but many women were in the pipeline in state government : Nearly 28 percent of statewide elective offices in the country were occupied by women . In one state , Arizona , women held the top five statewide offices . And that pipeline produced . Six years later , there are 14 women in the Senate , and 66 in the House ( along with another three non-voting delegates ) . There are eight , not three , women governors . " The day will come when men will recognize woman as his peer , not only at the fireside , but in councils of the nation , " Susan B. Anthony once predicted . That day is fast approaching whether or not conservatives are ready for it , and whether or not liberals are willing to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the American electorate is ready for a female president ( and this particular female candidate ) must at some point confront the Electoral College map . This , my skeptical friends claim , is where Hillary 's hopes runs aground . Putting it plainly , they challenge anyone to come up with a red state that Hillary can carry  --  someplace , anyplace , where Sen. Clinton could run stronger than the Kerry/Edwards ticket . <p> It is , of course , absurd to look at electoral politics at such an atomic level this far out . In due time , pollsters and the press will christen 2008 's must-have swing voters and must-win swing states . But calibrating a candidacy to the last election is a fool 's errand . The near-frozen electoral map of the last five years has been an historical anomaly , not the rule . So there 's no reason to believe that a 2004 electoral map would be terribly useful three years hence . <p> But if we must , let 's play along . What red state could Clinton snatch away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers itself part of New York anyway , and Clinton 's moderate overtures might draw swing voters from upstate . Cuban Americans are no longer the sole Latino voting bloc in Florida  --  and even Cubans are no longer monolithic . If not Florida , how about Iowa and New Mexico ? They are centrist , bellwether states  --  and states Hillary 's husband carried both times he ran . Meanwhile , the Republican Party hardly has a lock on Ohio , which went for Clinton twice , and which was close in 2000 and 2004 . <p> The fact is , there are a thousand movable parts in a presidential campaign , but the two most indispensable are ( 1 ) a candidate with charisma , money , and a broad following in his or her party ; and ( 2 ) a ticket that espouses values and policies that Middle Americans agree with . A candidate , the polls now suggest , like Hillary Clinton . <p> Or John McCain . The Bubba factor <p> After dissecting an upcoming race , any good horse player will look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ) missed anything : Who could beat the obvious horse ? For the 2008 presidential run , there is an answer that jumps off the page : If the Republican faithful are smart enough to nominate him , John Sydney McCain III would probably be their most formidable candidate  --  if he gets the GOP nomination , a big " if . " <p> It 's fanciful to suggest that anyone is unbeatable this far out , even McCain . While he makes the media swoon , the Arizona senator would have to thread a pretty tight needle to get to the White House . A Quinnipiac Poll taken in March showed a McCain-Clinton election virtually tied , 43-41 . These are good numbers , but they 're hardly in the Colin Powell range . The Republican conservative base remains leery of him . That this antipathy is self-defeating ( or even inexplicable ) makes it no less real . In addition , the easiest circumstances to envision that would benefit McCain would be if there were widespread disillusion with Bush . But the issue most likely to bring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  probably does n't help McCain anyway : If anything , he 's been more hawkish on foreign policy than the president . Even if other factors  --  a rotten economy or a scandal  --  led to a McCain general election candidacy ; a GOP meltdown might carry McCain to the nomination , but it would n't help him against Hillary Clinton . First , if conservatives could muster only halfhearted passion for the man , ( not unlike the less-than-enthusiastic support John Kerry received from many Democrats ) well , we 've seen that movie . No candidate is without vulnerabilities , and certainly Hillary has hers . ( I 'll leave their enumeration to my counterpart , Amy Sullivan . ) The difference between a winning and losing campaign , though , is whether you have the strategy to weather the inevitable rough waters . <p> On the USS George W. Bush , Karl Rove is considered the indispensable navigator . But when one looks on the Democratic side , who is a match for the man Bush called " The Architect " of his triumph ? What recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chessboard 20 moves ahead and plot a winning game plan ? Only one , and to find him , Sen. Clinton need only look to the other side of the breakfast table . <p> President Clinton does n't come without strings attached . While it is an article of faith among the Clintonistas that Al Gore hurt his own campaign in 2000 by not using Bill Clinton more on the stump , there was plenty of polling to back up Gore 's gambit . While Clinton could stir up the party faithful , his presence was n't always a net plus . Hillary faces a similar dilemma when it comes to her husband-and a lot closer to home . But in addition to being able to draw upon Clinton 's strategic gifts , Sen. Clinton would almost certainly not make the more serious mistake Gore made : not being able to successfully make use of the Clinton administration 's record of 22 million new jobs ; steady income growth for workers of every level ; precipitous declines in the welfare rolls ; and an expanded NATO alliance that ushered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the optimism and idealism espoused in 1992 by The Man From Hope , and the way Clinton would parry policy questions with long , coherent , informative answers ? Or will they remember their disgust at the revelations about the infamous blue dress , and how Clinton often shaded the truth ? <p> No repentance , however sincere , could spare Bill Clinton from his eternity as fodder for the tabloids and late-night monologues . But he seems to be growing increasingly sure-footed and confident in his role as elder statesman . He has formed a friendship with the man he defeated for the office , and a productive working relationship with the current president . If he is to help his wife , all Clinton needs to do is remind us of his better angels , as he did during his tour of tsunami-devastated South Asia . <p> This brings us back to Hillary herself . Even if Bill Clinton rises to the occasion , voters are going to remember the yin and the yang of our 42nd president , and they are going to chew on the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . She will be asked about the marriage . How she answers will go a long way toward determining the viability of her candidacy . In his astute book on the Clinton presidency , John F. Harris recounts how aides broached the subject of her marriage as Hillary prepared to run for the Senate . How would she answer this basic question : Why had she stayed with him ? <p> " Yes , I 've been wondering that myself , " Hillary says playfully . <p> Then Bill interjects : " Because you 're a sticker ! That 's what people need to know  --  you 're a sticker . You stick at the things you care about ? ' <p> Clintonites love this story , but there are a couple of things wrong with it . First , Bill Clinton is providing the answer , but it 's not his answer to give . Second , it 's a talking point . The Clintons are good at slogans , but this is a question women will have for Hillary Clinton , women looking to identify with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears that her marriage is a sham , and that she 's an opportunist . On the other hand , if the answer emerges that she loves Bill Clinton , despite his flaws , and that she 's in an imperfect marriage  --  well , most marriages are imperfect . Moreover , if she suggests that the deciding factor was her concern for their daughter , well , that 's the kind of pro-family cred that really matters . Cute answers wo n't cut it . Authenticity will . And there 's every reason to believe both Clintons could summon it when talking about the daughter to whom they are so obviously devoted . <p> Finally , there is one perceived pitfall  --  and that 's Hillary 's penchant for the jugular . Party activists admire her for this , but successful general election candidates learn to temper the instincts that result in outbursts like the " vast , right-wing conspiracy ' In upstate New York , Sen. Clinton has charmed independent Yankee farmers and small-town Republican businessmen from Buffalo with an inclusive , upbeat style of campaigning and governing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she gets going on the red meat circuit Sen. Clinton retains a fondness for ad hominem attacks and paranoid world views . <p> " There has never been an administration , I do n't believe in our history ; more intent upon consolidating and abusing power to further their own agenda , " Clinton said at a recent Democratic fundraiser . " Why ca n't the Democrats do more to stop them ? I can tell you this : It 's very hard to stop people who have no shame about what they 're doing .. It is very hard to stop people who have never been acquainted with the truth ? ' The crowd loved it , but this rant manages to ignore Nixon , while simultaneously sounding Nixonian . Hillary can definitely have a tin ear . <p> Hillary Clinton , whether she realizes it or not , is relieved of the obligation to pander in this way . She has paid her dues to the Democratic Party , and she does n't have to prove her bona tides to anyone . From now on , she only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigned with positive rhetoric and a smile on his face , trusting that the work he 'd done cultivating his base would pay off , and that he needed mainly to reassure independent-minded voters . When we in the press corps tried to bait Reagan into going negative by asking why he 'd abandoned the party of his youth , he invariably smiled , cocked his head , and gave the same line . " I did n't leave the Democratic Party , " Reagan would say . " The Democratic Party left me " <p> As a girl , Hillary Rodham was a Goldwater Republican . She could use the same line in reverse . It might remind swing voters why they are looking , once again , at casting their lot with a candidate named Clinton . She can do this because Democrats are poised to back her already , and because much of the rest of America is watching , open-minded , half-hoping that she gives them a reason to support her , too . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House for National Journal , an authoritative , non-partisan weekly Washington magazine on politics and government . <p>
