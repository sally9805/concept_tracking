ACTORS <br> Matt Sorley , born Mose Sadacca , was an actor . He was a character actor <br> and ( when they let him ) a comedian . He had broad , swarthy , pliant cheeks , a <br> reddish widow 's peak that was both curly and balding , and very bright teeth <br> as big and orderly as piano keys . His stage name had a vaguely Irish sound , <br> but his origins were Sephardic . One grandfather was from Constantinople , the <br> other from Alexandria . His parents could still manage a few words of the old <br> Spanish spoken by the Jews who had fled the Inquisition , but Matt himself , <br> brought up in Bensonhurst , Brooklyn , was purely a New Yorker . The <br> Brooklyn that swarmed in his speech was useful . It got him parts . <br> Sometimes he was recognized in the street a day or so following <br> his appearance on a television lawyer series he was occasionally on call for . <br> These were serious , mostly one-shot parts requiring mature looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in rehearsals . Matt usually <br> played the judge ( three minutes on camera ) or else the father of the murder <br> victim ( seven minutes ) . The good central roles went to much younger men <br> with rich black hair and smooth flat bellies . When they stood up to speak in <br> court , they carefully buttoned up their jackets . Matt could no longer easily <br> button his . He was close to sixty and secretly melancholy . He lived on the <br> Upper West Side in a rent-controlled apartment with a chronic leak under the <br> bathroom sink . He had a reputation for arguing with directors ; one director <br> was in the habit of addressing him , rather nastily , as Mr. Surly . <br> His apartment was littered with dictionaries , phrase books , <br> compendiums of scientific terms , collections of slang , encyclopedias of <br> botany , mythology , history . Frances was the one with the steady income . <br> She worked for a weekly crossword puzzle magazine , and by every Friday <br> had to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> The job kept her confined and furious . She was unfit for deadlines and <br> tension ; she was myopic and suffered from eyestrain . Her neck was long , <br> thin , and imperious , with a jumpy pulse at the side . Matt had met her , right <br> out of Tulsa , almost twenty years ago on the tiny stage of one of those <br> downstairs cellar theaters in the Village  --  the stage was only a clearing in a <br> circle of chairs . It was a cabaret piece , with ballads and comic songs , and <br> neither Matt nor Frances had much of a voice . This common deficiency <br> passed for romance . They analyzed their mutual flaws endlessly over coffee <br> in the grimy little cafe next door to the theater . Because of sparse audiences , <br> the run petered out after only two weeks , and the morning after the last show <br> Matt and Frances walked downtown to City Hall and were married . <br> Frances never sang onstage again . Matt sometimes did , to get <br> laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellars she was calm <br> enough , but in any theater north of Astor Place she faltered and felt a <br> needlelike chill in her breasts and forgot her lines . And yet her brain was all <br> storage . She knew words like " fenugreek , " " kermis , " " sponson , " " gibberellin . " <br> She was angry at being imprisoned by such words . She lived , she said , <br> behind bars ; she was the captive of a grid . All day long she sat fitting letters <br> into squares , scrambling the alphabet , inventing definitions made to resemble <br> conundrums , shading in the unused squares . " Grid and bear it , " she said <br> bitterly , while Matt went out to take care of ordinary household things  --  <br> buying milk , picking up his shirts from the laundry , taking his shoes to be <br> resoled . Frances had given up acting for good . She did n't like being exposed <br> like that , feeling nervous like that , shaking like that , the needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cramp in her bowel . Besides , she <br> was embarrassed about being nearsighted and hated having to put in contact <br> lenses to get through a performance . In the end she threw them in the trash . <br> Off stage , away from audiences , she could wear her big round glasses in <br> peace . <br> Frances resented being , most of the time , the only breadwinner . <br> After four miscarriages she said she was glad they had no children , she <br> could n't imagine Matt as a father  --  he lacked gumption , he had no get-up- <br> and-go . He thought it was demeaning to scout for work . He thought work <br> ought to come to him because he was an artist . He defined himself as <br> master of a Chaplinesque craft ; he had been born into the line of an elite <br> tradition . He scorned props and despised the way some actors relied on <br> cigarettes to move them through a difficult scene , stopping in the middle of a <br> speech to light up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a <br> purist . He was contemptuous of elaborately literal sets , rooms that looked <br> like real rooms . He believed that a voice , the heel of a hand , a hesitation , the <br> widening of a nostril , could furnish a stage . Frances wanted Matt to hustle for <br> jobs , she wanted him to network , bug his agent , follow up on casting calls . <br> Matt could do none of these things . He was an actor , he said , not a goddamn <br> peddler . <br> It was n't clear whether he was actually acting all the time <br> ( Frances liked to accuse him of this ) , yet even on those commonplace <br> daytime errands , there was something exaggerated and perversely open <br> about him : an unpredictability leaped out and announced itself . He kidded <br> with all the store help . At the Korean-owned vegetable stand , the young <br> Mexican who was unpacking peppers and grapefruits hollered across to <br> him , " Hey , Mott , you in a movie now ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> It was four years since his last film offer , a bit part with Marlon Brando , whom <br> Matt admired madly , though without envy . The role bought Matt and Frances <br> a pair of down coats for winter , and a refrigerator equipped with an ice-cube <br> dispenser . But what Matt really hoped for was getting back onstage . He <br> wanted to be in a play . <br> At the shoe-repair place his new soles were waiting for him . The proprietor , <br> an elderly Neapolitan , had chalked Attore across the bottom of Matt 's well- <br> worn slip-ons . Then he began his usual harangue : Matt should go into <br> opera . " I would n't be any good at it , " Matt said , as he always did , and flashed <br> his big even teeth . Against the whine of the rotary brush he launched into " La <br> donna e mobile . " The shoemaker shut off his machine and bent his knees <br> and clapped his hands and leaked tears down the accordion creases that <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck Matt just then that his friend <br> Salvatore had the fairy-tale crouch of Geppetto , the father of Pinocchio ; the <br> thought encouraged him to roll up the legs of his pants and jig , still loudly <br> singing . Salvatore hiccupped and roared and sobbed with laughter . <br> Sometimes Matt came into the shop just for a shine . The <br> shoemaker never let him pay . It was Matt 's trick to tell Frances ( his awful <br> deception , which made him ashamed ) that he was headed downtown for an <br> audition , and would n't it be a good idea to stop first to have his shoes buff <br> ed ? The point was to leave a decent impression for next time , even if they <br> did n't hire you this time . " Oh , for heaven 's sake , buy some shoe polish and <br> do it yourself , " Frances advised , but not harshly ; she was pleased about the <br> audition . <br> Of course there was n't any audition  --  or if there was , Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last slap of his flannel cloth , Matt hung <br> around , teasing and fooling , for half an hour or so , and then he walked over to <br> the public library to catch up on the current magazines . He was n't much of a <br> reader , though in principle he revered literature and worshiped Shakespeare <br> and Oscar Wilde . He looked through the Atlantic and Harper 's and The New <br> Yorker , all of which he liked ; Partisan Review , Commentary , magazines like <br> that , were over his head . <br> Sitting in the library , desultorily turning pages , he felt himself a <br> failure and an idler as well as a deceiver . He stared at his wristwatch . If he <br> left this minute , if he hurried , he might still be on time to read for Lionel : he <br> knew this director , he knew he was old-fashioned and meanly slow  --  one <br> reading was never enough . Matt guessed that Lionel was probably a bit of a <br> dyslexic . He made you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and <br> again , sometimes three or four times , while he himself read the other half <br> flatly , stumblingly . He did this whether he was seriously considering you or <br> had already mentally dismissed you : his credo was fairness , a breather , <br> another try . Or else he had a touch of sadism . Directors want to dominate <br> you , shape you , turn you into whatever narrow idea they have in their skulls . <br> To a director an actor is a puppet  --  Geppetto with Pinocchio . Matt loathed <br> the ritual of the audition ; it was humiliating . He was too much of a pro to be <br> put through these things , his track record ought to speak for itself , and why <br> did n't it ? Especially with Lionel ; they had both been in the business for <br> years . Lionel , like everyone else , called it " the business . " Matt never did . <br> He took off his watch and put it on the table . In another twenty <br> minutes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audition : it was <br> the lead Lionel was after , the place was full of young guys , the whole thing <br> was a misunderstanding . Lionel , believe it or not , had apologized for wasting <br> Matt 's time . <br> " Lionel apologized ? " Frances said . Without her glasses on , she <br> gave him one of her naked looks . It was a way she had of avoiding seeing <br> him while drilling straight through him . It made him feel damaged . <br> " You never went , " she said . " You never went near that audition . " <br> " Yes I did . I did go . That shit Lionel . Blew my whole day . " <br> " Do n't kid me . You did n't go . And Lionel 's not a shit , he 's been <br> good to you . He gave you the uncle part in Navy Blues only three years ago . I <br> do n't know why you insist on forgetting that . " <br> " It was junk . Garbage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . " <br> " Be realistic . You 're not twenty-five . " <br> " What 's realistic is if they give me access to my range . " <br> And so on . This was how they quarreled , and Matt was pained by <br> it : it was n't as if Frances did n't understand how much he hated sucking up to <br> directors , waiting for the verdict on his thickening fleshy arms , his round <br> stomach , his falsely grinning face , his posture , his walk , even his voice . His <br> voice he knew passed muster : it was like a yo-yo , he could command it to <br> tighten or stretch , to torque or lift . And still he had to submit to scrutiny , to <br> judgment , to prejudice , to whim . He hated having to be obsequious , even <br> when it took the form of jolliness , of ersatz collegiality . He hated lying . His <br> nose was growing from all the lies he told Frances . <br> On the other hand , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a <br> good impostor . A consummate actor is a consummate deceiver . Or put it <br> otherwise : an actor is someone who falls into the deeps of self-forgetfulness . <br> Or still otherwise : an actor is a puppeteer , with himself as puppet . <br> Matt frequently held forth in these trite ways  --  mostly to himself . <br> When it came to philosophy , he did n't fool anybody , he was n't an original . <br> " You got a call , " Frances said . <br> " Who ? " Matt said . <br> " You wo n't like who . You wo n't want to do it , it does n't fit your <br> range . " <br> " For crying out loud , " Matt said . " Who was it ? " <br> " Somebody from Ted Silkowitz 's . It 's something Ted Silkowitz is <br> doing . You wo n't like it , " she said again . <br> " Silkowitz , " Matt groaned . " The guy 's still in diapers . He 's sucking <br> his thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's it . He wants you and nobody else . " <br> " Cut it out , Frances . " <br> " See what I mean ? I know you , I knew you 'd react like that . You <br> wo n't want to do it . You 'll find some reason . " <br> She pulled a tissue from inside the sleeve of her sweater and <br> began to breathe warm fog on her lenses . Then she rubbed them with the <br> tissue . Matt was interested in bad eyesight  --  how it made people stand , the <br> pitch of their shoulders and necks . It was the kind of problem he liked to get <br> absorbed in . The stillness and also the movement . If acting was lying , it was <br> at the same time mercilessly and mechanically truth-telling . Watching <br> Frances push the earpieces of her glasses back into the thicket of her hair , <br> Matt thought how pleasing that was , how quickly and artfully she did it . He <br> could copy this motion exactly ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> teeth . If he looked hard enough , he could duplicate anything at all . Even his <br> nostrils , even his genitals , had that power . His mind was mostly a secret <br> kept from him  --  he could n't run it , it ran him , but he was intimate with its <br> nagging pushy heat . <br> " It 's got something to do with Lear . Something about King Lear , " <br> Frances said . " But never mind , it 's not for you . You would n't want to play a <br> geezer . " <br> " Lear ? What d' you mean , Lear ? " <br> " Something like that , I do n't know . You 're supposed to show up <br> tomorrow morning . If you 're interested , " she added ; he understood how sly <br> she could be . " Eleven o'clock . " " Well , well , " Matt said , " good thing I got my <br> shoes shined . " Not that he believed in miracles , but with Silkowitz anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surprises up their baby sleeves . <br> Silkowitz 's building was off Eighth Avenue , up past the theater district . The <br> neighborhood was all bars , interspersed with dark little slots of Greek <br> luncheonettes ; there was a sex shop on the corner . Matt , in suit and tie , <br> waited for the elevator to take him to Silkowitz 's office , on the fifth floor . It <br> turned out to be a cramped two-room suite : a front cubicle for the <br> receptionist , a boy who could n't have been more than nineteen , and a rear <br> cubicle for the director . The door to Silkowitz 's office was shut . <br> " Give him a minute . He 's on the phone , " the boy said . <br> " We 've run into a little problem with the writer . " <br> " The writer ? " Matt said stupidly . <br> " She died last night . After we called you about the Lear thing . " <br> " I thought the writer died a long time ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lear . " <br> " Matt Sorley , " Silkowitz yelled . " Come on in , let 's have a look . <br> You 're the incarnation of my dream  --  I 'm a big fan , I love your work . Hey , all <br> you need is a Panama hat . " <br> The hat crack was annoying ; it meant that Silkowitz was familiar <br> mainly with one of Matt 's roles on that television show  --  it was his signature <br> idiosyncrasy to wear a hat in court until the judge reprimanded him and made <br> him take it off . Matt said , " The writer 's dead ? " <br> " We 've got ourselves a tragedy . Heart attack . Two a.m. , passed <br> away in intensive care . Not that she 's any sort of spring chicken . Marlene <br> Miller-Weinstock , you know her ? " <br> " So there 's no play , " Matt said ; he was out of a job . <br> " Let me put it this way . There 's no playwright , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never heard of her , " Matt said . <br> " Right . Neither did I , until I got hold of this script . As far as I know <br> she 's written half a dozen novels . The kind that get published and then <br> disappear . Never wrote a play before . Face it , novelists ca n't do plays <br> anyhow . " <br> " Oh , I do n't know , " Matt said . " Gorky , Sartre , Steinbeck . <br> Galsworthy . Wilde . " It came to him that Silkowitz had probably never read <br> any of these old fellows from around the world . Not that Matt had either , but <br> he was married to someone who had read them all . <br> " Right , " Silkowitz conceded . " But you wo n't find Miller- Weinstock <br> on that list . The point is what I got from this woman is raw . Raw but full of <br> bounce . A big look at things . " <br> Silkowitz was cocky in a style that was new to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an exaggerated courtly patience that ended by stretching <br> out your misery ; Lionel 's shtick was to keep you in suspense . And Lionel <br> had a comfortingly aging face , with a firm deep wadi slashed across his <br> forehead , and a wen hidden in one eyebrow . Matt was used to Lionel  --  they <br> were two old war horses , they knew what to expect from each other . But here <br> was Silkowitz with his baby face  --  he did n't look a lot older than that boy <br> out there  --  and his low-hung childishly small teeth under a bumpy tract of <br> exposed fat gums : here was Silkowitz mysteriously dancing around a <br> questionable script by someone freshly deceased . The new breed , they did n't <br> wait out an apprenticeship , it was drama school at Yale and then the abrupt <br> ascent into authority , reputation , buzz . The sureness of this man , sweatshirt <br> and jeans , pendant dangling from the neck , a silver ring on his thumb , hair as <br> sleek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing with power . Still <br> a kid , Silkowitz was already on his way into Lionel 's league : he could make <br> things happen . Ten years from now the scruff y office would be just as scruff <br> y , just as out of the way , though presumably more spacious ; the boy out <br> front would end up a Hollywood agent , or else head out for the stock <br> exchange in a navy blazer with brass buttons . Lionel left you feeling heavy , <br> superfluous , a bit of an impediment . This Silkowitz , an enthusiast , charged <br> you up : Matt had the sensation of an electric wire going up his spine , probing <br> and poking his vertebrae . <br> " Look , it 's a shock , " Silkowitz said . " I do n't feel good about it , but <br> the fact is I never met the woman . Today was supposed to be the day . Right <br> this instant , actually . I figured first organize the geriatric ward , get the writer <br> and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 've still got our lead . " <br> " Lead , " Matt said ; but " geriatric , " quip or not , left him sour . <br> " Right . The minute I set eyes on the script I knew you were the <br> one . As a matter of fact , " Silkowitz said , flashing a pair of clean pink <br> palms , " I ran into Lionel the other night and he put me on to you . " <br> These two statements struck Matt as contradictory , but he kept <br> his mouth shut . He had his own scenario , Silkowitz scouting for an old actor <br> and Lionel coming up with Matt : " Call Sorley . Touchy guy , takes offense at <br> the drop of a hat , but one hundred percent reliable . Learns his lines and <br> shows up . " Showing up being nine-tenths of talent . <br> Matt was businesslike . " So you intend to do the play without the <br> writer . " <br> " We do n't need the writer . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I 'm concerned , theater 's a director 's medium . " <br> Oh , portentous : Silkowitz as infant lecturer . And full of himself . If <br> he could do without the writer , maybe he could do without the actor ? <br> Silkowitz handed Matt an envelope . " Photocopy of the script , " he <br> said . " Take it home . Read it . I 'll call you , you 'll come in again , we 'll talk . " <br> Matt hefted the envelope . Thick , not encouraging . In a way <br> Silkowitz was right about novelists doing plays . They overwrite , they put in a <br> character 's entire psychology , from birth on : a straitjacket for an actor . The <br> actor 's job is to figure out the part , to feel it out . Feather on feather , tentative , <br> groping . The first thing Matt did was take a black marking pen and cross out <br> all the stage directions . That left just the dialogue , and the dialogue made <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <br> " Never mind , " Frances said . " Why should you care ? It 's work , you <br> wanted to work . " <br> " It 's not that the idea 's so bad . Takes off from the real thing . " <br> " So what 's the problem ? " <br> " I ca n't do it , that 's the problem . " <br> Naturally he could n't do it . And he resented Silkowitz 's demand <br> that he trek all the way down to that sex-shop corner again  --  was n't the <br> telephone good enough ? Silkowitz threw out the news that he could n't <br> proceed , he could n't think , except in person : he was big on face to face . As if <br> all that counted was his own temperament . With a touch of spite Matt was <br> pleased to be ten minutes late . <br> A young woman was in the outer cubicle . <br> " He 's waiting for you , " she said . " He 's finishing up his lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silkowitz licked a plastic spoon and heaved an empty yogurt cup <br> into a wastebasket across the room . " Quit . Got a job as assistant stage <br> manager in some Off Off . So , what d' you say ? " <br> " The part 's not for me . I could 've told you this straight off on the <br> phone . The character 's ten years older than I am . Maybe fifteen . " <br> " You 've got plenty of time to grow a beard . It 'll come in white . " <br> " I do n't know anything about the background here , it 's not my <br> milieu . " <br> " The chance of a lifetime , " Silkowitz argued . " Who gets to play <br> Lear , for God 's sake ? " <br> Matt said heavily , bitterly , " Yeah . The Lear of Ellis Island . Just off <br> the boat . " <br> " That 's the ticket , " Silkowitz said . " Think of it as a history play . " <br> Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A history <br> riff for sure . Fourth , fifth generation , steerage troubles long ago strained out of <br> his blood  --  it was all a romance to little Teddy Silkowitz . Second Avenue <br> down at Twelfth , the old Yiddish theater , the old feverish plays . Weeping on <br> the stage , weeping in all the rows . Miller-Weinstock ( " May she rest in <br> peace , " Silkowitz put in ) was the daughter of one of those pioneer performers <br> of greenhorn drama ; the old man , believe it or not , was still alive at ninety-six , <br> a living fossil , an actual breathing known-to-be-extinct duck-billed dodo . <br> That 's where she got it from  --  from being his daughter . Those novels she <br> turned out , maybe they were second rate , who knows ? Silkowitz did n't <br> know  --  he 'd scarcely looked at the handful of reviews she 'd sent  --  and it <br> did n't matter . What mattered was the heat that shot straight out of her script , <br> like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenements along Southern Boulevard in the thirties Bronx , or the whiff of <br> summer ozone at the trolley-stop snarl at West Farms . It was n't those <br> Depression times that fired Silkowitz  --  it was n't that sort of recapturing he <br> was after . Matt was amazed  --  Matt who worshiped nuance , tendril , shadow , <br> intimation , instinct , Matt who might jig for a shoemaker but delivered hints <br> and shadings to the proscenium , Matt who despised exaggeration , <br> caricature , going over the top , Matt for whom the stage was holy ground . . . <br> And what did little Teddy Silkowitz want ? <br> " Reversal , " Silkowitz said . " Time to change gears . The changing of <br> the guard . Change , that 's what ! Where 's the overtness , the overture , the <br> passion , the emotion ? For fifty , sixty years all we 've had is mutters , <br> muteness , tight lips , and , goddamn it , you ca n't hear their voices , all that <br> Actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of <br> Quakers waiting for Inner Light  --  obsolete ! Dying , dead , finished ! Listen , <br> Matt , I 'm talking heat , muscle , human anguish . Where 's the theatrical noise ? <br> The big speeches and declamations ? All these anemic monosyllabic washed- <br> out twohanders with their impotent little climaxes . Matt , let me tell you my <br> idea , and I tell it with respect , because I 'm in the presence of an old-timer , <br> and I want you to know I know my place . But we 're in a new era now , and <br> someone 's got to make that clear  --  " Silkowitz 's kindling look moved all <br> around , from desk to floor to ceiling ; those hot eyes , it seemed to Matt , could <br> scald the paint off the walls . " This is what I 'm for . Take it seriously . My idea <br> is to restore the old lost art of melodrama . People call it melodrama to put it <br> down , but what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And the chance <br> came out of the blue ! From the daughter of the genuine article ! " <br> Matt said roughly ( his roughness surprised him ) , " You 've got the <br> wrong customer . " <br> " Look before you leap , pal . Do n't try to pin that nostalgia stuff on <br> me . The youthful heart throbbing for grandpa 's world . That 's what you figure , <br> right ? " <br> " Not exactly , " Matt fibbed . <br> " That 's not it , honest to God . It 's the largeness  --  big feelings , big <br> cries . Outcries ! The old Yiddish theater kept it up while it was dying out <br> everywhere else . Killed by understatement . Killed by abbreviation , <br> downplaying . Killed by sophistication , modernism , psychologizing , <br> Stanislavsky , all those highbrow murderers of the Greek chorus , you see <br> what I mean ? The Yiddish Medea . The Yiddish Macbeth ! Matt , it was big ! " <br> " As far as I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is old- <br> timer . " <br> " There are n't many of your type around , " Silkowitz admitted . <br> " Look , I 'm saying I really want you to do this thing . The part 's <br> yours . " <br> " A replay of the old country , that 's my type ? I was doing Eugene <br> O'Neill before you were born . " " You 've read the script , it 's in regular English . <br> American as apple pie . Lear on the Lower East Side ! We can make that the <br> Upper West Side . And those daughters  --  I 've got some great women in <br> mind . We can update everything , we can do what we want . " <br> " Yeah , we do n't have the writer to kick around . " Matt looked down <br> at his trouser cuff s . They were beginning to fray at the crease ; he needed a <br> new suit . " I 'm not connected to any of that . My mother 's father came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish grandee , no kidding . I did n't realize . You look  --  " <br> " I know how I look , " Matt broke in . " A retired pants presser . " He <br> wanted to play Ibsen , he wanted to play Shaw ! Henry Higgins with Eliza . <br> Something grand , aloof , cynical ; he could do Brit talk beautifully . <br> Silkowitz pushed on . " Lionel says he 's pretty sure you 're free . " <br> Free . The last time Matt was on a stage ( televison did n't count ) <br> was in Lionel 's own junk play , a London import , where Matt , as the beloved <br> missing uncle , turned up just before the final curtain . That was more than <br> three years ago ; by now four . <br> " I 'll give it some thought , " Matt said . <br> " It 's a deal . Start growing the beard . There 's only one thing . A bit <br> of homework you need to do . " <br> " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the plot goes . Regan and <br> Goneril and Cordelia . I read it in high school . " But it was n't Shakespeare <br> Silkowitz had in mind : it was <br> Eli Miller the nonagenarian . Silkowitz had the old fellow 's address <br> at a " senior residence . " Probably the daughter had mentioned its name , and <br> Silkowitz had ordered his underling  --  the boy , or maybe the girl  --  to look it <br> up . It was called the Home for the Elderly Children of Israel , and it was up <br> near the Cloisters . <br> " Those places give me the creeps , " Matt complained to <br> Frances . " The smell of pee and the zombie stare . " <br> " It does n't have to be like that . They have activities and things . <br> They have social directors . At that age maybe they go for blue material , you <br> never know . " <br> " Sure , " Matt said . " The borscht belt up from the dead and <br> unbuckled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the point of that ? Silkowitz wants you to get the feel of <br> the old days . In Tulsa we did n't have the old days . " <br> " Suppose the guy does n't speak English ? I mean just in case . <br> Then I 'm helpless . " <br> So Frances went along ; Tulsa notwithstanding , she knew some <br> attenuated strands of household Yiddish . She was a demon at languages <br> anyhow ; she liked to speckle her tougher crosswords with cri de coeur , <br> Mitleid , situaci=n diffcil . She had once studied ancient Greek and Sanskrit . <br> A mild January had turned venomous . The air slammed their foreheads like a <br> frozen truncheon . Bundled in their down coats , they waited for a bus . Icicles <br> hung from its undercarriage , dripping black sludge . The long trip through <br> afternoon dark took them to what seemed like a promontory ; standing in the <br> driveway of the Home for the Elderly Children of Israel , they felt like a pair of <br> hawks surveying rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain , " Frances muttered as they left the reception desk and headed <br> down the corridor to room 1-A : Eli Miller 's digs . <br> No one was there . <br> " Let 's trespass , " Frances said . Matt followed her in . The place <br> was overheated ; in two minutes he had gone from chill to sweat . He was glad <br> Frances had come . At times she was capable of an unexpected <br> aggressiveness . He saw it now and then as she worked at her grids , her lists <br> of synonyms , her trickster definitions . Her hidden life inside those little <br> squares gave off an electric ferocity . She was prowling all around 1-A as if it <br> was one of her boxes waiting to be solved . The room was cryptic enough : <br> what was it like to be so circumscribed  --  a single dresser crowded with <br> tubes and medications , a sagging armchair upholstered in balding plush , a <br> bed for dry bones  --  knowing it to be your last stop before the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very high , with fat carved legs ; it was <br> covered all over with a sort of wrinkly cloak , heavy maroon velvet tasseled at <br> the corners  --  a royal drapery that might have been snatched from the <br> boudoir of a noblewoman of the Tsar 's court . A child 's footstool stood at the <br> bedside . <br> " He must be a little guy , " Frances said . " When you get old you <br> start to shrink . " <br> " Old-timer , " Matt spat out . " Can you imagine ? That 's what he <br> called me actually . " <br> " Who did ? " <br> " That twerp Silkowitz . " <br> Frances ignored this . " Get a look at that bedspread or whatever it <br> is . I 'd swear a piece of theater curtain . And the bed ! Stage furniture . Good <br> God , has he read all this stuff ? " <br> Every space not occupied by the dresser , the chair , and the bed <br> was tumbled with books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the <br> floorboards in wobbly stacks , with narrow aisles between . Some had fallen <br> and lay open like wings , their pages pulled from their spines . <br> " German , Russian , Hebrew , Yiddish . A complete set of Dickens . <br> Look , " Frances said , " Moby-Dick ! " <br> " In the atrium they told me visitors , " said a voice in the doorway . It <br> was the brassy monotone of the almost-deaf , a horn bereft of music . Frances <br> hiked up her glasses and wiped her right hand on her coat : Moby-Dick was <br> veiled in grime . <br> " Mr. Miller ? " Matt said . <br> " Bereaved , sir . Eli Miller is bereaved . " <br> " I heard about your daughter . I 'm so sorry , " Matt said ; but if this <br> was going to be a conversation , he hardly knew how to get hold of it . <br> The old man was short , with thick shoulders and the head of a <br> monk . Or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked scalp , shiny as <br> glass , and all around it a billowing ring of pearl-white hair , charged with static <br> electricity . His cheeks were a waterfall of rubbery creases . One little eye <br> peeped out from the flow , dangerously blue . The other was sealed into its <br> socket . You might call him ancient , but you could n't call him frail . He looked <br> like a man who even now could take an ax to a bull . <br> He went straight to the stepstool , picked it up , and tossed it into <br> the corridor ; it made a brutal clatter . <br> " When I go out they put in trash . I tell them , Eli Miller requires no <br> ladders ! " With the yell of the deaf he turned to Frances . " She was a woman <br> your age . What , you 're fifty ? Your father , he 's living ? " <br> " He died years ago , " Frances said . Her age was private ; a sore <br> point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not survive the child . A <br> very unhappy individual , my daughter . Divorced . The husband flies away to <br> Alaska and she 's got her rotten heart . A shame , against nature  --  Eli Miller , <br> the heart and lungs of an elephant ! Better a world filled with widows than <br> divorced . " He curled his thick butcher 's arm around Frances 's coat <br> collar . " Madam , my wife if you could see her you would be dumbstruck . She <br> had unusually large eyes and with a little darkening of the eyelids they <br> became larger . Big and black like olives . Thirty-two years she 's gone . She <br> had a voice they could hear it from the second balcony , rear row . " <br> Matt caught Frances 's look : it was plain she was writing the old <br> fellow off . Not plugged in , Frances was signaling , nobody home upstairs , lost <br> his marbles . Matt decided to trust the better possibility : a bereaved father <br> has a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daughter 's play , " he began ; he spoke <br> evenly , reasonably . <br> " An ambitious woman . Talent not so strong . Whoever has Eli <br> Miller for a father will be ambitious . Eli Miller 's talent , this is another <br> dimension . What you see here "  --  he waved all around 1-A  --  " are remnants . <br> Fragments and vestiges ! The Bewildered Bridegroom , 1924 ! " He pinched a bit <br> of the maroon velvet bedspread and fingered its golden tassel . " From the hem <br> of Esther Borodovsky 's dress hung twenty-five like this ! And four hundred <br> books on the walls of Dr. Borodovsky ! That 's how we used to do it , no <br> stinginess ! And who do you think played the Bridegroom ? Eli Miller ! The <br> McKinley Square Theater , Boston Road and 169th , they do n't forget such <br> nights , whoever was there they remember ! " <br> Matt asked , " You know your daughter wrote a play ? She told you ? " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Polonius . <br> Polonius the great philosopher , very serious , very wise . Jacob Adler 's <br> Shylock , an emperor ! Tomashefsky , Schwartz , Carnovsky ! " <br> " Matt , " Frances whispered , " I want to leave now . " Matt said <br> slowly , " Your daughter 's play is getting produced . I 'm in it . I 'm an actor . " <br> The old man ejected a laugh . His dentures struck like a pair of <br> cymbals ; the corona of his magnetic hair danced . " Actor , actor , call yourself <br> what you want , only watch what you say in front of Eli Miller ! My daughter , <br> first it 's romanen , now it 's a play ! Not only is the daughter taken before the <br> father but also the daughter is mediocre . Always mediocre . She can not <br> ascend to the father ! Eli Miller the pinnacle ! The daughter climbs and falls . <br> Mediocre ! " <br> " Matt , let 's go , " Frances growled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man embraced her ; Frances <br> recoiled . " This one is also in it ? " <br> " Here , " Matt said , and handed Eli Miller one of Teddy Silkowitz 's <br> cards . " If you want to know more , here 's the director . " He stopped ; he <br> thought better of what he was about to say . But he said it anyway : " He <br> admires your daughter 's work . " <br> " Eli Miller 's Polonius , in the highest literary Yiddish , sir ! Standing <br> ovations and bravo every night . Every matinee . Three matinees a week , that 's <br> how it was . Bravo bravo . By the time she 's born , it 's after the war , it 's 1948 , <br> it 's finishing up , it 's practically gone . Gone  --  the whole thing ! After Hitler , <br> who has a heart for tragedy on a stage ? Anyhow no more actors , only movie <br> stars . Please , sir , do me a favor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is <br> it , who remembers ? But Eli Miller and Esther Borodovsky , also Dr. <br> Borodovsky , whoever was there they remember ! " <br> " With or without you , " Frances warned , " I 'm going . " <br> Matt hung on . " Your daughter 's play , " he said , " is out of respect <br> for all that . For everything you feel . " <br> " What are you saying ? I know what she is ! My daughter , all her <br> life she figures one thing , to take away Eli Miller 's soul . This is why God <br> makes her mediocre , this is why God buries the daughter before the father ! " <br> They left him with tears running out of the one blue eye . <br> " I think you incited him , " Frances said . " You just went ahead and <br> provoked him . " They were huddled in the bus shelter , out of the wind . It was <br> five o'clock and already night . <br> Matt said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " Are you kidding ? " Frances said ; hunched inside the bulk of her <br> coat , she was shivering . <br> " You 're always telling me I do that . " <br> " Do what ? " <br> " Act all the time . " <br> " Oh , for Pete 's sake , " Frances said . " Why did you make me come <br> anyhow ? My toes are numb . " <br> Late in February , a day of falling snow , rehearsals began . Silkowitz had <br> rented a cellar in a renovated old building in the West Forties , in sight of the <br> highway and the river . The space had a stage at one end and at the other a <br> sort of stockade surrounding a toilet that occasionally backed up . The ceiling <br> groaned and shuddered . A far-off piano thumped out distracting rhythms : <br> there was a dance studio overhead . The cast was smaller than Matt had <br> expected  --  the three female roles had been reduced to two . Silkowitz had <br> spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not satisfied . No <br> sooner did Matt learn the moves of a scene than the director had second <br> thoughts and rearranged the blocking . To Matt 's surprise , the boy who had <br> been in Silkowitz 's office was there , presiding over a notebook ; Silkowitz had <br> brought him back to be stage manager . Matt calculated that the kid had six <br> weeks ' experience . <br> Silkowitz had put himself in charge of secrets . Each rehearsal <br> session felt like a cabal from which the actors were excluded . Strangers <br> came and went , carrying portfolios . Silkowitz never introduced any of <br> them . " This is going to be a tight job , nothing extraneous . I believe in <br> collaboration with all my heart , but just remember that collaboration runs <br> through me , " he announced . And another time : " My intention is to clot the <br> curds . " It was a tyranny that outstripped even Lionel 's . The veneer was on the <br> shabby side , but there was a stubborn complacency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liked to cavil , was disinclined to argue with Silkowitz . The <br> director would stop him mid-sentence to murmur against a wall with one of <br> those coming and going unknowns : it was a discussion of the set , or some <br> question about the lighting ; or there would be the incidental music to <br> consider . The house was already booked , Silkowitz reported  --  a two- <br> **30;1314;TOOLONG west of Union Square  --  and he had nailed <br> down a pair of invisible backers , whom he did not name . Silkowitz had a <br> reputation for working fast : what seemed important yesterday no longer <br> mattered today . He scarcely listened when Matt began to tell about the visit <br> to Eli Miller . " Good , good , " he replied , " right , " and turned away to look over <br> someone 's swatch of cloth . It was as if he had never insisted on the journey <br> to the Home for the Elderly Children of Israel . <br> At the end of each day 's rehearsal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the actors around him in a halfcircle and gave them his <br> notes . And then came the daily exhortation : what he wanted from them all , <br> he said , was more passion , more susceptibility . He wanted them to be <br> drinking metaphorical poison ; he wanted them to pour out blood and bile and <br> bitter gall . <br> " Especially you , Matt . You 're underplaying again . Forget that less- <br> is-more business , it 's crap ! More energy ! We 've got to hear the thunderclap . " <br> Matt 's throat hurt . He was teaching himelf to howl . He had <br> abandoned all his customary techniques : his vocal cords seemed perplexed <br> by these new uses . He felt his chest fill with a curious darkness . In the <br> morning , before taking the subway down to rehearsal , he tramped through the <br> blackening snow to the public library and found a warm spot near a radiator <br> and fell into King Lear , the original . He saw how those selfish women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder he howls ! <br> He was heading back to the subway when it occurred to him that <br> it was weeks since he had stepped into the shoe-repair shop . <br> Salvatore did not know him . <br> " Hey , Salvatore ! " Matt called in that stagy roar Silkowitz liked , and <br> attempted an abbreviated version of his little comic jig . But in his clumsy <br> buckled-up snow boots he could only stamp . <br> Salvatore said over the noise of his machines , " You got shoes to <br> fix , mister ? " <br> " What 's the matter with you ? " Matt said . <br> " Il attore ! " <br> The trouble was the beard , the shoemaker said . Who could see it <br> was his friend Matteo ? What was the beard for ? Had he gone into opera after <br> all ? With the beard he looked one hundred years old . This frightened Matt . <br> Just as Silkowitz had predicted , Matt 's whiskers had grown in stark white : he <br> was passing for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way he had gone into opera . Marlene Miller- <br> Weinstock 's primal voice still reverberated , even with Silkowitz 's changes . <br> His changes were logistical : he had moved the locale , updated the era , and <br> accommodated the names of the characters to contemporary ears . Marlene <br> Miller-Weinstock 's play was a kind of thirties costume drama , and Silkowitz <br> had modernized it . That was all . The speeches were largely unaltered . <br> Grandiloquence ! There were no insinuations or intimations , none of those <br> shrewd hesitations Matt loved to linger over . His gods were ellipsis and <br> inference . Hers were bombast and excitation . Matt 's particular skill was in <br> filling in the silent spaces : he did it with his whole elastic face , and in the <br> stance of his legs  --  a skeptical tilt of knee , an ironical angle of heel . But <br> Marlene Miller-Weinstock 's arias left no room for any play of suggestion or <br> uncertainty . Fury ruled ; fury and conviction and a relentless and fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth ; it amazed him that this could be so . His <br> actor 's credo had always been the opposite : glimmer and inkling are truth , <br> hint and intuition are truth ; nuance is essence . What Marlene Miller- <br> Weinstock was after was malevolence , rage , even madness : vehemence <br> straight out ; shrieks blasted from the whirlwind 's bowel . She was all storm . In <br> the gale 's wild din  --  inside all that howling  --  Matt was learning how to hear <br> the steady blows of some interior cannon . The booms were loud and regular : <br> it was his own heartbeat . <br> Those two women with him on that dusty ill-lit stage  --  he felt <br> apart from them , he saw them as moving shadows of himself . He felt apart <br> from the men , one of whom he had worked with before , under Lionel 's <br> direction . And in the darkened margins of the place , on folding chairs along <br> the wall , here was the boy with his notebook , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foot up and down as if marching to an unheard <br> band . But Matt had pushed through a vestibule of embarrassment ( it was <br> shame over being made to howl ) into some solitary chamber , carpeted and <br> tapestried ; it was as if he had broken through a membrane , a lung , behind <br> which a sudden altar crouched , covered with Eli Miller 's heavy tasseled <br> bedspread . In this chamber Matt listened to his heartbeat . He understood <br> that it was n't Silkowitz who had led him here . Silkowitz was a literalist , a <br> sentimentalist , a theorist  --  one of these , or all . Mainly he was flashy . <br> Silkowitz 's bets were on the future . He had nothing to do with this voluptuous <br> clamor , Matt inside the gonging of his own rib cage , alone and very large ; <br> terrifyingly huge there on that dusty ill-lit stage . Marlene Miller-Weinstock <br> had drawn him in . Or her father had . Inside his howl , Matt was beginning to <br> believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the father in <br> order to copy his soul . <br> Silkowitz was pleased . " You 've got it together , " he told <br> Matt . " Stick with Matt , " he said to the others . He praised Matt for being <br> everywhere at once , like a rushing ghost ; for looking into the women 's eyes <br> with a powerful intimacy beyond naturalism ; for what he called " symbolic <br> stature " and " integration into the scene . " All this puzzled Matt . He hated the <br> lingo . It was n't what he was feeling , it was n't what he was doing . He had no <br> consciousness of being part of a company . He was n't serving the company , <br> whatever Silkowitz might think . He was in pursuit of his grand howl . He <br> wanted to go on living inside it . When rehearsals were over he kept to himself <br> and hurried to the subway . <br> Ten days before the opening , Silkowitz moved the cast to the theater . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but workable . To get to <br> the men 's dressing room you had to go through a narrow airless tunnel with <br> great rusted pipes sweating overhead . The place was active , swarming . The <br> boy with the notebook kept on checking his lists and schedules ; he seemed <br> professional enough . Wires crisscrossed the floor . Taped music traveled on <br> phantom waves between scenes . Big wooden shapes materialized , pushed <br> back and forth along the apron . Silkowitz had a hand in everything , running <br> from corner to corner , his long girlish hair rippling , the silver thumb ring <br> reddening in the light of the Exit sign whenever he glided past it . <br> Frances had decided to attend these final days of rehearsal . <br> Silkowitz made no objection . She came hauling a tote bag , and settled into <br> the next-to-last row , laying out her dictionaries and references and pencils on <br> the seats around her . She worked quietly , but Matt knew she was attentive <br> and worried . He was indifferent to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howl . She mocked it as rant , but it did n't trouble her that <br> Matt had departed from his usual style  --  he was doing his job , he was giving <br> the director what he wanted . What it meant was a paycheck . And by now <br> Matt could n't claim , either , that Silkowitz was egging him on . The director <br> was taking in whatever Matt was emitting . He was emitting a sea of <br> lamentation . Frances dumped her papers back into the tote and listened . <br> Matt was standing downstage , alone , in profile , leaning forward like a sail in <br> the wind , or like the last leaf of a wintry tree . He looked wintry himself . It was <br> the day 's concluding run-through ; the rest of the cast had left . Matt was <br> doing his solo scene near the end of the second act . His big belly had mostly <br> sunk . Lately he had no appetite . He was never hungry . His beard had <br> lengthened raggedly ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed mesmerized , suffering . He was staring ahead , into the dark of the <br> wings . <br> He turned to Silkowitz . " Someone 's out there , " he said . <br> " There should n't be , " Silkowitz said . " Sally 's kid 's sick , she went <br> home . And anyhow her cue brings her in the other way . Is that electrician still <br> working back there ? " he called to the boy with the notebook . <br> " Everyone 's gone , " the boy called back . <br> Matt said hoarsely , " I thought I saw someone . " He had let his hair <br> grow down to meet the beard . His eyes were birdlike , ringed with creases . <br> " O.K. , call it a day . You 're not the only one who 's dead tired , " <br> Silkowitz said . " Go get some sleep . " <br> On the way to the subway , Frances beside him , Matt <br> brooded . " There was a guy out there . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him . " <br> " It 's the neighborhood . Some creep wandered in . " <br> " He was there yesterday too . In the middle of that same speech . I <br> think someone 's hiding out . " <br> " Where ? In the men 's toilet ? " <br> " Ever since we got to the theater . I saw him the first day . " <br> " You never said anything . " <br> " I was n't sure he was there . " <br> He was sorry he had spoken at all . It was n't something he wanted <br> to discuss with Frances . She had ridiculed his howl ; now she was telling him <br> it was worse than rant , he was hamming it up . The ignorance , the <br> obtuseness ! He was seized , dissolved , metamorphosed . His howl had altered <br> him : the throat widens and becomes a highway for specters , the lungs an <br> echo chamber for apparitions . His howl had floated him far above Frances , far <br> above Silkowitz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the <br> same , interchangeable , tummlers and barkers , different styles , what did it <br> matter ? Silkowitz was attracted to boldness and color , voices as noisy as an <br> old music hall ; he was as helpless as Frances to uncover what lay in the <br> cave of the howl . As for the actors , Matt saw them as automatons ; he was <br> alone , alone . Except for the man who was hiding out , lurking , gazing . <br> " My God , Matt , " Frances exploded , " you 're hallucinating all over <br> the place . It 's enough you 've started to look the part , you do n't have to go <br> crazy on top of it . Do n't expect me to go there again , I 'm keeping away , I 've <br> got my deadlines anyhow . " <br> That night her grids <br> sprouted " urus , " " muleta , " " athanor , " " stammel , " " nystagmic , " " mugient . " She <br> worked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to <br> polish her lenses . Matt knew her to be inexorably logical . <br> The day before dress rehearsal , Matt brought his shoes in for a shine . <br> Salvatore seemed wary . Matteo , he said , no longer looked one hundred years <br> old ; he looked two hundred . <br> " You know , " Matt said carefully  --  he had to whisper now to <br> preserve his howl  --  " there 's something better than opera . " <br> Salvatore said there was nothing better than opera . What could be <br> better than opera ? For the first time he let Matt pay for his shine . <br> Dress rehearsal went well , though a little too speedily . The man in <br> the wings had not returned . Silkowitz sat with the cast and gave his last <br> notes . He did not address Matt . Odors of coffee and pastries wafted , and with <br> unexpected lust Matt devoured a bagel spread with cream cheese . He <br> understood himself to be in possession of a deep tranquility . All around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silliness ; it was <br> fruition , it was anticipation . The director joined in , told jokes , teased , traded <br> anecdotes and rumors . A journalist , a red-haired woman from the Times , <br> arrived to interview Silkowitz . He had hired an industrious publicist ; there had <br> been many such journalists . This one had just come from speaking to Lionel , <br> she said , to cover the story from another angle : how , for instance , a more <br> traditional director might view the goings-on down near Union Square . Lionel <br> had responded coolly : he was a minimalist ; he repudiated what he took to be <br> Teddy Silkowitz 's gaudy postmodern experimentalism . Would he show up at <br> the opening ? No , he thought not . <br> " He 'll be here , " Silkowitz told the interviewer . The little party was <br> breaking up . " And do n't I know what 's bugging him . He used to do this sort of <br> thing himself . He was a child actor at the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Lionel 's an Anglophile . " <br> " I read up on it , " Silkowitz assured her . " In 1933 he played the boy <br> Shloymele in Mirele Efros . God forbid anybody should find out . " <br> The cast , packing up to go home , laughed ; was n't this one of <br> Silkowitz 's show-biz gags ? But Matt was still contemplating the man in the <br> wings . He had worked himself up to unhealthy visions . It was likely that <br> Frances was right ; at least she was sensible . Someone had sneaked in from <br> the street . A homeless fellow sniffing out a warm corner to spend the night . A <br> drunk in need of a toilet . Or else a stagehand pilfering cigarettes on the sly . <br> A banner , a rope , an anything , swaying in the narrow wind that blew through <br> a crack in the rafters . Backstage  --  deserted at the end of the day , inhabited <br> by the crawling dark . <br> On the other hand , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old <br> guy . It was Eli Miller , come down on the M-4 bus from his velvet-curtained <br> bed in the Home for the Elderly Children of Israel . Lionel would keep his word . <br> He would stay away . Matt had his own thoughts about this , on a different <br> track from Silkowitz 's . Matt as Lear ! Or a kind of Lear . Lionel had never given <br> Matt the lead in anything ; he was eating crow . Naturally he would n't put in an <br> appearance . Thanks to Marlene Miller-Weinstock  --  swallowing her father 's <br> life , vomiting out a semblance of Lear  --  it was a case of Matt 's having the <br> last laugh . <br> In the clouded dressing-room mirror , preparing during intermission for the <br> second act , he thickened his eyebrows with paint and white gum and spilled <br> too much powder all over his beard  --  the excesses and accidents of <br> opening night . He stepped out of his newly polished shoes to stand on bare <br> feet and then pulled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A <br> tremor shook his lip . He examined the figure in the mirror . It was himself , his <br> own horrifying head . He resembled what he remembered of Job  --  diseased , <br> cut down , humiliated . The shoemaker if he could see him would add another <br> hundred years . <br> The first act had survived the risks . Silkowitz had all along worried <br> that the audience , rocked by the unfamiliar theatricality  --  the loudness , the <br> broadness , the brazenness , the bigness  --  would presume something <br> farcical . He was in fear of the first lone laugh . A shock in the serpent 's tail <br> pulses through to its tongue . An audience is a single beast , a great vibrating <br> integer , a shifting amoeba without a nucleus . One snicker anywhere in its <br> body can set off convulsions everywhere , from the orchestra to the balcony . <br> Such were the director 's sermons , recounting the perils ahead ; Matt <br> habitually shut out these platitudes . And more from that cornucopia  --  think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Greek players on stilts , <br> heavily , boldly masked ; the old plays of Athens and the old plays of Second <br> Avenue are blood cousins , kin to kin . Power and passion ! Passion and power ! <br> Were they pulling it off ? During the whole first act , a breathing <br> silence . <br> Sweating , panting his minor pant , Silkowitz came into the <br> dressing room . Matt turned his back . A transgression . An invasion . Where <br> now was that sacred stricture about the inviolability of an actor 's <br> concentration in the middle of a performance , did n't that fool Silkowitz know <br> better ? A rip in the brain . Matt was getting ready to lock it up  --  his brain ; he <br> was goading it into isolation , into that secret chamber , all tapestried and <br> tasseled . He was getting ready to enter his howl , and here was Silkowitz , <br> sweating , panting , superfluous , what was he doing here , the fool ? <br> " Your wife said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> paper . He recognized it as a sheet from the little spiral pad Frances always <br> carried in her pocketbook . It was her word-collector . <br> " Not now . I do n't want this now . " The fool ! <br> " She insisted , " Silkowitz said , and slid away . He looked afraid ; for <br> the first time he looked respectful . Matt felt his own force ; his howl was <br> already in his throat . What was Frances up to ? Transgression , invasion ! <br> He read : " metamerism , " " oribi , " " glyptic , " " enatic "  --  all in <br> Frances 's compact , orderly fountain-pen print . But an inch below , in rapid <br> pencil : " Be advised . I saw him . He 's here . " She had chosen her seat herself : <br> front row balcony , an aerie from which to spot the reviewers and eavesdrop on <br> the murmurs , the sighs , the whispers . She meant to spy , to search out who <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there . He was in the audience . <br> He had turned up after all  --  out of rivalry . Out of jealousy . Because of the <br> buzz . To get the lay of Silkowitz 's land . An old director looking in on a young <br> one : age , fear , displacement . They were saying Lionel was past it ; they were <br> saying little Teddy Silkowitz , working on a shoestring out of a dinky cell over <br> a sex shop , was cutting edge . So Lionel was out there , Lionel who made <br> Matt audition , who humiliated him , who stuck him with the geezer role , a bit <br> part in the last scene of a half-baked London import . <br> As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods ; they killus for their sport . <br> Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor , bare , fork 'd animal as <br> thou art . <br> Lear on the heath  --  now let Lionel learn what a geezer role could <br> be , and Matt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not come for Silkowitz , he would <br> not come for Matt . Matt understood this . It was someone else Frances had <br> seen . <br> He made his second-act entrance . The set was abstract , filled <br> with those cloth-wrapped wooden free forms that signified the city . Silkowitz <br> had brought the heath to upper Broadway . But no one laughed , no one <br> coughed . It was Lear all the same , daughter-betrayed , in a storm , half mad , <br> sported with by the gods , a poor , bare , forked animal , homeless , shoeless , <br> crying in the gutters of a city street on a snowy night . The fake snow drifted <br> down . Matt 's throat let out its unholy howl ; it spewed out old forgotten exiles , <br> old lost cities , Constantinople , Alexandria , kingdoms abandoned , refugees <br> ragged and driven , distant ash heaps , daughters unborn , Frances 's wasted <br> eggs and empty uterus , the wild roaring cannon of a human heartbeat . <br> A noise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> downstage , blinded , and tried to peer through the lights . A black silhouette <br> was thudding up the middle aisle , shrieking . Three stairs led upward to the <br> apron ; up thudded the silhouette . It was Eli Miller in a threadbare cape , <br> waving a walking stick . <br> " This is not the way ! This is not the way ! " Eli Miller yelled , and <br> slammed his stick down again and again on the floor of the stage . " Liars , <br> thieves , corruption ! In the mother tongue , with sincerity , not from such a <br> charlatan like this ! " He thudded toward Matt ; his breath was close . It smelled <br> of farina . Matt saw the one blue eye , the one dead eye . <br> " Jacob Adler , he could show you ! Not like this ! Take Eli Miller 's <br> word for it , this is not the way ! You were n't there , you did n't see , you did n't <br> hear ! " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People , " he <br> called , " listen to Eli Miller , they 're leading you by the nose here , it 's <br> charlatanism ! Pollution ! Nobody remembers ! Ladies and gentlemen , my <br> daughter , she was n't born yet , mediocre ! Eli Miller is telling you , this is not <br> the way ! " <br> Back he came to Matt . " You , you call yourself an actor ? You with <br> the rotten voice ? Jacob Adler , this was a thunder , a rotten voice is not a <br> thunder ! Maurice Schwartz , the Yiddish Art Theater , right around the corner it <br> used to be , there they did everything beautiful , Gordin , even Herzl once , <br> Hirschbein , Leivick , Ibsen , Moliere . Lear ! And whoever was there , whoever <br> saw Jacob Adler 's Lear , what they saw was not of this earth ! " <br> In a tide of laughter the audience stood up and clapped  --  a <br> volcano of applause . The laughter surged . Silkowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man off , his cape dithering behind him , his stick in the air , <br> crying Lear , Lear . Matt was still loitering there in his bare feet , watching the <br> wavering cape and the bobbing stick , when the curtain fell and hid him in the <br> dark . Many in the audience , Frances informed him later , laughed until they <br> wept . <br> Continues ...
