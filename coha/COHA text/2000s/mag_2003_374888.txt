In the seventh grade , my children read April Morning , a coming-of-age novel by Howard Fast . It 's the story of a boy , Adam Cooper , whose father is shot by the British on Lexington Common on April 19 , 1775 . In the chaos that follows , Adam joins a group of men who , in their everyday clothes , hiding behind walls and trees , mow down a column of Redcoats marching back from Concord . <P> Adam and his friends were guerrillas  --  though the word was n't commonly used until some 40 years later , when Spanish peasants harried Napoleon 's army in the Peninsular War . Indeed , the Columbia Encyclopedia notes that guerrilla tactics have been called " the great contribution of the American Revolution to the development of warfare . " In this early part of the conflict in Iraq , Saddam Hussein 's forces have borrowed heavily from that old American innovation . Now , before you send off enraged e-mail , I 'm not suggesting any moral equivalence between the Minutemen and Saddam 's thugs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American public seem to have been taken aback by the Iraqis ' hit-and-run attacks . <P> In any armed conflict , guerrilla tactics can be an equalizer . They are weapons , China 's Mao Zedong once wrote , " that a nation inferior in arms and military equipment may employ against a more powerful aggressor . " That 's precisely the situation in which Iraq now finds itself . The coalition rules the skies over Iraq  --  Saddam 's tiny air force has n't once scrambled its jets since the start of fighting  --  raining down Wagnerian fury on cities and armies . In open combat , Iraq 's armored divisions are being annihilated by allied forces . In such circumstances , it is natural for the Iraqis to resort to small-scale strikes on lightly armed targets , to avoid open combat , and to practice deception at all times . <P> It 's pointless for American generals to bleat about Iraqi irregulars not wearing uniforms or hiding behind civilians ; this is what guerrillas have always done . ( " The guerrilla must move among the people as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Our leaders in uniform would serve us better if they explained that , increasingly , guerrilla wars are the ones we will have to fight . <P> That education is overdue . The heroic narrative of American warfare stresses great , set-piece , conventional battles : Antietam and Gettysburg , Normandy and Okinawa . When a military operation departed from those norms  --  as in Vietnam and at the battle of Mogadishu in 1993  --  it was dismissed as a mistake , the consequence of political meddling rather than a cool decision by the military to use force . In fact , the ambush in Somalia by armed men indistinguishable from peaceable civilians is more relevant to our future than a full shelf of books on the World War II heroics of the " greatest generation . " Given the conventional power of the U.S. military , any probable adversary will choose unconventional tactics . The fighting in Afghanistan , for example , has settled into a classic pattern of guerrilla warfare , with hit-and-run attacks on U.S. bases followed by search-and-destroy missions by small units of American forces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
