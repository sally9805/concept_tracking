<p> One airline has painted some of its planes purple and turquoise , the colors of the Major League Baseball team it sponsors , or cardinal red , in honor of the pro football team it backs . <p> The other shuns any hint of glitz , with a fleet in subdued blue , white and gray . <p> One airline has its headquarters in an Arizona suburb known for its **33;1832;TOOLONG lifestyle . <p> The other is based in a Washington suburb that is a center for government contractors and the home of a military cemetery . <p> But last week , younger , edgier America West of Tempe , Ariz. , announced that it would merge with older , more conservative US Airways of Arlington in a $1.5 billion deal that would create one of the nation 's largest low-cost airlines . <p> Employees and Wall Street analysts asked : Would this marriage of two cultures  --  East and West , button-down and entrepreneurial  --  really work ? <p> Airline veterans say it will have to because neither US Airways Group Inc. , which posted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp. , which was $89 million in the hole , has much of a choice . <p> " We may have some cultural differences , " said John A. Taylor , a veteran US Airways pilot . " But we both want to survive . So we are looking forward to taking the best of both airlines and learning from each other . " <p> One thing the two airlines share is a history of financial trouble deep enough to send them to bankruptcy court . <p> US Airways , the nation 's seventh-largest airline , is fighting to emerge from its second Chapter 11 reorganization in three years . America West , the eighth-largest , operated under Chapter 11 protection from 1991 to 1994 . Both carriers have tried to withstand the withering effects of soaring fuel prices , profit-draining airfare wars and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 . <p> Under the merger deal , the combined airline would be called US Airways , but the company would have its headquarters in Tempe , a city of 160,000 that is a 10-minute drive from Phoenix Sky Harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by W. Douglas Parker , 43 , America West 's chief executive . US Airways chief executive Bruce R. Lakefield , 61 , would be No. 2 . <p> US Airways has more to gain from the merger , experts said , starting with some lessons it could learn from America West on customer service . <p> " When I think of America West I think of a low-cost airline that has a relatively good reputation . I would fly on them , " said Betsy R. Snyder , a credit analyst for bond-rating agency Standard &; Poor 's who follows the airline industry . <p> And when she thinks of US Airways ? <p> " Not my first choice to fly , just because of what you hear about their service , " she said . " Their inferior service . " <p> In the federal government 's most recent airline performance statistics , for flights in March , America West ranked third among 19 U.S. carriers in on-time arrivals . US Airways was 17th . <p> America West apparently also could teach its new partner how to keep track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it posted the fifth-best record in March . US Airways , which has had labor problems and staffing shortages , was 18th . <p> America West has used employee incentives to improve customer service . For example , many employees received $50 bonuses this month because the airline exceeded its on-time goal in April . <p> US Airways traces its roots to a company called All American Aviation , which in 1939 began offering the first airmail service to small towns in western Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley . The company changed its name to All American Airways in 1949 and to Allegheny Airlines in 1953 , which in 1979 changed its name to US Air , which in 1997 became US Airways , acquiring several regional airlines along the way . <p> America West 's history is a lot shorter . It was launched in 1983 with 280 employees , three Boeing 737s and a can-do spirit . <p> Originally modeled after no-frills Southwest Airlines , America West adopted a more-frills strategy , offering amenities such as newspapers , assigned seating and , later , first-class sections for passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were a very employee-friendly place , " said Michael Roach , the airline 's co-founder and first president . America West maintained a 24-hour day-care center for its flight attendants ' children . Its employees shunned labor unions . <p> By 1990 the airline had reported annual revenue of more than $1 billion and its fleet had more than 100 planes , serving 62 cities . <p> But the employees ' optimism faded as their company grew too big too fast , spending money on unprofitable long-haul routes , including one to Nagoya , Japan , and plunging into bankruptcy court in the early 1990s . <p> " That touchy-feely culture only goes so far , " said Roach , who left the company in 1984 but has followed it closely as a San Francisco-based airline industry consultant . <p> Roach said many employees turned against the man chosen to lead America West out of Chapter 11 , William A. Franke . <p> " Bill Franke was  --  is  --  very much a numbers-MBA kind of guy , " Roach said . " And the employees grew to loathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a very difficult situation , and he saved them . " <p> America West emerged from Chapter 11 in August 1994 after a partnership , which included Continental Airlines , invested $214.9 million in the company . <p> A month later , America West announced that its flight attendants had voted to be represented by the Association of Flight Attendants . The pilots , mechanics and others employee groups also turned to unions . <p> By the late 1990s , the employees often were at odds with management . And passengers noticed a deterioration in service . <p> " They had a lot of operational problems , " S &P's; Synder said . " I remember flying them in the summer of 2000 . You 'd get to the airport and you 'd look at the monitor and you 'd see the flight was delayed by two hours . It was frustrating , especially late at night . " <p> Franke retired , and Parker replaced him on Aug. 22 , 2001 . <p> A month later , after the terrorist attacks , America West trimmed its flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll . <p> The airline may not have survived the post-9/11 slowdown in air travel , Parker has said , without a $429 million loan guarantee from the federal government . <p> Parker set out to restore the airline 's image of being friendly to customers  --  and employees . <p> " Doug Parker and his team are extremely competent managers , " said Aaron J. Gellman , a professor and transportation expert at Northwestern University 's Kellogg School of Management . <p> In today 's fiercely competitive airline industry , both America West and US Airways are struggling to convince passengers that their fares rival those of discount competitors like Southwest with full-service amenities . <p> America West declared itself a low-cost carrier in 2002 . US Airways has been acting like one for several years . <p> A chart on America West 's Web site lists perks it offers that no-frill rivals do n't  --  first-class sections , airport clubs and frequent flyer awards to more than 300 destinations . <p> Among its marketing innovations , America West offers a " bill me later " ticketing option that gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a ticket . It also sells gift cards at supermarkets that can be used to pay for tickets . <p> The biggest challenge of a America West-US Airways merger may be combining the staffs of the two airlines . For example , they must decide which pilots get the choicest routes on the largest planes . US Airways has nearly 30,000 employees , America West has 14,000 . <p> " The problem is that US Airways employees who have survived are by and large senior employees , and they probably have significantly higher seniority than America West 's , " Roach said . " So their position will probably be : ' We want to merge the seniority lists based on date of hire . ' The US Airways pilots will be wanting to fly the A330s and all that good stuff . <p> " And the America West pilots will say : ... ' You would n't have any job at all without us , so we 'll fly the A330s . ' " <p> Taylor , a US Airways pilot for 22 years , said he 's optimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are represented by the same union and because they have all been through pay cuts and furloughs . <p> " Through all that pain what we have seen happen is sort of an attitude adjustment , " he said . " Our expectations have been changed . "
