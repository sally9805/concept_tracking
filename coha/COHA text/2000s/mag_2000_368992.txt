Some people get revelations in the shower . Others solve puzzles in their dreams . Yousuke Yamada , a lead engineer for the Japanese office-equipment and camera maker Ricoh Co . Ltd. , gets his best ideas on Tokyo commuter trains . " I can not create an idea at my desk , " he says . " I like to walk around a crowded train , where nobody disturbs me . " <P> Over the past three years , while his fellow commuters jostled for space or scanned the morning paper , Yamada , 55 , devoted his four-hour daily commute to a higher cause  --  dreaming up the next great consumer gadget . In 1997 Ricoh president Masamitsu Sakurai commissioned Yamada to create a device that would help catapult his company , which had built its fortunes on heavy office machines , into the forefront of digital technology . The trouble was , Sakurai did n't really know what he wanted . " The idea was to develop a product that uses all our senses , " says Yamada . " There was no paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> After reviewing the most promising new technologies  --  and meditating endlessly on the train  --  Yamada felt he was prepared to design a digital camera like no other . The fruit of his cogitations is about the size of a videocassette and weighs in at just over a pound . But the genius of the RDC-i700 camera is revealed as its top flips up to display a bright , 3.5-in. touch-sensitive screen  --  a window on the World Wide Web that surfs the Internet , records voice memos , accepts scribbled notes and drawings in 16 different colors and receives and sends e-mail . <P> In many respects , such features are not new this year . What makes the i700 an invention is its wireless Web-publishing capabilities . Ricoh engineers wrote custom software that resides inside the camera and allows users to correlate images with specific Web pages , then transmit them to a live website of their choice . Not only can you send photos from the road , you can also automatically display them exactly where you want them to appear on your website . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can be sent to a Web page and instantly published , " says the camera 's U.S. marketing manager , Jeff Lengyel . After the photographer takes pictures , which can be shot at a resolution of 3.34 megapixels or less , she selects the snaps she wants to upload to her personal website . Users in Japan  --  where the product was released in September at about $1,500  --  can transmit images with a tiny wireless modem that slides into a slot on the camera . Ricoh expects similar wireless cards to be available in time for the i700 's U.S. release early next year . <P> PICTURE PERFECT <P> In our own tests , TIME 's editors were able to upload a low-resolution image to a website in about a minute simply by selecting the desired image onscreen , then hitting a few more buttons to send it through the ether . Skeptical at first about browsing the Web on a screen the size of a drink coaster , we were pleasantly surprised at how easy it was both to enter Web addresses and write e-mail with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
