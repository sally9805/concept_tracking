<p> Ex-spy chief 's sighting reported <p> LIMA , Peru - Fugitive ex-spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos fled Peru in a yacht more than a month ago and was last seen three weeks ago on a sail boat off the coast of Costa Rica , according to testimony by three army officers broadcast Wednesday . <p> If the men 's account is true , Montesinos fled Peru on Oct. 29 , and spent a week holed up in a small hotel in the Galapagos Islands , before continuing his island-hopping escape . <p> His initial destination apparently was Venezuela . He dashed that idea when told the trip to Venezuela would require a stopover in Ecuador 's coastal city of Guayaquil , where he feared that he would be recognized . <p> Rumors as to Montesinos ' whereabouts have swirled since he returned to Peru in late September after a failed asylum bid in Panama . A videotape of Montesinos apparently bribing a congressman led to the scandal that eventually toppled President Alberto Fujimori , who is now in Japan . <p> Ex-president wo n't go to trial <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided not to try former President Alfredo Cristiani and six generals in the killings of six Jesuit priests in 1989 . <p> Justice Ana Rodriguez ruled Tuesday night that it was too late to pursue the case .

Fred Aguilar , Houston <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55923 <p> WASHINGTON - The Clinton administration is taking the rare action of invoking emergency powers to stave off electricity blackouts in the nation 's most populous state , California . <p> The state 's huge thirst for electricity combined with tight supplies and repairs at some utilities pushed California to the brink of a crisis that threatened to trigger blackouts . <p> Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the federal government would step in to require power generators and marketers to ship electricity to California to prevent blackouts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California , " Richardson told reporters after a meeting with California Sen. Dianne Feinstein , a Democrat , California Gov . Gray Davis and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief James Hoecker . <p> Richardson said he planned to invoke the government 's rarely used authority under the Federal Power Act to require out-of-state generators and marketers currently balking at selling power into California to do so immediately . <p> The California Independent System Operator , or ISO , sounded the alarm Wednesday , fearing it might have to plunge entire neighborhoods into darkness to avoid a widespread collapse of the system . <p> Officials at the ISO pointed the finger at a group of out-of-state generators and marketers they said refused to sell to California utilities . <p> The out-of-state companies feared the utilities would not be able to pay spot market prices , which have rocketed as high as $ 3,000 per megawatt , or roughly 100 times higher than one year ago . <p> Richardson also said he would cap the rates the power generators could charge for their electricity . <p> " While I will ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I will not allow them to unjustly profit due to current market conditions . I will demand a fair price . " <p> Generators responded to the situation by shipping about 5,000 megawatts of power into the state . One megawatt is enough to power about 1,000 homes . <p> The strain was further eased when service was cut to several big , industrial customers , shedding about 1,200 megawatts of electricity demand to avoid overloading the grid during the peak evening demand hours , which typically last from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m . <p> Among those power generators and marketers being ordered to supply power were Enron Power Marketing , owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. , and Portland General Electric , which Enron is in the process of selling to Nevada 's Sierra Pacific Resources . <p> Steve Kean , Enron 's chief of staff , said that because of the " pretty desperate situation " California 's ISO found itself in on Wednesday , Enron Power offered to make available 70 megawatts of power it had control over without any additional credit enhancements . The ISO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some lists being distributed by the ISO also listed Dynegy Power Marketing , owned by Houston 's Dynegy . <p> Steve Bergstrom , Dynegy 's president and chief operating officer , said the company generates power in the state of California and was somehow mixed in with the out-of-state list . <p> Bergstrom said his company had merely asked the ISO for assurances that it would be paid . Dynegy had a couple of power generating units down for maintenance work that it plans to bring back on line ahead of schedule " to try to alleviate the situation . " <p> Richardson also said he would " explore all necessary actions " to try to block Houston-based Kaiser Aluminum Corp . from selling electric power it has contracted to buy from the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration . <p> Kaiser announced plans over the weekend to shut down smelting operations in Washington state , deciding it would be more profitable to sell power than to make aluminum . Kaiser 's decision idled 400 workers , although they will receive 70 percent of their base pay . <p> " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource , I am concerned that this is coming at the expense of employees that will be out of work and that may not be fully compensated , " Richardson said . <p> Kaiser spokesman Scott Lamb said the right to resell power was something the company specifically sought when negotiating the contract . <p> Davis , calling the situation in his state " incredibly bizarre , " said he was relieved by the federal government 's decision to invoke emergency powers and help California utilities continue operating . <p> " Our objective is to keep the lights on at affordable rates , " Davis said . <p> Davis , a frequent critic of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , blamed the growing crisis on that agency 's move last Friday to raise wholesale price caps on electricity . <p> Davis said rocketing prices in the electricity spot market threatened to drain the cash reserves of the state 's two major utilities , Edison International 's SoCal Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co . <p> Davis and other state officials have repeatedly criticized FERC for failing to be aggressive enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis and Feinstein reiterated their call for FERC to immediately adopt price caps for the entire western region . They said the current situation allows California 's neighbors to manipulate the market and dramatically overcharge state utilities for power . <p> " California is ripe for electricity price gouging , " Feinstein told reporters . <p> She cautioned that the situation was so dire that farmers were asking state and federal officials for help in protecting citrus groves that require electricity during cold snaps . <p> Some California businesses also were being forced to choose between paying exorbitant power bills or closing their doors , she said . <p> Hoecker promised that FERC would act soon to help remedy the California power crunch . <p> " The commission will take strong action soon , " Hoecker said . He declined to elaborate , saying that the agency would issue its plan at a public meeting Friday . <p> " I want to assure " California officials " that FERC will be part of the solution , not part of the problem , " Hoecker added . <p> The crisis marks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to completely deregulate its electricity markets in the hope of spurring competition - has been rocked by volatile electricity and natural gas prices . <p> Last summer , tight supplies and hot weather briefly tripled consumer electricity bills in Southern California , unleashing a storm of protest from consumer activists , state lawmakers and the governor . <p> Supplies once again tightened late last month due to a combination of high demand by California 's booming economy , the temporary closure of several power plants for repairs , and meager electricity available from hydropower generators in the Pacific Northwest . <p> California homeowners have been urged to use Christmas lights and decorations sparingly , and federal government offices on the U.S. West Coast have curtailed use of lights , computers and escalators to save power . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55924 <p> AUSTIN - Gov . George W. Bush , who prevailed in the closest presidential ballot count in history , ascends to the nation 's highest office after a meteoric trip through Texas politics that capitalized on his privileged family roots and a knack for pleasing the masses . <p> Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Jan. 20 . But because of the razor-thin margin of his win and the acrimonious post-election dispute , he wo n't take national office with the depth of popular and political support he enjoyed when leading his home state . <p> Bush became Texas ' 46th governor in 1995 after he toppled the popular incumbent Ann Richards , despite having a resume devoid of governing experience . He compensated for that shortcoming with hard work , loyal advisers , generous donors and good timing , arriving in the state capital amid good economic times and a clamor for major policy reforms . <p> Using skills acquired in part from his father , former President Bush , and honed during three legislative sessions , the 54-year-old former oilman and baseball team owner disproved naysayers who believed his surname and conservative agenda would n't be enough . <p> As governor , Bush 's formula for success was relatively simple , a precursor of his presidential campaign . He set a limited number of policy goals , all based on conservative values , and then delivered on his public promises with the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little choice but to collaborate with him . <p> Though Bush often proclaimed the governor 's job was the best job he 'd ever had , he began eyeing the presidency in 1997 at the urging of followers . For Bush , the time was ripe for new challenges . <p> By the start of the 2000 campaign , Bush had enacted most of his major state policy initiatives . He and his wife , Laura , had become accustomed to the grueling side of public service . His twin 19-year-old daughters , Jenna and Barbara , were preparing to leave home for college . He was financially well off and even had a new personal playground - a Central Texas ranch that serves as a haven from unwanted attention . <p> Bush had barreled into the Governor 's Mansion with 53 percent of the vote in defeating Richards , the Democratic incumbent . His successful strategy was to focus on policy , avoid personal attacks on Richards , wooing conservative Democrats and making new inroads with minority voters . <p> The going was much easier in 1998 , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and became the first governor in modern Texas history to win consecutive four-year terms . By then he had amassed a pile of legislative victories after championing causes , including lawsuit and welfare reform , school accountability and tax relief . <p> The legislative achievements were part luck , part genius , coming in a period of changing demographics that made conservative proposals easier to enact in the Legislature . Anti-crime bills , a crackdown on juvenile delinquency and other initiatives were all pushed through with bipartisan support ( and the aid of the late Democratic Lt. Gov . Bob Bullock , who took a liking to Bush . ) <p> Bush 's political acumen at times seemed to come more from observing his father 's career and on-the-job training than from paying political dues . <p> Still , there were no early indicators that Bush was headed to a life in politics . <p> Raised in Midland , Bush began his education there in public schools before being sent to a private Massachusetts prep school . After studying at Yale and Harvard , Bush , then a congressman 's son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1975 . He took his initial plunge into politics in 1978 when he made a failed bid for a West Texas congressional seat . <p> It would be 16 years later before he would test the political waters again . By then he had assembled a trusted team of advisers , including Don Evans , Karen Hughes and Karl Rove , all of whom still remain part of Bush 's team . His ability to raise copious amounts of campaign money , in part though a network of his dad 's friends , gave Bush another advantage when he embarked on his gubernatorial quest . <p> His job immediately before becoming governor was as managing general partner of the Arlington-based Texas Rangers baseball club , a role he assumed in 1989 after he parlayed a relatively small investment of $ 600,000 and several friendships into a lucrative stake in the team . He sold his interest in 1998 for $ 15 million . <p> Before that , Bush was a Midland oilman with the usual mix of good and bad luck . It was there that he met librarian Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some tough times in the Oil Patch , grew the nest egg that helped him buy into the Rangers . <p> Midland is also the place that taught Bush an invaluable political lesson , he would later claim . Some people did n't vote for him there in 1978 because he never met with them personally to ask for their votes . He recalled that fact at almost every campaign stop during the presidential race . Consequently , he adapted an accessible style that prompted him to delve into crowds , shake every hand within reach , look potential voters in the eye and plead for their help . <p> As he campaigned for the presidency in 46 states - all but Alaska , Hawaii , Montana and Idaho - Bush stuck with the formula that helped him in Texas . Aided by a well-funded team of professionals and volunteers , he stayed on time , on message and on guard , deftly deflecting pointed inquiries from the media and public . <p> In town-hall meetings during the GOP primaries , he was hit with questions about his lack of federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefree college student ; and his proposals to cut federal taxes and rescue senior entitlement programs . Bush also endured tedious grilling over his support for the death penalty and opposition to abortion . <p> Some of the toughest attacks came from within his own party as Bush weathered a series of lackluster wins and resounding defeats in the GOP primaries and caucuses . But even his harshest critic , U.S. Sen. John McCain , came around to endorse Bush and helped him woo support from independent voters eager for campaign finance reforms . <p> Though Bush has vowed to work toward those reforms , he made tax relief his major objective , along with improving the nation 's schools and insuring the solvency of the Social Security and Medicaid programs . In speech after speech , Bush , who joined the Texas Air National Guard in 1968 , also lamented the state of U.S. defenses , belittled the moral climate in the Clinton White House and said he would keep three things paramount in his life - his Christian faith , his family and his country . <p> TYPE : @ @ @
