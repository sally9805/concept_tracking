At Antietam , " Old Rock " Benning held the crossing as long as his ammunition held out-and until the 51st Pennsylvania got its whiskey . // AMERICANS EVEN MILDLY acquainted with Civil War history know it on sight , three graceful stone arches spanning lazy , tree-lined Antietam Creek just east of Sharpsburg , Maryland . Beside it spreads a huge , graceful sycamore that was little more than a sapling on September 17 , 1862 , when more than 22,000 Americans were killed and maimed across the adjacent farmland in the bloodiest day in American history . About 25 years old at the time of the battle , it was called the Rohrbach Bridge back then , but has since been known as Burnside 's Bridge . General Robert E. Lee commanded for the South , and Maj. Gen. George McClellan for the North . Bobby Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia was outnumbered 2-to-l , and even that superb soldier should have been destroyed in the desperate fighting , if only McClellan had attacked all along the line at once . But " Little Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timid in battle , sent his Army of the Potomac into the attack piecemeal . The dusty blue lines advanced a section at a time , starting generally at the northwest end of Lee 's long , diagonal front , and working down to the southeast . Again and again the dogged Union infantry came within a hair 's breadth of victory . Again and again , in the nick of time , Lee moved troops to the threatened spot to plug his leaking lines . And so the ferocious fighting continued through the long , hot day , back and forth across pastureland and fields of standing crops and patches of dark-green woodland . Minie balls and artillery shells slashed down both men and the standing corn with brutal efficiency . A sunken road filled up with corpses , stacked two and three deep . As a soldier of the 9th New York wrote , " The whole landscape for an instant turned slightly red .... " As the fighting dragged on into the heat of the afternoon , Lee had lost some ground , but his lines still held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help was on the way . Coming up from Harpers Ferry , driving his men in a furious forced march , Maj. Gen. A.P . Hill was pushing his Light Division hard for Sharpsburg . Meanwhile , behind the Union lines , McClellan , forever prone to overestimate Lee 's strength , hesitated in committing Maj. Gen. Fitzjohn Porter 's fine V Corps , nor would he hurry on an attack he had already directed . Down on the left of his line stood the LX Corps , commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside , a bluff , honest man . he cut an imposing figure , tall and strong , his jaws bedecked with thickets of whiskers to which he would lend his name . Everybody liked Burnside . His troops knew he was a brave man , and that he cared about them immensely . What they could not know was how inert he would be this day . // During the Battle of Antietam , soldiers of the 51st Pennsylvania and 51st New York Infantry regiments are picked off by troops of the 2nd and 20th Georgia Infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting . // During the Battle of Antietam , soldiers of the 51st Pennsylvania and 51st New York Infantry regiments are picked off by troops of the 2nd and 20th Georgia Infantry regiments Defending the Heights , in Walter G. Buble 's painting . // Burnside 's Bridge , by Don Troiani , depicts the action from the Union side of Antietam Creek , as the 51st Pennsylvania makes its first attempt to dash across the bridge that would come to bear the name of its IX Corps commander , MaJ. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. // Burnside was miffed at receiving a rather silly reprimand from McClellan , who the newspapers delighted in calling the " Young Napoleon . " Burnside apparently was going to limit himself to strictly obeying orders on this occasion , and the Young Napoleon would not make up for his subordinates lassitude . The stage was set for a bloody farce on the Federal left . At about 9 a.m. , as the roar of violent , bloody fighting swelled up on the right of the Union line , McClellan sent Burnside an order to attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Burnsides advance could help them by drawing off some of Lee 's thin-stretched troops . In front of Burnsides men lay some open , flat ground and then Antietam Creek , west of which the ground rose sharply to some steep little hills crowned with brush and trees . Antietam Creek is about 50 feet wide at this point , but its current is slow . Though the water near the bridge was between 4 and 5 feet deep , after the heat of summer the creek in many other places was as low as 3 feet . The creek , however , was deceptively hard to ford for men in full gear , trying to keep their powder dry . Locating another crossing point should have been a high priority , but McClellan had further complicated matters by keeping all the cavalry at his headquarters . The troopers should have been out on reconnaissance missions , prying into such vital things as handy shallow crossing-places . Somebody had heard there was a crossing downstream of the bridge called Snavely s Ford . Instead of making a serious search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find some local citizen who might know about the ford . They found nobody-at least nobody who would tell them anything . They did eventually discover a ford , but it turned out to be below a high , steep bluff , and the soldiers could not scramble down to it . When somebody finally did find Snavely 's Ford , it turned out to be a long way downstream , and a whole Union division spent most of the day wandering through the brush before it finally got across Antietam Creek . Meanwhile the sun had long passed noon , and opportunity was fleeing . All this milling about suited Lee entirely . he could spare very few troops for his far right . Nearly every man he had was locked in furious combat farther northwest . There were no reserves at all available to send to the handful of men assigned to defend the Antietam crossing . Fortunately for Lee , the defenders were very hard men indeed . Mostly they belonged to two understrength rifle regiments , the 2nd and 20th Georgia Infantry of fire-eating Brig . Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered along the creek bank to their right , but around the bridge , it all depended on the Georgians . They held the high ground above the creek , and aside from a little artillery help they were alone . The commander on the spot was Colonel Henry L. Benning . His men called him " Old Rock . " Tall and dignified , Benning at 48 was hardly old , but a rock he certainly was . Before the war he had been a prominent Georgia lawyer , and for some years had served as chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court . Now he was an experienced leader of infantry , and he knew a fine defensive position when he saw it . He posted his two small regiments along the high ground west of the creek . There was plenty of cover there , a fine stone wall and the remaining pits from the quarrying that had harvested the stone for the bridge . The Rebels further improved on their defenses with fallen trees and fence rails . A few of them climbed up into some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man could find a branch to steady his gun on or a trunk to shield his body . Nothing could move in the open ground across the creek without those sharpshooters seeing it . Benning posted about 400 men to cover the bridge itself ; he could spare no more . A farm road wandered west from Pleasant Valley , met Antietarn Creek about a quarter of a mile downstream of the Rohrbach Bridge , then ran parallel with the water up to the bridge . The distance between the Rebel positions and the bridge was only about 100 yards , murderously close for rifle muskets . Photograph A view of the Rohrbach Bridge from the southwest , photographed by Alexander Gardner after the battle . Little-changed 142 years later , the placid setting leaves it to battlefield visitors to imagine the bloody series of assaults by elements of the Union IX Corps. // At about 10 p.m. the Union effort concentrated on the stone bridge as the 11 th Connecticut came down the farm road and spread out into a skirmish line along the water . The Connecticut men gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who appeared to them mostly as puffs of smoke in the woods across the creek . A courageous captain of the 11 th led a party out to wade across the stream . The task proved fruitless , however , as Georgia Minie balls cut down the waterlogged foot soldiers . When its regimental commander fell mortally wounded , the lfth Connecticut fell back , a third of its men out of the fight . THE VALIANT CONNECTICUT effort was intended to cover an attack by Colonel George Crook 's brigade of Ohio infantry . Sadly , the Ohio boys marched down to find the crossing and missed the bridge entirely-another mishap caused by the absence of cavalry reconnaissance . At the creek they began to take fire from the heights on the other side , so they found cover behind fences and trees and shot back . And there they stayed . About an hour and a half after the repulse of the 11 th Connecticut , the 2nd Maryland and the 6th New Hampshire came down the country road and charged upstream , turning their left flank to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover them , and Union artillery ripped the western hillside with shot and shell , but they failed to prevent the dug-in Georgians from resuming their turkey-shoot . There was fire from Confederate artillery , too , and the third Union advance collapsed . In just a few minutes , the Marylanders had taken 44 percent casualties . It was by then noon . Couriers had been arriving from McClellan , trying to hurry Burnside on . Burnside was at his headquarters , a half-mile from the point of decision , three hours behind schedule and still not showing much interest in pressing home any kind of effective assault . AT LAST MCCLELLAN 'S inspector general , Colonel Delos B. Sackett , galloped up to relay the Young Napoleons directive to attack again at any cost . Burnside , still on his high horse , petulantly remarked , " McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge . " But at least Burnside issued some more orders to Brig . Gen. Samuel Sturgis ' division , the same unit that had launched the last abortive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Ferrero , commanding Sturgis ' 2nd Brigade . Back in a little valley , perhaps 200 yards from the bridge , Ferrero rode up to find the men he thought might give Burnside his precious bridge-veterans of the 51st New York and the 51st Pennsylvania . The Pennsylvanians had a reputation for finding whiskey where nobody else could find water . Their beloved daily booze ration depended on good behavior , however , and for some reason Ferrero had recently cut it off . They were good soldiers , but the loss of their whiskey still rankled . Now both the New Yorkers and Pennsylvanians watched their commander 's familiar face somberly , guessing what was coming . Ferrero looked them over and raised his voice : " It is General Burnside 's especial request that the two 51 sts take that bridge . Will you do it ? " The answer came clearly , an anonymous voice from somewhere back in the ranks of the Pennsylvanians . " Will you give us our whiskey , Colonel , if we take it ? " Ferrero was a tough disciplinarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by God ! " the little colonel roared with laughter , " if I have to send to New York to get it ! " His men broke into cheers . Ferrero had seen the horrible results of approaching the bridge up the creek side road . This time , instead of exposing his soldiers ' flank to that murderous musketry , he elected to go straight for the bridge across the open ground just east of it . A couple of Union artillery batteries got into position just upstream , where they could sweep the Rebel positions , and began to tear at that deadly hillside with swaths of cannister . Ferrero s two other regiments added their gunfire , and about 12:30 the Pennsylvanians and New Yorkers started their rush for the bridge . The Georgia rifles cut scores of them down as they followed their colors across 300 yards of open ground , but the survivors made the foot of the bridge . Sensing that they could not achieve their goal in a single rush , the Pennsylvanians hunkered down behind a stone wall upstream from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behind a rail fence . From there , as a Union lieutenant wrote with more enthusiasm than good spelling , " We were then ordered to halt and commence firing , and the way we showered the lead across that creek was noboddys business . " Photograph Left : Burnside 's handling of his IX Corps was dutiful but unimaginative . Below left : Commanding the 2nd and 20th Georgia regiments of Brig . Gen. Robert A. Toombs ' brigade overlooking the bridge , Colonel Henry Benning lived up to his nickname , " Old Rock . " // Up on the high ground across the little stream , Rock Benning 's Georgians were nearing the end of their tether . A ceaseless shower of canister , shell fragments and Minie balls howled about their ears . They had been fighting hard for three solid hours , they were horribly tired and , worst of all , they were running out of ammunition . And so , a few at a time , the Confederates began to pull back . Down along the bank Colonel Robert Potter waved his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the New Yorkers roared across , jostling for elbowroom with the 51st Pennsylvania . Out in front of the Pennsylvanians was Captain William Allebaugh , commanding C Company , and with him were the precious colors and his first sergeant . Behind trampled a river of yelling men and a thicket of flashing bayonets . Pennsylvania Colonel John Hartranft stood against the stone bridge , waving his hat , his voice almost lost from urging his soldiers on . " Come on , boys , " he gasped , " I ca n't haloo any more ! " As the two Slsts crossed the bridge , the whole east bank erupted in cheers . However badly their leaders had failed , the Union infantry had done very well indeed-they were entitled to yell a little . Rock Benning was a scrapper , but he was also a realist . His men could hold no longer ; no men could . With the ammunition gone , he gave the order to fall back . Most of the remaining men of the 2nd and 20th Georgia obeyed , leaving their pits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high ground . A few surrendered ; not many . One little band would not quit : Lt. Col. William Holmes of the 2nd Georgia , sword in hand , led a forlorn , quixotic little counterattack down the slope . It broke up under a storm of Union musketry , and Holmes went down . So the Young Napoleon had the bridge , and Burnside could say he had obeyed orders . The soldiers on both sides had suffered horribly . The commander of the 2nd Georgia was dead , and more than half his men were casualties . Down below , in the wake of the last Union charge , lay more than 200 Pennsylvanians and New Yorkers . Altogether , about 500 Yankees and perhaps 120 Rebels had been killed or wounded in this vicious little fight . Behind the 51st Pennsylvania and 51st New York , more soldiers from the IX Corps streamed across the river . A little to the north , Crook 's Ohioans finally managed to wade to the west bank , and at last the wandering division to the south got over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on Lee 's right flank now , with perhaps 1,200 yards left to cut the Army of Northern Virginia off from the Potomac fords and any hope of survival . General Toombs had pulled back to a stone wall about half a mile west of the bridge . It was the last place he could fight-a forlorn hope , certainly , but Toombs , Benning and their men would stick it out to the very end . Photograph Gardner photographed these dead Rebels near the bridge . The Georgians had delayed the Yankees just long enough for MaJ. Gen. A.P . Hill 's Light Division to arrive . // Victory still lay tantalizingly just out of McClellan 's grasp . For one thing , the leading Federal division had used almost all its cartridges , and , on this day of blunders , nobody had seen to resupplying it . That division was replaced by another one and went back to replenish its ammunition , all of which took time . A monumental bottleneck developed on the bridge as troops got in one another 's way . Burnside came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hours passed for the Union Di Corps , while up the road from Harpers Ferry came Nemesis , in this case named Ambrose Powell Hill . Hill pushed his ragged , sweating men mercilessly northward . Those who could not keep up dropped by the wayside or hobbled along in the dust behind his column . AFTER AN HOUR OR SO of milling around , refilling cartridge boxes and getting reorganized , the Union advance from the bridge resumed . Much of the rest of the battlefield had quieted down , both sides being pretty well fought out in the hideous bloodbath of the morning . McClellan still had all his cavalry and a fresh infantry corps , but as usual he dithered , his head filled with visions of hordes of imaginary Rebels . The final push to victory , then , would have to come from Burnside 's men . There were two divisions abreast , each with an extra brigade attached , pushing inexorably west toward Lee 's flank and rear , with fewer than 2,800 Rebels in a position to stop them . The Confederates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very much alive to the danger , was sending more artillery over to his right . The terrain was good defensive ground , too , cut by ravines and gullies , crossed by stone walls and rail fences where riflemen could steady their weapons . Burnside 's men made steady progress , accompanied to their right by a rough division of experienced Regulars from the neighboring corps . Although the Young Napoleon had promised to support Burnside , he failed to issue the necessary orders , and just as the Regulars were on the verge of punching a hole in the thin Rebel line before them , he recalled them . Still , Burnside 's corps pushed on , " as thick , " a Rebel wrote , " as Pharaohs locusts . " The Union troops cleared Confederate positions with the bayonet , running in yelling through a miasma of dust , powder smoke and roundshot that bowled over and dismembered their comrades . As they closed with the Confederate batteries , the Rebels switched to canister and grapeshot , tearing great gaps in the blue lines . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed on , and the guns retreated before them . Now the blue lines stormed forward toward a rail fence , where they and a line of grim gray men murdered each other at 50 yards until the outnumbered Rebels finally broke and ran . The flag of the United States could be seen from Sharpsburg , where Lee himself was rallying tired men , while Confederate ambulances pushed through the crowded ways . Union shells whistled into the town , knocking down pieces of masonry and glass on the tumult below . With nothing left to send to his faltering right , Lee rode to a little knoll above the town , squinting toward the south and southeast , into the afternoon sun . He needed a miracle . Looking past the debacle on his right , Lee could see movement to the south . A.R Hill and a few of his staff had galloped into Sharpsburg on spent horses about 2:30 p.m. , but his troops were still panting up the Harpers Ferry road , while the hammer of Federal musketry came closer . Holding tightly to hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointed to a hurlying column to the south and west , and asked , " What troops are those ? " Photograph Promoted to brigadier general for his division 's valor at Burnside 's Bridge , Edward Ferrero did not forget his promise to his men . // The young man looked through his glass and said he thought some of them were Union soldiers . " And the others ? " asked his general . " What are they ? " The officer squinted into his glass again . " They are flying the Virginia and Confederate flags . " It was Hill 's Light Division , which had covered 17 miles in seven hours , a prodigious march in the summer heat . It was strung out and lathered and panting , but its blood was up , and it was coming in on the flank of an unsuspecting enemy . Some Northern soldiers believed that red-bearded A. P. Hill 's bellicosity stemmed from a long-ago rivalry with McClellan to wed lovely Ellen Marcy , who finally married Little Mac . On one occasion , as Hill 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have grouched , " God 's sake , Nelly-why did n't you marry him ? " The tale was probably a myth , but Hill 's ferocity in combat was real enough . Now he threw his men into action as they came up . Screeching the Rebel yell , they slammed into the flank of the disorganized Union units moving west . Unit by unit , the Northern advance ground to a halt , then began to recoil . Men fell in hundreds-a division commander was killed on each side-but Hill had the initiative , and he would keep it , backed by more than 40 cannons collected east of Sharpsburg . In the end , Burnside 's men were driven back almost to the bridge , losing most of the afternoons gains-almost everything but that damnable bridge . At that point McClellan , though he knew that his left flank might be driven clear back through the creek , still dithered . Still he refused to commit any of the 5,500 fresh troops quietly waiting for his orders , who had yet to fire a shot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lines , Hill 's exhausted men broke contact and the worst day of carnage in American history was over . Before long , night fell . All across the ghastly fields around Sharpsburg danced little glimmering corpse-lights , the lanterns of medical personnel searching for wounded men . Out on the battlefield burning haystacks glowed with fire in the gloaming , a soft , sweet evening hideous with the screams and moans of horribly hurt men . They cried for water , they cried for their mothers and in their delirium they still fought the battle , calling on comrades silent and dead in the fields beside them . The surgeons worked desperately through the night to save whomever could be saved . With them worked a tough , tireless woman named Clara Barton . Lee spent the next day at Sharpsburg , brazenly staring McClellan down , then slipped away south in darkness , to rest and recruit in Winchester . Hill had arrived in the nick of time to save his army . McClellan , Burnside and others had fumbled away a great opportunity , but even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes that cost the North its victory were the gift of Henry Benning and a handful of stringy , sunburned Georgia foot soldiers . Benning , his superior reported , had fought his little force with " distinguished coolness , courage and skill . he deserves the special consideration of the Government . " From President Abraham Lincoln 's viewpoint , a couple of good things did come out of the awful slaughter at Antietam . Although McClellan had failed to win a decisive victory , at least he had not lost , and he had killed , wounded or captured one-third of the Army of Northern Virginia . Lincoln made use of that as his chance to shake the South-and mold the future-with an astonishing announcement called the Emancipation Proclamation . Then in November Lincoln sacked McClellan . Little Mac 's replacement , unfortunately , was the plodding Burnside , the first of a series of short-lived command failures who would get a lot of good soldiers killed . But at least a beginning was made , a beginning that in time would produce George Gordon Meade and Ulysses Simpson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richly deserved promotion for his day 's work at Antietam . The 51st Pennsylvania was at the ceremony , of course , and it still had something to say . As Ferrero sat on his horse among the music and the flags , an anonymous voice piped up from behind : " How about that whiskey ? " Ferrero turned his head and replied , smiling , " You 'll get it . " And they did , a whole keg of it , that very day . No doubt they drank the health of the new brigadier general . Henry Benning fought out the rest of the war . he was seriously wounded in the Battle of the Wilderness . But he returned to duty and walked the rest of a long , bleak road with the Army of Northern Virginia . he ended the war as a brigadier general , and he was still in harness on that dreary April 9 , 1865 , when Lee 's boys stacked arms for the last time . Then Benning went back to Georgia and hung up his sword . he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth in the voices of old Georgia soldiers when they spoke of the time they held the Antietam bridge for Old Rock , trading blood for hours to save an army . The U.S. Army , which reveres scrappers , remembers Henry Benning . For a long time , young officers from all over the United States have gone to a big post in Georgia to learn to lead , and men are trained there as paratroopers , rangers and Green Berets . The post , which calls itself the " Home of the Infantry , " is named Fort Benning . Old Rock would have liked that .
