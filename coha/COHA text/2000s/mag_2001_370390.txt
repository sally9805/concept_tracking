Biotech Goes to School <P> In Europe , protests against the biotech industry are a staple of the news . Now a trade group is mounting a counterattack starting in classrooms . In April , 600 schools in Scotland were sent 84,000 copies of a magazine called Your World : Biotechnology &; You . Produced by the Biotechnology Institute , an industry-funded organization based in Washington , the magazine features stories on transgenic animals and other biotech wonders . A recent issue highlights Monsanto 's herbicide Roundup ; another features a girl who took Prozac and " felt like herself again . " Since 1999 , 4,500 U.S. schools have received the magazine , to little protest . But in Scotland , industry critics are predictably furious . " Biotech companies are n't interested in education , " says Matthew Herbert of the protest group Scottish Genetix Action . " They 're selling products . " Publisher Jeff Davidson replies , " We 're trying to encourage scientific literacy and debate . " <P> Alien Plague <P> They 're the smallest of stowaways , hitching rides on freighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're invasive species , including insects , fish , fungi and plants . Their variety , and the damage they inflict on local species and crops , is growing apace with the doubling in U.S. foreign trade over the past decade . In the U.S. , they cause upwards of $100 billion in economic losses annually , according to Cornell researcher David Pimentel . Among recent invaders is giant salvinia , a freshwater weed infesting lakes and waterways in the South and West . The Asian long-horn beetle , pictured at right , is gnawing away at Chicago-area trees . In April , environmentalists filed a suit to force the EPA to bar oceangoing vessels from dumping their ballast water  --  a major source of invasive species  --  in U.S. ports . So far , California and Washington are the only states requiring ships from foreign harbors to flush their ballast at sea before docking . <P> DRILLERS " SEE " UNDERGROUND <P> Dick Cheney 's old company , Halliburton , agreed in April to pay $100 million for Magic Earth of Houston , which makes images like the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seismic data and , along with soaring energy prices , are helping drive the global oil-and-gas-exploration business . Magic Earth 's " data-mining " software provides geologists with color-coded guides to rock formations and fluid densities . Its visual clues , says CEO Michael Zeitlin , can be analyzed more quickly and accurately than reams of numbers and graphs . And its improved accuracy means drilling fewer dry holes , reducing cost and environmental impact . Claims Zeitlin : " We 've improved the probability of striking oil from 1 in 10 to 4 in 10 . " <P> The Price of Protectionism I : U.S. Steel <P> Faced with rising health-care costs and a global glut of their product , America 's steelmakers are demanding more protection from imports . A bill before Congress would impose import quotas that might save 3,700 steelmaking jobs in the U.S. But higher costs for U.S. industries that use steel , such as autos and construction , would result in the loss of 19,000 to 32,000 jobs , according to a new study sponsored by the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition . Andrew Sharkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls the study " flawed " and " based on a political agenda that defends dumped , subsidized and disruptive steel imports . "
