Down a dirt road , amid rolling hills of alfalfa , Larry and Madonna Sorell 's 40-acre spread looks , smells and sounds like any other Kansas homestead . The weathered wooden farmhouse . The whiff of manure . The cacophony of grunting , gobbling and bleating . But the livestock at Lazy S Farms are no ordinary farm animals . Rooting about in the fields are Red Wattle pigs , a breed thought to have been imported from New Caledonia in the 1700s and practically extinct until a wild herd surfaced in Texas . The turkeys are Standard American Bronzes , which were Thanksgiving fare for more than a century but have now been reduced to some 950 breeder birds . The lambs are Katahdins , a subspecies developed in Maine and named for the state 's highest peak . <P> Fifty years ago , such breeds were common on family farms . But with the intensive post  --  World War II industrialization of American agriculture , they all but died out , surviving only on isolated farmsteads for local consumption . In the past five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now rare varieties , thanks to a lively network of big-name chefs , conservation-minded farmers and slow-food devotees . Like heirloom tomatoes and antique roses , so-called heritage meats are attracting discriminating customers  --  and fetching top dollar . <P> For Larry Sorell , 65 , a fourth-generation grain planter , raising rare animals began as a lark . But as he learned more about the threat to the survival of traditional varieties , he came to see his hobby as a higher calling . " If a breed goes extinct , all the genetics go down the tube , " he says . Besides , he adds as he waters a passel of squealing piglets , " I just love to watch ' em grow . " <P> Sorell 's pigs are n't the only things that are growing . Heritage Foods USA , the largest mail-order firm in the business , was buying five 200-lb. hogs a month from Lazy S but is ratcheting up to 25 a month to meet demand . Besides Red Wattles , named for their ruddy hair and folds of neck skin , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Tunis lamb to Bourbon Red turkeys . " Dozens of delicious American treasures with a long history are on the brink of extinction , " says Patrick Martins , co-founder of the company . " We must eat them to save them . " <P> The renewed interest in rare breeds is driven in part by the limited offerings of factory farms in the U.S. Agribusinesses , trying to maximize efficiency in a competitive market , pursue a ruthless genetic specialization , driving the industry toward what ecologists call monocultures  --  vast numbers of a single variety . According to the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy ( ALBC ) , 15 different breeds of pigs were raised for market in the 1930s ; today , six of them are extinct . Only three varieties  --  Hampshire , Yorkshire and Duroc  --  account for 75% of U.S. production . In the 1920s , some 60 breeds of chickens thrived on American farms ; today one hybrid , the Cornish Rock cross , supplies nearly every supermarket . A single turkey dominates : the Broad Breasted White , a fast-growing commercial creation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to mate naturally .
