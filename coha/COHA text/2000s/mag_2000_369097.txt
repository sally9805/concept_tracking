The postelection stage groaned with a menagerie of personages vying for attention : politicians , judges , lawyers , talking heads . Yet who proved himself  --  once again  --  the craftiest , the savviest pol of them all ? Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist . <P> It began with the unanimous first opinion he coaxed out of a court deeply and obviously divided on the matter of Bush v. Gore . Its beauty was its subtlety . Indeed , it was so subtle that it took three days for the TV mavens to figure it out . At first , they thought the court had merely ducked . In fact , it had issued a veiled but devastating rebuke to the Florida Supreme Court for creating a new deadline for certifying Florida 's presidential election . <P> By vacating that decision with a mere query , the Rehnquist court strained to keep from humiliating its Florida subordinate . But the query  --  Could you kindly provide justification for a decision that appears baseless ?  --  sent a pointed message to the willful Florida justices . <P> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At oral argument , you could almost see Chief Justice Charles Wells and a few of his colleagues looking over their shoulder wondering whether Rehnquist &; Co. would approve of their behavior . <P> But a willful majority of four justices decided to take Rehnquist up on his challenge . Despite Wells ' warning that by ordering a partial statewide recount  --  something with " no foundation in the law of Florida "  --  they were inviting rebuke and reversal by the U.S. Supreme Court , they forged ahead and opened up yet another chapter in the recount saga . <P> But this one threatened a constitutional crisis : the collision of legislatures and courts of a kind unseen in more than a century . Re-enter the Rehnquist court . Amid the chaos , somebody had to play Daddy . Its earlier admonition having been ignored , the Supreme Court eschewed subtlety this time and bluntly stopped the Florida Supreme Court in its tracks  --  and stayed its willfulness . By 5-4 , mind you , and Rehnquist does n't like 5-4 in questions of this magnitude . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court to assert itself and thus bring a welcome finality to the postelection madness . <P> It was a high moment  --  first deft , then bold  --  that served to reinforce the high court 's supremacy . But Rehnquist could only do so because for nearly two decades he has , against the odds , maintained the Supreme Court 's prestige and mystique . This week he cashed in , but he had been building the capital for years . At a time when respect for every other institution of government has declined precipitously , the country still looks to the Supreme Court for authority and finality . <P> Polls routinely show trust in the Supreme Court exceeding that of Congress and the presidency , to say nothing of the press , which ranks down there with lawyers . Asked who should be involved in deciding this election , 60% said the Supreme Court , and only 38% said either Congress or the Florida legislature . <P> How does Rehnquist do it ? There are many answers . One , often overlooked , is paramount . Rehnquist has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the courtroom .
