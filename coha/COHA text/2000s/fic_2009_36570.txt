Librarian Paige Rogers had survived more exciting days dodging bullets to protect her country . Given a choice , she 'd rather be battling assassins than collecting overdue fines . For that matter , running down terrorists had a lot more appeal than running down lost books . Oh , the regrets of life-woven with guilt , get-over-its , and move-ons . But do-overs were impossible , and the adventures of her life were now shelved alphabetically under fiction . <p> Time to reel in my pitiful attitude and get to work . Paige stepped onto her front porch with what she needed for a full workday at the library . Already , perspiration dotted her face , a reminder of the rising temperatures . Before locking the door behind her , she scanned the front yard and surveyed the opposite side of the dusty road , where chestnut-colored quarter horses grazed on sparse grass . Torrid heat and no rain , as though she stood on African soil . But here , nothing out of the ordinary drew her attention . Just the way she liked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel-efficient car , she felt for the Beretta Px4 under the seat . The past could rear its ugly head without warning . Boy Scouts might be prepared ; Girl Scouts were trained . The radio blared out the twang of a guitar and the misery of a man who 'd lost his sweetheart to a rodeo star . Paige laughed at the irony of it all . <p> She zipped down the road , her tires crunching the grasshoppers that littered the way before her . In the rearview mirror , she saw birds perched on a barbed wire fence and a few defiant wildflowers . They held on to their roots in the sun-baked dirt the way she clutched hope . The radio continued to croon out one tune after another all the way into the small town of Split Creek , Oklahoma , ten klicks from nowhere . <p> After parking her car in the designated spot in front of the library , Paige hoisted her tote bag onto her shoulder and grabbed a book about Oklahoma history and another by C. S. Lewis . The latter had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense out of the sordid events of her past . She scraped the grasshoppers from her shoes and onto the curb . The pests were everywhere this time of year . Reminded her of a few gadflies she 'd been forced to trust overseas . She 'd swept the crusty hoppers off her porch at home and the entrance to the library as she 'd done with the shadow makers of the past . But nothing could wipe the nightmares from her internal hard drive . <p> Her gaze swept the quiet business district with an awareness of how life could change in the blink of an eye . A small land scaping of yellow marigolds and sapphire petunias stretched toward the sky in front of the newly renovated , one-hundred-year-old courthouse . Its high pillars supported a piece of local history ... and the secrets of the best of families . Business owners unlocked their stores and exchanged morning greetings . Paige recognized most of the dated cars and dusty pickups , but a black Town Car with tinted glass and an Oklahoma license plate parked on the right side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone sporting a luxury car want to venture into Split Creek , population 1,500 ? The lazy little town did n't offer much more than a few antique stores , a small library , a beauty shop , Dixie 's Donuts , a Piggly Wiggly , four churches-including one First Baptist and one South First Baptist , each at opposite ends of town , one First Methodist , and a holiness tabernacle right beside Denim 's Restaurant . She wanted to believe it was an early visitor to the courthouse . Maybe someone lost . But those thoughts soon gave way to curiosity and a twist of suspicion . <p> With a smile intended to be more appealing than a Fourth of July storefront , she crossed the street to subtly investigate the out-of-place vehicle . Some habits never changed . <p> Junior Shafer , who owned and operated a nearby antique store , stooped to arrange his outside treasures . Actually , Paige rarely saw an antique on display , just junk and old Avon bottles . " Mornin ' , Mr. Shafer . Looks like another scorcher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customers away . " The balding man slowly stood and massaged his back . " Maybe I 'll advertise free air-conditioning and folks will stop in . " <p> " Whatever works . " She stole a quick glance at the Town Car and memorized the license plate number . No driver . " Looks like you have a visitor . " She pointed to the car . <p> Mr. Shafer narrowed his eyes and squinted . " Nah , that 's probably Eleanor 's son from Tulsa . He 's helping her paint the beauty shop . She said he had a new car . The boy must be doing fine in the insurance business . " <p> " Now that 's a good son . " <p> Mr. Shafer lifted his chin , then rubbed it . " Uh , you know , Paige ... he ai n't married . " <p> " And I 'm not looking . " She 'd never be in the market for a husband . Life had grown too complicated to consider such an undertaking , even if it did sound enticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tending to babies , not books . " <p> " Ah , but books do n't grow up or talk back . " <p> He shook his head and unlocked his store . <p> " I have a slice of peach pie for you . " Paige reached inside her tote bag and carefully brought out a plastic container . " I baked it around six this morning . It 's fresh . " <p> He turned back around . A slow grin spread from one generous ear to the other . " You 're right . You do n't need to go off and get married . I might not get my pies . " He did his familiar shoulder jig . " Thank you , sweet girl . " He reached for the pie with both hands as though it were the most precious thing he 'd ever been offered . <p> The door squeaked open at Shear Perfection . <p> " Mornin ' , Eleanor , " Mr. Shafer said . " I see your son 's car . Glad he 's helping you with the paintin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . " Miss Eleanor crossed the street , shielding her eyes from the steadily rising sun . " He is n't coming till the weekend . " <p> Paige 's nerve endings registered alert . " Wo n't that be wonderful for you ? " She took another passing glance at the vehicle . " I wonder who 's driving that fancy car ? Too early for courthouse business . " <p> " Somebody with money . " Mr. Shafer lifted the plastic lid off the freshly baked pie and inhaled deeply . " Ca n't wait till lunch . " <p> " Mercy , old man , you 're already rounder than my dear-departed mama 's potbelly stove . " Eleanor 's blue hair sparkled in the sunlight as though she 'd added glitter to her hairspray . <p> " You 're just jealous . If you were n't a diabetic , you 'd be stealing my pie . Paige here knows how to keep a man happy . " <p> One block down , a man carrying a camera emerged from between one of Mr. Shafer 's many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to snap a picture of the barbershop . Paige swung her attention back to her friends . He could be the real thing . She hoped so and forced down any precursors of fear . <p> " What 's he taking pictures of ? " Eleanor paused . " I 'm going to ask . " Determination etched her wrinkled face . She squared her shoulders and marched toward the stranger as though she represented the whole town . <p> Good , Eleanor . I 'll head back and let you do the recon work . <p> Eleanor and the stranger stood too far away for Paige to read their lips , but at least while the two talked , the man could n't take pictures . A few moments later , the stranger laughed much too loud . Eleanor reached out and shook his hand , then walked back . <p> Paige focused on Mr. Shafer . She picked up a watering can leaning precariously against a rotted-bottom chair . " Is this a new addition ? " <p> " Nah . It was inside . I just brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eye , she saw the stranger stare at them . Medium height . Narrow shoulders . Italian-cut clothes . Could n't see the type of camera . The stranger walked their way , shoulders arched and rigid . Unless he was a pro , she 'd have him sized up in thirty seconds , and then she 'd go about her day-relieved . <p> Mr. Shafer lifted his gaze toward Eleanor . " Who 's your friend ? " <p> " Jason Stevens , a photographer looking for some homespun pictures about small towns in Oklahoma . " <p> The way he 's dressed ? Paige 's heart pounded . She replaced the watering can . " Did he say for what magazine ? " <p> " Did n't ask . Why do n't you ? He wants to take a few shots of us standing in front of our businesses . " Eleanor beckoned to Stevens . " Come on over and meet my friends . Paige here wonders what magazine you work for . " <p> The man continued to smile-perfect teeth , perfect smile . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck out his hand . " Mornin ' , folks . I bet you 'd like your picture in the magazine insert . " His camera rested in the crook of his right hand , a new Nikon with fast lenses , perhaps a D90 or D200 . No dents or sign of use . Who was this guy ? He was n't any more a photographer than Eleanor or Mr. Shafer . <p> Have you used that piece of equipment before today ? <p> " Welcome to Split Creek , " Paige said . " I 'll pass on the picture , though . I 'm not photogenic , but you have a beautiful day to photograph our town . " She turned and started across the street to the library . <p> " Of course you 're photogenic , " Eleanor called . " No one wants to see a couple of old fuddy-duddies like us , but you 'd make front-page news . " <p> " You two are the center of attention . I 'm the dull librarian . " Paige continued to move rapidly across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " Sorry . I need to open the library . " <p> " Come on back , sweet girl . There 's no one waiting to get in , " Mr. Shafer said . <p> She lifted her hand and waved backward . Guilt nipped at her heels for leaving them with Stevens , but she had more at stake than they did . " See you two later . Nice meeting you , Mr. Stevens . " <p> She unlocked the old building that had once been a bank but now served as the town library . It oozed with character-beige and black marble floors , rich oaken walls , tall ceilings with intricately carved stone , and a huge crystal chandelier the size of a wagon wheel . The areas where tellers once met with customers now served as cozy reading nooks , and a huge , round , brass-trimmed vault-minus the door-held children 's books . The windows still even had a few iron bars . If only the town had high-speed Internet access . They 'd been promised that modernization for months . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sights and smells . Bless dear Andrew Carnegie for his vision to establish public libraries . Because of his philanthropy , Paige had a sanctuary . From the creaking sounds of antiquity to the timeworn smell of books and yellowed magazines , she had quiet companions that took her to the edge of experience but not the horror of reality . <p> In a small converted kitchen behind a vaulted door in the rear corner , Paige placed a peanut butter , bacon , and mayo sandwich in the fridge . Reaching down farther into her tote , she wrapped her fingers around a package of Reese 's Pieces . Those she 'd stash in her desk drawer . The rest of the peach pie sat on the backseat of her car . She 'd retrieve it once Stevens moved down the street , preferably out of town . <p> If he worked for Daniel Keary , her life was about to change-and not for the better . She shook off the chills racing up her arms . I can handle whatever it is . Snatching up her tote bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election nearly three months away , Stevens could be one of Keary 's men sent to make sure she still understood her boundaries . Regret took a stab at her heart , but there was nothing she could do about Keary 's popularity . She 'd tried and failed against a force too powerful for her at the time . But her prayers for truth continued . <p> Her sensible shoes clicked against the floor en route to the front window . Standing to the side , she peered out through the blinds to the sun-laden street for a glimpse of Stevens . He continued to take pictures . Mr. Shafer would most likely give him a tour of the town , beginning with his store and the history of every item strewn across it . The so-called photographer from the Oklahoman entered the antique shop . <p> That 'll bore him to tears and chase him out of town . <p> Paige went through the morning ritual of checking the drop box for returned books , of which there were six . She changed the dates on the date-due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . The seasoned citizens of Split Creek representing the local book club would arrive any minute , as regular as their morning 's constitutional . For an hour and a half they 'd discuss the merits of their current novel , everything from the characters to the plot . Today they could n't storm the shores of the library too soon for Paige . <p> As if on cue , Miss Alma bustled through the door-her purse slung loosely from her shoulder , her foil-wrapped banana nut bread in one hand and two books in the other . <p> " Good morning , Miss Alma , " Paige said . " Do you need some help ? " <p> " No thanks . If I loosen my hold on one thing , everything else will fall . " <p> A picture of PoliGrip hit Paige 's mind . " Well , you 're the first today . " <p> Miss Betty sashayed in , a true Southern belle dressed in her Sunday best , complete with a pillbox hat . " Miss Paige , may I brew a pot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am . It 's waiting for you . " Oh , how she loved these precious people . <p> Within moments the rest of Split Creek 's Senior Book Club arrived . Paige waved at Reverend Bateson , and as usual , Miss Eleanor and Mr. Shafer were bickering about something . <p> " At least we agree that Daniel Keary should be our next governor , " Miss Eleanor said . <p> At the mention of that name , Paige thought she 'd be physically ill . Keary was running on an Independent ticket , and she did n't care if a Democrat or a Republican pulled in the votes . Anyone but Keary . <p> " I have banana bread , " Miss Alma said . " But do n't be picking up a book with crumbs on your fingers . " <p> " We know , " several echoed . <p> Paige appreciated the comic relief . The rest of the members placed chairs in a circle beneath the massive chandelier while Paige checked in their books . <p> The library door opened again , and Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him erased the pleasantries she 'd been enjoying with the book club members . He made his way to the circulation desk and stood at the swinging door , trapping her inside . <p> Had n't she just swept the bugs off the steps of the library ? <p> " Since you wo n't let me take your picture outside , I thought I 'd snap a few in here . Wow- " his gaze took in the expanse of the building- " this was a bank . " His brilliant whites would have melted most women 's resolve . <p> Paige approached the swinging door . " No pictures , please . They always turn out looking really bad . " <p> " How about lunch ? " <p> " Are you coming on to me ? " Disgust curdled her insides . <p> He waved his free hand in front of his face . The man knew just when to utilize a dimple on his left cheek . " I 'm simply looking for a story to go along with my photos . This library is charming , fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dimple-faced city boy had now moved into the fast lane . " Miss Alma , I 'll help you arrange the chairs . " <p> " Nonsense . " Miss Alma shook her blue-gray head . " You help this young man . Those old people can do something besides stand around and complain about their gout and bursitis . " <p> Any other time , Paige would have laughed at the remark . But not today . <p> " Looks like they have everything under control . " The low , seductive tone of Stevens 's voice invited a slap in the face . <p> " I suggest you visit with a few other business owners for your newspaper 's needs , " she said . <p> " I 'm very disappointed . " <p> " You 'll get over it . " <p> " Ca n't we talk ? " He leaned over the swinging door . <p> " You can leave , or I can call the sheriff . Your choice . " She picked up the phone on her desk and met his gaze with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small-town girls . " He tossed her his best dejected look . Obviously he was n't accustomed to the word no . <p> Her reflexes remained catlike thanks to tai chi workouts still done at home behind drawn curtains . With minimal effort , she could dislocate a shoulder or crash the kneecap of an opponent twice her weight . Such skills were not a part of the job description for most small-town USA librarians , but then again most of them did n't have a working knowledge of Korean , Angolan Portuguese , Swahili , and Russian . The ability to decipher codes , a mastery of disguise , and a knack for using a paper clip to open locks ... not to mention a past that needed to stay buried . She had to resist the urge to toss Stevens out on his ear . Calm down . <p> " I 'm sorry we do n't have the book you wanted . I 'm sure one of the branches in Oklahoma City can help you . " <p> A silent challenge crested in his gray eyes , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door and turned , carrying his camera the way patrons carried books . " Know what ? This town would be a great place to hide out a CIA operative . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
