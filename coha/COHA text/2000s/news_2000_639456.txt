<p> ' When you come to a fork in the road , take it . ' <p> - Yogi Berra <p> With the Jan. 14 announcement of the impending resignation of Division of Wildlife director John Mumma , Colorado 's outdoor management indeed seems destined for a change of direction . Brace yourself for a hard turn to the right . <p> Five years into a sometimes tumultuous tenure , Mumma will leave the agency in April , leaving behind a checkered legacy of achievement and frustration . Yet among all the criticisms and critiques that tumbled upon Mumma in this most trying position , let this be said : Never was he devoid of passion for the resource and a determination to do the proper thing . <p> At age 60 , Mumma said all the expected things about timing . <p> Time , after a long career in federal and state resource management , to spend with his family . <p> Time to exercise his passions for hunting and fishing after too many hours in a superheated office . <p> Time to simply relax in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up in Farmington , N.M . <p> He recited the same priorities when he resigned , briefly , in January 1998 , then allowed himself to be persuaded to continue another two years . <p> But the principal point of timeliness Mumma did not mention is that , with an impending shift on the Colorado Wildlife Commission and an apparent power move by the administration of Gov . Bill Owens , his days were numbered . <p> Mumma never has been a favorite of the Republican legislative majority , and his fervent stand on certain wildlife matters put him at odds with a hierarchy intent on building its own team . <p> It may be premature to say Colorado wildlife management is in trouble , bit it 's safe to say it is in flux . During the 1999 legislative session , Republicans conspired to downgrade the Division of Wildlife to a Class II agency under control of Greg Walcher , Owens ' appointee as executive director of natural resources . <p> Further , Walcher and state agriculture commissioner Don Ament were given ex-officio status on the Wildlife Commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb - on proceedings . <p> Owens now has three loyal appointees on the eight-member commission and a golden opportunity to gain a majority when two more positions come open in March . The growing concern among many observers is whether the administration craves sound wildlife management with a measure of independent thought or absolute control . <p> A telling litmus may be whether Owens reappoints current commission chairman Chuck Lewis to another term . Lewis , highly effective during his four years , is a staunch Republican , a rancher , a fisherman , a conservationist and a man who knows his own mind . That decision will say much about the Owens agenda . <p> So , too , will the selection of Mumma 's successor . Will it be through a completely open process for the most qualified manager or a manipulation to seat a puppet who will follow the party line ? <p> Mumma 's best achievements were in guiding DOW through a thorny restructuring dictated by a cantankerous legislature , guiding an ongoing wetlands program , orchestrating the difficult hatchery modernization and cleanup to combat whirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest fear is that the land programs will be derailed , ' Mumma said , addressing what promises to be the most divisive issue in the new order . <p> Already , the Owens administration appears adamantly against the purchase of additional state wildlife lands , even as runaway population growth strains public use to the breaking point . These philosophies extend to public lands as well . <p> Walcher opposes a federal initiative to limit motorized access and provide assorted resource protection on the White River National Forest , even to the point of squelching supportive biologic data from state employees . <p> In a heartfelt , four-page resignation letter to Owens , Mumma detailed a number of challenges the administration , the legislature , the commission and his successor must meet . <p> A license fee increase to alleviate a DOW budget shortfall that threatens vital programs . This may entail some amendment of the TABOR tax restrictions , tax indexing or other adjustments . Walcher has indicated firm support for license hikes and other fiscal relief . <p> To continue purchase of appropriate wildlife habitat to meet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers dedicated to the conservation ethic and long-term interest of the resource and its users . <p> ' These appointments by you and succeeding governors carry a huge amount of public trust responsibility and must be taken very seriously , ' Mumma wrote . ' I trust that you will be most diligent in making future selections that reflect first and foremost a dedication to the wildlife resource . ' <p> With power comes potential for tremendous good or ill . Not in a quarter century has any administration carried such opportunity and responsibility . <p> The Owens-Walcher team can use its influence for soaring achievement in a troubled time of unbridled growth and financial strain . <p> Or it can take the low road toward private interest and selfish economic gain . <p> OUTPOSTS <p> All Marvin Woolf ever wanted was a nice place to change his waders . <p> ' I 've been fishing Colorado more than 50 years and I find it tougher to get my equipment off and on . I look around for someplace to sit down and it 's just not there , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be unprecedented in local wildlife circles . <p> Assuming many others have similar wishes , Woolf made a $ 15,000 gift to launch what has been termed the ' Adopt a Bench ' program . The notion is to place benches at key roadside locations on popular public streams . <p> The Colorado Division of Wildlife chipped in with another $ 5,000 as seed money . Woolf asked to make the gift anonymously , but DOW persuaded him to go public as an encouragement for others to participate with donations . <p> ' People could do this in memory of a relative or friend , ' Woolf said . ' The benches would make a nice place to have lunch , and they could include a boot jack as well .
