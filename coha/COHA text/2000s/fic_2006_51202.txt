ONE DAY BILLY SAW A UNICORN . He could tell what it was by the big horn growing out of its head . It was standing at the edge of the woods . <p> " Want a unicorn ? " the unicorn asked . It was white . <p> Billy shook his head . " Girls like unicorns , " he said . " I 'm a boy . " <p> " Boys would like unicorns too , " said the unicorn , " if they knew what unicorns were really like . " <p> Billy thought about that . " What are they really like ? " he asked . <p> " Take me home and you 'll see , " said the unicorn . <p> " You 're too big , " said Billy . <p> " Yes , but unicorns do n't eat anything , " said the unicorn . " Plus , we 're invisible . " <p> Billy took the unicorn home . It was hard to get it in the door . His mother could n't see it , though . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner . Its horn glowed in the dark . <p> " Turn out that light , " said Billy 's mother . " Go to sleep . " <p> Cool ! thought Billy . She could see the light but not the unicorn . <p> Billy hung a T-shirt over the unicorn 's horn . It looked like a little ghost in the dark . <p> " Hey , " said Billy . <p> The unicorn was going to the bathroom . <p> " You ca n't go to the bathroom in my room , " said Billy . <p> " Too late , " said the unicorn . A big blue jewel dropped down between its legs . <p> It was as big as a Brussels sprout . It had lots of square sides . <p> " Pick it up , " said the unicorn . <p> " No way , " said Billy . <p> After a while , the blue jewel disappeared . <p> " Get a load of this , " said Billy 's father . He was reading the paper . " Unicorn Escapes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Billy 's mother . <p> " It went to the bathroom in my room , " said Billy . <p> " Shut up , " said Billy 's father . " Go to your room . Both of you . " <p> When Billy got back to his room , the unicorn was going to the bathroom again . <p> " Hey , " said Billy . <p> " Go ahead , pick it up , " said the unicorn . " It does n't stink . " <p> Billy picked it up . It was warm , but it did n't stink . <p> " It 's like money , " said the unicorn . " You can buy magazines with it . " <p> Billy liked magazines . He went to the store and picked one out . <p> " Dale Earnhardt , " said the store owner . " That 's a special memorial issue . Got any money ? " <p> Billy shook his head . <p> " Then you 're out of luck , " said the store owner . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like money , " said Billy . He showed the store owner the blue jewel . It was still warm . <p> The store owner sniffed it . " You get two for that , " he said . He gave Billy another magazine . It was all about girls . <p> " I do n't like girls , " said Billy . <p> " Give it to your unicorn , " said the store owner . <p> " Did you really escape from the zoo ? " Billy asked . <p> " No , " said the unicorn . It was looking at the girls . Billy had to turn the pages . The unicorn had no hands . <p> " The paper says you did . " <p> " I planted that story , " said the unicorn . " There is no zoo . " <p> Billy thought about that . <p> " Turn the page , " said the unicorn . <p> " I thought you did n't like girls , " said Billy . <p> " These are n't wearing any clothes , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . " <p> " Can I ride on your back ? " Billy asked . <p> " After you go to bed , " said the unicorn . <p> That night Billy rode the unicorn around the yard . Its horn was like a headlight . It left little tracks in the sandbox . <p> " How come my mother ca n't see you ? " Billy asked . <p> " She never tried , " said the unicorn . " Plus , unicorns are invisible . " <p> " How come I can see you , then ? " <p> " We 're not that invisible , " said the unicorn . <p> Billy thought about that . " Can I take you to school ? " he asked . <p> " Unicorns do n't like school , " said the unicorn . <p> Billy was watching TV when the phone rang . <p> It was the store owner . " I want my magazines back , " he said . " That jewel disappeared . " <p> " It 's like money , " said Billy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner . " Bring back my magazines or I will call the FBI . " <p> " I 'm not afraid of the FBI , " said Billy . <p> But he was . His hands were trembling as he hung up the phone . <p> " Who was that ? " asked Billy 's mother . <p> " Nobody , " said Billy . <p> " Where 's my Dale Earnhardt magazine ? " asked Billy . He could n't find it anywhere . <p> " I found out he 's dead , " said the unicorn . " So I tore it up with my horn . " <p> " Oh no , " said Billy . " He was one of the Greats . " <p> " Dead people do n't belong in magazines , " said the unicorn . <p> " The store owner wants his magazines back , " said Billy . He tried to get the girl magazine back but the unicorn was standing on it . It had sharp feet like a deer . <p> " You 're going to get us both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FBI . " <p> " Just turn the page , " said the unicorn . " Let me worry about him . " <p> " Get a load of this , " said Billy 's father . He was reading the paper . " Store Owner Killed by Unicorn . " <p> " I thought they were make-believe , " said Billy 's mother . <p> " It 's invisible , " said Billy . " It has a sharp horn . " <p> " Shut up , both of you , " said Billy 's father . <p> " That was cool , " said Billy . " But I think you should hide somewhere else . " He was getting tired of the unicorn . <p> " I like here , " said the unicorn . " But I need another magazine . I 'm finished with this one . " <p> Billy had an idea . " You would like it at school , " he said . " There are lots of girls there . " <p> " Do they wear clothes ? " asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . " <p> " Girls like unicorns , " said Billy . " They will let you look up their dresses . " <p> The next day , Billy took the unicorn to school . The teacher could n't see it . The boys could n't either . <p> The girls could , though . " Billy has a unicorn , " they said , clapping their hands together . " Can we ride on it ? " <p> " You can have it , " said Billy . He was tired of the unicorn . " Jewels come out of its butt . " <p> " That 's cool , " said the girls . " It can sleep in the girls ' bathroom . " <p> " It does n't sleep , " said Billy . <p> " Get on , " said the unicorn . It took all the girls for a ride . It looked up their dresses as they got on and off . <p> " What 's going on ? " asked the boys . <p> Billy told them about the unicorn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the part about the store owner . <p> " Invisible stuff is make-believe , " said the boys . " Plus , unicorns are strictly for girls .

" <p> They made fun of Billy . <p> This was their big mistake . <p> " Home from school already ? " asked Billy 's mother . <p> " They let us out early , " said Billy . <p> " Get a load of this , " said Billy 's father . He was reading the paper at the supper table . " Unicorn Kills School Boys . " <p> " That must be why they let Billy out early , " said Billy 's mother . " It was a tragedy .
