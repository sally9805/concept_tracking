<p> In a quest that began when he was an undrafted free agent in 1997 , Jerome Davis continues to strive for a full-time NFL job at 28 . <p> The rugged defensive end has persevered through cuts by four NFL teams , two homesickness-inducing journeys to NFL Europe and one failed attempt to latch on in Canada . Not to mention a left leg broken in two places that was supposed to end his hopes five years ago . <p> The 6-5 , 300-pound man presses on , now as a member of the San Francisco 49ers ' practice squad . " You try not to make it that you are not good enough , " Davis says of the odyssey that comprises his career . " It 's that you do n't fit that particular puzzle . " <p> He embodies the spirit of many players on all-guts , no-glory practice squads . They drill with their respective teams , awaiting an opportunity that might come through illness , injury or coaching change . If it comes at all . <p> Given the NFL 's head-banging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " taxi " squads is essential . These players are available to all 32 teams when a need arises . Players credited with one full NFL season are no longer eligible for practice squads . <p> The term began in the 1940s , when then-Cleveland Browns owner Arthur " Mickey " McBride ran a cab company . If the Browns cut a player , McBride offered him a taxi driver job to keep him nearby in case of a roster emergency . <p> Davis understands the concept . " The bottom line is the NFL is a business , " he says . " You have to respect that aspect of the game and keep going on . " <p> Scott Brown , Davis ' defensive line coach at the University of Minnesota , says his former recruit always possessed intriguing potential . <p> " There 's talent there that 's good enough to make you believe he can be something special , " Brown says . " For whatever reason , it has n't peaked . " <p> Beating the odds . . . again <p> For every Michael Strahan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a Jerome Davis earning a fraction of Strahan 's fortune or even the league minimum of $ 225,000 a year for making the team . <p> Actually , there is a long line of Jerome Davises , helping the rich and famous prepare for game day by mimicking upcoming opponents and straining to catch the eye of a coach . <p> As many times as the game has decked Davis , he keeps climbing to his feet . He is willing to chase his dream  --  for the practice squad standard of $ 4,000 a week  --  if someone will keep issuing him a helmet and pads . <p> " It 's just another chance to see how badly you really want it , " he says . <p> After a solid career at the University of Minnesota that included a career-high 50 tackles as a senior , the Detroit native signed with the hometown Lions and did well enough in camp to land on the practice squad in 1997 . <p> Detroit then allocated him to Frankfurt in NFL Europe , where he won a World Bowl ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was having a strong camp for the Lions that year when he dove into a pile trying to stop a running play against Atlanta in the last minute of the last preseason game . He did not get up . <p> " I was optimistic that maybe the wind was knocked out of him or something like that , " says J.D. Davis , Jerome 's father , who watched from the stands . " But then you go through that long period where they 're working on him and then they beckon to the sidelines for the cart . You know it 's not good . " <p> He rushed to be with his son , whose pain from his broken left leg was exceeded only by his mental anguish . " He was more agonized that he worked hard to make the team and he was n't going to be able to play , " the father says . <p> Doctors comforted Davis with medication . Their words added to his misery . <p> " They told me I would n't be able to play the game again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk without a limp . " <p> For a long time , he did walk with a limp . Yet , with the encouragement of his father , he fought through a 10-month rehabilitation program  --  swimming and martial arts exercises  --  to make his way back . <p> " There have been numerous people who became successful in life who , by all accounts , were n't supposed to do it , " Davis ' father says . " But I firmly believe you have to persevere . " <p> His life exemplifies that . J.D. Davis dropped out of his segregated Mississippi high school in the 11th grade . He joined the Army for " three years , seven months and 19 days , " fought in Vietnam , returned home to earn his college degree and now owns and operates an insurance agency in Troy , Mich . <p> He fueled his son 's desire to make what doctors said was an impossible comeback . " I would tell him , ' You better give this all you 've got now while you can . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will have no second thoughts . " <p> Trying to catch a break <p> Davis moved on to the Carolina Panthers , the CFL 's Calgary Stampeders , the Denver Broncos , the 49ers , the Frankfurt Galaxy ( again ) and back to the 49ers . In many cases , he was a late cut , the unkindest cut of all . <p> " You get a call to go they appreciate your work and your work ethic , and you press on , " Davis says . <p> In the latest instance , San Francisco kept Davis for its regular-season opener , on the road against the New York Giants . He got in a couple of times on the field-goal block team without having an impact . Injuries at other positions led the 49ers to put him on the taxi squad . <p> " He was impressive enough in preseason games that we felt his energy and commitment and work ethic were well worth having around , " 49ers general manager Terry Donahue says . " He has persevered so long and has hung in there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Brown , now Duke 's defensive line coach , relates a sequence of events that might epitomize why Davis is so close , yet so far , from achieving NFL success . <p> After Brown benched Davis when he started slowly in a game during his redshirt sophomore season at Minnesota , the defensive coordinator approached at a critical point in the contest . <p> " Do we have our best pass-rushers in the game ? " the coordinator asked . <p> Brown , aware that Davis stood eagerly at his side , replied , " Yes , we do . " <p> " He never said a word , " Brown says , " but I could see it just crushed him . " <p> Brown inserted Davis for the next play . What happened was a revelation . <p> " He literally ran over the offensive tackle , " Brown says . " It was as physical a play as I 'd ever seen him make . " <p> Davis ' father insists his son has fallen short for reasons other than ability and effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " It 's about being in the right place at the right time . He has never been in the right place at the right time . " <p> Another round to go <p> The ticking of the clock grows louder . <p> Davis , who is single , majored in economics at Minnesota and plans to use the offseason to earn his degree there . He is a licensed insurance agent who worked for his father between pro football opportunities . He plans to eventually take over his father 's insurance business and expand those services by offering financial planning . <p> Donahue says the 49ers are open to giving Davis one more look next year . " Probably next year will be his last real opportunity to make a team . He 's getting to that point and age where people will say they admire him but they will have to look at a younger player . " <p> Donahue refers to Davis as if he is a battered heavyweight . " I think he has one more round in him , " Donahue says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging in pursuit of his first official NFL tackle , something to prove he played the game . <p> " Anybody can give up , " he says .
