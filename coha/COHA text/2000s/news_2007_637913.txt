<p> Pfc . Aaron Kincaid , 25 , had been joking with buddies just before their Humvee rolled over the bomb . His wife , Rachel , later learned that the blast blew Kincaid , a father of two from outside Atlanta , through the Humvee 's metal roof . <p> Army investigators who reviewed the Sept. 23 attack near Riyadh , Iraq , wrote in their report that only providence could have saved Kincaid from dying that day : " There was no way short of not going on that route at that time ( that ) this tragedy could have been diverted . " <p> A USA TODAY investigation of the Pentagon 's efforts to protect troops in Iraq suggests otherwise . <p> Years before the war began , Pentagon officials knew of the effectiveness of another type of vehicle that better shielded troops from bombs like those that have killed Kincaid and 1,500 other soldiers and Marines . But military officials repeatedly balked at appeals  --  from commanders on the battlefield and from the Pentagon 's own staff  --  to provide the lifesaving Mine Resistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat missions , USA TODAY found . <p> In a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates late last month , two U.S. senators said the delays cost the lives of an estimated " 621 to 742 Americans " who would have survived explosions had they been in MRAPs rather than Humvees . <p> The letter , from Sens . Joseph Biden , D-Del. , and Kit Bond , R-Mo. , assumed the initial calls for MRAPs came in February 2005 , when Marines in Iraq asked the Pentagon for almost 1,200 of the vehicles . USA TODAY found that the first appeals for the MRAP came much earlier . <p> As early as December 2003 , when the Marines requested their first 27 MRAPs for explosives-disposal teams , Pentagon analysts sent detailed information about the superiority of the vehicles to the Joint Chiefs of Staff , e-mails obtained by USA TODAY show . Later pleas came from Iraq , where commanders saw that the approach the Joint Chiefs embraced  --  adding armor to the sides of Humvees , the standard vehicles in the war zone  --  did little to protect against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general who chaired the Joint Chiefs until Oct. 1 , 2005 , says buying MRAPs " was not on the radar screen when I was chairman . " Air Force general Richard Myers , now retired , says top military officials dealt with a number of vehicle issues , including armoring Humvees . The MRAP , however , was " not one of them . " Something related to MRAPs " might have crossed my desk , " Myers says , " but I do n't recall it . " <p> Why the issue never received more of a hearing from top officials early in the war remains a mystery , given the chorus of concern . One Pentagon analyst complained in an April 29 , 2004 , e-mail to colleagues , for instance , that it was " frustrating to see the pictures of burning Humvees while knowing that there are other vehicles out there that would provide more protection . " <p> The analyst was referring to the MRAP , whose V-shaped hull puts the crew more than 3 feet off the ground and deflects explosions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower-riding Humvees . Pentagon officials , civilians and military alike , had been searching for technologies to guard against improvised explosive devices , or IEDs . The makeshift bombs are the No. 1 killer of U.S. forces . <p> The MRAP was not new to the Pentagon . The technology had been developed in South Africa and Rhodesia in the 1970s , making it older than Kincaid and most of the other troops killed by homemade bombs . The Pentagon had tested MRAPs in 2000 , purchased fewer than two dozen and sent some to Iraq . They were used primarily to protect explosive ordnance disposal teams , not to transport troops or to chase Iraqi insurgents . <p> The goal : Iraqis ' stand up ' so U.S. can ' stand down ' <p> Even as the Pentagon balked at buying MRAPs for U.S. troops , USA TODAY found that the military pushed to buy them for a different fighting force : the Iraqi army . <p> On Dec. 22 , 2004  --  two weeks after President Bush told families of servicemembers that " we 're doing everything we possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army general solicited ideas for an armored vehicle for the Iraqis . The Army had an " extreme interest " in getting troops better armor , then-brigadier general Roger Nadeau told a subordinate looking at foreign technology , in an e-mail obtained by USA TODAY . <p> In a follow-up message , Nadeau clarified his request : " What I failed to point out in my first message to you folks is that the US Govt is interested not for US use , but for possible use in fielding assets to the Iraqi military forces . " <p> In response , Lt. Col. Clay Brown , based in Australia , sent information on two types of MRAPs manufactured overseas . " By all accounts , these are some of the best in the world , " he wrote . " If I were fitting out the Iraqi Army , this is where I 'd look ( wish we had some ! ) " <p> The first contract for what would become the Iraqi Light Armored Vehicle  --  virtually identical to the MRAPs sought by U.S. forces then and now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued in May 2006 . The vehicles , called Badgers , began arriving in Iraq 90 days later , according to BAE . In September 2006 , the Pentagon said it would provide up to 600 more to Iraqi forces . As of this spring , 400 had been delivered . <p> The rush to equip the Iraqis stood in stark contrast to the Pentagon 's efforts to protect U.S. troops . <p> In February 2005 , two months after Nadeau solicited ideas for better armor for the Iraqis and was told MRAPs were an answer , an urgent-need request for the same type of vehicle came from embattled Marines in Anbar province . The request , signed by then-brigadier general Dennis Hejlik , said the Marines " can not continue to lose ... serious and grave casualties to IEDs ... at current rates when a commercial off-the-shelf capability exists to mitigate " them . <p> Officials at Marine headquarters in Quantico , Va. , shelved the request for 1,169 vehicles . Fifteen months passed before a second request reached the Joint Chiefs and was approved . Those vehicles finally began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original request . Because of the delay , the Marines are investigating how its urgent-need requests are handled . <p> The long delay infuriates some members of Congress . " Every day , our troops are being maimed or killed needlessly because we have n't fielded this soon enough , " says Rep. Gene Taylor , D-Miss . " The costs are in human lives , in kids who will never have their legs again , people blind , crippled . That 's the real tragedy . " <p> Not until two months ago did the Pentagon champion the MRAP for all U.S. forces . Gates made MRAPs the military 's top priority . The plan is to build the vehicles as fast as possible until conditions warrant a change , according to a military official who has direct knowledge of the program but is not authorized to speak on the record . Thousands are in the pipeline at a cost so far of about $2.4 billion . <p> Gates said he was influenced by a news report  --  originally in USA TODAY  --  that disclosed Marine units using MRAPs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past year . His tone was grave . " For every month we delay , " he said , " scores of young Americans are going to die . " <p> One reason officials put off buying MRAPs in significant quantities : They never expected the war to last this long . Bush set the tone on May 1 , 2003 , six weeks after the U.S. invasion , when he declared on board the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln that " major combat operations in Iraq have ended . " <p> Gen. George Casey , the top commander in Iraq from June 2004 until February this year , repeatedly said that troop levels in Iraq would be cut just as soon as Iraqi troops took more responsibility for security . In March 2005 , he predicted " very substantial reductions " in U.S. troops by early 2006 . He said virtually the same thing a year later . <p> Casey was n't the only optimist . In May 2005 , Vice President Cheney declared that the insurgency was " in its last throes . " <p> Given the view that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for expensive new vehicles such as the MRAP , at least not in large quantities . The MRAPs ordered for the Iraqis were intended to speed the day when , to use Bush 's words , Iraqi forces could " stand up " and the United States could " stand down . " <p> Nadeau , who wrote the e-mail that led to MRAPs for the Iraqis , explains why he did so : " The U.S. government knows that eventually we 're going to get out " of Iraq . The United States wants " to help get ( the Iraqis ) in a position to take care of themselves . " <p> For U.S. forces , however , the answer was something else : adding armor to Humvees . Nadeau and others say the choice made sense because Humvees were already in Iraq and the improvements  --  adding steel to the sides , upgrading the windows and replacing the canvas doors  --  could be made quickly , and far more cheaply . Adding armor to a Humvee cost only $14,000 ; a Humvee armored at the factory cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 million , though some foreign models cost only about $200,000 in 2004 . <p> The solution to the IED problem in 2003 had to be " immediate , " says retired vice admiral Gordon Holder , director for logistics for the Joint Chiefs until mid-2004 . " We had to stop the bleeding . " Holder says MRAPs seemed impractical for the immediate need : " We should n't take four years to field something the kids needed yesterday . " <p> Would it actually have taken four years ? That depends upon how much urgency the Pentagon and Congress attached to speeding production . Force Protection Inc. , the small South Carolina company that landed the first significant MRAP contracts , was criticized this month by the Pentagon 's inspector general for failing to deliver its vehicles on time . But bigger defense contractors were available then  --  and have secured MRAP contracts in recent weeks that call for deliveries in as little as four months . <p> A bigger obstacle might have been philosophical : The MRAP did n't fit the Pentagon 's long-term vision of how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded the Iraq war " as a means to change " the military , " make it lighter , make it more responsive , make it more agile , " Holder says . The MRAP , heavier and slower than the Humvee , would n't have measured up , he says . <p> The commander ' IEDs are my No. 1 threat ' <p> By June 2004 , the military had lost almost 200 U.S. troops to the homemade bombs . Gen. John Abizaid , then head of U.S. Central Command , told the Joint Chiefs that " IEDs are my No. 1 threat . " He called for a " mini-Manhattan Project " against IEDs , akin to the task force that developed the atomic bomb during World War II . <p> The Pentagon organized a small task force that , two years later , morphed into a full-fledged agency : the Joint IED Defeat Organization , or JIEDDO . Its leader , Montgomery Meigs , is a retired four-star general . Its annual budget totals $4.3 billion . Its mission : to stop IEDs from killing U.S. troops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its priorities clear . First , prevent IEDs from being planted by attacking the insurgency . Then , if a device is planted , prevent it from exploding . " When all Else Fails , " reads another slide , " Survive the blast . " That put solutions such as the MRAP into the category of last resorts . <p> JIEDDO did spend its own money for 122 MRAPs , but it primarily focused on electronic jammers to prevent bombs from being remotely detonated , unmanned surveillance aircraft to catch insurgents putting bombs along roads and better intelligence on who was building and planting bombs . <p> The agency has claimed some successes . Insurgents in 2007 had to plant six times as many bombs as they did in 2004 to inflict the same number of U.S. casualties , Meigs said in an interview . <p> But the insurgents  --  Sunnis loyal to the deposed leader Saddam Hussein , Shiites who hated the U.S. occupiers and foreigners aligned with al-Qaeda  --  often managed to stay one step ahead of JIEDDO . They changed the kind of explosives they planted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detonated them . <p> When the Pentagon added armor to the sides of Humvees to guard against bombs planted along roadsides , the insurgents responded by burying bombs in the roads . The bombs could blast through the vulnerable underbelly of the Humvees . The insurgents also moved to larger , more sophisticated bombs , some packed with as much as 100 pounds of explosives . <p> Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England , the No. 2 official at the Pentagon , testified on Capitol Hill in June that " as the threat has evolved , we have evolved . We work very , very hard to be responsible to our troops . " <p> Taylor , the Democratic congressman from Mississippi , pressed England about why the Pentagon waited until May to request substantial numbers of MRAPs . " Are you telling me no one could see that ( need ) coming , no one could recognize that the bottom of the Humvee " did n't protect troops , and " that 's why the kids inside are losing their legs and their lives ? " Taylor asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " People have not died needlessly , and we have not left our people without equipment . " <p> To Pentagon decision-makers , the Humvee seemed able to handle the threat early in the war  --  roadside bombs , rather than those buried in the roads . " If anybody could have guessed in 2003 that we would be looking at these kind of ( high-powered , buried ) IEDs that we 're seeing now in 2007 , then we would have been looking at something much longer " term as a solution , Holder says . " But who had the crystal ball back then ? " <p> Nadeau , now a major general in charge of the Army 's Test and Evaluation Command in Alexandria , Va. , also defends the Pentagon 's choices . He says buried IEDs did not become a serious threat to the armored Humvees until 2006 . Critics might say , " ' Why did n't you guys buy 16,000 MRAPs a decade ago ? ' " Nadeau says today . " You know , I did n't need them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Humvees surfaced sooner . Lt. Col. Dallas Eubanks , chief of operations for the Army 's 4th Infantry Division in 2003-04 , says IEDs became more menacing before he left Iraq . " We were certainly seeing underground IEDs by early 2004 , " he says . <p> In mid-2005 , two top Marines  --  Gen. William Nyland , assistant Marine commandant , and Maj. Gen. William Catto , head of Marine Corps Systems Command  --  testified before Congress that they were seeing an " evolving " threat from underbelly blasts . They said at the time that armored Humvees remained their best defense . <p> The congressman MRAP 's ' simple ' advantage <p> Just after lunch on June 27 , 2004 , a group of enlisted men parked a handful of armored vehicles near a cinderblock building at Marine headquarters in Fallujah , Iraq . <p> The day had turned sweltering , like every summer afternoon in central Iraq . But this day was special . A congressional delegation had arrived , and among the dignitaries was Rep. Duncan Hunter , then the chairman of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressman . He was a Vietnam War veteran , and his son , then a 27-year-old Marine lieutenant also named Duncan , was stationed at the base . <p> More important to most of the Marines , the California Republican had been instrumental in pushing the Pentagon to get better armor for them . Humvees with cloth doors  --  canvas , like the crusher hat that Hunter wore that day  --  had been standard issue when the war began . The fabric worked well to shield the sun ; it offered no protection against explosives . <p> Then , as now , Hunter was impatient with the pace of procurement in Iraq . That winter , he had dispatched his staff to steel mills , where they persuaded managers and union leaders to set aside commercial orders to expedite steel needed to armor the Humvees . He also worked with the Army and its contractors to expand production . <p> In Fallujah , Hunter recognized the Humvees . He could n't identify the two vehicles next to them . One was called a Cougar , the other a Buffalo . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both , he was told , were coveted . They were used by explosives disposal teams , but combat units " looked at them and said , ' We want those , ' " Hunter recalls . <p> Throughout most of Iraq , they still have n't arrived . <p> Despite requests from the field , Pentagon officials decided to ration the vehicle . In 2003 and 2004 , they bought about 55 , and only for explosives-disposal units . But they chose a different approach for protecting the rest of the troops : adding armor to Humvees . The choice was problematic . The Humvee 's flat bottom channels an explosion through the center of the vehicle , toward the occupants . <p> Memos and e-mails obtained by USA TODAY show a stream of concerns about the decision to armor the Humvee . Most went up the chain of command and withered : <p> *December 2003 : At the direction of then-deputy Defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz , who was troubled by the mounting death toll from IEDs , the Joint Chiefs began to explore options for giving troops better armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the African country of Namibia , was passed from analysts in the Pentagon to Lt. Col. Steven Ware , an aide collecting information for the Joint Chiefs . <p> *March 30 , 2004 : Gen. Larry Ellis , in charge of U.S. Forces Command in Atlanta , sent a memo to the Army 's chief of staff , Gen. Peter Schoomaker . He complained that " some Army members and agencies are still in a peacetime posture . " U.S. commanders in Iraq told him that the armored Humvee " is not providing the solution the Army hoped to achieve . " He did n't recommend MRAPs but rather suggested accelerating production of a combat vehicle called the Stryker . In response , the military said new Humvee armor kits would suffice . <p> *April 28-29 , 2004 : Duncan Lang , a Pentagon analyst who worked in acquisition and technology , suggested purchasing the Wer'Wolf , the MRAP put before the Joint Chiefs in December 2003 . In an e-mail to colleagues and supervisors , Lang said " a number could be sent to Iraq " as quickly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He called it " frustrating to see the pictures of burning Humvees while knowing that there are other vehicles out there that would provide more protection . " <p> *April 30 , 2004 : Another Pentagon analyst , Air Force Lt. Col. Bob Harris , forwarded details about MRAP options to a member of the IED task force . The list included a variety of MRAPs , among them the Wer'Wolf and Force Protection 's Cougar . " There was no great clarity as to why they did n't pursue these options , " Harris says . " I saw it as my job to educate . " Harris is now an acquisition officer at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts . <p> Hunter says the advantages the MRAP had on the Humvee were clear . " It 's a simple formula , " Hunter says . " A vehicle that 's 1 foot off the ground gets 16 times that ( blast ) impact that you get in a vehicle that 's 4 feet off the ground , " like the MRAP . <p> Although Hunter favored adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion to that approach a costly mistake . " It 's true that they saved more lives by moving first on up-armoring the Humvees , " he says . " The flaw is that they did nothing on MRAPs . The up-armoring of Humvees did n't have to be an exclusive operation . " <p> Holder dismisses the idea that the Pentagon could have moved on a dual track : armoring Humvees while ordering up MRAPs . He doubts Congress would have funded both at the time . But that 's exactly what Congress is doing now  --  buying both vehicles . <p> " We probably should 've had the foresight " to start buying MRAPs earlier , says Ware , the Joint Chiefs aide ( now retired ) who passed the information to superiors and counterparts in the Army and Marines . But " we just could n't get them there fast enough . " Adding armor to the Humvee , Ware says , " was better than nothing . " <p> The lieutenant colonel ' Hope no one gets wasted ' <p> A PowerPoint presentation , dated Aug. 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most are bandaged . One is bloody . His left eye is barely open , his injured right is covered by a patch . Each was maimed by an IED . Each , save one , was in a Humvee . <p> On another slide : " Numerous vehicles on the market provide far superior ballistic protection " than the Humvee , wrote then-lieutenant colonel Jim Hampton , the man who prepared the presentation for the operations staff of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Baghdad . <p> Safety is a passion for Hampton . He 's so concerned with security that he asks his wife , Kate , to take her pistol when she goes for walks on their 80 acres in rural Mississippi . When he got to Iraq in early 2004 , he was tasked with looking at armor options to protect the Corps of Engineers , the agency sent to help with rebuilding efforts . For weeks , he studied armor options . His conclusion : The corps should get MRAPs to protect its people , specifically Wer'Wolves . Hampton says he asked for 53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have been more opposed to up-armoring the Humvees and warned his superiors . He even e-mailed his wife from Iraq . " Hey Babe , " his e-mail read . " Just a little aggravated with the bureaucracy . It is simply beyond my comprehension why we 're having to go through such ( an ordeal ) to order confounded hard vehicles . I sure hope no one gets wasted before the powers-that-be get off their collective fat asses . " <p> Finally , he wrote his congressman , Rep. Chip Pickering , R-Miss. , urging him to investigate deaths involving the Humvee . " We would never consider sending troops " in Humvees " up against armor or artillery , " Hampton wrote , " but this is tantamount to what we 're doing because these vehicles are being engaged with the very ordnance delivered by artillery in the form of improvised explosive devices . " <p> By November 2004 , Pentagon analyst Lang had grown discouraged , an e-mail shows . " I have found that you can never put the word out too many times , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to ( the Secretary of Defense 's office ) , Army and ( Marine Corps ) contacts I have . Some of it is getting to the rapid fielding folks and force protection folks that are looking at Iraq issues . I do not see much action . " <p> Lang closed the message with a variation on his earlier plea : " For the life of me , I can not figure out why we have not taken better advantage of the sources of such vehicles , " he wrote . " We should be buying 200 , not 2 , at a time . These things work , they save lives and they do n't cost much , if any , more than what we are using now . " At the time , a basic Wer'Wolf cost about the same as a factory-made armored Humvee : around $200,000 . <p> In December 2004 , at a town hall meeting with troops in Kuwait , a soldier asked Rumsfeld about the lack of armor on military vehicles . Rumsfeld explained the situation this way : " You go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the Army you might want or wish to have at a later time . " <p> The concerns troops voiced at the meeting might have had an impact . Within a week , the Marine Corps Systems Command in Quantico posted its first notice seeking information on MRAPs from potential contractors . <p> Back in Fallujah , the desire for the Cougar had grown . By February 2005 , the Marines were formally asking for more . Field commanders sent their first large-scale request for MRAPs , seeking 1,169 vehicles with specifications that closely mirrored those of the Cougar . They no longer envisioned the vehicle as limited to explosives-disposal teams ; they wanted MRAPs for combat troops , too . <p> Roy McGriff III , then a major , drafted the request signed by Brig . Gen. Hejlik . " MRAP vehicles will protect Marines , reduce casualties , increase mobility and enhance mission success , " the request read . " Without MRAP , personnel loss rates are likely to continue at their current rate . " In spring 2005 , he would have a chance to argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Unnecessary ' casualties <p> They convened March 29-30 , 2005 , at the Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar , Calif . The occasion : a safety board meeting , a regular gathering to address safety issues across the Corps . In attendance : five three-star generals , four two-stars , seven one-stars and McGriff . <p> McGriff knew the MRAP 's history and the Pentagon 's reluctance to invest in the vehicle . He had learned about the vehicle from a fellow Marine , Wayne Sinclair . Sinclair , then a captain , wrote in the July 1996 issue of the Marine Corps Gazette that " an affordable answer to the land mine was developed over 20 years ago . It 's time that Marines at the sharp end shared in . . . this discovery . " <p> Addressing the generals , McGriff recommended analyzing every incident involving Marine vehicles the same way investigators probe aircraft crashes . Look at the vehicle for flaws , McGriff recalls telling the officers , and examine the tactics used to defeat it . <p> Lt. Gen. Wallace Gregson , commander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Mattis , leader of the Marine Combat Development Command , listened and then conferred for a moment . <p> The room grew quiet . " Then they said , ' OK , what do you want to do ? ' " McGriff remembers . <p> He recited the very plan that the Pentagon , under a new Defense secretary , would embrace in 2007 : " A phased transition . Continue to armor Humvees . At the same time , as quickly and as expeditiously as possible , purchase as many MRAPs as possible . Phase out Humvees . " <p> According to McGriff , the room again grew silent . Then , Mattis finally spoke : " That 's exactly what we 're going to do . " Mattis ' words failed to translate into action . The urgent-need request McGriff drafted went unfulfilled at Marine headquarters in Quantico . A June 10 , 2005 , status report on the request indicated the Marine Corps was holding out for a " future vehicle , " presumably the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle  --  more mobile than the MRAP , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In practical terms , that meant no MRAPs immediately . <p> McGriff foresaw some of the turmoil over vehicles in a prophetic 2003 paper for the School for Advanced Warfighting in Quantico . <p> " Currently , our underprotected vehicles result in casualties that are politically untenable and militarily unnecessary , " his paper read . " Failure to build a MRAP vehicle fleet produces a deteriorating cascade of effects that will substantially increase " risks for the military while " rendering it tactically immobile . " Mines and IEDs will force U.S. troops off the roads , he wrote , and keep them from aggressively attacking insurgents . <p> The words were strong and the conclusions were damning . Rhodesia , a nation with nothing near the resources of the U.S. military , had built MRAPs more than a quarter-century earlier that remained " more survivable than any comparable vehicle produced by the U.S. today , " McGriff wrote . <p> Despite his views then , McGriff , now a lieutenant colonel , says he understands the delays . MRAPs needed to be tested to ensure they could perform in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting and dying , " he says today . " But amidst the chaos , you still have to make the right choices . In the end , I think the Marines got the MRAP capability as quickly and safely as possible . " <p> Others disagree . <p> Marine major Franz Gayl , now retired , was science adviser to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force in Iraq . He saw how Marines were still being killed or maimed in Anbar in the fall of 2006 . If the Marine Corps had decided MRAPs were a top priority , he says , it could and should have pursued them with the same urgency the Pentagon is now showing . <p> " The ramp-up of industry capacity was delayed by over 1 1/2 years , " Gayl says , " until it became the dire emergency that it is today . " <p> Bureaucrats did n't want the MRAP sooner " because it would compete against " armored Humvees and " many other favored programs " for funding , Gayl says . Gayl , who works as a civilian for the Marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he fears retaliation for speaking out about the failure to get MRAPs sooner . <p> Defense Secretary Gates ' Lives are at stake ' <p> After McGriff addressed the generals in March 2005 , another 15 months passed . Then the Marines in Iraq reiterated the request for MRAPs . This time they sent the request directly to the Joint Chiefs . This time they were successful . <p> In December 2006 , after insurgent bombs had killed almost 1,200 U.S. troops in Iraq , the Joint Chiefs validated requests from Iraq for 4,060 MRAPs , and the formal MRAP program was launched . <p> By March 2007 , Marine Corps Commandant James Conway called the vehicle his " No. 1 unfilled warfighting requirement . " <p> In part , that 's because he saw it save lives in Anbar province . Brig . Gen. John Allen , deputy commander of coalition forces there , says the Marines tracked attacks on MRAPs since January 2006 . The finding : Marines in armored Humvees are twice as likely to be badly wounded in an IED attack as those in MRAPs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more than 300 attacks on MRAPs there . <p> The news , revealed in USA TODAY on April 19 , drew the attention of Defense Secretary Gates , four months into his job at the Pentagon . He was traveling in Iraq and read about the MRAP 's success in the Pentagon 's daily news roundup . Weeks later , at a news conference , Gates said the Pentagon would rush MRAPs to Iraq " as best we can . " <p> Late last month , top Pentagon officials approved an Army strategy for buying as many as 17,700 MRAPs , allowing a one-for-one swap for its armored Humvees . About 5,200 MRAPs had been approved for the other services . Now , Pentagon officials decline to say exactly how many MRAPs they need . <p> One official says they 'll build MRAPs as fast as possible , then recalibrate the military 's needs as they assess operations in Iraq , a tacit acknowledgment that they may need fewer MRAPs as U.S. troops are withdrawn . <p> During another news conference late last month , Gates worried that the companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Systems , General Dynamics , Oshkosh Truck , Armor Holdings , International Military and Government and Protected Vehicles ndash wo n't be able to get the vehicles to Iraq fast enough . <p> " I did n't think that was acceptable , " Gates said . " Lives are at stake . " <p> The young lieutenant ' Safest vehicle ever ' <p> As the sun began to bake the Iraqi countryside last month , Marine 2nd Lt. George Saenz headed back to his base on the outskirts in Fallujah . He felt oddly joyful . <p> Saenz had just spent hours leading his platoon through one of the most excruciating battlefield jobs  --  inching a convoy along the crumbling streets of Fallujah , searching for homemade bombs planted in the asphalt or dirt . <p> The night before had proved dangerous . Two bombs had blown up underneath Saenz 's convoy , including one beneath his vehicle . <p> As Saenz turned through the gray blast walls protecting the base , he says he could n't help but think : If I had been riding a Humvee , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was alive . His platoon in the 6th Marine Regiment Combat Team had replaced its Humvees with MRAPs . The two blasts produced just one injury , a Marine whose concussion put him on light duty for a week . <p> " We 're probably in the safest vehicle ever designed for military use , " Saenz says , recalling his platoon 's record : Three months . Eleven bomb attacks . No one dead . <p> MRAPs have become legendary in Anbar since Marines began using them on dangerous missions clearing roadside bombs . Tank commanders , radio operators and others drop by Saenz 's platoon every day to do what Rep. Hunter had done three years earlier  --  inspect the small fleet of MRAPs , knock on the armor , sometimes crawl inside . <p> Scores of MRAPs are scheduled to arrive in Anbar this summer . That means they 'll be available for the first time to the Marines for tasks other than clearing IEDs , says Marine Col. Mike Rudolph , logistics officer for U.S. forces in western Iraq . No one has decided how MRAPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rudolph says . <p> To be sure , the vehicle is n't perfect . Saenz 's team warns that MRAPs drive like trucks , plodding and heavy . Some models are so bulky they leave blind spots for troops peering over the boxy hood and so noisy a driver has to shout at someone 2 feet away . <p> " They 're just so heavy , " Sgt. Randall Miller says . " These are virtually designed off a semi-truck platform . " <p> After substantial testing , the military also has concluded that MRAPs are vulnerable to explosively formed projectiles , the newest and most devastating variation of the IED . More armor has been developed for the MRAPs the Pentagon ordered this spring . <p> Miller is n't complaining . On his first tour in Iraq in 2004-05 , Miller searched for land mines in a Humvee . His detection technique was simple : " Go real slow , cross your fingers . " He still drives slowly but feels safer knowing the MRAP 's V-shaped hull will deflect a bomb blast . " I 've seen our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're awesome , awesome vehicles . " <p> The widow ' They should 've done it ' sooner <p> Whom or what is to blame for the delay in getting safer vehicles for the 158,000 U.S. troops in Iraq ? <p> Jim Hampton , now a retired colonel , questions why the Pentagon and Congress did n't do more to keep the troops safe . " I have colleagues who say people need to go to jail over this , and in my mind they do , " Hampton says . <p> Hunter , now running for president , blames the Pentagon bureaucracy , which he says " does n't move fast enough to meet the needs of the war fighter . We have a system in which the warfighting requirements are requested from the field and the acquisition people say , ' We 'll get to it on our schedule . ' " <p> Other members of Congress blame Rumsfeld and his vision of transforming the military into a leaner , faster fighting force . <p> Rep. John Murtha , D-Pa. , wonders if Rumsfeld 's forceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimidated the military that I 've lost confidence in them telling us what they really need " in Iraq , Murtha says . <p> " They all knew the Rumsfeld rule : Your career is over if you say anything contrary " to his policies , Murtha says . " It 's much better now that Rumsfeld is gone . The military is being much more honest . " <p> If the Pentagon " had just listened to the guys in the field " who wanted MRAPs , Murtha says , " we 'd have them in Iraq right now . " <p> USA TODAY could not determine what role , if any , Rumsfeld played in MRAP deliberations . A spokesman for Rumsfeld , now running a foundation in Washington , said last week that the former Defense secretary would not comment . <p> Aaron Kincaid 's widow , Rachel , does n't know who should be held accountable . She is haunted by whether getting MRAPs to Iraq earlier might have saved her husband 's life . The bomb that blew apart his Humvee lay along the path he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Today , she wonders : Was his death really about the path that he took , or about the path the Pentagon spent years avoiding , the path that , in May , finally led them to the vehicle that might have saved her husband 's life ? <p> " You think there is always something that could 've been done to prevent it , " Rachel Kincaid says of her husband 's death . <p> " If that 's been around for that many years , " she says of the MRAP , " why has n't it been used ? They should 've done it at the beginning of the war . They should 've done it three years ago , four years ago .
