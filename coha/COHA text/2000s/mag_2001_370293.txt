It was a proud moment for Hispanic Americans last week when NBC unveiled its fall schedule in New York City . The network showed a clip of a rare TV show : a sitcom with a strong , charismatic Latino lead and broad audience appeal . <P> The bad news : the show was Chico and the Man , part of a reel of highlights from NBC 's history . By and large , major Hispanic TV characters are still just that , history  --  Freddie Prinze 's Chico , Desi Arnaz 's Ricky Ricardo  --  even though Latinos are America 's fastest-growing minority , now roughly equal in number to African Americans . The disparity is not new , but it has never been so embarrassingly glaring . According to the 2000 Census , Hispanic Americans number 35 million , or 12.5% of the population , a nearly 58% jump since 1990 . But on TV ? A report by the advocacy group Children Now found that in prime time , the number of Hispanic characters dropped since last season , from 3% to 2% . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans 3% and Native Americans 0.2% ; they are 12.3% , 3.6% and 0.9% of the population . ) In all of prime time , Hispanics account for only 47 out of 2,251 characters . As for nonfiction TV , the Center for Media and Public Affairs found that Latino correspondents reported only 1.3% of all network evening-news stories in 2000 . <P> It was n't supposed to be this way . After the N.A.A.C.P. and affiliated groups attacked the lack of diversity on TV and threatened boycotts in 1999 , the networks recast series , appointed diversity czars and instituted minority recruitment and training programs . Last year , with the media and activists looking over the networks ' shoulders , those efforts produced results  --  mostly African Americans plugged into ensembles . But there is no Latino Cosby Show or even Steve Harvey Show . Hispanics still have trouble getting parts other than the perp , the victim or that newly resurgent figure , the maid/nanny . ( A rare exception was Esai Morales , recently added to NYPD Blue as Lieutenant Tony Rodriguez . ) In the Latino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like throwing meat to hungry dogs , " says Lisa Vidal , who co-stars as a cop on Lifetime 's police drama The Division . " Most of us do n't want to play only the victim or the accused roles , but we have to pay the rent . " <P> As for Latino producers , the diversity controversy provided brief entree . To a point . Jeff Valdez , producer of Nickelodeon 's The Brothers Garcia , says he began to get calls from networks that had blown him off before . " So I pitched three shows and never got a return call , " he says . " Now they can say they met with a real Hispanic and move on with their business . " <P> Film director Gregory Nava ( El Norte ) did parlay that moment into a TV deal , but not with a commercial network . CBS signed him to make American Family , a drama pilot starring Edward James Olmos , Sonia Braga and Raquel Welch , unusual in that it portrayed a Latino family whose kids are upscale strivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The show landed at PBS , which will air 13 episodes next season . Cable has filled in some of the breach too , notably on Showtime 's Resurrection Blvd. , TV 's first Hispanic drama , returning in June . Creator Dennis Leoni says the story , about a family with roots in the boxing world , " was the perfect metaphor of Latinos trying to fight , literally and figuratively , for a piece of the American Dream .
