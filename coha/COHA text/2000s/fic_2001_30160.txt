Isla Desolacin January 16 , 1:15 p.m The valley that had no name ran between barren hills , a long mottled floor of gray and green covered with soldier moss , lichens , and carpha grasses . It was mid-Januarythe height of summerand the crevasses between the patches of broken rock were mortared with tiny pinguicula flowers . To the east , the wall of a snowfield gleamed a bottomless blue . Blackflies and mosquitoes droned in the air , and the summer fogs that shrouded Isla Desolacin had temporarily broken apart , allowing a watery sunlight to speckle the valley floor . A man walked slowly across the islands graveled flats , stopping , moving , then stopping again . He was not following a trailin the Cape Horn islands , at the nethermost tip of South America , there were none . Nestor Masangkay was dressed in worn oilskins and a greasy leather hat . His wispy beard was so thick with sea salt that it had divided itself into forked tips . It waggled like a snakes tongue as he led two heavily burdened mules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice commenting unfavorably on the mules parentage , character , and right to existence . Once in a while the complaints were punctuated with the thwack of a sucker rod that he carried in one brown hand . He had never met a mule , especially a rented mule , that he liked . But Masangkays voice held no anger , and the thwacks of his sucker rod held little force . Excitement was rising within him . His eyes roamed over the landscape , taking in every detail : the columnar basaltic escarpment a mileaway , the double-throated volcanic plug , the unusual outcropping of sedimentary rock . The geology was promising . Very promising . He walked across the valley floor , eyes on the ground . Once in a while a hobnailed boot would lash out and kick a rock loose . The beard waggled ; Masangkay grunted ; and the curious pack train would move on once again . In the center of the valley , Masangkays boot dislodged a rock from the flat . But this time he stopped to pick it up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb , abrading small granules that clung to his skin . He brought it to his face and peered at the grit with a jewelers loupe . He recognized this specimena friable , greenish material with white inclusionsas a mineral known as coesite . It was this ugly , worthless rock that he had traveled twelve thousand miles to find . His face broke into a broad grin , and he opened his arms to heaven and let out a terrific whoop of joy , the hills trading echoes of his voice , back and forth , back and forth , until at last it died away . He fell silent and looked around at the hills , gauging the alluvial pattern of erosion . His gaze lingered again on the sedimentary outcrop , its layers clearly delineated . Then his eyes returned to the ground . He led the mules another ten yards and pried a second stone loose from the valley floor with his foot , turning it over . Then he kicked loose a third stone , and a fourth . It was all coesitethe valley floor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowfield , a bouldera glacial erraticlay atop the tundra . Masangkay led his mules over to the boulder and tied them to it . Then , keeping his movements as slow and deliberate as possible , he walked back across the flats , picking up rocks , scuffing the ground with his boot , drawing a mental map of the coesite distribution . It was incredible , exceeding even his most optimistic assumptions . He had come to this island with realistic hopes . He knew from personal experience that local legends rarely panned out . He recalled the dusty museum library where he had first come across the legend of Hanuxa : the smell of the crumbling anthropological monograph , the faded pictures of artifacts and long-dead Indians . He almost had nt bothered ; Cape Horn was a hell of a long way from New York City . And his instincts had often been wrong in the past . But here he was . And he had found the prize of a lifetime . Masangkay took a deep breath . He was getting ahead of himself . Walking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead packmule . Working swiftly , he unraveled the diamond hitch , pulled the hemp rope from the pack , and unbuckled the wooden box panniers . Unlatching the lid of one pannier , he pulled out a long drysack and laid it on the ground . From it he extracted six aluminum cylinders , a small computer keyboard and screen , a leather strap , two metal spheres , and a nicad battery . Sitting cross-legged on the ground , he assembled the equipment into an aluminum rod fifteen feet long , with spherical projections at either end . He fitted the computer to its center , clipped on the leather strap , and slapped the battery into a slot on one side . He stood up , examining the high-tech object with satisfaction : a shiny anachronism among the grubby pack gear . It was an electromagnetic tomographic sounder , and it was worth over fifty thousand dollars a ten-thousand down payment and financing for the rest , which was proving to be a struggle to pay off atop all his other debts . Of course , when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old partner . Masangkay flicked the power switch and waited for the machine to warm up . He raised the screen into position , grasped a handle at the center of the rod , and let the weight settle around his neck , balancing the sounder the way a high-wire artist balances his pole . With his free hand he checked the settings , calibrated and zeroed the instrument , and then began walking steadily across the long flat , staring fixedly at the screen . As he walked , fog drifted in and the sky grew dark . Near the center of the flat , he suddenly stopped . Masangkay stared at the screen in surprise . Then he adjusted some settings and took another step . Once again he paused , brow furrowed . With a curse he switched the machine off , returned to the edge of the flat , rezeroed the machine , and walked at right angles to his previous path . Again he paused , surprise giving way to disbelief . He marked the spot with two rocks , one atop the other . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , and came back , more quickly now . A soft rain was beading on his face and shoulders , but he ignored it . He pressed a button , and a narrow line of paper began spooling out of the computer . He examined it closely , ink bleeding down the paper in the mist . His breath came faster . At first he thought the data was wrong : but there it was , three passes , all perfectly consistent . He made yet another pass , more reckless than the last , tearing off another spool of paper , examining it quickly , then balling it into his jacket pocket . After the fourth pass , he began talking to himself in a low , rapid monotone . Veering back toward the mules , he dropped the tomographic sounder on the drysack and untied the second mules pack with trembling hands . In his haste , one of the panniers fell to the ground and split open , spilling picks , shovels , rock hammers , an auger , and a bundle of dynamite . Masangkay scooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the flat . Flinging the shovel to the ground , he began feverishly swinging the pick , breaking up the rough surface . Then he scooped out the loosened gravel with the shovel , throwing it well to the side . He continued in this fashion , alternating pick and shovel . The mules watched him with complete impassivity , heads drooping , eyes half-lidded . Masangkay worked as the rain began to stiffen . Shallow pools collected at the lowest points of the graveled flat . A cold smell of ice drifted inland from Franklin Channel , to the north . There was a distant roll of thunder . Gulls came winging over his head , circling in curiosity , uttering forlorn cries . The hole deepened to a foot , then two . Below the hard layer of gravel , the alluvial sand was soft and easily dug . The hills disappeared behind shifting curtains of rain and mist . Masangkay worked on , heedless , stripping off his coat , then his shirt , and eventually his undershirt , flinging them out of the hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back and chest , defining the ripples and hollows of his musculature , while the points of his beard hung with water . Then , with a cry , he stopped . He crouched in the hole , scooping the sand and mud away from a hard surface beneath his feet . He let the rain wash the last bit of mud from the surface . Suddenly , he started in shock and bewilderment . Then he knelt as if praying , spreading his sweaty hands reverently on the surface . His breath came in gasps , eyes wild with astonishment , sweat and rain streaming together off his forehead , his heart pounding from exertion , excitement , and inexpressible joy . At that moment , a shock wave of brilliant light burst out of the hole , followed by a prodigious boom that rolled off across the valley , echoing and dying among the far hills . The two mules raised their heads in the direction of the noise . They saw a small body of mist , which became crablike , broke apart , and drifted off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene with indifference as night settled upon Isla Desolacin.
