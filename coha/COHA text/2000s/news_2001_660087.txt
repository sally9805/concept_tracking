<p> It 's 8:50 a.m. , and Boston College basketball player Uka Agbai is already working his contacts . As he clears away his barely touched eggs and bacon , he flags down a team manager . But Uka 's question is n't about practice . Instead , he needs the lowdown on an assignment from his fellow media-ethics classmate . A take-home test is due today , but Uka has an extension until tomorrow . This is a glimpse of the other March Madness , the one that TV cameras do n't film . The one where Division I players conduct study halls in hotel rooms , work Spanish exercises on bumpy buses , and write papers on airplane trays . Where roundballers morph into secretaries , public-relations men , and sweet-talkers , reminding profs when they 'll be gone , arranging tests , and securing notes from classmates . Even as these potential pros showcase their athletic talent for scouts at the NCAA tournament , they must stay focused on academic performance . Before they were bumped in the second round , Boston College players got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes along with the pressure-cooker games . Two 9-to-5 jobs Players lives are ruled by schedules . Laminated itineraries for road trips tell them where to be and when . Before the season starts , players give professors a schedule of all away games . Free time in this business means sleep or study . On this day - between the regular season and the NCAA tournament - Uka ( pronounced YOU-ka ) already has the drained look of a factory worker who just got off a double shift . " It 's like having a 9-to-5 job while having another 9-to-5 job at the same exact time , " the sophomore explains . Even with the " four-and-twenty-hour rule " imposed by the NCAA in 1991 , where athletes ' participation in their sports is limited to a maximum of four hours per day and 20 hours per week , athletes still spend countless hours " voluntarily " practicing . In fact , an NCAA Division I athlete spends an average of 730 hours per year on his or her sport , says Richard Sheehan , author of " Keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a conservative estimate . Uka 's strategy for the tournament was to whittle away at his mountain of homework . " I do my homework really late at night because I feel that is the only free time that I have , " he says . Uka 's day is so piled with commitments he sometimes sprints to practice - and still does n't make it on time . " You have to know short cuts to get to practice and not be late , " he says , stepping around a dish rack as he slips through the employee entrance of the cafeteria kitchen . The communication major 's 15 credits of classes eat into his already packed schedule of practice , weight lifting , and film sessions to study other teams . He does a few Spanish exercises here , works on a speech about racial profiling there . Other players do n't want to be bothered , and put homework off until after the tournament . That method meant bench time for two UCLA players . They were removed from the starting lineup for their second-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-hour study session - just a week before finals . But lest players ' focus stray too far from school , academic advisers and " instructional assistants " travel with them . One such adviser is Dard Miller , the Boston College team 's maven of memory muscle . Dr. Miller , a learning specialist , led a mandatory study hall for four players during BC 's run . Two players , a cheerleader , and a team manager also had tests proctored by her when they returned from the tournament ( some professors even want tests given at a specific time ) . Miller also supervises players ' online reading habits , since the NCAA has a rule that e-mail and Internet use during the tournament must be academically related . But advisers are n't hand holders , says Miller . They teach critical-reading skills , brainstorming , and how to rewrite papers . During the season , some students must meet with Miller or other academic advisers three times a week . More than half the team is not required to check in , including Uka , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by to see her voluntarily , though . At most Division I schools , academic advisers e-mail the players ' professors a few times a semester , asking for attendance records and grades on tests and papers . This feedback helps them gauge the amount of help players need . Tracking starts as soon as they arrive on campus . Advisers oversee such minutiae as whether a player needs another source in his bibliography . And if students dip below the minimum GPA ( 2.5 to 1.67 at Boston College , depending on their major ) , the deans , not the advisers , contact them . " Before they even get in trouble with the NCAA , they are in trouble with the deans , " Miller says . This scrutiny , which is applied to all students , not just athletes , forces players to take homework on the road . The fight to stay focused Trying to study on the road is a battle with heavy eyelids and Mr. Sandman . " As a player , I remember one of the biggest hurdles with studying was not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bilas , who played on the Duke University Final Four team in 1986 . " The couch looked a lot better than the test . " Uka remembers working on a history paper on the bus . " Then they put on ' Gladiator ' ... , " he says , trailing off . Miller , who has studied athletes ' learning styles , tells them : " Say to yourself : ' What do I want to get out of this ? I 'm going to read for critical ideas ... ' If you ca n't focus , do a mindless task like the bibliography . " Players should aim for short , focused study stints during their " peak performance " time , Miller says , adding some guys are early birds , others are night owls . While their study may be focused , professors say athletes ca n't replicate discussion and " learning moments " that take place in class . Uka , for instance , missed a week and a half of public speaking during the season . Still , other experts say the experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're telling me that missing two weeks of school is more important than going to the Final Four and having that experience ? " asks Joel Kirsch , president of the American Sports Institute . " You got ta be kidding . " Professors are well intentioned , continues Dr. Kirsch , " it 's just that they do n't know what these athletes are experiencing . If they had that experience , they 'd be willing to miss their own classes as well . " Mr. Bilas puts it this way : " They 're not going to play your B-minus on ESPN Classic for the rest of your life , " adding that basketball teaches lifelong lessons - like concentration and focus . " Some faculty make allowances , " says Paul Spagnoli , a history professor and the faculty athletic representative at Boston College in Chestnut Hill , Mass . " Others take a harder line . " The " allowances " can be carried too far . Advocates for reform of college sports point to several high-profile incidents - most recently at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended in the fall semester for giving credit to two football players for coursework they did not do . Professors who take a harder stance often lock horns with athletes , Miller says . " If you have a teammate that blows off class and has a cavalier attitude , " she says , other players may face resentment . Uka agrees . " Oh , you think you 're a superstar ? " he says , imitating some professors . " I get irritated by that . You check all the dates I 've missed class , " he tells them , " then all my games . They match up . " Defying stereotypes The big-man-on-campus stereotype is n't the only thing that bothers Miller . She cringes at the misperception that players are cut off from the rest of campus . " They are not in any way a homogeneous group , " she says . Uka 's dorm room breaks all college-sports stereotypes . He does n't live with other basketball players , does n't eat with them , and he gets no special treatment . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lottery and was paired with someone he did n't know . His screen saver is a Sesame Street scene . His size 17 black slippers sit on the floor next to the bed where he folds his 6 ft. , 8 in. frame into the fetal position in order to fit . He likes to listen to Miles Davis when he 's studying , like he 's doing now , preparing for a presentation on advertising ethics . He 's only been to two of his group 's meetings because of team travel . Many would say Uka is an anomaly . His nice-guy vibe prompts random students to strike up conversations with him . He makes it a point to stop and chat . If he did n't play basketball , he says , " I 'd probably have an A average . I 'd have so much more time to do the work . " He also thinks he 's missing out on the social scene at college . " I talk to regular students and they say , ' I went to this party ' or ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to do this . " This son of Nigerian immigrants is willing to make the sacrifice in the hopes that he 'll be able to play in the NBA after college . But the NCAA tournament , he says , is n't everything , and if basketball does n't pan out , he 'd like to be a sports writer . " I see other things to be more important than just basketball ... like life . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Monitor
