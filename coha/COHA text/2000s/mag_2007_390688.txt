As a child in the 1950s , decades before Saddam Hussein took power , Hazim Hanna loved going to American movies in his northern Iraq hometown of Mosul . He wrote fan letters to his favorite Hollywood stars in schoolboy English and eagerly collected autographs from such actors as John Wayne , Robert Ford and the young Ronald Reagan . Their films provided far more than entertainment to the youngster , a relative says ; they were " his bridge to the outside world . " In Baghdad nearly a half century later , Hanna and his devoted wife of nearly 40 years , Emel Meskoni ( the given name means " hope " ) , welcomed the 2003 U.S. invasion that overthrew Saddam 's brutal regime . " In spite of the chaos , they felt that their dignity was restored , " their son recalls . Hanna and Meskoni became two of the first Iraqis to work as translators at the new U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in 2004 , and were acknowledged as two of the best . Within a decade or so , Hanna predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prosperity and progress . Instead , Iraq fell apart . Although Hanna and his wife never stopped expressing hope for their country , they were waiting for final approval to immigrate to the United States when kidnappers grabbed him , then her , this past May . A message appeared on an Islamist Web site in the name of the Islamic State of Iraq , a front organization for Al Qaeda in Iraq , trumpeting the killing of " two of the most prominent agents and spies of the worshippers of the Cross ... a man and woman who occupy an important position at the U.S. Embassy . " On July 8 the U.S. Embassy publicly announced that their bodies had been found and identified . The next day Ambassador Ryan Crocker sent an impassioned memo urging Washington to speed up the handling of immigrant visas for Iraqis . A senior administration official , asking not to be named on such a touchy subject , says the process is so slow because the Department of Homeland Security is creating " a logjam . " Even vehement opponents of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against defenseless Iraqis . Sitting beside Gen. David Petraeus , the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq , Crocker made that case last week before Congress . " I am certain that abandoning or drastically curtailing our efforts in Iraq will bring failure , and the consequences of such a failure must be clearly understood , " he said . " An Iraq that falls into chaos or civil war will mean massive human suffering-well beyond what has already occurred within Iraq 's borders . " He is hardly alone in his worries-particularly for Iraqis who have tried to help rebuild the country . " We genuinely are concerned about what happens when we leave , " says the security manager of an American contracting firm in Baghdad , speaking on background to avoid increasing the risk to his Iraqi staff . " They 're marked people . " A prominent Baghdad-based human-rights official , who is not authorized to speak to the media , puts it even more bluntly : " It 's going to be a bloodbath . " The murders of Hanna and his wife capture the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better Iraq seems plainly out of reach , and yet a worse one seems all too possible if we leave now . Hanna and Meskoni were the kind of people you would look for to build a nation-smart and stubborn and proud . Violence and fear have driven more than 2 million Iraqis into exile , and the International Organization for Migration says roughly 2.2 million others have been displaced inside the country , but the couple could not stand the thought of abandoning their Baghdad home . " Terrorists will take my house , " Hanna told relatives who urged him to leave . He was especially proud of his huge library . " He built his house , as we say in Iraq , brick by brick , " says Hanna 's former office mate at the embassy , Serwan , who does not want his full name used . Yet just before she died Meskoni told a friend that her " mission in life " had been completed by getting her three children out of Iraq ; she herself received a U.S. visa in April , her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Hanna 's earliest years he had a touch of Ben Franklin or Abe Lincoln about him . When he was 9 he took to reading his schoolbooks by the light of a street lamp outside his home in Mosul . He graduated from high school in 1959 with the third highest marks in the city , earning a scholarship to study petroleum engineering in England . When he returned to Baghdad in 1965 , he met his future wife at the Oil Ministry , where she worked as an English translator . Both were Christians , but from rival sects-she was Syriac Catholic , and he was Syriac Orthodox-and her family 's social standing was far above his . Her parents ' big , comfortable house was always full of intellectuals and writers . Still , she fell for the worldly style Hanna had picked up in England . He could dance . And her father could see that the boy had brains . Hanna took his wife with him when he returned to England in 1969 to earn his Ph.D . Their son was born there in 1971 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wendy Raybould , fondly recalls the tiny , pale Iraqi 's irrepressible nature : " At the christening , there I was , swanning around with this baby , while Emel was tearing around the house , making food , doing the washing up , making sure everyone had what they needed . She was a multitasker par excellence . " A year later the couple took their son home to Baghdad , where their first daughter followed in 1974 and a second in 1976 . ( The family has asked that we not give the children 's names . ) Those were the family 's happiest years , before Saddam took over as president in 1979 . Then Hanna began getting bypassed for promotions even though he was one of the best-educated technical advisers at the Oil Ministry . American technical journals published his articles , but he refused to join the ruling Baath Party . The family grew increasingly desperate . In 1992 , after Saddam 's disastrous invasion of Kuwait , the couple managed to smuggle their son safely out of Iraq . He spent the next few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hanna quit the Oil Ministry and sent his rsum as far afield as Singapore and Australia , but his expertise was 20 years old . The couple talked about applying for asylum , perhaps back in England , but decided against it . " They had their dignity and did not want to just sit there collecting income support , " their son says . " They felt this was a polite way of begging . " Hanna finally landed a teaching spot in Libya , where he spent two years alone , sending his pay home to Meskoni and their daughters in Baghdad . When he returned home in 1997 , Meskoni became the breadwinner , taking work as a translator at the Sri Lankan Embassy . Hanna 's outlook changed soon after September 11 . He was sure America would soon be looking for a new source of oil outside Saudi Arabia , home to 15 of the 19 hijackers , and Iraq 's dilapidated and largely untapped petroleum industry seemed just right for the purpose . After the U.S. invasion , the couple sent jubilant e-mails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it first . A friend of hers had been hired as a translator at the Coalition Provisional Authority and immediately recommended Meskoni , who was quickly put to work sifting the dictatorship 's vast files for evidence of Saddam 's crimes and anything else that might speed Iraq 's transition . It did n't take long for her to suggest that the CPA could use a man like her husband , with his English and oil expertise , to help make sense of the technical Arabic that cluttered the old regime 's documents . When the U.S. Embassy opened the next year , they were among the first Iraqi employees to be sent over . Meskoni became an administrator ; Hanna , one of the embassy 's top translators , was responsible for the Iraqi Constitution and draft oil law . As the insurgency began to spread , the couple , like others who worked for the Americans , began taking elaborate precautions to avoid being spotted as embassy employees . They would drive partway to work in their 1980 Toyota , always by different routes , before parking and finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden at all times and wore their shabbiest clothes to look unemployed and inconspicuous . They could have quit their jobs , they said , but staying home had become practically as dangerous . Early this year , after pressure from the media and Congress , the embassy 's Iraqi employees were finally promised U.S. visas , based on seniority . The couple promptly filed for theirs , and they wasted no time sending the last of their three children out of the country . ( Their older daughter had already left before the war . ) They wanted at least the option of going to America . On the morning of May 21 , they took a particularly dangerous route . A friend who had left the country had asked them to withdraw some money from his account at a bank in the notoriously unstable neighborhood of Amariyah . He said they should make the stop only if they happened to be in the neighborhood on other business , but they worried he might be low on cash . U.S. officials say the two had left the bank and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . The men grabbed Hanna and let Meskoni go . A few minutes later , the men called Meskoni on her husband 's mobile phone and brazenly told her to come back . When she did , they grabbed her purse and sent her away again . The purse held the couple 's embassy IDs . Meskoni spent the next week haggling with the kidnappers by phone . At first they demanded a $250,000 ransom , but she talked them down to $30,000 . She finalized her will and asked friends to pray for her and Hanna , but she never told her children what had happened . The day after the kidnapping she e-mailed her son : " Hi , How are you and how is the new flat ? We are okay here and remembering the good days that we spent together last year . We pray to God to meet again soon . Everything is fine here . Take care and talk soon . " The Americans reminded her that U.S. policy forbids ransom payments . Friends urged her to avoid the embassy and to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans are behind me , " she said . Her son says the kidnappers finally told her to come alone with the cash to a spot near the 14th of July Bridge , just across the river from the Green Zone , at 10 a.m. sharp . " If you come at 10:30 , he will be killed , " the voice warned . Meskoni was not seen again . About a month later , police found their two bodies and took them to the morgue . They apparently were killed the day after Meskoni disappeared . U.S. officials say no U.S. government employees or contractors had anything to do with the ransom payment . There are unconfirmed accounts that an Iraqi guard was killed and another was wounded trying to protect Meskoni from the kidnappers . Her son is convinced she would have faced the kidnappers with or without armed backup . " At a certain point she decided , " To hell with it . I am going down the grave with him ' ' , " the son says . " She was determined . " What mattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last phone calls , was that she had gotten all three of her children out of Iraq : " No one can say I did n't do that . " In one respect , Hanna and Meskoni had been better off than most of the estimated 100,000 Iraqis who have worked for the American military , contractors and civilian companies : embassy staffers had the chance to apply for U.S. residency . Although Jordan has taken as many as 750,000 Iraqis and Syria some 1.4 million , the United States will have approved only about 1,700 asylum requests by the end of September , according to a Homeland Security estimate . In late February the State Department notified its Mideast embassies of a program to give priority visas to Iraqis who had worked for the Americans and passed screening by the U.N . High Commissioner for Refugees , but few U.S. officials in the region were made aware of the program . The UNHCR approval process alone takes up to nine months ; countries like Sweden are able to process Iraqi asylum seekers in two weeks . U.S. officials say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees . But Iraqis have to pass security checks before the U.S. government hires them , and then they are subject to regular polygraph tests . Embassy translators seemed stunned to hear last week that the idea of letting them into the United States more quickly was at all controversial . Critics believe the White House does n't want to send the wrong signal by freely admitting that Iraqis are no longer safe in their own homes . And the United States can hardly afford to lose the services of Iraqis like Hanna and Meskoni-good translators are harder to replace than good diplomats . The sad conclusion to their sad tale is that even in death , the couple could not remain in Iraq . The embassy paid to have their bodies flown to an undisclosed country where their children can visit their graves in safety . Their son says the family is grateful .
