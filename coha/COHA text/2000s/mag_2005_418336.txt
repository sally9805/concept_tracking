See also additional image in Cover Image file of same issue Sea Ray named its latest bowrider the 270 SLX , though 270 XL would have sufficed , for if ever there was a boat made for extra-large , sun-soaked adventures on the water , this is it . Thoroughly equipped , gorged on technology and elegantly fashioned ( with a dash of bling-bling thrown in ) the 270 exemplifies what a modern sportboat should be . It 's a brawny action star with good looks and brains , too . Rigged with a 375-hp MerCruiser 496 Magnum Bravo Three sterndrive , our 270 zipped through Miami 's Government Cut at a top speed of 47.5 mph at 4500 rpm . Sea Ray reports a maximum of 51.8 mph at 4850 rpm with the same power package , but the test boat was n't spinning the right wheels and could n't reach peak efficiency . Lowering pitch usually raises engine rpm , so 25- or 24-inch-pitch props would likely have resulted in more rpm and more mph than our 26-inch props . Regardless , the Bravo Three 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling . The boat does n't get over the hump so much as it bursts onto plane . And the operator never loses sight of the horizon . While single-wheel Bravo One drives are available on both smaller and larger MerCruiser gas engines ( a 300-hp 350 Magnum MPI Bravo One is standard ) , I like the added oomph provided by the twin stainless props . The top-of-the-line 425-hp 496 Magnum HO Bravo Three version must be a scorcher . Before we get to the 270 's anatomy , a word on bowriders in general . These ubiquitous family fun machines typically range in size from 17 to 30 feet and are able to do a little bit of everything  --  joyride , cruise , wakeboard , fish . Smaller models are relegated to protected bodies of water , while bigger ones ( about 24 feet and up ) are suited for large lakes and saltwater shorelines . Much like coupes in the car world , bowriders can fall into a number of subcategories such as value , fish/ski , performance or luxury . Pat Blake , Sea Ray 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for the latter category , which is also occupied by the likes of Chris-Craft , Cobalt and Formula . " This is what we call our ' executive ' series , the creme de la creme , " he explains . " It 's for the customer who can afford a $300,000 sport cruiser , but at this point in life does n't need a boat that size . " The 270 also fills a " white space " for the builder between its 240 and 290 SLX models . Starting with the helm , the 270 pops with top-shelf features . Taking its cue from the consoles found in fine automobiles , the dash incorporates a standard Navman chartplotter with a five-inch color display . The wood-accented wheel comes with thumb pads that manage the Mercury SmartCraft functions and stereo ; Sea Ray calls this its Vessel Control System , or VCS . To either side of the wheel , retro-style stainless switch guards separate the accessory toggles . The opposite console houses a head compartment with a sink , pullout shower faucet and pump-out toilet ( a VacuFlush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're 5 ' 6 " or under ; elbowroom is exceptional . The entryway faces aft instead of to the side , which is notable because it makes for wider , easier access . However , anyone perched on the portside bucket seat will have to move each time a passenger needs to get to the compartment , as the broad door can not open unless the chair is swiveled and its bolster flipped up . Unlike many ski-oriented bowriders , which have back-to-back cockpit seats , the 270 offers a more cruising-friendly , U-shaped bench . A wet bar comes with cup holders , a sink and molded steps for starboard-side boarding . A cabinet under the Corian counter can hold an optional fridge ; a carry-on cooler with storage niche is accessed through a side door  --  not from under a seat cushion  --  so guests wo n't have to stand aside when you want a cold one . Hinged filler cushions hide the centerline transom walk-through . " People do n't like removable filler cushions , " Blake says . " They end up staying in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sunpad and has gull-wing doors with wet lockers underneath . A ski pylon obtrudes where the walkway meets the swim platform , but Sea Ray says it will replace this with a tow eye positioned below the small step here , which should help to prevent stubbed toes . A telescoping ladder mounted under the platform deploys easily from the water  --  but not so easily from above  --  and four horn-shaped grab handles double as tying-off points ( the boat also has six dedicated cleats ) . At the bow , there 's room around the forward-facing lounges for you to stretch out your legs , plus angled backrests for comfort and coaming pads for safety . Each lounge also has molded armrests with stainless grab handles . A pair of stainless cup holders are recessed into each sidewall . The ground tackle arrangement  --  including an anchor rode locker and a hatch with an optional electric windlass , mooring cleat and manual hand crank  --  is akin to what you 'd find on a larger cruising craft . Above all , the Sea Ray 270 SLX imparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleasing vinyl colors and textures , optional hull hues , stainless hardware and detailed interior ( every hatch has a gas assist , for instance ) . With this boat , no matter where you go , people will know you 've arrived . Illustration <p>
