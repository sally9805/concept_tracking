Fortunately for the field , John M. Walsh III was in the audience . The principal owner of Waltron LLC , a water-purification company in New lersey , Walsh had purchased several antique American quilts beginning around 1990 after seeing a TV program about the noted quilt artist Michael James-he was attracted by James 's work but too " unsophisticated about the field " to realize that he was seeing " a fascinating extension of the traditional quilt , a whole new medium . " Challenged by McMorris 's observation and soon thereafter enlisting her curatorial guidance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year of their collaboration , Walsh purchased 15 quilts . " Penny guided me extremely well , " he says . Her original concept was " to focus on the best quilts by the best artists , " with the result that others " would be happy to be part of the collection . " he now owns between 65 and 70 quilts , the most recent being/1 Strange Riddle by Michael James and Veil III by Kyoung Ae Cho , both from the Dairy Barn 's " Quilt National 2003 . " A guiding principle in making acquisitions has been , in Walsh 's words , " to document the full range of what is going on in the contemporary quilt movement-work that pushes the edges and work that just crosses the border from the traditional . " Leading quilt artists are included , but Walsh and McMorris also consider lesser-known makers as they canvass activities in the field , checking museum exhibitions , galleries and publications for artists creating in distinctive , expressive ways . In design terms the collection encompasses abstractions , reinterpretations of traditional quilt patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection can be described as elegant and sophisticated , it also has its share of playfulness and eccentricity .

His motivation is that quilt making is time-consuming yet not remunerative . Artists may not " feel so free to try an idea-they 're always having to think of'what will sell . ' ' " He and McMorris try to identify people who are exploring new directions and for whom a commission would be a " nice opportunity not to have to think about practical considerations . " They can give " full rein to their artistic instincts , " he says , but with one stipulation , that the design in some way refer to water . While the collection is displayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pieces are occasionally on loan to exhibitions , * the majority are carefully stored , laid out flat on twin beds and stacked with protective layering of sheets . Some of his approaches to exhibiting and storage were influenced by the noted quilt collectors Robert and Ardis James , who introduced him to McMorris at the Louisville symposium . " I 've always been struck by Jack Walsh 's openness and never-ending joy in finding new things , meeting the artists and furthering their careers , " says McMorris . " He 's a selfless collector-it 's not about him , it 's about them . " As a " champion for artists , " she says , Walsh " is always ready to share what he finds beautiful , if sometimes edgy and difficult . he wants people to know that there 's more to quilts than antiques .
