Like most of her classmates at Washington High School in Milwaukee , Wis. , La Shanda Trimble , 18 , is attentive to fashion trends ; it 's the particular trend she chooses that sets her apart . She 's a Goth , wearing black lipstick and nail polish , listening to bands like Linkin Park and Rob Zombie rather than rapper Nelly or R &B; star Ciara . She likes to wear her hair in pigtails instead of the more popularly accepted braids . The other kids do n't approve . " They think I should act like them , ' ' says the 11th-grader . " They like me to listen to rap and pop and wear , like , brand-new shoes . " <P> For these stylistic transgressions , Trimble is routinely punished . " I 'd be walking down to a class , and I 'd hear murmuring , and somebody would say , ' She 's going to put a spell on you . ' " One boy rode a broom into class to mock her ; another called her ugly and crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take it anymore . " I started crying uncontrollably , " she says . She 's behind in her classwork now because she avoids going to school whenever she can . <P> Bullies have lurked in hallways and on playgrounds ever since history 's first day of school , and until recently , dealing with them was considered just another painfully useful life lesson . But that attitude is changing . In 2002 the American Medical Association warned that bullying is a public-health issue with long-term mental-health consequences for both bullies and their victims . Just last month UCLA researchers published two new studies showing that bullying is much more widespread and harmful than anyone knew . <P> During a two-week period at two ethnically diverse Los Angeles middle schools , says Adrienne Nishina , a post-doctoral scholar at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies , nearly half the 192 kids she interviewed reported being bullied at least once ; even more said they had seen others targeted . Also important , says Nishina : kids are frequently as distressed by witnessing bullying as by being bullied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but another study published last week in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine attributes it at least in part to excessive television viewing . ( Perhaps time spent in front of the tube is time spent not learning social skills . ) But bullying existed long before TV , and while this may help explain the persistence of the problem , it does n't do much more . <P> Whatever the reason for bullying , the consequences are clear . Nishina found that victims feel sick more often than their classmates do , are absent more often and tend to have lower grades . They are also more depressed and withdrawn  --  a natural reaction , says Nishina , but one that " can subsequently lead to more victimization . " The studies also indicate that schools take too narrow a view of what constitutes bullying . Physical aggression is forbidden , as are such forms of verbal bullying as sexual harassment and racial slurs . But the rules are generally silent about less incendiary name calling . " You 're probably not going to get into trouble if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But our research suggests victimized students felt equally bad . "
