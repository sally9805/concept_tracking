Chapter One My mom used to say , " Winnie Willis , in the beginning God created heaven and earth and horses . And sometimes I have to wonder if the good Lord should n't have quit while he was ahead . " She knew that was how I felt . She always knew . I wished Mom could have been right here with me , riding bareback , riding double . Instead , white fog thick as a horse 's tail made everything feel upside down as my sister and I headed home from the stable , keeping to the dirt path . I 'd never thought of July in Ohio as foggy . Lizzy , my " little sis , " darted past me to walk the dirt path backwards while talking as fast as a horse 's trot . At 11 years old-a solid year younger than me-she towers two inches over me . We both got Mom 's green eyes and dark hair , but Lizzy dodged the freckles . Lizzy claims my voice is low and raspy and would sound great on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarse . " Winnie ? " Lizzy 's voice , usually soft as a Morgan mare 's winter coat , sharpened . " Have you heard a word I 've said ? " " Nope , " I answered , picking up the scent of pines and poplar trees from the fields ... ... and maybe horse ? At least a half mile behind us was Stable-Mart , the sorry excuse for a stable , where I had the royal job of mucking out stalls . Anything to be nearhorses . " I said ... , " Lizzy shouted , like the problem was something her volume could fix , " I 'm cooking my famous tuna casserole-Dad 's favorite . I want him to love living in Ashland ! " I sighed . " Winnie ! " Lizzy said . " Dad could yank us out of Ohio and move us again to who-knows-where ! " I shrugged . " How can you not care ? I want to go to the whole sixth grade here ! " Lizzy demanded . " I ca n't even remember where I finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd gone to fifth grade . I told him , ' The I states-Illinois , Indiana , and ... ' What was the last one ? Oh yeah-'Iowa . ' Well not this year ! Huh-uh ! No way , Winnie . " I could remember every school , down to the missing L in Miler Elementary . I could picture the cracks in my desk in Chicago , the paint at the left bottom corner of the window in Des Moines Middle School . When I was in first grade in Wyoming , we found out I have a photographic memory . Not a super memory-just a photographic one . If my mind does n't snap a picture when something happens , I still forget stuff . Dad always thought I should be a better student , back when he thought about things like that . I admit , sometimes my memory works great on names and dates for history tests . It 's like I can still see words and numbers on a page . But a photographic memory is not so great for getting rid of pictures I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother 's arm , limp as a ribbon over the steering wheel . I picked up a rock and pitched it as far as I could . We 'd moved five times in the two years since we 'd sold our ranch in Wyoming . Ashland , Ohio , did n't seem much different than the other places , only smaller . " Well , you may not care about anything , Winnie , " Lizzy continued , " but I do ! I like it here . Crickets ! Ponds filled with frogs ! Roly-polies-the cutest little bugs ! And I 've never seen so many trees- " " Lizzy , shush ! " I held out my hand like I was stopping traffic . The ground shook-not much , but enough . Fog pressed against my eyeballs . Ahead of us , from down the hill through the mist , something thumped . " Do n't tell me to- ! " Lizzy started . " Shh-hh ! " I strained to hear it-ta-dump , ta-dump , da-dump , da-dump , closer and louder . Horses ! " Move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DA-DUMP ! DA-DUMP ! Louder and louder . " Four of them-no , five ! " I yelled , as Lizzy stumbled into the ditch , sputtering something I could n't make out . I held my ground , knowing they could n't be more than a few horses ' lengths away . One of the horses whinnied , a frightened burst of horse sadness and fear that tore at my heart . " Winnie ! " Lizzy screamed from the ditch . " Get out of the way ! " The sound of the horses ' hooves pounded inside my chest . I made out a blur of legs under the fog cloud-hooves , pasterns , cannons . The stride of the lead horse made her about 15 hands high . Like a vision , a white mare , silky mane flying , burst through the fog in front of me . " Easy , girl , " I said , raising my arms shoulder high , making a T with my body . " What 's the rush ? " I held my scarecrow position , not moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fog-white horse skidded in front of me , back legs crouching . She reared , pawing the fog , as if fighting invisible cloud horses . Two smaller horses parted behind her , snorting , not knowing whether to head for the hills or wait for her to do battle for all of them . But I could n't take my eyes off the ghostly mare . In the fog she appeared pure white . Her dish jowls , big eyes , and finely carved head left no doubt that she was Arabian . Arabians have black skin , but hers barely showed through her cloud-white coat , only casting a gray shadow near her leg joints . " You the boss here ? " I asked . Two Quarter Horses , a bay Thoroughbred , and a sunburned black Standardbred formed a half-circle audience . The mare continued to rear , her front hooves striking the ground , then springing up again . But her heart was n't in it . The springs grew shorter until they stopped . From the scars at her hocks , her jagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , no one had loved her for a long time , if ever . I held the mare 's attention in a kind of horse bluff as I muttered to her and kept my position . If I gave in first , she 'd figure she ruled me too . And I 'd better dive out of her way fast . But if I could make her give to me , she 'd know she did n't need to protect herself or her herd from me . From the ditch , Lizzy started , " Winifred Will- ! " But she stopped . Lizzy does n't like horses , but she knows enough not to yell around them . She 'd seen our mother talk down dozens of hot horses . Finally , the ghost mare blinked . She looked down , licking her lips , telling me , Okay , I 'll let you handle this . " That 's my girl , " I said , stepping closer . I touched her withers , the high part of her back between the shoulder blades . She let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt horses galloping a second before I heard the thunder of more hooves . But these sounded different , closer to the ground . The fog had lifted a bit , and I squinted to see two men on chestnut Quarter Horses cantering up the path toward us . " There they are ! " one of the men cried . I knew by his snakeskin boots that he was the Spidells ' son , Richard . Richard liked to play stable boss at his dad 's Stable-Mart . He reminded me of an overgrown kid playing cowboy . The Spidells owned just about everything in Ashland and never let anybody forget it . Richard sped up , galloping straight for us . " You ! Kid ! Get out of the way ! " The Arabian laid back her ears . I felt fear creep back into her muscles as Richard 's gelding pulled up beside us . " Grab that wild animal ! " the older man yelled , riding up beside Richard . The man 's voice startled the mare . She whinnied , then reared once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the mare headed straight for the ditch-Lizzy 's ditch . " Lizzy , get down ! " I yelled . The mare never broke stride . She galloped to the ditch and sailed over it , clearing with two feet to spare , her white tail high as a flag . " Great ! " Richard muttered . The other horses stirred , but looked as if they 'd had enough fun for one day and were ready to be led and fed . " I 'll take these on to the stable . You go after Wild Thing ! " Richard shouted at the man , keeping the easy job for himself . The man 's belly bounced over his saddle horn . His stirrups hung too short , so his legs doubled . He cursed , then took his anger out on his mount , kicking his heels into the docile Quarter Horse . " You are so human , " I muttered . The poor horse grunted and sprang like a Lipizzaner , then charged the ditch . But instead of taking it , he did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter with you ? " the man shouted , scrambling to get his seat back . Jerking the reins and regaining his stirrups , he let his horse take the long way down the path . " Who was that ? " I asked , staring after the vanishing white mare . " That ? " Richard said , circling his horse behind the abandoned herd . " Craig Barnum . He does the horse auctions . He 's worthless-could n't even get this lot from the auction barn to our stable . " " Not him , " I said , squinting for the faintest view of the gorgeous mare . " The Arabian . Who is she ? " " She 's a wild thing , " Richard said , spitting the words out . " Dad bought her at auction . He got stung though , if you ask me . That mare 's nothing but trouble . " Lizzy crawled out of the ditch as Richard trotted off , rounding up the other auction horses . " Winnie ? " Lizzy called . " Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon where I 'd last seen the beautiful , white ghost horse . My photographic memory had snapped a shot , leaving the horse 's image seared into my brain . " Winnie ! " Lizzy shouted , coming to stand next to me . " What are you looking at ? " " The horse I 've been dreaming about my whole life . " It was the truth , even though I 'd hardly made the connection before the words came out of my mouth . For as long as I could remember , when I 'd closed my eyes , I 'd been able to picture an Arabian-noble , white , wide-eyed-exactly like this one . " What are you talking about ? " Lizzy demanded . " Lizzy , " I said , calling up my mind 's picture of the rearing Arabian , " I have to have that horse . And I 'll do whatever it takes to get her . " ( Continues ... )                   @ @
