DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND OTHER WILY CHARACTERS I HAVE KNOWN // THE FIRST THING WE DO , LET 'S KILL ALL THE LAWYERS . - William Shakespeare // " I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB . " THAT 'S THE TIRED excuse offered up by every defense attorney whenever they 're asked how they do what they do-how they pull the wool over jurors ' eyes to make sure the repeat offender they 're defending walks free . I 'll never know how they can look in the mirror when their client goes out and commits yet another crime , causing more suffering to innocent victims . I 've heard , " I 'm just doing my job-it 's in the Constitution , " too many times to count . Just doing their jobs . They make it sound like they 're making doughnuts , drawing the yellow line down the street with a spray gun , or manning a toll booth on the freeway , nothing personal , just doing their jobs . In response , I agree with Dickens : " If that 's the law , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired excuse has been used to explain away wrongdoing throughout history . Everyone from the repo-guy to the utility worker who cuts off electricity to the needy to the parking-lot attendant who wo n't refund your quarters ' after you lose them in a broken meter to banks who foreclose on Christmas ... they all work the same excuse . They 're all just doing their jobs . When it comes to defense attorneys singing the same chorus , I do n't buy it . Justice is not " just a job . " The duty of a jury is to render a true verdict , a verdict that speaks the truth . How is that attainable when the " job " of defense attorneys is to use every means possible to get their clients acquitted-regardless of the truth ? // The 2002 murder trial of David Westerfield , found guilty of kidnapping and murdering his seven-year-old neighbor , Danielle van Dam , is one of the most horrifying examples of the true business of being a defense attorney . The minute her disappearance was made public , there was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteers , all desperately working around the clock to find any trace of this beautiful girl . They combed the hillsides , the brush , the canyons , and the creeks near the van Dams ' San Diego home . Danielle 's parents , Damon and Brenda van Dam , were completely distraught . // Brenda appeared on television over and over , begging for her daughter 's return . Her face was swollen from crying , her eyes were raw and red . While this was going on , Westerfield 's defense lawyer , Steven Feldman , was trying his best to bargain with prosecutors-to cut a plea deal . Feldman knew Westerfield had only one bargaining chip , the location of Danielle 's body . In exchange for life behind bars as opposed to death by lethal injection as dictated by California law , Westerfield would give up the location of the little girl 's remains . // Knowing full well his client was a child killer , Feldman went into open court to launch a defense that consisted of dragging the seven-year-old victim 's parents through the mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the jury and the world that the couple had once been swingers . The defense boldly claimed the van Dams had unwittingly introduced a sexual predator into their own home . Knowing it was n't true , Feldman argued someone else had killed Danielle-some predator linked to her parents . Nothing could be further from the truth . The predator was David Westerfield. // Feldman also chose to twist science itself to prove a series of lies to the jury . He produced a forensic entomologist to tell the jury that the larvae ( maggots ) on this beautiful child 's body were of such an age as to preclude Westerfield from suspicion . He reasoned that the larvae were hatched on the body at a time when Westerfield was already under tight surveillance by police , and therefore he could not possibly be the killer who disposed of the child 's body . // The argument was incredibly scientific and innovative-but hardly original . Turns out Feldman had used the exact same defense and the exact same " expert " in another murder trial and snagged an acquittal because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't creative , innovative , or clever , just tired and rehearsed . Most important , the defense did n't fit the facts of the case or the truth . // I am sick at heart that an officer of the court concocted that defense while knowing the whole time his own client knew where Danielle was hidden . Feldman is a veteran trial lawyer and under the law is entitled to put on the best case he can on behalf of his client . Still , it 's so disheartening that juries are hoodwinked every day by defense lawyers just " doing their jobs . " Our adversarial system allows it-in fact , encourages it . They get paid tons of money to do it . Successful defense attorneys are idolized , treated like rock stars . // And hey , they 're just doing their jobs . // " THE DARK SIDE " // Lewis R. Slaton was the elected district attorney of Fulton County in inner-city Atlanta , where I tried cases for ten years . He was like a grandfather to me , and when he announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shocked . I went to his office and begged him to serve another term . I said the public-and , most important , the city 's crime victims-needed him . But he was well into his seventies and wanted to spend his remaining years with his wife and say good-bye to the courthouse . What could I say ? I walked from his office with my head reeling , not knowing what I would do . I knew that the newly elected district attorney would likely fire all the top litigators left over from Slaton 's administration , as is the custom , and I would be left with the alternative every veteran prosecutor faces at some point : being out of a job and considering the " dark side " - defense work . // I had n't gone to law school to do slip-and-falls , write wills , or do real estate closings . After my fianc ? ' s murder , I abandoned my plan to teach college literature and entered law school specifically to help other crime victims-to try to do right . All I knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal prosecution and victims ' rights . In court , I was finally home . // When Slaton 's announcement was made public , I discovered a myriad of job possibilities to consider-all for a lot of money to boot . Unsolicited offers from criminal-defense firms started pouring in . The salaries thrown my way were more than I had ever dreamed of . If I took a defense job , I could say good-bye to my second ( and third ) jobs , exchange my car with the smoking engine for one that actually ran every day , and stop shopping exclusively at Marshalls and Kmart . But from the get-go , it was wrong . All wrong . // I accepted that as soon as the newly elected district attorney fired me , I 'd rather teach law school than be a defense lawyer . I sent out my r ? sum ? to local colleges and universities and hoped for the best . Then , out of the blue , came Court TV , which gave me a platform to speak out on behalf of victims ' rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trial lawyer , I packed up and headed to New York . // There was no way I could ever stand in front of a jury and use the knowledge and talents God gave me to " just do my job . " No way . I knew that if I ever did , I 'd look in the mirror every morning and see Keith 's blue eyes looking back at me. // DEFENDING THE INDEFENSIBLE // One night in July 2002 , I did on-air battle on Larry King Live with John Pozza , the articulate and engaging defense attorney who got Alejandro Avila , the accused killer of five-year-old Samantha Runnion , off the hook on child-molestation charges at Avila 's first jury trial in 2001 . From my perspective , that one court case could have saved Samantha 's life . // The Orange County , California , girl was abducted in broad daylight on July 15 , 2002 , as she played with her little friend in front of her house on a quiet residential street . Her grandmother was just steps away . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lost puppy . Samantha 's lifeless , nude body was found the following day , disposed of like trash alongside a rural highway and posed in a position suggesting sexual assault . Police suspected it was the work of a serial rapist who would strike again . // Based in part on tips from the public and a physical description given by Samantha 's five-year-old playmate , twenty-seven-year-old Avila , a production line supervisor at a medical-supply plant , was arrested on July 19 and charged with kidnap , murder , and sex crimes . Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona indicated forensic evidence , DNA , proved that Samantha was sexually molested before her death . The death penalty can be sought in that jurisdiction if murder occurs during the commission of another felony such as rape or kidnapping . In this case , both occurred . If convicted , Avila could face death by lethal injection . // At his court appearance , Avila , dressed in an orange jumpsuit over a white T-shirt and sporting a goatee , stood demurely beside his court-appointed lawyer , paid for by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the court 's questions and was careful not to reveal any more than he had to in open court . He denied any involvement in Samantha 's kidnapping . His mother , Adelina Avila , " alibied " him , saying he was at a local mall when Samantha went missing , although Avila 's cell-phone records apparently indicate otherwise . // Samantha 's horrific death could have been avoided . She could have lived and been spared the pain of kidnap , sex assault , and murder by asphyxiation . If she had lived , right now she 'd be in grammar school like her other little friends . That dream died when John Pozza , Avila 's defense attorney at his first trial , waged war against the two nine-year-old girls his client was accused of molesting. // I was sick when I learned Avila had been charged with the molestations of the first two victims . During that trial , Pozza argued the girls had been coached into making their claims of abuse , and , with a straight face , he claimed police had somehow planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shred of truth , but the defense lawyer argued them anyway . In January 2001 , Avila was acquitted on all counts , rode down in the elevator just like the jury did , and walked from the courthouse a free man . // " Quite frankly , I was surprised , " Pozza later said of the acquittal he himself had engineered . " A lot of the evidence that the prosecution or the police had gathered would give one the impression that there was evidence of guilt there , and certainly it would be our job as his defense team to look very closely at that evidence , " he said . Pozza reported he was " shocked " when he learned his former client was charged with molesting and murdering five-year-old Samantha . Shortly after Avila 's arrest , he told CNN , " It has thrown my entire world off course . " I ca n't imagine why . Criminal-defense lawyers and prosecutors alike know full well that molesters , especially , will strike again . They ca n't help themselves . They may not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he surprised ? // He was likely concerned , however , that the public had found out that his mission in court-to attack the truth and hide evidence from the jury-had had disastrous results and that people would begin to question his role , not just his client 's . The word was out . The world had actually learned that defense attorneys obscure the truth from the jury and that this time , as a result , a little girl had endured a brutal sex attack before being murdered . Pozza has stated that he was rethinking his career since Samantha 's death , but to one little girl 's loved ones that epiphany came too late . // Disagree with me if you want , but that 's how I see it . But for the fact that Pozza argued that cops planted porn on Avila 's computer , that two unsuspecting little girls had fabricated a story of sex abuse-while Pozza knew full well that Avila flunked his polygraph-Avila would have been behind bars that sunny afternoon when Samantha 's grandmother let her go outside and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his puppy . The afternoon she was assaulted and murdered . Pozza ca n't hide behind his " duty " as a defense attorney . He ca n't wash his hands of Samantha 's death . // Here 's what he said the night Larry King asked him about his role in Avila 's first trial : // KING : Did you believe your client did n't do it at the time ? POZZA : You know-at the time , Larry , I can not say whether or not I believed his guilt or innocence . And really , I am not the finder of facts . So I try to remove myself from that and , basically , present the best defense I can for my client . That 's what I do for every client . // I was shocked to hear a defense attorney admit he tries to remove himself from the actual truth of his client 's charges , especially when child victims are involved . I have no doubt in my mind his brand of practice is in part responsible for Samantha 's death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter 's death to include a jury who refused to believe two little girls , choosing instead to accept that the girls would lie and cops would plant pornography on Avila 's computer . // A few nights earlier , Samantha 's room , Erin Runnion , told Larry , " I blame every juror who let him go . Every juror who sat on that trial and believed this man over those little girls . I will never understand . And that is why he was out . And that is why his sickness was allowed to do this . " // That night , the Larry King Live staff had been very concerned for Runnion and worried about whether she could hold up for an entire hour 's interview . I was sitting in the darkened control room with the CNN crew as backup in case Erin Runnion broke down and could n't go on . I listened to her and my heart broke . I was overwhelmed with sorrow for this grieving mother . She was so brave . The next morning , that one single and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death was picked up by hundreds of news outlets covering the story and instantly transmitted around the world . // As far as I 'm concerned , the pedophile who killed Samantha is not the only one who 's sick . When Pozza and I sparred on Larry King Live , producers kept telling me , in my earpiece , to go easy on the defense lawyer , but I could n't . I was so distraught at what he had done . It turned into a knock-down , drag-out fight on air , with Larry breaking us up over and over . Another guest on the panel , **32;988;TOOLONG Mark Geragos , also joined in the fray , taking Pozza 's side . I cried the whole way home , torn up by the heartbreak that had shattered the Runnions ' lives . // When I thought of what Samantha 's mother had said about the little girl 's having a huge poster from the Disney movie Hercules over her bed , I broke down once again . When Mrs. Runnion tried to warn her daughter about " bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's response was so incredibly innocent . She said she 'd " be like Hercules , Mom , I 'll just run . " // Samantha was n't fast enough to outrun Avila , who had allegedly been trolling the neighborhood for little girls to molest . The justice system was n't clever enough for the likes of his first trial lawyer , who , in spite of the truth , managed to get his client acquitted . Samantha is dead , and he wonders why ? // Here 's why : Because defense attorneys truly believe it 's all a big game . A game they can win . Who can outsmart whom , who bests whom in court , who is clever enough to trick a jury into hating cops or disbelieving children who take the stand and swear to tell the truth . If I had to wake up every morning knowing my job was to get repeat offenders off the hook to roam the streets yet again , I swear I could n't practice law at all . But it 's all okay in their minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique take on ethics . They are simply doing their jobs-according to them anyway . Not according to me. // The game Avila and his new defense attorney , public defender Denise Gragg , are playing with the system continues today . As of this writing , Avila 's trial has been postponed numerous times . Delay is a defense lawyer 's best friend for a multitude of reasons : lost witnesses , fading memories , overcrowded jails and courtrooms . Any number of things can happen the longer a jury is prevented from hearing the case . The underlying reason the defense so often tries to delay a trial is simple : Every day of delay is another day the defendant is not guilty under the law . It 's another day of innocence ! //
