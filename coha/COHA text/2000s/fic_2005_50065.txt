SO THERE I WAS AGAIN sitting in one of the back booths at Bob 's Big Boy restaurant on Riverside Drive , walking distance from the Warner Brothers lot - having a private audience with Pope Daniel the First of The Church of the Chocolate Bunny ; well , as private as you could have in the back of a crowded restaurant . Never mind . <p> Pope Daniel is a.k.a . " That Pesky Dan Goodman , " whose acquaintanceship is one of those particular crosses a writer is required to bear . It 's unavoidable . As you fumble your way through life , you keep stumbling into certain people who insist on becoming part of your harass , whether you want them in it or not . In an earlier life , he had dragged me into The Mode Inquiry , which had later become The Mode Training , which had eventually gotten me into a lot of trouble in my personal life . But that 's another story . Whenever " That Pesky Dan Goodman " popped up sometimes at conventions or film festivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once - no , never mind about that too ; but whenever he appeared , the result was a deliberate injection of philosophical surrealism . I 'd learned to consider him as source material for all those stories I had no idea how to write . <p> Now , Pope Dan was candidly sharing that his karmic chicken had come home to roost-withavengeance - anditwasnot laying chocolate Easter eggs . The church had come into being as the result of a doctrinal schism in the Church of the Bunny , also a legitimate faith , but now several of his members were flirting with their own doctrinal dispute . <p> The subject at hand was whether the bunny was hollow or solid , or if in fact it might be filled with chocolate truffle . There was also some discussion of whether one should start by biting off the bunny 's ears or its tail , but this had not yet risen to the level where accusations of heresy were being made . <p> His Holiness had taken a tolerant view of the whole affair , saying only that the bunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harematic . Never mind . Pope Dan 's only stated position on the matter was that the darker the chocolate , the greater the spiritual access , with Dove Bars , Godiva truffles , and certain Swiss imports ranking quite high on the list of sacred tithes . <p> However , he was concerned that some members of the faith had fallen into degenerate practices . While the bunny did n't specifically frown on dipping fresh strawberries or orange slices into a thick dark sauce , there were some people who had expanded that repertoire to include ... well , rhubarb . His holiness had so far taken a cautious position on the matter - that the bunny really did n't want to be bothered with content , only with maintaining context ; that is , chocolate in any and all of its forms , regardless of detail . <p> Nevertheless , in private , the Pope was willing to concede that he felt somewhat repulsed by the rhubarbarian faction of the faith . " Rhubarb , " he said with rising passion , " is the devil 's abomination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vegetable bin where it belongs , but no it 's always recruiting other fruits and berries to get into pie with it , for detestable acts of misvegenation . But - " he admitted , " if I were to voice that view , I would be opening a jar of Gummi worms . What should I do ? Tolerate a position that I know in my heart of hearts betrays the pure chocolate soul of the bunny ? Or should I demand adherence to the sacred tenets and risk triggering an unfortunate heretical schism in the faith ? " <p> The waiter brought our food then , sol was spared the burden of having to take a stand on a spiritual matter . And after the waiter left , Pope Dan had already moved on to the real heart of his dilemma . " It 's the difference between context and content , " he said . " Context is the larger vision . Content is the circumstances - all the strategy and mechanics . All the doing . If you hold the context , then the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put your attention on the circumstances , you start losing context . And the context here is - " He considered for a moment . " - chocolate . " He took a bite of his double-deck Big Boy hamburger , chewed thoughtfully , then announced . " Never mind . I just answered my own question . " He did n't bother to give me the details though , and I was n't sure I wanted to ask . With " That Pesky Dan Goodman , " there are some discussions you really do not want to start . There is no off-button . <p> Abruptly , he looked across at me . " Anyway , that 's not why I asked you to meet me here today . " <p> Ordinarily , I would have begged off . I did n't always have the time or the energy for " That Pesky Dan Goodman , " but it was my day for errands , it was n't that far out of the way , and you do n't have to ask me twice to have lunch at the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was that other thing too . Whatever else he was , Pope Dan was never boring . So if he had something specific to ask , well , what the hell <p> He put the last of his burger back down on the plate , took a sip of his Coke , cleared his throat , and said , " How would you like to be a saint in the Church of the Chocolate Bunny ? " <p> " It 's an honor , to be sure , " I said noncommittally . " But do n't you have to be dead to be a saint ? " <p> " What fun is that ? Why not get your acknowledgment while you 're still around to hear it ? " <p> " There is that , " I admitted . " But I 'm not sure I deserve the honor . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> Shrug . " I do n't feel like a saint . " <p> " Nobody does . So what ? " <p> " I 'm a curmudgeon . My bad days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want courtesy , you need a subpoena . It takes a court order just to get me to return a phone call . Does that sound like a saint ? " <p> " And your point is ? " <p> " I 'm not a saint . " <p> " So what 's your definition of a saint ? " <p> Had to think about that one for a moment . " Um . Somebody who saves lives , somebody who serves as a good example , somebody who makes a difference in a good way ... stuff like that . " <p> " Stuff like that . Okay . " <p> " I have n't thought about it all that much . " <p> " That 's obvious . Usually , you bring a lot more clarity to your speaking . So what 's your definition of a saint ? " <p> " I thought I just answered that . " <p> " No . You threw some words at me . " <p> " I said I do n't know . " <p> " Not true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that . " His eyes bored into me . <p> *Sigh* Now you know how he earned the nickname Pesky . I started flipping through my mental filing cabinet , looking for the file that said saint . I found it , but mostly it was illegible . I had a vague illiterate sense that more accurate words belonged in this space , but I did n't have them yet . Hmm . I sat in silence and sorted through concept-symbols , looking for the ones that would most accurately evoke the experience of sainthood . Finally <p> " Gandhi , " I said . " Martin Luther King . " <p> " Those are people , not definitions . " <p> " That 's my definition . " <p> " Do you think Gandhi never had a bad day ? Do you think Dr. King never lost his temper ? " <p> " I never really thought about it . Maybe they did . But they obviously did n't give in to it . " <p> " Yes , they always remembered the context . The vision . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's this really about ? " <p> " Do n't change the subject . I am going to declare you a saint . " <p> " I 'm not worthy . " <p> " Yes , you are . Your reluctance to accept the honor is just the final bit of proof . " <p> " And if I say , ' Yes , I accept . I really really deserve this honor , ' the offer will be withdrawn , right ? " <p> " Wrong . How you feel about it is irrelevant . You 're a saint . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Why not ? " <p> That stopped me . Why not indeed ? I turned the thought over in my head . " Okay , so what if I really am worthy of the honor ? Does n't that count as the sin of pride ? " <p> " Not really . Worthiness and pride are two different things . What do you win by walking around feeling unworthy ? " He picked up the last of his burger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get more chocolate . " <p> " There is that about The Church of The Chocolate Bunny , " I said . " It has its tangible benefits . All your rewards are here . No waiting for graduation to the next plane . " <p> " That 's why you 're a saint today - and not after you die . Because I say so . I 'm the Pope . I can make anybody a saint I choose . " <p> And then I got it . I 'm not stupid , but sometimes it takes me a few minutes to get to punch line . " This has nothing to do with sainthood , right ? " <p> " No , it has everything to do with sainthood . " <p> " Eh ? " A word I learned from reading Heinlein . <p> " How come there 's no spiritual science ? " He downshifted into a much more serious manner . " We spend billions studying the farthest reaches of the universe . We spend billions on hardware and technology to fight disease . We spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more billions inventing ways to accurately target the people we want to blow up . We spend billions studying everything from whether or not there 's a gay gene on the X-chromosome to the fact that sales of strawberry Pop-Tarts go up seven-fold whenever a hurricane warning is issued . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " Really . So why do n't we spend the same amount of money studying God ? Maybe a few philosophers and theologians are nibbling around the edges , but for the most part , we 've got a lot of people making claims about the nature of God without much evidence to back up their assertions . " <p> I made a show of furtively glancing around the restaurant . " Careful , Your Holiness . People have been burned at the stake for less . " <p> " I 'm already classified as an agent of Satan , " he said , " for mocking the concept of religion . Hmpf . If I 'm an agent of Satan , where 's my ten percent ? " <p> " Fifteen percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He waved it away . " But you 're right . It 's a dangerous question to ask . Why is there no spiritual science ? " <p> " You want me to answer that , right ? That 's the purpose of this lunch - and the sainthood . Right ? " <p> He put on his Cheshire cat expression . That was all the answer I was going to get . <p> " All right . " I sighed . " I 'll tell you why there 's no spiritual science . Because there 's no science in spirituality . Science is the study of facts things that are measurable , testable , repeatable , verifiable . I wo n't bore you with the inevitable discussion of objective reality and how it 's ultimately unknowable because we filter it through our individual subjective realities , I 'll cut directly to the chase . Science is about the stuff we can agree on . Rocks are hard , water is wet . You do n't have to believe in the big yellow bus that runs along Riverside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will go ka-thump whether you believe in it or not . You do n't have those kinds of facts about God . What you have is a book . Several books . A whole bunch of books - " I stopped myself . Embarrassed . <p> " And - ? " His Holiness prompted . <p> " And I can tell you that books ca n't be trusted . I know that for a fact . I 'm a writer . I 've written more than forty books . Here 's everything you need to know about books . The writer always stacks the deck . Always . Next question . " <p> " I already knew that . I 've read your books . " Pope Dan was plussed the opposite of nonplussed . He sailed on , right over the edge . " Okay , now argue it from the other side . What if there 's a reason why God has to remain an unprovable fact ? " <p> " And that reason would be ? " <p> " Very simple . If you could prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Eh ? ' Splain me . " <p> " God is n't about proof . God is about faith . The minute you have hard evidence - factual evidence , like the kind you cited ; measurable , testable , repeatable , verifiable - the minute you have that kind of evidence , you do n't need faith anymore . It 's just like the big yellow bus . Whether you believe in it or not , it 's going to go - your word - ka-thump . " <p> " So belief is what we use instead of knowledge ? " <p> " I did n't say belief , I said faith . Two different things . What 's that Solomon Short quote you shared with me - " <p> I riffled through the mental rolodex . ' " Science is evidence without conviction . Faith is conviction without evidence . ' " <p> " No , not that one . The other one . The one about the cat . " <p> " Oh , right . It 's a paraphrase of Twain , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinctions . " I recited dutifully , ' " If a cat sits down on a hot stove , that 's experience . If it never sits down on a hot stove again , that 's knowledge . But if it never sits down on a cold one either - that 's belief . ' " <p> " Right . Faith has nothing to do with belief . Yes , I know that some people have confused the two terms . That 's convenient for them , but it 's philosophically and semantically inaccurate . Faith is your conviction in the possibilities before you . That 's all . Faith is your commitment to doing the right thing , no matter what , whatever it takes . Faith is n't about the circumstances , it 's about the larger vision . Not content - context . Okay ? " He pointed , gestured with his whole hand . " Now , if God were to manifest in provable ways , you 'd have no need for faith , would you ? God would be the big yellow bus . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for knowledge of what 's right and wrong , you would n't have to be responsible for yourself , you 'd just follow the rules - blindly . You would n't need a mind , you would n't need free will . Oh hell , you would n't even need a soul . " <p> " Hey , you 're forgetting - I work in television . I sold mine years ago . " <p> " You only rented it out . You reclaimed it when you left Star Trek but do you see my point ? God is a practical joker . The only proof of God is that we can not prove God . " <p> " C. S. Lewis beat you to it . ' Do you see the invisible cat ? Of course not , it 's invisible . see ? That proves it 's there . ' " <p> " Right . It 's the only way to take care of the invisible mice . But that 's the point . The only science of God that we can have has to lie in the realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a philosophical chew toy for intellectual terriers ? " <p> Pope Dan shook his head . " That 's the joke , son . Philosophy is not a spectator sport . We live our philosophies . Only most of us do n't know it . Most of us are unconscious to our personal philosophies . We make up a bunch of stuff without thinking about it . Men are this , women are that , northerners are this , southerners are that , blacks are this , whites are that , and so on . And then we live in that philosophy and we produce results that prove we 're right to think the way we do . And then we wonder why we only get just enough of what we want to make ourselves miserable . " He stopped abruptly . He must have seen the look on my face . <p> " You keep that up , " I said , " and people are likely to start taking you seriously . You might have to build that chocolate cathedral you 're always talking about . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the L.A. area . But thanks I think . " <p> " So what does all this have to do with saints ? That was where we started , remember ? " <p> " Exactly my point . What is the personal philosophy of someone whom you and I might consider a saint ? And why do some people have it and not others ? Where does it come from ? Why has n't science studied that ? That 's one thing we do have that we can study . Except for maybe a few transformational workshops here and there , is anyone really studying the technology of consciousness ? And I do n't mean brain studies or psychological experiments . I mean - " Pope Daniel the First stopped himself , regathered his thoughts , and came at the question from a different angle . " You 're a science fiction writer-science fiction is always about the essential question , ' What does it mean to be a human being ? ' So here 's the question I want answered . What makes a person a saint ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being ' 1 . Or is it some power of mind and soul that all of us are capable of ? This is why you 're a saint in my church . Of all the people I know , you 're one of the few who would actually take the time to consider the question seriously , and from outside the box . That 's the important part . So that 's why this lunch . " He reached across the table and scooped up the check . " This is on me . " <p> " Well , seeing as how I 've just been in the presence of a miracle - " I indicated the check in his hand , " I do n't see how I can refuse . But - " <p> " But what ? " <p> " I 'm not sure where to start . I 'm not even sure we 've answered the question . What 's a saint ? " <p> " Look around , " he said . " You 'll see examples all around you . Oh - " he interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride over to the LASFS1 clubhouse ? I 'll hang around the library for a few hours , then catch a ride home after the meeting . " <p> " It 's a little out of my way , but - sure . I can do it . But I need to stop for gas first . " The conversation wandered off-topic then , from the price of gas , to cars in general , to my son 's love of cars and his progress toward certification as an auto mechanic , to families in general , and by then , we had pulled into the Mobil station . <p> While I pumped the contents of my wallet into the gas tank of my car , I considered the question . I looked around the gas station , people-watching , examining the other drivers for evidence of sainthood . Do saints pump their own gas ? Apparently not . These people seemed resigned , frazzled , annoyed - anything but excited and interested . They did not look like they were having fun . <p> My attention was caught by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in need , - scraggly gray hair , ill-fitting clothes , probably scrounged from a Goodwill rack , dirty white socks and ragged tennis shoes . He had a limp and a stammer and an incongruous smile . Mentally impaired ? Could n't tell . I studied him with the dispassionate ease of a full belly . <p> A serious-looking young man in a windbreaker got out of a late model something . He reeked of education and success . As he fumbled his wallet out , the homeless man came hobbling across to him , a squeegee in his hand . " Sir , sir - let me wash your windshield , p-please . For a dollar , sir . It 's such a nice-looking car , you should take care of it . I 'm not b-begging , I just want to earn a few b-bucks for something to eat over at the Burger King . " <p> The young man did n't even look over . He turned away deliberately . On the back of his windbreaker , it said , " The happiest place on Earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . I 'm a human b-being , just like you . Just because I 'm homeless , that does n't m-mean you have the right to treat me rude . " The young man kept his back turned , kept his focus on the gas pump and the credit card he was sliding into it . " You work at the happiest place on Earth . You make people happy . That 's a gift . Let me give you a gift . Let me make you happy . I 'll even wash your windshield for free - " <p> Perhaps the young man had borrowed the jacket . Obviously , he worked somewhere else . Either that or I was now seeing why the so-called happiest place on Earth had earned the nickname Mouschwitz . Or Duckau . The back of the windbreaker was no longer a promise ; now it was an implacable corporate wall . The happiest place only if you had enough money to buy your way in . <p> Before he turned away , the vagrant brightened , " May the good lord bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then , as a late model white Camry slid into place , he hobbled toward it . An angry woman was already peeling herself out of the car . She had frizzy hair , dyed orange , and an expression like an act of violence . Before the man could even begin to speak , she started cursing at him . " Get away from me , you fucking bum . " <p> " You 've had a bad day , ma'am . Let me do something kind for you . You do n't have to give me anything , I 'll wash your windows just for a smile . " <p> " Do n't you touch my fucking car ! " she screamed at him . He backed away , visibly frightened . But then , his smile returned almost immediately . " It 's all right , ma'am . May the good lord bless you and keep you safe . " He turned away , his eyes scanning rapidly . The station was busy and he went immediately to three college students wearing expensive shoes and post-adolescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should take good care of it - " He was already reaching for the squeegee . <p> " Sorry , man - I ca n't spare anything . I need it all for gas . " <p> The vagrant turned and looked up at the evidence on the station 's sign . " Holy crap , " he said . " Yes , you do . You need your dollar more than me . I 'll clean your window for free . " <p> " No , man - that 's all right . Here - " One of the students peeled off a dollar and handed it to the homeless man . <p> " Bless you , bless you , young man . May the good lord smile on you tonight . " He waved and limped on to the next car . The driver pulled away before he got there . <p> I replaced the nozzle back on the pump , screwed the gas cap back on , then walked around to the passenger side window . I leaned down and spoke softly to His Holiness . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your saint . " <p> Pope Dan had seen the same incidents I had ; he nodded , then looked back to me . " Why him ? " <p> " Is n't it obvious ? Because even in the face of total rejection , ugliness , and hostility , he never lost his faith in other human beings . " <p> " And what does that say about you - being able to recognize that ? " <p> " Du n no , " I said . I was already pulling a twenty out of my wallet , hoping to buy a small piece of another man 's dignity . " Hey ! " I called . " Over here . No , you do n't need to do the windshield . I 'm paying you for the lesson . " <p> As I pressed the bill into his hand , he met my gaze directly . He saw the question in my eyes and nodded knowingly . Instead of blessing me , he leaned forward and whispered , " You want to know the secret , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - you ca n't ask people to be generous unless you first show ' em what it looks like . That 's all . " <p> He stuffed the twenty into the pocket of his jeans without even looking at it . Then he grinned and saluted , turned , and hobbled off to meet the next driver . <p> Footnote
