Unlike some crustaceans , who are coldly indifferent to the welfare of their offspring , the mamma lobster keeps her little brood about her until the youthful lobsterkins are big enough to start in life for themselves . - Crab , Shrimp , and Lobster Lore William B. Lord 1867 The birth of Ruth Thomas was not the easiest on record . She was born during a week of legendary , terrible storms . The last week of May 1958 did not quite bring a hurricane , but it was not calm out there , either , and Fort Niles Island got whipped . Stan Thomas 's wife , Mary , in the middle of this storm , endured an unusually hard labor . This was her first child . She was not a big woman , and the baby was stubborn in coming . Mary Thomas should have been moved to a hospital on the mainland and put under the care of a doctor , but this was no weather for boating around a woman in hard labor . There was no doctor on Fort Niles , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was without any medical attention . She just had to do it on her own . Mary whimpered and screamed during labor , while her female neighbors , acting as a collective of amateur midwives , administered comfort and suggestions , and left her side only to spread word of her condition across the island . The fact was , things did n't look good . The oldest and smartest women were convinced from early on that Stan 's wife was not going to make it . Mary Thomas was n't from the island , anyway , and the women did n't have great faith in her strength . Under the best of circumstances , these women considered her somewhat pampered , a little too fine and a little too susceptible to tears and shyness.They were pretty sure she was going to quit on them in the middle of her labor and just die of pain right there , in front of everyone . Still , they fussed and interfered . They argued with one another over the best treatment , the best positions , the best advice . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towels or ice for the woman in labor , they passed the word among their husbands that things at the Thomas house were looking very grave indeed . Senator Simon Addams heard the rumors and decided to make his famous peppery chicken stock , which he believed to be a great healer , one that would help the woman in her time of need . Senator Simon was an aging bachelor who lived with his twin brother , Angus , another aging bachelor . The men were the sons of Valentine Addams , all grown up now . Angus was the toughest , most aggressive lobsterman on the island . Senator Simon was no kind of lobsterman at all . He was terrified of the sea ; he could not set foot in a boat . The closest Simon had ever come to the sea was one stride wide of the surf on Gavin Beach . When he was a teenager , a local bully tried to drag him out on a dock , and Simon had nearly scratched that kid 's face off and nearly broken that kid 's arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senator Simon certainly did not like the water . He was handy , though , so he earned money by repairing furniture and lobster traps and fixing boats ( safely on shore ) for other men . He was recognized as an eccentric , and he spent his time reading books and studying maps , which he purchased through the mail . He knew a great deal about the world , although not once in his life had he stepped off Fort Niles . His knowledge about so many subjects had earned him the nickname Senator , a nickname that was only half mocking . Simon Addams was a strange man , but he was acknowledged as an authority . It was the Senator 's opinion that a good , peppery chicken soup could cure anything , even childbirth , so he cooked up a nice batch for Stanley Thomas 's wife . She was a woman he dearly admired , and he was worried about her . He brought a warm pot of soup over to the Thomas home on the afternoon of May 28 . The female neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already arrived . Everyone was fine , they assured him . The baby was hearty , and the mother was going to recover . The mother could probably use a touch of that chicken soup , after all . Senator Simon Addams looked into the bassinet , and there she was : little Ruth Thomas . A girl baby . An unusually pretty baby , with a wet , black mat of hair and a studious expression . Senator Simon Addams noticed right away that she did n't have the red squally look of most newborns . She did n't look like a peeled , boiled rabbit . She had lovely olive skin and a most serious expression for an infant . " Oh , she 's a dear little baby , " said Senator Simon Addams , and the women let him hold Ruth Thomas . He looked so huge holding the new baby that the women laughed-laughed at the giant bachelor cradling the tiny child . But Ruth blew a sort of a sigh in his arms and pursed her tiny mouth and blinked without concern . Senator Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . He jiggled her . " Oh , is n't she just the dearest baby , " he said , and the women laughed and laughed . He said , " Is n't she just a peach ? " Ruth Thomas was a pretty baby who grew into a very pretty girl , with dark eyebrows and wide shoulders and remarkable posture . From her earliest childhood , her back was straight as a plank . She had a striking , adult presence , even as a toddler . Her first word was a very firm " No . " Her first sentence : " No , thank you . " She was not excessively delighted by toys . She liked to sit on her father 's lap and read the papers with him . She liked to be around adults . She was quiet enough to go unnoticed for hours at a time . She was a world- class eavesdropper . When her parents visited their neighbors , Ruth sat under the kitchen table , small and silent as dust , listening keenly to every adult word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child was " Why , Ruth , I did n't even see you there ! " Ruth Thomas escaped notice because of her watchful disposition and also because of the distracting commotion around her in the form of the Pommeroys . The Pommeroys lived next door to Ruth and her parents . There were seven Pommeroy boys , and Ruth was born right at the end of the run of them . She pretty much vanished into the chaos kicked up by Webster and Conway and John and Fagan and Timothy and Chester and Robin Pommeroy . The Pommeroy boys were an event on Fort Niles . Certainly other women had produced as many children in the island 's history , but only over decades and only with evident reluctance . Seven babies born to a single exuberant family in just under six years seemed almost epidemic . Senator Simon 's twin brother , Angus , said of the Pommeroys , " That 's no family . That 's a goddamn litter . " Angus Addams could be suspected of jealousy , though , as he had no family except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people 's happy families was like a canker on Angus Addams . The Senator , on the other hand , found Mrs. Pommeroy delightful . He was charmed by her pregnancies . He said that Mrs. Pommeroy always looked as if she was pregnant because she could n't help it . He said she always looked pregnant in a cute , apologetic way . Mrs. Pommeroy was unusually young when she married-not yet sixteen-and she enjoyed herself and her husband completely . She was a real romp . The young Mrs. Pommeroy drank like a flapper . She loved her drinking . She drank so much during her pregnancies , in fact , that her neighbors suspected she had caused brain damage in her children . Whatever the cause , none of the seven Pommeroy sons ever learned to read very well . Not even Webster Pommeroy could read a book , and he was the ace of smarts in that family 's deck . As a child , Ruth Thomas often sat quietly in a tree and , when the opportunity arose , threw rocks at Webster Pommeroy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd tell her she was a stinkbutt . She 'd say , " Oh , yeah ? Where 'd you read that ? " Then Webster Pommeroy would drag Ruth out of the tree and kick her in the face . Ruth was a smart girl who sometimes found it difficult to stop making smart comments . Getting kicked in the face was the kind of thing that happened , Ruth supposed , to smart little girls who lived next door to so many Pommeroys . When Ruth Thomas was nine years old , she experienced a significant event . Her mother left Fort Niles . Her father , Stan Thomas , went with her . They went to Rockland . They were supposed to stay there for only a week or two . The plan was for Ruth to live with the Pommeroys for a short time . Just until her parents came back . But some complicated incident occurred in Rockland , and Ruth 's mother did n't come back at all . The details were n't explained to Ruth at the time . Eventually Ruth 's father returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up staying with the Pommeroys for months . She ended up staying with them for the entire summer . This significant event was not unduly traumatic , because Ruth really loved Mrs. Pommeroy . She loved the idea of living with her . She wanted to be with her all the time . And Mrs. Pommeroy loved Ruth . " You 're like my own daughter ! " Mrs. Pommeroy liked to tell Ruth . " You 're like my own goddamn daughter that I never , ever had ! " Mrs. Pommeroy pronounced the word daughtah , which had a beautiful , feathery sound in Ruth 's ears . Like everyone born on Fort Niles or Courne Haven , Mrs. Pommeroy spoke with the accent recognized across New England as Down East-just a whisper off the brogue of the original Scots-Irish settlers , defined by an almost criminal disregard for the letter r . Ruth loved the sound . Ruth 's mother did not have this beautiful accent , nor did she use words like goddamn and fuck and shit and asshole , words that delightfully peppered the speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth 's mother also did not drink vast quantities of rum and then turn all soft and loving , as Mrs. Pommeroy did every single day . Mrs. Pommeroy , in short , had it all over Ruth 's mother . Mrs. Pommeroy was not a woman who would hug constantly , but she certainly was one to nudge a person . She was always nudging and bumping into Ruth Thomas , always knocking her around with affection , sometimes even knocking her over . Always in a loving way , though . She knocked Ruth over only because Ruth was still so small . Ruth Thomas had n't got her real size yet . Mrs. Pommeroy knocked Ruth on her ass with pure , sweet love . " You 're like my own goddamn daughter that I never had ! " Mrs. Pommeroy would say and then nudge and then-boom-down Ruth would go . Daughtah ! Mrs. Pommeroy probably could have used a daughter , too , after her seven handfuls of sons . She surely had a genuine appreciation of daughters , after years of Webster and Conway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ate like orphans and shouted like convicts . A daughter looked pretty good to Mrs. Pommeroy by the time Ruth Thomas moved in , so Mrs. Pommeroy had an informed love for Ruth . But more than anyone else , Mrs. Pommeroy loved her man . She loved Mr. Pommeroy madly . Mr. Pommeroy was small and tight- muscled , with hands as big and heavy as door knockers . His eyes were narrow . He walked with his fists on his hips . He had an odd , scrunched-up face . His lips were always smooched in a half-kiss . He frowned and squinted , like someone performing difficult mathematics in his head . Mrs. Pommeroy adored him . When she passed her husband in the house hallways , she 'd grab at his nipples through his undershirt . She 'd tweak his nipples and yell , " Tweaky ! " Mr. Pommeroy would yell , " Whoop ! " Then he 'd grab her wrists and say , " Wanda ! Quit that , will you ? I really hate it . " He 'd say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd throw you out of the damn house . " But he loved her . In the evenings , if they were sitting on the couch listening to the radio , Mr. Pommeroy might suck on a single strand of Mrs. Pommeroy 's hair as if it were sweet licorice . Sometimes they 'd sit together quietly for hours , she knitting woolen garments , he knitting heads for his lobster traps , a bottle of rum on the floor between them from which they both drank . After Mrs. Pommeroy had been drinking for a while , she liked to swing her legs up off the floor , press her feet against her husband 's side , and say , " Feet on you . " " No feet on me , Wanda , " he 'd say flatly , not looking at her , but smiling . She 'd keep pressing on him with her feet . " Feet on you , " she 'd say . " Feet on you . " " Please , Wanda . No feet on me . " ( He called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke was on their son Robin , who-in addition to having the local habit of not pronouncing r at the end of a word-could not say any word that started with r . Robin could n't say his own name for years , no less the name of his mother . What 's more , for a long time everyone on Fort Niles Island imitated him . Over the whole spread of the island , you could hear the great strong fishermen complaining that they had to mend their wopes or fix their wigging or buy a new short-wave wadio . And you could hear the great strong women asking whether they could borrow a garden wake . ) Ira Pommeroy loved his wife a great deal , which was easy for everyone to understand , since Rhonda Pommeroy was a true beauty . She wore long skirts , and she lifted them when she walked , as if she imagined herself fancy in Atlanta . She wore a persistent expression of amazement and delight . If someone left the room for even a moment , she 'd arch her brows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when the person returned . She was young , after all , despite her seven sons , and she kept her hair as long as a young girl 's . She wore her hair swung up and around her whole skull , in an ambitious , glossy pile . Like everyone else on Fort Niles , Ruth Thomas thought Mrs. Pommeroy a great beauty . She adored her . Ruth often pretended to be her . As a girl , Ruth 's hair was kept as short as a boy 's , so when she pretended to be Mrs. Pommeroy , she wore a towel knotted around her head , the way some women do after a bath , but hers stood for Mrs. Pommeroy 's famous glossy pile of hair . Ruth would enlist Robin Pommeroy , the youngest of the boys , to play Mr. Pommeroy . Robin was easy to boss around . Besides , he liked the game . When Robin played Mr. Pommeroy , he arranged his mouth into the same smooch his dad often wore , and he stomped around Ruth with his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scowl . He liked the authority it gave him . Ruth Thomas and Robin Pommeroy were always pretending to be Mr. and Mrs. Pommeroy . It was their constant game . They played it for hours and weeks of their childhood . They played it outside in the woods , nearly every day throughout the summer that Ruth lived with the Pommeroys . The game would start with pregnancy . Ruth would put a stone in her pants pocket to stand for one of the Pommeroy brothers , unborn . Robin would purse his mouth all tight and lecture Ruth about parenthood . " Now listen me , " Robin would say , his fists on his hips . " When that baby 's bawn , he wo n't have any teeth . Heah that ? He wo n't be weddy to eat that hard food , like what we eat . Wanda ! You have to feed that baby some juice ! " Ruth would stroke the baby stone in her pocket . She 'd say , " I think I 'm about to have this baby right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby was born . It was that easy . " Would you just look at that baby ? " Ruth would say . " That 's a big one . " Each day , the first stone to be born was named Webster , because he was the oldest . After Webster was named , Robin would find another stone to represent Conway . He 'd give it to Ruth to slip into her pocket . " Wanda ! What 's that ? " Robin would then demand . " Would you just look at that , " Ruth would answer . " Here I go , having another one of those goddamn babies . " Robin would scowl . " Listen me . When that baby 's bawn , his foot bones 'll be too soft for boots . Wanda ! Do n't you go stick any boots on that baby ! " " I 'm naming this one Kathleen , " Ruth would say . ( She was always eager for another girl on the island . ) " No way , " Robin would say . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure enough , it would be . They 'd name that stone Conway and toss him down by his big brother , Webster . Soon , very soon , a pile of sons would grow in the woods . Ruth Thomas delivered all those boys , all summer long . Sometimes she 'd step on the stones and say , " Feet on you , Fagan ! Feet on you , John ! " She birthed every one of those boys every single day , with Robin stomping around her , hands heavy on his hips , bragging and lecturing . And when the Robin stone itself was born at the end of the game , Ruth sometimes said , " I 'm throwing out this lousy baby . It 's too fat . It ca n't even talk right . " Then Robin might take a swing , knocking the towel-hair off Ruth 's head . And she might then whip the towel at his legs , giving him red slashes on his shins . She might knock a fist in his back if he tried running . Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fat Robin . The towel would get wet from the ground . The towel would get muddied and ruined , so they 'd leave it and take a fresh one the next day . Soon , a pile of towels would grow in the woods . Mrs. Pommeroy could never figure that one out . Say , where 'd those towels go ? Hey ! What about my towels , then ? The Pommeroys lived in the big house of a dead great-uncle who had been a relative of both of them . Mr. and Mrs. Pommeroy were related even before they were married . They were cousins , each conveniently named Pommeroy before they fell in love . ( " Like the goddamn Roosevelts , " Angus Addams said . ) To be fair , of course , that 's not an unusual situation on Fort Niles . Not many families to choose from anymore , so everyone 's family . The dead Pommeroy great-uncle was therefore a shared dead great-uncle , a common dead great-uncle . He 'd built a big house near the church , with money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobster war . Mr. and Mrs. Pommeroy had doubly inherited the home . When Ruth was nine years old and stayed with the Pommeroys for the summer , Mrs. Pommeroy tried to get her to sleep in that dead uncle 's bedroom . It was under a quiet roof and had one window , which spied on a massive spruce tree , and it had a soft wooden floor of wide planks . A lovely room for a little girl . The only problem was that the great- uncle had shot himself right there in that room , right through his mouth , and the wallpaper was still speckled with rusty , tarnished blood freckles . Ruth Thomas flatly refused to sleep in that room . " Jesus , Ruthie , the man 's dead and buried , " Mrs. Pommeroy said . " There 's nothing in this room to scare anybody . " " No , " Ruth said . " Even if you see a ghost , Ruthie , it would just be my uncle 's ghost , and he 'd never hurt you . He loved all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not even blood on the wallpaper ! " Mrs. Pommeroy lied . " It 's fungus . It 's from the damp . " Mrs. Pommeroy told Ruth that she had the same fungus on her bedroom wallpaper every now and again , and that she slept just fine . She said she slept like a cozy baby every night of the year . In that case , Ruth announced , she 'd sleep in Mrs. Pommeroy 's bedroom . And , in the end , that 's exactly what she did . Ruth slept on the floor next to Mr. and Mrs. Pommeroy 's bed . She had a large pillow and a mattress of sorts , made from rich- smelling wool blankets . When the Pommeroys made any noise , Ruth heard it , and when they had giggly sex , she heard that . When they snored through their boozy sleeping , she heard that , too . When Mr. Pommeroy got up at four o'clock every morning to check the wind and leave the house for lobster fishing , Ruth Thomas heard him moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mornings . Mr. Pommeroy had a terrier that followed him around everywhere , even in the kitchen at four o'clock every morning , and the dog 's nails ticked steady on the kitchen floor . Mr. Pommeroy would talk quietly to the dog while making his breakfast . " Go back to sleep , dog , " he 'd say . " Do n't you want to go back to sleep ? Do n't you want to rest up , dog ? " Some mornings Mr. Pommeroy would say , " You following me around so you can learn how to make coffee for me , dog ? You trying to learn how to make my breakfast ? " For a while , there was a cat in the Pommeroy house , too . It was a dock cat , a huge coon-cat that had moved up to the Pommeroys ' because it hated the terrier and hated the Pommeroy boys so much that it wanted to stay near them at all times . The cat took the terrier 's eye out in a fight , and the eye socket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conway put the cat in a lobster crate , floated the crate on the surf , and shot at it with a gun of his father 's . After that , the terrier slept on the floor beside Ruth Thomas every night , with its mean , stinking eye . Ruth liked sleeping on the floor , but she had strange dreams . She dreamed that the ghost of the Pommeroys ' dead great-uncle chased her into the Pommeroys ' kitchen , where she searched for knives to stab him with but could find nothing except wire whisks and flat spatulas to defend herself . She had other dreams , where it was storming rain in the Pommeroys ' back yard , and the boys were wrestling with each other . She had to step around them with a small umbrella , covering first one boy , then another , then another , then another . All seven Pommeroy sons fought in a tangle , all around her . In the mornings , after Mr. Pommeroy had left the house , Ruth would fall asleep again and wake up a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd crawl up into bed with Mrs. Pommeroy . Mrs. Pommeroy would wake up and tickle Ruth 's neck and tell Ruth stories about all the dogs her father had owned , back when Mrs. Pommeroy was a little girl exactly like Ruth . " There was Beadie , Brownie , Cassie , Prince , Tally , Whippet . . . " Mrs. Pommeroy would say , and eventually Ruth learned the names of all the bygone dogs and could be quizzed on them . Ruth Thomas lived with the Pommeroys for three months , and then her father returned to the island without her mother . The complicated incident had been resolved . Mr. Thomas had left Ruth 's mother in a town called Concord , New Hampshire , where she would remain indefinitely . It was made pretty clear to Ruth that her mother would not be returning home at all . Ruth 's father took Ruth out of the Pommeroy house and back next door , where she was able to sleep in her own bedroom again . Ruth resumed her quiet life with her father and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she very much missed sleeping on the floor beside the bed of Mr. and Mrs. Pommeroy . Then Mr. Pommeroy drowned . All the men said Ira Pommeroy drowned because he fished alone and he drank on his boat . He kept jugs of rum tied to some of his trap lines , bobbing twenty fathoms down in the chilled middle waters , halfway between the floating buoys and the grounded lobster traps . Everyone did that occasionally . It was n't as if Mr. Pommeroy had invented the idea , but he had refined it greatly , and the understanding was that he 'd wrecked himself from refining it too greatly . He simply got too drunk on a day when the swells were too big and the deck was too slippery . He probably went over the side of his boat before he even knew it , losing his footing with a quick swell while pulling up a trap . And he could n't swim . Scarcely any of the lobstermen on Fort Niles or Courne Haven could swim . Not that being able to swim would have helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long slicker and heavy gloves , in the wicked and cold water , he would have gone down fast . At least he got it over with quickly . Knowing how to swim sometimes just makes the dying last longer . Angus Addams found the body three days later , when he was fishing . Mr. Pommeroy 's corpse was bound tightly in Angus 's lines , like a swollen , salted ham . That 's where he 'd ended up . A body can drift , and there were acres of ropes sunk in the water around Fort Niles Island that could act like filters to catch any drifting corpses . Mr. Pommeroy 's drift stopped in Angus 's territory . The seagulls had already eaten out Mr. Pommeroy 's eyes . Angus Addams had pulled up a line to collect one of his traps , and he 'd pulled up the body , too . Angus had a small boat , with not much room for another man on board , alive or dead , so he 'd tossed dead Mr. Pommeroy into the holding tank on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , whose claws he 'd pegged shut so they would n't rip each other into a slop of pieces . Like Mr. Pommeroy , Angus fished alone . At that time in his career , Angus did n't have a sternman to help him . At that point in his career , he did n't feel like sharing his catch with a teenage helper . He did n't even have a radio , which was unusual for a lobsterman , but Angus did not like being chattered at . Angus had dozens of traps to haul that day . He always fished through his chores , no matter what he found . And so , despite the corpse he 'd fished up , Angus went ahead and pulled his remaining lines , which took several hours . He measured each lobster , as he was supposed to do , threw the small ones back , and kept the legal ones , pegging their claws safely shut . He tossed all the lobsters on top of the drowned body in the cool tank , out of the sun . Around three-thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He anchored . He tossed Mr. Pommeroy 's body into his rowboat , where it was out of his way , and counted the catch into the holding crates , filled his bait buckets for the next day , hosed off the deck , hung up his slicker . When he was finished with these chores , he joined Mr. Pommeroy in the rowboat and headed over to the dock . He tied his rowboat to the ladder and climbed up . Then he told everyone exactly whom he 'd found in his fishing grounds that morning , dead as any idiot . " He was all stuck in my wopes , " Angus Addams said grimly . As it happened , Webster and Conway and John and Fagan and Timothy and Chester Pommeroy were at the docks when Angus Addams unloaded the corpse . They 'd been playing there that afternoon . They saw the body of their father , laid out on the pier , puffed and eyeless . Webster , the oldest , was the first to see it . He stammered and gasped , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers into a crazy formation , and broke right into a run home , together , in a bunch . They ran up from the harbor , and they burst , fast and weeping , past the roads and the collapsing old church to their house , where their neighbor Ruth Thomas was fighting with their littlest brother , Robin , on the steps . The Pommeroy sons drew Ruth and Robin up into their run , and the eight of them shoved into the kitchen at the same time and rushed into Mrs. Pommeroy . Mrs. Pommeroy had expected this news ever since her husband 's boat was found , three nights before , without her husband anywhere near it , floating far off course . She already knew her husband was dead , and she 'd guessed that she would never recover his body . But now , as her sons and Ruth Thomas hurled themselves into the kitchen , their faces stricken , Mrs. Pommeroy knew that the body had been found . And that her sons had seen it . The boys knocked into Mrs. Pommeroy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad brave soldiers and she was a live grenade . They covered and smothered her . They were grieving , and they were a real weight upon her . Ruth Thomas had been knocked over , too , and was sprawled out , confused , on the kitchen floor . Robin Pommeroy , who did not yet get it , was circling the pile of his sobbing brothers and his mother , saying , " What ? What ? " What was a word Robin could say very easily , unlike his own name , so he said it again . " What ? What ? Webster , what ? " he said , and he must have wondered at this poor snarl of boys and at his mother , so silent under them . He was far too little for such a report . Mrs. Pommeroy , on the floor , was quiet as a nun . She was cloaked in her sons . When she struggled to stand up , her boys came up with her , stuck on her . She picked her boys off her long skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each boy dropped off to the floor , he crawled back on her again . They were all hysterical . Still , she stood quietly , plucking them from her . " Webster , what ? " Robin said . " What , what ? " " Ruthie , " Mrs. Pommeroy said , " go on home . Tell your father . " Her voice had a thrilling , beautiful sadness . Tell yah fathah . . . Ruth thought it the prettiest sentence she had ever heard . Senator Simon Addams built the coffin for Mr. Pommeroy , but the Senator did not attend the funeral , because he was deadly afraid of the sea and never attended the funeral of anyone who had drowned . It was an unsustainable terror for him , no matter who the dead person was . He had to stay away . Instead , he built Mr. Pommeroy a coffin of clean white spruce , sanded and polished with light oil . It was a lovely coffin . This was the first funeral that Ruth Thomas had attended , and it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already showing herself to be an exceptional widow . In the morning , she scrubbed the necks and fingernails of Webster , Conway , John , Fagan , Timothy , Chester , and Robin . She worked their hair down with a fancy tortoise-shell comb dipped in a tall glass of cold water . Ruth was there with them . She could not stay away from Mrs. Pommeroy in general , and certainly not on an important day like this . She took her place at the end of the line and got her hair combed with water . She got her nails cleaned and her neck scrubbed with brushes . Mrs. Pommeroy cleaned Ruth Thomas last , as though the girl were a final son . She left Ruth 's scalp hot and tight from the combing . She made Ruth 's nails shine like coins . The Pommeroy boys stood still , except for Webster , the oldest , who was tapping his fingers nervously against his thighs . The boys were very well behaved that day , for the sake of their mother . Mrs. Pommeroy then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the kitchen table before her bedroom dresser mirror . She wove a technically complicated plait and arranged it around her head with pins . She oiled her hair with something interesting until it had the splendid sheen of granite . She draped a black scarf over her head . Ruth Thomas and the Pommeroy boys all watched her . She had a real gravity about her , just as a dignified widow should . She had a true knack for it . She looked spectacularly sad and should have been photographed that day . She just was that beautiful . Fort Niles Island was required to wait more than a week to stage the funeral , because it took that long to get the minister to come over on the New Hope , the mission boat . There was no permanent ministry on Fort Niles anymore , nor on Courne Haven . On both islands , the churches were falling down from lack of use . By 1967 , there was n't a large enough population on either Fort Niles or Courne Haven ( just over a hundred souls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the citizens shared a minister of God with a dozen other remote islands in a similar predicament , all the way up the coast of Maine . The New Hope was a floating church , constantly moving from one distant sea community to another , showing up for brief , efficient stays . The New Hope remained in harbor only long enough to baptize , marry , or bury whoever needed it , and then sailed off again . The boat also delivered charity and brought books and sometimes even the mail . The New Hope , built in 1915 , had carried several ministers during its tenure of good work . The current minister was a native of Courne Haven Island , but he was scarcely ever to be found there . His work sometimes took him all the way up to Nova Scotia . He had a far-flung parish , indeed , and it was often difficult to get his attention promptly . The minister in question was Toby Wishnell , of the Wishnell family of Courne Haven Island . Everyone on Fort Niles Island knew the Wishnells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lobstermen , which is to say that they were terrifically skilled and inevitably wealthy . They were famous lobstermen , superior to every fishing man . They were rich , supernatural fishermen , who had even managed to excel ( comparatively ) during the lobster wars . The Wishnells always tore great masses of lobster from any depth of water , in any season , and they were widely hated for it . It made no sense to other fishermen how many lobsters the Wishnells claimed as their own . It was as if the Wishnells had a special arrangement with God . More than that , it was as if the Wishnells had a special arrangement with lobsters as a species . Lobsters certainly seemed to consider it an honor and a privilege to enter a Wishnell trap . They would crawl over other men 's traps for miles of sea bottom just to be caught by a Wishnell . It was said that a Wishnell could find a lobster under a rock in your grandmother 's flower garden . It was said that families of lobsters collected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was said that Wishnell boys were born with tentacles , claws , and shells , which they shed during the final days of nursing .

If a Fort Niles fisherman was inland , doing business for a day in , say , Rockland , and he met a Wishnell at the bank or at the gas station , he would inevitably find himself behaving like an idiot . Losing all self-control , he would demean himself before the Wishnell man . He would grin and stammer and congratulate Mr. Wishnell on his fine new haircut and fine new car . He would apologize for his filthy overalls . He would foolishly try to explain to Mr. Wishnell that he 'd been doing chores around his boat , that these filthy rags were only his work clothes , that he 'd be throwing them out soon , rest assured . The Wishnell man would go on his way , and the Fort Niles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The Wishnells were great innovators . They were the first fishermen to use light nylon ropes instead of the old hemp ropes , which had to be painstakingly coated in hot tar to keep them from rotting in the seawater . The Wishnells were the first fishermen to haul traps with mechanized winches . They were the first fishermen , in fact , to use motorized boats . That was the way with the Wishnells . They were always first and always best . It was said that they bought their bait from Christ Himself . They sold huge catches of lobsters every week , laughing at their own sickening luck . Pastor Toby Wishnell was the first and only man born into the Wishnell family who did not fish . And what an evil and well-conceived insult that was ! To be born a Wishnell-a lobster magnet , a lobster magnate-and piss away the gift ! To turn away the spoils of that dynasty ! Who would be idiot enough to do such a thing ? Toby Wishnell , that 's who . Toby Wishnell had given it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over on Fort Niles as intolerable and pathetic . Of all the Wishnells , the men of Fort Niles hated Toby Wishnell the most . He absolutely galled them . And they fiercely resented that he was their minister . They did n't want that guy anywhere near their souls . " There 's something about that Toby Wishnell he ai n't telling us , " said Ruth Thomas 's father , Stan . " It 's faggotry , is what it is , " said Angus Addams . " He 's pure faggot . " " He 's a dirty liar . And a born bastard , " Stan Thomas said . " And it may be faggotry , too . He may just be a faggot , too , for all we know . " The day that young Pastor Toby Wishnell arrived on the New Hope to attend to the funeral of drowned , drunk , swollen , eyeless Mr. Pommeroy was a handsome early autumn day . There were high blue skies and keen winds . Toby Wishnell looked handsome , too . He had an elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His trousers were tucked into heavy , rubber fishermen 's boots to guard against the muddied ground . There was something unreasonably fine about Pastor Toby Wishnell 's features , something too pretty about his cleancut chin . He was polished . He was cultivated . What 's more , he was blond . Somewhere along the way , the Wishnells must have married some of the Swedish girls born to the Ellis Granite Company workers . This happened back at the turn of the century , and the soft blond hair had stuck around . There was none of it on Fort Niles Island , where nearly everyone was pale and dark . Some of the blond hair on Courne Haven was quite beautiful , and the islanders were rather proud of it . It had become a quiet issue between the two islands . On Fort Niles , blonds were resented wherever they were seen . Another reason to hate Pastor Toby Wishnell . Pastor Toby Wishnell gave Ira Pommeroy a most elegant funeral . His manners were perfect . He walked Mrs. Pommeroy to the cemetery , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newly dug grave . Ruth Thomas 's Uncle Len had dug that grave himself over the last few days . Ruth 's Uncle Len , always hard up for money , would take any job . Len was reckless and did n't generally give a damn throughout life . He had also offered to keep the body of drowned Mr. Pommeroy in his root cellar for a week , despite the protests of his wife . The corpse was sprinkled heavily with rock salt to cut the smell . Len did n't care . Ruth Thomas watched Mrs. Pommeroy and Pastor Wishnell head to the grave . They were in perfect step with each other , as matched in their movements as ice skaters . They made a good-looking couple . Mrs. Pommeroy was trying bravely not to cry . She held her head tilted back , daintily , like a nosebleeder . Pastor Toby Wishnell delivered his address at the graveside . He spoke carefully , with traces of his education . " Consider the brave fisherman , " he began , " and the jeopardy of his sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regarding their own fishermen 's boots . The seven Pommeroy boys stood in a descending line beside their mother , as still as though they 'd been pegged to the ground , except for Webster , who shifted and shifted on his feet as if he were about to race . Webster had n't stood still since first seeing his father 's body laid out on the pier . He 'd been moving and tapping and shifting nervously ever since . Something had happened to Webster that afternoon . He had become goosey , fidgety , and unnerved , and his reaction was n't going away . As for Mrs. Pommeroy , her beauty troubled the silent air around her . Pastor Wishnell recalled Mr. Pommeroy 's skills on the sea and his love of boats and children . Pastor Wishnell regretted that such an accident could befall so skilled a sailor . Pastor Wishnell recommended that the gathered neighbors and loved ones avoid speculating on God 's motives . There were not many tears . Webster Pommeroy was crying , and Ruth Thomas was crying , and Mrs. Pommeroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that was it . The island men were silent and respectful , but their faces did not suggest personal devastation at this event . The island wives and mothers shuffled and stared actively , reckoning the grave and reckoning Mrs. Pommeroy and reckoning Toby Wishnell and , finally , reckoning their own husbands and sons quite frankly . It was a tragedy , they were surely thinking . Hard to lose any man . Painful . Unfair . Yet beneath such sympathetic thoughts each of these women was probably thinking , But it was not my man . They were almost fully occupied with relief . How many men could drown in a year , after all ? Drownings were rare . There were almost never two drownings in a year in such a small community . Superstition suggested that Mr. Pommeroy 's drowning had made all the other men immune . Their husbands would be safe for some time . And they would not lose any sons this year . Pastor Toby Wishnell asked those gathered to remember that Christ Himself was a fisherman , and that Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of trumpeting angelic hosts . He asked that those gathered , as a community of God , not neglect the spiritual education and guidance of Mr. Pommeroy 's seven young sons . Having lost their earthly father , he reminded those present , it was now ever more imperative that the Pommeroy boys not lose their heavenly Father as well . Their souls were in the care of this community , and any loss of faith by the Pommeroy boys would surely be seen by the Lord as the fault of the community , for which He would punish its people accordingly . Pastor Wishnell asked those gathered to consider the witness and testimony of Saint Matthew as a warning . He read from his Bible , " But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea . " Behind Pastor Wishnell was the sea itself , and there was Fort Niles harbor , glittering in the hard afternoon light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the squatty fishing boats , gleaming prominently and looking lean and long by comparison . Ruth Thomas could see all this from where she stood , on the slope of a hill , next to Mr. Pommeroy 's grave . With the exception of Senator Simon Addams , everyone on the island had come to the funeral . Everyone was there , near Ruth . Everyone was accounted for . But down on the Fort Niles dock stood an unfamiliar big blond boy . He was young , but he was bigger than any of the Pommeroy boys . Ruth could tell his size even at that significant distance . He had a big head shaped something like a paint can , and he had long , thick arms . The boy was standing perfectly still , with his back to the island . He was looking out to sea . Ruth Thomas became so interested in the strange boy that she stopped crying over Mr. Pommeroy 's death . She watched the strange boy during the entire funeral service , and he did not move . He faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . He stood there , still and quiet . It was only long after the funeral , when Pastor Wishnell walked down to the dock , that the boy moved . Without speaking to the pastor , the big blond boy climbed down the ladder of the pier and rowed Pastor Wishnell back to the New Hope . Ruth watched with the greatest interest . But that all happened after the funeral . In the meantime , the service continued smoothly . Eventually , Mr. Pommeroy , idling in his long and leggy spruce box , was packed down in the dirt . The men dropped clods of earth upon him ; the women dropped flowers upon him . Webster Pommeroy fidgeted and paced in place and looked as if he might start running any minute now . Mrs. Pommeroy let go of her composure and cried prettily . Ruth Thomas watched in some anger as the drowned husband of her favorite person in the entire world was buried . Ruth thought , Christ ! Why did n't he just swim for it instead ? . . . Senator Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a protective canvas bag . Mrs. Pommeroy was making supper for her boys . She was still wearing her black funeral dress , which was made of a material heavy for the season . She was scraping the root hairs and rough skin from a bucket of her garden 's carrots . The Senator brought her a small bottle of rum , as well , which she said she thought she would n't be having any of , but she thanked him all the same . " I 've never known you to turn down a drink of rum , " Senator Simon Addams said . " All the fun 's out of drinking for me , Senator . You wo n't be seeing me drink anymore . " " There was fun in drinking once ? " the Senator asked . " There ever was ? " " Ah . . . " Mrs. Pommeroy sighed and smiled sadly . " What 's in the sack ? " " A gift for your boys . " " Will you have supper with us ? " " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Pommeroy said , " bring the Senator a glass for his rum . " But young Ruth Thomas had already done so , and she 'd brought him a chunk of ice , too . Senator Simon rubbed Ruth 's head with his big , soft hand . " Shut your eyes , Ruthie , " he told her . " I 've got a gift for you . " Ruth obediently shut her eyes for him , as she always had , ever since she was a very small girl , and he kissed her on the forehead . He gave her a big smack . That was always his gift . She opened her eyes and smiled at him . He loved her . Now the Senator put the tips of his two index fingers together . " OK , Ruthie . Cut the pickle , " he said . Ruth made scissors of the fingers on her right hand and snipped through his fingers . " Get the tickle ! " he exclaimed , and he tickled her ribs . Ruth was too old for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed . She smiled indulgently . They sometimes performed this little routine four times a day . Ruth Thomas was eating supper with the Pommeroys that night , even though it was a funeral night . Ruth nearly always ate with them . It was nicer than eating at home . Ruth 's father was n't much for cooking a hot meal . He was clean and decent enough , but he did n't keep much of a home . He was n't against having cold sandwiches for dinner . He was n't against mending Ruth 's skirt hems with a staple gun , either . He ran that kind of house and had done so ever since Ruth 's mother left . Nobody was going to starve or freeze to death or go without a sweater , but it was n't a particularly cozy home . So Ruth spent most of her time at the Pommeroys ' , which was much warmer and easier . Mrs. Pommeroy had invited Stan Thomas over for dinner that night , too , but he 'd stayed at home . He was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman freshly grieving the funeral of her husband . The seven Pommeroy boys were murderously glum at the dinner table . Cookie , the Senator 's dog , napped behind the Senator 's chair . The Pommeroys ' nameless , one-eyed dog , locked in the bathroom for the duration of the Senator 's visit , howled and barked in outrage at the thought of another dog in his home . But Cookie did n't notice . Cookie was beat tired . Cookie followed the lobster boats out sometimes , even when the water was rough , and she was always very nearly drowning . It was awful . She was only a year-old mutt , and she was crazy to think she could swim against the ocean . Cookie had been pulled by the current once nearly to Courne Haven Island , but the mail boat happened to pick her up and bring her back , almost dead . It was awful when she swam out after the boats , barking . Senator Simon Addams would edge near the dock , as close to it as he dared , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The young dog swam in small circles farther and farther out , sneezing off the spray from the outboard motors . The sternmen in the chased boats would throw hunks of herring bait at Cookie , yelling , " Git on outta heh ! " Of course the Senator could never go out after his dog . Not Senator Simon , who was as afraid of water as his dog was inspired by it . " Cookie ! " he 'd yell . " Please come on back , Cookie ! Come on back , Cookie ! Come on back now , Cookie ! " It was hard to watch , and it had been happening since Cookie was a puppy . Cookie chased boats almost every day , and Cookie was tired every night . This night was no exception . So Cookie slept , exhausted , behind the Senator 's chair during supper . At the end of Mrs. Pommeroy 's supper , Senator Simon caught the last morsel of pork on his plate with his fork tines and waved his fork behind him . The pork dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat thoughtfully , and went back to sleep . Then the Senator pulled from the canvas sack the book he 'd brought as a gift for the boys . It was a huge book , heavy as a slab of slate . " For your boys , " he told Mrs. Pommeroy . She looked it over and handed it to Chester . Chester looked it over . Ruth Thomas thought , A book for those boys ? She had to feel sorry for someone like Chester , with such a massive book in his hand , staring at it with no comprehension . " You know , " Ruth Thomas told Senator Simon , " they ca n't read . " Then she said to Chester , " Sorry ! " thinking that it was n't right to bring up such a fact on the day of a boy 's father 's funeral , but she did n't know for certain whether the Senator knew that the Pommeroy boys could n't read . She did n't know if he 'd heard of their affliction . Senator Simon took the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , he said . His great-grandfather had purchased the book in Philadelphia the only time that good man had ever left Fort Niles Island in his entire life . The cover of the book was thick , hard , brown leather . The Senator opened the book and began to read from the first page . He read : " Dedicated to the King , the Lords Commissioner of the Admiralty , to the Captains and Officers of the Royal Navy , and to the Public at Large . Being the most accurate , elegant , and perfect edition of the whole works and discoveries of the celebrated circumnavigator Captain James Cook . " Senator Simon paused and looked at each of the Pommeroy boys . " Circumnavigator ! " he exclaimed . Each boy returned his look with a great lack of expression . " A circumnavigator , boys ! Captain Cook sailed the world all the way around , boys ! Would you like to do that someday ? " Timothy Pommeroy stood up from the table , walked into the living room , and lay down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Webster sat , drumming his feet nervously against the kitchen tile . Mrs. Pommeroy said politely , " Sailed around the whole world , did he , Senator ? " The Senator read more : " Containing an authentic , entertaining , full , and complete history of Captain Cook 's First , Second , and Third Voyages . " He smiled at Mrs. Pommeroy . " This is a marvelous book for boys . Inspiring . The good captain was killed by savages , you know . Boys love these stories . Boys ! If you wish to be sailors , you will study James Cook ! " At that time , only one of the Pommeroy boys was any kind of a sailor . Conway was working as a substitute sternman for a Fort Niles fisherman named Mr. Duke Cobb . A few days every week , Conway left the house at five in the morning and returned late in the afternoon , reeking of herring . He pulled traps and pegged lobsters and filled bait bags , and received ten percent of the profits for his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was part of his pay . Mr. Cobb 's boat , like all the boats , never went much farther than a mile or two from Fort Niles . Mr. Cobb was certainly no circumnavigator . And Conway , a sullen and lazy kid , was not shaping up to be a great circumnavigator , either . Webster , the oldest boy , at fourteen , was the only other Pommeroy old enough to work , but he was a wreck on a boat . He was useless on a boat . He went nearly blind with seasickness , dying from headaches and vomiting down his own helpless sleeves . Webster had an idea of being a farmer . He kept a few chickens . " I have a little joke to show you , " Senator Simon said to Chester , the nearest boy . He spread the book on the table and opened it to the middle . The huge page was covered with tiny text . The print was dense and thick and faint as a small pattern on old fabric . " What do you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Chester stared . " There 's no letter s anywhere , is there , son ? The printers used f instead , did n't they , son ? The whole book is like that . It was perfectly common . It looks funny to us , though , does n't it ? To us , it looks as if the word sail is the word fail . To us , it looks as if every time Captain Cook sailed the boat , he actually failed the boat ! Of course , he did n't fail at all . He was the great circumnavigator . Imagine if someone told you , Chester , that someday you would fail a boat ? Ha ! " " Ha ! " said Chester , accordingly . " Have they spoken to you yet , Rhonda ? " Senator Simon asked Mrs. Pommeroy suddenly , and shut the book , which slammed like a weighty door . " Have who , Senator ? " " All the other men . " " No . " " Boys , " Senator Simon said , " get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk alone . Beat it . Take your book . Go outside and play . " The boys sulked out of the room . Some of them went upstairs , and the others filed outside . Chester carried the enormous , inappropriate gift of Captain James Cook 's circumnavigations outdoors . Ruth slipped under the kitchen table , unnoticed . " They 'll be coming by soon , Rhonda , " the Senator said to Mrs. Pommeroy when the room had cleared . " The men will come by soon for a talk with you . " " Fine . " " I wanted to give you some warning . Do you know what they 'll be asking you ? " " No . " " They 'll ask if you 're planning on staying here , on the island . They 'll want to know if you 're staying or if you 're planning to move inland . " " Fine . " " They probably wish you 'd leave . " Mrs. Pommeroy said nothing . From her vantage point under the table , Ruth heard a splash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollop of rum on the ice in his glass . " So , do you think you 'll stay on Fort Niles , then ? " he asked . " I think we 'll probably stay , Senator . I do n't know anybody inland . I would n't have anywhere to go . " " And whether you do or do not stay , they 'll want to buy your man 's boat . And they 'll want to fish his fishing ground . " " Fine . " " You should keep both the boat and the ground for the boys , Rhonda . " " I do n't see how I can do that , Senator . " " Neither do I , to tell you the truth , Rhonda . " " The boys are so young , you see . They are n't ready to be fishermen so young , Senator . " " I know , I know . I ca n't see either how you can afford to keep the boat . You 'll need the money , and if the men want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't very well leave it on shore while you wait for your boys to grow up . And you ca n't very well go out there every day and chase men off the Pommeroy fishing ground . " " That 's right , Senator . " " And I ca n't see how the men will let you keep the boat or the fishing ground . Do you know what they 'll tell you , Rhonda ? They 'll tell you they just intend to fish it for a few years , not to let it go to waste , you see . Just until the boys are big enough to take over . But good luck taking it back , boys ! You 'll never see it again , boys ! " Mrs. Pommeroy listened to all this with equanimity . " Timothy , " Senator Simon called , turning his head toward the living room , " do you want to fish ? Do you want to fish , Chester ? Do you boys want to be lobstermen when you grow up ? " " You sent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They ca n't hear you . " " That 's right , that 's right . But do they want to be fishermen ? " " Of course they want to be fishermen , Senator , " Mrs. Pommeroy said . " What else could they do ? " " Army . " " But forever , Senator ? Who stays in the Army forever , Senator ? They 'll want to come back to the island to fish , like all the men . " " Seven boys . " Senator Simon looked at his hands . " The men will wonder how there 'll ever be enough lobsters around this island for seven more men to make a living from them . How old is Conway ? " Mrs. Pommeroy informed the Senator that Conway was twelve . " Ah , they 'll take it all from you , for sure they will . It 's a shame , a shame . They 'll take the Pommeroy fishing ground , split it among them . They 'll buy your husband 's boat and gear for a song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from feeding your boys . They 'll take over your husband 's fishing territory , and your boys will have a hell of a fight to win it back . It 's a shame . And Ruthie 's father probably gets the most of it , I 'll bet . Him and my greedy brother . Greedy Number One and Greedy Number Two . " Under the table , Ruth Thomas frowned , humiliated . Her face got hot . She did not entirely understand the conversation , but she felt deeply ashamed , suddenly , of her father and of herself . " Pity , " the Senator said . " I 'd tell you to fight for it , Rhonda , but I honestly do n't know how you can . Not all by yourself . Your boys are too young to stage a fight for any territory . " " I do n't want my boys fighting for anything , Senator . " " Then you 'd better teach them a new trade , Rhonda . You 'd better teach them a new trade . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breathing . Then Mrs. Pommeroy said , " He was n't a very good fisherman , Senator . " " He should have died six years from now , instead , when the boys were ready for it . That 's really what he should have done . " " Senator ! " " Or maybe that would n't have been any better . I honestly do n't see how this could have worked out at all . I 've been thinking about it , Rhonda , ever since you had all those sons in the first place . I 've been trying to figure out how it would settle in the end , and I never did see any good coming of it . Even if your husband had lived , I suppose the boys would have ended up fighting among themselves . Not enough lobsters out there for everyone ; that 's the fact . Pity . Fine , strong boys . It 's easier with girls , of course . They can leave the island and marry . You should have had girls , Rhonda ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started breeding daughters . " Daughtahs ! " Senator ! " There was another splash in a glass , and the Senator said , " And another thing . I came to apologize for missing the funeral . " " That 's all right , Senator . " " I should have been there . I should have been there . I have always been a friend to your family . But I ca n't take it , Rhonda . I ca n't take the drowning . " " You ca n't take the drowning , Senator . Everyone knows that . " " I thank you for your understanding . You are a good woman , Rhonda . A good woman . And another thing . I 've come for a haircut , too . " " A haircut ? Today ? " " Sure , sure , " he said . Senator Simon , pushing back his chair to get up , bumped into Cookie . Cookie woke with a start and immediately noticed Ruth sitting under the kitchen table . The dog barked and barked until the Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the tablecloth , and spotted Ruth . He laughed . " Come on out , girl , " he said , and Ruth did . " You can watch me get a haircut . " The Senator took a dollar bill from his shirt pocket and laid it on the table . Mrs. Pommeroy got the old bed sheet and her shears and comb from the kitchen closet . Ruth pushed a chair into the middle of the kitchen for Simon Addams to sit on . Mrs. Pommeroy wrapped the sheet around Simon and his chair and tucked it around his neck . Only his head and boot tips showed . She dipped the comb in a glass of water , wetted down the Senator 's hair against his thick , buoy-shaped head , and parted it into narrow rows . She cut his hair one share at a time , each segment flattened between her two longest fingers , then cropped off on a neat bias . Ruth , watching these familiar gestures , knew just what would happen next . When Mrs. Pommeroy was finished with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be topped with the Senator 's hair . She would dust his neck with talcum powder , bundle the sheet , and ask Ruth to take it outdoors and shake it . Cookie would follow Ruth outside and bark at the whipping sheet and bite at the tumbling clumps of damp hair . " Cookie ! " Senator Simon would yell . " Come on back in here now , baby ! " Later , of course , the men did visit Mrs. Pommeroy . It was the following evening . Ruth 's father walked over to the Pommeroy house because it was right next door , but the other men drove over in the unregistered , unlicensed trucks they kept for carting their trash and children around on the island . They brought blueberry cakes and casseroles as offerings from their wives and stayed in the kitchen , many of them leaning on the counters and walls . Mrs. Pommeroy made the men polite pots of coffee . On the grass outside , below the kitchen window , Ruth Thomas was trying to teach Robin Pommeroy how to say his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating after Ruth , fiercely pronouncing every consonant but the impossible one . " rob-in , " Ruth said . " wob-in , " he insisted . " wob-in ! " " razz-berries , " Ruth said . " rhu-barb. rad-ish. " " wad-ish , " he said . Inside , the men offered suggestions to Mrs. Pommeroy . They 'd been discussing a few things . They had some ideas about dividing the traditional Pommeroy fishing ground among them for use and care , just until one of the boys showed interest and skill in the trade . Until any one of the Pommeroy boys could maintain a boat and a fleet of traps . " rubb-ish , " Ruth Thomas instructed Robin , outside the kitchen window . " wubb-ish , " he declared . " ruth , " she said to Robin . " ruth ! " But he would n't even try that one ; Ruth was much too hard . Besides , Robin was tired of the game , which only served to make him look stupid . Ruth was n't having much fun , anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and viscous , and Robin was busy slapping at his head . The mosquitoes were a mess that night . There had n't been weather cold enough to eliminate them . They were biting Ruth Thomas and everyone else on the island . But they were really shocking Robin Pommeroy . In the end , t he mosquitoes chased Robin and Ruth indoors , where they hid in a front closet until the men of Fort Niles began to file out of the Pommeroy house . Ruth 's father called for her , and she took his hand . Together , they walked to their home next door . Stan Thomas 's good friend Angus Addams came with them . It was past dusk and getting cold , and once they were inside , Stan made a fire in the parlor wood stove . Angus sent Ruth upstairs to the closet in her father 's bedroom to fetch the cribbage board , and then he sent her to the sideboard in the living room to fetch the good decks of cards . Angus set up the small , antique card table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the two men played . As always , they played quietly , each determined to win . Ruth had watched these men play cribbage hundreds of times in her young life . She knew how to be silent and useful so that she would n't be sent away . She fetched them beers from the icebox when fresh beers were needed . She moved their pegs along the board for them so that they would n't have to lean forward . And she counted aloud to them as she moved the pegs . The men said little . Sometimes Angus would say , " Have you ever seen such luck ? " Sometimes he 'd say , " I 've seen better hands on an amputee . " Sometimes he 'd say , " Who dealt this sorry rag ? " Ruth 's father beat Angus soundly , and Angus put down his cards and told them a terrible joke . " Some men are out fishing one day for sport , and they 're drinking too much , " he began . Ruth 's father put down his cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen . Angus narrated his joke with the greatest of care . He said , " So , these fellas are out fishing and they 're really having a time and drinking it up . They 're getting awful stewed . In fact , these fellas get to drinking so bad that one of them , the one named Mr. Smith , he falls overboard and drowns . That ruins everything . Hell ! It 's no fun having a fishing party when a man drowns . So the men drink some more booze , and they set to feeling pretty miserable , because nobody wants to go home and tell Mrs. Smith her husband is drowned . " " You 're terrible , Angus , " Ruth 's father interrupted . " What kind of joke is that for tonight ? " Angus continued . " Then one of the guys has a great idea . He suggests maybe they ought to hire Mr. Smooth-Talking-Jones to go break the bad news to Mrs. Smith . That 's right . It seems there 's a fella in town , name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talker . He 's perfect for the job . He 'll tell Mrs. Smith about her husband , but he 'll tell her so nice , she wo n't even care . The other guys think , Hey , what a great idea ! So they go find Smooth-Talking- Jones , and he says he 'll do the job , no problem . So Smooth-Talking- Jones puts on his nicest suit . He puts on a tie and a hat . He goes over to the Smith house . He knocks on the door . A woman answers . Smooth-Talking-Jones says , ' Pardon me , ma'am , but ai n't you the Widow Smith ? ' " At this , Ruth 's father laughed into his beer glass , and a thin spray of foam flew from his mug to the table . Angus Addams held up his hand , palm out . Joke was n't finished . So he finished it . " The lady says , ' Why , I am Mrs. Smith , but I ai n't no widow ! ' And Smooth-Talking-Jones says , ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toyed with that word in her mind : Sweethaht , sweet- hot . . . " Oh , that 's terrible . " Ruth 's father rubbed his mouth . He was laughing , though . " That 's terrible , Angus . Jesus Christ , what a rotten joke to tell . I ca n't believe you 'd tell a joke like that on a night like this . Jesus Christ . " " Why , Stan ? You think it sounds like someone we know ? " Angus said . Then he asked , in a strange falsetto , " Ai n't you the Widow Pommeroy ? " " Angus , that is terrible , " Ruth 's father said , laughing even harder . " I 'm not terrible . I 'm telling jokes . " " You 're terrible , Angus . You 're terrible . " The two men laughed and laughed , and then settled down a bit . Eventually , Ruth 's father and Angus Addams commenced playing cribbage once more and grew quiet . Sometimes Ruth 's father said , " Christ ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shot for that play . " At the end of the night , Angus Addams had won one game and Stan Thomas had won two . Some money was exchanged . The men put away the cards and dismantled the cribbage board . Ruth returned the board to the closet in her father 's bedroom . Angus Addams folded up the card table and set it behind the sofa . The men moved into the kitchen and sat at the table . Ruth came back down , and her father patted her bottom and said to Angus , " I do n't imagine Pommeroy left his wife enough money to pay you for that nice coffin your brother built . " Angus Addams said , " You kidding me ? Pommeroy did n't leave any money . There 's no money in that goddamn family . Not enough money for a pissant funeral , I can tell you that . Not enough money for a coffin . Not even enough money to buy a ham bone to shove up his ass so the dogs could drag his body away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , completely deadpan . " I 'm not familiar with that tradition . " Then it was Angus Addams who was laughing . He called Ruth 's father terrible . " I 'm terrible ? " Stan Thomas said . " I 'm terrible ? You 're the terrible one . " Something in this kept them both laughing . Ruth 's father and Mr. Angus Addams , who were excellent friends , called each other terrible people all that night long . Terrible ! Terrible ! As if it was a kind of reassurance . They called each other terrible , rotten , deadly people . They stayed up late , and Ruth stayed up with them , until she started crying from trying to keep herself awake . It had been a long week , and she was only nine . She was a sturdy kid , but she 'd seen a funeral and heard conversations she did n't understand , and now it was past midnight , and she was exhausted . " Hey , " Angus said . " Ruthie ? Ruthie ? Do n't cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruthie . " Ruth 's father said , " Poor little pie . " He took her up into his lap . She wanted to stop crying , but she could n't . She was embarrassed . She hated crying in front of anyone . Still , she cried until her father sent her into the living room for the deck of cards and let her sit on his lap and shuffle them , which was a game they used to play when she was small . She was too old to be sitting in his lap and shuffling cards , but it was a comfort . " Come on , Ruthie , " Angus said , " let 's have a smile out of you . " Ruth tried to oblige , but it was n't a particularly good smile . Angus asked Ruth and her father to do their funniest joke for him , the one he loved so much . And they did . " Daddy , Daddy , " Ruth said in a fake little-girlie voice . " How come all the other children get to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shut up and deal , kid , " her father growled . Angus Addams laughed and laughed . " That 's terrible ! " he said . " You 're both terrible . "
