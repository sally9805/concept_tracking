Chapter 7 December began with a blizzard . Fifteen inches of snow covered Cincinnati like a thick , white winter blanket , and the temperatures dipped down to fifteen degrees . Schools , work places , even the malls were closed . I love snow days %151 ; no stress , no schedules , no homework . On that cold December day , I had n't even gotten out of bed yet . I was cuddled under tons of blankets , reading a book I had checked out of the library . The phone rang and I waited till the fourth or fifth ring to pick it up . " Hello . " I heard a male voice clear his throat . " May I speak to Keisha please ? " " Speaking . " " This is Jonathan Hathaway . I hope I 'm not disturbing you . " I was mildly surprised that he was calling me . I had kept my distance during cross-country practice , and though I sensed that he was interested in me , he rarely said anything to me that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was pleasant when I was around , and he went out of his way to say hello when I saw him in the halls at school . That was cool with me . " No , I was just reading and enjoying this snowy day , " I told him . " Well , that 's why I called , sort of . " He hesitated . " I 'm taking some students skiing this afternoon %151 ; mostly seniors and a couple of kids from the cross-country team . Just for a couple of hours up at Perfect North Slopes . Would you like to go ? " I was truly surprised . I thought about my warm bed and my good book and started to turn him down , but I loved skiing and did n't often get the chance . " Sure , why not ? Sounds like fun . " I could hear him sigh with relief . " I 'll pick you up in an hour if that 's OK . " He hung up and I dragged myself out of bed to find my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work , told her where I was going , and after listening to her warn me about frostbite and windburn , I fixed myself a cup of hot chocolate and got dressed . As I dug in my bottom drawer for my left glove , I called Rhonda , but there was no answer . So I called Jalani . " What 's up , girlfriend ? " Jalani said . " Not much . For sure not the temperature . I must be crazy to think about getting out of my nice warm bed out into that freezing wet stuff outside . " " So what 's making you go ? " " Jonathan Hathaway called . He 's taking some kids from school up to Perfect North Slopes to ski . I told him I 'd go . " I think I sounded as if I was having second thoughts . " What 's wrong with that ? Beside the fact that you 're gon na freeze your buns off , why not go ? It 's not like a date , you know . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensively . I do n't know why that bothered me , but it did . " You know he 's got a thing for you , " Jalani teased . " I know somehow he always seems to be around . But he does seem nice , " I admitted . " And he is so fine ! " Jalani reminded me . " That has nothing to do with it . I 'm going to make him stop by and pick up Monty also . Monty likes hanging around us , and he needs to laugh and have a little fun . " " So you 're going out with Jonathan to help Monty . " " I am not going out with Jonathan ! " I yelled into the phone . " He 's just the driver . " " Sure , Keisha . Have fun . " Jalani chuckled on the other end of the line . " I 'm going over to Gerald 's to see how Angel is doing . Call me when you get home . " Jonathan arrived , eyes bright with excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked me carefully over the ice and slippery snow to the driveway where Rhonda and Tyrone and B. J. , along with Leon and Marcus from the team , sat waiting in the back of Jon-athan 's roomy Jeep Cherokee wagon . Jonathan wore a sky-blue down ski jacket with matching ski pants and hat , looking just like a model out of GQ , dressed for successful skiing , while the others wore an assortment of school jackets and probably a couple pairs of jeans . He checked the angle of his cap in the rear view mirror , adjusted it slightly , then pulled off into the snowy afternoon . " I did n't know you guys were going , " I said cheerfully . " We did n't either , " B. J. replied . " It just sounded like fun . " " Hey , Leon , good to see you ! What 's up ? " I said casually . " Chillin ' ! " Leon replied with a grin . Everyone laughed , especially since it was so cold outside . Leon reached into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This must be why my hands are so cold ! " " Leon , you 're crazy ! " I shouted . " Get that thing out of here ! " Leon replied with a grin , " As you wish , my lady ! " He rolled the window down all the way , while everyone inside the car yelled at him for letting in that blast of freezing air , and tossed the snowball onto the road . I just shook my head , laughing and marveling at the silliness of high school boys . " I tried to call you , Rhonda , but now I know why I got your mom 's machine , " I told her . " B. J. called and told me that instead of sitting through another boring physics lecture , we could experience it first hand ! " Rhonda explained . " The bell would be ringing right now , " B. J. reminded them . " And we would all lean over and get out our notebooks , " I began , thankful we were sitting in a Jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to talk , " Rhonda continued . " He 'd turn on the overhead projector , " B. J. said . " He 'd dim the lights , " Leon added . " Our eyes would glaze over , " I said , as if in that trance . " And Mr. Simpson would drone on about slopes and angles , " Rhonda continued , giggling . " And that would be just the first five minutes of class ! " B. J. laughed triumphantly . " Then Leon would walk in , " I reminded them . " Late , as usual , " Tyrone added . " Without his homework ! " Rhonda continued . " But with the best excuses in the world ! " I added , laughing . " What was that long one you gave Mr. Boston last year ? " " I do n't have my homework because I left it in my dad 's truck , " Leon started to say . " ' So bring it tomorrow , ' the teacher says , " B. J. continued , laughing as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , ' I ca n't bring it tomorrow . ' " Leon loved to drag a story out . " ' And why not ? ' old Boston says , with his high-water pants , bad teeth , and bad breath , " B. J. added , continuing the suspense . " Well , my dad is a long-distance truck driver , sir , " Leon said , " and he 's on his way to California ! And he wo n't be back for three weeks ! So I 'll give you my homework next month ! It 's not my fault ! " Everyone in the car cracked up . It felt good to laugh . " Did you call Gerald ? " I asked Rhonda . " Gerald wanted to stay home with Angel . She 's really doing lots better , " Rhonda reported happily . " And lately , Jalani stays pretty close to wherever Gerald happens to be . " I grinned . " I just talked to Jalani . That 's where she was headed . I 'm glad for them . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Leon had become unusually quiet . B. J. added , " We 've got one more stop . I thought it would be nice to ask Joyelle . With Angel sick , Joyelle is really lonely . " " That 's nice of you , B. J. , " I told him . We pulled into Joyelle 's driveway , and she waddled out to the car . Her mother had made her put on so many clothes , she could hardly walk . She climbed in the back and began to remove scarves and gloves and extra jackets , as everybody laughed . Joyelle knew better than to complain %151 ; her mother was extra sensitive to her daughter 's health and safety since she had lost Rob . " What about Monty ? " I asked Jonathan . " Can we take one more ? " " Sure , " he replied easily . " Use my cell phone and call his house . " Monty , of course , was thrilled . He met the car in the driveway ; his mother waved from the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. J. I was conscious of my leg touching Jonathan 's , but I could n't squeeze very far away in the crowded car . The roads were surprisingly clear , for the salt trucks had been out all night . The sky was a vivid blue , and the snow-covered trees looked bright and shiny in the sunlight . We pulled up to the lodge , piled out , and paid our fees and rented skis . Jonathan , of course , had his own skis , sleek and glossy in a custom case . As he reached down to snap them , I noticed that something tiny and metallic clinked to the tiled floor beneath his boots . Now I 'm a good skier , but this was my first time this winter , so I started on the gentler slopes . The air bit my face like tiny knives . I hated to admit it , but my mother , as usual , was right . I took Monty down a small hill , called Little Bluff , and even though it was his first time on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The expression on his face as he reached the bottom of the hill was worth the effort of getting him ready to do it . He was exultant . " Let 's do it again ! " he cried . So we took the lift back up . That 's when B. J. offered to take him down another , bigger hill , so Monty left me in an instant , excitedly following B. J. I smiled as I watched him go . It was good to see him happy . I saw Leon in the distance , and noticed he was heading my way , but just then , Jonathan skillfully skied over to where I stood . " Race you down ! " he challenged , and I forgot all about Leon for the moment . " You 're on ! " I answered Jonathan as I took off . He barely had time to put on his goggles before I had left him in a swirl of snow . He laughed as he took off behind me , easily catching and passing me . " Good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have left you like yesterday 's snowman . " " Are you ready for Deception Hill ? " he asked . " I dare you to try . " I hesitated . Deception was steep and curved , and considered one of the most difficult hills on the slopes . " I tell you what , " I offered , " instead of racing , let 's just try skiing . I do n't think I 'm ready for racing on Deception yet . " " Good idea , " he agreed . We skied together toward the chair lift that would take us to Deception , sliding easily in unison . I found on the ride that Jonathan was easy to talk to , and seemed to have been everywhere and done everything . He had skied in Switzerland , had taken hot-air balloon rides in Kenya , and had even been scuba diving in Australia . I chatted to him about my plans for medical school , my hopes of learning to fly a plane , and my worries about college . When the lift dropped us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was breathtaking . It looked like one of those paint-by-number pictures that I used to do when I was ten years old . Bright , clean snow covered the world %151 ; it looked like tons of spilled sugar . The pine trees decorated the scene with green . I breathed deeply of the cold , fresh air . It was the first time in several months that I had felt truly free . " Thank you , " I said suddenly to Jonathan . " For what ? " he answered in surprise . " For making me get out of bed . For talking to me like I 'm a person , not a kid . For bringing me to this beautiful place . " I was silent for a moment . " I know we teased you that night at the library , but there really is a big difference between you and the high school boys I 've known since kindergarten . I 've never had a conversation like we just had . It was refreshing %151 ; just like this wind . " Jonathan grinned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe that 's why the boys your age do n't appeal to you . " " One of them did , " I replied quietly . " But he 's gone . " " I 've heard all about Andy , " Jonathan said carefully . " I 'm really sorry , Keisha . " " Can we take the lift back down , Jonathan ? I think I 'd rather just talk a little more than try to prove to you I 'm bad enough to try Deception . Besides , I 'm cold . " " I was just going to suggest that . Let 's find the others and head back home . Monty is probably an icicle by now . " I laughed as we got back in the lift . Deception could wait . " Keisha , " Jonathan said to me when we got back to the bottom of the hill , " I really enjoyed today . Would you like to go to the movies some time ? If you think it 's not appropriate , just let me know . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I think I 'd like that . " He smiled with delight , but said nothing more as the others started to head toward us . We gathered the rest of the group and headed back to Jonathan 's wagon , tired and cold , but feeling really mellow . Monty fell asleep as soon as the car heater warmed up . The rest talked quietly about the hills and the spills of the day . Rhonda snuggled close to Tyrone . Joyelle nodded on Tyrone 's other shoulder . B. J. glanced back at her and smiled . Leon looked quietly out of the window , watching the snow . Jonathan glanced at himself briefly in the rear view mirror , turned on a smooth jazz station , and we headed back to Cincinnati to the mellow sounds of the saxophone . For the first time in months , I felt like the rock where my feelings used to be was starting to dissolve . The snow had started to fall again .                @ @ @ @ @
