<p> Those Yanks of World War II are white-haired now . Greatgrand children play about their feet . The grand parades and great commemorations are over . Only a few monuments to their achievements are yet to be built . But we can still see them as they were , striking the casual pose , caps and helmets tilted toward the big adventure , cigarettes dangling from a smile . The picture is all innocence . And then later : the hours and days of fatigue piled one on top of the other , " for the duration , " eyes that have seen too much and will see more , bandages and blankets on the bloody cots , empty helmets , the wreckage of faith . We can see them like this too , and all in between , in the high councils of state and command , on the high seas and miles above , and in holes that turn into graves in an instant . In all the time since the Yanks were young , you see , history has been erecting its own monuments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly recorded and studied war in all military history . By now we might think our picture of the war is almost finished . Far from it . History never stops rearranging itself . But every modern war has created its own historical and literary reflection , a blurred image that gradually passes through stages , growing sharper each year . Just after the last shot come the hot-off-the-press first drafts of history . Memoirs and novels march out next , followed soon enough by stories of the war 's bestknown events , battles , personalities , and policies . Only much later do the grand histories appear , seasoned by years of study , broad of scope and learning . Inevitably , however , revisions and counter-interpretations will challenge conventional wisdom to defend itself . Controversies great and small will compete for our opinions . Eventually the war 's reflection assumes a familiar , mature form , perhaps stable for a time before the reinterpretations begin anew . <p> If the literature of World War II has indeed reached such a place , one might think it simple to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depends on what one expects from such a list . Those who think proportionality is more important than perspective , for instance , might like a list that represents the war by military service , with equal parts for the Army , Navy , Marines , Air Corps , Merchant Marine , and Coast Guard , not to mention the WAVES and WACS . They would quickly find themselves overwhelmed with books but no idea of how to make sense of the part the services contributed to the whole war . The same would be true if one were organizing a list around the weapons used . One might learn everything about armored warfare without knowing much of anything about the war in which it was used . That would be putting the tank before the horse , and as we all know , many more horses fought in World War II than tanks . All this is why I have made this list as though it were for me , many years ago , when I knew less than nothing about the war but wanted to learn . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have known more , sooner and more systematically , than I did . They have added immeasurably to my understanding of this most important of modern wars . <p> I think the key to reading about America 's part in the war , and thus America 's role in it , is to realize that America 's was not the only part - a salient fact all too often glossed over in literature and film ever since . This means that one must begin learning about America 's part by seeing the war as a whole , in its vast scope and in its unending complexity . The book that best captures the war 's totality is Gerhard L. Weinberg 's monumental global history A World at Arms : A Global History of World War II ( 1994 ; Cambridge ) , which draws upon the wealth of archival and historical work that has appeared since the war and fuses the whole into an intelligible historical picture of that cataclysmic era . No one , scholars included , should presume to know about the Second World War if they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-century 's remove from the war , it is useful to remind ourselves that the Allied victory was not preordained . The Allies could have lost . No Olympian judge sat with history book on lap , dictating the war develop in this way or that . So , how were the Axis powers defeated ? Richard Overy , for one , will not accept the casual , fashionable notion of recent years that the Axis lost the war and that the Allies simply enjoyed the results of their enemy 's mistakes . Overy 's analytical history , Why the Allies Won ( 1995 ; Norton ) , explains how the Allies won a victory that was far from inevitable . " The Allies did not have victory handed to them on a plate , " he writes ; " they had to fight for it . " <p> And it is the fighting - or more exactly the human beings doing the fighting - that most interest Paul Fussell in Wartime : Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War ( 1989 ; Oxford ) , a thoroughly bad-tempered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional culture " produced by the war . Fussell 's war was not the war the statesmen or the generals or even the 90-day wonders wanted to contemplate , but the real war that belonged to Fussell and his comrades . As an angry infantryman turned distinguished professor of literature , Fussell is most interested in the war 's " actuality , " the war that will " never get in the books . " He writes that " for the past fifty years , the Allied war has been sanitized and romanticized almost beyond recognition . I have tried to balance the scales . " When you read Wartime , turn your Norman Rockwell print toward the wall . <p> Well before Pearl Harbor , American strategists had decided that in the event of a two-front war against Germany and Japan , the defeat of Germany would be America 's primary strategic objective . But for nearly the first half of the war , America 's fight against Japan took center stage . The war across the Pacific was a part of a struggle so different it could almost be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest and most complex of all the operational theaters , requiring unprecedented , novel combinations of ground , air , and naval force , directed inventively against a skilled , desperate enemy . Some strategists at the time argued that the Pacific war was so important it should be America 's only war . For all that , the Pacific campaign is still less well represented by history than the one in Europe . By seeing this particular war through the expert and comprehensive analysis in Ronald H. Specter 's Eagle Against the Sun : The American War With Japan ( 1985 ; Vintage ) , readers can begin to appreciate not only how it was fought but just how critical it was to the outcome of the whole war . <p> One of the defining features of the Pacific war was the bitter racism that suffused both sides ' conduct in the war . No corner of Allied or Japanese strategy , campaigns , operations , or minor tactics was beyond the reach of racism 's poisonous effect . John W. Dower 's prizewinning War Without Mercy : Race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is the most thoroughly researched and balanced investigation into the sources of the Pacific war 's viciousness . No one should journey into this region of the war without Dower 's guiding hand . <p> For every one of the combatant nations in this war , some single campaign , battle , or event has assumed a symbolic power that outshines all others . For Americans , the D-day invasion of Normandy on June 6 , 1944 , is the iconic battle of the war . That is partly why the Normandy campaign has attracted so many able historians and inspired so many memoirists over the years . Carlo D'Este 's Decision in Normandy ( 1983 ; William S. Konecky Assoc. ) , however , portrays the war from the vantage point of those who bore the responsibility of conceiving , planning , and executing the D-day campaign - a campaign that took the Allies to victory as no other operation could have done . After spending time with Decision in Normandy , the reader will have an idea of how the professionals plan and command modern war . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the shooting starts . The greatest challenge for any student of any war is to come to an understanding of the world of combat , for combat alone is the essence of war . Without the threat of combat , the dread of it , the act of it , or the sorrow of it , war itself would collapse . War has never held out the secrets of combat for historians to see . This best-studied of all wars has produced very few histories that come directly to grips with war 's fundamental nature . It is true , as it has long been true , that fiction and the literature of memory deal with the act of combat more effectively than any other forms of literature . <p> History will have to go some way , therefore , to equal Eugene B. Sledge 's classic memoir of his war in the Pacific , With the Old Breed : At Peleliu and Okinawa ( 1981 ; Oxford ) . Fighting with the 1st Marine Division in 1944 and 1945 , Sledge 's company suffered 64 percent casualties during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fighting was worse . Only much later was Sledge able to reflect on what he had seen and done and lost during his war . An understanding of war is impossible without an understanding of combat ; the reader is advised to pay attention to the lessons Sledge and his friends paid such a high price to learn . <p> Sledge 's book has been justly praised since its first appearance . A much less well-known memoir depicts the vastly different experience of combat miles above the earth at the controls of a heavy bomber . John Muirhead fought with the 301st Bomb Group , first out of North Africa and then out of Italy , against Axis targets , one of which was Romania 's infamous Ploesti oil field . Like Sledge , Muirhead returned to a quiet life after the war and did not sit down to his memoirs until much later , finally publishing Those Who Fall in 1986 ( Random House ; out of print ) . No American heavy bomber pilot had ever before published an account of his wartime experiences . Military memoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muirhead 's book is distinguished by a style so fine the reader finds himself wishing the writer had made a life in letters . When these qualities are combined with his authoritative rendering of the Allied bomber offensive from the pilot 's perspective , Those Who Fall must take its place on the shelf alongside Sledge 's With the Old Breed as one of the two best memoirs of the Second World War . <p> Those Who Fall will eventually find the wider audience it deserves . Norman Mailer 's World War II novel , The Naked and the Dead ( Picador ) , found its wider audience as soon as it was published , in 1948 . Drafted less than a year after graduating from Harvard , Mailer spent the last two years of the war as an enlisted man in the Army . His experiences as a rifleman in the Philippines inspired him to begin writing . The Naked and the Dead was published two years after he returned home . His dark rendition of the war from the conflicting perspectives of command and soldier defied the triumphal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instant histories . Remarkably , a war-weary American public kept Mailer 's book at the top of the bestseller lists for 11 weeks . The work has had many imitators since , but The Naked and the Dead still stands at the top of the list of novels produced by the Second World War . <p> Despite their different ambitions , all these writers hold fast , unflinchingly , to the fundamental human nature of war . Each of these books in its own way shows the reader how war calls forth the best and the most terrible human qualities . That is why the last title on this shelf of World War II books may be the most important . Richard Rhodes 's The Making of the Atomic Bomb ( 1986 ; Simon &; Schuster ) is an exquisitely rendered history of the most terrible of all weapons from its theoretical beginnings to its first use at Hiroshima and Nagasaki . The war made the bomb , and for the next generation the world struggled to control what the war had made . The Making of the Atomic Bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also tilts its head in the direction of the future . That is where all the best history should aim . Armed with these books , and the wisdom they contain , we may see a future in which the term world war belongs to an ever-receding past . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Operation Soapsuds ( the Ploesti raid ) , by Nixon Galloway , 1969 . <p> By Roger J.
