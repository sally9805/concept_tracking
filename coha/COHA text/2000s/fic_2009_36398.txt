If my radio alarm had gone off , I would have known the president was dead . But we had lost power from the thunderstorm that still raged when I woke up to the beep of my backup alarm , my Ironman watch . I got up and did n't even bother to look out the window . I liked running in the rain , but not in a storm . I shaved in the dim bathroom while the rain pounded the roof . I listened to Debbie running around trying to get the kids ready for school in the dark . They ate cold cereal with warm milk and whined about how horrible everything was . <p> <p> It was the worst storm I could remember since moving to Annapolis . My commute was n't far , but the storm turned it into a complete nightmare . I sometimes wonder why I even bother . I have high-speed Internet at home that connects me to my office just as if I were sitting at my desk . But I actually like having an office . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suit and drive to the office . It feels wrong to sit in my pajamas talking on the phone with a U.S. attorney in D.C. , sounding tough about a criminal he 's trying to put away . Probably my Marine training . I spent too much of my lost youth deriving comfort from mindless routine . <p> <p> I drove through the downpour ignorant of the enormity of events that swirled around me . Everyone in the world knew about the crash except me . I sometimes listen to the news while driving , but I had become addicted to books on tape . That day I was deep into a John le CarrT novel , which , when I started the engine in my Volvo XC90 , picked up right where it had left off . <p> <p> I got to my office a little later than usual and parked in my space in front of our two-story redbrick building . As far as I knew , it was just another day , with the Big Storm to remember it by . I opened the heavy door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put my umbrella in the brass stand near the door and shook the rain off my raincoat . <p> <p> " Morning , " I said to Dolores , our fiftysomething receptionist , who was well-intentioned but did n't really get it . <p> <p> She had an odd look on her face . " Good morning , Mr. Nolan , " she said , pregnant with expectation . <p> <p> " How are you , Dolores ? " I hung my coat on a peg on the coatrack and picked up my briefcase , waiting for the storm questions . Dolores was waiting for something else . " What ? " I asked . <p> <p> " Can you believe the news ? " <p> <p> I quickly realized I had n't heard any news . " What news ? " <p> <p> " You have n't heard ? " <p> <p> " Heard what ? " <p> <p> " About the president . " <p> <p> The last time anyone had spoken to me like that about the president was when Reagan was shot by Hinckley and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> <p> " I thought you must have heard . " <p> <p> " Power went off . " <p> <p> " I thought you 'd listen in your car . " <p> <p> " What is it , Dolores ? " <p> <p> " The president 's helicopter went down last night . " <p> <p> I felt a sudden dryness in my throat . " Was he in it ? " I asked , afraid of what the answer was . I 'm not , or I should say was n't , a fan of the president 's . Different parties , different perspectives on pretty much everything . But the idea of the president dying was about the office of the president , the disruption , not the end of a politician I did n't care for . <p> <p> " Yes . On his way to Camp David in the middle of that storm . " <p> <p> " Why the hell was he flying last night ? That was nuts . " <p> <p> " That 's what everybody 's asking . Nobody 's answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee room ? " <p> <p> " Yes , sir . " She frowned . <p> <p> I started toward the back of the office thinking about what kind of storm it would take to cause the president 's helicopter to go down . Last night 's storm was just the kind . Lots of wind , electrical storm , nasty rain , hail , maybe even icing . Lots of possibilities . " Anybody get out ? " I yelled over my shoulder . <p> <p> " No , sir . All killed . Pi lots , Secret Ser vice agents , president , everybody . " <p> <p> I shook my head . " Vice president been on television yet ? " <p> <p> " Just for a second  --  looked like he 'd seen a ghost . He 's being sworn in at ten . Mr. Nolan ? " she said , forcing me to stop . <p> <p> " What ? " I said , stopping . <p> <p> " There 's something else . " <p> <p> " What ? " <p> <p> " Kathryn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of Aviation Insurers International , or AII as it was known , A-double-I . She was one of the people who retained me in cases , who made it possible for my children to eat more than saltines . A lot of what I did was to defend airplane manufacturers in lawsuits when planes crashed , especially helicopters  --  which I flew , and still did , in the Marine Reserves  --  and which , coincidentally , crash more than fixed-wing airplanes . In the Marine Corps , we said our helicopters were sixty thousand parts flying in formation , yearning to be free of each other . Sometimes that was more accurate than we liked to admit . <p> <p> AII probably insured either the helicopter or one of the major parts in it , and they were concerned . " She say what she wanted ? " I asked . <p> <p> " Just that it was about Marine One . " <p> <p> Everybody from our small firm except Dolores was crammed into the squeaky-floored coffee room . A small , round table sat in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built-in videocassette player was in the corner on the counter . " Morning , " I said to the group . <p> <p> They all responded without looking at me . They were riveted to the live images of the crash scene . News helicopters battled each other in the rain overhead the crash site for the best angles to show the wreckage ; several had their cameramen hanging out of the doors to zoom in better on the scene . One cameraman was standing on the skid of his helicopter , held on by a rock-climbing harness . They were about to make more wreckage if they were n't careful . <p> <p> My law partner , Rick Berberian , said , " You lose power ? " <p> <p> " Yeah . All night . You ? " <p> <p> " Pretty much the whole western part of the city . " <p> <p> Two of our three associates were sitting in chairs , leaning forward . If the mood were n't so serious , it would have been comical . Rachel Long , the third associate  --  who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her arms crossed . She was also a Naval Academy graduate , surface warfare , who had resigned from the navy after a crushing divorce from a classmate . With her gaze fixed on the television , she said , " You hear Kathryn called ? " <p> <p> " Yeah . " I nodded and stared at the video images of the crash scene that were being shown over and over as a variety of people spoke over the images . The wreckage still burned in the ravine . You could make out the skeleton of a helicopter and the path of destruction where it had ripped through the trees . There was no trench in the ground or the trees . Marine One had come straight down . <p> <p> A large , dark green tarp covered a large portion of the wreckage site . I could n't figure out how or why they had erected a tarp , then remembered the news helicopters . A lot of sensitive evidence could be on the ground . Like bodies . Like the president 's charred body . Not something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> Rachel asked , " Think we 'll get a case from this ? " Rachel worked with me both on the criminal defense work I did , and aviation cases . She had n't been a pi lot when she started with me four years before , but had gotten her private pilot 's license within a year . She loved it and was working toward her commercial license . <p> <p> " Probably thinking about the security clearances . Lots of French workers did n't have the clearances the people at Sikorsky had . Remember all that yelling from Congress ? They said if the contract for the new Marine One helicopter went to a French company , it would expose the president to assassination by helicopter . They picked the French company anyway . They 're probably scared shitless right now . " <p> <p> Rachel stood up . " Maybe they did just kill the president . " <p> <p> " Well , maybe they 're about to be our client , so do n't jump to any conclusions . What do we know so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , pushed her black hair behind her ear , and said , " Departed the South Lawn around ten pm heading to Camp David . Secret Ser vice wanted to drive , president wanted to fly . Marine pi lot okayed the flight . Apparently he had a ton  --  " <p> <p> " What was his name ? " <p> <p> " Chuck Collins . " They all looked at me . " You know him ? " <p> <p> I knew him all right . Not personally as much as by reputation . Everyone in Marine helicopters , even in the reserves , was shocked when he was selected as the commanding officer of HMX-1 to fly the president . There had been a stunned silence in the Corps . We could n't imagine how a pi lot who was widely known to despise the president had become his chief pi lot . Most had shrugged and put it down as one of the many ironies of life . Others had simply waited for something dramatic to happen , which they thought was inevitable . But what most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fraud or a philanderer and Collins being fired in disgrace . Rachel broke my train of thought . " So , do you ? " <p> <p> " Know him ? Yeah , sort of . Not very well . Reputation mostly . Without a doubt , one of the best pi lots in the Corps . " He could fly anything . He 'd flown F/A-18s , then transferred to helicopters . Nobody did that , but he did . He wanted to work with the grunts , get shot at and shoot back instead of dropping bombs . He had supposedly said he wanted to " watch ' em die " when he was in combat . None of this **51;1885;TOOLONG existence for him . What a piece of work . But a great pi lot . Several combat tours , highly decorated , brave , heroic even . But how had he become the president 's pi lot ? Had the interviewers been so dazzled they did n't see what he was like ? We had all wondered , but had frankly forgotten about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude a couple of times looking for clear air . Kept moving around . Last transmission to ATC said he was out of control . " <p> <p> " They interviewed the controller ? " " Yeah , and they 've already recovered the FDR , even though it 's pretty burned . They 've taken it back to D.C. " <p> <p> I felt stupid . If you 'd asked me whether Marine One had a flight data recorder , I would n't have known . Airliners all have them , but most other planes do n't . It made sense that they 'd put one in Marine One , particularly the new model . " What about the CVR ? " The cockpit voice recorder , a hard drive that recorded everything the pi lots or crew said . <p> <p> " Still looking for it . " <p> <p> " What 's everyone saying happened ? " I asked . <p> <p> Rachel leaned back slightly . " First on was that senator from Mississippi  --  " <p> <p> " Blankenship , " Berberian said . <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said exactly what you just said . " Rachel imitated Blankenship 's voice : " ' I hate to say I told you so , but I said if we picked this foreign company to build Marine One , admittedly with an American company as the front , that there could be trouble . I 'm now told we never even completed the security clearances of the European workers before this helicopter was delivered . Now it 's come to this . I 'm calling for a full investigation into the construction and security of the helicopter , particularly the parts made overseas . ' " <p> <p> Rachel said , " He said if it was n't intentional , then it was a defective helicopter , and that 's almost as bad . So he got two I told you so 's , which clearly pleased him . Then there were the usual experts . One former NTSB investigator said it was almost certainly the weather . " The NTSB was the National Transportation Safety Board . They were responsible for investigating all major crashes in the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators , one of whom was in charge of any investigation . Those investigators would often retire and go into private consulting work doing the same thing for private parties for a lot more money . <p> <p> " Pretty good guess . " <p> <p> " Not if you listen to the other former NTSB investigator . He said this helicopter could handle that weather no problem . Would n't be comfortable , but would n't cause it to crash , and they were too high for a wind shear to knock them down . " <p> <p> " That 's also true . What else ? " I asked . <p> <p> " Then there was the former helicopter pi lot with a million flight hours who suspects foul play . Said these Marine One pi lots are the best helicopter pi lots in the world flying the strongest and best helicopter in the world . Would n't be maintenance , not with the way they take care of Marine One . He said it was either a missile or a midair by another plane that was n't squawking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> <p> I answered , " Had their transponder turned off so Washington control could n't see them on their radars , at least not easily . Might be the only way you could get another airplane close to the president in the air . " I watched the video on the screen zoom in on a large rotor blade that was close to the rest of the wreckage . It was nearly intact . " It 'd be pretty hard to shoot down a helicopter in the dark through a thunderstorm . Could be done with radar and fire control , but it would n't be easy . And I promise you not by some random guy with a Stinger in his trunk . " <p> <p> " Marine One have antimissile defenses ? " <p> <p> " Sure , " I answered . <p> <p> " What sort ? " <p> <p> " You 're not cleared for that . " <p> <p> Berberian laughed . " You do n't know , do you ? " <p> <p> I looked over his way . " Actually I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> He was puzzled . " Why the hell not ? " <p> <p> " Because I fly that helicopter every month , Rick . I know the Secret Supplement . " <p> <p> " The what ? " <p> <p> " The book that describes all the classified equipment . " <p> <p> Berberian was n't persuaded . He wanted the inside scoop and was pissed I would n't give it to him . <p> <p> Rachel poured another cup of coffee and headed toward the door while I watched the political commentators in front of the White House discussing the swearing in of the vice president , Donald Cunningham , the former senator from Illinois . " Shall we call Kathryn ? " she asked . <p> <p> " We ? " <p> <p> " Are n't I going to be involved ? " Rachel asked . <p> <p> " In the case , or investigation , what ever it is , probably ; but not the phone call . I 'm not going to make this call on a speakerphone . " <p> <p> Rachel was disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had grown accustomed to as a navy officer . " I 'll let you know what she says . " <p> <p> I walked up the stairs to my office . Rachel was right behind me . Her office was next to mine . I turned on my computer , checked a few news Web sites , and glanced at my e-mails . Dozens of e-mails from other Marine pi lots in the reserves , most wanting everyone else 's take on the accident . I could answer those later . I picked up the phone and dialed Kathryn 's number . <p> <p> Excerpted from MARINE ONE by JAMES W. HUSTON Copyright 2009 by JAMES W.
