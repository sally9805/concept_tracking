HS ( HS AND CAMERON TURN AND SEE JAMES . ) Anywhere but where I 'm from . JAMES My name is James . HS HS and Cameron . JAMES I 'm from Missouri on my way north to the Boundary Waters . CAMERON We 're headed south to Deer River . ( SHE TRIES TO PULL HS PAST JAMES . ) JAMES Just keep making my way north . Staying where I can . You see a clump of trees on the open land . It 's so overgrown you think there 's nothing in it , but there 's an abandoned house you share with the animals and snakes . In the night you hear them come and go . That 's when they 're open for business . For once you fit in . HS We been up north to Red Lake . Leech Lake Portage . Turtle Mound between Bowstring and Winnibigoshish Lakes . p. 3 CAMERON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campers . HS Once in a while , an Indian wrapped in a bear skin . CAMERON Let 's go , HS .

HS I thought you 'd be relieved  --  CAMERON Stay with me , HS . JAMES I saw you ride up in your cycle with its sidecar . I rode that way once . I remember seeing a hawk hold out it wings and ride the updraft of air . HS I wore a cape once . Held out my arms and went nowhere . CAMERON My father drove his truck into the porch of the white farmhouse we rented . He backed up and rammed it again  --  as long as the truck would run . Where did his fury come from ? I 'm dying for you , he said as if his truck was a cross . He was arrested and we got the letter saying he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were sent to the Boarding School in Cloquet .

Right there in the Bible . David wrote it . p. 4 CAMERON HS is King David of the Highway . JAMES What if you did n't memorize the verses ? HS We memorized whatever they said . Otherwise we did n't get dinner . JAMES What does HS stand for ? HS Those Bible verses come in the night . Hoards of them . Fiery dogs from the outer darkness . JAMES I hear those dogs when I stay in abandoned houses without doors and windows , the glass all broken on the floor . CAMERON His name is Herbert Stuart . JAMES ( NODDING . ) HS . CAMERON I see the moon is a skull when I sleep under the sky . HS After my father left us , we heard he was beheaded in an accident . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back . That 's all we know for sure . They pierced his hands and feet . David wrote that in Psalm 22 before Christ was born . How did David know ? It was foreknowledge . Knowing something before it happened . Only he did n't know what it was that would happen , but he wrote about it because there was a hand over his hand writing it  --  a large hand came down and moved David 's hand . It did n't make sense yet , but it would . p. 5 JAMES Do you read the Bible too , Cameron ? CAMERON I wait tables in Deer River . That 's where we 're headed . We 're going the wrong way for the Boundary Waters . JAMES Maybe not . CAMERON HS is a road man . By that I mean someone who has to drive the open road . The only time we stop is for gas and the night . I cry from loneliness . JAMES Who does n't ?

The books , the clothes , the necessities . I arrange them in my backpack . CAMERON You get all that in a backpack ? JAMES That 's why it takes me since February . I made things disappear in my backpack and reappear when I need them . HS Wherever there 's a church with all the windpipes of the spirit open . CAMERON In the woods , HS preaches to the deer , the wolves , the racoons , the moose , the owl . Little campfires burn where he preaches . You can smell the little fires where he 's been . On the lake , he preaches to the loons and ducks . p. 6 HS I rivet the scriptures to my head . Wear them under my headband . I see the Most High risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidecar .

Cameron understands my mission . CAMERON He 's my star man , my red man , my highway man . HS You want to be anywhere but here . I 'm a prophet from outer space . I bring revelation . Ezekiel saw the heavens opened . He saw dudes with four faces and four wing . He saw hooves on their feet . Cameron brings me back from my visions . Sometimes I see them at gas stations , bus stations , cafes . Sometimes I 'm somewhere and I hear one has just been there . Sometimes we pass on the road  --  or meet at abandoned houses . Nothing better than spending the night with another like yourself . It 's hard to draw away . It 's like tearing off your skin . JAMES How do you know we just met ? CAMERON My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would too  --  HS No , you wouldn't. p. 7 CAMERON My brother had dreams that shook the room . He thought my father was still ramming the house . HS Sometimes I see my father 's head flying over me like an owl . You ca n't outrun it , Cameron . Whatever it is , it will catch you . You ca n't go faster than it can . You 're like a little sparrow in the wind . You think you 've got wings and you do , but they 're nothing like the wings you need out there on the road . Sometimes you think it 's just wind that blows you from one side to another , and you 're in the ditch before you know one of those dudes just passed over . It had wheels , and eyes all over its head . We 're never sure what passes  --  Maybe those living creatures like coals of fire . The light goes up and down them like northern lights .

SOON SHE PUSHES BACK FROM HS . ) CAMERON HS carries Bible verses in his pouch . He has a tattoo on his thigh : Cloquet Boarding School . You going to ride off with your wings drawn ? Your red eyes lit ? Where you from , James ? p. 9 JAMES I flew on my wings . CAMERON You could n't take him away if you had n't . I was hoping you 'd dematerialize like the stuff in your backpack . What 's the name of the reformatory where you work , James ? JAMES Missouri State Reformatory for Boys . CAMERON Where is it ? JAMES Warrensburg , Missouri . CAMERON How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days .

You did n't find him in your reform school ? JAMES Our boys are from Missouri . CAMERON I lost track of him . We remembered too much when we were together . He 's probably in the other world . p. 10 JAMES What makes you think that ? CAMERON He was already stiff as silverware . HS Cameron stabs you with her prongs . No regrets he 's gone . No , we 're together until death separates us . CAMERON I 'm going to be with HS until he 's gone  --  with many regrets he 's gone . HS Could we speak without a storm ? Could we speak without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The walls are all there . CAMERON If we stop arguing , you 'd be gone . HS You think our arguments hold us together ?

CAMERON That 's what I 'd give you , James . ( TO HS ) Let 's go . It 's only raining now and then . HS ( INDICATING CAMERON ) Intermittent . JAMES I 'll show up ahead of you again . p. 11 CAMERON Who are you ? JAMES A voice in the wilderness . An Indian wrapped in a bear skin . CAMERON Did someone call you from the outer world ? JAMES You think your father hated you ? Maybe he 's been at your side . CAMERON HS is at my side . JAMES What if I 'm the part of you out there howling ? You think no one picks up ? CAMERON You 're a spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ? HS Holy is the word for a time like this . I am Ezekiel looking into heaven . I become the verses they made me memorize . It 's my revenge . CAMERON I 've been Delilah for HS . The Queen of Sheba . Bath-sheba . I become someone in the Bible for him . I pull him back from the edge of heaven . JAMES It 's the smell of cedar and northern pines that pulls me . CAMERON Wait til the northern lights blow over you . You got the road , James . Why do n't you take it ? All I got is HS . HS Look at that caf across the road in the shape of a fish . ( HS TAKES A SMALL BIBLE FROM THE POCKET OF HIS JEAN JACKET AND READS. ) p. 12 JAMES You can let HS run . He 'll be back . CAMERON Every time he leaves , he comes back farther away . You only want a ride , James . There are n't many like HS . You 're just some wilderness man on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride . JAMES Are you different ? CAMERON It used to be the Cloquet Boarding School HS came back from . Now it 's the wilderness . JAMES What 's your work , HS ? HS I wash dishes at Deer River Caf . I drive a truck . Resort work . Repair motorcycles . I worked on snow mobiles . Maintenance . Clean up . Snow removal . It 's here on the earth I hear the deer . Those leaf eaters . JAMES Why am I in this world ? HS Why do I spill over into the invisible world ? JAMES They lined us up in the orphanage . We marched as children in military order . I reached out to the air . I made my eyes circle until I was dizzy . I would open my mouth wide as I could open it , calling the ceiling to fall in my mouth and suffocate me . CAMERON ( CAMERON LAUNCHES INTO A MONOLOGUE TO TRY AND HOLD HER OWN WITH THE MEN . ) Once long ago , the deer came to eat at the Deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on the menu . The deer were customers . The deer did n't tip . The deer had trouble sitting in the chairs . They hung their jackets on the coat rack . They liked the moose heads and mounted fish . The knotty pine walls . Restrooms marked , Inboard and Outboard . The Deer River Caf music  --  maybe Bob Dylan  --  maybe the polka priest  --  maybe Charlie Mcguire , the singing Minnesota Park Ranger . What we needed was some drums . Some deer songs . Sometimes I hear the deer humming . The trouble with a deer is that you end up as a target . I became invisible when my father rammed the house . I want HS to become my father and back the truck away from the house and tell me he will not ram the house again . My brother and I used to pick the peeling paint off that old farmhouse . Mother ! Where were you ? Frozen with fear ? A mother who did n't protect her children . The sky is falling on the house . Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't walk . He wo n't move . Wo n't bend . He 's a stick boy . He holds himself like a spoon . He becomes a wall to hold back my father 's truck . A fork is a claw on a handle . A fork is a row of teeth . A fork is the branch of a metal tree . A fork is my longing for HS . What 's your order ? p. 13 HS ( LOOKING AT THE CAF ACROSS THE ROAD . ) The Lord told Jonah to go to Nineveh . CAMERON Next it will be someplace he ca n't come back from . If you want a ride to the Boundary Waters , take a bus . JAMES I do n't think a bus goes there . CAMERON Hitch a ride with someone else . Why do n't you have a ride of your own ? What are you running from ? JAMES We 're all running . CAMERON You 'll catch HS in whatever trouble you 're in . JAMES What makes you think I 'm in trouble ? CAMERON Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach all winter . What spirit school you from ? JAMES I pull the boys into school . I reach the outriders . CAMERON What if I see spirits everywhere too , and you 're not one of them I know . HS It 's because you 're haunted by your brother and father . JAMES You 're afraid your father will show up in his truck . You 're afraid HS 's father will show up without his head . p. 14 HS I do n't think I ever saw him with his head . JAMES HS is taking you back to Deer River , Cameron . CAMERON I want him to stay there with me . JAMES Is that up to you ? CAMERON You resent someone telling you what to do . JAMES What happened to your brother ? CAMERON You think you 're the ghost of my brother ? What was his name ? JAMES If I 'm the ghost of anyone 's brother , I 'm the ghost of HS 's . CAMERON You 're no one . Not even a ghost . JAMES Then why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE BIBLE , SEPARATES JAMES AND CAMERON AND TELLS THEM WHAT HE HAS READ . ) The Lord told Jonah to go to Nineveh , but Jonah caught a ship to Tarshish . A storm came up at sea , and the men were afraid . They threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship . They cast lots to find the cause of the storm , and the lot fell to Jonah . The men tried to bring the ship into land , but could not . Jonah told them to throw him over board , and they did . p. 15 CAMERON ( HS HANDS THE BIBLE , OPENED , TO CAMERON , WHO LOOKS AT IT . ) But the Lord made a whale to swallow Jonah . He was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights . HS The waters close over me , the seaweed wraps around my head . JAMES I feel the northern lights already . CAMERON ( CAMERON OPENS HER ARMS AND SWALLOWS HS WITH THEM . SHE SPEAKS TO HS WITH LOVE . ) I am the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am in the bottoms of the mountains . I am in the earth with its bars . CAMERON The Lord spoke to the fish and the fish spit Jonah on the shore . ( SHE RELEASES HS FROM HER HOLD . ) Then Jonah went where he was supposed to go  --  ( CAMERON HANDS THE BIBLE BACK TO HS , BUT JAMES TAKES IT AND LOOKS AT THE STORY OF JONAH . ) HS He went to Nineveh and preached to the city to repent . Then he sat down in the shade of a gourd . The gourd died and the sun beat down on Jonah , and he grieved for the gourd . The Lord said to Jonah , you have more pity for a gourd than for all the people and cattle in Nineveh ? p. 16 JAMES ( JAMES TURNS THE PAGE , BUT FINDS NOTHING FURTHER TO READ . ) The story ends there ? Mid-air ? CAMERON The perils of the open road  --  a whale that 's been turned into a caf and a lightning steak from the sky in this open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( JAMES THUMBS THROUGH THE BIBLE . ) HS I 'll see the Indian wrapped in a bear skin  --  I have to speak to the animals , the woods and the sky . CAMERON You ca n't hold a vision , HS . Your arms go right through it . ( SHE HOLDS ONTO HIM , BUT HE DOES N'T RETURN HER EMBRACE . ) Why are you far from helping me , and from the words of my roaring ? JAMES ( LOOKING UP FROM THE BIBLE . ) What if I am the Indian wrapped in a bear robe ? CAMERON You 're nothing with a form of its own . You have to find whatever shape you can to borrow . You would haunt HS . JAMES What if I am a shape changer ? HS A shape changer can cross the miles without wheels . JAMES How do you think I got here ? p. 17 HS In the sound of a motorcycle , I hear thunder . In the thunder , I hear the spirits . CAMERON What if you look one way to HS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice crying in the wilderness . CAMERON HS is John the Baptist of Highway 6 . There is n't room for you . HS John was an Indian in an animal skin . CAMERON ( TO JAMES ) You 're wearing jeans . You got a dirty t-shirt under your mock-leather jacket . Ride your invisible motorcycle , James . Ride the northern lights . JAMES I do n't have a vehicle . I teach classes in a reformatory . I came from an orphanage . I got no one . In the summers I travel . Getting a ride with who I can . I got my nose to the wind , trying to find where I 'm from . ( JAMES HANDS THE BIBLE TO HS , WHO LOOKS THROUGH IT AGAIN . ) I stop at a pavilion to get out of the rain . I see HS and recognize him as the shape changer I been looking for . He 's been wiped out and put together again . I see he 's transformation itself . What if I can be like him ? CAMERON It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I become one character in the Bible after another . p. 18 CAMERON Go to the spirit world for help , James . Not HS . JAMES What if I want to be with HS , Cameron , for the pleasure of his company ? What if I want to get HS away from you ? What if you 're the shape changer ? The ghost without a form ? What if I want to give HS space ? What if I 'm the spirit he has called to show him the way ? CAMERON If we were spirits , we would n't get wet in the rain . We would n't look like bodiless heads in our sleeping bags under the eyebrows of the stars . JAMES If I was a spirit , I would n't be hungry for the wild rice and northern walleye in that fish-caf over there . CAMERON If you were a spirit , you could catch a walleye with your claw . ( SHE RUBS HER ARMS . ) My arms are always cold when HS is around the spirits . Ezekiel is the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HS Our world moved away . The visions are all I have . CAMERON HS is my vision . I ca n't get along without you , HS . You keep the walls from falling . HS I ca n't hold back your past . CAMERON James is my father 's truck ramming the house . I hear his engine . I feel the house shake . p. 19 HS The spirits will hold you . CAMERON You hold me . HS Let the walls fall , baby  --  there 's another world behind them . When you wait tables , call up your visions  --  CAMERON I put a plate on the table , round and white as your headlight coming back to me . I put a knife beside it like a small exhaust pipe  --  HS That 's it , baby . CAMERON ( ANGRY . ) You 're a visionary without a following , HS . JAMES I 'm the first disciple . Others will follow . CAMERON What is your mission ? HS To be true to the visions I see . ( CAMERON TURNS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cameron , but not in the sidecar of your apron pocket .
