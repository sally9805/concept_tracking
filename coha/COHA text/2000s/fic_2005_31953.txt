Chapter One UGLY FRANK I 've got four brothers . Imagine that . Five boys under eleven all living in the same house . On wet summer days , our house gets very crowded . If we each bring two friends home , then there could be fifteen of us crammed into the house . At least eight will be roaring like lunatics , and the rest will be dying to go to the toilet . The flusher on our toilet snaps off about once every three months . When my dad came home one day and found three sons and four strangers covered with war paint , swinging on the bedroom curtains , he decided that something had to be done . It did n't help that the war paint was stolen from Mom 's makeup box . " No more bringing friends home ! " Dad declared after the warriors ' parents had collected them . " That 's not fair , " said Marty , the biggest brother , mascara streaking his cheeks . " That punishment really affects me because I 'm popular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will . That 's me . I love that Action Man . Donnie , Bert , and HP started complaining , too . But only because they 're little brothers , and that 's what little brothers do for a living . I know that technically I 'm a little brother , too , but I 'm in the big-brother half of the family . Having one little brother is bad enough , but havingthree is too much punishment for one person . That 's enough punishment for an entire housing development . The trouble with little brothers is that they are never blamed for anything . All Donnie , Bert , and HP have to do is bat their blue eyes and let their bottom lips wobble a bit , and they are forgiven for everything . Donnie , Bert , and HP could stick an ax in my head and they 'd still get off with ten minutes ' no TV and a stern look . The only things that Marty and I ever agree on is that our three younger brothers are spoiled rotten . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he 's the chief lunatic , " I said , pointing to Marty . " I 'm not the one talking to dolls , " retorted Marty . That hurt . " Action Man is not a doll . " " Quiet ! " said Dad through gritted teeth . " There must be something we can find for you to do during the summer . Something to get you out of the house . " " Not my babies , " said Mom , hugging the younger-brother squad tightly . They gave her the full baby treatment-big baby eyes , gap-tooth smiles-and HP even sucked his thumb . That kid has no shame . " Maybe not those three . But Will and Marty are nine and ten now . We can find something for them . Something educational . " Marty and I groaned . Educational hobbies are the worst kind . They 're like school during the summer . Marty tried to save us . " Remember the last educational hobby ? The art classes . I was sick for days . " " That was your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a drink of water . " " You are not supposed to drink the water that people use to wash their brushes . " Dad was thinking . " What about the library ? " he said , finally . " What about it ? " I said , trying to sound casual , but my stomach was churning . " You both could join . Reading . It 's perfect . How can you cause trouble reading a book ? " " Yes , of course , it 's educational too , " Mom agreed . " How is it educational ? " I asked , terrified by the idea . " I 'd much rather be outside riding a horse than inside reading about one . " My mother tousled my hair . " Because , Will , sometimes the only horse you can ride is the one in your head . " I had no idea what that meant . " Do n't make us join the library , " Marty begged . " It 's too dangerous . " " Dangerous ? How could a library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the library , " Marty whispered . " It 's the librarian . " " Mrs. Murphy ? " said Mom . " She 's a lovely old lady . " The problem with grown-ups is that they only see what 's on the outside . But kids know the real truth . People forget to be on their best behavior around kids , because nobody believes a word we say . Every kid in our town knew about Mrs. Murphy . She was one of those people that kids steer clear of . Like Miss White , the teacher with the evil eye , or old Ned Sawyer , the tramp with the drooling dog . " She 's not a lovely old lady , " I said . " She 's a total nut . " " Will ! That 's a terrible thing to say . " " But she is , Mom . She hates kids and she used to be a spy in the army . Tracking kids from enemy countries . " " Now you 're being ridiculous . " " She has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A gas-powered one that takes an entire potato in the barrel . She shoots kids with it if they make a noise in the library . That 's why we call her Spud Murphy . " My mother thought this was all very funny . " A spud gun ! You 'll say anything to avoid reading a book . " " It 's true ! " Marty shouted . " Do you know Ugly Frank , from number forty-seven ? " My mother tried to look stern . " You should n't call poor Frank ugly . " " Well , how do you think he got that way ? Spud Murphy spudded him . " Mom waved her hands as if two annoying birds were flapping around her ears . " I 've heard enough . You two are going to the library for the afternoon and that 's it . We 'll make some sandwiches . " We stood in the kitchen glumly . Sandwiches would n't be much use against Spud Murphy and her gas-powered spud gun . Chapter Two STAY ON THE CARPET Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice knowing you , " said Donnie , shaking my hand . " Yeth , " said HP , the word whistling through the gap where his front teeth used to be . " Nithe knowing you . " Five years old and already a smart aleck . " Can I have your Walkman ? " asked Bert , who was already wearing it . I swatted them with my Action Man . " Do you hear them , Mom ? They 're teasing us already . " " Oh , they do n't mean it , " said Mom . " Do you , my little men ? " " No , Mommy . " Mom gave them a gummi bear each . I thought my head would pop with the unfairness of it all . " Now , Marty and Will , go upstairs and wash off the rest of my lipstick . We leave in ten minutes . " There was no escape . We pleaded and whined for ten minutes solid , but Mom was not giving an inch . " The library will be good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backseat of the car . " You might even learn something .
