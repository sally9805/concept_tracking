Remembrance of Things Past <p> EVENTUALLY IT CAME TO pass that no one ever had to die , unless they ran out of money . When you started to feel the little aches and twinges that meant your body was running down , you just got in line at Immortality , Incorporated , and handed them your credit card . As long as you had at least a million bucks - and eventually everybody did - they would reset you to whatever age you liked . <p> One way people made money was by swapping knowledge around . Skills could be transferred with a technology spun off from the immortality process . You could spend a few decades becoming a great concert pianist , and then put your ability up for sale . There was no shortage of people with two million dollars who would trade one million to be their village 's Van Cliburn . In the sale of your ability , you would lose it , but you could buy it back a few decades or centuries later . <p> For many people this became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your genius for youth , and then clawing your way up in some other field , to buy back the passion that had rescued you first from the grave . Enjoy it a few years , sell it again , and so on ad infinitum . Or finitum , if you just once made a wrong career move , and wound up old and poor and bereft of skill . That happened less and less often , of course , Darwinism inverted : the un-survival of the least fit . <p> It was n't just a matter of swapping around your piano-playing and brain surgery , of course . People with the existential wherewithal to enjoy century after century of life tended to grow and improve with age . A person could look like a barely pubescent teenybopper , and yet be able to out-Socrates Socrates in the wisdom department . People were getting used to seeing acne and gravitas on the same face . <p> Enter Jutel Dicuth , the paragon of his age , a raging polymath . He could paint and sculpt and play six instruments . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differential equations with his right . He could write formal poetry about differential equations ! He was an Olympic-class gymnast and also held the world record for the javelin throw . He had earned doctorates in anthropology , art history , slipstream physics , and fly-tying . <p> He sold it all . <p> Immensely wealthy but bereft of any useful ability , Jutel Dicuth set up a trust fund for himself that would produce a million dollars every year . It also provided a generous salary for an attendant . He had Immortality , Incorporated set him back to the apparent age of one year , and keep resetting him once a year . <p> In a world where there were no children - where would you put them ? - he was the only infant . He was the only person with no useful skills and , eventually , the only one alive who did not have nearly a thousand years of memory . <p> In a world that had outgrown the old religions - why would you need them ? - he became like unto a god . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to find a conduit to the state of blissful innocence buried under the weight of their wisdom . <p> It was inevitable that someone would see a profit in this . A consortium with a name we would translate as Blank Slate offered to " dicuth " anyone who had a certain large sum of what passed for money , and maintain them for as long as they wanted . At first people were slightly outraged , because it was a kind of sacrilege , or were slightly amused , because it was such a transparent scheme to gather what passed for wealth . <p> Sooner or later , though , everyone tried it . Most who tried it for one year went back for ten or a hundred , or , eventually , forever . After some centuries , permanent dicuths began to outnumber humans - though those humans were not anything you would recognize as people , crushed as they were by nearly a thousand years of wisdom and experience . And jealous of those who had given up . <p> On 31 December , A.D. 3000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dicuth bliss . The world was populated completely by total innocents , tended by patient machines . <p> It lasted a long time . Then one by one , the machines broke down . <p> Author Affiliation
