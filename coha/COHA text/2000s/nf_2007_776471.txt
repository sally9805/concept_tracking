Sparky // We 'll probably never see each other again . //  --  Dena Halverson Schulz // The great troop train , a quarter-mile of olive green carriages , rolled out of the depot and into the storm . Nearly a foot of snow had fallen on the Northwest through the day , and now , in the short winter afternoon , the blizzard veiled the domed heights of the State Capitol in St. Paul and the pyramid-capped Foshay Tower , tallest building in Minneapolis . Snow curtained the Twin Cities from one another , blurring everyday distances . Only the railroad and streetcar tracks cut clear black lines into the mounting white cover . // In the Pullman , Sparky kept to himself . No one yet knew him . At roll call he had come after " Schaust " and before " Sciortino , " but except for his place in the company roster he seemed to have no connection to the men and , as one of his seatmates was to recall , " no interest in joining in any conversation , " not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows only contributed to his impression that he had been thrown among " wild people . " // To his fellow recruits he presented himself as nondescript : simple , bland , unassuming  --  just another face in the crowd . With his regular looks , he passed for ordinary so easily that most people believed him when he insisted , as he did so often in later years , that he was a " nothing , " a " nobody , " an " uncomplicated man with ordinary interests , " although anyone who could attract attention to himself by being so sensitive and insecure had to be complicated . // Don Schaust , then seated alongside Schulz in the Pullman , later recalled that , as they rumbled across the Twin Cities , his seatmate remained silent , " very quiet , very low ? . ? . ? . ? deep in his own misery , " and how he had asked himself , " What 's the matter with this guy ? " // No matter what the others said or did , Sparky sat watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving no sign that he had just come through the worst days of his life . // He would never discuss the actual kind of cancer that had struck his mother . Throughout his life , friends , business associates , and most of his relatives believed that Dena Schulz had been the victim of colorectal cancer . In fact , the primary site of his mother 's illness was the cervix , and she had been seriously ill since 1938 . As early as his sophomore year in high school , Sparky had come home to a bedridden mother . // Some evenings she had been too ill to put food on the table ; some nights he had been awakened by her cries of pain . But no one spoke directly about her affliction ; only Sparky 's father and his mother 's trusted sister Marion knew its source , and they would not identify it as cancer in Sparky 's presence until after it had reached its fourth and final stage  --  in November 1942 , the same month he was drafted . // On February 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sparky returned from his army barracks to his mother 's bedside , mounting the stairs to the second-floor apartment at the corner of Selby and North Snelling Avenues to which the Schulzes had moved so that his father , at work in his barbershop on Selby , and the druggist in his pharmacy around the corner , could race upstairs to administer morphine during the worst of Dena 's agonies. // That evening , before reporting back to barracks , Sparky went into his mother 's bedroom . She was turned away from him in her bed against the wall , opposite the windows that overlooked the street . He said he guessed it was time to go . // " Yes , " she said , " I suppose we should say good-bye . " // She turned her gaze as best she could . " Well , " she said , " good-bye , Sparky . We 'll probably never see each other again . " // Later he said , " I 'll never get over that scene as long as I live , " and indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was certainly the worst night of his life , the night of " my greatest tragedy "  --  which he repeatedly put into the terms of his passionate sense of unfulfillment that his mother " never had the opportunity to see me get anything published . " // He saw her always from a distance , and as the years went by , with each stoical retelling , the moment became more and more iconic . It was safely frozen in time  --  as puzzling a farewell in its quiet , coolheaded resolve as the lines spoken by the mother as she prepares to lose her son in Citizen Kane : " I 've got his trunk all packed . I 've had it packed for a week now . " Frequently , often publicly , Sparky laid out the terrible resigned pathos of what his mother had said to him that night . Only as he got older and experienced parenthood himself would he " understand the pain and fear she must have had , thinking about what was to become of me. " // The blizzard had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on across St. Paul , and landmarks familiar even in the snow slipped past his window , alerting him that his own neighborhood was approaching . Then there it was for all to see . // Mud-brown , two-storied brick buildings huddled along his snowbound street . From where the Great Northern Railway overpass crossed North Snelling he could see down to the Selby intersection two blocks to the south , where since Monday he had sleepwalked through funeral arrangements with his father in his family 's rented walk-up . Even before this week of calamities , he had considered this part of St. Paul the setting of " my most influential section of life as a child . " // Above the buildings to his right , a Greek-pedimented entrance marked the huge elementary school he had attended . He could see Dayton Avenue , a sidestreet among whose small , somber dwellings Carl and Dena had lived in 1921 , during the first year of their marriage , and , next door , the roof under which his father had sheltered the family during the Great Depression , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scanty backyard where the kooky puppy Spike , living in his own world , had gobbled up some glass . There , on the corner of Selby and Snelling , was their streetcar stop , whence came , among his earliest memories , the image of himself getting aboard with his mother , a small boy on a stiff cane seat , off to the department stores. ? . ? . ? . //
