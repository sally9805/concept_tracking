<p> Eager for economic opportunities , some of South Korea 's richest men will travel with President Kim Dae-jung to his summit this week with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il . But once they get there , displaying their wealth is off-limits . <p> " Please do n't flash your dollars to the North Korean guides . That will displease them more than anything else , " Suh Young-kyo , a Seoul government official , told the businessmen and other members of President Kim 's entourage last week . <p> Suh was listing the dos and don'ts in North Korea for a 130-member South Korea entourage that will go to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang for the three-day summit , which begins Tuesday . Fifty South Korean journalists will also attend the first-ever meeting between leaders of the Koreas . <p> The makeup of the entourage speaks volumes about what South Korea 's Kim seeks at the summit . He will take with him many top industrialists and leading proponents of engagement with the communist North , but few military officials . <p> Nearly half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's key economic aides and ministers are on the list . A senior national security advisor accompanies Kim , but the defense minister is not on the list . A lone brigadier general is the highest-ranking representative of the South Korean military . <p> South Korea 's ultimate North Korea policy is to end half a century of Cold War animosities and eventually bring about reunification , a goal that remains distant . <p> Kim 's best card is South Korea 's economic might . Kim hopes that impoverished North Korea will agree to a gradual process of openness in return for investment and economic exchanges from the South . <p> The South Korean summit delegates will tread carefully for fear of injuring North Korea 's fierce pride . <p> " It 's OK to say thank you to North Koreans , but never pat them on their back . They may take it as an insult , " Suh lectured . " Do n't make jokes . And never carry any book or magazine that criticizes North Korea . That could disrupt the atmosphere for the summit . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LG and SK are sending their chairman or vice-chairman . All want to expand operations in the North , where labor is cheap . <p> Two of the businessmen , Chang Chi-hyuk and Kang Sung-mo , have more than money at stake . <p> They are among millions of family members hoping for reunion with relatives separated by the Korean War that ended in 1953 without a peace treaty . Such reunions will be a summit topic . <p> Delegate Chung Mong-joon , son of the founder of the Hyundai conglomerate , has sports as well as business in mind . As head of South Korea 's football association , he hopes to persuade North Korea to host a couple of games of the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament . South Korea and Japan are co-hosting the event . <p> Another member of the entourage is South Korean First Lady Lee Hee-ho , who is involved in charity work . She might not get to chat with her counterpart because Kim Jong Il 's wife , Kim Young Sook , has never attended state functions . <p> The South Korean group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president and maybe a couple of dogs . <p> Woo Moo-jong , president of South Korea 's National Canine Association , said he has asked President Kim to take two Jin-do dogs , which are indigenous to South Korea and a national symbol , as a present to Kim Jong Il . It is not known whether the dogs will make the trip . <p> The summit this week between leaders of North Korea and South Korea has been delayed by one day at the North 's request , the Seoul government said Sunday . <p> The first-ever summit between the Koreas was delayed for " minor technical reasons " and was not in jeopardy , said Park June-young , chief spokesman for President Kim Dae-jung . He did not elaborate . <p> Kim 's three-day summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il will begin Tuesday in Pyongyang , according to the South Korean government . The meeting offers hopes for gradual reconciliation on the Korean peninsula after decades of bitter conflict . <p> " The chief executive believes that waiting for one extra day is not a major issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Park said in a statement . <p> Park said North Korea requested the delay in a telephone message sent late Saturday night through Panmunjom , a border village inside the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas . <p> " The North side requested the delay to make thorough preparations , so there will be no problems with President Kim 's visit and stay in Pyongyang , " the national Yonhap news agency quoted Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu as saying . <p> A 30-member South Korean advance team is in Pyongyang to help prepare President Kim 's itinerary and press coverage . Both Koreas have decided not to disclose details of the summit itinerary . <p> The two Korean leaders are expected to discuss the dispatch of economic aid from the rich South to the impoverished North , as well as the reunion of separated families . Among the most contentious issues that might be raised are the U.S. military presence in South Korea , and North Korea 's missile and nuclear programs . <p> North Korea 's agreement to host a summit is a notable compromise because it previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it considered illegitimate . <p> The two countries agreed to a summit in 1994 . But North Korean leader Kim Il Sung died at age 82 only weeks before he was to meet his South Korean counterpart , Kim Young-sam . <p> Kim Il Sung 's son and successor , Kim Jong Il , consolidated his power in the years that followed . <p> The peninsula was divided at the end of World War II in 1945 into the communist North and the pro-Western South . A heavily militarized border separates the two countries . <p> The summit this week between leaders of North and South Korea has been delayed by one day at the North 's request , the Seoul government said Sunday . <p> The first-ever inter-Korean summit was delayed for " minor technical reasons " and not in jeopardy , said Park June-young , chief spokesman for President Kim Dae-jung . He did not elaborate . <p> Culture and Tourism Minister Park Jie-won said that North Korea complained about South Korean media reports detailing President Kim 's itinerary in the North , but he was not sure whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay . <p> " It is true that North Korea complained about the South Korean reports on the itinerary , " Park said at a reception for foreign journalists ahead of the summit . <p> Kim 's three-day summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il will begin Tuesday in Pyongyang , according to the South Korean government .
