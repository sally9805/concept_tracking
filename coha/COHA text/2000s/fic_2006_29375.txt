Kill All the Lawyers By Paul Levine Random House Paul Levine Fish Out of Water Wearing boxers and nothing else , eyes still crusty with sleep , Steve Solomon smacked the front door with his shoulder . Stuck . Another smack , another shove , and the door creaked open . Which was when Steve noticed the three-hundred-pound fish , its razored bill jammed through the peephole . A blue marlin . Dangling there , as if frozen in midleap . He had seen alligators slithering out of neighborhood canals . He had heard wild parrots squawking in a nearby park . He had stepped on palmetto bugs the size of roller skates . But even in the zoo that was Miami , this qualified as weird . Steve glanced up and down Kumquat Avenue , a leafy street a mile from the brackish water of Biscayne Bay . Nada . Not a creature was stirring , not even a crab . He checked the front of his bungalow , the stucco faded the color of pool algae . No other animals lodged in windows or eaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flies buzzed around the marlin 's head . The air , usually scented jasmine in the morning dew , took on a distinctively fishy smell . A trickle of sweat ran down Steve 's chest , the day already steaming with moist heat . He grabbed the newspaper , sprinkled with red berries from a pepper tree , like blood spatter at a crime scene . Nothing on the front page abouta late-night tidal wave . He considered other possibilities . Bobby , of course . His twelve-year-old nephew was a jokester , but where would he have come up with a giant fish ? And who would have helped the kid hoist it into place ? " Bobby ! " " Yeah ? " " Would you come out here , please ? " " Yeah . " Yeah being the oxygen of adolescent lungs . Steve heard the boy 's bare feet padding across the tile . A moment later , wearing a Miami Dolphins jersey that hung to his knees , Bobby appeared at the fish-sticked front door . " Holy shit ! " " Watch your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeglasses and cleaned the lenses with the tail of his jersey . " I did n't do it , Uncle Steve . " " Never said you did . " Steve slapped at his neck , squashing a mosquito and leaving a bloody smear . " Got any ideas ? " " Could be one of those **25;1179;TOOLONG deals . " Steve tried to remember if he had offended anyone lately . Not a soul , if you did n't count judges , cops , and creditors . He scratched himself through his boxers , and his nephew did the same through his Jockeys , two males of the species in deep-thinking mode . " You know what 's really ironic , kiddo ? " " What ? " " My shorts . " Steve pointed to his Florida Marlins orange-and-teal boxers , where giant fish leapt from the sea . " You 're confusing irony and coincidence , Uncle Steve , " the little wise guy said . * * * Twenty minutes later , Victoria Lord showed up , carrying a bag of bagels , a tub of cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed Steve on the cheek , tousled Bobby 's hair , and said : " I suppose you know there 's a marlin hanging on your front door . " " I did n't do it , " Bobby repeated . " So what 's up ? " Victoria asked . Steve shrugged and grabbed the bagels . " Probably some neighborhood kids . " He had showered , shaved , and put on jeans and a tropical shirt with pictures of surfers on giant waves , his uniform for days with no court appearances . Before Victoria came into his life , he would have moseyed into the office wearing shorts , flip-flops and a T-shirt reading : " Lawyers Do It in Their Briefs . " At the time , Steve 's cut-rate law firm had the embellished name of Solomon &; Associates . In truth , Steve 's only associates were the roaches that crawled out of the splintered wainscoting . Now it was Solomon &; Lord . Victoria had brought a touch of class along with furniture polish , fresh lilies , and an insistence that Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wore a silk blouse the hue of a ripe peach , stretchy gray slacks , and a short jacket woven with intricate geometrical shapes . Five foot eleven in her velvet-toed Italian pumps . Perfect posture . Blond hair , a sculpted jaw , and bright green eyes . An overall package that projected strength and smarts and sexiness . " You listen to the radio this morning ? " Victoria asked . Steve poured her a thimbleful of cafe Cubano , syrupy thick . " Sure . Mad Dog Mandich 's sports report . " " Dr. Bill 's talk show . " " That quack ? Why would I listen to him ? " " He was talking about you , partner . " " Do n't believe a word he says . " " Why did n't you tell me you were his lawyer ? " Steve took his time spreading cream cheese on a poppyseed bagel . " It was a long time ago . " Evading all questions about Dr. William Kreeger . Pop psychiatrist . Mini-celebrity . And now ex-con . " What 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll sue him for slander . " " Said you could n't win a jaywalking case if the light was green . " " Gon na get punitive damages . " " Claimed you barely graduated from a no-name law school . " " The Key West School of Law has a name ; it just does n't have accreditation . " " He said you botched his trial and that he 'd sue you for malpractice , except he has no faith in the justice system . Then he ranted about O. J. Simpson and Robert Blake and Michael Jackson . " " I saw O.J. at Dadeland the other day , " Bobby said , munching a bagel . " He 's really fat . " " So did you screw up Dr. Bill 's case ? " Victoria asked Steve . " I did a great job . The jury could have nailed him for murder but came back with manslaughter . " " Then why 's he so mad at you ? " " Aw , you know clients . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Bill ? " If he told her , Steve knew , she 'd go ballistic . " You did what ? That 's unethical ! Illegal ! Immoral ! " " Nothing happened . He did time , so he blames me . " " Uh-huh . " She sipped at the Cuban coffee . " Bobby , you know how I can tell when your uncle 's lying ? " " His lips are moving , " the boy answered . " He speaks very quietly and puts on this really sincere look . " " I 'm telling the truth , " Steve said . " I do n't know why the bastard 's mad at me . " Technically , that was true . Steve knew exactly what he did wrong in Kreeger 's case . He just did n't know what Kreeger knew . On appeal , the guy never claimed ineffective counsel . He never sued for malpractice or filed disbarment proceedings . Instead , he went off and served six years , worked in the prison mental health facility , and got early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kreeger had a clinical psychiatry practice in Coral Gables and had achieved notoriety with a self-help book , But Enough About You . He peddled a simplistic me-first philosophy , and after a puff piece on Good Morning America , he landed his own syndicated TV show where he dispensed feel-good one-liners along with relationship advice . Women adored the guy , and his ratings shot into Oprah territory . " You ever see Kreeger on TV ? " Steve asked . " Caught his show when I was in college . I loved the advice he 'd give those women . ' Drop the jerk ! Drop-kick him out of your life right now . ' " " Ever notice his eyes ? " " A killer 's eyes ? " Bobby sneaked a sip of the cafe Cubano . It only took a thimbleful to turn him into a whirling dervish . " Like Hannibal Lecter . Or Freddy Krueger . Or Norman Bates . Killers , killers , killers ! " " They 're fictional characters , not real killers , " Steve corrected him . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his uncle , hoisted the cup , and took a gulp . " Ted Bundy . Ted Kaczynski . John Wayne Gacy . Real enough , Uncle Steve ? " " Cool it , kiddo . " " David Berkowitz . Dennis Rader . Mr. Callahan . . . " " Who 's Mr. Callahan ? " Victoria asked . " My P.E . teacher , " the boy replied . " He 's a real dipstick . " Bobby 's rebellious streak had started with the onset of puberty . If it were up to Steve , his nephew would have stayed a little kid forever . Playing catch , riding bikes , camping out in the Glades . But the kid had become a steaming kettle of testosterone . He was already interested in girls , dangerous terrain for even the well-adjusted . For a troubled boy like Bobby , this new frontier would be even more treacherous . " Last warning , and I mean it . " Steve poured some molten steel into his voice . " No more coffee , no more murderers , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drew a finger-hush , hush-to his lips . Steve nodded his thanks and turned to Victoria . " What were you saying about Kreeger 's eyes ? " " Hot , " Victoria said . " Dark , glowing coals . The camera would come in so close you could almost feel the heat . " " Turned women on , " Steve said . " What about that woman in his hot tub ? Did he kill her ? " " Jury said he did , in a manslaughterly kind of way . " " What do you say ? " " I never breach a client 's confidence . " Victoria laughed . " Since when ? " " Dr. William Kreeger is out of my life . " " But you 're not out of his . What are n't you telling me ? " " Wil-liam Kree-ger , " Bobby said , drawing out the syllables , his eyes narrowing . Steve knew the boy was working up an anagram from Kreeger 's name . Bobby 's central nervous system deficit had a flip side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kid had a savant 's capacity to memorize reams of data . Plus the ability to work out anagrams in his head . " William Kreeger , " the boy repeated . " I EMERGE , KILL RAW . " " Nicely done , " Steve complimented him . " So you do think he 's a murderer ? " Victoria cross-examined . " The jury 's spoken . So has the judge and the appellate court . I respect all of them . " " Hah . " " Do n't you have to get to court , Vic ? " " I 've got lots of time . " " But I do n't . Bobby , let 's go to school . " " I 'd rather watch you two fight , " the boy said . " We 're not fighting , " Steve said . " Yet . " Victoria studied him , her eyes piercing green laser beams . " This morning , Dr. Bill challenged you to come on the air and defend yourself . " " Forget it . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not on some third-rate radio program . " " Are n't you the guy who bought ads on the back of ambulances ? " " Ancient history , Vic , " Steve said . " I 've decided to become more like you . Principled and dignified . " " Uncle Steve 's speaking softly again , " Bobby said , " and trying to look sincere . " * * * Thirty minutes later , Steve was headed across the MacArthur Causeway toward Miami Beach . He had kissed Victoria good-bye and dropped off Bobby at Ponce de Leon Middle School . Now , as his old Mustang rolled past the cruise ships lined up at the port , Steve tried to process the morning 's information . What was this feeling of dread creeping over him ? The last time he 'd seen Kreeger was at the sentencing . It had been a messy case with just enough tabloid elements-drugs , sex , celebrity-to attract media attention . A woman named Nancy Lamm had drowned in three feet of water . Unfortunately for Kreeger , the water was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have been so bad , except for the gash on Nancy Lamm 's skull . Then there was the tox scan revealing a potent mixture of barbiturates and booze . The pills had come from Kreeger , which was a big no-no . He was a court-appointed expert in Nancy 's child custody case , so he should n't have been playing footsie with her in a Jacuzzi . In an unseemly breach of medical ethics , Kreeger and Nancy had become lovers . The state claimed they 'd had a spat , and she was going to blow the whistle on him with the state medical board . Armed with proof of motive , the state charged Kreeger with murder . Steve could still remember his closing argument . He used the trial lawyer 's trick of the loaded rhetorical question . " Is Dr. William Kreeger a stupid man ? No , he has a near-genius IQ . Is he a careless man ? No , quite the contrary . He 's precise and meticulous . So , ask yourselves , if Dr. Kreeger were inclined to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Would he be present at the time of death ? Would he admit to police that he had provided a controlled substance to the victim ? I think you know the answers . This was an unfortunate accident , not an act of murder . " The jury returned a compromise verdict : guilty of involuntary manslaughter . Not a bad result , Steve thought-but then , he did n't have to serve the time . Now he dredged up everything he could remember about the moment the jury came back with the verdict . Kreeger did n't even wince . Not one of those clients whose knees buckle and eyes brim with tears . Kreeger did n't blame Steve . Thanked him , in fact , for doing his best . Kreeger hired another lawyer for the appeal , but nothing unusual there . Appellate work was brief writing . Steve was never much for book work , and footnotes gave him a headache . He never heard from Kreeger again . Not a call or postcard from prison . And nothing when he got out . So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling me a shyster and challenging me to debate him on the air ? Steve did n't like the answer . Only one thing could have changed . He found out . Somehow , he found out exactly what I did . Meaning Kreeger also figured out that he would have been acquitted if any other lawyer on the planet had defended the case . And that marlin on the door ? It had to be a message from Kreeger , something they both would understand . A marlin . Not a grouper or a shark or a moray eel . A marlin had significance for both of them . So what 's Kreeger want ? Steve tried the loose-thread approach , something his father taught him . " Whenever you 're stumped and feeling dumb as a suck-egg mule , " Herbert T. Solomon used to drawl , " grab a loose thread and pull the cotton-picking thing till you find where it leads . &; Continues ...
