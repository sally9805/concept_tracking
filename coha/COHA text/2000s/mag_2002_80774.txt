Exorcising Devils Maryland proved that it 's a national title contender with an impressive rout of Duke // The official box score indicates that Maryland guard Juan Dixon did n't have an assist during the Terrapins ' 87-73 win over Duke at Cole Field House on Sunday . The day before , however , Dixon provided something more valuable when he suggested to coach Gary Williams before practice that 6 ' 10 " sophomore Chris Wilcox , not 6 ' 6 " senior Byron Mouton , guard Mike Dunleavy , the Blue Devils ' 6 ' 9 " forward . Dunleavy scored 19 second-half points in Duke 's 99-78 rout of Maryland when the teams last met , on Jan. 17 , and he creates matchup problems for most teams because of his height inside and his shooting ability outside . " Dunleavy 's not that quick , " Dixon said after Sunday 's game . " He can shoot and put the ball on the floor , but Chris is very athletic . I knew he 'd have a good shot at stopping him . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five of his 15 points in the game 's final 31 minutes . He also punished the Blue Devils on the offensive end , with a career-high 23 points to go along with 11 rebounds , three assists and two steals . Wilcox 's performance helped lead Maryland ( 21-3 , 11-1 in the ACC ) to a resounding wire-to-wire win that gave it sole possession of first place in the conference through Sunday ( the Terps have n't won an outright regular-season title since 1980 ) and a No. 2 ranking . " Chris is quick enough that if he makes mistakes , he can recover , " Williams says . " Usually only guards can do that . " // With Dunleavy locked up , Wilcox 's teammates could focus on containing Duke guard Jason Williams , who was thoroughly outplayed by his Maryland counterpart , Steve Blake . Williams finished with 17 points but made only 6 of 22 shots and had six turnovers to four assists . Blake , meanwhile , had 13 assists and only one turnover to go with eight points . Their matchup was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half when Blake sneaked up on Williams  --  who was dribbling the ball while holding for the final shot and had turned to get instructions from coach Mike Krzyzewski  --  stole the ball at midcourt and went in for a layup . " We were a little bit flustered , " Krzyzewski said . " You can get away with that if the other team is n't playing well , but Maryland was playing well . " // Wilcox has played well at other times during his two seasons in College Park , but too often he has made spectacular plays while failing to complete routine ones . As his consistency has improved , so have his stats : He was averaging 11.0 points , an increase from 3.6 a game last season , and his rebounding had improved from 2.1 a game to 7.7 . On Sunday , Wilcox , a 51.6% free throw shooter entering the game , made 7 of 9 from the line . He also brings an impish personality to the Terps . Says junior guard Drew Nicholas , " Chris is probably the one guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be real serious . " // For Maryland , Sunday 's game was n't only a win , it was an exorcism . For all the talk of how terrific a rivalry this has become , Duke ( 23-2 and 11-2 ) had beaten the Terps in five of their previous six meetings , and after twice blowing leads against the Blue Devils in epic fashion last season  --  including a 22-point advantage in the Final Four-Maryland needed to clear this psychological hurdle to establish itself as a national championship contender . Gary Williams tried to downplay this on Sunday , saying , " We did n't win anything today . All we proved is that we can beat Duke . " // Given the Terps ' history , that 's not an insignificant feat . // Pitt Back on Track Panthers on The Prowl // Back in the fall , when Pittsburgh was picked by the media to finish sixth out of the seven teams in the Big East 's West Division , coach Ben Howland 's first thought was , Perfect . // " From the outside I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had lost his top two scorers and rebounders from a team that had gone 7-9 in the conference ( 19-14 overall ) last season . " I liked being picked low because it meant we were a bit under the radar . " // Nobody is overlooking Pitt now . Led by the stellar play of junior point guard Brandin Knight , who was averaging 15.6 points , 6.8 assists , 5.0 rebounds and 2.3 steals through Sunday , the Panthers were atop the Big East 's West Division with a 10-3 record ( 22-4 overall ) and ranked 11th in the nation . Pittsburgh 's success can be traced to the end of last season , when the Panthers played their best ball and clawed their way to the Big East tournament championship game by upsetting Notre Dame and Syracuse before falling to Boston College . In that loss Howland saw a blueprint for the future . " BC just pushed us around , " Howland says . " It was obvious that we had to get stronger . " // Last year 's starting center was senior Isaac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds ; now the center is 6 ' 10 " , 282-pound Toree Morris , who teams with 6 ' 8 " , 238-pound forward Donatas Zavackas on an imposing front line . Howland also made sure the Panthers hit the weight room during the off-season , and the results are evident : Pitt led the conference in rebounding margin ( +7.2 ) and scoring defense ( 59.8 points a game ) . " Coach wants us to make our opponents uncomfortable , " says sophomore guard Julius Page . " That means slowing down the up-tempo teams and pushing it against the slower teams . " // The key to controlling tempo is the play of the 6-foot Knight , whose brother , Brevin , plays for the Memphis Grizzlies . He is Pitt 's emotional leader and the player the Panthers turn to in the clutch . After Pitt trailed Syracuse by 14 points with 13 minutes left at the Carrier Dome on Feb. 10 , Knight scored 11 of Iris team-high 16 points as the Panthers rallied for a 75-63 victory . " I 'm lucky to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East MVP candidate . " He makes us go . " // That Pitt is in position to win its first Big East title in 14 years is a testament to Howland , who made a name for himself at Northern Arizona before taking over a Panthers ' program in disarray three years ago . Pitt was an embarrassment on and off the court in the season before he took over . It lost 15 of its final 22 games , and guard Fred Primus was arrested for grand theft on a road trip to Villanova . Later that season forward Attila Cosby had been suspended for fighting with an assistant coach during a practice . // Under Howland , such transgressions have become things of the past , and Pitt appears to be a lock to earn its first NCAA tournament bid since 1993 . The future looks bright as well : The Panthers will lose only one player to graduation ( backup swingman Chad Johnson ) and will move next year from antiquated Fitzgerald Field House to the $70 million , 12,500-seat Petersen Events Center . But as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that the program has a long way to go . " We ca n't start thinking about next week , let alone next year , " he says . " At this point we 're not guaranteed anything . "  --  Josh Elliott // Diminishing Returns Stars with Lost Luster // After testing the NBA waters last spring and finding them cold , guard Keith Bogans returned to Kentucky to try to boost his NBA stock . Instead his value has fallen . The low point came on Feb. 9 , when Wildcats coach Tubby Smith benched Bogans for the final 18 minutes , 12 seconds of Kentucky 's 68-56 win at LSU after Bogans had taken an ill-advised shot . Asked the next day to compare Bogans 's play this season with last year 's performance , Smith said , " There is no comparison . I ca n't put a finger on what 's wrong , except there 's been more pressure on him . " // Bogans is one of several stars , including Illinois point guard Frank Williams and Iowa 's Reggie Evans and Luke Recker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bogans 's scoring average of 11.8 points per game through Sunday was down 5.2 from Iris sophomore year , and his field goal percentage ( 39.1% ) and three-point percentage ( 32.8% ) were lower than those of his freshman season . Many observers around the SEC believe that Bogans never recovered from his mediocre performance at the NBA 's predraft camp in Chicago last June . " It looks to me as if he 's pressing too hard , " one conference assistant coach says . " When kids come back who could n't get drafted , sometimes they try to improve their stock instead of letting the game come to them . " // Williams , who unlike Bogans might have been a first-round pick had he entered the draft last spring , has had his troubles as well . Last season the mini 's two best inside players were seniors ( and Williams 's old high school teammates ) Marcus Griffin and Sergio McClain . Without them this year Williams 's scoring average was up nearly two points a game , to 16.7 , but he had seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor and 30.5% from three-point range ) had been dismal . In a particularly poor stretch for Williams , from Jan. 5 to Feb. 3 , Illinois lost five of eight games . Williams attributes his poor play to tired legs , and while the Mini seemed to have regained their footing with four straight wins , Williams still has to prove he can consistently carry a team . " His teammates were better last year , so his weaknesses were n't as glaring , " one NBA executive says . " If Frank is trying to impress NBA scouts , he has n't done it . " // Iowa 's disappointing season  --  the Hawkeyes were a preseason favorite in the Big Ten but were tied for ninth place in the conference with a 4-9 record  --  can be attributed in part to the poor play and lack of leadership shown by senior captains Evans and Recker . During a recent span of three games Recker shot 32.2% from the field . He was benched for the start of last Saturday 's 72-66 home loss to Ohio State along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three points . // Though Evans , a 6 ' 8 " forward , was third in the nation in rebounding ( 11.5 a game ) , his scoring average had dipped from 17.9 points in nonconference games to 14.3 in league play , and he had often disappeared late in games . Evans , who was benched for the Ohio State game for not attending class , also had argued openly with his teammates on several occasions , and he had almost twice as many turnovers ( 73 ) as assists ( 38 ) . Even after Evans had one of his best games of the season , with 23 points and 13 rebounds in a 71-65 loss to Penn State on Feb. 13 , Hawkeyes coach Steve Alford offered him a backhanded compliment " Reggie probably played the best game of anybody on our team , " Alford said . " Yet those last three minutes , he gets dominated . " // The upshot is , Iowa will have to repeat as Big Ten conference tournament champion if it 's going to go to the NCAA tournament this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine again .
