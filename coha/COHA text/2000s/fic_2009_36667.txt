The Beginning of the End <p> Whoosh ! The forty-foot-long scimitar slices through the sky , aimed straight at me . It 's a near miss , but the sudden partition of air created by the weapon produces gale-force winds . The air column pushes me backward several hundred yards , enough so I can size up my dreaded opponent . Genghis Kong , the giant Barbarian , has escaped from his unusually large prison off the coast , its powerful electromagnetic fencing disrupted by offshore oil exploration , and he 's back in Los Angeles for a weekend of rest , relaxation , and wanton destruction . I fly back up into his face . <p> " Your furlough ends now , " I shout at him . Genghis came looking for freedom , but Freedom found him . <p> I 'm sure he can barely hear me . The sound of rotors from military choppers is deafening . Not sure what they think they can do , and the Pentagon 's highly touted Barbarian Defense Shield has been a total failure . <p> Genghis was part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company had created an entire line of genetically altered superfoods , like twenty-foot rutabagas . Realizing they had n't thought of a way to harvest the humongous produce , the company quickly bred giant farm workers to do the job . Unfortunately , the giants proved harder to control than the average migrant worker and escaped out into the world , seeking better-paying jobs and , in some instances , a life of crime . <p> My cell phone vibrates in a hidden panel in my costume . It 's nice to have , a great convenience , but I can imagine my mentor Chief Justice looking down from his Secret Headquarters in the sky and frowning . The man had no use for nondestructive technology . The Chief did n't even own an answering machine . <p> I hover in midair . Holding still above Earth takes quite a bit of concentration  --  it 's somewhere between treading water and doing Kegel exercises . I hope it 's my sidekick calling . He has n't been taking my calls lately . I do n't recognize the number on the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello ? " <p> " Uh , Mr. Freedom ? " <p> " That 's Captain , " I correct , and know right away it 's a telemarketer . <p> " The New York Bank of the Americas has a great credit card offer . " <p> I have no time for this . " What 's the APR ? Annual fee ? Do you have any way to capture a rampaging Barbarian ? " <p> " Uh , I 'll have to check with my supervisor . Can you hold ? " <p> There is no way that Genghis is acting alone . He 's a Barbarian , and though I consider myself a tolerant person and have several Barbarian American friends , they generally are n't the smartest group . And they stink . I 'm relieved he did n't bring his giant horse . <p> " Sir , we do n't have anything specifically for Barbarians , but we do offer a concierge service and I 'm sure they could help you with that sort of thing . " <p> " Great . Sign me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope , without being rude . By the end of the day I should have a new DisasterCard  --  My Strife , My Card . <p> I click off the phone , fly as fast as I can , and smack Genghis in the back . He ignores me and turns toward downtown L.A. <p> But who  --  or what  --  controls him ? <p> Whoever it is must be close by , but we 're on an isolated patch of ruined freeway . It 's just me , him , and the helicopters . Then I see it . One of the choppers has a different insignia , not Army or LAPD or Eyewitness News 7 . The markings belong to that French triumvirate of terror , Les MisTrables , and I 'll bet anything that the Villain inside is Enfant Terrible . <p> Terrible 's supposed to be in jail serving out a long sentence for importing raw-milk cheese . Supervillains always get out . Sometimes a spectacular escape is involved , but they usually get released because of budget cuts . <p> My day is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My career 's entered an irrevocable tailspin . There 's an important dinner party that I 'm going to miss . My girlfriend is n't speaking to me . I 'm in no mood for Enfant 's merde . <p> I fly up and rip open the helicopter door and step inside . " Thought you needed a breeze in here . " <p> The pilot looks confused and then taps on his helmet . He ca n't hear me . I grab a spare headset and repeat myself . <p> " Captain Freedom , " crackles the snide , nasal voice of Enfant Terrible over the headset . " The Barbarian is on a collision course with your beloved city . Think you can stop him ? Or maybe you should warn the citizens first . Oh , the dilemma ! " He laughs a French laugh . <p> I fly away to face Genghis , and he pulls out another weapon . It 's light blue and looks something like a mace . His arm flits down toward me , and I change direction quickly . So does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to figure out what he 's holding . The sword was better . Where would you get a forty-foot sword sharpened , anyway ? <p> The weapon comes down on me . The uniform distribution of pores tells me what it is : a giant flyswatter . He 's got me on the ground , pinned . <p> I ca n't focus . Too many other things on my mind . There 's been a little trouble at work . I 've made some mistakes , but what can I say  --  I 'm only human ( partly ) . I need to get back to my party and fix things . If I do n't get out of here , my soufflT will be ruined . But that 's no reason to fight like an amateur . <p> The implement presses down on me . I feel at least one rib crack . <p> Nobody breaks my bones and gets away with it . The enormous Barbarian might be strong , but I 'm stronger . I push with all my strength , breathing into the pain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , I blast into the sky with a plan . The MisTrables helicopter hovers nearby . Probably needs to be close by to control Genghis . After I catch the rotor in my hands , I rip it off and then grab the chopper by the skids . Heavier than I thought . <p> <br> Continues ...
