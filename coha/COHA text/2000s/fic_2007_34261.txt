one Everyone was looking for Jennifer Jones . She was dangerous , the newspapers said . She posed a threat to children and should be kept behind bars . The public had a right to know where she was . Some of the weekend papers even resurrected the old headline : a life for a life ! Alice Tully read every article she could find . Her boyfriend , Frankie , was bemused . He could n't understand why she was so fascinated . He put his arm around her shoulder and dipped his mouth into her neck while she was reading . Alice tried to push him away , but he would n't take no for an answer and in the end the newspaper crumpled and slipped onto the ground . Alice could n't resist Frankie . He was bigger and taller than she , but that was n't difficult . Most people were . Alice was small and thin and often bought her clothes cheaply in the children 's section of clothes shops . Frankie was a giant beside her , and he liked to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were having an argument . It was his way of making up . She was lucky to have him . She much preferred to read the articles about Jennifer Jones when she was on her own . It meant waiting until Rosie , the woman she lived with , was out at work . It gave her plenty of time . Rosie worked long hours . She was a social worker and had a lot of clients to see . In any case , the stories about Jennifer Jones were n't around all the time . They came in waves . Sometimes they roared from the front page , the headlines bold and demanding . Sometimes they were tiny , a column on an inside page , a nugget of gossip floating on the edge of the news , hardly causing a ripple of interest . When the killing first happened , the news was in every paper for months . The trial had thrown up dozens of articles from all angles . The events on that terrible day at Berwick Waters . The background . The home lives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . The law regarding children and murder . Some of the tabloids focused on the seedier side : the attempts to cover up the crime ; the details of the body ; the lies told by the children . Alice Tully had n't seen any of these at the time . She had been too young . In the past six months , though , she had read as much as she could get her hands on , and the question that lay under every word that had ever been printed was the same : How could a ten-year-old girl kill another child ? In the weeks leading up to the ninth of June , Alice Tully 's seventeenth birthday , the stories started again . Jennifer Jones had finally been released . She had served six years for murder ( the judge had called it manslaughter but that was just a nice word ) . She had been let out on license , which meant that she could be called back to prison at any time . She had been relocated somewhere far from where she was brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who she was and what she had done . Alice fell hungrily on these reports , just as she sat coiled up and tense in front of Rosie 's telly , using her thumb to race past the satellite channels , catching every bit of footage of the Jennifer Jones case . The news programs still used the only photograph that there had ever been of the ten-year-old . A small girl with long hair and bangs , a frowning expression on her face . JJ was the little girl 's nickname . The journalists loved it . It made Alice feel weak just to look at it . On the morning of her birthday , Rosie woke her up with a birthday card and present . " Here , sleepyhead . " Alice opened her eyes and looked upward at Rosie . She had her dark suit on and the white striped blouse she always wore with it . Her hair was tied back off her face , making her look serious and stern . Instead of her usual hanging earrings she was wearing gold studs . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me , you 're in court today ! " Alice said , sitting up , stretching her arms out , ruffling her fingers through her own short hair . " You guessed it ! " Rosie said . " Here , take this , birthday girl ! " Alice took the present while Rosie walked to the window and pushed it open . A light breeze wafted in , lifting the net curtains . Alice pulled the duvet tight , up to her neck . " Do you want to freeze me to death ? " she said , jokingly . Rosie took no notice . She loved fresh air . She spent a lot of her time opening windows , and Alice spent a lot of time closing them . Inside the wrapping paper was a small box , the kind that held jewelry . For a moment Alice was worried . Rosie 's taste in jewelry was a bit too artsy for her . She lifted the lid off gingerly and saw a pair of tiny gold earrings . " These are lovely , " Alice said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " More your taste than mine , " Rosie said , looking in Alice 's wall mirror and pulling at her jacket , using the flats of her hands to smooth out her skirt . She looked uncomfortable . Alice got out of bed and stood beside her . She held an earring up to one ear and nodded approvingly . Then she squeezed Rosie 's arm . " You 're on lates this week ? " Rosie said . Alice nodded . She did n't have to be at work until ten . " I 'll be home early . So I 'm going to cook a special meal , " Rosie said . " And it 's not only your birthday we 're celebrating . Next Saturday , you 'll have been here for six months ! " That was true . Six months of waking up every morning in that bedroom , of eating in Rosie 's kitchen , of seeing her name on letters : alice tully , 52 phillip street , croydon . " My mum 's coming . What about Frankie ? " Rosie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice . Her mother , Kathy , a funny Irish woman , was helping her . " He ca n't come . " She did n't bother to explain . Frankie said he felt awkward around Rosie , as though she were watching him , waiting to tell him off every time he touched Alice . He preferred it when they were alone . " Oh well . It 'll be just the three of us then . " After Rosie left , Alice sat on her bed holding the earrings and looking at her card . There would be nothing from her mother , she knew that . She sat very still for a moment , aware of her own body , trying to read her own sensations . Was she upset ? She had other presents and cards . She had Frankie and her friends from the Coffee Pot . Then there was Rosie herself . Rosie with her powerful hug and no-nonsense manner ; Rosie who smelled of lemons and garlic and basil and who was always trying to fatten her up . Dear , sweet Rosie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the letter box distracted her . She got up and took her card over to the mantelpiece and stood it up . Then she walked downstairs to the front door where the morning paper was sticking through the letter box . She pulled it out , taking care not to graze it or tear the pages , and took it back up to the kitchen . Without looking she laid it down on the kitchen table and got on with making her breakfast . She tipped out some cereal and poured milk into her bowl . One teaspoon of sugar was all she wanted . Then she got out the orange juice and poured herself exactly half a glass . Where eating was concerned she had a routine . She was n't fussed about her weight or her shape . She just ate what she wanted and no amount of persuasion from anyone was going to change that . She sat down and flattened the newspaper . There it was again , the headline she had expected . JENNIFER JONES FREE AFTER SIX YEARS Is this justice ? FONT-FAMILY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her wrist trembled as she lowered her spoon into the bowl and scooped up some cereal . The story was the same as every other one that she had read over the last weeks . Should Jennifer have been released ? Should she stay in Britain ? Is she a danger to children ? Then there was the revenge angle : Would the dead girl 's parents try to find Jennifer ? As ever , the newspaper gave a brief outline of the story of that day at Berwick Waters . Alice read it . It was just like all the others . She had read them all . If anyone had asked she could have probably recited it by heart . A bright blue day in May , six years before . The sun was staring down from the sky , but a sharp breeze bothered the bushes and flowers , bending them this way and that . When it died down , the sun 's glare was heavy , and for a fleeting moment it might have seemed like a midsummer day .
