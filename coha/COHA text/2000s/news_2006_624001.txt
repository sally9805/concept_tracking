<p> Patrick McCullough still looks each way whenever he steps out his front door and walks down 59th Street in North Oakland . But it 's no longer out of fear . <p> These days , he feels safe enough to take those walks more often with his wife and son . Instead of the cold stares of angry young men , McCullough is greeted by strangers who thank him for taking a stand against the drug dealers who used to rule Bushrod Park and the surrounding streets . <p> " This street is so cool right now , " McCullough , 50 , said on a recent sunny day . " Look around , man , all these kids playing in the park and no thugs . The immediate neighborhood is much quieter and , for the most part , free of drug dealers , craps shooters and intoxicant-using loiterers . " <p> A year ago , 59th Street was the scene of a series of violent incidents and confrontations between McCullough and young men police believe are drug dealers . The tension culminated last Feb. 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded him in his front yard , shouting " Kill the snitch . " <p> Some residents say the street is quieter in part because homeowners and police shut down several drug houses in the neighborhood . Others credit a new staff at a nearby recreation center for driving away loiterers and welcoming young children . But many agree that McCullough 's stand made the biggest impact . <p> Milton Simpkins , a 30-year resident of the street , says McCullough " is the best thing that ever happened for this block . " <p> Police said there has been only a modest drop in crime on 59th Street , but they said there has been a huge improvement in the quality of life . Clusters of young men no longer hang out in the street at all hours of the day . Residents are out and about . And the neighborhood has found a new sense of pride . <p> " The atmosphere has completely changed , " said Lt. Lawrence Green , who oversaw police patrols in North Oakland for five years until he was transferred to the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 59th Street or the surrounding area is pristine . It 's not . But you can really see an improvement on Patrick 's street . " <p> McCullough became an unlikely hero on a rainy night as he walked from his front door to his car . As usual , a group of young men hung around on the sidewalk . He told them to get off his property . <p> Just what happened next remains in some dispute . McCullough , who had a handgun in his pocket , said that he was surrounded by the men and that one of them hit him with a branch . <p> McCullough said Melvin McHenry reached for a gun in a friend 's waistband . McCullough shot him . <p> " I did n't want to shoot him , " McCullough recalled . " But at that point , I did what I had to do . " <p> The bullet wounded Melvin in the side and arm . Neither McCullough nor Melvin was charged with a crime . <p> McCullough , 50 , who labored nearly alone for more than 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the strange position of being hailed as a hero by many people , including Mayor Jerry Brown and activists working to clean up crime-ridden areas of Oakland . <p> " Celebrity is lasting more than 15 minutes , " McCullough said . " I 'm now used to  --  and really enjoy  --  strangers calling me by name , waving from passing cars , chatting with me about crime and safety when I 'm on BART , out with the family , in a grocery store or at a gas station . " <p> But critics , including some who held a small rally on his street in April to denounce the shooting , compared him to New York subway shooter Bernhard Goetz or the vigilante made famous by actor Charles Bronson in the " Death Wish " movies . <p> Melvin and his mother , Stacy Hegler , found their lives changed , too . Although they have some ardent defenders , they are outnumbered by detractors who vilified Melvin after the shooting and said he and his friends exemplify everything wrong with Oakland . <p> They 've since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's insurance company . Hegler did not return phone calls from The Chronicle , but shortly after the shooting she said , " He nearly killed my son and almost ruined our lives . " <p> Melvin , for his part , has little to say about the incident . <p> " I do n't want to talk about that snitch , " he said Thursday . <p> Melvin , now 16 , said he has changed schools twice since the shooting and still worries about McCullough coming after him . " My life is in the hands of God . I 'm moving on . What happened back there is history . He can say whatever . I 'm done with that . " <p> But it is hard to deny the profound changes seen in the past year on 59th Street and adjacent Bushrod Park . Everyone  --  even critics of McCullough  --  agrees it is mellower than it has been for years . <p> " Things are a lot quieter on the street now , and I think the park has definitely improved , " said Elizabeth Hutchinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four children for six years . " I do n't approve of vigilantism , and I was really upset when he shot the kid  --  I still think he is wrong . I do n't think that 's the way to make a street safer . " <p> But , she said , " I 'm happy that our street is quieter . " <p> Even before the shooting , changes were afoot on 59th Street and at Bushrod Recreation Center and Park . Residents had complained that few programs were offered and that its staff did little to chase away the drug dealers . After a city report in 2004 deemed Bushrod the city 's worst-rated recreation center , the city hired a new staff . <p> Now , instead of empty 40-ounce beer bottles , crack pipes and cigarette butts , the children 's playground is filled with kids . The center offers more classes , trying to draw people from the immediate neighborhood and more upscale locales in the nearby Rockridge and Temescal districts . McCullough even feels comfortable shooting hoops there with his son , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're really trying to give this park back to the community , " Bonnie Lacy Washington , head of the newly formed Bushrod Advisory Council , said as she watched teens play basketball there Thursday night . " For years , people shied away from this park during the day , and at night it was a war zone . No one would think of coming to a meeting at the center . " <p> The other big change came when police and citizens shut down several nearby drug houses . In one case , the owner sold her home and moved after a group of residents was awarded $45,000 in damages in a nuisance suit . In March , another homeowner put up a new fence to keep people from hanging around her property after residents videotaped drug deals as part of a similar lawsuit . <p> Some said McCullough 's shooting of Melvin was little more than incidental to the neighborhood . <p> " Patrick 's shooting was a nonevent in the evolution of the street , " said Tom Nemeth , a real estate agent who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes are because of the drug dealers moving and the changes at the park . Those two things are really what changed 59th Street . <p> " This neighborhood was coming up anyway . These events just moved things along , " said Nemeth , who is selling a home on 59th Street for $600,000 . " This used to be one of the worst blocks in Oakland . Now it 's just another block : not the best or the worst . " <p> But people who live on 59th Street see it differently . They attribute the changes to McCullough 's taking a stand and the city 's response afterward . <p> " This area has been a drug zone on and off since crack came around in the 1980s , " said Simpkins , the man who has lived on 59th Street for 30 years . " Most of us minded our own business . But Patrick has really changed everyone 's attitude . I believe Patrick McCullough is the best thing that ever happened for this block . " <p> Perhaps underscoring how much safer residents feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he  --  like many others  --  insisted that his last name not be published out of fear the drug dealers might retaliate . But he no longer fears retribution . <p> After the shooting , Green and other police officers urged the McCullough family to move . Patrick thought it was a good idea and called some Realtors , but his wife resisted . He came home one day to find his wife had put a banner in their front window reading , " I AM NOT MOVING . " <p> " I did n't want someone else  --  especially those thugs out there  --  to govern my life , " Daphne McCullough said . " I want my family to live on a block that does n't have bunch of drug dealers hanging around all day , drinking beer and shooting dice . Is that too much to ask ? " <p> On Friday , Patrick McCullough and his wife sent an e-mail to friends and supporters telling them of their plans to build an addition to their two-bedroom home that will nearly double its size . <p> " Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hours ' rest per day brought me near exhaustion , " McCullough wrote . " My main goal the past year has been maintaining normalcy for the family . Of course , the new normal took a bit of getting used to . " ( 1 ) Patrick McCullough is more at ease walking the street these days ; last year he was reluctant to leave his house because of alleged drug dealers he says threatened him. , ( 2 ) The McCulloughs have mounted a camera to monitor activity in their neighborhood . / Photos by Paul Chinn / The Chronicle , MAP : / The Chronicle
