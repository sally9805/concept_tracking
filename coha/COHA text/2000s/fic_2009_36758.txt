Night Swimming <p> Not halfway there and yet her shoulders tingled with fatigue . Going out was always a fight , the incoming Atlantic shoving her back , impeding her progress . Sloan swam slowly , methodically , one stroke following the next in perfect rhythm with a head turn and measured breath in between . Pier lights appeared from behind a jetty and she stopped , treading water , triangulating herself against the faint illumination of home . <p> An occasional figure moved on the beach , dark against the lights rising behind dunes . Tonight she had n't worried that her mother might see her drop her clothes to the sand . Her parents were at a charity benefit in support of a cure for some disease or another . They were always attending these events even though her father grumbled . But her mother was poised for the next illness or disaster , always extending her checkbook to those less fortunate . Sloan had come to question her mother 's commitment to these causes . Somehow , her actions appeared desperate at times rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left , Sloan 's father in his worn tuxedo and her mother in a rose-colored dress , understated as always . A string of inherited pearls encircled her delicate neck . But her parents seemed somehow out of kilter in their evening attire with the summer sun bright on their shoulders . It was the gentleness of his hand against her back as he helped her into the car when only moments before they had argued . This particular argument was the same as always-money , work , the pressure of social obligations . <p> They seemed at a truce when they left . Sloan stood on the screened-in porch watching them pull away , the oyster-shell drive popping under the car 's tires . Ocean breeze fingered her hair while a lump of dread formed in her stomach . Sloan had come to anticipate this emptiness , the sensation of a roller coaster hung at the bottom sweep of a drop , pressing down , never leveling out . <p> She was nearly ill with this sinking feeling at times , but she could never pinpoint why . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her SAT scores or even her total lack of social life . When that vacant sensation crawled in her stomach she gravitated to the beach . It was an odd impulse that had made her wade into the dark water the first time . <p> She had n't meant to go so far . She knew better , but she walked forward into the waves until she was gently lifted , her tenuous connection with solid earth dissolved . She had floated there , her arms moving listlessly , barely enough to keep her head above soft swells , knowing an undertow could carry her to sea . <p> But she had sensed the tide was coming in and she had been correct on that all-important account . The current caught her up and swept her along parallel to the beach . At the northern tip of the island she was pushed inland where the water squeezed into the creek behind their home . There she was deposited on the steps of their dock as if the hand of a god had laid her there . She crawled into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their lives , the watercraft was inherited from her great-grandfather , a once regal thing grown shabby under her father 's watch . <p> Stars had been distinct that moonless night as she tiptoed down the dry planks of the slender walk from the dock . Palmetto fronds clacked and marsh grass shushed as she sneaked toward her back door . Inside , her parents dozed on the sofa , a movie playing soft blue against their faces . <p> She had remained careful since then , checking the weathered tide chart on the storage shed door to make sure of the water 's movement before she ventured into the surf-a calculated risk . She was a strong swimmer . Her mother had made sure of that , hauling Sloan and her little sister to lessons at the YMCA for years , until Sloan had flatly refused to go another chlorine-stinging lap . <p> Her mother would have a meltdown if she knew Sloan was out at night , swimming into the distance , leaving her younger sister alone in the house . She 'd be grounded for a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Still , Sloan craved the heart-pounding adrenaline from this secret endeavor , a feeling far preferable to the palpitations of anxiety and dread that came upon her so naturally . She felt wild and independent knowing she could slowly drift to the black below or be attacked by a rogue shark . Everyone would wonder what had happened to her . Was she kidnapped ? A runaway ? There would be headlines in the Pawleys Island Gazette - " Local teen disappears , worst feared . " <p> Gauging her level of exhaustion as moderate , Sloan started toward shore . She 'd make it . She always did . Today was not her day to die . She struggled on . The journey back was always easier , as if the world were behind her pushing her home . <p> Twenty minutes later her feet found sandy purchase and she stumbled onto the beach so limp it was impossible for her to feel any emotion , except perhaps relief that she had survived once again . <p> Soreness would grip her muscles the next few days , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion , over herself . Her mother would comment that her moody nature had ebbed . Her grades would improve . She would be at peace for a time . <p> It was not the death-defying act that buoyed her but the clandestine nature of it that was her companion . I have a secret , she would think to herself over the next few weeks when she quarreled with her mother or struggled with calculus . I 'm strong . I 'm a survivor . <p> Chapter Two Island Life <p> Emmett Sullivan pressed open the hatch to the widow 's walk atop his house . His golf shirt billowed in the rush of salty air as he climbed the last few ladder rungs and stepped into a 360-degree view . The Atlantic tumbled in on the east side of the island . To the west , the creek was placid , the marsh grass still and straight . Only a cat's-paw ripple in the channel betrayed the current below where the incoming tide married the creek . Here at the northern tip , a wide sandbar tightly packed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was healthy compared to the southern end , where the clockwise motion of the Atlantic chewed away the island 's sandy fringe and depleted the creek . <p> Emmett scanned the beach for his daughters ' bright bathing suits . They were in their usual spot , away from the grip of undertow between islands but close enough to be seen from the widow 's walk . <p> He clicked the walkie-talkie . " Sloan , it 's Dad . " <p> One of the tiny people on the sand below moved . A moment later , he heard his older daughter 's bored tone crackle to life in his hand . <p> " Yeah , I 'm here . " <p> " Your mother says it 's time to come in . " <p> Sloan motioned to Ainslie and began cramming things into a bag . Ainslie , true to form , ignored her sister , enthralled with something in a tidepool , probably crab holes or a starfish . Emmett knew how things would transpire . Ainslie would ignore her sister . Sloan would practically drag her to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in that universal sardonic teenager tone , how much she hated having to baby-sit , AGAIN . <p> The girls trudged back , lugging buckets and bags . Sloan wore her straw hat and Jackie-O glasses . She was no doubt slathered from head to toe in sunscreen in her battle to stave the freckles that sprinkled her mother 's skin . Then there was Ainslie , his sun-drop baby , all nut brown skin , dark eyes and hair just like Emmett 's before the gray invaded . Emmett could relate to his nine-year-old 's desire to stay out all day . His own childhood had been spent in similar pursuits on this island , he and his brothers wading tidal creeks and crawling sand dunes from first light to dark . <p> The girls left the hard-packed beach for the loose sand of a path that snaked between dunes . The sand pulled at their steps , their flip-flops kicking up sprays of granules behind them . They worked their way through gnarled cedars , a stand of only a dozen or so trees . When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low-slung and hardy from weathering storms . Emmett and his brothers hacked through them , cleared secret rooms in their dense branches . <p> Their mother banished them from the house each day until supper , so Emmett followed Rick and Judd around the island . They rode bikes the three miles down to the public beach at the island 's southern end where new , pale girls in bikinis appeared each week . They hung out with locals who leaned over the creek bridge , fishing poles tailing line into rippled waters , buckets and coolers smelly with flounder and spot . At low tide , the boys dug oysters and clams . They came home with split fingers and a sack of jagged bivalves . <p> They shed their cut-off high-tops in a muddy heap outside , hung their stinky shirts and shorts on the clothesline and showered in the changing area under the house . The shower stung their skin with sweet prickles of pain and washed rank pluff in a gurgle down the drain . They ran up the back stairs in the buff , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they streaked through the kitchen . A few days later their clothes would appear , fragrant and folded , in their chests of drawers . <p> Emmett often lamented that his girls would never know the luxury of being kicked out and free to roam . Lauren kept a close eye on them-they were never unaccounted for , never left to their own meanderings , particularly Ainslie , who was still a baby in so many ways . But Ainslie was tough , athletic , and energetic . Emmett wished Lauren would let her join the other kids who explored the island on bikes and slender scooters . Often Emmett thought Ainslie should have been born a boy ; perhaps then her mother might have cut her some slack . But to Lauren , girls were supposed to be pink bows , tea parties , and piano recitals . <p> Poor Lauren had struck out with both girls in that respect . Where Ainslie was rambunctious , Sloan was introverted and somewhat dark of nature . She had inherited his family 's artistic talents but also a more brooding , sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a certain look Emmett could see contempt , so bald and honest it seared his soul . She apparently found him incompetent , but then the girl would roll her eyes and he would convince himself it was only puberty talking . <p> He could feel the girls rattle into the house , but up this high , wind smothered most of their noise . He sensed water running in their bathroom beneath him . He reclined against the bench and scanned the horizon of startling orange burn pooling over the mainland , its reflection quivering in the creek . Out to sea , the sky was licked with lavender like the heavens of a Renaissance painting . <p> " Want some company ? " Lauren appeared at the hatch . Wind whipped her blonde bob in a frenzied dance . She held a glass in both hands . " I come bearing gifts . " <p> " Please join me . " <p> He took the gin and tonics from her outstretched hands . She climbed up and slid onto the bench opposite him . <p> " I assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , and the distinct taste of juniper and lime tingled his nose . <p> " Sloan 's supposed to be helping her wash up , but I heard the TV on . I think they 're watching Titanic for the forty-fifth time , " she said and sighed dramatically . " It 's pretty up here tonight . " <p> " We always have the best sunsets in the fall . " <p> " Have you heard when they 're going to start dredging the creek ? " <p> " Spring , I hope . The channel has to be opened up again or we wo n't be able to get the boat out . " <p> " Mom ? " Sloan 's frustrated voice floated up to them . <p> " What now ? " Lauren leaned over the opening and yelled , " I 'll be down in a minute . " Then to Emmett she said , " Well , I guess I need to go stir the soup anyway . " <p> " What are we having ? " <p> " She crab . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder , grasping the rungs with one hand while she balanced her drink in the other . <p> Emmett sucked down the rest of his cocktail and tossed the ice cubes onto the sharply pitched roof . He watched as they rolled down and bounced off where the curlicued fatade poked above the gabled roofline of his funny house , the only Victorian on Pawleys . When his grandfather built it in the 1920s , locals had hated the giant burgundy , blue , and green house . Now it was considered a landmark , a house locals advised tourists not to miss . <p> Emmett Layton Sullivan Sr. bought this northern part of the island as a family get-a-way and erected an exact replica of his house on Cape May . Shortly thereafter , Victorians started popping up in nearby Georgetown , but there was never another frosted cake house on the island . The houses served as the logo for his grandfather 's company , Painted Lady Greeting Cards . His brother Judd lived in the New Jersey house now and was CEO of the company . Rick was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stayed behind , married a Lowcountry girl , become a landscape architect . Along with his brothers , Emmett had inherited this house . His end of the deal was upkeep and taxes , both of which escalated each year . Lauren had been so enamored of the house that Emmett continued to tease her that she 'd married him for real estate . They had both envisioned the many rooms overflowing with a large family . But now their home was a money pit , a hulking house of deterioration that would have served a larger family well , but which seemed empty with only their two children padding the halls . <p> Emmett backed down the ladder and pulled the hatch closed with a final swish of air . Before he could get it latched Ainslie was calling for him , drawing her words out long and pleading , " Daaaadeeee . Daaaadeeee . " <p> He pressed his palm against a bumper sticker on her bedroom door that read , Lights out ! Turtles dig the dark . <p> " Watch out . Here I come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door ajar and stomped into her room . Ainslie squealed and jerked away from Sloan , who was struggling to pull pajamas over her sister 's wet legs . Posters of frogs , snakes , and butterflies were stuck at odd angles along the walls . An entire bookcase was given over to prized seashells , contorted driftwood , and smelly bits of coral . Ocean musk came from the bank of aquariums housing the luckless creatures Ainslie plucked from the beach . <p> " You do this , Dad . I ca n't get her to sit still , " Sloan said . " She 's old enough to put on her own p.j.s anyway . Y'all just baby her . " <p> " Go on . I 'll take care of her . " Emmett raised his arms over his head and swayed into the room like Frankenstein . " Get those pajamas on . I 'm the daddy monster who gobbles up little girls who do n't have on pajamas . Aarrgghhh ! " <p> " Oh , no . Oh , no . " Ainslie jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm good ! You ca n't eat me ! " <p> " No ? " He stopped and turned his head as if thinking . " But I 'm still hungry . Maybe I 'll just GOBBLE YOU UP ANYWAY ! " He stomped to the bed , grabbed her ankles , and dragged her toward him . <p> " No , Daddy ! Do n't eat me . " She gasped around gulps of laughter . " Do n't ! " <p> He buried his face in her soft tummy . " Yum . Yum . Yum . " <p> " I 'm not sweet ! I 'm not ! " <p> " Yum . Yum . Yum . " <p> Emmett stopped . Ainslie was still slick from her bath and Emmett 's fingers moved smoothly over her abdomen . He could discern a distinct mass below her ribcage . <p> " Ainslie , does this hurt ? " <p> " Get me , Daddy ! " <p> " No . Stop a minute . This spot right here . Does it hurt ? " She calmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How long has this been here ? " <p> " I do n't know . Get me , Daddy . " <p> " Stay right there . " He walked to the top landing of the stairs and yelled down for Lauren . <p> " What ? " she called up . <p> " I need you to look at something on Ainslie . " <p> She came to the bottom of the stairs , a tea towel in her hands . <p> " What is it ? " <p> " Did you know she has a lump in her stomach ? " <p> " No . " Lauren 's forehead wrinkled . She draped the towel over the banister and took the stairs two at a time . Ainslie lay still , her arms above her head , her top bunched up against her neck . Her innocent eyes moved from her mother 's face to her father 's and back as they poked her stomach . <p> " Right here , " he said , moving his fingers over the firm lump . <p> Lauren touched her gingerly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long has this been here ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " Does it hurt ? " <p> " No . " <p> Lauren pulled the pajama top down slowly and said in a forced , cheerful voice , " You hungry , baby ? " <p> " Yes ! Yes ! " Ainslie said . " I 'm starving . " <p> " Good . Go tell your sister it 's time to eat . " <p> Ainslie bounced off the bed and ran into her sister 's room . <p> " What is it ? " Emmett whispered . <p> " I do n't know . You get on the Internet and see what you can find . I 'll call the doctor 's office and leave a message . I 'm taking her in first thing in the morning .
