It will feature Carolyn Valentine , Jarrad Holbrook and Suzanne Favette . <p> The button-pusher is " This Is How It Goes , " by Neil LaBute , who brutally ( how else ? ) tackles racism , adultery and deception . That one has Scott McLean , Tyee Tilghman and Emily Paton Davies . <p> " The Glass Menagerie " will star Stricker , Martha Harmon Pardee , Barbra Andrews and Josh Hartwell .
