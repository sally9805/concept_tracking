<p> It stands off Exit 16W of the New Jersey Turnpike , in the shadow of New York City , as a shrine to some great and memorable football . It conjures visions of wind-swept fall and winter days when Bill Parcells coached the New York Giants with Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor , in games with NFC East titles and Super Bowl berths at stake . It spawned non-football legends as well , like the one about Jimmy Hoffa being buried beneath an end zone . <p> But 30-year-old Giants Stadium also is a monument to something else : financial mediocrity for its two NFL occupants . The Giants and New York Jets , despite playing in the media capital of the world , rank in the middle of the league 's pack in revenues , having been far surpassed by franchises  --  such as the Washington Redskins  --  with more aggressive approaches and newer stadiums that tap into lucrative revenue streams . <p> Now the Giants and Jets are trying to do something about that , with plans to open a privately financed , approximately $1.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teams among the most profitable in the sport . <p> There 's a problem , however : The project hinges on approval by the league 's owners of a $300 million loan from the NFL 's stadium subsidy fund . And other owners are making the Giants and Jets sweat out that approval in the aftermath of the bitter fight between high- and low-revenue teams last winter and spring that preceded the owners ' approval of a labor and revenue-sharing settlement . <p> " I do n't know what 's going to happen , " the owner of one small-market NFL franchise said last week . " People are saying they wo n't vote for it . But sometimes clubs say one thing and then vote the other way . " <p> The owner spoke on the condition of anonymity , not wanting to be viewed as publicly restarting the tussle between high- and low-revenue teams . Other owners and club executives contacted in recent weeks spoke about the issue on the same condition . It 's a highly sensitive topic these days , with Commissioner Roger Goodell likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $300 million request by the Giants and Jets . The request needs to be approved by at least 24 of the 32 teams . Supporters of the project think the request will be approved but would n't want to wager money on it , and they do n't want to say anything publicly that might jeopardize ratification . <p> The prevailing view leaguewide also seems to be that the request likely will be approved but with griping by low-revenue clubs still upset over the terms of the labor and revenue-sharing deals . Even opponents of the $300 million request concede that 's the probable outcome . Still , there 's enough lingering resentment in the high-revenue/low-revenue divide that rejection is not completely out of the question . <p> " People are asking , ' Why should I fund this project that will be an ATM machine for those two teams ? ' " an executive from one low-revenue club said . " If you form a block and force approval of a labor deal that gives everything to the players , do n't turn around and expect us to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take people at what they 're saying , the thing does n't happen . But I 'm done trying to predict what happens when the owners get into a room to vote . " <p> Requests by teams for grants from the league 's G-3 stadium loan program usually are relatively routine . Goodell 's predecessor , Paul Tagliabue , made stadium construction a top priority and wanted the league to be a business partner with teams and their communities in the projects . The G-3 program , run cooperatively by the league and the NFL Players Association , was put in place in 1999 , and 10 teams have received loans to build or renovate stadiums . <p> But previous subsidies were limited to $150 million per project . The Giants and Jets are asking for $300 million because they decided to combine on a stadium project after the Jets were unable to secure public funding for a proposed stadium on the West Side of Manhattan . Supporters of this project say the request is reasonable because two teams are involved , even if it 's only one stadium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it that way , " Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said at an owners ' meeting last month in New Orleans . <p> But other owners are wary of the size of the G-3 request , saying that approval of the loan for the New York stadium project and of another pending request by the Kansas City Chiefs basically would empty the G-3 fund . There are deeper issues with the request by the Giants and Jets , though . <p> The owners voted 30 to 2 in March to approve the labor and revenue-sharing settlement , with only the Buffalo Bills ' Ralph Wilson and the Cincinnati Bengals ' Mike Brown opposing the deal . The labor deal expanded the pool of revenues from which NFL players are paid under the salary cap system , giving the players 59 percent of total football revenues . The revenue-sharing accord provides for increased payments from high-revenue teams to low-revenue clubs . But some owners of lower-revenue franchises continue to maintain that even the bolstered revenue-sharing plan is not sufficient to offset what they view as excessive player costs under the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one-for-all financial model  --  the teams share national television revenues equally  --  continues to struggle with concerns about the growing revenue disparities between franchises , when owners such as Jones and the Redskins ' Daniel Snyder have found ways to tap into unshared revenue sources such as luxury suites and local sponsorships . <p> The Giants and Jets , for now , are not among the most affluent franchises . In the latest annual ranking by Forbes magazine of NFL franchise values , the Giants were ranked 15th with an estimated worth of $890 million and the Jets were 19th at $876 million . The magazine estimated the values of five franchises at more than $1 billion , led by the Redskins at $1.4 billion . The estimated annual revenues of the two New York clubs  --  $182 million for the Giants and $179 million for the Jets  --  lag far behind the Redskins ' league-leading total of $303 million . <p> But that would change with a new stadium in the New York area . Estimates say that the new facility would produce about $100 million in additional revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The additional revenues largely would be from sources , such as luxury suites , that the Giants and Jets would not have to share with other NFL teams . But those revenues would count toward the total football revenues pool on which the salary cap is based , so the player costs for the other clubs would increase by an estimated $2 million per team annually . Some other teams thus view themselves as being asked to fund a project that will have a direct financial benefit only for the Giants , the Jets and the players . Under the G-3 program , the bulk of a loan for a stadium is repaid from the visiting teams ' share of club seat receipts . <p> " It 's a tremendous increase in unshared revenue , " an executive from a higher-revenue team said . " It 's always that way with a new stadium . What 's different about this is that because it 's the New York market , the numbers are so extraordinarily large . And we 'd be tapping out the G-3 fund . " <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the stadium project even without the $300 million subsidy from the league . But that would involve increased financial risks for the teams , and representatives of both clubs informed the other owners at the New Orleans meeting that they 're not prepared to do that . <p> There are compelling arguments in favor of ratification of the $300 million request . Supporters say it behooves the league to have a showcase stadium in New York . Teams do n't like to reject G-3 requests because they might , one day , have one of their own pending . And the late Giants owner Wellington Mara , father of current club president and chief executive John Mara , was one of the most revered figures in league history , once agreeing to surrender the heftier share of the league 's TV rights that a New York franchise could command in favor of having a balanced , competitive league . <p> " Ultimately , " the executive from the higher-revenue team said , " I think it 'll go through .
