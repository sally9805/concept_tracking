Chapter One Toms River , across the Barnegat Bay , teems out ahead of me in the blustery winds and under the high autumnal sun of an American Thanksgiving Tuesday . From the bridge over from Sea-Clift , sunlight diamonds the water below the girdering grid . The white-capped bay surface reveals , at a distance , only a single wet-suited jet-skier plowing and bucking along , clinging to his devil machine as it plunges , wave into steely wave . " Wet and chilly , bad for the willy , " we sang in Sigma Chi , " Dry and warm , big as a baby 's arm . " I take a backward look to see if the NEW JERSEY 'S BEST KEPT SECRET sign has survived the tourist season-now over . Each summer , the barrier island on which Sea-Clift sits at almost the southern tip hosts six thousand visitors per linear mile , many geared up for sun ' n fun vandalism and pranksterish grand theft . The sign , which our Realty Roundtable paid for when I was chairman , has regularly ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up in New Brunswick . Today , I 'm happy to see it 's where it belongs . New rows of three-storey white-and-pink condos line the mainland shore north and south . Farther up toward Silver Bay and the state wetlands , where bald eagles perch , the low pale-green cinder-block human-cell laboratory owned by a supermarket chain sits alongside a white condom factory owned by Saudis . At this distance , each looks as benign as Sears . And each , in fact , isa good-neighbor clean- industry-partner whose employees and executives send their kids to the local schools and houses of worship . Management puts a stern financial foot down on drugs and pedophiles . Their campuses are well landscaped and policed . Both stabilize the tax base and provide locals a few good yuks . From the bridge span I can make out the Toms River yacht basin , a forest of empty masts wagging in the breezes , and to the north , a smooth green water tower risen behind the husk of an old nuclear plant currently for sale and scheduled for shutdown in 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boro of Sea-Clift , and frankly it is a positivist 's version of what landscape-seascape has mostly become in a multi-use society . This morning , I 'm driving from Sea-Clift , where I 've abided the last eight years , across the sixty-five-mile inland trek over to Haddam , New Jersey , where I once lived for twenty , for a day of diverse duties-some sobering , some fearsome , one purely hopeful . At 12:30 , I 'm paying a funeral-home visitation to my friend Ernie McAuliffe , who died on Saturday . At four , my former wife , Ann Dykstra , has asked to " meet " me at the school where she works , the prospect of which has ignited piano-wire anxiety as to the possible subjects-my health , her health , our two grown and worrisome children , the surprise announcement of a new cavalier in her life ( an event ex-wives feel the need to share ) . I also mean to make a quick stop by my dentist 's for an on-the-fly adjustment to my night guard ( which I 've brought ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hopeful part . Sponsors is a network of mostly central New Jersey citizens-men and women-whose goal is nothing more than to help people ( female Sponsors claim to come at everything from a more humanistic/nurturing angle , but I have n't noticed that in my own life ) . The idea of Sponsoring is that many people with problems need nothing more than a little sound advice from time to time-not problems you 'd visit a shrink for , or take drugs to cure , or that requires a program Blue Cross would co-pay . Just something you ca n't quite figure out by yourself , and that wo n't exactly go away , but that if you could just have a common-sense conversation about , you 'd feel a helluva lot better . A good example would be that you own a sailboat but are n't sure how to sail it very well . And after a while you realize you 're reluctant even to get in the damn thing for fear of sailing it into some rocks , endangering your life , losing your investment and embittering yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry dock at Brad 's Marina in Shark River , suffering subtle structural damage from being out of the water too long , and you 're becoming the butt of whispered dumb-ass-novice cracks and slurs by the boatyard staff . You end up never driving down there even when you want to , and instead find yourself trying to avoid ever thinking about your sailboat , like a murder you committed decades ago and have escaped prosecution for by moving to another state and adopting a new identity , but that makes you feel ghastly every morning at four o'clock when you wake up covered with sweat . Sponsor conversations address just such problems , often focusing on the debilitating effects of ill-advised impulse purchases or bad decisions regarding property or personal services . As a realtor , I know a lot about these things . Another example would be how do you approach your Dutch housekeeper , Bettina , who 's stopped cleaning altogether and begun sitting in the kitchen all day drinking coffee , smoking , watching TV and talking on the telephone long-distance , but you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst case , send her packing . Sponsor advice would be what a friend would say : Get rid of the boat , or else take some private lessons at the yacht club next spring ; probably nothing 's all that wrong with it for the time being-these things are built to last . Or I 'll write out a brief speech for the Sponsoree to deliver to Bettina or leave in the kitchen , which , along with a healthy check , will send her on her way without fuss . She 's probably illegal and unhappy herself . Anybody with a feet-on-the-ground idea of what makes sense in the world can offer advice like this . Yet it 's surprising the number of people who have no friends they can ask sound advice from , and no capacity to trust themselves . Things go on driving them crazy even though the solution 's usually as easy as tightening a lug nut . The Sponsor theory is : We offer other humans the chance to be human ; to seek and also to find . No donations ( or questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Haddam is not at all unusual for me . Despite my last decade spent happily on the Shore , despite a new wife , new house , a new professional address-Realty-Wise Associates-despite a wholly reframed life , I 've kept my Haddam affiliations alive and relatively thriving . A town you used to live in signifies something-possibly interesting-about you : what you were once . And what you were always has its private allures and comforts . I still , for instance , keep my Haddam Realty license current and do some referrals and appraisals for United Jersey , where I know most of the officers . For a time , I owned ( and expensively maintained ) two rental houses , though I sold them in the late-nineties gentrification boom . And for several years , I sat on the Governor 's Board of the Theological Institute-that is , until fanatical Fresh Light Koreans bought the whole damn school , changed the name to the Fresh Light Seminary ( salvation through studied acts of discipline ) and I was invited to retire . I 've also kept my human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional standards are indexed to the tax base . And quite frankly , I often just find solace in the leaf-shaded streets , making note of this change or that improvement , what 's been turned into condos , what 's on the market at what astronomical price , where historical streets have been revectored , buildings torn down , dressed up , revisaged , as well as silently viewing ( mostly from my car window ) the familiar pale faces of neighbors I 've known since the seventies , grown softened now and re-charactered by time 's passage . Of course , at some unpredictable but certain moment , I can also feel a heavy curtain-closing sensation all around me ; the air grows thin and dense at once , the ground hardens under my feet , the streets yawn wide , the houses all seem too new , and I get the williwaws . At which instant I turn tail , switch on my warning blinkers and beat it back to Sea-Clift , the ocean , the continent 's end and my chosen new life- happy not to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , you might wonder ? The place you first see daylight , or the place you choose for yourself ? Or is it the someplace you just ca n't keep from going back to , though the air there 's grown less breathable , the future 's over , where they really do n't want you back , and where you once left on a breeze without a rearward glance ? Home ? Home 's a musable concept if you 're born to one place , as I was ( the syrup-aired southern coast ) , educated to another ( the glaciated mid-continent ) , then come full stop in a third-spending years finding suitable " homes " for others . Home may only be where you 've memorized the grid pattern , where you can pay with a check , where someone you 've already met takes your blood pressure , palpates your liver , slips a digit here and there , measures the angstroms gone off your molars bit by bit-in other words , where your primary care-givers await , their pale gloves already pulled on and snugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ad hoc business adviser and confidant to my realty associate Mike Mahoney , about whom some personal data would be noteworthy . Mike hails from faraway Gyangze , Tibet ( the real Tibet , not the one in Ohio ) , and is a five-foot-three-inch , forty-three-year-old realty dynamo with the standard Tibetan 's flat , bony-cheeked , beamy Chinaman 's face , gun-slit eyes , abbreviated arm length and , in his case , skint black hair through which his beige scalp glistens . " Mike Mahoney " was the " American " name hung on him by coworkers at his first U.S. job at an industrial-linen company in Carteret-his native name , Lobsang Dhargey , being thought by them too much of a word sandwich . I 've told him that one or the other-Mike Lobsang or Mike Dhargey-could be an interesting fillip for business . But Mike 's view is that after fifteen years he 's adjusted to Mike Mahoney and likes being " Irish . " He has , in fact , become a full-blooded , naturalized American-at the courthouse in Newark with four hundred others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magenta robe and sandals , sporting a yellow horn hat and blowing a ceremonial trumpet off the craggy side of Mount Qomolangma-which is often how I think of him , though he never did it . You 'd be right to say I never in a hundred years expected to have a Tibetan as my realty associate , and that New Jersey homebuyers might turn skittish at the idea . But at least about the second of these , what might be true is not . In the year and a half he 's worked for me , since walking through my Realty-Wise door and asking for a job , Mike has turned out to be a virtual lion of revenue generation and business savvy : unceasingly farming listings , showing properties , exhibiting cold-call tenacity while proving artful at coaxing balky offers , wheedling acceptances , schmoozing with buyers , keeping negotiating parties in the dark , fast-tracking loan applications and getting money into our bank account where it belongs . Which is n't to say he 's a usual person to sell real estate alongside of , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've become over the years and for some of the same reasons-neither of us minds being around strangers dawn to dusk , and nothing else seems very suitable . Yet I 'm aware some of my competitors smirk behind both our backs when they see Mike out planting Realty-Wise signs in front yards . And though occaisonally potential buyers experience a perplexed moment when a voice inside them shouts , " Wait . I 'm being shown a beach bungalow by a fucking Tibetan ! " - most clients come around soon enough to think of Mike as someone special who 's theirs , and get over his unexpected Asian-ness as I have , to the point they can treat him like any other biped . Looked at from a satellite circling the earth , Mike is not very different from most real estate agents , who often turn out to be exotics in their own right : ex-Concorde pilots , ex-NFL linebackers , ex-Jack Kerouac scholars , ex-wives whose husbands run off with Vietnamese au pairs , then wish to God they could come back , but are n't allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , never one you fully occupy , no matter how long you do it . You somehow always think of yourself as " really " something else . Mike started his strange life 's odyssey in the mid-eighties as a telemarketer for a U.S. company in Calcutta , where he learned to talk American by taking orders for digital thermocators and moleskin pants from housewives in Pompton Plaines and Bridgeton . And yet with his short gesturing arms , smiley demeanor and aggressively cheerful outlook he can seem and act just like a bespectacled little Adam's-appled math professor at Iowa State . And indeed , in his duties as a residential specialist , he 's comprehended his role as being a " metaphor " for the assimilating , stateless immigrant who 'll always be what he is ( particularly if he 's from Tibet ) yet who develops into a useful , purposeful citizen who helps strangers like himself find safe haven under a roof ( he told me he 's read around in Camus ) . Over the last year and a half , Mike has embraced his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp dresser , by fine- tuning a flat , accentless news-anchor delivery ( his voice sometimes seems to come from offstage and not out of him ) , by sending his two kids to a pricey private school in Rumson , by mortgaging himself to the gizzard , by separating from his nice Tibetan wife , driving a fancy silver Infiniti , never speaking Tibetan ( easy enough ) and by frequenting-and probably supporting-a girlfriend he has n't told me about . All of which is fine . My only real complaint with him is that he 's a Republican . ( Officially , he 's a registered Libertarian-fiscal conservative , social moderate , which makes you nothing at all . ) But he voted for numbskull Bush and , like many prosperous newcomers , stakes his pennant on the plutocrat 's principle that what 's good for him is probably good for all others-which as a world-view and in spite of his infectious enthusiasm , seems to rob him of a measure of inner animation , a human deficit I usually associate with citizens of the Bay Area , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
