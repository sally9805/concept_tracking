FIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT HAVE FORCED LAKE POWELL INTO A FULL-BLOWN RETREAT , HOW LUCKY CAN WE GET ? // When the gates of Glen Canyon Dam clamped shut on March 13 , 1963 , closing off the Colorado River and creating the sprawling flood that is Lake Powell , canyon country devotees considered it the single greatest tragedy in U.S. wilderness conservation history . For the desert 's protoenvironmentalist , Edward Abbey , it was nothing short of burying " the living heart " of the Southwest . As the towering sandstone walls , dramatic arches , and labyrinthine side canyons slipped beneath the Colorado , it looked like the marvels of Glen Canyon would be gone forever . But forever is a long time . For the past five years , a drought has managed what decades of activism could not : to drain Lake Powell to a level 136 feet below its highest watermark . It 's no longer news that drought has lowered lake levels , but what is striking is the magnitude of the drop and the spectacular sites it is opening up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot every four days , " says Christopher Peterson , 29 , executive director of the Glen Canyon Institute , a nonprofit organization that advocates the draining of Lake Powell . Barring any drastic change in weather , this trend , he says , will likely continue well into the future . This March , in fact , the sinking lake is expected to approach levels not seen for 42 years , dropping to the near-mystical elevation of 3,551 feet-the point at which several of the canyon 's most legendary sites will reemerge . To catch this dramatic unveiling requires three things : a key to the elevations of Glen Canyon 's iconic spots , a how-to guide for visiting them , and an Internet connection to monitor the levels of Lake Powell . We 've taken care of the first two ; you 're on your own to check the water levels and get out there . And you really need to get out there . " There are side canyons that are completely unexplored , " says Peterson . " It 's a chance to be the John Wesley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PICTURE : In 1998 ( top ) the San Juan arm of Lake Powell was at full pool ( 3,700 feet ) .

Then track the water level of Lake Powell ( posted daily ; on the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 's site : www.usbr.gov ) . If the water dips below your site 's elevation , pack your bags and go where no one has gone in 42 years . MAPPING BY LEVELS This map is the first of its kind and was created by combining current and pre-Lake Powell data to approximate the past , present , and projected water levels . All estimates are based on lake levels receding at the current rate . 3,700 feet : Lake Powell at full capacity .
