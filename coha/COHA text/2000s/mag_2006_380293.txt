I did n't know how much people hated television . This may be because whenever I walk into anyone 's house , they leave the TV on the entire time we 're talking . That may , upon reflection , be a subtle hint I 'm not catching . Still , I got some sense of how much they hated it when I left TIME to write for a sitcom . People thought I was selling out or too lazy for journalism or , like all good Americans , desperate to meet Ryan Seacrest . <P> But I did n't feel like I was selling out , since I 've always loved television , far more than I love movies . So last year I begged for a job writing for Crumbs , a new pilot I liked because it was about a family that lied about every facet of its members ' lives until the mom went crazy . Luckily , Crumbs wanted to hire me because , after eight years in journalism , I could be had cheap . This still did n't work out well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it up by plugging the show . It premieres this Thursday ! 9:30 p.m . E.T. ! ABC ! Jane Curtin ! Fred Savage ! William Devane ! Tell your friends with Nielsen boxes ! <P> On my first day at the new job , having absolutely no experience , I was panicked about the prospect of being sent off to write . So I was glad when our morning meeting stretched past the two-hour mark . But by 4 o'clock , after we had ordered lunch and eaten it around the conference table , I was a little freaked out . G-8 meetings do n't last that long . <P> That 's when Marco Pennette , the creator of the show , informed me this was n't a meeting . All sitcom writing , it turns out , is done by committee . One of the writers eventually says something that makes everybody laugh . Then Marco approves it , and a writers ' assistant , who sits at a nearby desk and never talks , types it into the script , which appears on huge TVs on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn , is exactly how Shakespeare wrote . <P> At the meetings , Marco asks us for ideas , and we bore him with personal stories that have nothing to do with any of the characters but serve as therapy for us . I have learned so much about my fellow writers ' demented parents and deceitful exes that I am certain when this ends none of us can be friends . After we 've wasted time on that , Marco gives us a really bad premise , such as an episode in which the mother-in-law comes . We all pretend it 's a good idea and spend most of the day figuring out funny stuff that our characters would do with a mother-in-law and whether Bea Arthur or Cloris Leachman would be funnier playing her . Our concepts are so bad that Marco eventually realizes what a horrible idea a mother-in-law episode would be . Then he yells , " Come on , guys , we have to get this ! Focus ! " <P> When we do finally come up with something , we spend another day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show to our studio , Touchstone , and then to ABC . They make improvements along the lines of asking " Could it be a Ukrainian baby instead of a Chinese baby ? " Then Marco sends the " writer " of the episode off to " write " the dialogue , although every line will be completely rewritten around the conference table .
