Dirty South Chapter One Sirens ai n't nothin ' but ghosts . They reach out every damn night , red and blue , white spotlight flashin ' ' cross your eyes as you sleep on that concrete floor patterned in blood and dirt . You covered in a torn yellow blanket that once hid your dead mamma for weeks . In its touch , you see a bit of her cold ear and the edge of that face you tried not to imagine while you kept goin ' to school , cuttin ' her las ' ten dollars in a hundred ways at Rob 's Party Store down on Claiborne . You remember ? Do n't you ? Back then , you hold your own in the Calliope yard , the ole CP-3 , and find your only friends are a mean-ass pit bull you call Henry and a little rottweiler with short legs you name Midget . Your mamma stay alive to you for weeks underneath that blanket . Through it all , she stay like she is ' cause that room do n't have no heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her own family live on the other side of the project . Y'all know Calliope  --  its own little galaxy in New Orleans . Findin ' your people on the other side is like shootin ' over to the moon . They long ago forgot about her . Do n't know you . Your daddy ai n't nothin ' but a word and the only future you see come from a box of Bally shoes you traded for two of your mamma 's rocks out in the yard . Henry and Midget backin ' you up like thugs in the rope-and-barbed-wire collars you made for them . A hundred windows covered in aluminum foil watchin ' you like eyes stand on the grassless ground . You take those shoes down to some fancy-ass shoppin ' mall by the Quarter . The dollar you spend on a streetcar is the last green you have . Ten minutes later , that worn box of shoes you was gon na return for a hundred dollars  --  like that man said  --  is dumped out on the street along with your ole mongrel ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do n't take that streetcar . You walk . All damned day . It 's a day from Calliope . It 's dark when you get back . You remember . You thinkin ' about it all tonight with the sirens and the spotlights and them ghostful sounds . It was Friday and Calliope was workin ' plenty down the cross streets . Strawberries ' heads bobbin ' in white men 's Lexuses and Hondas . Boys you once knew jacked up as hell , wide-eyed and watchin ' for drugheads to slow down and make that deal . Shit made out of flour and toilet water . Room a hotbox when you crawl up the fire escape . Television on , playin ' BET and Aaliyah . She on a sailboat but dead . Like your mamma . You can smell Mamma now and you want to shake her awake , have her find people she know but you do n't , to get somethin ' to eat . Your belly all swole up after four days without food . You hungry and you know you need it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ole man who you seen your mamma kneel before on the stairwell is smilin ' at you with a wrench in his hand . He tell you he hooked you up , but then he see your mamma , nothin ' but a hidden hump , and you duck under his arm as he walk back and puke on hisself . Five days out of juvie , you back with a forty-year-old woman callin ' herself your grandmamma . You only know her as a woman your mamma would see and turn the other way to spit . Your grandmamma do n't like you . Make you run around like you work for her , makin ' corner deals by the Stronger Hope Church . Bringin ' her weed pipe to her with copies of Jet and Star . But you got a place on a small couch next to your twelve-year-old uncle who has fits and drools on himself when he do n't take his pills . They got food , too . Cold Popeyes and cans of green things you ai n't never tasted . You gain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to go to school , and buy a dictionary , even though you do n't know most of the words in it . You want to be like the silver mask on the bus signs . Diabolical . He do n't have no eyes or a body , just a silver face . God ? You 'd heard about him comin ' from the Calliope and how he makin ' rhymes from all the words he know . Sometime when you on the corner , hearin ' your own beat and bounce in your head , rhymin ' for fifty cents for some hustler to smile , you see Dio 's face on a passin ' bus . He comin ' back . He 'll hear you . One night you find a white girl and you rob her with a knife you made from an oak tree splinter . Do n't feel bad . She 's pretty fucked up and lookin ' for some more shit to fill her head . You scare her good and she runs away . With that money , you start it all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always say . You buy a minimixer with a dual cassette made for a kid and a beat tape . You got a microphone about the size of your finger . But it 's all you need to make your own . It 's all you do . Sleep on Grandmamma 's couch , run her business , run her drugs a bit , and make them tapes . You sell them . They cost you a dollar at Rob 's ; you sell ' em for three . Pretty soon  --  we talkin ' weeks , man  --  you known . Calliope ai n't no galaxy ; it 's a planet . It 's your planet . You grabbin ' your toy and hittin ' Friday- and Saturday-night block parties and you eatin ' ...
