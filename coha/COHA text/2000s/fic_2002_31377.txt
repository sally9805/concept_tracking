Jessica Fitzpatrick woke up screaming , her heart pounding out a rhythm of terror . Fear was a living , breathing entity in the darkness of her room . The weight of it crushed her , held her helpless ; she was unable to move . She could taste it in her mouth , and feel it coursing through her bloodstream . Around her , the air seemed so thick that her lungs burned for oxygen . She knew something monstrous was stirring deep in the bowels of the earth . For a moment she lay frozen , her ears straining to hear the murmur of voices rising and falling , chanting words in an ancient tongue that should never be spoken . Red , glowing eyes searched through the darkness , summoning her , beckoning her closer . She felt the power of those eyes as they neared , focused on her , and came ever closer . Her own eyes flew open , the need to flee was paramount in her mind . The entire room lurched , flinging her from the narrow bunk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her nightmare and into the realization that they were not safe in their beds at home , but in the cabin of a wildly pitching boat in the middle of a ferocious storm . The craft , tossed from wave to powerful wave , was taking a pounding . Jessica scrambled to her feet , gripping the edge of the bunk as she dragged herself toward the two children , Tara and Trevor Wentworth , who clung together , their faces pale and frightened . Tara screamed , her terrified gaze locked on Jessica . Jessica managed to make it halfway to the twins before the next wild bucking sent her to floor again . " Trevor , get your life jacket back on this minute ! " She reached them by crawling on herhands and knees , and then curled a supporting arm around each of them . " Do n't be afraid , we 'll be fine . " The boat rose on a wave , teetered and slid fast , tossing the three of them in all directions . Salt water poured in a torrent onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering the floor with an inch of ice-cold water . Tara screamed , and clutched at her brother 's arm , desperately trying to help him buckle his life jacket . " It 's him . He 's doing this , he 's trying to kill us . " Jessica gasped , horrified . " Tara ! Nobody controls the weather . It 's a storm . Plain and simple , just a storm . Captain Long will get us safely to the island . " " He 's hideous . A monster . And I do n't want to go . " Tara covered her face with her hands and sobbed . " I want to go home . Please take me home , Jessie . " Jessica tested Trevor 's life jacket to make certain he was safe . " Do n't talk that way , Tara . Trev , stay here with Tara while I go see what I can do to help . " She had to shout to make herself heard in the howling wind and booming sea . Tara flung herself into Jessica 's arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just know it  --  we 're all going to die just like Mama Rita did . " Trevor wrapped his arms around his twin sister . " No , we 're not , sis , do n't cry . Captain Long has been in terrible storms before , lots of them , " he assured . He looked up at Jessica with his piercing blue eyes . " Right , Jessie ? " " You 're exactly right , Trevor , " she agreed . Jessica had a firm hold on the banister and began to make her way up the stairs to the deck . Rain fell in sheets ; black clouds churned and boiled in the sky . The wind rose to an eerie shriek . Jessica held her breath , watched as Long struggled to navigate the boat through the heavier waves , taking them ever closer to the island . It seemed the age-old struggle between man and nature . Slowly , through the sheets of rain , the solid mass of the island began to take shape . Salt water sprayed and foamed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore . She knew it was only the captain 's knowledge of the region and his expertise that allowed him to guide the craft to the dock in the terrible storm . The rain was pouring from the sky . The clouds were so black and heavy overhead that the night seemed unrelentingly dark . Yet Jessica caught glimpses of the moon , an eerie sight with the swirling black of the clouds veiling its light . " Let 's go , Jessie , " Captain Long yelled . " Bring up the kids and your luggage . I want you off this boat now . " The words were nearly lost in the ferocity of the storm , but his frantic beckoning was plain . She hurried , tossing Trevor most of the packs while she helped Tara up the stairs and across the slippery deck . Captain Long lifted Tara to the dock before aiding Trevor to shore . He caught Jessica 's arm in a tight grip and pulled her close so he could be heard . " I do n't like this  --  Jess , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're stuck . You know he is n't the most pleasant man . " " Do n't worry , " she patted his arm , her stomach churning . " I 'll call if we need you . Are you certain you do n't want to stay overnight ? " " I 'll feel safer out there , " he gestured toward the water . Jessica waved him off and turned to look up at the island while she waited to get her land legs back . It had been seven years since she 'd last been to the island . Her memories of it were the things of nightmares . Looking up toward the ridge , she half expected to see a fiery inferno , with red and orange flames towering to the skies , but there was only the black night and the rain . The house that once had sat at the top of the cliff overlooking the ocean was long gone , reduced to a pile of ashes . In the dark , the vegetation was daunting , a foreboding sight . The weak rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell across the ground , creating a strange , unnatural pattern . The island was wild with heavy timber and thick with brush ; the wind set the trees and bushes dancing in a macabre fashion . Naked branches bowed and scraped together with a grating sound . Heavy evergreens whirled madly , sending sharp needles flying through the air . Resolutely , Jessica took a deep breath and picked up her pack , handing Trevor a flashlight to lead the way . " Come on , kids , let 's go see your father . " The rain slashed down at them , drenching them , drops piercing like sharp icicles right through their clothes to their skin . Heads down , they began to trudge their way up the steep stone steps leading away from the sea toward the interior of the island where Dillon Wentworth hid from the world . Returning to the island brought back a flood of memories of the good times  --  her mother , Rita Fitzpatrick , landing the job as housekeeper and nanny to the famous Dillon Wentworth . Jessica had been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to appreciate the rising star , a musician who would take his place among the greatest recording legends . Dillon spent a great deal of his time on the road , touring , or in the studio , recording , but when he was home , he was usually with his children or hanging out in the kitchen with Rita and Jessica . She had known Dillon in the good times , during five years of incredible magic . " Jessie ? " Trevor 's young voice interrupted her reflection . " Does he know we 're coming ? " Jessica met the boy 's steady gaze . At thirteen , Trevor had to be well aware that if they had been expected , they would n't be walking by themselves in the dead of night in the middle of a storm . Someone would have met them by car on the road at the boathouse . " He 's your father , Trevor , and it 's coming up on Christmas . He spends far too much time alone . " Jessica slicked back her rain-wet hair and squared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And Dillon Wentworth had a responsibility to his children . He needed to look after them , to protect them . The twins did n't remember their father the way she did . He had been so alive . So handsome . So everything . His life had been magical . His good looks , his talent , his ready laugh and famous blue eyes . Everyone had wanted him . Dillon had lived his life in the spotlight , a white-hot glare of tabloids and television . Of stadiums and clubs . The energy , the power of Dillon Wentworth were astonishing , indescribable , when he was performing . He burned hot and bright on stage , a man with a poet 's heart and a devil 's talent when he played his guitar and sang with his edgy , smoky voice . But at home ... Jessica also remembered Vivian Wentworth with her brittle laugh and red , talon-tipped fingers . The glaze in her eyes when she was cloudy with drugs , when she was staggering under the effects of alcohol , when she flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frames . The slow , terrible descent into the madness of drugs and the occult . Jessica would never forget Vivian 's friends who visited when Dillon was n't there . The candles , the orgies , the chanting , always the chanting . And men . Lots of men in the Wentworth bed . Without warning , Tara screamed , turning to fling herself at Jessica , nearly knocking her off the stairs . Jessica caught her firmly , wrapping her arms around the girl and holding her close . They were both so cold they were shivering uncontrollably . " What is it , honey ? " Jessica whispered into the child 's ear , soothing her , rocking her , there on the steep stairs with the wind slashing them to ribbons . " I saw something , eyes glowing , staring at us . They were red eyes , Jess . Red , like a monster ... or a devil . " The girl shuddered and gripped Jessica harder . " Where , Tara ? " Jessica sounded calm even though her stomach was knotted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There , " Tara pointed without looking , keeping her face hidden against Jessica . " Through the trees , something was staring at us . " " There are animals on the island , honey , " Jessica soothed , but she was straining to see into the darkness . Trevor valiantly tried to shine the small circle of light toward the spot his twin had indicated , but the light could n't penetrate the pouring rain . " It was n't a dog , it was n't , Jessie , it was some kind of demon . Please take me home , I do n't want to be here . I 'm so afraid of him . He 's so hideous . " Jessica took a deep breath and let it out slowly , hoping to stay calm when she suddenly wanted to turn and run herself . There were too many memories here , crowding in , reaching for her with greedy claws . " He was scarred terribly in a fire , Tara , you know that . " It took effort to keep her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hates us so much he does n't ever want to see us . And I do n't want to see him . He murdered people . " Tara flung the bitter accusation at Jessica . The howling wind caught the words and took them out over the island , spreading them like a disease . Jessica tightened her grip on Tara , gave her a short , impatient shake . " I never want to hear you say such a terrible thing again , not ever , do you understand me ? Do you know why your father went into the house that night ? Tara , you 're too intelligent to listen to gossip and anonymous phone callers . " " I saw the papers . It was in all the papers ! " Tara wailed . Jessica was furious . Furious . Why would someone suddenly , after seven years , send old newspapers and tabloids to the twins ? Tara had innocently opened the package wrapped in a plain brown paper . The tabloids had been brutal , filled with accusations of drugs , jealousy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife in bed with another man , that there had been an orgy of sex , drugs , devil worship , and murder , had been far too titillating for the scandal sheets not to play it up long before the actual facts could come out . Jessica had found Tara sobbing pitifully in her room . Whoever had seen fit to enlighten the twins about their father 's past had called the house repeatedly whispering horrible things to Trevor and Tara , insisting their father had murdered several people including their mother . " Your father went into a burning house to save you kids . He thought you were both inside . Everyone who had gotten out tried to stop him , but he fought them , got away , and went into a burning inferno for you . That is n't hate , Tara . That 's love . I remember that day , every detail . " She pressed her fingers to her pounding temples . " I ca n't ever forget it no matter how much I try . " And she had tried . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vision of the black lights and candles . The scent of the incense . She remembered the shouting , the raised voices , the sound of the gun . And the flames . The terrible greedy flames . The blanket of smoke , so thick one could n't see . And the smells never went away . Sometimes she still woke up to the smell of burning flesh . Trevor put his arm around her . " Do n't cry , Jessica . We 're already here , we 're all freezing , let 's just go . Let 's have Christmas with Dad , make a new beginning , try to get along with him this time . " Jessica smiled at him through the rain and the tears . Trevor . So much like his father and he did n't even realize it . " We 're going to have a wonderful Christmas , Tara , you wait and see . " They continued up the stairs until the ground leveled out and Jessica found the familiar path winding through the thick timber to the estate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Canada , it was small and remote , no ferry even traveled to it . That was the way Dillon had preferred it , wanting privacy for his family on his own personal island . In the old days , there had been guards and dogs . Now there were shadows and haunting memories that tore at her soul . In the old days the island had been alive with people , bustling with activities ; now it was silent , only a caretaker lived somewhere on the island in one of the smaller houses . Jessica 's mother had told her that Dillon tolerated only one older man on his island on a regular basis . Even in the wind and rain , Jessica could n't help noticing the boathouse was ill-kept and the road leading around and up toward the house was overgrown , showing little use . Where there had always been several boats docked at the pier , none were in sight , although Dillon must still have had one in the boathouse . The path led through the thick trees . The wind was whipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rain had a much more difficult time penetrating through the treetops to reach them , but drops hitting the pathway plopped loudly . Small animals rustled in the bushes as they passed . " I do n't think we 're in Kansas anymore , " Trevor quipped , with a shaky smile . Jessica immediately hugged him to her . " Lions and tigers and bears , oh , my , " she quoted just to watch the grin spread across his face . " I ca n't believe he lives here . " Tara sniffed . " It 's beautiful during the day , " Jessica insisted , " give it a chance . It 's such a wonderful place . The island 's small , but it has everything . " They followed a bend , stumbling a little over the uneven ground . Trevor 's flashlight cast a meager circle of light on the ground in front of them , which only served to make the forest darker and more frightening as it surrounded them . " Are you certain you know the way , Jess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " I know this path with my eyes closed , " Jessica assured him . Which was n't exactly the truth . In the old days , the path had been well manicured and had veered off toward the cliff . This one was overgrown and led through the thick part of the forest toward the interior of the island , rising steadily uphill . " If you listen , you can hear the water rushing off to our left . The stream is large right now , but in the summer it is n't so strong or deep . There are ferns all along the bank . " She wanted to keep talking , hoping it would keep fear at bay . All three of them were breathing hard from the climb , and they paused to catch their breath under a particularly large tree that helped to shelter them from the driving rain . Trevor shined the light up the massive tree trunk and into the canopy , making light patterns to amuse Tara . As he whirled the light back down the trunk , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were standing . Jessica stiffened , jammed a fist in her mouth to keep from screaming , and yanked the flashlight from Trevor to shine it back to the spot he had accidentally lit up . For one terrible moment she could hardly breathe . She was certain she had seen someone staring at them . Someone in a heavily hooded long black cloak that swirled around the shadowy figure as if he were a vampire from one of the movies the twins were always watching . Whoever it was had been staring malevolently at them . He had been holding something in his hands that glinted in the flash of light . Her hand was shaking badly but she managed to find the place where he had been with the flashlight 's small circle of light . It was empty . There was nothing , no humans , no vampires in hooded cloaks . She continued to search through the trees , but there was nothing . Trevor reached out and caught her wrist , pulling her hand gently to him , taking the flashlight . " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked at them then , ashamed of showing such naked fear , ashamed the island could reduce to her to that terrified teenager she once had been . She had hoped for so much : to bring them all together , to find a way to bring Dillon back to the world . But instead she was hallucinating . That shadowy figure belonged in her nightmares , not in the middle of a terrible rainstorm . The twins were staring up at her for direction . Jessica shook her head . " I do n't know , a shadow maybe . Let 's just get to the house . " She pushed them ahead of her , trying to guard their backs , trying to see in front of them , on both sides . With every step she took , she was more convinced she had n't seen a shadow . She had n't been hallucinating . She was certain something , someone had been watching them . " Hurry , Trevor , I 'm cold , " she urged . As they topped the rise , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was huge , rambling , several stories high with round turrets and great chimneys . The original house had been completely destroyed in the fire and here , at the top of the rise , surrounded by timber , Dillon had built the house of his boyhood dreams . He had loved the Gothic architecture , the lines and carvings , the vaulted ceilings , and intricate passageways . She remembered him talking with such enthusiasm , spreading pictures on the counter in the kitchen for her and her mother to admire . Jessica had teased him unmercifully about being a frustrated architect and he had always laughed and replied he belonged in a castle or a palace , or that he was a Renaissance man . He would chase her around with an imaginary sword and talk of terrible traps in secret passageways . Rita Fitzpatrick had cried over this house , telling Jessica how Dillon had clung to his dreams of music and how he had claimed that having the house built was symbolic of his rise from the ashes . But at some point during Dillon 's months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agony of such terrible burns and after he realized that his life would never return to normal , the house had become for him , and all who knew him , a symbol of the darkness that had crept into his soul . Looking at it , Jessica felt fear welling inside her , a foreboding that Dillon was a very changed man . They stared at the great hulk , half expecting to see a ghost push open one of the shutters and warn them off . The house was dark with the exception of two windows on the third story facing them , giving the effect of two eyes staring back at them . Winged creatures seemed to be swarming up its sides . The mottled light from the moon lent the stone carvings a certain animation . " I do n't want to go in there , " Tara said , backing away . " It looks ... " she trailed off , slipping her hand into her brother 's . " Evil , " Trevor supplied . " It does , Jess , like one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it 's staring at us . " Jessica bit at her lower lip , glancing behind them , her gaze searching , wary . " You two have seen too many scary movies . No more for either of you . " The house looked far worse than anything she had ever seen in a movie . It looked like a brooding hulk , waiting silently for unsuspecting prey . Gargoyles crouched in the eaves , staring with blank eyes at them . She shook her head to clear the image . " No more movies , you 're making me see it that way . " She forced a small , uneasy laugh . " Mass hallucination . " " We 're a small mass , but it works for me , " there was a trace of humor in Trevor 's voice . " I 'm freezing ; we may as well go inside . " No one moved . They continued to stare up at the house in silence , at the strange animating effect of the wind and the moon on the carvings . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel her heart slamming hard in her chest . They could n't go back . There was something in the woods . There was no boat to go back to , only the wind and piercing rain . But the house seemed to stare at them with that same malevolence as the figure in the woods . Dillon had no inkling they were near . She thought it would be a relief to reach him , that she would feel safe , but instead , she was frightened of his anger . Frightened of what he would say in front of the twins . He would n't be pleased that she had n't warned him of their arrival , but if she had called , he would have told her not to come . He always told her not to come . Although she tried to console herself with the fact that his last few letters had been more cheerful and more interested in the twins , she could n't deceive herself into believing he would welcome them . Trevor was the first to move , patting Jessica on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the house . Tara followed him , and Jessica brought up the rear . At some point the area around the house had been landscaped , the bushes shaped , and beds of flowers planted , but it looked as though it had n't been tended in quite a while . A large sculpture of leaping dolphins rose up out of a pond on the far side of the front yard . There were statues of fierce jungle cats strewn about the wild edges of the yard , peering out of the heavier brush . Tara moved closer to Jessica , a small sound of alarm escaping her as they gained the slate walkway . All of them were violently shivering , their teeth were chattering , and Jessica told herself it was the rain and cold . They made it to within yards of the wraparound porch with its long thick columns when they heard it . A low , fierce growl welled up . It came out of the wind and rain , impossible to pinpoint but swelling in volume . Tara 's fingers dug into Jessica 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whimpered . Jessica could feel the child shivering convulsively . " We keep walking . Trevor , have your flashlight handy  --  you may need it to hit the thing over the head if it attacks us . " She continued walking toward the house , taking the twins with her , moving slowly but steadily , not wanting to trigger a guard dog 's aggressive behavior by running . The growl rose to a roar of warning . Lights unexpectedly flooded the lawn and porch , revealing the large German shepherd , head down , teeth bared , snarling at them . He stood in the thick brush just off the porch , his gaze focused on them as they gained the steps . The dog took a step toward them just as the front door was flung open . Tara burst into tears . Jessica could n't tell if they were tears of relief or fear . She embraced the girl protectively . " What the hell ? " A slender man with shaggy blond hair greeted them from the doorway . " Shut up , Toby , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my property , " another voice roared from inside the house . Jessica stared at the man in the doorway . " Paul ? " There was utter relief in her voice . Her shoulders sagged and suddenly tears burned in her own eyes . " Thank God you 're here ! I need to get the kids into a hot shower and warm them up immediately . We 're freezing . " Paul Ritter , a former band member and long-time friend of Dillon Wentworth , gaped at her and the twins . " My God , Jess , it 's you , all grown up . And these are Dillon 's children ? " He hastily stepped back to allow them entrance . " Dillon , we have more company . We need heat , hot showers , and hot chocolate ! " As wet as she was , Paul gathered Jessica in his arms . " I ca n't believe you three are here . It 's so good to see you . Dillon did n't say a word to me that you were coming . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut the door on the wind and rain . The sudden stillness silenced him . Jessica stared up at the shadowy figure on the staircase . For a moment she stopped breathing . Dillon always had that effect on her . He lounged against the wall , looking elegant and lazy , classic Dillon . The light spilled across his face , his angel 's face . Thick blue-black hair fell in waves to his shoulders , as shiny as a raven 's wing . His sculptured face , masculine and strong , had that hint of five o'clock shadow along his jaw . His mouth was so sensual , his teeth amazingly white . But it was his eyes , vivid blue , stunningly blue , burning with intensity that always mesmerized everyone , including Jessica . Jessica felt Tara stir beside her , staring up in awe at her father . Trevor made a soft sound , almost of distress . The blue eyes stared down at the three of them . She saw joy , a welcoming expression of surprise dawning on Dillon 's face . He stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart-stopping grin on his face . He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and his bare hands and arms were starkly revealed as if the spotlight had picked up and magnified every detail . Webs of scarred flesh covered his arms , wrists , and hands . His fingers were also scarred and misshapen . The contrast between his face and his body was so great it was shocking . That angel 's face and the twisted , ridged arms and hands . Tara shuddered visibly and flung herself into Jessica 's arms . At once Dillon slipped back into the shadows , the welcoming smile fading as if it had never been . The burning blue eyes had gone from joyful to ice-cold instantly . His gaze raked Jessica 's upturned face , slid over the twins , and came back to her . His sensual mouth tightened ominously . " They 're freezing , Paul ; explanations can wait . Please show them to the bathrooms so they can get out of those wet clothes . You 'll need to prepare a couple more bedrooms . " He started up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows . " And send Jess up to me the minute she 's warm enough . " His voice was still that perfect blend of smoke and edginess , a lethal combination that could brush over her skin like the touch of fingers . Her heart beating in her throat , Jessica stared after him . She turned to look at Paul . " Why did n't you tell me ? He ca n't play , can he ? My God , he ca n't play his music . " She knew what music meant to Dillon . It was his life . His soul . " I did n't know . My mother never brought me back . She came the one time with the twins , but I was ill . When I tried to see him on my own , he refused . " " I 'm sorry . " Tara was crying again . " I did n't mean to do that . I could n't stop looking at his hands . They did n't look human . It was repulsive . I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry Jessie . " Jessica knew the child needed comfort badly . Tara felt guilty and was tired , frightened , and very cold . Shaken by what she had discovered , Jessica had to fight back her own tears . " It 's all right , honey , we 'll find a way to fix this . You need a hot shower and a bed . Everything will be better in the morning . " She looked at Trevor . He was staring up the stairway after his father as if mesmerized . " Trev ? You okay ? " He nodded , clearing his throat . " I 'm fine , but I do n't think he is . " " That 's why we 're here , " she pointed out . Jessica looked at Paul over Tara 's bent head . She did n't believe for a minute that they 'd find a way to fix the damage Tara had done , and looking at Paul 's face , she guessed , neither did he . She forced a smile . " Tara , you might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this is Paul Ritter . He was one of the original members of the HereAfter band , right from the very beginning . He 's a very good friend of your family . " Paul grinned at the girl . " The last time I saw you , you were five years old with a mop of curly black hair . " He held out his hand to Trevor . " You had the same mop and the same curls . " " Still do , " Trevor said , grinning back .
