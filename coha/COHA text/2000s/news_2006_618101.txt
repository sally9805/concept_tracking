<p> Kingston , Tenn.  --  <p> A gentle rain is falling at Whitestone Country Inn as we dash in and settle into the Mallard suite in the Farmhouse , one of five buildings where guests come to unwind in this cozy New England-style village overlooking Watts Bar Lake . <p> The canoes and kayaks at the lake are idle . No wooden balls clack on the croquet lawn . No tennis balls bounce across the nets . Nobody 's angling at the two ponds on the property , one stocked with bass , the other with blue gill and catfish . Horses graze inside the white-fenced lakeside pasture  --  they wo n't be pulling carriages in this weather . <p> It 's quiet this gray afternoon , a good excuse for reading and reflection . Or a nap . And so , after raiding the cookie jar in the communal kitchen and grabbing a complimentary Diet Coke from the in-room fridge stocked with soda and water , we curl up on the daybed , lulled to sleep by the soothing strains of familiar hymns drifting from the gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this AAA four-diamond country estate on 360 lush acres with a vista of the Smoky Mountains to the west , the idea is to slow down , be still and enjoy the peace that permeates this tranquil place that innkeepers Paul and Jean Cowell have dubbed a " sanctuary for the soul . " <p> The Spa at Whitestone is touted as the place to go from " stressed to blessed " in a couple of hours or less . But while we 're definitely not opposed to some serious pampering  --  I 'd spring for the $135 to experience " the works " any day  --  it does n't take a massage to relax tension around here . <p> Originally conceived as a retreat for clergy , missionaries and church staff members , the inn now welcomes people from all walks of life and religions  --  although the ambience is unmistakably Christian , with Scripture on framed artwork and inspirational books in the rooms . <p> Even the name Whitestone comes from Revelation 2:17 that reads : " I will also give him a white stone with a new name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <p> Whitestone is headquarters for the Christian Hospitality Network , a fellowship of more than 1,000 Christian lodging owners worldwide " providing places to stay that reflect your values . " CHN properties agree to offer discounts of at least 25 percent to full-time Christian workers midweek and off-season . <p> " We believe that hospitality is a Christian virtue , " says CHN director Joe Castillo , an ordained minister who assists the Cowells with innkeeping and pastoral duties . His wife , Cindy , is in charge of house-keeping . <p> The Rev. Bill Ricketts , senior pastor of Prince Avenue Baptist Church in Athens likes the place so much he has brought his staff for a working retreat for the third time . <p> " I think , No. 1 , it 's quiet , and you 're away from all the rush and stress and pushing of daily life , " Ricketts says . " It 's nice to step into an atmosphere where you can get work done . We have a busy staff , so it 's nice having quiet time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " Paul and his staff do such a good job of making you feel special . They are so gracious and they make me feel at home . It 's refreshing . " <p> Guests are invited to the interdenominational service led by Cowell at 10:30 a.m . Sundays in the Chapel of the Good Shepherd  --  or to stop in for prayer or meditation anytime  --  but there 's no pressure to attend . <p> And unless you mind bowing your head when Cowell or Castillo says grace before the evening meal , you wo n't feel like anybody is trying to save your soul  --  just provide a sanctuary for it . <p> Castillo gave thanks the night we were there and prefaced his short prayer with a welcome and invitation to diners gathered at tables in the Lion &; the Lamb dining room overlooking the lake : " Catch your breath . Take your time . Nobody will take your plate away from you before you 're done . " <p> The opening of Whitestone was a long-held dream of the Cowells , both of whom are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby Knoxville from 1963 to 1982 before starting a hugely successful business , Book Warehouse , a chain of 90 discount bookstores in 1986 . In 1988 , Paul became chairman of the board and principal stockholder of Shop at Home , a home-shopping television network . <p> In 1991 , they purchased the land where Whitestone would be developed on 39,000-acre Watts Bar Lake . The property is surrounded by a 5,400-acre wildlife and waterfowl reserve and the Smoky Mountains loom to the west . Bright flowers and herbs blanket gardens throughout the property . <p> Whitestone received its first guests in 1997 in the rust-red Entrance Barn , a drive-through building with four suites , and the bright red Schoolhouse with two more suites . <p> Since then , the rural retreat has added the centerpiece lodging facility : the 15,000-square-foot Farmhouse , housing nine luxurious rooms and suites , with king beds , spa tubs ( with candles , a nice touch ) and comfy seating for reading and relaxing . A huge two-sided stone fireplaces greets guests in the entry hall . Just added this spring is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being served to inn guests rather than at the Lion &; the Lamb dining room . There 's a kitchen with help-yourself snacks on the main level , a library on the second floor and a game room with a pool table and fireplace downstairs . The intimate spa off the game room offers weary travelers services including massages , hot stone therapy and salt glow treatments . <p> The Farmhouse 's suites , like all 20 rooms , are named after birds of the area  --  Cardinal , Mallard , Bluebird , etc.  --  and feature colorful stained-glass transoms depicting the room 's feathered namesake . Two more rooms are in the pretty-in-pink Rose Cottage and three luxury suites are upstairs at the Victorian-style Lion &; the Lamb . <p> The Carpenter Gothic chapel , perched on the property 's highest point , is modeled after the 1880 Christ Church in Rugby , Tenn . A stunning circular stained-glass window behind the pulpit area features a crown and staff , representing Christ 's roles as king and shepherd . The beams are oak pegged and depict three crosses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the adjacent large gazebo . Cowell and Castillo perform hundreds of weddings a year . <p> One of those was the wedding of Amanda and Jeff Creacy in August 2004 . <p> " They were so gracious , " says Amanda 's mother , Betty Sue Ash , director of preschooling at Prince Avenue Baptist . " They took care of everything . The attention and care they show to people , it 's very special to us . " <p> The Cowells and their accommodating staff  --  which includes son Kevin and his wife , Vicki , who live on the property with their four children  --  do n't just try to feed the soul ; they do a darn good job of keeping bellies full . <p> Breakfast , included in the room rate and $9.95 for other guests , is a belt-loosener featuring scrambled eggs with cheese and spinach , chunky hash-browns , bacon , sausage , biscuits and gravy , oatmeal , fresh fruit and pastries such as scones and muffins . Lunch , at $13.95 , might be London broil and wild rice risotto with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner ( $29.95 ) , a four-course repast . Ours starts with sausage-stuffed mushrooms in pesto cream sauce and a colorful mixed green salad with strawberries , mandarin oranges , pecans and poppyseed dressing . The main attraction is a duo of salmon fillet with maple-ginger sauce and a rib-eye steak with grilled pineapple , served with sides of roasted new potatoes and broccoli with julienned carrots . <p> The inn 's signature fruit iced tea is served . Wine or beer is n't available in this dry county , but brown-bagging is allowed . <p> For dessert , you could choose chocolate tort with raspberry sauce or Whitestone Delight Pie , a teeth-rattling sweet concoction that includes cream cheese , sweetened condensed milk , whipping cream , butter , pecans and coconut , drizzled with caramel topping and chocolate pie . ( We buy copies of the " Favorite Recipes of Whitestone Country Inn " cookbook to try to replicate it at home . ) <p> At this point , waddling back to our rooms is about all we can do .
