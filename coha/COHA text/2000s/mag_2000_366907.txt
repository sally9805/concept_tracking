Lieut . General Claudia Kennedy , the Army 's top intelligence officer , has long been the service 's best advertisement for gender equality . She was the first  --  and is still the only  --  female three-star general in the Army . Defense Secretary William Cohen lauded her last fall as " an officer who has made a career of defying barriers . " Moreover , fellow officers say she is an Army loyalist who would never take a " cheap shot " at the service she loves . Nevertheless , she has dealt the Army a major blow by filing a sexual-harassment complaint against a fellow general . The incident allegedly occurred in Kennedy 's Pentagon office in late 1996 , when a male major general  --  the same rank as hers at the time  --  " inappropriately touched " her , according to an Army officer familiar with the case . The alleged harasser has not been identified . <P> Kennedy 's charge is the latest in a string of sexual-harassment episodes that have plagued the Army . In 1996 male drill sergeants at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged and later convicted of sexually assaulting female recruits . A year later the Army 's top enlisted man , Sergeant Major Gene McKinney , was charged with  --  but later acquitted of  --  sexual assault . In the past year the service has punished two generals for adultery . <P> When Kennedy , 52 , got her third star nearly three years ago , she said she had been sexually harassed during her 30-year Army career . Initially she handled these incidents privately , she said , but began reporting them as she rose through the ranks . " I was very impressed with the way it was handled , " she told ABC in June 1997 . Kennedy , who is retiring this year , filed a formal complaint about the ' 96 incident only late last year , after the Army gave the man involved a new and better job . If Army investigators believe her account , the general could face a court-martial . <P>  --  By Mark Thompson/Washington                   @ @
