Early in the morning under a daylight moon , they saw the Reverend facedown in the shallows , black hair afloat , arms outstretched like a Jesus . They pulled him out of the seaweeds and flopped him onto his back , the man big-bellied and naked from the waist down . The crowd of onlookers surged forward for a closer view , a few boys in prom suits hopping onto car hoods and peering over heads . Another Belize City Police Land Rover drove up and two more cops got out and walked over to the group standing around the body . <p> <p> Across the clearing on a small rise , Leo Varela sat behind the wheel of his father 's BMW in a rumpled gray suit , a wilted carnation stuck in a buttonhole . He watched the cops talking , occasionally pointing . His eyes were bleary and he reeked of rum and Cokes . Patrick , his older brother , was in pajamas in the other front seat , exhaling morning breath through the open window . Freddy Robinson was in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking them for the play-by-play . <p> <p> All around , St. John 's boys in prom suits sat or stood on car hoods watching . Most of them had taken their dates home hours ago , then had flocked to Lonesome Point after they heard . <p> <p> One of the policemen turned and studied the swarm of cars . He spoke to another cop , a tall black man , and within seconds they were marching across the clearing ordering everybody to leave , roll out . Boys stood up with defiant slowness and ambled around to get into their cars , start them up . The tall black cop sauntered up the rise to the BMW  --  Alfonso Robinson , Freddy 's cousin . Strolling over to Patrick 's window now . He put his hands on the roof , ducked down . " Time to go home to Mommy . " <p> <p> Patrick said , " Hey , man , Leo woke me , told me what happened . It 's really the Rev ? " <p> <p> " Indeed . Ugly scene . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned across his brother 's lap . " What happened to him , Fonso ? " <p> <p> " Got shot . Took one in the skull , two in the back . " Fonso shook his head . " Man had no drawers on or nothin ' . " <p> <p> Cars filled with St. John 's boys drove past , some of the boys throwing up waves to Leo and Freddy . <p> <p> " So tell me , " Patrick said , " where 's the Rev 's car ? " <p> <p> Fonso said , " Well , " and spat off to the side . " Assuming the Rev came here in his car , looks like somebody stole it . " <p> <p> Leo gazed across the clearing to the cops standing around the body , silty waves washing up on the hard sand . Seaweed and pebbles and driftwood littered the beach to where it turned west and petered out near a bank of mangroves . It was beginning to sink in : The Reverend was dead , a family friend , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fonso said , " You guys best get on outta here . " He tilted his head to the rear . " Before the inspector starts crawling up my ass . " <p> <p> They drove away through the open barbed-wire gate , the grand entrance to this ragged beach people had used for years for every illicit pleasure imaginable . In the eighties , a developer had cleared this land , eight miles up the Northern Highway , dredged canals , and started building concrete homes . Then he went broke or was in prison for embezzlement in Panama , Leo forgot which , and now the land was the public 's to enjoy despite a gigantic no trespassing sign out front . <p> <p> Back on the Northern , Leo kept his mind on the Reverend lying there with no pants , his skin looking like rubber . Freddy pulled out his Bic to spark the joint , but Patrick turned around and glared . " Not in the car , dude . " In the rearview , Leo saw Freddy tuck the joint behind his ear . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddy 's neighborhood , and Leo sped toward it , his eyelids getting heavy , the long night catching up to him . He turned right onto the dirt street , steered around rain puddles and deep potholes . High grass crowded both sides , ramshackle wooden houses set back in weedy yards . <p> <p> " Drop me off here by these brothas , " Freddy said . <p> <p> A small group of teens was hanging out in front of a corner store , a couple of them leaning on bicycles . They watched with surly cool as the car pulled up . <p> <p> Freddy got out and slammed the door shut , maybe a touch too hard for Patrick 's liking . " Yo , listen , Lee , " bending at the waist to look through Patrick 's window . " We 'll party again soon ? " <p> <p> " Course . I do n't leave for another two weeks . " <p> <p> Freddy grinned . " My boy . Off to fuckin ' college and shit . Somebody pinch my black ass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . " <p> <p> Freddy reached in across Patrick and bumped fists with Leo . He pulled out and looked at Patrick . " Nice jammies . Got any with fire engines on them ? That 'd look cute . Or Superman ? " <p> <p> Patrick turned his face to the windshield , hit the button and the car window slid up . <p> <p> A minute later , Patrick said , " You really should be happy you 're leaving , know that ? " <p> <p> " How so ? " <p> <p> Patrick sighed . " Well , for one , just that you could n't do any worse than hanging around that loser . " <p> <p> Leo opened his mouth to say something , thought better of it . He and Patrick would probably never understand each other . <p> <p> Near the city , Leo thought again about the Reverend and got his mind off that by thinking about Celina instead . <p> <p> Remembering her look of surprise when he 'd shown her his old notebook full of long prose poems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this about you . Then , last night , kissing her by the Fort George Hotel pool when the prom was winding down . The taste of her tongue , like rum and Coke , only more intense and sweeter . Her shiny black hair like a curtain that hid their kisses . <p> <p> He pushed the car up to sixty-five , seventy . They tore down the road , only a couple of cars heading the other way so early in the morning . They flashed by the toilet paper factory and the truck depot . Flew by the propane gas plant and the old Texaco station , and coming up now on the left was Varela &amp; Sons . The largest used car dealership in the country . Whenever his father bragged about that , Leo would think , Yeah , Dad , that 's because most of those cars jammed in that clay yard behind that high chain-link , beside that three-story glass building that does n't really suit third-world Belize  --  most of those cars are stolen ; and everybody knows . <p> <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Varela &amp; Sons again . <p> <p> They were coming into the city , curving around the circular onto Princess Margaret Drive , and Leo felt relieved that he was almost home and just days away from leaving home , setting out on his own . His shoulders relaxed . He lifted his foot off the gas and cruised . " You going to tell Dad ? " <p> <p> When Patrick made no reply , Leo turned his head to look at him . <p> <p> His brother had gone ghost-white . Hunched over , hugging himself . <p> <p> Leo looked away . <p> <p> Yeah , it must be hitting Patrick now , the cold shock that somebody had murdered the Reverend . Their father 's right-hand man . <p> <p> Excerpted from Lonesome Point by Ian Vasquez . Copyright 2009 by Ian Vasquez . Published in June 2009 by St. Martin 's Press
