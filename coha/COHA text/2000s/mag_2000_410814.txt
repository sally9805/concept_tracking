Observers indulge in the Eta Aquarids , a new comet , and a great conjunction. // The long-awaited , though invisible , conjunction of five planets occurs during the first two weeks of May . Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn all lie on the far side of the sun as seen from Earth , spanning a 27 stretch of sky on May 3 . The moon is also included in the collection . Two weeks later , on May 17 , the six bodies minus the moon stretch out across only 19.5 of the sky . The grouping can not be seen because the sun is in the way . In reality , the planets , as always , lie far apart this grouping is merely a line of sight effect , but nonetheless unusual . It is sure to spark some media attention ( see Strange Universe , page 93 ) . Mercury makes a brief appearance in the evening sky after sunset . Look for it low in the west on May 19 when it shines at magnitude - 1.2 . Mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible at magnitude 1.5 in the bright twilight just a half hour after sunset . Mercury itself dims rapidly as it moves away from the solar glow but becomes visible in a dark sky , setting almost two hours after the sun on May 31 at magnitude - 0.2 , making it an easy target . It reaches greatest elongation early next month . The final vestiges of the winter sky descend in the west . During early May evenings , Orion hangs temporarily over the western horizon , soon to be swallowed by the encroaching twilight of the advancing summer . As with all stars , the bright beacons set four minutes earlier each day a symptom of Earth 's true rotation being four minutes shorter than our 24-hour clocks . Take Gemini for example : On May l , the entire constellation , with its two recognizable bright stars Castor and Pollux , can be seen in a dark sky above the western horizon after 11 PM. local time . By May 31 Gemini lies in the same location relative to the horizon , but now in a bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes along with it the hazy curtain of the Milky Way . Look to the northeast and you 'll see Cygnus the Swan rising , carrying the summer Milky Way with it . For a few hours , the entire Milky Way appears to lay along the horizon - a sight only visible from the darkest observing locations . Dust and gas in the spiral arms of the Milky Way Galaxy block our view of the universe beyond . During the few hours of late springtime evenings , it 's as if the curtain is being pulled aside and the magic of exploring the universe full of galaxies is yours . Our view at night is directly up and away from the galactic plane and out into deep space . The spring sky is relatively sparse in stars except for three bright notables . Gemlike Arcturus shimmers all night as a resplendent orange beacon in Bootes the Herdsman . The sparkling diamond of Spica in Virgo competes for attention , though it 's not as high above the southern horizon as Arcturus . Somewhat farther west lies Regulus , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out and share your low of observing with others . Under dark skies , you might even catch a stray meteor or two . // constellation of Leo the Lion . Both Spica and Regulus can be occulted by the moon since they lie close enough to the ecliptic to get in our satellite 's path . Unfortunately , no such events occur this year . In fact , you 'll have to wait until 2005 for the next 1st-magnitude star to be occulted by the moon , when a series of events involving Antares ( in Scorpius ) takes place . Arcturus , Spica , and Regulus border the fascinating region of sky that is our deep window to the universe . In the direction of the constellations Bootes , Virgo , and Leo , light from galaxies millions of lightyears away can reach us relatively unhindered by the intervening gas and dust of the Milky Way . Even so , light from that far away is pretty faint . The familiar law that causes light to dim by a factor of two as the distance doubles really comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any object , but in a predictable fashion . It 's this law that allows us to calculate the distance to astronomical objects . To detect the dim light emitted by galaxies millions of years ago requires a careful method . You need long-exposure photographs or imaging with a CCD camera to produce views such as those depicted in magazines and books . Search for the brighter members first . One galaxy off the beaten track but bright and easy to find is the Sombrero Galaxy , M104 . It lies at the same declination as Spica , but farther west . Turn your polar-aligned scope to Spica - which lies at a right ascension of 13h25.2m and declination - 11deg10 ' ( epoch 2000.0 ) . M104 lies at R.A. 12h40.Om and Dec. - 11deg37 ' ' . Move your telescope due west of Spica by 45 minutes of R.A. , or about 11 , using setting circles as a guide . Next , scan from east to west to find M 104 in a lowpower field of view . M104 is a large spiral galaxy almost edge on to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur scopes . The Sombrero lies about 55 million light-years from Earth at the southern end of the large Virgo supercluster of galaxies . Virgo is the second largest constellation in the sky and home to most of the galaxies visible during any one night . It is surpassed in size only by the serpentine Hydra the Water Snake . Hydra stretches about 100deg - spanning from a dim line of stars south of Spica west to the serpent 's head , a compact little grouping of six 4thmagnitude stars just south of the Beehive Cluster ( M44 ) in Cancer the Crab . The brightest star in Hydra is 2nd-magnitude Alpha ( a ) Hydrae , or Alphard , a name that means " The Solitary One . " Alphard lies 200 south of Regulus . Another wonderful galaxy with an interesting dust feature , this time near its center , creates the appearance of a black eye . The Blackeye Galaxy , or M64 ( R.A. 12h56.7m , Dec. 21deg41 ' ' ) , discovered by Johann Bode in 1779 , shines at magnitude 8.5 . M64 lies north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive but faint grouping called Coma Berenices . Also referred to as the Sleeping Beauty Galaxy , the galaxy 's form has an odd feature the inner disk rotates in one direction while the outer disk rotates in the opposite direction . The interaction between these two disks has created a region of new star formation , near the visible dust lane . Photograph FIRST VIEWS : Star Clusters M44 and M67 Star clusters , a favorite type of deep-sky object , present no end in variation , from bright and splashy to faint but rich . The stars are formed from the same cloud of gas and kept together by gravity . M44 and M67 are clusters that appear close together in the sky and can be viewed from a city . Once the first humans befriended the starry skies , they noticed a strange cloudlike glow sitting between the bright stars Regulus and Castor in Cancer the Crab . No one knew for sure what it was until Galileo turned a new device known as the telescope skyward and discovered the first open star cluster . This 3rd-magnitude cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means " manger . " We now refer to it as the Beehive Cluster . Binoculars are the too ! of choice for viewing its swarm of stars . When you use a telescope , you miss half the spectacle and lose the perspective of seeing the whole cluster against sparse surroundings . The Beehive is one of the closest clusters to the solar system , lying only 500 light-years away , but farther than the Pleiades or Hyades . Astronomers have determined its age as 660 million years . In contrast , the age estimate for M67 is 3.2 billion years , about one-fifth the age of the universe . It lies five times farther away than M44 at some 2,500 light-years . M67 was discovered by a contemporary of Charles Messier , the German observer Johann Koehler , in the 1770s . M67 is an easy target for binoculars under country skies , but from the city , you 'll have to hop 6 north from the " top left " of Hydra 's head . Immediately you will notice that most of M6Ts stars are of similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a near-perfect circle 15 ' across . More than 300 stars have been recognized as belonging to the cluster . Photograph Eta Aquarids Meteor Max What could be better than spending a mild , moonless morning under the stars , watching Halley 's children streak across the sky ? Dust emitted from Halley 's Comet long ago still orbits the sun , and some of it crosses Earth 's orbit . We reach one of those intersections in early May . ( The other one occurs in mid-October . ) Our relative impact speed of 40 miles per second ( 66 km/sec ) lets dust quickly ionize high in our atmosphere , producing the flashes of light we see as meteors . Peaking on the weekend of the 5th , the Eta Aquarid shower produces about 15 swift meteors per hour under a dark sky . They appear to radiate from the constellation Aquarius near the star Eta ( n ) . Because Aquarius rises in the southeast just after midnight , you might want to grab a nap ahead of time and set your alarm so you do n't fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up before the sun . For optimal viewing look straight overhead . The Eta Aquarids remain popular because a fair percentage leave glowing trains . Use binoculars to watch the faintly glowing trails twist slowly in the upper-level atmospheric winds . The light you see is the meteor ; the chunk of debris that produces it is a meteoroid ; and any material that reaches Earth is known as a meteorite . Photograph Mars the Valiant Mars is still not ready to surrender . Now , more than a year since its brilliant command of the spring 1999 sky , Mars is still just visible . Huddled low in sunset 's twilight colors , the diminutive God of War glows a feeble magnitude 1.5 , revealing itself to a binocular search . Chances are the first star you 'll see low in the northwest is the similarly colored Aldebaran , shining slightly brighter at magnitude 1.0 . Mars is one and a half to two binocular fields to the right and a bit lower . If you wait until a full hour after sunset early in the month , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars 's right . Mars becomes increasingly difficult to spot as the days tick by . Is it still possible to see when the much brighter Mercury at magnitude - 1.2 soars close to Mars 's upper right on the 18th ? ( See " Mercury 's Spring Skip , " page 71 . ) Keep an eye out on the evening of the 5th as the thin crescent moon slides only 1deg away from Aldebaran . If you live in the southern states , try for the young moon on the previous night , the 4th , when it will be only 20 hours old ( 23 hours on the west coast ) . Farther north , the sun-moon line is closer to the horizon , making the young moon more difficult to find behind buildings and in the horizon 's glow . // This map portrays the sky at times shown in the upper right corner of the page . Located just outside the map are the four directions : north , south , east , and west . To find stars above your horizon , hold the map overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're facing . The stars above the map 's horizon now match what 's in the sky . Photograph The Path of The Planet Photograph The Ice Mound Cometh Barring any surprise , which we 're always hoping for , Comet LINEAR 1999 S4 will be the brightest one of the year . Astronomers believe it will peak in July around 4th magnitude , making it visible to the naked eye . It 's always fascinating to watch a comet in its early stages . By the very end of May , Comet LINEAR will have climbed low into the predawn sky in Triangulum , glowing perhaps brighter than 10th magnitude . Before then it 's close to the sun and suffers from interfering moonlight . An 8- or 10-inch telescope at low power will show you a small , galaxylike fuzzball . Can you see a sharp core ? If so , this is not the actual nucleus of the comet , but the inner envelope of gas and dust , or coma . Large scope owners who live in the south and want a considerable challenge might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the month . Unlike the names of many other famous comets , the name LINEAR does not derive from a person who made the discovery , but rather a team with a robotic telescope and computer system at MIT . LINEAR stands for Lincoln Laboratory Near Earth Asteroid Research . The comets they discover are a by-product of their true goal : asteroids . You can learn more about this successful program at **29;1271;TOOLONG or read about it in our April 1999 issue . Photograph Mercury 's Spring Skip The best Mercury apparition of the year starts in the last week of May for northern observers . You ca n't miss it if you know when and where to look . At about 8 P.M. , scan one binocular field above the point where the sun had set an hour earlier . At magnitude-0.5 , the yellow-orange speck will be noticeable near the horizon . Farther north , the sixth brightest star in the sky , Capella , stands much higher up . It you hold out your arm fully extended , Capella should be two fist-widths above the horizon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By month 's end , Mercury has faded to magnitude 0 but should be somewhat easier to spot because it has climbed away from the horizon 's glow . It reaches its maximum height in the first days of June , perfect for pointing the way to a very thin crescent moon on the evening of the 3rd . The moon lies a binocular field below Mercury . Capture a picture of Mercury as it tries to break free from the horizon 's glare . Photographers attempting to grab a portrait of Mercury often lose its glimmer in the light of the departing sun . Find a location where any light pollution from a city is behind you , so it ca n't possibly add to washing out your image . // Yet another fine example of dust lanes can be found 6deg northwest of M64 . The great edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4565 ( R.A. 12h36.3m , Dec. 25deg59 ' ' ) appears as a pencil-like smudge of light a quarter of a degree long and just 2 ' wide . Try spotting the prominent dust lane that bisects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane of the Milky Way and prevents us from seeing many galaxies at times of the year when the Milky Way is above the horizon . Many dim galaxies lie within reach of amateur scopes , but they are not the only challenging objects visible this month . Pluto reaches its peak magnitude for the year on May 31 . Because the distant planet glows feebly at magnitude 13.7 , just seeing Pluto is an achievement . After midnight during early May is the best time to search for Pluto , while the moon stays below the horizon . The dim planet lies less than 10 away from the magnitude 4.6 star 20 Ophiuchi , which itself is just 30 east of the brighter Zeta ( 4 ) Ophiuchi . ( See " Pluto Hunting Season , " page 72 . ) By 3 A.M. local time , Uranus and Neptune are above the southeastern horizon . Both are visible using binoculars among the faint stars of Capricornus the Sea Goat . Dimmer Neptune rises near midnight and lies in the eastern part of the constellation 1.60 east-southeast of the magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at magnitude 7.9 , just visible in binoculars . Its disk , 2 " in diameter , requires a telescope to detect . The minor planet Vesta lurks in the same region as Neptune . Moving eastward against the stars of Sagittarius , it reaches a point 3.10 north of the globular cluster M75 on May 15 and then crosses into Capricornus . Vesta is the brightest asteroid visible this month , glowing at magnitude 6.6 and brightening as it - approaches opposition in July , when it will appear brighter than Uranus , at magnitude 5.4 . Binoculars are sufficient to track its progress against the starry background . Photograph Iris Crawls over the Crab steroid 7 Iris floats in front of Cancer the Crab in the last week of April . The star cluster M67 ( see FIRST ViEws : Star Clusters M44 and M67 , page 69 ) provides a nice backdrop for Iris , before the space rock appears to make a beeline toward the star Kappa ( x ) Cancri on the 14th . Discovered by John Russell Hind on August 13 , 1847 , this 125-mile-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddess of the Rainbow . On April 28th , you can find Iris only 30 ' ' , one moonwidth , southwest of M67 . The asteroid shines at a similar brightness to the cluster stars . Iris lies only 3 ' east of Kappa on the 14th . You should see it continuing to shift eastward during the evening . At magnitude 10.5 , Iris is similar in brightness to three field stars east of Kappa , perfect for watching it move over a three-hour period . Use a 4-inch scope or larger to follow it from one night to the next . Iris belongs to the S-class of asteroids , which means it is composed mainly of silicate minerals . This class is relatively common for asteroids that reside in the inner portion of the main asteroid belt . Eunomia and Amphitrite are other well-known members of this class . Photograph Pluto Hunting Season If it 's spring , it must be time to go to a dark site and ferret out the solar system 's most distant planet . Fortunately , there are some easy skyposts that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first or last week of May , when the moon is out of the sky . Wait until at least midnight , to let the southern sky swing above the horizon 's haze . Then find the three equally spaced bright stars forming the base of Ophiuchus and point your 8-inch or larger scope at the middle one . Experienced observers can spot Pluto in a 4-inch scope if they really want a challenge . Fortunately , just off to the east lies 20 Ophiuchi ( also see the map an pages 67 and 68 ) , a 4.6-magnitude star that will be a fine starting point . Unfortunately , Pluto lies in the same low-power field to the southwest . You 'll need to shift your scope down a bit to prevent 20 Ophiuchi 's glare from blasting your dark adaptation . Use the chart and slowly increase the magnification past 150x in order to find the magnitude 13.7 Pluto relative to the fainter stars in the area . Do n't give up if you ca n't see it immediately . Many first timers take 30 minutes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flashlight , even a dim one , to check the chart , you temporarily lose your ability to see faint objects in the dark . It really pays to memorize miniature star patterns that point the way . Follow the advice of advanced observers . Use a dark cloth over your head to cut out stray light and do n't hold your breath because your brain needs oxygen . If you use a star diagonal , photocopy the chart , flip it over , and shine your flashlight up from underneath , to match the reversed orientation in your eyepiece. // Uranus rises an hour after Neptune . At magnitude 5.7 , it 's easy to see in binoculars , lying 2deg northwest of Gamma ( gamma ) Capricorni , the magnitude 3.8 star near the northeast corner of Capricornus . Telescopes reveal the greenish disk almost 4 " in diameter . Following the grand conjunction of the planets , Jupiter and Saturn emerge from the sun 's glow , and Venus sinks toward conjunction with the sun . On May 17 , Venus and Jupiter have their closest conjunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 6:30 n.Nt . EDT . This occurs in daylight just 6deg from the blinding sun , so only try viewing this event if you are well practiced at working near the sun . Remember that one mistake in pointing could result in permanent blindness if the sun inadvertently enters the field of view . ( See " OBSERVER 's CHALLENGE : Venus and Jupiter Graze , " page 73 . ) Another conjunction occurs toward the end of May when , for a period of a few days , Jupiter and Saturn appear together in the same low-power field of view . Their closest point occurs on May 28 , when only 1.1 separate them . By the end of the month the pair lie 15 away from the sun , so they remain in bright twilight , but this rare appearance is worth a try . Saturn is practically double the distance from us as Jupiter is . Finally , this year 's Eta Aquarid meteor shower should put on a good show because a new moon occurs on May 5 , a day before the peak . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side of the peak date . However , the radiant rises only an hour or two before dawn . This geometry means North American observers have the chance to view meteors that skim our atmosphere , resulting in considerable path lengths . Make sure to watch out for the occasional fireball . This splash of solar system debris into our atmosphere has the significance of being one of the two annual meteor showers associated with Halley 's Comet , the other shower is October 's Orionids . ( See " Eta Aquarids Meteor Max , " page 70 . ) OBSERVER 'S CHALLENGE : Venus and Jupiter Graze Lucky Europeans have the chance to see Venus lie less than one Jupiter-diameter from the mighty gas giant . Late in the morning of the 17th , Venus will scoot past Jupiter almost fast enough to see orbital motion in real time . When the close pair rises high enough for North Americans , they will be only 4 ' apart , still close enough to fit in your highest power eyepiece . Venus plays a mock Galilean satellite , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and Europa . Photograph // The real trick is not just that it happens in morning 's light , but that they lie so close to the sun , only 70 away . Is it worth the effort ? Every ounce . To take the challenge , you 'll need one of those deep-blue-sky days . The slightest haze or cirrus clouds will wash out any chance of seeing this event . If you live in the southern states , you may get a chance to see them just above the horizon in the few minutes before sunrise . This sort of observing requires a warning : Make sure that sunlight does not enter your telescope . An extra set of hands is the best defense . Hold a screen just off to the side , to put the front of the telescope in shadow . If your scope is aligned and you have setting circles , then it is a straightforward jump to Venus and Jupiter . Cap the front of the scope and finder , and then try to make the scope 's shadow as small as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.5 south ( down ) , and 26.8 minutes of R.A. west ( right ) . Dobsonian owners can try different offset methods . The previous night , set your scope on Arcturus and shift it 2.2 south . Note the time . Twelve hours and 54 minutes later , on the morning of the 17th , Venus and Jupiter should lie within a 1 field of view ( unless wind has moved the scope ) . The second method involves using a planetarium computer program to get the following specifics for you . Sometime around 11:30 a.nn. , the pair will lie exactly west of the sun , that is , at the same altitude in the sky . Cover the scope as noted above to start at the sun , then shift 7 in azimuth to the right , using your best guess . Whatever method you choose , use your lowest power to locate them . Remember to leave your telescope focused from a previous night to avoid an increased challenge of searching for a faint , out-of-focus image . Jupiter will remain a ghostly disk compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lying on the sunward side of Jupiter . An additional challenge follows during the last week of May . Saturn lies a bit more than 1 south of Jupiter , but fortunately the sun is farther away , about 14 . Even if smog or clouds are n't present , Saturn may not be visible at all , but why not give it a try ?
