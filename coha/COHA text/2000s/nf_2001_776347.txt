Excerpt // RACE AND THE SCHOOLS // BEFORE BROWN // Listening to black people who dared publicly to challenge racism  --  and to optimistic white liberals  --  in the 1940s and early 1950s , we can see how they imagined the approach of a new , more egalitarian world of race relations in the United States : // A black American corporal , 1945 : " I spent four years in the Army to free a bunch of Dutchmen and Frenchmen , and I 'm hanged if I 'm going to let the Alabama version of the Germans kick me around when I get home . No sirreee-bob ! I went into the Army a nigger ; I 'm comin ' out a man . " // Gunnar Myrdal , in his magisterial study of race relations in the United States , An American Dilemma , 1944 : " Not since Reconstruction has there been more reason to anticipate fundamental changes in American race relations , changes which will involve a development toward American ideals . " ( italics his ) // President Harry Truman , addressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extension of civil rights today means not protection of the people against the government , but protection of the people by the government .... We must make the federal government a friendly , vigilant defender of the rights and equalities of all Americans . And again I mean all Americans . " // Thurgood Marshall , head of the NAACP 's Legal Defense and Educational Fund , envisioning in March 1954 the centennial in 1963 of the Emancipation Proclamation : " Come hell or high water , we are going to be free in ' 63. " // * * * // These hopeful voices , like others in the late 1940s and early 1950s , articulated the three most powerful forces behind changes in American race relations at the time  --  and later : rising militancy among blacks , including some 900,000 young men who had fought in a war for freedom and democracy , and many others who were streaming out of the Jim Crow South for jobs in the North or West ; increasingly vocal support from white liberals like Myrdal and Truman ; and the activism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . // These three forces were indeed promoting reform of race relations , which had been terrible before 1940 . Support for racism based on " scientific " ideas plummeted after 1945 to near insignificance outside the Deep South . Membership in the NAACP , by far the most important civil rights organization until the 1960s , jumped from 50,000 in 1940 to 450,000 in 1946 . The NAACP , with only 800 branches in 1939 , expanded to 14,000 branches by 1948 . Eleven states and twenty-eight cities in the North enacted laws between 1945 and 1951 that established Fair Employment Practices Commissions ( FEPCs ) ; eighteen states approved legislation calling for the end of racial discrimination in public accommodations. // Blacks gained slowly in politics , too , winning elections as councilmen in Richmond and Nashville in the late 1940s . Atlanta broke ground in 1948 by hiring its first black policemen . In the eleven states of the Old Confederacy ( the " South " in normal parlance ) , the percentage of eligible black people who were registered to vote rose from 3 percent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one million black people in 1952. // Truman 's efforts especially encouraged advocates of more egalitarian race relations . Although he moved cautiously at first  --  like Franklin Roosevelt , he was loath to antagonize powerful southerners in Congress and in the Democratic party  --  he became bolder in 1947 , in part because he hoped to win northern black votes in 1948 and in part because he recognized that the United States , as leader of the Free World in the Cold War , ought to practice what it preached . In 1948 he issued executive orders calling for desegregation of the armed forces and for the end of racial discrimination in federal hiring practices . He also asked Congress to outlaw poll taxes , which prevented many blacks and other poor people from voting ; to establish a permanent FEPC at the national level ; and to make lynching a federal offense , thereby stripping racist white Southerners of control over prosecution of that crime . Although Congress refused his legislative requests , liberals hoped for the future . Truman , after all , was the first American president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil rights of blacks . // The courts also gave liberals cause for high expectations . Endorsing Thurgood Marshall 's efforts , the Supreme Court declared in 1944 that " white primaries " were unconstitutional . These primaries , widely used in the heavily Democratic southern states , had barred blacks from the all-important nominating process . In 1946 the Court ruled against state laws that had required segregated seating on interstate buses . In 1948 it decided that " restrictive housing covenants , " private pacts used by whites to keep blacks ( and other " undesirables " ) out of residential neighborhoods , were not enforceable in the courts . In 1950 , the Court issued three notable rulings on the same day . Two of these attacked racial discrimination at the level of graduate education ; the third struck down racially segregated dining facilities on interstate trains . These were heartening developments for foes of racial discrimination . // * * * // Enjoying the supposed advantages of hindsight , some students of American race relations have looked at these developments and concluded that the Bad Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were slowly on their way out by 1954 . Blacks were indeed restless , and they were making progress in politics , employment , and economic status . But how strong was this progress , and how far might it have moved in the absence of something so dramatic as Brown ? There is no sure answer to such questions . But we can wonder if the Myrdals of the world  --  who predicted ever-onward and upward progress until the United States approached what Myrdal called the " American Creed " of equality and justice for all  --  exaggerated the possibilities for rapid change . In retrospect it seems clear that hopeful liberals in the 1940s and early 1950s had overly optimistic expectations . They underestimated the staying power of racist ideas and practices in the United States , where not only blacks but also other groups such as Mexicans , Native Americans , and Jews still encountered widespread discrimination . // To appreciate the strength of such discrimination in the early postwar years we may begin by looking at the difficulties faced by militant blacks at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppression . Like the Alabama soldier who said he had gone to war a " nigger " and was returning a " man , " a South Carolina veteran recalled how he had refused to accept third-class status in 1945 . Urged by an official of the Veterans Administration to seek a job as a laborer , he retorted , " I was a staff sergeant in the Army ... traveled all over England ... sat fourteen days in the English Channel . I was n't going to push a wheel barrow . " Many of the black leaders of postwar civil rights activity in Mississippi  --  Amzie Moore , Aaron Henry , Medgar Evers  --  had also become militant while serving in the segregated armed services during the war . ( Evers insisted on trying to vote , only to be driven away by whites wielding pistols . ) Harry Briggs , who was later to become one of twenty plaintiffs in the South Carolina case against racial discrimination that Marshall carried to the courts in 1948 , was a Navy veteran with five children . // Anger at racist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among black students . In 1946 , the youth council of the NAACP in Lumberton , North Carolina , called a strike of students to protest against the inferior facilities in their schools . Black students in Hearne , Texas , staged a similar strike a year later . When these groups demanded quick action from the Legal Defense Fund , Thurgood Marshall grew testy , complaining about people who " want the lawyers to prepare the case , file it , have it decided and have everything straightened out in fifteen minutes . " But he lent assistance nonetheless . The controversies abated when Lumberton and Hearne officials , feeling the pressure , improved their black schools . // To say , however , that some black Americans in the postwar years , notably veterans and increasing numbers of young people , stood up to challenge white racism is not to conclude that they were able to accomplish great things . To be sure , many African Americans came to enjoy better lives in the postwar era . Masses of black people poured out of the southern countryside in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial work . Over time they spearheaded the rise of a substantial middle class in southern cities and in the North . But whites generally wanted no part of them in their neighborhoods , or in their schools . Long before the 1960s and 1970s , when battles over busing of children to schools erupted in violence , white people in these cities resorted to firebombings and other intimidating tactics . // Federal housing policies in these years deliberately discriminated against blacks seeking low-cost , federally supported home mortgages . Racist to the core , they represented a massive affirmative action program for whites and a major form of de jure discrimination against blacks . Municipal and education officials in the North manipulated zoning regulations , gerrymandered school districts , and built schools next to all-black public housing projects so as to ensure maximum separation of the races in the classroom . They also discriminated against blacks who wished to teach in city schools . San Francisco had no black teachers between the 1870s and 1944 . Philadelphia did not assign a black teacher to a predominantly white high school until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time were placed in schools that were 95 percent or more black . // In the South , the masses of black people  --  most of them still scattered in rural areas  --  had trouble mobilizing effectively in the 1940s and early 1950s . Given the vast reach of Jim Crow , they also had formidable obstacles to overcome . While racial oppression varied in its power  --  the South was not a monolith  --  most white Southerners refused to loosen their grip . During the war , they often treated German prisoners of war better than their own people of color . As Senator Eastland of Mississippi put it , " What the people of this country must realize is that the white race is a superior race , and the Negro race is an inferior race . " Even Myrdal conceded that white people in the South " do not see the handwriting on the wall . They do not study the impending changes ; they live in the pathetic illusion that the matter is settled . " // Firm in their dedication to Jim Crow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixing , as they often called it . Violence , of course , was their ultimate weapon . Lynchings of blacks , while declining in number during the 1940S , remained an ever-present threat . There were sixteen such lynchings officially recorded between 1941 and 1945 , and six more in 1946 alone  --  a sign , some thought , that southern whites proposed to stamp out all traces of postwar black militancy . Most whites in the South feared that mixing would lead to a world in which black men might challenge white domination of life , including decent jobs . Worse , the blacks might socialize or have sex with white women . One white minister asked , " Do black birds intermingle with the blue birds ? Does the redwing fly with the crows ? Would it make sense to mix Black Angus cattle with ... pure-bred Herefords ? " An Alabama state senator exclaimed that the goal of desegregationists was " to open the bedroom doors of our white women to black men . " // The extremes to which such thinking had moved shook the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elmer Henderson , a black man who had brought suit in 1943 against segregated facilities in the Southern Railway 's dining cars . At that time it was common practice in the South to draw a curtain across the dining car near the kitchen and set up a table behind it . Blacks who wished to eat would be served behind the curtain . If whites filled their ( larger ) portion of the car , the curtain would be pulled back , and they would be seated in the " black " section . Blacks who then arrived in the car had to wait until these white people had finished dining , at which point the curtain would be drawn again and they could sit down and eat . " It was as if you were a pig or some kind of animal , " Henderson 's attorney complained . The Court was unanimous in striking down this practice . Henceforth , it ordered , segregated dining facilities on interstate trains were not to be allowed ; everyone who wished to eat in the diner must be free to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very idea of desegregated schools prompted the ugliest imaginable images of racial mixing . No one expressed this feeling more clearly than Herbert Ravenel Sass , a South Carolinian , in the Atlantic Monthly in 1956 : // To suppose that , proclaiming the virtual identity of the races , we can promote all other degrees of race mixing but stop short of interracial mating is  --  if I may use an overworked but vivid simile  --  like going over Niagara Falls in a barrel in the expectation of stopping three fourths of the way down . The South is now the great bulwark against intermarriage . A very few years of thoroughly integrated schools would produce larger numbers of indoctrinated young Southerners free from all " prejudice " against mixed matings. // Confronted with such a wall of racism , activist blacks in the South  --  many of them members of militant local chapters of the NAACP  --  countered by staging voter registration drives and rallying against police brutality . Many ( in the North as well as the South ) concentrated in the late 1940s on uniting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , because strong , interracial unions had the potential  --  or so it appeared  --  to promote an economic and political base for liberal racial policies . These and other assertive acts helped to nourish the roots of civil rights activity that blossomed into a mass movement in later years . But employers mounted strong drives against unions , often tarring them with the brush of communism . And white working-class Americans , like other whites , more often than not proved to be unreliable allies of blacks . After all , only the caste system of Jim Crow separated many poor whites from the masses of poor blacks . As so often in the history of American race relations , the race card trumped the card of class . // For all these reasons , most blacks tended to act cautiously in the late 1940s . The vast majority of black soldiers ( unlike Evers or Jackie Robinson , a well-educated officer who dared to protest against discrimination ) had sullenly abided segregation in the military  --  there was little they could do about it . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that they would encounter the same unyielding system of race relations that they had endured prior to the war . Many , fearful of seeming " uppity " to whites , put on civilian dress before going back to their homes . The story is told of a black soldier about to be mustered out near his home town of Starkville , Mississippi . His father went to the army camp and told him to dress in civilian clothing . He warned his son that if he had any photos of white women in his wallet , he would be killed . // Thus it was that a cadre of black leaders like Thurgood Marshall  --  not black masses  --  tended to dominate the strategies that were employed into the early 1950s to promote change in southern race relations . These leaders , too , acted carefully , relying primarily on legal campaigns that were unavoidably slow . By the late 1940s , Marshall was thinking seriously about confronting segregation head-on . But many other black leaders in local NAACP branches resisted such a move . Some of them could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation in racial mores . Others fretfully wondered : what would desegregation of schools really mean in practice ? And still others , notably teachers , worried that desegregation would destroy black institutions , including schools . The NAACP , they said , should contest inequality , not segregation . It should push to ensure the " equal " part of " separate-but-equal . " Not until 1950 , after much debate within the NAACP , did Marshall dare to demand the demolition of Jim Crow in the schools . // Advocates such as Marshall also had difficulty arousing active backing from white Northerners . Public opinion polls , to be sure , seemed to reveal steadily increasing support among northern whites for liberal policies concerning race : in 1942 , 40 percent of white people in the North believed that " white students and Negro students should go to the same schools " ; by 1956 , 61 percent thought so . ( In the South , 2 percent of whites thought so in 1942 , 15 percent in 1956 . ) But opinions were one thing , actions another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their midst . Imagining that only the South had a " race problem , " they concluded that Southerners , not the federal government , ought to deal with it . Periodic Gallup polls since 1935 had asked people what they considered to be the " most vital issue " of the day . Until 1956 , no more than 4 percent ever answered race relations . Civil rights , Truman 's initiatives notwithstanding , was not a central issue in American electoral politics until the 1960s. // Blacks were quick to recognize and to resent such hypocrisy . Zora Neale Hurston wrote in 1943 , " I laughed to myself watching northerners , after saying to Negro individuals how distressed they were about the awful conditions down South , trying to keep Negroes from too close a contact with themselves .... in some instances , the South is kinder than the North . Then the North adds the insult of insincerity to its coldness . " In 1953 the novelist James Baldwin described the racism that he encountered in New Jersey and Manhattan in the 1940s as being like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is a kind of blind fever , a pounding in the skull and fire in the bowels . " He added , " There is not a Negro alive who does not have rage in his blood . " // Outbursts such as these lead the historian to pose what may seem a heretical question : given the Negrophobia of many whites , and the rage of many blacks , why strive to mix the races , especially in the schools ? Might it have been better for reformers instead to demand an end to racial inequality , rather than of segregation ? Why not press the courts to enforce  --  ? la Plessy  --  facilities for blacks that were truly equal ? Several southern states , finally seeing a little of the handwriting on the wall , were in fact taking frightened steps to improve black schools during the early 1950s . They were far readier , it was clear , to move against educational inequality than they were to consider desegregation. // Hurston was not the only black person who worried about the wisdom of combating desegregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken against racism , also had harbored doubts , notably expressed in a controversial essay in 1935 , " Does the Negro Need Separate Schools ? " In answering his question , Du Bois admitted that " no general and inflexible rule can be laid down . " " Theoretically the Negro needs neither segregated schools nor mixed schools . What he needs is Education . " But Du Bois , a founder of the NAACP in 1909 and until the 1930s a forceful crusader for integration , had become disillusioned and edged on this issue toward black separatism . " Race prejudice in the United States , " he wrote , " is such that most Negroes can not receive proper education in white institutions . " He added : // A separate Negro school , where children are treated like human beings , trained by teachers of their own race , who know what it means to be black ... is infinitely better than making our boys and girls doormats to be spit and trampled upon and lied to by ignorant social climbers , whose sole claim to superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . // Neither in 1935 nor later did Du Bois 's ideas about schools command majority support among black leaders . The NAACP stayed committed to a desegregated society . Later leaders such as the Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr. , who was far and away the most revered black spokesman during his lifetime , not only demanded the end of Jim Crow ; he also dared to dream of interracial harmony . Du Bois 's essay nonetheless articulated a stubbornly persistent minority view , one that seemed especially attractive to many blacks during periods of rising interracial tension . They were sure that blacks in mixed schools dominated by whites would always be looked down on and made to feel inferior . Many children would be miserable . // Advocates of desegregated schools , however , retorted  --  then and later  --  with formidable replies . Yes , they said , there were a number of very excellent , academically rigorous black schools  --  in Washington , among other places . They emphasize , however , that most black children living in the South and border states before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desegregated public schools . The children were required to attend all-black schools in parts of twenty-one states , and everywhere in the South . The system , moreover , was not only segregated ; it also featured glaring inequalities in spending per pupil , facilities , and the training of teachers  --  indeed , in every way . In part because of such inequality and in part because of widespread poverty among blacks , African-American parents were much more likely than white parents to pull their children out of school at a young age . As late as 1940 the median number of years of schooling for blacks age twenty-five or older in the segregating states and the District of Columbia was five , as opposed to 8.5 for whites . Perhaps one-fourth of American blacks at the time were functionally illiterate . " Separate-but- equal " remained a far-off dream before 1954 , especially in the Deep South . // Many liberal crusaders for change in the late 1940s , moreover , were losing interest in seeking **25;327;TOOLONG . Some concluded that equality was simply impossible to achieve so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  especially in the schools and in the armed forces  --  promoted tolerance . Still others thought that bringing black children into classroom contact with white children from better educational backgrounds would improve the academic performance of the blacks , which was far below that of white students in a variety of ways . Reformers argued also that segregated schools cut blacks off from valuable networks that whites enjoyed , thereby worsening job discrimination and poverty . // Proponents of desegregated schools pressed many other points . Jim Crow in education , they emphasized , violated constitutional guarantees ( in the Fourteenth Amendment ) of equal protection under the law . It also deprived black parents of a basic right : to send their children to neighborhood schools , including schools that were predominantly white , if they so wished . Critics of Jim Crow further stressed that whites had erected a segregated and discriminatory system with the deliberate intent not only of preventing interracial contact but also of keeping black people in servile positions . " When they blacks learn to spell dog and cat , " whites said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for black people were especially bad  --  indeed primitive  --  in many rural regions . Sunflower County , Mississippi , a cotton plantation region ( where Senator Eastland owned thousands of acres ) , had no high school for blacks . In the elementary grades of the county 's black schools , many of the teachers worked primarily as cooks or domestics on the plantations . Most had no more than a fourth-grade education themselves . Mae Bertha Carter , who was to become a stubborn champion of integrated schools in the area during the 1960s , remembered growing up in the 1930s on one of these plantations , near Drew , Mississippi . A sharecropper 's child , she was expected to tend to the cotton and was allowed to go to her elementary school only in the three winter months when there was relatively little for a child to do in the fields . Her fourth-grade teacher , who did not understand mathematical fractions , coped with forty to fifty children at a time . Mae Bertha left school after the fifth grade , scantily educated but with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most southern whites , regarding education of blacks as a waste of time , had no interest in reforming this system . " A million years from now , " they said , " a nigger will still be a nigger in the South . " // Many city schools for blacks in the South were little better . In Atlanta during the 1940s , overcrowding in black elementary schools led to double sessions that limited children to three hours per day . Many black children roved the streets during the rest of the time . In the 1948-49 school year , the average investment per pupil in Atlanta public school facilities was $228.05 for blacks , $570 for whites . In 1949  --  50 there was an average of 36.2 black children per classroom , compared to an average of 22.6 among whites . Only after 1950 , when the NAACP brought suit against segregation , did worried city and school officials build new facilities so as to claim that they were meeting the constitutional principle of separate-but-truly-equal . Disgusted blacks called these hastily constructed buildings " Supreme Court schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed a major component of a larger conspiracy of white supremacy that attempted to suppress a whole category of people . It stigmatized blacks , as Justice Harlan had said in Plessy , with a " badge of inferiority . " The system of segregated schools , like the broader institution of Jim Crow that pervaded the South , made all white people complicit in a wickedness that was deliberate , and it fostered rising resentment and anger among black people . Racial segregation  --  and the inequality that had long been associated with it  --  was an evil for people of all colors. // * * * // The man who took the lead in litigating against this evil , Thurgood Marshall , turned forty-two in 1950 , the year that he and his team of attorneys decided to challenge segregation head-on . Tall and sturdy  --  around six-feet-two and 200 pounds  --  he had thick , wavy black hair combed straight back and a narrow , triangular moustache . Some people mistook him for Representative Adam Clayton Powell , Jr. , the light-skinned Negro politician who represented a Harlem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown up in West Baltimore , raised by proud and hardworking parents of mixed racial background . Some of his ancestors had been slaves . By the standards of black America , Marshall 's family was middle class . His father had been a dining car waiter for the New York Central railroad and then served as head steward of an all-white yacht club on Chesapeake Bay ; his mother was an elementary school teacher in an all-black school . Attending the Colored High and Training School , Marshall learned from experience what inequality meant . The school had no library , cafeteria , auditorium , or gym . A tiny brick-paved yard in the back served as a playground . Crowding was so great that the school had to run half-day sessions . Marshall did well as a student , and then went to Lincoln University in nearby Pennsylvania , which had a black student body and a white faculty . Resentfully giving up hope of attending the University of Maryland Law School  --  it excluded blacks  --  he went to Howard University Law School in Washington , D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks who advanced in the practice of law after 1930 , Howard provided an invaluable education . Led by Charles Houston , its passionate , demanding dean , the school maintained high educational standards . Marshall idolized Houston , who saw litigation as the key to better civil rights for black people . " It all started with Charlie , " he said later . When he graduated as a star student in 1933 , he went to work as counsel for the Baltimore branch of the NAACP . In 1936 he moved to New York as assistant to Houston , who was then national counsel for the NAACP . Two years later , when Houston returned to private practice , Marshall took over the top job . He was then only thirty years old . The next year he helped found the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund . The LDF , or the " Inc . Fund , " or " Fund , " as it was often called , shared office space with the NAACP in New York City but was largely autonomous after 1941 . It formally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fund led an increasingly focused attack on racial discrimination . // Some of the more urbane black attorneys who worked under Marshall in these years considered him to be a bit earthy for their taste . Although he ordinarily talked with a gentle southern accent and in refined language , he could switch on a " Rastus " dialect at the drop of a hat . ( " Axe " for " ask , " " substantual " for " substantial , " lots of double negatives and " deses " and " dats . " ) Other assistants , such as his impatient top aide , Robert Carter , urged him to move more rapidly against racial segregation . Franklin Williams , another assistant , remembered that Marshall " knew where cases had to move , which ones would and should move , and how to move them , but more often than not cases were undertaken reluctantly . Thurgood had to be convinced of victory beyond a reasonable doubt before he said yes . " // Notwithstanding such differences over tactics , these and other assistants deeply admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organization like the shakily funded , thinly staffed Defense Fund . Appreciating the enormous , highly expensive task of challenging Jim Crow , they understood that they had to pick cases very carefully . Plaintiffs must be responsible , upright , steadfast local citizens , preferably people who had jobs ( as Pullman porters , or federally protected mailmen , for instance ) that shielded them a little from white retaliation . Marshall also stressed the importance of bringing suits in communities where there was substantial support among local blacks  --  and , if possible , where there were some home-grown black lawyers who might help the " outsiders " from the Fund in New York . // Marshall 's fellow lawyers especially admired the skill that he displayed as a listener during preparatory meetings that fashioned courtroom strategies . Williams recalled , " He had great success in picking people 's brains and manipulating them in the interests of a cause . He 'd get a lot of outside lawyers together in a room , and he 'd be talking and laughing and drinking along with the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd seem to be having such a good time with them that you would n't think he was listening . But after they 'd left , there it all was  --  he 'd had the benefit of all their brains , which was his strategy in the first place . " // Marshall was particularly skilled at maintaining morale among his co-workers  --  not an easy task given the obstacles they faced . " I never had so much fun in my life , " one top-level attorney remembered of the long and otherwise exhausting strategy sessions that Marshall conducted in preparing for Brown . A gifted raconteur , Marshall enjoyed engaging in repartee with his fellow lawyers , who had fun calling him " No good " and " Turkie . " He often relied on humor , some of it calculated to shock white lawyers . When leading a discussion of the Supreme Court 's power to rule in the segregation cases , he leaned forward and acted as if he were addressing the judges in court : " White bosses , you can do any thing you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion he jolted Alfred Kelly , a white professor of history , by playfully turning to a secretary at the Fund and asking if she had forgotten who " de H.N. " was around there . " H.N. , " Kelly learned in surprise , stood for " Head Nigger. " // While use of the word " nigger " bothered some of the attorneys with the Fund , they also understood that this was Marshall 's manner  --  a way , perhaps , of relieving tensions . Moreover , he had a common touch that endeared him to people , especially the southern blacks who endangered their livelihoods and sometimes their lives to sign on as plaintiffs against racist practices . These were the people to whom Marshall often spoke in black dialect . They knew also that Marshall himself was risking his life . By the late 1940s he was traveling thousands of miles a year in the South , where he was careful not to violate Jim Crow practices . " I 've got back trouble , you know , " he said . " A big yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal expertise , and his common touch made him known as " Mr. Civil Rights " by 1950. // Marshall and others undertook many kinds of cases between 1939 , when the Fund was founded , and the early 1950s . At the end of 1951 , for instance , they were involved in twenty elementary and high school segregation cases , a dozen higher education cases , five in housing , five against white-run railway and bus companies , a half dozen in recreation ( mainly against segregated golf courses ) , one voting case , two battles over discriminatory teachers ' salaries , a huge number of courts martial , and eleven major criminal cases . Jack Greenberg , a young attorney with the Fund , said later of these criminal matters , " Those with a sex factor loomed large , partly because of the death penalty for rape . Southern irrationality about interracial sex made all such charges suspect . " // Suits involving public education held center stage at Fund headquarters . As early as 1931 , the NAACP had decided to concentrate on such cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately better the lot of black students in the segregating states . Several considerations prompted adoption of this key decision , which many years later meant that high profile school segregation cases were among the first to reach the level of the Supreme Court . First , it made sense to aim at discrimination in public , not private facilities , which thanks to constitutional precedents were presumed to be safer from legal attack . The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution , ratified in 1868 during the era of Reconstruction , stipulated that states  --  public bodies  --  should not make or enforce laws abridging the " privileges or immunities " of United States citizens . Further , a state must not deprive any person of " life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . " // Relying heavily on the Fourteenth Amendment , the NAACP  --  and later the Fund  --  aimed first at racist practices in publicly supported graduate and professional schools . Here the discrimination was especially glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accredited medical school for blacks in the South  --  Meharry in Nashville  --  as opposed to twenty-nine for whites , and only one provisionally accredited law school , as opposed to forty for whites . Nowhere in the South could a black person study for a doctorate . Racially discriminatory law schools , NAACP leaders thought , were especially promising targets , mainly because white judges knew from their personal experience as students what a good law school had to have in the way of facilities and professors . Marshall especially hoped that southern states , if forced in time to set up separate-but-truly-equal black law and professional schools , might balk at the high cost of well-supported dual institutions and consolidate instead . // In the 1930s and 1940s Marshall and his allies did not challenge the " separate " part of the separate-but-equal test established by Plessy in 1896 . Such a strategy , of course , would have targeted segregation itself  --  an institutionalized system so well entrenched as to seem impregnable at that time . Instead , the NAACP tried to make segregating states live up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such equality , the NAACP concentrated its efforts between 1936 and 1938 in support of Lloyd Gaines , a graduate in 1935 of Missouri 's state-supported black college , Lincoln University , who then applied for admission to the University of Missouri Law School . The university refused , rejecting him solely on the grounds of his race . It offered instead to set up a separate " law school " for him at Lincoln or to pay any tuition in excess of what he would have been charged if he had enrolled at the University of Missouri , so that he might attend a law school in an adjacent state that would take him . At the time , law schools in Kansas , Nebraska , Iowa , and Illinois accepted out-of-state black graduates . Refusing to tolerate such an arrangement , Gaines sued to compel the University of Missouri to admit him . // The Gaines case , like many that the NAACP handled , was expensive , time-consuming , and frustrating . Lower courts supported Missouri 's discriminatory actions . In December 1938 , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's favor . Writing for the majority , Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes said that " a privilege has been created for white students which is denied to Negroes by reason of their race . " Gaines , he added , " was entitled to the equal protection of the laws , and the State was bound to furnish him within its borders facilities for legal education " that were equal to those offered to whites . // This was an encouraging victory for the principle of separate-but-truly-equal  --  one that foes of discrimination frequently cited in later lawsuits . But Missouri then began to set up what was plainly an ill-funded , inferior law school for blacks , thereby forcing the NAACP to resume the fight . At this point , early in 1939 , Gaines simply disappeared from view , never to surface again . No one knew then  --  or later  --  what happened to him . Some thought that he had been murdered , others that he had become miffed at the NAACP and accepted a bribe to disappear . Whatever the truth , the NAACP no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was a sad ending to several years of expensive litigation . It was also testimony to the formidable difficulties that stood in the way of legal strategies against Jim Crow . // Marshall and his colleagues nonetheless kept trying , and they were finally rewarded in June 1950  --  twelve years after Gaines  --  when the Supreme Court again ruled in their favor in two more higher education cases . The first backed the efforts of Heman Sweatt , a Houston mail carrier who had been rejected on racial grounds in 1946 when he sought admission to the state 's all-white law school . Instead , the state set up a poorly supported " law school " for blacks in a basement . Sweatt fought back , not only against the state of Texas but also , over time , against briefs filed in support of Texas by eleven southern and border states . After litigation in four different courts , Marshall pleaded Sweatt 's case before a packed Supreme Court chamber in April 1950 . In June the Supreme Court held unanimously that it could not " find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law students by the state . " Because Sweatt had no chance of an equal legal education in the state 's pathetically inadequate law school for blacks , he was ordered admitted to the University of Texas Law School . This was the first time that the Court had told a state to admit a black person to an all-white educational institution . // On the same day the Court also supported the quest of George McLaurin , a sixty-eight-year-old black teacher who had applied in 1948 to get a doctorate in education at the all-white University of Oklahoma . The state reluctantly admitted him in 1949 but forced him to remain in an anteroom off the regular classrooms where course work was given . In the library he was made to sit at a segregated desk behind a pile of newspapers in the mezzanine . In the cafeteria he had to eat in a dingy alcove by himself and at a different hour from the whites . McLaurin testified that it was " quite strange and humiliating to be placed out in that position , and it handicaps me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided unanimously that Oklahoma 's actions " impair and inhibit McLaurin 's ability to study , to engage in discussion and exchange views with other students , and , in general , to learn his profession . " // For the Fund these were heartening decisions , the more so because the Court also ruled on that day , in the Henderson case , against segregated dining on interstate trains . Moreover , the Truman administration 's solicitor general , Philip Pearlman , had backed the Fund by filing a brief as a " friend of the court " in these cases . The way now seemed clear for the Fund to fight against racial discrimination not only in graduate and professional schools but also across the board . Even more encouraging to Marshall was the Court 's reasoning , especially in Sweatt . In defending their exclusion of Sweatt from the white law school , Texas officials maintained that its new black law school had equal facilities . It had comparable floor space , and it gave blacks access to the state law library . The Court , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality " and listed a number of other assets , some of them intangible , that the black school lacked . Black students , for instance , were denied contact with white law students and professors ; they had no well-established alumni to turn to for placement ; they would earn a law degree far less prestigious than whites received at their school . With reasoning such as this the Court was all but saying that racially separate law schools within a state could not be equal . Recognizing this thrust , Marshall wrote a friend , " All three of the decisions are replete with road markings telling us where to go next . " // But Marshall moved cautiously . After all , the cases had taken years  --  since 1943 in the Henderson case . During Sweatt 's four-year battle for admission to the UT Law School he had no choice but to continue working as a mailman . McLaurin , a dignified , experienced educator , had been humiliated . More important , Chief Justice Fred Vinson , a Kentucky moderate , and his colleagues on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were doing . Vinson couched the opinions in careful language chosen so as to call for truly equal education only at the graduate level and so as not to offend southern sensibilities . Indeed , the decisions sustained Plessy v. Ferguson , which had established the constitutionality of separate-but-equal racial segregation . // The Sweatt and McLaurin decisions , moreover , did not have a large impact . Texas admitted Sweatt , who had to deal with intimidation from whites . A cross was burned next to his car , and his tires were slashed . He became ill and flunked out . The school took in only a handful of black students later in the 1950s . And the decisions did not change much else , for the segregating states maintained their barriers . Undergraduate education was unaffected . While several southern states , notably South Carolina , embarked on crash programs to improve black public schools , none even considered plans for gradual desegregation . If Marshall expected to ensure full equality under such segregated circumstances , he faced the task of arguing case after case in state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fund . // Considering this gloomy prospect , Marshall and others understandably considered sailing off on a different tack : litigating to overturn segregation itself . In many ways , of course , this was an alluring course , especially because true equality within a Jim Crow system was impossible . But targeting segregation continued to be frightening as well , especially for the black principals , teachers , coaches , and other school employees who might lose their jobs if Jim Crow in education were to be abolished . ( Contending with blacks of this persuasion , Marshall observed , " the easy part of the job is fighting the white folks . " ) It also seemed likely that a challenge against segregation would take years before being heard or decided by the High Court . And what if the challenge were to fail ? The Court , badly divided on many issues in 1950 , might reject his arguments , thereby reaffirming Plessy and further solidifying the constitutionality of segregated facilities . For Marshall and his fellow advocates in 1950 , a fateful choice lay ahead .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
