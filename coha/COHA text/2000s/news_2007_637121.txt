<p> Tim Xia was in New York on business when he got an e-mail from an old college chum . A Chinese businessman wanted to fight a patent infringement lawsuit , the friend said , and needed a lawyer . Was Xia interested ? <p> Minutes later , billionaire entrepreneur Wusheng Chen phoned Xia and invited him to lunch in Times Square . Over a meal of sweet and salty fish  --  pigs ' feet , Chen 's favorite , was n't on the menu  --  Xia sketched out a legal strategy . The attorney with Morris , Manning &; Martin of Atlanta caught a 5 p.m. flight home , unsure if he had Chen 's business . <p> Upon landing at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport , though , Xia had a message from Chen summoning him back to New York the next day . <p> Three years , hundreds of meetings and countless frequent-flier miles later , Xia 's courtship of Chen paid off big time for Georgia . <p> What started with an unsatisfactory lunch in July 2004 culminated Friday with Chen 's announcement of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recruitment of General Protecht , a maker of electrical components , offers a textbook example of the importance of guanxi , or the art of relationship-building so critical to luring Chinese businesses across the Pacific . <p> Tax breaks , inexpensive land and the growing Southeast market , of course , played huge roles in landing the manufacturer touted as a harbinger of a Chinese investment onslaught . But a slew of personal contacts helped seal the deal . It is questionable whether , without a crystal peach , the Cheetah Lounge , a skeet-shooting expedition and Nancy Musselwhite 's potato salad , Wusheng Chen would 've chosen Georgia . <p> " It 's all about relationships , " said Hans Gant , senior vice president of economic development for the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce . " If you do n't build a level of trust , then all of the facts do n't matter . And it takes a lot of people to build a solid foundation . " <p> Wooing Chen <p> Xia returned to New York with two of his firm 's partners . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squirrel fish . Yang zhou fried rice . <p> " We had a much better meal , " Xia said . <p> Chen asked Morris , Manning to represent him as an intervenor in the intellectual property case . Chen 's side prevailed . But the plaintiff , Leviton Corp. , a New York-based electrical components manufacturer , turned its legal guns on Chen 's company , Zheijian Dongzheng Electrical Co . <p> Leviton claimed Dongzheng infringed on its patent for ground fault circuit interrupters  --  the devices that prevent electric shocks . Xia , naturally , disputes the allegation and insists Leviton " just wants to slow down our client 's entry or expansion into the United States . " The attorney pointed to a favorable , preliminary ruling in the ongoing case as proof of Dongzheng 's innocence . ( Leviton officials did n't return calls last week . ) <p> Meanwhile , Chen began considering a manufacturing plant in the United States to be closer to distributors , retailers and customers . China 's Communist leadership , flush with $1 trillion in cash reserves , was loosening restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also ease criticism from Washington over its trade deficit , now pegged at $232 billion , with China . <p> Fortuitous meeting <p> Chen visited Atlanta  --  a city he knew nothing about  --  in May 2005 to meet with his distributors . Xia also introduced Chen to former Gov . Roy Barnes , Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin and chamber President Sam Williams . <p> But a get-together with Sam Zamarripa , a managing partner with Heritage Capital Advisors , proved to be the most fortuitous stop on Chen 's Atlanta itinerary . <p> Zamarripa , a former state senator with a global perspective , pushed Heritage to embrace China . Chen , who had outgrown the China market , needed guidance and partners to enter the lucrative but competitive U.S. market . Enter Heritage . <p> " The first thing you do with any relationship with someone from China is you establish a friendship , and that 's what we did , " said John Ray , the private equity firm 's president who visited Chen twice in 2005 . On the second trip , Ray left Shanghai  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep talking . Ray said he was only free Saturday night . Chen flew to Beijing to drink green tea in a hotel bar with Ray that evening . <p> " We could n't come to an agreement , " Ray said . " We had to get to know each other some more . " <p> Invitation to China <p> Chen invited Ray , Xia and his colleague , Jeffrey Schulte , to Wenzhou for the groundbreaking of his new factory in January 2006 . Many of China 's business , political and media elite also attended . Musicians , acrobats and soldiers firing confetti from mortars entertained at the red carpet affair . <p> Ray presented Chen with a letter from Franklin and a crystal peach " so that he could put that up on his shelf to remind him of Georgia . " <p> Chen , honored by his guests ' appearance , had found his American financial partners and legal team . The U.S. market awaited . All he needed was a place to build a factory . <p> Officials with the metro chamber , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chen 's arrival in Atlanta three months later . <p> Helicopter tour <p> The chamber gave Chen a helicopter tour of Atlanta and the region . It helped arrange meetings for Chen with distributors , developers , builders and Home Depot . It also hosted a reception for Chen atop its downtown office building . <p> Schulte , the Morris , Manning partner , took Chen skeet shooting . Business , not pleasure , though , dictated Chen 's trip . <p> The recruiters gave the Georgia spiel : customers within a day or two 's drive of Atlanta ; proximity to Hartsfield , the port of Savannah and the interstates ; Southeast housing starts ; Fortune 500 companies headquartered in Atlanta ; tax incentives offered by state and local communities . <p> The competition was tough . In addition to a dozen sites along I-75 and I-16 , Chen was wooed by South Carolina , Ohio and Utah . The Georgians , though , felt they had the upper hand . Chen told Franklin he wanted to build a factory  --  and possibly an industrial park  --  in Atlanta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> River cruise <p> On a rainy night in Shanghai , Chen chartered a cruise ship for a trip along the Huangpu River with 100 top government , business and media officials . He invited Franklin , chamber officials and Robert Saudek , managing partner of Morris , Manning , along for the September 2006 ride . Chen told the chamber-sponsored delegation  --  in China to recruit business , a consulate for Atlanta and a direct Delta Air Lines flight  --  that Georgia would house his U.S. factory . <p> " The details were still up in the air  --  does he have customers , what location will he pick ? " Gant recalled . " But it was just a matter of us meeting his needs . " <p> Chen , 55 , returned to Georgia in late November to focus on site selection . He needed 25 acres  --  later raised to 200 acres  --  near Atlanta . He visited the Georgia Resource Center , run by Georgia Power , to peruse available locations around the state and learn about possible incentives . <p> He flew via helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with businessman and GOP bigwig Guy Millner at the Ritz-Carlton in Buckhead to " learn how to do business here , " Ray said . Chen was also introduced to Atlanta cultural and social amenities . <p> Potato salad , strip club <p> The National Association of Chinese-Americans sponsored a dinner in Chen 's honor at the Canton House on Buford Highway . Musselwhite , who works for the chamber , served Chen her famous potato salad . The entrepreneur now requests potato salad at all Georgia restaurants . <p> One night Chen joined Xia and others at the Cheetah . Unable to communicate with table dancers , Chen vowed that before his next strip club visit he would " learn English by heart , " Xia said . <p> The entrepreneur had narrowed possible factory sites to Lamar , Spalding and Butts counties . Atlanta , unable to provide a suitable plot of land within city limits , was crossed off the list . <p> Chen returned to Georgia in February to visit the finalists . Once he saw the Barnesville site , Ray said , Chen 's search was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chen makes decisions as much from his gut as his head , " Ray said . " There 's a pretty significant body of water there . Water is a sign of abundance and prosperity in China . It 's good feng shui . " <p> Roughly $10 million in state and local tax breaks also helped Chen make up his mind . So , too , did three years ' worth of assiduous courtship by Georgia officials . <p> " We 're dealing with a country that 's going through tremendous change , " Gant said . " We 're dealing with an environment we 've never dealt with before . We had to sell ourselves to the company as well as to the government . That 's something we had to learn along the way .
