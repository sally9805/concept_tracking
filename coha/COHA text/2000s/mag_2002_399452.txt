According to Recipe Development Director Mary Allen Perry , a lightly greased 10-cup ring mold works just fine . " Dip the mold in warm water ( be careful not to submerge it ) for 15 to 20 seconds , and the salad will release much more easily , " she says . Any longer , and the gelatin will begin to melt . She also suggests buying bags of cranberries in season and storing them in the freezer so you can enjoy the salad year-round . // <p>
