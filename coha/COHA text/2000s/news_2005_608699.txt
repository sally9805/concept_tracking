<p> In a decision that is sending shudders through the estate planning and life insurance worlds , a federal judge has ruled a multimillion-dollar life insurance policy in Maryland void because it was owned by a trust . In the judge 's view , Maryland law bars a trust from having an " insurable interest " in a person . <p> That legal interpretation , if sustained on appeal and widely applied , would undermine a key estate planning strategy , which takes advantage of the fact that the payout from life insurance policies not owned by the insured person can escape both income and estate taxes . It is common practice to place life policies , especially large ones , in irrevocable trusts . <p> Planners have been using this strategy for decades , and today the vast majority of large cash-value insurance policies are sold to trusts , experts say . <p> This ruling  --  finding a policy held in trust to be void  --  " is going to set the financial planning community on its head , " said Washington attorney William H. Crispin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy was rejected by the insurance company . <p> The ruling , agreeing with a defense raised by the insurance company , is based on Maryland law , but a half-dozen other states have statutes worded much like Maryland 's , Crispin said . <p> The case involved what one attorney called " weird facts , " which officials of the American Council of Life Insurers , a trade group , and Maryland insurance regulators said may limit the ruling 's impact . Also , an appeal is pending . <p> But others who have seen the ruling by U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria find it alarming . <p> " It could turn out to be a bad thing , or be completely ignored , " said Alan L. Meltzer of the Meltzer Group in Bethesda , which specializes in high-end insurance policies for estate planning and other purposes . But " it 's dangerous because another court could " decide to follow it , he said . <p> Estate planning lawyer Frederick J. Tansill of McLean called the ruling " very troubling . " <p> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even trillions , of dollars of life insurance on the wealthiest Americans may be in doubt , " Tansill said . " This is frankly an unimaginable result . " <p> The case involved a man named Harald Giesinger , who set up a trust in 1995 naming himself and friend Vera Chawla as trustees . In 2000 , Giesinger and Chawla , according to the judge 's opinion , first sought to buy a $1 million life insurance policy on Giesinger from Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Co. , naming Chawla as the policy 's owner and beneficiary . But the company refused to issue the policy , saying that Chawla did not have an insurable interest in Giesinger . <p> So the application was changed to make Giesinger 's trust the owner and beneficiary , and Transamerica issued the policy . Later that year , the policy value was increased to $2.45 million . <p> However , the court found , Giesinger misrepresented his health condition in both the original application and the application for the increase . His applications failed to mention that he had undergone surgery for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Giesinger died in September 2001 . Transamerica refused to pay the trust 's claim , and Chawla as trustee sued . Although Chawla was a Maryland resident , the case was brought in federal court in Virginia because the policy was sold in that state . However , Hilton based his decision on Maryland law because the policy documents were delivered to Chawla in that state and the first premium was paid there . <p> Hilton found for Transamerica on the issue of misrepresentation , but continued , " . . . Even absent a material misrepresentation , plaintiff 's claim necessarily fails as a matter of law because the trust maintained no insurable interest in the life of the decedent thus rendering the policy void . " <p> In general , someone has an insurable interest in someone else if he or she would suffer a loss  --  financial or certain other kinds  --  upon the other person 's death . Relatives are generally regarded as having insurable interests in one another . In business , life insurance can be written on key employees , executives or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of the requirement is to prevent people from , in effect , speculating on the lives of others . <p> Insurable interest became an issue a few years ago with the discovery that some big companies were buying insurance on all their employees with the company as beneficiary and , in some cases , turning it into a tax shelter . The Internal Revenue Service successfully challenged some of the shelters , and regulators in some states have ruled that companies do n't have an insurable interest in low-level workers . <p> Judge Hilton found that an insurable interest may exist under Maryland law " where one has ' a lawful and substantial economic interest in the continuation of the life health and bodily safety of the individual . ' " <p> " This section contains the caveat , however , that ' an interest that arises only by , or would be enhanced in value by , the death , disablement or injury of the individual is not an insurable interest , ' " Hilton added . <p> He then found that the trust would have gained more  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would from his continued life . " Further , " he said , " the trust suffered no detriment , pecuniary or otherwise , upon the death of " Giesinger . <p> " While the case could have been decided , rightly or wrongly , on the question of the failure of the insured to fully disclose his physical condition , that is not the way the court ruled , " Tansill said . " The court ruled that even if the insurance was validly obtained and there was no question as to the disclosure about the physical condition of the insured , the trustee would still not be able to collect on the policy , because of this lack of insurable interest problem . " <p> Even more mysterious to Crispin , Tansill and others is why Transamerica raised the insurable interest argument in the case . <p> " This defense is unprecedented . There 's no reported case in the country where an insurance company has defended on this ground . It make no sense to defend on this ground " because of the potential effect on trust-owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on the case . A spokeswoman said the company does not comment on pending litigation . <p> The trust also owned Giesinger 's house and allowed him to receive income from trust assets . It also did not specifically permit the purchase of life insurance , though it did grant broad powers to the trustees . <p> These oddities in the trust  --  which Tansill said likely would have undermined its tax benefits  --  along with the misrepresentation will probably be enough to prevent the case from being extendable to others , according to the life insurance council and Maryland insurance regulators . <p> Crispin said he does n't see how those factors are relevant to Hilton 's holding on the insurance interest . But the trust is appealing the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit , which could overturn some or all of it . <p> A federal judge in Oregon sentenced three people connected with the " Christian Patriot Association " to prison after they were convicted of tax fraud , the Justice Department said . The warehouse bank they were operating allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions that were virtually untraceable , the department said . <p> Richard George Flowers was sentenced to 50 month in prison ; Dorothy Lenore Flowers drew three years ' probation , and Jeffrey Allen Weakley 30 months in prison . <p> The warehouse bank provided anonymous banking services to some 900 members nationwide and handled deposits of more than $186 million , the government said . <p> More than three of four Americans say they will be better prepared financially for retirement than their parents , according to a survey by Fidelity Investments . Young adults , age 21 to 34 , are more confident than those 35 to 54 , the survey found . Parents ' biggest mistake : waiting too long to start saving .
