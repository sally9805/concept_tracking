Section : AT WAR The song of the ' counter-tribalists ' <p> ' Who is responsible for the attack on the World Trade Center ? " I was asked on Counterspin , Canada 's version of Crossfire . <p> " The men who hijacked the planes and flew them into the buildings , and those who financed and assisted them , " I replied . <p> It was the wrong answer . <p> Another guest swiftly explained that though the terrorists were indeed partly to blame , we must understand that they were themselves responding to deeper causes-the general poverty and hopelessness of Afghanistan and many other Muslim countries , of course , but also America 's interventions in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf . By joining Pakistan in supporting the more fundamentalist mujahedin in the 1980s and then leaving postwar Afghanistan to fend for itself , the U.S. had helped to create the Taliban . And by basing infidel American troops in Saudi Arabia near the Muslim holy places during the Gulf War , the U.S. drove Osama bin Laden to transform himself into the Ford Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blame for the terrorist attacks of September 11 . <p> Now , there are reasonable criticisms of U.S. foreign policy embedded in that argument , for my fellow guests on Counterspin were in the main reasonable . Even so , that particular mixture of arguments does not even begin to establish some remote American responsibility for the acts of terrorism . It slyly implies that the U.S. spontaneously erupted into Afghanistan and the Gulf , when in fact the U.S. involved itself in Afghanistan in response to the Soviet occupation of that country , and placed troops in the Gulf to reverse the invasion of Kuwait-acting in both cases at the request of Muslim and Arab powers . It glosses over the fact that the U.S. was following Pakistan 's lead in supporting Afghan fundamentalists for the practical reason that the U.S. , which is not omnipotent , needed Pakistan 's help in assisting the Afghan resistance . And it generally exaggerates America 's capacity for either harm or good , by blaming the U.S. for the poverty and backwardness of Arab and Muslim countries , including Afghanistan , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies to generate civil institutions , sensible economic policies , or free democratic governments ( or , in the case of Afghanistan , any kind of stable government at all ) . In the light of such persistent systemic failures , it is perverse to blame America for not imposing political and economic enlightenment on these societies-the more so when we all know that America would instantly be denounced for cultural imperialism if it tried to do so . <p> But the Canadian audience did not really want to hear such an exculpation . It did not want to place the blame for over 6,000 violent deaths on the shoulders of the terrorists alone . Nor was this because it was composed of Muslims or anti-Americans ( though there were probably some of both present ) . You would have had a very similar reaction from almost any Ivy League audience . Or from the League of Women Voters . Or from a session of Americans for Democratic Action . Or from a town meeting in almost any college town or gentrified urban area in the U.S. For in the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority but still large-for arguments that combine two factors : a tendency to self-blame and a taste for complex causal explanations , preferably made still more complex by social-science jargon . <p> Examine some of the " anti-American " remarks made since September 11 . Here , for instance , is a columnist in the student newspaper at the University of Michigan . Its author is a young man , of course , but his reflections mirror more senior academic opinion , as well as the opinions of Susan Sontag , Michael Moore , and the rest of the usual suspects . If it seems harsh to single him out for criticism here , remember that he will be extravagantly praised by those suspects for his idealism in penning these thoughts : <p> If the leadership of this country has its way , a dangerous cycle will be allowed to continue . It is one in which America makes enemies abroad , via broken treaties , unattended summits , and tyrannical international policing . Terrorism follows , allowing leaders to call for appropriations to " fix " our national defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning . Funding the military at this point is a band-aid solution to a more complex problem . <p> Ah yes , as the English critic John Gross has remarked : " Complexity is the first refuge of the scoundrel . " If indeed the World Trade Center was attacked because the U.S. withdrew from the Kyoto treaty , then the primary suspects are presumably the German and French " Green " parties , which were the bodies most enthusiastic about it . The Muslim countries were either indifferent to it , or nervously skeptical ( some oil-producing countries ) , or outspokenly hostile ( Malaysia ) . But our student strategist does not wish to place even partial or subsidiary blame for the attack on anyone but America . In his formulation , no one actually does the terrorism ; it merely " follows " from some prior American beastliness , such as withdrawing from an international conference booming with anti-Semitic rhetoric . The terrorists themselves were not active protagonists in this scenario ; they merely went through certain motions that American diplomacy had set in train , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. , when it retaliates , will enjoy no such excuse : Any response to the World Trade Center attack will be seen as a free and premeditated act of " tyrannical international policing . " <p> In the immediate aftermath of the murder of more than 6,000 Americans , such comments have been relatively rare and muted in the U.S. They have been more common abroad : Fintan O'Toole in the Irish Times describing the U.S. as " merciless and arrogant " ; the British New Statesman explaining that the Americans deserved to be bombed because they had voted for Bush , and even Gore , rather than for Ralph Nader ; Edward Said in the London Observer unmasking the naive American concepts of " freedom and terrorism " as " large abstractions that have mostly hidden sordid material interests , the influence of the oil , defense and Zionist lobbies now consolidating their hold on the entire Middle East , and an age-old religious hostility to ( and ignorance of ) ' Islam ' that takes new forms every day " ; an entire stable of Guardian writers all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn from this painful episode why they are " hated " ; and almost all of this vile nonsense written in falsely neutral or sympathetic tones behind which a passionate hostility is barely held in check , like a Freudian psychoanalyst explaining to a patient of whom he is secretly and viciously jealous the valid reasons why no one likes him . <p> When such comments appear , we are reasonably inclined to describe them as uncomplicatedly " anti-American . " But it would be mistaken to see them as exhibiting a foreign nationalist rejection of American influence . Such feelings do exist , of course : sometimes in diplomatic or European bureaucracies , sometimes in intellectual coteries like the High Tory historians who blame the U.S. for the decline of the British Empire . But these are minority reactions . Most anti-American diatribes of the kind quoted above come from people who dislike their own country almost as much as they dislike America . Indeed , their dislike of the U.S. is partly rooted in their perception that America is an obstacle to their hopes of transforming their own societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By its example , America gives hope to both the organic traditionalist and the spontaneous modernizing elements in their own societies . And , of course , many Americans share the sentiments of those who would reject these American influences-which is why anti-Americanism has been a popular import in certain parts of the U.S. in recent years . <p> Self-blame and a taste for complexity go very comfortably together to form something I call " counter-tribalism . " This is a form of intellectual snobbery . A person in its grip has imbibed the notion that the patriotism of ordinary people is something simplistic , vulgar , and shameful , and thus to be avoided . He has been told that a genuinely sophisticated person-a university professor , say-has thrown off patriotic prejudice to become a citizen of the world . Now , of course , genuine cosmopolitanism is an admirable thing , drawing upon wide cultural sympathies but perfectly compatible with a simple love of country , as the work of any number of poets demonstrates . It is accordingly very rare . So what the counter-tribalist mistakes for cosmopolitanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marked prejudice that in any conflict the enemy of America is in the right . <p> Hence the extraordinary convolutions whereby feminists and multiculturalists find themselves taking the side of medieval Islamists against the common American enemy . They feel more comfortable in such superior company than alongside a hard-hat construction worker or a suburban golfer in plaid pants . But such preferences take some explaining . Hence not merely the taste for-but the absolute necessity of-complex explanations . <p> And all of this is in service of the notion of separating oneself from one 's fellow citizens who are not sophisticated enough to rise above simple loyalties . A wonderful example of such self-infatuation comes from Barbara Kingsolver , commenting on patriotism : <p> Patriotism threatens free speech with death . It is infuriated by thoughtful hesitation , constructive criticism of our leaders , and pleas for peace . It despises people of foreign birth who 've spent years learning our culture and contributing their talents to our economy In other words , the American flag stands for intimidation , censorship , violence , bigotry , sexism , homophobia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its obvious intellectual deficiencies , counter-tribalism has advanced considerably in recent years . Many of America 's troubles stem in part from the fact that it is the first nation with a dissident ruling class . Our elites in government , cultural institutions , the courts , the media , and even business have increasingly adopted the view that the American people are racist , sexist , and homophobic , and that it is therefore a prime duty of government to protect other people from them . In the current crisis , commentators have been predicting a vast national pogrom against American Muslims and have had desperately to exaggerate the relatively few ( if shameful ) incidents that have occurred to avoid disappointing their readers . In foreign policy , the first instinct of diplomatic elites when faced with a hostile attack is not to " overreact . " What makes the situation worse is that the elites have had some success in inculcating counter-tribalism into a large lumpenintelligentsia of teachers , librarians , researchers , small-town-newspaper " liberals , " clergymen , and assorted ancillary brainworkers . As journalist Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local teachers and clergymen were primarily concerned not to allow the reactions of the local people to degenerate into patriotic national sentiment . Twenty years of inculcating multiculturalist cliches into people has made the old expressions of patriotic sentiment seem taboo and even racist to some ears . <p> Will the terrorist attack change all this ? Will it provoke a cultural change in America that will make patriotism seem more natural to the elites ? Will it , indeed , mean that a different America will develop a wider and more inclusive patriotism , one more likely to defeat the multicultural platitudes in vogue until recently ? All these things are possible . But they will not happen by themselves . In particular , they will not happen without intellectual and moral effort on the part of people who know that patriotism is a virtue perfectly compatible with other virtues such as a genuine easygoing tolerance . Indeed , an American patriotism ( and , I would add , a British one ) would be among other things a celebration of tolerance . A first step in present circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the shallow , silly , self-regarding snobbery they undoubtedly are . <p> By John O'Sullivan <p>
