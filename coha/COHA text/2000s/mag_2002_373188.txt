American confidence is more than a state of mind ; it is a muscle , a westward-ho-ing , atom-splitting , moon-landing muscle , and Osama bin Laden 's autumn ambush , designed to break it , seemed only to make it stronger . The markets reopened within a week after Sept. 11 , swooned and then revived , and even as the fires still burned downtown and the soldiers headed off to war , more Americans said they believed the country was on the right track back in October than felt that way last week . Is it possible we could do to ourselves what our worst enemies did not manage ? <P> The corporate criminals among us , the swindlers and profiteers , are now described in language once saved for bin Laden 's legions . Business professors are staggered by the suicidal audacity of top executives  --  did they really think they would not be caught ?  --  and marvel at the damage done . " It 's as if we have given the CEOs weapons of mass destruction  --  at least economically , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The companies they run are bigger than ever . When something happens , thousands can lose their jobs  --  and more people than ever are invested in them . So a few can do a lot of damage . " <P> And that damage may be lasting . A new TIME/CNN poll finds that fewer than one-third of Americans expect the economy to improve in the next year . It is not just that we have confronted in WorldCom the worst case of fraud in U.S. corporate history ; today the bluest of chips , from Merck to General Electric , are being challenged about their bookkeeping . The perception of deception is so widespread , the stakes so high and the costs so great that investors are choosing to forfeit a game they now think is rigged . The markets skidded last week straight past their 9/11 lows into the most bearish forests in a generation . The dollar sank ever lower , and the Dow dropped through 9,000 toward a 7.4% loss for one week alone . Financial planners say many people wo n't open their 401(k) statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait in the dark , a new reality takes hold , that our lives this year are being reshaped by enemies both foreign and domestic , and while the public did unite behind its leaders in the face of the terrorist threat , we have less faith that they can protect us against the villains we planted and watered in our own backyards . <P> The President spent much of the week working to catch up to the country , to show that he felt its pain and shared its outrage . But when White House aides talked about his anger , they made it sound as if he were more steamed about the decision to end baseball 's All-Star game in the 11th inning . No matter how stern Bush looks when he declares that bad guys should go to jail , he has not erased charges that as an oilman in the ' 80s , he profited from the same kind of sweetheart deals he now decries . Public opinion is focused not on the Beltway but on the boardroom , and the President 's career , lineage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swivel chairs . " CEO , " an adviser warned the President , " has become a dirty word . "
