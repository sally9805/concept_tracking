Robert Loy sold more than a down stories to Alfred Hitchcock 's Mystery Magazine before trying to write an actual detective story . Perhaps you remember is-we published " Sing a Song of Sixpence " in our june 1999 issue . Now we 're happy to advertise the fact that J. B. Goode 's investigating services are needed once again ... <p> Advertising may be described as the science of arresting human intelligence long enough to get money from it . - Stephen Leacock I WAS GLAD WHEN THE mobile phone I had stuffed down my pants went off , and not just because I had it set on " vibrate " and I have n't had a date since the Johnson administration . I was getting tired of staking out this cottage , tired of tailing Big Red Riding Hood . I did n't care what her nosy old grandmother said . As far as I was concerned , it was Red 's picnic basket and she was old enough to share it with whoever she chose - even a woodcutter several years her senior . One thing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want my opinion , I think Granny had her big eyes on the guy . " Jack B. Goode . " I said into the mouthpiece , whispering because I did n't want to gum things up with Big Red . " Jack , hey , it 's Poppin ' . " " Hello , " I said kinda coolly . Poppin " Fresh was an old albino running buddy from back in my Navy days . He was quite a crusty old sea biscuit back then- he just laughed whenever anybody took a poke at him-but he got soft and puffy when he moved out to La-La Land to pitch Pillsbury . " How are ya ? " " Pretty good , " he answered in that annoying falsetto voice of his . Listening to him talk you 'd think butter would n't melt in his mouth , but I knew better . " I 've got a little yeast infection , but nothing major . " " Get yerself a girlfriend and that stuff 'll clear itself up . " Poppin " Fresh made plenty of dough as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff of life very often . In fact , he was one of the few people I knew whose love life was more pathetic than mine . At least I did n't lie about mine . Last time I talked to Poppin " he 'd told me some B.S. about how he 's a big studmuffin , got a Danish girl stashed away in a lovenest at the Parker House , and she might have a bun in the oven . " Jack , I 'm afraid I 've got some bad news . Something 's , uh , something 's come up . " A dog started yapping his head off somewhere in the background . " Hush , puppy ! " the doughboy shouted . " Anyway , it 's about Speedy . " " Speedy ? What about him ? " Even though I had n't seen Speedy in a coupla years , he was one of the few people on earth I considered a real friend . He was an elf who used to have a semi-respectable job as a shoemaker 's assistant . His work was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the law . Once I had to help him cobble together an alibi when he was charged with a Christmas Eve break-in . But we lost touch after he too headed for the Hollywood hills to become a shill . Things became strained between us when he took the job as a spokesman for Alka-Seltzer . But the last straw was when he had plastic surgery to make himself fatter , to look more like an antacid . That I just could n't stomach . " He 's dead , Jack . " " Whaddaya mean he 's dead ? " Sometimes Poppin 's sense of humor can charitably be described as wry . " I would n't kid about something like that , Jack . I 've got too much respect for you . As many times as you 've pulled my biscuits outta the fire - " " What happened ? " " Well , a bunch of us were at a little party at Aunt Jemima 's house . Speedy was there , and he was his usual happy-go-lucky self . You know , he always had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for the Jacuzzi to cool down a little . One of the Keebler elves was hitting on the hostess , and she shot him down , called him a no-good cracker . I tell you his ego was flatter than a - well , anyway , we were all laughing and having a good time , when all of a sudden Speedy fell off his chair , onto the floor then rolled into the boiling hot tub . It was plop , plop , then fizz , fizz . It was awful ; by the time we pulled him out there was no sign of life . " I 'm not a sentimental man , but I must admit I felt a burning sensation in my heart when I heard these words . Jeez , the last time I 'd seen the little guy I 'd called him a pill . Now he was gone . " Thanks for calling , Doughboy , I - " " You do n't understand , Jack . Speedy did n't die from the fall and he did n't drown . He was poisoned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speedy 's elf buddies , Crackle and Pop , are missing . So is Toucan Sam . I think there may be a serial killer on the loose . Jack , you got ta pop over here and help find the murderer , or I 'm afraid I might be the next victim . I 'm not the most popular guy in Hollywood , you know , and I do n't want to end up as toast . " So I left Big Red and her lumberjack boyfriend alone to kiss a little longer . The fat little ghost offered to lend me some bread , but I did n't want to be beholden to anybody . I wanted to catch whoever had killed Speedy on my own . Which meant I had to rely on my own lean pockets for travel funds . I hate riding the bus . It 's always chock full of nuts . And since this particular bus was headed out west to Hollyweird there were even more whackasaurases than usual on board . I sat in the back because I did n't really relish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greyhound jockeys . That did n't help much . I still ended up sitting next to some clown hearing voices in his head . Every few minutes he 'd turn and ask me if somebody had said some Scottish name-McDonald , I think it was . This kept ug until I told him I was hearing voices in my head too . They were telling me to put my cigarette out in his eye . A fishy-looking character in the seat in front of me turned and said , " Lotta stark raving loonies on the bus today . " He gave me a big , gaptoothed ... smile , I guess you 'd call it . " None of " em as stark raving as me , though . " " Sorry , Charlie , you 're not the starkest , look at that guy there , " I said , pointing to a huge , stuttering green man wearing a tunic of pea pods . He was seated with three women of questionable virtue , or as he called them , his " Ho-ho-ho " s . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat opened up near the front of the bus , away from these filberts and next to a hot-looking brunette . Does she or does n't she , I wondered , but I did n't have to wonder for long . Shortly after I sat down beside her , she asked me if I wanted to have sex for a hundred bucks . I almost said yes , figuring I could use the C-note as well as the exercise , but when I realized what she actually had in mind , I said , " No , thanks . " I have n't paid to play since I was a teenager ; as far as I 'm concerned tricks are for kids . Besides , it 's against my principles to pay for something that I hear some people , somewhere , are getting for free . JUST LIKE HE PROMISED , the doughboy sent somebody to pick me up at the bus station . I was hoping it would be somebody who had either information about Speedy or breasts . But it was some old duffer named W.C. Whipple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , made me privy to the fact that he was from Flushing . That 's all he said and he said that several times . If you ask me , I think the guy was a little potty . He dropped me off at Aunt Jemima 's house . And quite a nice house it was too . She 'd come a long way from that old log cabin in the north woods . The floor in her foyer was so shiny I thought at first she had buffed it with butter , but it turned out to be parquet . I 'd known Jemima for a long time . She and I used to hang out at the old Wish Bone club in Hidden Valley back in my salad days . So I did n't feel I had to wait on propriety or anything else . I walked straight over to her bar and poured myself a drink of whiskey - a big drink ; I needed to disinfect myself after the long bus ride . " Hungry , Jack ? " she asked . " Not now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol - if there is such a thing - off my lips with the back of my sleeve . " I came to see you cuz you 've got something I want . But that 'll have to wait , cuz right now I need to hear what you know about the murder that happened here under your roof . " " You 've come a long way , baby , " she said . " A long way for nothin ' . All I know " bout what happened to Speedy is that it must have been one sick puppy that would do something like that . I do n't usually like elves , but Speedy was a lot of fun , a real gas . " I poured myself another drink . " Yeah ? " I said , when I came up for air . " That ai n't the way Poppin " tells it . " " Hunk , well , I like his crust . What did that little glob of gluten say about me ? " " He said you and Speedy were romantic rivals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I checked my notes . " Elizabeth Crocker . " " Do n't give me any of your flap , jack , " she laughed . " The whole Crocker deal was ages ago . Betty wanted to have her cake and eat it too . I got me a new girlfriend now . " I had no trouble believing that . According to all the best tabloids , Jemima flitted from one romance to another , never making up her mind , always waffling . She was actually married to another spokesperson who had sown a lot of wild oats in his day as well . But he never kicked about her lesbian lovers cuz now he was a Quaker and did n't believe in divorce or many other modern conveniences . Some thought he was a sap but I thought he had grit . " Oh , yeah , that fishwife I read about . What 's her name again= Mrs. Paul " " Please , that relationship was crappy from the start . She 's got no ambition , always floundering around , carping about this and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that it 's any of your business , but let 's just say things have been getting pretty hot and sticky between me and Mrs. Butterworth . " I looked down at my notebook for I do n't know how long . I was n't thinking about my next question . I was wondering if maybe I should go gay like everybody else out here in Southern Commerciafornia . Hell , even that old fart Whipple had rushed off cuz he had a date with a yachtsman named Tyler D. Bowlman . But no , I decided I would have to forego the San Francisco treat . No way my battered ego could take being rejected by both genders . " You 're on the wrong track anyway , Jack , " Jemima said . " The person you 're looking for is wearing a badge of shame , not the Good Housekeeping Seal . " " What about Kool-Aid Mani " I asked . " I know he and Speedy had their share of dust-ups in the past . " " Ah , that guy took a powder a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Red Sox farm system , trying to make it as a pitcher . Well , Jack , sorry I could n't help you more . I 'm sure you 'll catch the killer , and when you do make sure he gets what 's coming to him . Do n't let him cop a plea . " She was looking at me funny , but whatever signals she was sending went right over my head . " Is it all right if I look at the Jacuzzi ? " I asked . " No , it is not all right . " A guy in a trench coat entered the room . He had a pug nose and an air of dogged determination . " In fact , you better just crawl right back into what ever hole you crawled out of , Jack . " Jemima turned to me and said , " Oh , I see you 've already met Officer McGruff . " " Yeah , I know the heel . " " I do n't know what your freaky friends are telling you , Goode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug overdose . Or did n't you know that Speedy was messing with amphetamines , cocaine , and just about anything else he could get his hands one " None of that came as a shock to me . I knew Speedy went through his problems when the public grew bored with elves and wanted something new to tell them where to throw their dough . He used to phone me all messed up , singing the praises of some substance he got from Bolivia or somesuch place , telling me , " Try it , you 'll like it . " Even strung out though , he was still the same generous elf he always was . That probably explained why the little guy never had any of the millions he 'd made as an antacid icon ; once he 'd discovered dope , the fool wanted to buy the world some coke . And despite all that , he was not self-destructive . He knew when to stop . He never ODed . " If you 're so sure it was his own fault , " I asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me looking at the hot tub ? " McGruff poached out his bottom lip and jutted out his boxer 's jaw . " You got a beef with the way the department 's handling this thing , do yaI It 's very simple . Little washed-up dope-addict Munchkin has-been takes a good hard look at his life and decides to cash in his chips . Sa where 's the beef ? This case is officially closed and the PD does not take kindly to people poking around closed cases . For your own good , just stay out of it , Jack . " I did n't stay out of it , of course , but I might as well have . I spent the rest of the afternoon following up on dead ends . I did manage to track down a couple of guys Speedy met on the unemployment line and used to hang with cuz they had some bad habits in common . Spuds McKenzie was in rehab . He would n't talk to me at all for a long time cuz he was sure I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hey , buddy , I 'll give you five hundred dollars for a cold one . " I gave him my ex-wife 's phone number . On the other hand , Joe Camel had completely turned his life around . No longer going by the street name Big C , he preferred to be called Brother Joseph : He had seen some kind of light , been born again as a Buddhist and was training to become a lama . I had to walk a mile or so to get to his cell , and when I got there he did n't have any ideas about who might have offed my friend . He did say that Speedy 's next life should be a good one cuz he was happier than he 'd ever been lately , off of the dope and looking forward to his new gig with some public service agency . I did n't have any ideas about who to talk to next , but Speedy was my friend , so I kept going and going . I burned up a lot of sole leather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at a bar , a real dive called the Vast Wasteland . I told myself a little dab 'd do me , but I ended up having several dabs and then washing those down with even more rye whiskey . I sorts remember talking to a guy named Mr. Coffee , who claimed to have been at Jemima 's party that night . But all he kept telling me was boring stories about how his wife , a popular gal named Sara Lee , had left him for some monoclewearing goober from Virginia named Mr. Peanut . I could easily see why ; the guy was a real drip . After that my memory gets blurry . I must have left the Wasteland and wandered into a transvestite club or something . The women were all tall and wore ruffly dresses , but a lot of those ruffles had ridges . I managed to find a straight bar where a woman named Elsie with huge udderlike breasts gave me some cheesy come-on about how she 'd take it off - take it all off - if I 'd just spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her to back off , that she was full of bull , when the cops burst in I guess it 's illegal to run a hetero club out here - and arrested several hot shots . I cut my arms and my chest squirming out of the bathroom window . I had n't done anything wrong , but raids really bug me . I WOKE UP FACE-DOWN between bloody sheets with a headache that had to register at least an 8.5 on the Richter Scale . For a while there I thought I might be dead and Lucifer was welcoming me to my new home by dancing a cloven-hoofed jig on my occipital bone . So I hunted around and found my heartbeat . I had taken a licking but it was still ticking . I lay still and tried to figure out how I felt about the prospect of continued breath and brain waves . The conclusion I eventually arrived at was : my life , I think I 'll keep it-at least until I find either Speedy 's killer or something that I can pass off as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for my clothes . This turned out to be a major tactical blunder , as the room decided it did n't like a perpendicular Jack and started swimming and jerking around , trying to throw me out the window . I crouched down on my hams , bare-assed and dizzy , to lower my center of gravity and plan my next move . None of the options I could see really set my heart aflutter , but breakfast at the diner next door sounded marginally more appealing than throwing up the majority of my intestines . So I carefully put on my clothes and headed that way . When I ordered coffee , the waitress asked if I wanted it black . I said I did n't care what color it was as long as it was hot and wet . She brought me a cup , and I poured half of it down my throat , then sweetened the rest with bourbon from my flask . Hair of the dog to go with my western omelet , which tasted a heck of a lot like dog food . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cook was letting his fingers do the walking- and all they wanted to do was hike up his nostrils . The answers to some questions I had shoved to the back burner all boiled over at the same time . Why was McGruff hanging around Jemima 's place if , as he said , the case was closed ? Surely it must occur to the ugly mutt that nobody wanted him around . And why did Jemima allow him to stay ? And what the hell was it that Brother Joseph had said about Speedy 's new gig ? Who was he going to be working for ? I jumped up , spilled coffee all over my pants , and pitched my last Lincoln at the waitress . I knew now without a doubt who had killed my friend Speedy . And if I could n't get across town in record time he was going to kill another friend of mine - if be had n't already . Cab drivers in Follywood must be brave creatures . One of them actually stopped for me-something I would never have done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told him to step on it , the first time I 've actually uttered that phrase . He was reluctant at first , until I flashed him a badge I 'd picked up in a dime store somewhere . " Police business , " I said . I guess he figured he could trust his car to a guy with a star , cuz he sure stepped on it then . We flew through - and around and over- the streets , the medians , the shoulders - even the sidewalks a couple times . I made up my mind that if I did go gay , this was the guy I was going to marry . " That 's as fast as she 'll go , " he yelled over his shoulder . Then he shook his head and punched the steering wheel . " Damn , I coulda had a V-8 . " We pulled up in Jemima 's driveway and I leapt out of the cab , just as the aptly nicknamed Crime Dog kicked open the front door and came out leading a gagged , handcuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McGruff , " I yelled , my .38 jumping into my hand . He whipped out a big shiny black automatic with a barrel so long it made me feel positively pre-pubescent . He pointed it at jemima 's right temple . " Jack , you really screwed up this time , " he growled . " This could have been so simple . Adulterous wife disappears and is never heard from again . Everybody assumes she 's run off with some new girlfriend . No questions , no problems . Now you 're going to have to join her at the bottom of a short stack of bodies . " " I 've got a better plan , " I told McGruff , wishing to God I 'd paid attention back in that geometry class my mini-skirted high-school guidance counselor almost convinced me to take . I could n't find an angle that would give me a clear shot at the mangy son of a bitch . " You drop the gun and give yourself up . Tell the judge you went temporarily insane when the crime prevention people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be out in fifteen years . " I did n't see any reason to point out that would be 105 years the way he calculated time . McGruff laughed . Mirthlessly , as they say . Pushing and dragging Jemima down the stairs , he said , " You may have stumbled onto the right answer this once , Goode . But that does n't mean I ca n't still catch the gravy train . I 'm a whole hell of a lot quicker than you are . I can blow both of you guys 's heads off before those rummy old hands of yours stop shaking long enough for you to find the trigger . Now you drop your gun and she wo n't get hurt . " His eyes were hard but his tail was wagging . This might be a pissing contest , but I could n't take the chance . I dropped my gun . " That was the smartest move you ever made , " McGruff said . " Unfortunately , it 's going to be your last . " Holding Jemima by the neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a real hero would come up with some brilliant last minute plan and save the day . All I could think to do was clench my butt muscles and hope that Heaven had a smoking section . A shot rang out . The loudest shot I have ever heard . I knew my ears were gone , but I ducked down and grabbed my head to make sure the rest of it was still on . I was gratified to discover that it was not me who 'd been shot . And it was n't Jemima either . McGruff 's right front haunch was bleeding . It was n't a fatal wound , but he would n't be catching any Frisbees for a while . I ran over and picked McGruff 's weapon up off the ground and slapped a pair of his own cuffs on his paws . Then I turned just in time to see the cab driver holstering his pistol . This guy had saved my life . Now I really felt bad about not having the money to pay his fare . " Where did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at me like I was crazy . " In Southern California you have to take a class in marksmanship before they give you your hack license . " I had momentarily forgotten about Jemima . She ran up to me and hopped around so I could untie her . I did so and she ripped the gag out of her mouth , then turned to face me . I held up my hand to tell her there was no reason to go on and on thanking me . Just knowing she was all right was all the thanks I needed . Well , that and the chance to make myself a sandwich the next time she and Mrs. Butterworth got " Jack ! " she shrieked , sounding a whole lot more irate than appreciative . " What the hell is wrong with you ? Where have you been ? I ca n't believe even you would go out playboying around all over town when you knew that a killer was after me ? ! " " But , I did n't - " " You knew I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted to kill me . You were my only hope . And do n't tell me you did n't know the score . Jeez , I practically spelled the whole thing out for you yesterday . All those hints - those big , broad hints I was risking my life to drop on you . " " What hints ? I did n't pick up on any - " Jemima shook her head in disgust . " Oh , you did n't ? Do n't you remember me telling you it was a sick puppy " that did this to Speedy ? That he was wearing a " badge of shame ' ? Remember ? I told you do n't let the killer " cop " a plea . " " Yeah , so ? " I could n't get what she was driving at - except the part about me not getting any loving for saving her life . That part was coming in loud and clear . " So ? Puppy , badge , cop - what does that all add up to , Jack ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not real big on wordplay . "
