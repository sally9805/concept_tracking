The man behind the cluttered desk looked like the devil , and Nell Dysart figured that was par for her course since she 'd been going to hell for a year and a half anyway . Meeting Gabriel McKenna just meant she 'd arrived . " Yes , I think you better to look into that , " he said into the phone with barely disguised impatience , his sharp eyes telegraphing his annoyance . It was rude to talk on the phone in front of her , but he did n't have a secretary to answer the phone for him , and she was a job applicant not a client , and he was a detective not an insurance salesman , so maybe the regular rules of social intercourse did n't apply . " I 'll come up on Monday , " he said . " No , Trevor , waiting would not be better . I 'll talk to all of you at eleven . " He sounded as if he were talking to a fractious uncle , not a client . The detective business must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could dictate to clients like that , especially clients named Trevor . The only Trevor Nell knew was her sister-in-law 's father , and he was richer than God , so maybe Gabe McKenna was really powerful and successful and just needed somebody to manage his office back into shape . She could do that . Nell looked around the shabby room and tried to be positive , but the place was gloomy in the September afternoon light , even gloomier because the ancient blinds on the equally ancient big windows were pulled down . The McKenna Building stood on the corner of two of the city 's prettier thoroughfares in German Village , a district wherepeoplepaid big bucks to look out their windows at historic Ohio brick streets and architecture , but Gabriel McKenna pulled his blinds , probably so he could n't see the mess inside . The walls were covered with dusty framed black and white photos , the furniture needed to be cleaned and waxed , and his desk needed to be plowed . She 'd never seen so much garbage on one surface in her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , his voice low and sure . The light from his green-shaded desk lamp threw shadows on his face , but with those dark eyes closed now , he did n't look nearly as satanic . More like your average , dark-haired , fortysomething businessman in a striped shirt and loosened tie . Like Tim . Nell stood up abruptly and dropped her purse on the chair . She went to the big window to open the blinds and let in a little light . If she cleaned the place up , he could leave the blinds open to make a better impression . Clients liked doing business in the light , not in the pit of hell . She tugged once on the cord and it stuck , so she tugged again , harder , and this time it came off in her hand . Oh , great . She looked back , but he was still on the phone , his broad shoulders hunched , so she shoved the cord onto the windowsill . It fell off onto the hardwood floor , the plastic end making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned into the blind-covered window to get it from behind the chair that was in the way . It was just out of her finger 's reach , another damn thing out of her reach , so she pressed harder against the blinds , stretching to touch it with her fingertips . The window cracked under her shoulder . " I 'll see you on Monday , " he said into the phone , and she kicked the cord behind the radiator and went back to sit down before he could notice that she was destroying his office around him . Now she had to get the job so she could cover the tracks of her vandalism . And besides , there was that desk ; somebody needed to save this guy . And then there was her need for money to pay for rent and other luxuries . Somebody needs to save me , she thought . He hung up the phone and turned to her , looking tired . " I apologize , Mrs. Dysart . You can see how much we need a secretary . " Nell looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secretary , buddy , but she said , " Perfectly all right . " She was going to be cheerful and helpful if it killed her . He picked up her rsum . " Why did you leave your last position ? " " My boss divorced me . " " That would be a reason , " he said , and began to read . His people skills needed work , she thought as she stared down at her sensible black pumps , planted firmly on the ancient Oriental rug where they could n't walk her into trouble again . Now if he 'd been Tim , he 'd have offered her sympathy , a Kleenex , a shoulder to cry on . He would have followed that up by suggesting the purchase of some insurance , but he would have been sympathetic . There was a spot on the carpet , and she rubbed at it with the toe of her shoe , trying to blend it in . Spots made a place look unsuccessful ; it was the details that counted in an office environment . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot got bigger ; it was n't a spot , she 'd found a hole and had managed to shred it to double its size in under fifteen seconds . She put her foot over the hole and thought , Take me , Jesus , take me now . " Why do you want to work for us ? " he said , and she smiled at him , trying to look bright and eager , plus the aforementioned cheerful and helpful , which was hard since she was middle-aged and cranky . " I think it would be interesting to work for a detective agency . " I think I need a job so I can hold onto my divorce settlement for my old age . " You 'd be amazed how boring it is , " he said . " You 'll be doing mostly typing and filing and answering phones . You 're overqualified for this job . " I 'm also forty-two and unemployed , she thought , but she said brightly , " I 'm ready for a change . " He nodded , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she wondered if he was enough like Tim that he 'd recycle her in twenty years , if after the passage of time he would look at her and say , " We 've grown apart . I swear I have n't been interviewing other secretaries on the side , but now I need somebody new . Somebody with real typing skills . Somebody " The arm of the chair wobbled under her hand , and she realized she 'd been pulling up on it . Relax . She shoved it back down again , clamping her elbow to her side to stop the chair arm from moving any more , keeping her foot on the spot on the rug . Just sit still , she told herself . Behind her , the blind rustled as it slipped a little . " You certainly have the skills we need , " McKenna said , and she forced a smile . " However , our work here is highly confidential . We have a rule : We never talk about business outside this office . Can you be discreet ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair arm as she tried to radiate discretion . " You do understand that this is a temporary position ? " " Uh , yes , " Nell lied , feeling suddenly colder . Here was her new life , just like her old life . She heard a faint crack from the direction of the chair arm and loosened her grip a little . " Our receptionist is recovering from an accident and should be back in six weeks , " he was saying . " So October thirteenth " " I 'm history , " Nell finished . At least he was letting her know ahead of time that the end was coming . She would n't get attached . She would n't have a son with him . She would n't The chair arm wobbled again , much looser this time , and he nodded . " If you want the Job , it 's yours . " The blind slipped again , a rusty , sliding sound . " I want the job , " Nell said . He fished in his center desk drawer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the outer office on the days my partner , Riley , or I have n't opened before you get here . " He stood and offered her his hand . " Welcome to McKenna Investigations , Mrs. Dysart . We 'll see you Monday at nine . " Nell stood , too , releasing the chair arm gingerly in the hope that it would n't fall to the floor . She reached for his hand , sticking hers out forcefully to show confidence and strength , and hit one of the Styrofoam cups . Coffee spread over his papers while they both watched , their hands clasped over the carnage . " My fault , " he said , letting go of her to grab the cup . " I never remember to throw these out . " " Well , that 's my job for the next six weeks , " she said , perky as all hell . " Thank you so much , Mr. McKenna . " She gave him one last insanely positive smile and left the office before anything else could happen . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her was the blind slipping once , bouncing , and then crashing down , exposing the star-cracked window , brilliant in the late afternoon light . When Eleanor Dysart was gone , Gabe looked at the broken window and sighed . He found a bottle of Bayer in his middle drawer and took two of the aspirin , washing them down with hours-old coffee that had been awful when it was hot , grimacing as somebody knocked on his office door . His cousin Riley loomed blondly in the doorway , doing his usual impression of a half-bright halfback . " Who was the skinny redhead who just left ? Cute , but if we take her case , we should feed her . " " Eleanor Dysart , " Gabe said . " She 's filling in for Lynnie . And she 's stronger than she looks . " Riley frowned at the window as he sat down in the chair Eleanor Dysart had just vacated . " When 'd the window get broken ? " " About five minutes ago . And we 're hiring her , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because Jack Dysart asked us to . " Riley looked disgusted . " One of his ex-wives we do n't know about ? " He leaned on the chair arm , and it cracked and broke so that he had to catch himself to keep from falling through it . " What the hell ? " " Sister-in-law , " Gabe said , staring sadly at the chair . " Divorced from his brother . " " Those Dysart boys are hell on wives , " Riley said , picking up the chair arm from the floor . " I mentioned to Jack that we needed a temp and he sent her over . Be nice to her . Other people have n't been . " Gabe stashed his aspirin back in the drawer and picked up a coffee-soaked paper . He used another paper to blot the coffee off and held it out to Riley . " You 've got the Hot Lunch on Monday . " Riley gave up on the chair arm and dropped it on the floor to take the paper . " I hate chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirin . " If relationship investigation bothers you , you might want to rethink your career choice . " " It 's the people , not the job . Like Jack Dysart . A lawyer who thinks adultery is a hobby , there 's the bottom of the food chain for you . What a loser . " That 's not why you hate him , Gabe thought , but it was late on Friday afternoon , and he had no interest in pursuing his cousin 's old grudges . " I have to see him and Trevor Ogilvie on Monday . Both senior partners at once . " " Good for you . I hope Jack 's in trouble up to his neck . " " They 're being blackmailed . " " Blackmail ? " Riley said , his voice full of disbelief . " Jack ? There 's stuff out there that 's even worse than the stuff everybody knows about him ? " " Possibly , " Gabe said , thinking about Jack and his total disregard for the consequences of his actions . It was amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get away with . At least , it was amazing what Jack got away with . " Jack thinks it 's just a disgruntled employee trying to scare them . Trevor thinks it 's a prank and if they wait a few weeks " Riley snorted . " There 's Trevor for you . A lawyer who 's made a fortune delaying the other side to death . Which is still better than Jack , the devious son of a bitch . " Gabe felt a spurt of irritation . " Oh , hell , Riley , give the man some credit , it 's been fourteen years and he 's still married to her . She cracked thirty a while back and he stuck . He may even be faithful for all we know . " Riley scowled at him . " I have no idea what you 're talking about " " Susannah Campbell Dysart , the defining moment of your youth . " " but if my choice is between the Hot Lunch and Jack Dysart , " Riley went on , " I 'll take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ; it 'll be on my way . " Gabe frowned at him . " I thought you were working a background check on Monday . What are you doing on campus ? " " Having lunch , " Riley said , looking innocent . Gabe 's irritation grew . Riley was thirty-four . Maturity was long overdue . " You 're dating a grad student now ? " " Junior , " Riley said , without guilt . " Horticulture major . Knows everything about plants . Did you realize that the coneflower " " So she 's what , fifteen years younger than you are ? " " Thirteen , " Riley said . " I 'm broadening my horizons by learning about the plant world . You , on the other hand , are in such a deep rut you ca n't even see your horizons . Come out with us , get hooked up " " With an undergraduate . " Gabe shook his head , disgusted . " No . I 'm calling Chloe for dinner tonight . I will be hooked up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I like Chloe , sleeping with your ex-wife is not going to get you out of your rut . " " Much as sleeping with a college junior will not help you achieve adulthood , " Gabe said . " Fine , be that way . " Riley stood up , affable as ever . " Give my best to Jack and the boys on Monday . " He picked up the broken chair and switched it with the one by the window and then left , and Gabe began to sort through the rest of the splattered papers on his desk . As an afterthought , he picked up the phone and hit the speed dial for The Star-Struck Cup , his ex-wife 's teashop . He could have walked through the door that connected the agency reception room to The Cup 's storeroom and talked to his ex in the flesh , but he did n't want Chloe in the flesh at that moment , he just wanted to make sure he had access to her flesh later . When Chloe answered , her voice bubbling over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good , " she said , some of the bubble gone . " Listen , a woman was just in here buying almond cookies . Tall and thin . Faded red hair . Pretty eyes . Did she come from you ? " " Yes , but she 's not a client so you can skip the pep talk about how I have to save her . She 's Lynnie 's temp replacement . " " She has an interesting look to her , " Chloe said . " I bet she 's a Virgo . Give me her birth date . " " No . Dinner at eight ? " " Yes , please . We need to talk . Lu thinks maybe she 'd rather backpack through Europe this fall . " " Not a chance . I paid her first-quarter tuition . " " This is your daughter 's life , Gabe . " " No . She 's only eighteen . That 's too young for Europe by herself . " " She 's the same age I was when I married you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you made . " Chloe , she 's going to college . If she hates it after the first quarter , we 'll talk . " Chloe sighed . " All right . Now about this Virgo " " No , " Gabe said and hung up , thinking about his lovely blonde daughter making plans to backpack through faraway countries filled with predatory men while his lovely blonde ex-wife consulted the same stars that had told her to divorce him . He reached for the aspirin again and this time he washed it down with the Glenlivet he kept stashed in his bottom drawer , just as his dad had before him . He was going to have to do something about Chloe and Lu , not to mention Jack Dysart and Trevor Ogilvie and whatever mess they 'd gotten themselves and their law firm into this time . The only cheerful thing in his future was that he 'd be sleeping with Chloe later . That was always nice . Nice ? He stopped . Christ , what had happened to " hot " ? It could n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . So it 's me , he thought , looking at the scotch bottle in one hand and the aspirin bottle on the desk . I 'm played out , relying on booze and drugs to get me through the day . Of course , it was Glenlivet and Bayer he was abusing , not Ripple and crack . His eye fell on the photograph on the wall across from him : his dad and Trevor Ogilvie , forty years before , hands clasped on each other 's pinstriped shoulders , grinning at the camera , which they toasted with glasses of scotch . A fine old tradition , he thought and remembered his dad saying , " Trevor 's a great guy , but without me , he 'd ignore his problems until they blew up in his face . " You left me more than half the agency , Pop . Not cheered by this , Gabe stashed both bottles in the desk and began to sort through the mess on his desk to find his notes . Damn good thing they had a secretary coming in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his life easier , the way Chloe had when she 'd been his secretary . He shot an uneasy glance at the broken window . He was pretty sure Eleanor Dysart was going to make his life easier . And if she did n't , he 'd just fire her , even if she was the ex-sister-in-law of their biggest client . If there was one thing he did n't need in his life , it was more people making him crazy . He was full up on those already . On the other side of the village park , Nell sat at her large dining room table in her very small apartment and said , " And then as I left , the blind fell down with this huge crash and there was the broken window . " She watched straight-faced as her sister-in-law Suze Dysart hiccuped with laughter , platinum beautiful even while gasping . " Maybe he 'll think it was somebody outside who broke it , " Nell 's other sister-in-law , Margie , said from beside her , her plain little face as hopeful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . " If you never tell him , maybe he 'll never know . " She took a small silver thermos out of her bag as she spoke and topped up her cup with the soy milk she carried with her . " He 's a detective , " Nell said . " I hope to God he knows , or I 'm working for Elmer Fudd . " " Oh , God , it 's been too long since I laughed like that . " Suze took a deep breath . " What are you going to do about the rug ? " " Maybe you can stick the holey part under his desk . " Margie reached for an almond cookie . " If he never sees it , maybe he 'll never know . " She bit into the cookie and said , " I love these , but the woman who makes them is very stingy with the recipe . " " If you could make the cookies , would you buy them from her ? " Suze said , and when Margie shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . " She turned back to Nell and pushed the cookie plate toward her . " Eat and tell us about it . What 's the place like ? What 's your new boss like ? " " He 's a slob , " Nell said . " It 's going to take me the entire six weeks just to clean off his desk . " That was a good thought , organizing somebody 's life , getting back in charge of things . Time to get moving again , she thought and sat still . " Ouch . " Margie looked under the table . " What did I just kick ? Why are there boxes under here ? " " My china , " Nell said . " You have n't unpacked your china yet ? " Margie sounded scandalized . " She 'll get to it . " Suze sent an unmistakable shut-up glare Margie 's way . Margie , of course , missed it . " If she had her china out , she could look at it , and it would make her feel more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Suze said , still staring at her with intent . " Mine 's out and it makes me want to throw up , although that may be because I 'm stuck with the butt-ugly Dysart Spode . " " I love looking at my dishes , " Margie said sadly over her coffee , which was not news to the rest of the table . Margie had more Franciscan Desert Rose earthenware than any other woman on the planet . Suze finally caught Margie 's eye , and Margie straightened , smiling . Nell wanted to say , " Look , guys , it 's all right , " but then she 'd just have to cope with both of them reassuring her again . " Well , I think it 's wonderful , " Margie said , faux chipper . " This new job and all . You 've always liked working . " She sounded slightly bemused by that , as if it were a mystery to her . " I did n't like working , " Nell said . " I liked running my own business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We built it together . " " Then why does he have it now ? " Margie said , and Nell wished Suze would glare at Margie again . " Well , I 'd like working , " Suze rushed in . " I do n't know what I want to do , but after fourteen years of college , I must be qualified to do something . " Then get a Job , Nell thought , impatient at hearing Suze 's lament again , and then felt guilty . Suze talked about work and did n't do anything about it , but Nell had n't done anything , either , until Jack had called about the McKennas . Margie was still obsessing about Tim . " Tell me you at least got half of those ugly glass awards he was so proud of . " Nell kept her temper . Snarling at Margie was like kicking a puppy . " The Icicles ? No . I left them with the agency . It would n't have been fair " " Do n't you ever get tired of being fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " she said . " And as for the new job , all I 'm going to do is answer phones and type of six weeks . I'ts not a career . It 's like practice , just to get me started again . " " It 's a detective agency , " Suze said . " I thought that would be exciting . Sam Spade and Effie Perine . " She sounded wistful . " Who ? " Margie said . " A famous detective and his secretary , " Suze said . " I studied them in my film noir course . I thought Sam and Effie had the best jobs . The clothes were good , too . " She pushed the plate toward Nell . " Have a cookie . " Margie refocused on Nell . " Is your boss cute ? " " No . " Nell stirred her coffee and thought about Gabe McKenna . It was his eyes that had made her nervous , she decided . That and the sheer weight of his presence , the threat of potential temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's tall and solid-looking , and he frowns a lot , and his eyes are dark so it 's hard to read him . He looks ... I do n't know . An- noyed . Sarcastic . " She remembered him sitting behind his desk , ignoring her . " Actually , he looks like Tim . " " That does n't sound like Tim , " Margie said . " Tim 's always smiling and saying nice things . " " Tim 's always trying to sell insurance , " Suze said . " But you 're right , that does n't sound like Tim . Do n't get them confused . Tim is a loser . The new guy might be good . Anybody but Tim might be good . " Nell sighed . " Look , he was very polite , but that was it . " " Maybe he was fighting his attraction to you , " Suze said . " Maybe he was distant because he did n't want to come on too strong but his heart beat faster when he saw you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Nell is n't the type to drive men crazy on first sight . Men do that for you because you 're young and beautiful , so you think it 's that way for everybody . " " I 'm not that young , " Suze said . " He was not attracted to me , " Nell said firmly . " This is a job only . " " All right , " Margie said . " But you do have to start dating now . You should be married again . " Yeah , because that worked out so well the last time . " She 's right , " Suze said . " You do n't want to be alone . " She said it as if it were a fate worse than death . " Although maybe not , " Margie said , staring off into space . " Come to think of it , it 's the men who always want to get married . Look at Tim , marrying Whitney so soon . " Ouch , Nell thought and saw Suze swing toward Margie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait , he 's driving me crazy about setting a date . " Margie bit into her cookie and chewed , deep in thought . " You know , he moved in a month after Stewart left , so I never had much of a chance to look around . There might be somebody better . " Nell was so surprised she almost dropped her coffee cup . Suze put hers down in her saucer with a loud clink . " Marjorie Ogilvie Dysart , I am astonished at you . That man 's lived with you for seven years and vou 're thinking about leaving him ? " " Well , " Margie began . " Go for it , " Suze said . " Do n't think twice . If you need help moving , I 'm there . " " Or maybe I 'll get a job , " Margie went on . " If you like your job , Nell , maybe I 'll get one . Not at the agency , though . Budge says the McKennas deal with too many low people . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Budge looked like the Sta- Puf Marshmallow Man and talked like a Moral Majority leader . " I 'm amazed Budge lets you hang out with me , then . " Margie blinked at her . " You 're not low . You 're just depressed . " Suze shoved the cookie plate toward her to distract her . " Nell is not depressed . And speaking of Budge , if you 're going to stay with him , would you please tell him again not to call me Suzie . ' I 've reminded him over and over and he still does it . One more time and I swear to God , I 'm going to break his glasses . " " I just wonder sometimes , " Margie said , not paying attention . " You know . Is this all there is ? " Nell nodded . " I used to wonder , too . Sometimes I 'd look around the insurance agencv and think , This is the rest of my life ? ' Then it turned out it was n't . Trust me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't push your luck , " Suze said . " You married the wrong guy . " " No , I did n't , " Nell said . " He was the right guy for twenty-two years . " She stared into her coffee cup . " It 's not like he cheated " " Oh , for heaven 's sake , " Suze said . " If I hear one more time about how it 's not Tim 's fault because he did n't cheat before he left you , I 'm going to throw something . He left you alone and hurt you so much you do n't even eat anymore . " She stared at the coolie plate , visibly upset . " He 's scum . I hate him . Find somebodv new and start a new life . " I liked my old life . Nell took a deep breath . " Look , can we wait to see if I survive working for Gabriel McKenna for six weeks before I deal with other men ? " " Okay , six weeks , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you eat now . " " I think we should unpack your china , " Margie said . God , preserve me from those who love me , Nell thought and drank the rest of her coffee . Five hours later , in his third-floor apartment above the agency , Gabe would have thought much the same thing if he 'd been thinking at all . After the day he 'd had , all he 'd wanted was sex and silence , and now he was halfway there , making only a vague pretense of listening to Chloe in bed beside him . " I liked the way she looked . " Chloe was saying . " And I checked her birth date on the application , and she is a Virgo , just like I thought . She 's going to be an excellent secretary . " " Hmmmm . " " So I think you should fire Lynnie and make this Eleanor permanent , " Chloe said , her usual delicately suggestive voice blunt , and Gabe woke up a little . " Even before I knew Lynnie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know she 's efficient , but she does n't take care of anybody but herself . That dark hair . Eleanor will be perfect for you . " Gabe ignored the dark hair bittracking down Chloe 's free associations could take hoursto concentrate on the important point . " Chloe , I do n't tell you how to run your business , so butt out of mine . " Another thought intruded . " How did you see that application ? " " It was on your desk . I looked after you left . She has a Cancer moon . " " If that means she has a nice ass , you 're right . Stay out of my office . " Gabe rolled away in the forlorn hope she 'd shut up . " I bet she was a real redhead once , " Chloe said . " There was fire there , I 'd bet anything . But she 's all faded out now . " She nudged him with her elbow . " You could do something about that , put some of the fire back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone , " Gabe said into his pillow . " Unless AT &T; inflames her , she 's out of luck . " Chloe sat up and leaned over his shoulder , and he closed his eyes in pleasure at all that warm softness pressed against his back . Then she said , " Gabe , I do n't think we should see each other anymore . " Gabe turned his head to look up at her . The moon came through the skylight and backlit Chloe 's short blonde curls , making her look angelically lovely . Too bad she was insane . " You live next door . You work in the same building I do . You sleep with me several times a week . What 's your plan , blindfolds ? " " I 'm serious , Gabe . I think it 's time we broke up . " Gabe turned his back on her again . " We did that already . It was a success . Go to sleep . " " You never listen , " Chloe said , and Gabe could feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are you going ? " he said to her , exasperated , as she struggled into her clothes . " Home , " Chloe said , and since that was just next door , Gabe said , " Fine . See you tomorrow . " " Gabe , " Chloe said a minute later , and Gabe rolled over to see her standing at the foot of his bed , braless in her moons-and-stars T-shirt , her hands on her hips like a particularly demanding child . When she did n't say anything , he propped himself up on his elbows and said with exaggerated patience , " What ? " Chloe nodded . " Good , you 're awake . You and I have stayed together partly because of Lu but mostly because there was n't anybody else we liked better . You 're a very nice man , but we 're not right for each other , and we owe it to ourselves to find our soul mates . " " I love you , " Gabe said . " If you were n't such a fucking whacko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love you , too , but this is not the great love we both deserve . And someday you 're going to look at me and say , Chloe , you were right . ' " " I 'll say it now if you 'll shut up and come back to bed . " " I think this Eleanor could be the one for you . I spent two hours on her horoscope , and I ca n't tell for sure without getting her time of birth for her rising sign , but I really think she might be your match . " Gabe felt suddenly cold . " Tell me you did n't tell her that . " " Well , of course not . " Chloe sounded exasperated . " Look , I know how you hate change , so I 'm setting us both free so you can start over with Eleanor and I can find the man I was meant to be with . " Gabe sat up straighter . " You 're not serious about this . " " Very , " Chloe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll always love you . " " Wait a minute . " Gabe rolled toward the foot of the bed to reach for her , but she faded away into the dark , and a moment later he heard the door to his apartment close with a finality that was rare for Chloe . Ninety-nine times out of a hundred , Chloe did exactly what he told her to do . This was clearly the hundredth . He fell back into bed and stared up at the skylight , depressed by the realization that his ex-wife had just dumped him again . A shooting star traced its way above the skylight , and he watched it fade . Were n't those supposed to be good luck ? Chloe would know , but she 'd walked out . His future now consisted of an endless string of days spent coping with clients like Jack Dysart , keeping his daughter in college , chasing down a series of cheating mates , and watching his temp secretary destroy his office , all as a celibate . " I want my old life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pillow over his head to block out the stars that were responsible for his latest disaster .
