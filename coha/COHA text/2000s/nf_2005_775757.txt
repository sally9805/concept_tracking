What Is Diabetes ? // Anytime you want to learn about a medical problem , it 's best to approach it in two steps . First , learn how the body functions normally . Then focus on what happens when something goes wrong . This is the best way to learn about diabetes , too . First , you need to understand how the body normally produces energy . You should then focus on how a breakdown in this process leads to the two major types of diabetes  --  either your body ca n't make any or enough insulin , or it ca n't properly use the insulin it produces . // How the Body Normally Produces Energy // Quite simply , you ca n't live without food . The body needs food to nourish itself and sustain life . Food is both " fuel " and " building material . " It produces energy , builds and repairs body tissue , and regulates body functions . But before food is used by the cells , it 's put through some biological paces . First , your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients , or nutrients : These nutrients fall into three major categories  --  carbohydrates , proteins , and fats . // Carbohydrates are found in most foods . Often called " starches " and " sugars , " they are found in bread , pasta , fruits , and vegetables . Proteins are found in meats , milk , and fish . Fats are found in such foods as vegetable oils , meat , cheese , and other dairy products . All these nutrients are digested , or broken down , in the stomach and intestines . Carbohydrates are broken down into a simple sugar called glucose , which passes through the wall of the intestines into your bloodstream . This is the form of sugar that is often called " blood glucose " or , more simply , just " blood sugar . " Diabetes is a disorder in the way the body uses blood sugar , or glucose . // The Role of Insulin // Once glucose gets into your bloodstream , it circulates to the body 's cells to provide them energy . But glucose ca n't simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin wall called a membrane , and something has to tell your cells that glucose is waiting outside . That something is insulin . It attaches on the outside of the cells to special sites called insulin receptors  --  much like a key that fits into a lock . Insulin is the " key " that unlocks the cells , allowing glucose to enter . Once inside , the glucose is metabolized , or " burned , " by the cells for energy . // Exactly what kind of substance is insulin ? It is a hormone  --  a chemical messenger made in one part of the body to transmit " information " through your bloodstream to cells in another part of the body . Your body produces many types of hormones . Insulin is a specific kind of hormone made in the organ called the pancreas . // The Pancreas // The pancreas is a small gland situated below and behind the stomach . In an adult , it weighs less than half a pound . The pancreas is shaped like a long cone lying on its side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Within this tail are tiny bits of tissue called islets of Langerhans. // A normal pancreas has about 100,000 islets of Langerhans . But these islets are actually clusters of various types of cells . The most important are the beta cells  --  the tiny " factories " that make insulin . The beta cells also serve as " warehouses , " storing insulin until it 's needed by the body . // In addition to producing insulin , the pancreas has other important duties . Some cells produce hormones that are quite different from insulin , such as glucagon . This hormone actually raises the blood sugar  --  just the opposite function of insulin . The balancing act between insulin and glucagon helps keep blood sugar in the normal range , approximately 60-140 milligrams ( mg ) of sugar per deciliter ( dl ) of blood . Other cells in the pancreas produce substances called enzymes , which help in digestion by splitting foodstuffs into simpler substances , which can then be absorbed through the intestine into the bloodstream. // How Insulin Works // During normal digestion , enzymes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbohydrates , proteins , and fats ) , splitting them into simple substances , which enter the bloodstream in the following forms : // * Carbohydrates are converted into glucose , which is metabolized , or " burned , " for energy . // * Proteins are converted into amino acids , which provide the basic building blocks for bone , muscle , and other tissues . Proteins also can be burned for energy . // * Fats become fatty acids , which are burned for energy or stored as body fat for later use . However , fat is burned differently from glucose , producing substances called ketones. // Insulin plays a role in the burning and storage of all these nutrients . In diabetes , however , its main role relates to the action of glucose , the simplified form of carbohydrates . The whole process works like a dietary drama . The key actors are the beta cells , which make and store insulin . When they sense the level of glucose rising in the blood , they respond by releasing just the right amount of insulin into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insulin held in storage . But what if the body needs even more ? This often happens right after a meal , and as the blood glucose levels increase , a second stage begins . The " control centers " of the beta cells trigger them to make more insulin . When functioning normally , the beta cells release just enough insulin to maintain the level of glucose in the blood within the normal range of 60-140 mg/dl , and once in the bloodstream , the insulin enables the glucose to enter your body 's cells for energy . // Another process also occurs . Generally when you eat , you do n't need to use all the glucose from your food immediately . The body takes some of the glucose and stores it for future needs . With insulin 's help , the extra glucose is taken up by the liver cells and changed to a storage form called glycogen . Glycogen comes in handy when your body needs extra energy in a hurry , for instance , during exercise . At those times , your body rises to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glucose . In addition , this stored glucose takes care of your energy needs overnight , a time when you normally are n't eating . Insulin also helps convert some of the extra glucose into fat , which is stored in the body 's fat cells . // What Goes Wrong in Diabetes ? // Diabetes is caused by a breakdown in the normal processes described above . A breakdown can occur in one of two ways : ( 1 ) the body produces little or no insulin ; or ( 2 ) the insulin that the body produces ca n't link up with the body 's cells . Type I diabetes is the result of the first defect ; Type II is the result of the second . It is important to note , however , that there are many similarities between Type I and Type II diabetes , and that some people display characteristics of both types . // Type I : Insulin-Dependent Diabetes // Of all people with diabetes , about 5-10 percent have Type I , which develops most often in children and young adults . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , this type of diabetes can occur in people of any age . // The Problem . Type I diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces very little , if any , insulin . In short , the beta cells do not function . People with this type of diabetes are insulin-dependent . They must have daily doses of insulin from an outside source to function and survive . Insulin must be provided by injection with a syringe ( " a shot " ) . It can not be taken by mouth because the stomach acids make insulin ineffective . // The Symptoms . By understanding what happens when the body lacks insulin , you can understand the various symptoms of diabetes  --  the outward signs that something is wrong . // * Lack of energy . This symptom occurs because your body has no insulin to enable your cells to change blood sugar into energy . Without energy , you feel tired . // * Constant hunger . When you are unable to get energy from the sugar in your blood , your body sends out hunger signals for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't the real problem . The problem is that your body ca n't use the sugar already there . // * Weight loss . This symptom often occurs because the body , unable to use sugar in the blood as a source of energy , turns to its reserve fat supplies for energy . As fat is used up , you lose weight . // * Frequent urination and excessive thirst . These symptoms are caused by a condition called hyperglycemia , or high blood sugar . In all people , whether they have diabetes or not , the blood circulates through the kidneys . These organs remove waste materials from the blood which are then expelled in urine . The kidneys also act like a " dam " to retain and recycle important nutrients such as sugar , sending them back into the blood . In diabetes , blood sugar rises to excessively high levels , which overwhelms the kidneys . They ca n't send all the sugar back into circulation , and it spills over the " dam " into the urine . Something else goes with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as you lose fluids , you get extra thirsty , your body 's signal to take in more fluids. // * Blurred vision . If you have high blood pressure , sugar can build up in the fluids of your eyes . The excess sugar draws water with it , causing the eye 's outer lens to swell , which distorts your vision . However , once you begin your diabetes treatment and your blood sugar gets back to more normal levels , your vision will clear . // * Other symptoms . Perhaps you had other symptoms of diabetes before your problem was identified . You may have experienced nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , weakness , or rapid shallow breathing . It 's even possible you experienced a diabetic coma prior to getting medical assistance . All of these symptoms can occur when your body uses stored fat instead of glucose as an alternative source of energy . // Whenever a person goes for long periods without food , it 's natural for the body to use stored fat for energy . As the body uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulate in the blood . Under normal circumstances , the level of ketones is low and harmless . // In diabetes , when there is not enough insulin to allow glucose to be used for energy , the body must rely exclusively on fat for its energy needs . As a result , high levels of both glucose and ketones accumulate in the blood and spill into the urine . This process is called ketosis and can lead to a serious problem called diabetic ketoacidosis , in which the acid in the blood is excessively high . Ketoacidosis can cause all of the symptoms described above and may even lead to diabetic coma , a life-threatening condition . // The Cause . Type I diabetes results from the destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas . Why does this occur ? Research during the past decade has brought us closer to an answer . As yet , scientists do n't know for sure , but they believe that most cases of Type I diabetes are caused when something has gone wrong in the body 's immune system . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing antibodies , substances that eliminate foreign invaders , such as bacteria and viruses . In certain cases , however , the immune system goes haywire and destroys the body 's own cells . Researchers believe that this is what happens in most cases of Type I diabetes . By mistake , the body destroys the beta cells of the pancreas , the very cells it needs to produce insulin. // Again , scientists do n't know why this happens . But heredity probably plays a role . In other words , there is a tendency for the problem to occur more frequently in certain families . Studies show that if one parent has Type I diabetes , a child has a 5 to 10 percent chance of developing the same condition . The risk rises to 20 percent when both parents have Type I diabetes . // New tests now make it possible to detect faulty immune antibodies in the blood  --  years before a person shows any of the common symptoms of diabetes . In adults , the destructive antibodies may be in the blood five or more years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beta cells does n't occur abruptly . Instead , it is a gradual process , taking place during what is called the " prediabetic stage . " Nationwide research studies are now being undertaken to look for ways to halt the destruction of the beta cells during this stage . For this reason , people with an immediate relative with Type I diabetes are being encouraged to be tested for the presence of faulty antibodies that may lead to diabetes . If they are detected , perhaps these people can be given a treatment that would prevent further destruction of the beta cells . Insulin , itself , is one possible treatment being studied to prevent diabetes . You can contact Joslin Diabetes Center for the latest information on these prevention studies , and for information on how to be screened . // Type II : Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes // Type II diabetes is the most common kind of diabetes , accounting for about 90 percent of all cases . Until recently , Type II diabetes was referred to as " maturity-onset " diabetes because it occurs most often in mature adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have Type II diabetes , your beta cells can still produce insulin . But unfortunately , there is n't enough to meet the present needs of your body . Compounding the problem , your body 's cells ca n't respond properly to the available insulin to let glucose inside . People with Type II diabetes usually do not depend on insulin injections to survive . That 's why it is now often called non-insulin-dependent diabetes . However , it 's important to note that some people with this type of diabetes may still need daily injections of insulin to maintain good health . // The Symptoms . A number of symptoms are associated with Type II diabetes , which , in many ways , are similar to those found with Type I diabetes . // * Lack of energy . When sugar ca n't enter your body 's cells , they ca n't use it for energy , and this can lead to fatigue . In short , you 're plumb out of energy . // * Increased hunger . Unable to use the available sugar for energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hunger pangs. // * Weight loss . Unable to use the sugar in the bloodstream , the body gets its energy from stored fat . As these fat stores are used up , you lose weight . * Hyperglycemia . If the body is unable to use the glucose in the bloodstream , it starts to " back up . " When it accumulates to a certain point , it creates the condition called hyperglycemia , or high blood sugar . // * Blurred vision . High blood sugar can lead to a buildup of sugar in the eye fluids . The excess sugar draws in water , causing the eye 's outer lens to change shape , which distorts your vision . // * Frequent urination and excessive thirst . The circulating blood travels through the kidneys , where normally the unused sugar is recycled for later use or for storage . However , when the levels of blood sugar are unduly high , the kidneys are unable to recycle it all and the excess sugar spills into the urine , drawing additional water with it and resulting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and depleted of its normal amount of fluids , your body sends out thirst signals , telling you to drink more fluids. // * Irritation and damage to the nerves . Also caused by high blood sugar , an early sign of this problem can be leg pains during the night . If this condition is allowed to continue , a serious complication called neuropathy may develop . // * Suppression of the immune system . Symptoms such as infections and slow healing often signal the onset of Type II diabetes . When blood sugar is high , the immune system becomes less effective , slowing the healing process , while cold and flu viruses , which your body can usually overcome in a relatively short time , may linger on indefinitely . In women with diabetes , suppression of the immune system can lead to vaginal infections by fungi or bacteria which may cause severe vaginal itching and can be very uncomfortable . // * Other symptoms . Problems with sexual functions are reported by men and women in both Type I and Type II diabetes . Men with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or maintain an erection , because high blood glucose can damage the nerves controlling the flow of blood into the penis or damage the blood vessels themselves . Women may experience sexual problems as well . Although little is known about this complication , high levels of blood glucose can cause changes or decreases in vaginal lubrication which may make intercourse painful . // * Some people discover that mood changes develop along with some of the other symptoms of both Type I and Type II diabetes . For example , you may feel less enthusiasm for your day-to-day activities . In reality , such mood changes are probably not caused directly by diabetes . It 's more likely that the gradual loss of energy , along with the other symptoms of diabetes , may cause some people to feel unwell , which , in turn , affects their outlook on life . // The Cause . Researchers do not know what causes Type II diabetes . They have determined , however , that there is no single cause . Instead , the condition seems to be brought on by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from person to person : // Insulin Resistance . Insulin resistance occurs when the body " resists " taking sugar into its cells . This may happen because : ( 1 ) the insulin ca n't link with the receptors on the surfaces of cells because there are n't enough receptors ; or ( 2 ) something goes wrong in the chemical reaction at the time of linking . In either situation , the body ca n't use the sugar in the blood and high blood sugar develops , bringing on the symptoms of diabetes . // Defect in the Beta Cells . In a normal pancreas , the beta cells release the right amount of insulin at the proper rate . After a meal , the surge is very rapid , and once the sugar has been used for the body 's immediate energy , the rest is stored as glycogen or fat . The rate at which insulin is released then decreases , keeping blood sugar levels in the normal range of 60-140 mg/dl. // The beta cells of people with Type II diabetes are often able to secrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reason these cells ca n't respond immediately to the rising levels of glucose . This results in a delay in the release of insulin , and by the time the beta cells get around to the job , high levels of sugar may already have built up in the blood . // Reduced Number of Beta Cells . One way to remedy the " delayed-action " situation is for the beta cells to produce more insulin . In theory , the additional insulin would then take care of the excess sugar , that built up during the delay . Unfortunately , people with Type II diabetes often have fewer beta cells than normal . Even though these beta cells can make insulin , they ca n't make enough to handle the excess blood sugar caused by the delay . // Other Factors . Researchers do n't know what causes insulin resistance or why beta cells become defective or reduced in number . However , one contributing factor is heredity  --  the tendency to pass on traits from one generation to the next . Studies show that if one parent has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 30 percent chance of developing the condition . If both parents have this type of diabetes , the risk may be as high as 50-75 percent . Additional evidence shows that if one twin develops Type II diabetes , there 's a 75 percent or greater chance the other will , too . Thus , heredity is an important factor in a person 's chance of having insulin resistance , defective beta cells , or a reduced number of beta cells . And sometimes , the combination of these conditions also leads to relative insulin deficiency . In such cases , the body produces an amount of insulin that would be enough under normal conditions . However , it 's not enough to overcome insulin resistance . // Excess body weight also plays a part in insulin resistance . If you already have a genetic potential for insulin resistance , then excess weight can kick it into gear . More than 80 percent of all people diagnosed with Type II diabetes were overweight before the disease developed . By losing weight , many of these people can increase the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells . They still have diabetes , but by making their cells less resistant to insulin , they can gain better control of their blood sugar . // Age also is a factor in Type II diabetes . Research shows that after age 50 , a larger percentage of people begin to have trouble keeping their blood sugar in normal range . After age 65 , as much as 20 percent of the population has diabetes ( compared with 5 percent overall ) . Scientists believe that as people mature , their cells are more likely to develop resistance to insulin . The aging process also causes changes in body composition . We tend to have less muscle and more fat tissue later in life , which can affect the way the body uses blood sugar . // Thus , for a variety of reasons , high blood sugar develops when your body ca n't produce or properly use insulin . But high blood sugar can make the problem even worse . How ? Excess sugar in your blood may further damage your beta cells , making them less able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the surfaces of cells . It is a vicious cycle  --  the higher your blood sugar goes , the more difficult it is for the body to bring it back to normal . That 's why , once diabetes has been diagnosed , it is vitally important to get it under control and keep it under control ! // Other Types of Diabetes // While most people with diabetes have either Type I or Type II , there are also a few less common forms of the disease . // Gestational Diabetes . Gestation refers to the time period in which a woman is pregnant . Gestational diabetes is a condition in women who do n't have the common form of diabetes , but for some reason ca n't metabolize sugar normally during their pregnancy . These women may develop a true case of diabetes after the baby is born , either right after the birth or some years later . It 's important to manage gestational diabetes to avoid complications for the mother and the baby . // Impaired Glucose Tolerance . A similar condition is called impaired glucose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sugar in the blood is not normal , but it has not yet reached the level at which actual diabetes can be diagnosed . Impaired glucose tolerance can be diagnosed by giving a patient a glucose tolerance test ( described below ) . People with this problem will show an abnormal response to the test because their bodies ( 1 ) do n't produce enough insulin , ( 2 ) do n't produce it fast enough , or ( 3 ) ca n't use the insulin properly to reduce blood sugars in a normal way . People with impaired glucose tolerance usually do n't have the classic symptoms of diabetes . Even so , some may eventually develop diabetes . But for others , blood sugar levels may return to normal without treatment . However , people with this condition should take special care to maintain normal body weight and to watch for the symptoms of diabetes . // Diagnosing Diabetes // Diabetes is diagnosed in a number of ways . Often you may have some or all of the classic symptoms of diabetes . You may also have high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood test . To confirm the diagnosis of diabetes , your doctor may order more than one blood test , perhaps taking a reading at different times of day . // Remember , you have glucose in your blood at all times . The question is : How much ? The normal level ranges from 60-140 mg/dl if you have just eaten . A test result of more than 200 mg/dl taken one to two hours after a meal , or a fasting blood sugar level of over 140 mg/dl , is usually enough to raise strong suspicion of diabetes : However , if glucose levels are " borderline , " a glucose tolerance test may be used to diagnose diabetes . In this test , you eat a large amount of carbohydrates for three days before the test . On the day of the test , having fasted since dinner the night before , your blood glucose level is measured . You then drink a glucose solution and the blood is retested at regular intervals to see how the body handles the glucose . // Urine testing is generally not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood glucose may not be high enough to spill over into the urine  --  even though the level in the blood is high enough to qualify as diabetes . A test called hemoglobin A1 ( see Chapter 10 ) may read " high " in someone with diabetes . However , there may be reasons other than diabetes for a false reading on the hemoglobin A1 test , for example , if a person has anemia . Therefore , experts do not recommend using this test by itself to diagnose diabetes . The person should always be tested for blood sugar levels . // After the Diagnosis // While a diagnosis of diabetes is never good news , it is not a cause for panic . But it is a cause for concern and immediate action . Once you 've gained a better understanding of the causes of diabetes and how it affects your body , you must then learn what you can do to keep your body functioning as normally as possible . //                @ @ @ @ @
