AUGUST 2001 The cricket hot night my husband died , my four year-old son , Pete , looked at me and said , " Now you 're a window , " and I did not correct the child . I was thirty-nine years old and worked at the local YMCA , which meant I gave workshops on how to record your life story . Pete said I taught " scribble scrabble . " My students were butchers and bakers and confused people . I also worked in the library at the community college where Ed taught world history . The night Ed died , I stayed up weeping and ironing his shirts . We lived in a little yellow house in Ash Creek , Ohio . Ash Creek is not a suburb of anywhere . It 's a mostly white town , but the two gas stations and cleaners and pizza place were owned by Indians from India . There 's an air force base not too far away . I 'm a homing pigeon . I grew up in Ash Creek , went one hundred miles west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not quite sure what to do with this widow thing . Some people turn away when they see us on the street , and others give Pete and me a look that makes me feel like we 're supposed to be inside with the shades down . Last night Pete lay in bed , kicking his sheep and-donkey sheets off him , and said , " Why do n't you get to be a baby twice ? " I lay next to him for a while after he fell asleep . Then I got up and threw a pair of my husband 's old shoes in the garbage . This morning when Pete saw the shoes in the garbage , he pulled them out , brushed off the eggshells , and said , " Do n't you ever throw anything away of Daddy 's ever . " He dragged a chair to Ed 's closet and yanked down all of Ed 's shirts , then hauled them to his own closet and hung them on the pole next to his littleshirts on little hangers . One of my students confided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy . " I feel like I 'm seventy . My aunt Barbara says loss does n't make you stronger like they tell you in books . She says loss makes you weaker . I would n't say that , just that when I walk down the street , I 'm stunned there are so many people who are alive . Ed died at five thirty in the afternoon . Pete and I were sitting on the couch watching a Blue 's Clues video from the library . The tape was a little wobbly . I got up to adjust the tracking , and then I went in to check on Ed . He lay there still as a board in his hospital bed . I ran in to get Pete . " Daddy is going to stop breathing soon , " I said . " How do you know ? " said Pete . " Come here . " I held out my hand . " Do n't rewind it , " said Pete , pointing to the video . We went into the room holding hands , and Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Ed and kissed his face . I held Ed 's hand , and he stopped breathing . " He stopped breathing , " I whispered . Pete did n't look at me . He just kept kissing Ed 's face and said solemnly , " I guess you wo n't be having any more birthday parties . " I called the funeral home , and they said , " We can be right over , ma'am . " " No , please , " I said . Now a thunderstorm was crashing outside . " No , please give us two hours . " I can not account exactly for those two hours . There was a time in the Middle Ages when the king decided to change the calendar and people marched around with signs that said , " Give us back our twelve days . " I had the sense that someone had altered time like that in those two hours . I do know that Pete kept doing cartwheels , over and over . Two men in suits and hats , who appeared to be from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete kept saying to them , " How are you going to fit Daddy out the door ? " but they did not respond . We have a narrow front door and back door , and the hallway hooks around so that we had to return a refrigerator we 'd ordered , because it was too big . They told us to leave the room while they wrapped him up , and then they put him on what looked like a hospital gurney and wheeled him out . They tipped him up around the corner . They managed . Pete and I stood out in the pouring rain as the men in suits placed Ed in the back of a black van . Our neighbor Thomas came out and stood on his porch with a coffee cup in his hand . He has prematurely white hair and blue eyes and was wearing muslin clothes because he works as a cooper at Hill House , the eighteenth century colonial restoration outside of town . When Ed was fading , Thomas used to leave things on our porch . Once he left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another time he left a small burlap bag of a colonial pancake mix . Unfortunately one of the dogs from down the street chewed on the pancake mix in the night . After the men from the funeral home left , I picked up Pete and carried him back inside . He was a big kid , but there he was in my arms , like a baby . I made peanut butter sandwiches , and we watched the rest of the Blue 's Clues video . " Now we 're two , " said Pete . " What ? " " Now we 're two people , " he said . *** I 'm Jewish , which means that for two thousand years my family always married Jews , until I married Ed , who was the son of a Mennonite minister . It does not mean that I 'm religious . One year I did make a messily braided challah bread for the annual bake sale at the library . Although I heard several people walk by it displayed on the table filled with Rice Krispies treats and pumpkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ended up taking it home for Ed and myself at the end of the day . It means that every so often when I look out the front window , I imagine I 'm Anne Frank , but it does n't mean I know Hebrew or am opposed to Christmas trees . In my case , it means I have olive skin and big breasts , even though I 'm only a little over five feet tall . My father died soon after Pete was born . He was a pharmacist in town and my mother was a homemaker . Every time my father met someone new he 'd say , " My bride 's so neat . When I get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom , she makes the bed . " He always called her his bride . She died ten months later , the day after Pete began to walk . People kept bringing food after Ed 's funeral . Casseroles were stacked on top of the refrigerator . It looked like I was going to have a Tupperware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down different desserts : a cheesecake , a cherry pie , gooey chocolate chip cookies . And when I could n't stand it anymore , I threw platefuls out the back door for the birds and the raccoons . Pete said , " When will everything be regular ? " Last night a telemarketer called and Pete answered the phone , " **25;106;TOOLONG ? " he says in one breath . I believe it was a telemarketer , because he replied , " No , he died . " When we knew Ed was going to die , we went to the cemetery and checked it out . We left Pete with a sitter for the afternoon . The man who showed us around held a transistor radio to his ear and was listening to a Reds game as he showed us around . " Do you want a two plot or a four plot , or a six-pack ? " I grabbed Ed 's hand tightly and said , " We 'll just get a double for now . " " Now , do you want to be buried foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went to a coffee shop and ordered cheeseburgers for both of us , shared a chocolate milk shake , then went home and made love before I went to pick up Pete . I 've been doing widow research at the library . In India , Hindu women really are supposed to " manifest inconsolable grief for the rest of their lives " after their husbands die . In Swaziland , widows wear a heavy saddle of twisted grass . Here , people came to the door with pesto sauce and gift certificates for massages , but sometimes I feel like I 'm wearing a heavy saddle of twisted grass . In a town in Ireland , widows wear black for one year and then lavender for another after their husbands die . That might solve my clothes dilemma , because I have never quite gotten the hang of it . I would like a uniform of some kind , although lavender might make me look washed out . Pete got into bed with me this morning and said , " I want to be a veterinarian . We could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly I want a pig . " " A pig . " " I want a real pig to pick me up from school . " " But he could n't carry your lunch box the way I do while you play on the playground . " " He could just hook it on his ear , " said Pete solemnly .
