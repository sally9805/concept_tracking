Meg had been sleeping when something woke her , something slight as the scratch of a mouse . She came into the kitchen to find her stepmother standing at the stove , writing a note . It was the middle of the night , and there was only the stove light on . Meg wondered how Alison could write in the dark or why she wanted to . Slowly she took things in : Alison 's shoulder bag was hanging on her shoulder ; she was fully dressed ; in her left hand under the purse , she dangled car keys . Meg thought , I should n't have said there was n't enough money for the pizza . Why did I tell her ? <p> <p> Alison said , " I just wrote you a note . Should have guessed you 'd get the vibrations and wake up . " <p> <p> Meg felt embarrassed because she wore only a thin T-shirt . She reached for the note and crossed her arms over her chest while she read . The pose made her feel even shyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made up my mind and I am going for good . Here is what you need to do : <p> <p> Meg stopped reading . " But you just got back . Susannah said you were going to start work again . " <p> <p> " I came for some things . " <p> <p> " Oh . " Meg saw there was luggage piled by the front door . She turned back to the note . <p> <p> For old times sake give me a couple of days start and then you go to the school authorities and tell them you need foster care . <p> <p> Meg 's heart sank . " Where will you be going ? " <p> <p> " I ca n't tell you that . Someone might get it out of you . " <p> <p> " For how long ? Is this about a job ? " Meg asked , but she saw by Alison 's face , it was n't about a job . <p> <p> Alison said , " I have to get going . I did n't want to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wondered if there was something terrible she did n't know . " Why go in the middle of the night ? Why not start after breakfast ? " <p> <p> " This is best . " <p> <p> Her stepmother moved toward the suitcases  --  two big tweedy things plus an ample weekender and a smaller satchel , all of which looked like the kind of luggage rich people carried . And a cardboard box . In the satchel , the round hairbrush was sticking up . Funny . Meg had heard the note-writing , not the packing . <p> <p> " You might change your mind , " Meg said gently . It had happened before . <p> <p> " No . " <p> <p> " We could wait a bit before doing anything . " <p> <p> Alison hesitated . " I do n't know . I made up my mind . I 'm no good at this . I 'm not cut out for it . I never counted on it when I met your father . It was bad enough there were four of you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long . " <p> <p> Maybe Alison had loved them a little , in spite of herself , Meg thought , even though the initial staying had more to do with their father 's insurance and the house they 'd owned  --  until Alison sold it  --  than it did with them . <p> <p> " I would n't wait much past three days , you hear . Get yourselves some foster care . Okay ? Just wait a little for my sake . " <p> <p> " You 'll call ? " Meg asked . " Just to  --  " She did n't say the rest about being sure before they did anything . <p> <p> " Best we forget we ever knew each other , " Alison said softly . <p> <p> Meg sat down on the kitchen chair , hitting harder than she intended . The hard jolt the chair gave her spine seemed the mark of some sort of defeat . <p> <p> Alison took the note from her , crumpled it , and began to throw it in the trash . Then she paused and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you questions . Just keep saying you do n't know . You could get me in a whole bunch of trouble , so just say the last you knew I met somebody , I left , went you do n't know where . That 's the simplest . I did well by you guys ; I tried , anyway . " Alison fumbled to get her checkbook from her purse . She searched for a pen , finally found one , and wrote a check . <p> <p> Meg looked at the tan mules her stepmother favored , toeless and with a narrow heel . Alison wore a short brown clingy dress with a little black sweater . She always tried to look like a kid . Their father had wanted to get them a mother , but he ended up getting them a person who was trying to be a teenager . <p> <p> Alison put the check on the hall table and came back to the kitchen . Suddenly there was something that passed for a hug and kiss . Meg threw her arms around her stepmother and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Even she could n't explain the hug . It was just that anybody she ever knew , she kind of loved . " Will you be okay ? " Meg asked . <p> <p> Her question started Alison crying . " Do n't . . . do n't . I 'm counting on you to do the right thing . You understand ? Let me be and then get yourselves some parents . " <p> <p> Meg would have liked to be angry with Alison , but the truth was , she understood her . Alison had n't bargained on any of this , four kids and , the last two years , no man in her life . She 'd craved romance and got hard-knocks reality . Alison was going to meet a man  --  that was clear from the high excitement and triumph underneath her apologies . <p> <p> Alison broke the embrace and picked up the luggage  --  enough luggage to hold just about everything she owned . <p> <p> Meg went to reach for one of the tweed bags , but Alison said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , too . " Meg stood helpless as her stepmother went to the car once , then twice . Finally Alison put the last piece of luggage and the cardboard box in the trunk . She kissed her fingers in farewell , got behind the wheel , and started up the car , but she did n't start out right away . The moment stretched to three minutes . <p> <p> Meg watched , thinking , I 've done it , I 've turned her around . <p> <p> Alison put the old Civic into gear . Still she did n't move . <p> <p> The stars were visible , and a half moon washed the closely parked cars in an eerie light . The car motor made its familiar coughing sound . Suddenly , the car and its driver were gone . <p> <p> The night was chilly . Meg did n't put on a robe or a sweater . She did n't go back to bed . She sat still at the kitchen table for a long time , hearing the memory of the car driving away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate . Alison wanted to get far enough away that nobody could find her if Meg rebelled and called the police . <p> <p> Meg thought about how to tell the others in the morning that their stepmother had come back for a few days only to take off again and this time it was for good . <p> <p> The check sat on the " hall table "  --  it was really just redwood outdoor furniture , although it was nicely made  --  nearest the front door used for schoolbooks and mail . Meg was the one who found the table outside Keystone Plumbing , on sale for ten bucks , and she thought it could substitute for one about the same size her stepmother had sold when they downsized from a house in Greenfield to this little saltbox . " Only ten bucks , and sturdy , " she 'd come home saying , and Alison told her she sounded like an old woman . <p> <p> The comment stung . Meg did not want to be an old woman , but she supposed she was . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many ways , too , of her mother when she was alive , her stepmother , and even her father . She wanted to be like . . . not like her classmates , exactly , but like some kids her age . Pretty , laughing , music-playing kids . Old woman . Her schoolbooks were stacked neatly . Her class was giving book reports . She was doing A Tale of Two Cities tomorrow , one of her father 's favorite books . She was finished preparing , had been for a week . Math done . Geography done . <p> <p> Meg got up and looked at the check . Forty bucks . She could make it on that for a long time . Alison had no sense of money  --  she had told Susannah to call for a pizza today , and all she had to pay for it was five dollars and something . The man had been nice , letting them have it . <p> <p> She put on the television so low , there were no discernible words , only a murmur . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were talking about so earnestly . Then a movie in which people raised their eyebrows every time they spoke , but she could n't hear the words of that either and could n't read the lips and did n't turn up the sound . After a while she let the light of the television flicker over her like firelight . She had the idea that if she concentrated on the thought hard enough , her stepmother would turn around and come back . She was gone three days the first time she left , almost a week the second time . Meg 's vision was clear , a dream with a sound track . She 'd hear the unmistakable sound of the cranky used has-been car , and she would go to the window and welcome Alison back . <p> <p> At about half past four in the morning , she took her school copy of the Dickens novel from the table and read certain sections all over again , just because she liked them . <p> <p> She read all night , letting the book take her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her English class , floating , looking out the school window , thinking : She was a good caretaker ; if only some agency would give her money , she could keep the family going just fine . She had to get after Joel sometimes , but when she tried to imagine being without him , any of them , she could n't stand it . She knew exactly how Susannah 's hair curled when it dried , she knew Joel 's moods , she knew when Laurie 's eyes would close in front of the TV . And they would n't be okay without her , they just would n't . <p> <p> " It 's a story of human frailty , " the English teacher was saying . Ms. Blair liked to be dramatic . She had matte black hair that she always pulled back tight into a knot . Most days she wore scarves and big earrings . <p> <p> Images of her own mother came to Meg . Little bits . The way she had moved , as if she were onstage . Lighting a cigarette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in an ashtray . Fingers through her hair , a hip out , her sassy pose . And pretty , kind of like Alison , but with a lot more attitude . " Troubled , " her father had said once , when they talked late into the night . He never said crazy . Troubled , unhappy , those were his words . Joel remembered her . Laurie hardly did . Susannah did n't . Brilliant . Their mother was brilliant , everybody said so . Read all kinds of things , was always in a fever , and not too nice to their father who was plenty intelligent but not smart enough for her  --  not brilliant . <p> <p> Well , their mother had given them brains , anyway . Their father had given them kindness . He used to say something of the sort , sitting up at night , talking with Meg . She had to agree about her father anyway . He had had pained , gentle eyes , a soft voice . He never hurt anyone . <p> <p> " Did you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ms. Blair , was asking Jordan Zugaro , the boy who had done the first report . <p> <p> His answer was an unpleasant snorting laugh meant to let his classmates know how stupid the teacher 's questions were . <p> <p> " What do the rest of you think ? Rob ? Pete ? Any answers ? John ? " <p> <p> The boys rustled in their corrals , kicking at chair bottoms and book bags . <p> <p> The teacher said , " I give up . Meg ? Let 's have your report now . " <p> <p> Meg stood and went to the front of the room . She was n't sure her voice was going to work . On top of that , her report was eight times longer than anyone else 's . But she began and she persisted , explaining the plot , reading sections , and then telling her reaction to the novel . When she looked up , the sea of puzzled faces threw her . She wanted to say something else , something different . I 'm Meg . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the class . " What did you think of Meg 's report ? " <p> <p> " Long ! " one boy said , and several laughed . <p> <p> Then there was a tangle of voices saying that they did not want to be expected to match it and that it was more than they thought they were supposed to do . <p> <p> " It was excellent , " Ms. Blair said quietly . " You liked Sidney Carton ? Why ? Because he sacrificed himself ? " <p> <p> " I liked him even before he sacrificed himself . " <p> <p> Ms. Blair smiled . <p> <p> Finally class was over and everyone hurried out to lunch . The teacher called Meg back into the room . " Look , Meg , you ca n't stay in this school system next year . It 's ridiculous . You 're so far ahead of the others . You need AP classes . " <p> <p> " Well , maybe , I guess . " <p> <p> " I have to intervene , " Ms. Blair said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand the waste . Have your mother call me . " <p> <p> Meg nodded slightly and left . Then she stood at the fringes of the cafeteria line , stretching , looking at the free meal , hoping Joel and Laurie and Susannah would listen to her and eat everything coming to them so she could stretch that forty dollars for as long as they needed . In front of her , thick brown gravy sat like mud over ground meat . Memory conjured the taste of cheap beef and salt and fat , making her mouth water and her stomach heave at the same time . She chose it because the other choice was tubes of pasta with red sauce , and they ate pasta all the time . <p> <p> She ducked toward a corner booth and opened a book because she was n't in the mood to talk to anybody . If she talked , she might cry ; she ate her lunch , pretending to study , while other kids played the game of constantly shifting seats . <p> <p> She managed to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Algebra when the counselor , Ms. Stephanyak , leaned out , chomping on a carrot , and called her over . " How 's your mother doing ? " <p> <p> Meg tried to hit a level , ordinary tone of voice . " Okay . Working hard , " she said . <p> <p> " I 'll try calling again . I have n't been able to get hold of her . You do n't have your answering machine on . " <p> <p> " We do n't have one . " <p> <p> " Ms. Blair was just talking to me about you . You 're doing very well . Time to talk to your mother about some options . " <p> <p> She imagined herself blurting it all out suddenly . You need to report that we need a foster home . Instead she said , " Thanks . I 'll have her call you . I have to get to class right now . " Why could n't things just go on and on ? They always had . <p> <p> A voice behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was Patrice who caught up with her . Patrice was large and black , with soft eyes and oiled-down hair . She was good in school , as Meg was . " Ca n't wait to get out of here . " <p> <p> " I do n't mind it , I guess . " Meg looked at the old walls and lockers , wondering where she would end up , where her siblings would end up . <p> <p> Then she and Patrice were at the Algebra classroom and they parted to take their assigned seats . Somehow Meg answered correctly what a fulcrum was , and replied , when asked , what result she 'd got on certain workbook problems . Which , it turned out , she 'd done correctly . The other half of her mind was on how she would catch Laurie after school , have Laurie walk Susannah home slowly while she rushed over to East Ohio Street to cash the check and ran back to catch up with them . She worked out shopping lists in her head . Forty dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over . Finally she got to the bank . <p> <p> The only available teller , a tough-looking woman with a cap of nappy hair and a jacket with epaulets , looked at Meg suspiciously , turned the piece of paper over a couple of times , and took on a very official tone . " You tell this person with the account  --  I remember her . . . Is she your mother ? " <p> <p> It was n't exactly true , but Meg managed a nod . <p> <p> " Tell her to come in . She has a low balance in the account and if she wants to get money out she needs to be the one to cash it because it would close out the account . And it needs to be signed here . You tellher to come in . " <p> <p> Meg said , " Thank you . I will . " <p> <p> She left the bank without anything . For a moment on her way home , she thought she heard her stepmother 's car . But when she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Meg took her backpack into the bedroom and changed out of her school clothes . She heard Joel come into the house , his sounds . Good . She had to sit them down and talk to them . <p> <p> Nothing in the cupboards . No , not quite true . Three slices of old bread , a pat of butter . It would have to do . <p> <p> " Are you changing clothes ? " she called out . <p> <p> " Yeah , " Joel called back . <p> <p> " Good . " <p> <p> Laurie came up from the basement and began sweeping the kitchen floor . " For once ! " she said , " he remembers to change his clothes . " She was three years younger than Meg . She had reported earlier that detergent was low . Laurie 's glasses slipped down on her nose all the time and they perched there now , giving her a quizzical look . " We 're out of everything . " <p> <p> " There 's a half inch of dish detergent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make that go far . " <p> <p> Laurie sighed and nodded . <p> <p> " Where 's Susannah ? " <p> <p> " She 's sitting on the basement steps , drawing . " <p> <p> " Good . " <p> <p> They heard Joel come to sit in the living room . <p> <p> She went into the living room and saw his two books on the table in front of him , saw that he was far down in spirits , as if he knew already . He opened one of his books and sat back , reading . <p> <p> " I need to talk to everybody , " she said . " Could you get Suse ? Could we all come in here ? " <p> <p> " Susannah ! " Laurie called . Susannah clattered up the steps . It was clear to Meg they were all expecting something . They knew , but they did n't want to know . Laurie sat on the couch and Susannah scrunched up next to her . <p> <p> " Did you eat a lot at the cafeteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> " That 's good because . . . " <p> <p> " There is n't anything , " Laurie said . " Nothing . " <p> <p> Meg looked at them evenly . " Things are bad . Things are real bad . " They waited . " Alison left for good , " she said at last . " I was thinking she was going to stay this time . But she only came back to get her things . She 's gone . " <p> <p> " Where ? " was all Joel asked . <p> <p> " I do n't know . " <p> <p> " She 'll be back , " Laurie said miserably . " Even though we do n't want her . " <p> <p> Meg paused . " She took all her clothes . Really everything . " <p> <p> The other three waited patiently for more . They did not seem particularly surprised . <p> <p> " I 'm glad she 's gone , " Laurie said . " I do n't miss her at all . She 's a whacko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . here 's the thing . One way or another , she brought a little money into the house . We 're stuck without that . " <p> <p> " She sold our house , " Laurie muttered . " Where 's all that money ? " <p> <p> " It 's gone . " <p> <p> " What does she expect us to do ? " Laurie asked . <p> <p> " I tried to cash one of her checks today , but it did n't work . She never did understand money . What Alison said . . . she told me we need to turn ourselves in . She wanted me to do it in a couple of days , but I . . . could go to the school office tomorrow if you all want . " <p> <p> Joel had put down his book at the phrase turn ourselves in . <p> <p> Laurie asked tersely , " How ? " <p> <p> " I suppose we could go to the police , too . If we hang on through tomorrow , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the weekend . " <p> <p> Joel said , " No . There has to be something we can do . " <p> <p> Susannah 's lip was trembling . Laurie soothed her by smoothing her hair and saying , " Shh . We 'll figure it out . " <p> <p> Joel muttered , " She spent all our money . She could have gotten something for us , welfare , why did n't she ? " <p> <p> Meg said , " I do n't know . She did n't like agencies . " <p> <p> Laurie said , " We 're better off without her , " but she said it mostly to Susannah . <p> <p> " Well , " Meg explained , " she was right about one thing . We need help . We ca n't make it for long . " <p> <p> " But we do n't want foster parents , " Joel said . <p> <p> " I know , " Meg said . <p> <p> " Do you ? " Laurie asked . " Want to end up with strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . Ever . No , I do n't want it . " <p> <p> " Do n't want it , " Joel said , raising a hand , as if voting . <p> <p> " Do n't either , " Laurie said , raising her hand . And of course Susannah followed them . <p> <p> " We 're fine the way we are , " Laurie said brightly . " Alison never did anything except smoke and look for boyfriends . " <p> <p> " We have no money , " Meg cried out . " And we need food . " <p> <p> Joel went silent . Laurie , on the other hand , was energized by the problem . " School is out in three weeks , right ? We could babysit nights for now and babysit all the daytime in summer . I could . Add it up . We do n't need to give ourselves up . " <p> <p> Meg felt herself falter . She 'd been thinking , if she lied about her age , she could possibly get hired somewhere . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? " <p> <p> " We all have to get work , " he said , " something , at least until school is out , right ? That 's only three weeks . " <p> <p> " There 's rent , " Meg said . " And utilities . " <p> <p> " We can try it . We can try for a couple of days anyway , ca n't we ? " <p> <p> They did the dishes and tidied the house until six . <p> <p> They sat and read , all in the same room . At seven o'clock , when the hunger was fierce , they made three pieces of toast and split each piece four ways  --  twelve pieces divided by four . <p> <p> They were watching television at eight , but the volume could n't disguise Susannah 's stomach growl . Meg suddenly could n't stand it and she sprang up . " Be back in a minute , " she said . <p> <p> She crossed the street to the pizza shop . Yes , the same man was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so glad you 're still here , " she said breathlessly . <p> <p> " Just turned the ovens off . Sorry . " <p> <p> To her great distress , she felt herself starting to choke up . " I need to get a job . I can learn anything . I can cook , clean . I could definitely make pizza or work the counter . A couple of hours even would help . " <p> <p> The man started looking around . He took a drink from a bottle of beer . " I ca n't , " he said . " You 're too young . Some rough people come in here . How old are you ? " <p> <p> She wanted to lie . But she told the truth . " Almost fourteen . I wo n't tell . I noticed you work long hours and I thought maybe you might want a break . " <p> <p> " You hit that right . I was sneaking out early tonight . " <p> <p> " I could work for you , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give . " <p> <p> A trick of the light made him look like he might cry . He had beautiful eyes , a light blue , and they seemed to open up like the sky . She turned to the door . <p> <p> " Here , " he said . " You 're in luck . This has been sitting around for hours . Never got picked up . " <p> <p> Her eyes widened . Was he just giving it ? <p> <p> " And , just a second . Here 's some dough . Some cheese . You 'd know what to do with these ? Your parents would ? " <p> <p> " Yes . Oh , yes , thanks . When I get some money  --  " <p> <p> " Are you kidding ? These are throwaways . " <p> <p> Meg ran home . She had n't gotten the job she most wanted , but there were other places she could try tomorrow . As soon as she entered the house , she felt the other three dive toward her . <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can just have it ? " Laurie asked . " What did you say ?
