TONY WAS A FIREMAN ; he 'd wanted to be a fireman since he was a little boy . He was twenty-four now ; maybe he 'd wanted to be a fireman for twenty years . He was happy because his dreams had come true ; he 'd been a fireman now for six years . He loved fighting fires . He hoped one day to save a child , to save a child from a very big fire . That would be the height of his career , and he might even get a medal from the mayor , but that did n't really matter . What mattered was the look on the mother 's face when he handed her smudged and coughing little girl into her arms and said , " She 's OK now , ma'am . " <p> That 's what he thought about and dreamed about-that and daguerreotypes . Daguerreotypes are old photographs , but special ones made on silver . They do n't look like other old or new photographs . The people in daguerreotypes have all been dead for over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even than the people in Tony 's pictures of his high-school graduation and the prom , and several of him in front of the fire station or with his fellow firemen , or even the pictures his father had made just last Christmas of all the family sitting around the tree . Tony had some daguerreotypes , and he looked at them every day . He even joined a daguerreotype club and went to meetings . His mother sometimes said to him-because he still lived at home when he was n't at the fire station- " Do n't let those daguerreotypes become an obsession with you ; I 'm afraid they 're becoming an obsession with you . " <p> His mother said this because she often heard him talking in his room at night , and at first she thought he was praying , but once when he was particularly loud , she went up and listened at his door , and she heard him moaning . She was worried it was something he ate . She 'd fixed spaghetti that night for supper and had accidentally used more garlic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was listening to a song on the radio that she liked a lot and she was thinking about how the woman in the song wanted a hero and she measured out a tablespoon of garlic powder ; so she thought it must have been the garlic powder . She tapped on his door and said , " Tony , honey , excuse me ; are you OK ? " And he said , " Oh yes , Mom ; I 'm just working with my daguerreotypes . " <p> Then it did n't happen again for a while , or at least she did n't notice , but then she heard him a few weeks later , and she was certain he was moaning , or crying out maybe . And her first thought was Tony 's got a girl up there with him , and they 're doing things right in our home ! She flew up the stairs and without knocking went right into Tony 's room , and she was ready to have her heart broken , but Tony was just sitting at his desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes on , and no one was in the room with him , and the bed was still perfectly made , just like she 'd left it early that morning . " What 's the matter , Mom ? " Tony cried out , knowing there had to be some emergency . " Oh , nothing ; I just had a bad dream about you , I guess , and was worried about you . " " I 'm fine , " Tony said . " That 's good , " she said , and she turned and left and felt odd . <p> It was after that that she started saying , " Do n't let those daguerreotypes become an obsession with you ; I 'm afraid they 're becoming an obsession with you . " Sometimes she said , " Do n't let those daguerreotypes get in the way of your firefighting ; you would n't want to miss a fire because of them . " When she said that , he wished she 'd burn up , and he imagined her in front of him talking but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would n't ever answer . He 'd just shrug and look at her like her head was on fire and he did n't care to put it out . He once said to her , " I could n't care less , " which was a lie , but he said it to anger her , and she screamed and said , " I 'm ashamed of you , Tony ; what would your father say ? " And she started to slap him , but he grabbed her hand and bent back her little finger until it broke . She was hysterical now and thought he 'd lost his mind . He put his hand over her mouth and said , " Do n't ever say the word daguerreotype again ; it 's my Jesus ; do you hear me ? It 's my Jesus . " <p> Now she knew he was badly obsessed , and she was very worried about him , though she was afraid to tell anyone for fear he would lose his job . On the way to the emergency room where Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell everyone she 'd bent her finger back in the screen door , that her screen door had always been " tricky . " All he said to that was how she ought to get it fixed and that he 'd fix it if he ever had time between fighting fires and working on his book . Her finger hurt too much for her to think about that word book right then , but she was a bit surprised because Tony had never been what she called " a reader . " <p> She was definitely " a reader " and had what her husband very proudly called " a good-sized library . " She liked novels-whole novels , not the condensed kind her next-door neighbor read and then always talked about as if she 'd read the whole thing . Later she did say to him , " Honey , what 's that book you 're reading ? " " What are you talking about ? " Tony replied . " You mentioned a book when we were on the way to the hospital following my accident , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm writing it ; I 'm not reading it , " he said with some displeasure . " Oh , why that 's wonderful , Tony ; I 'm so proud of you-your own book . Is it a novel ; what 's it about ? " " Daguerreotypes , " he replied . " Oh , " she said , and then went back to grating the carrots for a raisin-and-carrot salad . " It is a novel , though , Mom , " Tony said . <p> He did not tell her any more , but it was a novel about a heroic fireman who saved little girls and in his spare time made daguerreotypes of all the little girls in town . The title was Saved from Blazes . The fires the fireman saved the little girls from were always started by an evil English lord named Sir Devil . Sir Devil knew he had to defeat the fireman if he were to burn up the little girls as he had done back in the old country , because the mercury the fireman used to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . Sir Devil had to break the fireman 's camera and steal his mercury . The novel was becoming very long . Tony had written over five hundred pages , and there were terrible fires every few pages and many adults and boys were badly burned , and the fireman was making protective daguerreotypes of the girls as fast as he was fighting the fires . <p> Tony 's mother continued to worry about her son because the noise in his room in the evenings continued . She would listen at the door for hours , listen to him moaning . Her husband once overheard Tony and said to his wife , " Sounds like Tony 's got the bellyache . " She did n't know what to do . Finally she decided she had to read Tony 's book , and so when he went to the fire station she looked for it in his closet . She had noticed a big box on a shelf once when she was hanging up his shirts , and it was a shelf that had not previously had anything but shoeboxes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised at how much Tony had written . She thought , " Why , it 's longer than Gone with the Wind . " She read several pages and felt disturbed . She felt particularly disturbed when she read the sentence , " Sir Devil had a very sharp penis . " She did n't know what to make of that , and so she did n't read any more for several days . <p> But then she went back to it , because she was " a reader . " Some people , like her neighbor , could not read books that disturbed them , but she could . She had read Forever Amber and In Cold Blood ; they both disturbed her , but for different reasons . As she thought about Tony 's book , she thought how she would describe it as a mix of In Cold Blood and Forever Amber . She became interested in whether Sir Devil would find the fireman 's mercury . He had destroyed several of the fireman 's cameras but had never discovered the source of the mercury . She kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not like reading about the fires ; someone was always burned beyond recognition . Sir Devil seemed on the verge of discovering the source of the mercury when he began fighting the fireman with his computer , because the source of the mercury was the power disk the princess Dianna had slipped in the fireman 's brain one night as he slept . Each night mercury would flow from his eyetooth and roll into smooth balls in his sheets , and each morning he would collect them in his mercury chamber . Sir Devil 's computer got in touch with the power disk . Tony 's mother was very worried about what would happen . She thought about it all day and after fixing Tony his supper told him he better get on upstairs . He told her he was going out . Tony had not gone out in the evening-except to fight a fire-in years . She looked greatly disturbed . He told her that he was going on a date . Then she felt more disturbed . Tony had not gone on a date since he had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he also left after supper the following night . <p> After a week of Tony 's dating , she asked him when he started out , " Tony , what about your novel ? " " What novel ? " he said . " The one about daguerreotypes , " she replied . " Did n't I tell you never to say that word again in my presence ? " He looked very mean at her , then went out the door . After another week of his dating she felt as if she was going out of her mind , but she did n't dare ask him if Sir Devil 's computer had made the power disk stop manufacturing mercury and sending it through the fireman 's eyetooth . She decided she would have to trick him into telling her , so one evening as he ate his sandwich she asked if he had had his regular dental checkup . She said she noticed that his eyetooth looked a bit swollen . But Tony said , " It 's fine ; I 'm fine , " and left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Publication tract about the devil on the dining table , but Tony did n't pay any attention . Finally she went to the library and checked out a book about daguerreotypes and made a point of letting Tony see her reading it . Tony did not go out that night , and she was sure her plan had worked , but the next morning when she opened the closet , the box was n't there . Tony had left before breakfast and must have taken it with him . As she was thinking about this she happened to look out the window and noticed the garbageman emptying their can into the truck , and the box was on top . " No , no , no , " she screamed as she ran down the stairs and out the front door , but it was too late . The truck had moved down the street , and Saved from Blazes had been ground up with oranges and eggshells and Tide boxes . She was sad , and as angry with Tony as she was sad . <p> That night when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw your novel away . Do n't lie to me ; you threw it away . " He decided right then that he would have to set her on fire , even though he had hoped it would not come to this . He hit her in the head with a skillet and then set the house on fire . As a fireman , he knew all about fires and how to set them so they would look accidental , which is what he did . Then he left the house , went back to the station , and was there when the call came in . <p> He particularly enjoyed the ride on the truck , because he knew where he was going and knew there would be no young girls in danger . When the truck got close to his house , he screamed , " Oh , my God ; it 's my house ! " When the truck stopped , he rushed in . Then he rushed out and said , " I ca n't get to her . " Tony 's mother was burned " beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recounted the story , and his daguerreotypes melted . His father did n't know how he was going to cope . Tony suggested that he start dating . Tony told his father that dating had helped him and that he was going to marry a girl with very tiny feet ; he had been dating her . She was only a cobbler but walked like royalty . Her father had owned the Downtown Shoe Mart . He was dead now , and she owned it and repaired all the shoes herself , but she made her own shoes by hand , and she was going to make Tony 's too . Tony knew his life had finally turned in the right direction . <p>
