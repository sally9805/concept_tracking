<p> " I do n't know what your destiny will be , but one thing I know : the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who will have sought and found how to serve . "  --  Albert Schweitzer <p> Blue Light Linked to Eye Problems <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> My daughter uses a computer many hours a day and I noticed there is a blue light on the power button . There is also a blue light on her monitor . <p> Could you tell me if this is dangerous ? We have macular degeneration problems in our family . Could this increase her chances of getting cataracts and macular degeneration ? I 've read that blue light should be blocked . Margaret Riley Ottumwa , Iowa <p> <p> With the assistance of the American Academy of Ophthalmology , we received the following information regarding sources of blue light and possible exposure from computers , televisions , etc . <p> Stanford retina specialist Mike Marmor , M.D. , explained : " TVs and computers are not harmful in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoors and are just a refinement of UV blocking glasses or sunglasses . They are in some way sunglasses , because if blue is blocked , the glasses must have a yellow or orange cast . " <p> Seattle-based ophthalmologist Richard Bensinger , M.D. , adds : " As a matter of simplicity , blue is used as a generic term for that end of the spectrum containing higher energy waves . This is perceived as blue , violet , or beyond ( ultraviolet ) . It is these waves that have been speculated as causing damage to tissue and , indeed , are the probable cause of sun damage , sunburn , and perhaps cataracts and macular changes . So a ' blue blocker ' as a lens or a cream is anything attenuating that portion of the spectrum . Sunlight is by far the most intense natural source and it is , of course , more intense at higher altitudes . Indoor lighting rarely has enough density to cause any problem at all . For instance , the difference between bright outdoor sun and standard indoor illumination is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . Only in settings such as indoor tanning machines and certain types of lasers is artificial light a problem . " <p> Researchers suspect that there are several causes of cataract , including smoking , sun exposure , and aging . Smoking may also increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration , a leading cause of blindness . See page 34 for more on macular degeneration . Special Mattress May Aid Recovery After Eye Surgery <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> My mother was recently diagnosed with a macular hole . The ophthalmologist told her there is surgery to correct this condition . However , the down side is that you have to keep your head down for at least two weeks after the surgery . This means that she would have to lie on her stomach , or sit with her head down constantly . Unfortunately , my mother is unable to sit or lie in this position for so long . Is there any other type of procedure or treatment that can be done for this condition ? Shelbey Hinkelmann Rockford , Illinois <p> <p> Ophthalmologist Stephen Massicotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a general ophthalmologist , my understanding is that specialists remove the vitreous gel ( vitrectomy ) and ' peel ' any thin cellophane-like adhesions from the inner surface of the retina over the fovea  --  the central portion of the macula that allows central reading acuity and color vision perception  --  to repair a macular hole . <p> " In addition , injection of a gas into the interior of the eye to replace the vitreous gel that was removed aids in complete reattachment of the macula , since often it is detached just in the area of the macular hole . The gas bubble ' floats ' within the eye just like a carpenter 's level , and the surgeon wants the bubble to lie against the macula at the end of the surgery to help the eye heal and reattach the retina . <p> " The position required for this to happen is face down so that the bubble floats to the top ( back ) of the eye , pressing the macula against the inner coat of the eye so it will reattach over the first few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or face-down positioning after surgery , which can be a challenge for many seniors to maintain for that period of time . However , there are foam mattress devices available to help in this regard . I can say I have personally seen this surgery miraculously restore vision in my own patients . " Atrial Fibrillation Often Recurs <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation early in 2001 . My doctor then performed a successful cardioversion . I was no longer in AF . Approximately one year later I purchased a magnetic therapy mattress in hopes of improving my sleep . I slept on said mattress for six months or so . At my next scheduled cardiologist 's checkup , he informed me that I was back in AF . Although said mattress is not plugged into an electrical outlet , it nevertheless produces an electrical current . Is it possible that the current produced by the mattress affected the electrical impulses in my heart , thus putting me back in AF ? Charles Lambert Jenks , Oklahoma <p> <p> Heart-rhythm disorders expert Dr. Douglas Zipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the recurrence of your problem . <p> " Recurrences of atrial fibrillation after cardioversion are quite common , " Dr. Zipes said . " More likely than not , the condition happened spontaneously . " On Antidepressants and Bipolar Illness <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> A few years ago , a psychologist told me that if people who had the least tendency for bipolar depression took antidepressants , it could kick them into being bipolar . My medical doctor agreed , Now , a relative is telling me that her psychiatrist said this is not so . My mother suffered from bipolar depression . I do not need antidepressants at this point but am concerned for other family members . Could you please find the answer for me ? B. Houseworth Crete , Illinois <p> <p> Some people with bipolar illness are particularly sensitive to antidepressants and may respond with mania or rapid cycling ( switching quickly from depression to mania and back again ) , advises bipolar expert Dr. John Nurnberger , director of the Indiana University Institute of Psychiatric Research . Dr. Nurnberger continues : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorder with antidepressants unless they are first on a mood-stabilizing medicine such as lithium , valproate , carbamazepine , lamotrigine , or olanzapine . For people with a family history of bipolar disorder , a careful evaluation should precede any use of an antidepressant . ' <p> Dr. Nurnberger explains that people with depression may benefit from adding lithium to their current medicines . <p> " Lithium augmentation is well established to be effective in a number of cases when the original antidepressant is not effective , or only partially effective . This holds true for patients with unipolar depression as well as bipolar illness . We also use thyroid hormone or sometimes methylphenidate as augmenting agents . A response is usually seen within two weeks . " <p> A study published in the December 2003 issue of Pharmacopsychiatry suggests that lithium augmentation promotes the smooth flow of chemical messengers in the brain and nervous system . Reader Seeks Advice on Support Stockings <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> For the past year I 've suffered with DVT and am told it is due to an inherited genetic defect . Doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 ' 3 ? and weighing 150 pounds , I have had a terrible time finding hosiery that fits properly . Due to back , hip , and thumb problems , I find them very hard to put on . Could you tell me just how and when these should be worn , how they should fit , and information where to order properly fitted ones ? Pantyhose are out of the question . I have been wearing thigh-high hose , but they are always too long and wrinkle ; are the knee-high hose as effective ? I have a feeling there are many folks , especially women , who are having this same trouble . <p> I read and save all your columns and The Saturday Evening Post magazines . Thank you so very much for all the useful information . Sharon J. Kraft Klamath Falls , Oregon <p> <p> We ask readers to share their recommendations . The compression provided by a support stocking is greatest at the ankles and diminishes as it goes up the leg . This helps the blood and water to circulate towards the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , support stockings are usually removed before going to bed or lying down for more than one hour . <p> Support stockings should fit smoothly behind the knee . Knee-high support stockings are a good option for most patients . A prescription is required for maximum-support stockings . People with Sleep Apnea Need a Research-Minded Ophthalmologist <p> Genetic researchers like Dr. Craig Venter are our best hope to identify and in some way alter defective genes that lead to eye diseases . Armed with this information , young adults could know early on that they are at high risk for glaucoma or other vision-threatening conditions and take action to avoid the devastation that begins in old age . <p> A diagnosis of sleep apnea , a condition in which sleep is interrupted because air does not flow into or out of the nose or mouth , may also put one at risk for developing glaucoma . In fact , Harvard researchers say that about half of all normal-tension glaucoma patients and one third of all primary open-angle glaucoma patients suffer from obstructive sleep apnea . Investigators continue to study the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have their optic discs checked regularly even if their ocular pressure is normal . Normal-tension and low-tension glaucoma can be overlooked during a routine glaucoma screening procedure . Radiation Therapy and Chronic Diarrhea <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I am wondering how many people suffer from diarrhea after having radiation therapy and what if anything can be done . <p> I had a complete hysterectomy in 1982 due to endometrial cancer stage 1 , followed by radiation . I had diarrhea during treatment ; however , it ceased after several weeks only to return a year or so later . I have now put up with this malady for almost 20 years . <p> I have tried controlling it by cutting out certain foods , taking Metamucil , eating no dairy foods , minimum salads , etc . Nothing works for me . <p> Any suggestions you can give me would certainly be appreciated . Believe me  --  finding out that radiation is no longer given to stage I patients does not make me a very happy camper ! Agnes Kermode Cleveland , Ohio <p> <p> We sent your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Indiana University . Dr. Randall explains : <p> " It is fairly common for people receiving external beam pelvic radiation therapy to have some diarrhea during treatment . In the vast majority of patients , this side effect goes away , as it did in your case . It is unusual for it to return as described , although some patients will continue to have certain food intolerances . <p> " The main device is to avoid high-fiber foods because they are hard for the gastrointestinal tract to absorb . This causes the colon to retain more fluid , leading to diarrhea . I would suggest stopping the Metamucil , maintaining a low-fiber diet ( dairy products are usually okay ) , avoiding an osmotic load ( e.g. , milkshakes ) and trying some medications to slow down the gastrointestinal tract . Examples of these medications are Lomotil and Immodium . These medications are very safe , even in significant doses , and they can be adjusted to the needs of the patient . It is best to determine the dose that prevents diarrhea , rather than just treating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be added , including Kaopectate and even tincture of opium . <p> " Most patients are able to deal effectively with this problem . As always , it is important to see a physician experienced in the management of the specific problem to be addressed . In the situation presented , I would suggest a radiation oncologist or gastroenterologist . <p> " It is worth pointing out that we do continue to use radiation therapy for some patients with low-stage endometrial cancers , based on prognostic factors predictive of recurrence and the amount of surgical staging information available . However , in many cases ( but not all ) , the radiation is given internally to treat only the upper vagina , avoiding any significant radiation to the bowel . This carries a very low risk of acute and chronic side effects . " Find Body Scan Clinic With Board-Certified Radiologist <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> Thank you for any help you may be able to give . Your article on Dr. Kenneth Cooper 's use of body scans led me to feel that I should arrange to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but closer to home . I would like some more information . My questions are : ( 1 ) How and where can I get lined up for a full body scan and related evaluations and ( 2 ) Have you seen good scientific studies which show that chelation therapy ( EDTA treatment ) is both safe and effective ? Is this true for both oral and intravenous treatment ? <p> Your help would be greatly appreciated . Martha Newlon Wilmington , Delaware <p> <p> Dr. Dale Guyer , an Indianapolis-area physician who utilizes conventional and alternative treatments for his busy practice , provides the following information about chelation therapy : <p> " The opinions on the scientific support for chelation therapy will generally be variable , depending on who you ask . Yes , there are studies done on EDTA chelation therapy for circulatory disorders . Some studies show support and others are equivocal . Efforts are under way to complete a large-scale , multicenter trial to resolve the current uncertainty . <p> " Having given these qualifications , I have seen anecdotally that most patients undergoing chelation therapy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a difference . In addition , most patients with abnormal heart rhythms will improve , and the treatment generally helps stabilize blood pressure . <p> " In my experience , intravenous chelation therapy works best . The oral versions may be helpful when toxic metal levels are low or as follow-up to an IV approach . " <p> Specialized clinics offer full body scans for hidden disease . Some are affiliated with major medical centers . We 're sure you will investigate the facility to make certain it is staffed by a board-certified radiologist who will consult with your doctor , if needed .

Why in some eating places more than others ? After two years of trial and elimination , I found the culprit-black pepper ( especially coarsely ground ) . I also have a slight aversion to dill and some vinegars . <p> Tell Dorothy Downard of Azusa , California , to abstain from these seasonings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have no problems when I omit these from my diet . Shirley B. Jacobs Laomi , Illinois <p> <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I saw Dorothy Downard 's letter in the March/April 2004 issue . My daughter ( in her 50s ) had an onslaught of flatulence , and after determining everything was okay per colonscopy , she started eating yogurt with live cultures and acidophilus . These ingredients are on the label . Not all yogurt has " live " written on labels , so check carefully . This corrected her situation immediately , and she maintains a healthy digestive system if she does her part . I , too , had flatulence and loose stools , but not diarrhea , so I did the following , which has been successful : Reduce roughage intake ( I love salads , so that hurt ) Eat the above yogurt Add some all-bran to my oatmeal or whatever <p> I also take Naturade Stomach Formula , which is concentrated aloe  --  available at health-food stores . Esther Howell Lake City , Florida <p> Relief From Nightly Leg Cramps <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning nightly leg cramps . I suffered with this amazing recurrence , until I began evaluating my bedtime habits .

Available in supplements , lutein is also found in dark green leafy vegetables , egg yolks , and red or yellow vegetables and fruits . <p> Those with a family history of glaucoma need to insist that their ophthalmologists check their optic nerves frequently to detect any signs of damage , or they may later find that they have suffered some irreversible optic nerve loss while the pressure in their eye remained within normal limits . For decades , screening for glaucoma depended on the discovery of elevated intraocular pressure . However , it is now known that some patients with glaucoma have normal eye pressures ( a condition called normal-tension glaucoma or NTG ) and elude diagnosis during routine eye exams . <p> Many different eye drops can help slow and even prevent vision loss due to glaucoma .
