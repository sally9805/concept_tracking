. Nathan Myhrvold is arguably the most influential inventor in America . So how come he does n't actually make anything ? . ? NATHAN MYHRVOLD , former chief technology officer for Microsoft , onetime post-doctoral fellow under Stephen Hawking , fly-fishing fanatic and paleontology buff , left Bill Gates 's fold in 1999 with a nine-figure nest egg . That might explain his shopping sprees for antique microscopes , supercomputers , slide rules and other classic inventions . And now he 's collecting ideas . The 47-year-old Renaissance man has been snapping up thousands of patents from inventors who do n't have the resources to bring their innovations to market . Even more tantalizing is his collection of all-star inventors whom he regularly taps for ideas . His monthly brainstorming sessions have already produced some 500 patent applications for Myhrvold 's Intellectual Ventures . Though not as prolific as , say , IBM , Myhrvold is already a major force in the field of invention . And he 's only just begun . Q : You say invention is broken . Why ? A : The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19th century , we had inventors like Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla whose only output would be inventions . The U.S. census actually had a job classification called " inventor " until 1940 Now most companies have R &D; departments with a little " r " and a big " d . " Only a tiny effort is about inventing something really new . But invention is different than either research or development . Q : How so ? A : Unlike a development engineer , Intellectual Ventures is not trying to create any specific product in a specific period of time . A typical researcher might work their whole career on one problem , and if they 're successful , they 'll make a little bit of progress . A development engineer , from the other perspective , wants to make a product , usually within a few years . This might make you rich with stock options , but it 's a mistake to place all your efforts on short-term things . Q : You 've tapped some of the world 's biggest inventors  --  people like biotechnologist Leroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas . Why would n't an inventor just go it alone ? A : Most inventors know how difficult the process is and how expensive it is to get patents . The reason they have a relationship with us is that without a way to capture their ideas , most of their best ideas will go nowhere . Some of our inventors , like Dr. Hood , are superstars , and they do n't really need us . But it is both fun and more productive for them to work with us . We can increase the productivity of even the most productive inventors . An all-day session with five or 10 people can generate 50 to 100 ideas . We generate ideas faster than we know what to do with them . Q : So you lock a bunch of geniuses in a room together and see what happens ? A : A diverse group of smart people can come up with a solution that no one of them could have on their own  --  each one has a piece of the puzzle . That 's one area where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of medical-device companies and engineers and physicists . It 's less common that you get the medical guy , the engineer and the physicist in the same room . Normally , the only time a surgeon sees a physicist or computer scientist is if he 's cutting one open . Q : What sorts of inventions are you working on ? A : We have a patent on microlenses for digital cameras that could allow you to have cameras that were the size of a pin and cost a penny . We 've got patents on ways to make vaccines faster and for limited-use e-mail accounts , which are handy if you want to do things anonymously . And in solid-state physics , we have a patent on a way to focus light that could be used for making silicon chips , even invisibility cloaks see " Unveiling the First Invisibility Shield , " page 80 . We 're not nuts enough to think we have the cloaking device from Star Trek , but there are things you can do in that direction . Q : Could all those patents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop people from making our inventions . If people do n't make them , we do n't get paid . Yes , we 'll charge reasonable royalties for the use of them , and if our fees are n't reasonable , people wo n't pay them . I think that if inventors had more financial leverage , we would get more inventions . Q : Should the average garage tinkerer approach you ? A : Garage inventors do approach us , and most of the time , it does n't work out because we 're not a patent-law firm that says , " You tell us the invention , and we 'll do it . " Our core fields are solid-state physics , electronics , computing , biotechnology and medical devices . I 'm a sucker for mechanical inventions  --  my kitchen is full of every gadget anyone has ever invented , and when I go fly-fishing , I 've got every damn fly-fishing gadget known to man . But that 's not what we focus on . PULLQUOTE " The world does n't focus enough attention on invention . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicist or computer scientist is if he 's cutting one open .
