<p> Alex Rodriguez is now a third baseman . Derek Jeter still is trying to find himself . Nomar Garciaparra is stuck on the disabled list . <p> It used to be that the most interesting American League infielders worked at shortstop . These days , second base deserves most of the spotlight . <p> Here 's a look at three unheralded second basemen worth watching : <p> Ronnie Belliard , Indians : He has n't made fans in Cleveland forget about Roberto Alomar , but his .371 batting average entering Saturday is hard to ignore . <p> But check out where Belliard spends much of his time . That would be him in shallow right field , looking more like a rover out of a softball game than a major-league second baseman . <p> Against certain hitters , Belliard prefers to play a few steps back on the grass . He recently snagged a line drive to right by the Baltimore Orioles ' Rafael Palmeiro that would have dropped for a two-run single with anyone else playing second . <p> I do n't agree with it wholeheartedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's positioning , " but there 's a lot of things infielders do that I do n't agree with . <p> " Ronnie is comfortable with it , and he 's made all the plays there . " <p> Orlando Hudson , Blue Jays : In only his second time batting leadoff in the majors since 2002 , Hudson put a claim on the job Thursday , getting four hits and scoring a career-high five runs against the Boston Red Sox . <p> Hudson helped send Curt Schilling to his shortest outing this season  --  five innings . <p> A switch hitter , Hudson struggled last season from the right side , batting .162 . But he entered the game against Schilling with a .273 average right-handed . <p> " I batted leadoff every day in Triple-A , " Hudson said . " But I 'm still learning at this level . I 've only got a year and a half in . I still have a whole lot to learn . " <p> Willie Harris , White Sox : In danger of losing his job to super-sub Juan Uribe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . <p> He entered Saturday 's game hitting .308 , giving manager Ozzie Guillen more confidence in his leadoff hitter . To keep Uribe and Harris in the lineup now that Jose Valentin is off the disabled list , Guillen considered moving Harris to center field , where he made 23 starts last season . <p> " A lot of people told me Willie 's a pretty good outfielder , " Guillen said . " But the way he 's playing second base , the way he 's swinging the bat , I do n't want to do something different and play with this kid 's mind . " <p> LEADING OFF <p> " It 's a lot of money to come out to a ballgame . And lately it 's probably better spent going to the movies than coming to watch the Diamondbacks . " <p> Randy Johnson , Diamondbacks pitcher , on the disappointing start by his team , which has scored one run in his last two starts <p> ROUNDING THE BASES <p> MANNY HAPPY RETURNS : Manny Ramirez could have been sore at the Boston Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to dump their talented hitter and his hefty contract . He could have been bitter about a failed trade to the Texas Rangers for Alex Rodriguez . <p> Instead , he has put on the happiest face he has shown during a 12-year career . <p> With Nomar Garciaparra on the disabled list and Pedro Martinez generally grumpy , Ramirez has become a fan favorite at Fenway Park . He 's loving every second of it and still does n't hold any bitter feelings toward the Red Sox , even if they did n't seem to want him around . <p> " I definitely want to finish in Boston , " Ramirez said . " This is the place to be . If you 're going to win a World Series , this is the place to do it . Not New York , not Miami , that 's nothing . The big thing is winning here , and we 've got the pieces to do it . " <p> ROCKET RAVES : Houston Astros ace Roger Clemens guns for an 8-0 start today as he faces the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next three games , Clemens , who is 317-160 , will have twice as many victories as losses in his career . The only other 300-game winner to do that was Lefty Grove , who was 300-141 . <p> The New York Yankees , who sent Clemens into retirement last fall , are not bitter about his unretirement . Catcher Jorge Posada says he keeps in touch with Clemens through e-mail . <p> " I 'm not surprised he 's doing well , but 7-0 is surprising , " Posada said . " Maybe I 'll bat against him at the All-Star Game in Houston . " <p> How about a World Series showdown , with a return to the Bronx ? <p> " If that happened , " slugger Jason Giambi said , " I 'd have to tip my cap to him when I get in the box . " <p> ANTONIO WHO ? A surprising name was the Atlanta Braves ' leader in victories entering the weekend . Antonio Alfonseca , the former Cubs reliever whom fans at Wrigley Field hated to see trotting out of the bullpen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the weekend having pitched 72/3 consecutive scoreless innings out of the Braves ' bullpen . <p> In two of those victories , including one Thursday against the St. Louis Cardinals , Alfonseca earned the decision after getting only two outs in the middle innings . <p> BOWA BY THE NUMBERS : Philadelphia Phillies manager Larry Bowa got tossed Thursday for arguing balls and strikes with plate umpire Ted Barrett . Nothing new there , except the real reason for the thumb , according to Bowa . <p> " I said , ' The ball is low . Come on , bear down , ' " Bowa said . " He said , ' You 're gone . ' I said , ' What is this all about ? ' He said , ' I 'm tired of taking your expletive from last year . ' I said , ' Last year ? ' He brought up last year . I 've never heard an umpire bring up last year . Never . Ever . ... I never even heard it in Little League . It 's not professional , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> According to the Elias Sports Bureau , that made 46 career ejections for Bowa . The breakdown : 23 as a manager ( 19 with Phillies ) , 17 as a player and six as a coach . <p> BIG-LEAGUE BUZZ <p> *The Red Sox , who are paying pitcher Byung-Hyun Kim a combined $10 million for this season and next , will have him start the first two innings of games every third day at Class AAA Pawtucket . " The most important thing right now is that he regain his command and the explosiveness of his pitches , " Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein said . " We 're not giving up on him . " <p> *How do you explain the sizzling start of Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre , who is a free agent after this season ? " He 's a high-fastball hitter , and everybody is throwing him high fastballs , " an American League team executive said . " Last year , everybody threw him nothing but offspeed pitches , and he could n't do anything with them a .240 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sr. , on the hot start by White Sox infielder Juan Uribe , one of Alomar 's former projects in Colorado : " He is a great talent . But every time I talked to him last year , his mind was on his contract . The effort was always there , but his focus was n't where it should have been . He put too much pressure on himself . But he 's one of the best talent-wise . I love him . Sometimes he was misunderstood . " <p> *Aaron Boone , who was released by the Yankees before the season , continues to rehab his injured left knee and expects to be available by late July or early August . Boone , 31 , says he has talked to 15 teams about signing a free-agent contract , and he 's open to playing third base or second base . <p> Numbers game <p> Astros ace Roger Clemens is the first pitcher in 42 years to win his first seven starts for a team he did n't pitch for the previous season . If Clemens wins today , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco Giants in 1962 , the season after he ended a 13-year run with the White Sox . <p> Wilson Alvarez <p> Los Angeles Dodgers <p> Some of his teammates wondered what took so long , but Wilson Alvarez finally has secured a spot in the Dodgers ' rotation . <p> Moved from the bullpen to make two spot starts for a struggling Jose Lima , the former White Sox left-hander showed manager Jim Tracy he belongs as a starter . <p> A non-roster invitee to spring training in 2003 , Alvarez made 12 starts last season for the Dodgers , and they went 9-3 in those games . He finished the season , used mostly in relief , going 6-2 with a 2.37 ERA . <p> He won six consecutive decisions as a starter from July 13 to Sept. 23 , compiling a 1.39 ERA during the stretch , but he still opened this season in the bullpen . <p> In his first start this season , he held the Pirates to one hit in seven scoreless innings , striking out five and walking none . He nailed down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hits in 72/3 scoreless innings , striking out eight and walking one . <p> " In spring training , he really deserved to be a starter , " teammate Odalis Perez said . " He 's one of the guys who , when he 's out there , he 's tough . " <p> Said Lima : " I hope he does well and helps this team win a championship . Now I 'll come out of the bullpen as a long reliever and do my job . No complaints . "
