Thanks to my forefathers , I knew exactly what kind of dad I did n't want to be . So why is the prospect of becoming a good father so intimidating ? BY BRUCE KLUGER Photograph FATHER SUPERIOR : The author , age 8 ( seated ) , with brothers and father . // THE MOST VIVID memory I have of my father is of his fist , punching through a door to gain entry into our house . But I never actually saw this . It was 1961 , I 'd just turned 5 , and my parents were in the first stormy throes of their divorce . Earlier in the day , my oldest brother had accidentally broken one of the glass panes in our kitchen door , which my mother had temporarily patched with a flap from a cardboard box . That night my father came to the house to serve my mother legal papers . Discovering he was locked out , he socked through the makeshift windowpane , let himself into the kitchen , then charged up the stairs and into my mom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors . The fact that I never really witnessed this incident-I was already in bed-yet to this day can easily summon up a mental picture of it has always bewildered me . What kind of yearning compels a little boy , and then a man , to conjure images of domestic havoc he was lucky to escape in the first place ? Why not leave well enough alone ? Perhaps it 's because traditional mementos of childhood tend to be empty . Scrapbooks selectively browse through the past , cherry-picking its proudest moments . Home movies teem with vacant smiles . By comparison , my invented memory ofthat night in the kitchen is exciting and disturbing and passionate . It 's something worth hanging onto . I suppose the other reason I cling to the picture of my father 's late-night break-in is because it 's one of the few memories in which I do n't have to share him . Within two years , my parents would be divorced , and dad would sulk off to another city to begin a new family , one that my brothers and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT AND TEN CENTS will get you on the subway . " According to family lore , these were the words that my father 's father , David , spoke to him on the day he graduated from business school in 1954 . My grandfather , a self-made tycoon who had once enjoyed a bit of fame for loaning Israel a million dollars , had just liquidated the family business-this at the very moment my father , diploma in hand , was expecting to join it . Although my grandfather 's decision probably made some sort of business sense , it stunned my dad , shattering any dreams he may have harbored about someday succeeding his father as the family patriarch . In my more charitable moments , I can forgive my grandfather his selfishness . His awkward chilliness toward his son was not uncommon in an era in which men concentrated on commanding households as opposed to living in them . Yet other times I ca n't help but wonder how my own life would have been different had this man been as creative a grandfather as he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grandfather giving me as a child was a reel-to-reel Wollensak tape recorder for my Bar Mitzvah . I loved it , of course , and used it for years . But it was n't until I was a father myself that I became aware of the other gifts my grandfather could have bestowed . His cavernous apartment , for instance , overlooked the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day parade route . Imagine the raw adoration and wonder he could have engendered in four small boys-ages 5 , 6 , 7 and 9-by hoisting them onto a window seat to watch a giant Mighty Mouse float by . Would n't I still be replaying those memories today ? But we were never invited into my grandfather 's home . He was worried we 'd make a mess . I never liked my " Poppa " David , but I do n't want to forget him . As an adult , I remain mindful of his example , just as a driver keeps the side of the road in his peripheral vision-conscious of its presence , careful to steer clear . David died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Wollensak . IT WAS ONE of those moments I actually caught on film . Walking into my apartment to meet my new baby girl-his first grandchild-in 1995 , my father-in-law , Terry , headed straight for the cradle . Lifting Bridgette out and holding her up in front of him , like an art curator inspecting a precious vase , Terry smiled wistfully . I quickly snapped a photo of this first encounter , but it was n't until the film came hack that I noticed the softness in his eyes . I had never seen this type of gentleness on a man 's face , and it left me breathless . Photograph DAD , RESIGNED : The author in 1999 , with daughters Bridgette and Audrey // As he does with his own three daughters , Terry expresses real interest in almost everything about me-from my work to my passion for baseball . And yet I have always had trouble accepting his kindness . Having never experienced this sort of affection from a man , I reflexively distrust it , convinced it will evaporate if I reach out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , had always been one of longing , not love . All of this was new to me . I 'll never forget the vacation to the Outer Banks I once took with my in-laws . I broke my leg in a jet-ski accident , and shortly afterward Terry sank into a funk . Worried , I asked my wife if he was angry with me . " No , " said Alene , " he 's mad at himself for not protecting you . " I did n't understand . Such a concept-fatherly love without a price-simply did n't register . All of which left me wondering : How common were men like Terry when I was a child ? Moreover , would my own father be a different kind of dad if he were my age today ? This , I suppose , is the practical joke of contemporary parenting for many of us . We try to give to our own children that which we were never given in the first place . We hold fast to our commitment to be better dads than our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip beneath the tug of self-doubt . I often like to say that while my father taught me what kind of dad I did n't want to be , my father-in-law has shown me what is truly possible . But I continue to worry . Like a music critic who can recognize a brilliant melody but is unable to play an instrument himself , I question whether I 'll ever be able to match Terry 's virtuosity as a father . TEN DAYS AFTER Bridgette was born , my wife awakened me early in the morning to tell me that my dad had died . He 'd been ill for a while , and the call came while I was sleeping . My reaction to the news was instant : I wanted to hold our infant daughter . My father had never met Bridgette , and yet I felt compelled to have her close to me-pressing my lips against her hair and feeling the rise and fall of her small chest as Alene explained the details of Dad 's passing . Why did I need to cradle my daughter in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close ? What was it about those images of the three fathers who preceded me-a clenched fist , a cold shoulder , a compassionate gaze-that led me to select this particular tableau as my own self-portrait ? The answer would come four years later , as I again held Bridgette close , this time as we gazed at the sky on a warm summer night . " see that star ? " said Bridgette , pointing to the brightest pinpoint of light . " That 's Grandpa . I can find him every time . " Apparently my daughter had picked up the one magic trick I 'd learned from my own childhood : the ability to close the distance between what we have and what we wish for . By finding the grandfather she had never met , shining brightly in the dark sky , Bridgette reminded me that it 's okay to reach beyond reality for a glimmer of hope . That mistakes are n't the worst thing that can happen . That , no matter the era , parenting will always be a bumpy journey . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .
