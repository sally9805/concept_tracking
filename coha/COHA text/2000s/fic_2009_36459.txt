BOISE CITY , SEPTEMBER 1883 <p> It was mid-afternoon when Gavin Blake drove the wagon down Boise City 's Main Street . The territorial capital had grown in the years since his last visit . There had to be several good physicians living here these days . One of them would be able to help Drucilla . If he did n't believe that , he never would have agreed to undertake this trip . <p> He turned toward his wife . A tall and plain woman , her kind and giving spirit more than made up for whatever outward beauty she lacked . Everyone who knew Dru loved her . Which only made it harder on Gavin , seeing her as she was now - too thin , too frail , exhaustion from a week of travel written in her hazel eyes . <p> I should n't have let her come . <p> Not that she 'd given him much choice . Dru 's will had n't weakened along with her body . It was still hard as flint . <p> At least the weather had been warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed in the back of the wagon so she could rest whenever she wanted , and at night they 'd lain beneath the blankets , staring at the stars and talking about what Dru wanted for Sabrina and Petula . Sometimes listening to her - hearing the calm acceptance in her voice - made him angry . He wanted to rail against her illness - and against God for letting her get sick in the first place . Had n't she suffered enough ? <p> Gavin stopped the wagon in front of the Overland Hotel . After setting the brake , he hopped to the ground . <p> " Come on . " He held his arms toward her . " Let 's get you into a nice , soft bed . " <p> " Should n't we go to the newspaper office first ? " <p> " I 'll take care of that later . " <p> " Gavin , I - " <p> " You heard me . Come on . " <p> Dru acquiesced with a nod . " I suppose you 're right , but we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we came . " His tone was gruff , though he did n't mean for it to be . He was n't angry at her . <p> It never failed to alarm him when he lifted her down from the wagon and his fingers overlapped around her waist . He remembered when she was pregnant , her body ripe and round like a pumpkin , her face rosy , her eyes shining with happiness . That seemed a lifetime ago . Look at what had happened in the few years since then . First her son was stillborn , then Charlie died , and now this . If only he could take her back East to one of those fine hospitals . If only he were wealthy . If only there was more he could do for her . <p> " Gavin ? " Her cool fingers touched his cheek . " Let 's go inside . " <p> Without a word , he placed a solicitous arm around her back and guided her into the lobby of the hotel . <p> * * * <p> Wanted : Governess and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living quarters . Apply Mrs. Blake , Overland Hotel , after 2:00 PM Friday . <p> Emily set down the newspaper and stared out the window at the tall poplars , cottonwoods , and willows growing alongside the river . A warm breeze lifted wisps of hair across her forehead and caressed her skin with the last breath of summer . A large blowfly buzzed beneath the porch awning , bumping into the window , then flying away before returning to try again . <p> Perhaps the insect seemed noisy because the house was so silent . Kevin , Colleen , Tara Maureen , and Colin - Maggie 's four oldest children - were all in school . Sheridan , at four the baby of the family , had gone into town with his mother for some shopping . And Emily was here alone with time weighing heavy on her mind . <p> She left the dining room and wandered into the parlor . There , her fingers caressed the photographs and knickknacks as she moved about the room . Memories . Lots of memories . Happy ones too . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless and impatient with her life . Nothing seemed to be going as she wanted . <p> Not that she was entirely sure what that entailed . What did she want ? <p> For many weeks after her hasty return last winter from Washington , D.C. , she had gladly cared for her sister and young nephew , nursing them back to health , praying for their recovery , seeing to their every need . She had mothered the older children , reassuring them that all would be well . And she 'd spent many a late evening sitting with Tucker in this very room , offering her brother-in-law what comfort she could . <p> But the Branigan household had long since returned to normal . Although wanted , she knew , Emily was n't needed any longer . <p> Should she return to Washington ? Despite how much she had enjoyed her work , that option no longer felt right . But what awaited her here ? Marriage ? A family of her own ? She did n't feel ready for those things yet . In fact , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . <p> No , she wanted to do something before she married . She wanted to make some sort of difference in the world . If only she knew what . <p> She shook her head and walked back toward the dining room , pausing by the window and staring across the yard toward the river . Bed sheets fluttered in the golden September sunlight . Tucker 's old collie lay in the shade of a poplar , his tail slapping the dried grass in a lazy , steady rhythm . <p> God , what is it I 'm to do ? I 'll die of boredom if you do n't show me something soon . <p> She sighed as she turned from the window . Her gaze fell upon the folded newspaper , lying on the oak table where she 'd left it moments ago . <p> Look at it , her heart seemed to say . <p> She took up the paper and read the ad a second time . <p> Wanted : Governess and teacher for two young girls on mountain ranch . Separate living quarters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday . <p> Her pulse quickened . This could be it . This was something she could do . She 'd lived on a ranch since she was six , so that prospect did n't daunt her . Cattle and horses and cowhands were a part of her history . <p> She certainly knew how to teach . She 'd received a wonderful education and had countless things she could share with two young girls . And after living all these years with Maggie 's brood , she knew a thing or two about acting like a governess to children , even if she 'd never been employed as one . <p> Yes , this was something she could do . She was sure of it . <p> Did she dare apply for the job ? <p> * * * <p> Drucilla Blake awakened slowly from her nap . On days like this , when she felt no pain , it was hard to believe she was dying . Tired , yes . Dying , no . <p> She pushed herself up on the pillows , then swept her hair back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bodice of her dress , 1:15 . She would have to get up if she was to meet people at two o'clock . <p> A cold feeling engulfed her chest , and she closed her eyes , her fingers still clutching the watch . What if no one came ? Or what if they came and no one was right ? It was important to find the right woman . Not just for Sabrina and Petula , but for Gavin too . <p> It was n't right what she 'd done to him . When that old sawbones told her she was dying , she should have left the ranch . She should have taken the children and gone . But to where ? She had no other family , no way to support herself . What would have happened to Sabrina and Petula if she 'd left the basin and taken them to a strange place ? No , she 'd had to stay . The Idaho mountains were where she would end her days , where she would be buried beside Charlie and her stillborn son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then straightened and lowered her legs over the side of the bed . There was no time to feel sorry for herself . She had come to terms with her illness months ago . Gavin would love and care for the children . He was that sort of man . She had only this one last detail to attend to , and then she would be able to die in peace . <p> She rose from the bed and walked toward the bureau , glancing into the mirror as she picked up the hairbrush . That was a mistake . Her reflection depressed her . She looked far older than her thirty-five years . Her illness had taken its toll , turning her brown hair gray and leaving her eyes dull and lifeless . <p> Lowering her gaze , she tidied her hair and smoothed her dress with the flat of her hands , then left the bedroom . <p> In the small sitting room , Gavin stood at the window , gazing down at the busy street below . Dru paused a moment to look at him . His black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of trimming . She should have seen to that before they left the basin . <p> He must have heard something , for he turned to face her . " Did you sleep ? " <p> She nodded . <p> " Are you hungry ? " <p> " No . I do n't think I could eat anything . " <p> " You barely touched your breakfast . " It was a tender admonishment . <p> She shook her head and turned toward the nearby sofa . She hated to see that look in his eyes . It made her feel guilty for all she had put him through , all she had yet to put him through . <p> " I wonder what the girls are doing this afternoon , " Gavin said . <p> She understood the motive behind his words . He wanted to cheer her with thoughts of the children . She loved him for it . <p> " Probably out riding with Stubs , " he continued . " The boys ought to have the cows rounded up by the time we get back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the summer range so soon . " Dru imagined the majestic peaks of the rugged Sawtooth Mountains and the log house that lay in their shadows . No one needed to tell her she would n't see another spring in the Stanley Basin . <p> Her husband came to sit beside her . " Dru , I want you to see the doctor before we leave Boise . " <p> She offered a faint smile . " Do n't , Gavin . We both know it wo n't make any difference . " <p> Before he could contradict her , they were interrupted by a knock . Dru 's gaze snapped toward the door . <p> " They 're early , " she whispered . <p> Dear God , please bring us the right woman . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
