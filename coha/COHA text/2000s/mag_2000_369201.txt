Throughout the past century humanity did everything in its power to dominate nature . We dammed earth 's rivers , chopped down the forests and depleted the soils . Burning up fossil fuels that had been created over eons , we pumped billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the air , altering atmospheric chemistry and appreciably warming the planet in just a few decades . And as our population began the year 2000 above the 6 billion mark , still spreading across the continents , dozens of animal and plant species were going extinct every day , including the first primate to disappear in more than 100 years , Miss Waldron 's red colobus . <P> At the start of the 21st century there were unmistakable signs that exploitation of the planet was reaching its limit  --  that nature was beginning to take its revenge . Melting ice in the polar regions suggested that the climate was changing rapidly . Weather was even more erratic than usual , giving some places too little rain and others too much . Fires raced across the parched American West last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwan . No specific event could be directly blamed on global warming , but scientists say that in a greenhouse world , deluges and droughts will be more frequent  --  and severe . Already the hotter climate has increased the range of tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever . Other ominous signals from an overburdened planet include falling grain and fish harvests and fiercer competition for scarce water supplies . <P> But there were also , in the year 2000 , signs of greater awareness . Linked by the Internet , hundreds of millions of people rallied for the cause of conservation on the 30th anniversary of Earth Day . Governments from Washington to Lima took steps to protect large wilderness areas from development . Progress was made toward using more renewable energy from the wind and the sun , and new hybrid cars that used both gasoline and electricity sported impressive fuel-economy statistics . <P> The goal for the new century is " sustainable development " : continued economic growth without environmental destruction . Is that possible ? It depends on how well we understand that humanity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Charles P. Alexander <P> Rising Waters <P> From Mozambique to Miami , people faced flooding of biblical depths . In Africa in February , two weeks of heavy rain were followed by the fury of Cyclone Eline . With it , land near the Limposo River was swamped ; by early March at least 200 Mozambicans had died , a million were homeless and 10,000 remained stranded in trees or on rooftops . In the fall of 1999 Hurricane Floyd dealt Florida and the Southeast a glancing blow that left people bailing ; the rains of autumn 2000 left the same folks wondering if inundation was to be an annual ritual . In Miami in October , Hulda Stern , 93 , who lived on her own with her cat Pinky , refused to leave the house in which she had lived since 1945 . Some scientists warned that global warming would make the tropical storms of the future ever more intense , destructive and lethal .
