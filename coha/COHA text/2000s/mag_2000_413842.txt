JUST BROWSING ? Accessories heaven at Gucci 's newly revamped Fifth Avenue flagship . of Herme 's new home on Madison Avenue . // WHAT 'S YOUR SHOPPING STYLE ? WHETHER IT 'S PAGING THE GUCCI STORE MANAGER IN TOKYO TO FIND YOUR SIZE IN TOM FORD 'S PURPLE SATIN CARGO PANTS OR SENDING THE PRADA SALESPERSON CHAMPAGNE WHEN SHE LANDS SPRING 'S CONE-HEELED STILETTO , SHOPPING CAN BE AN ALL-CONSUMING-AND CHARACTER-DEFINING  --  PASSION . BAZAAR HIT THE STREETS AND DISCOVERED FOUR TYPES OF SHOPPERS WHO KNOW HOW TO GET EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT . PHOTOGRAPHED BY JOEL MEYEROWITZ The Shopaholic Sally Hershberger approaches shopping with the zeal of a cheerleader and the diligence of an army commander . As hairstylist to stars from Meg Ryan to Courtney Love , Hershberger has been known to launch full-scale shopping offensives . In Paris recently , she scooped up two coats  --  one leather , one shearling  --  from Gucci and a chocolate  --  colored raincoat from Louis Vuitton , while across town at Colette , assistants scoured the stock before her arrival . Then , after dashing to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vintage  --  inspired , as well as scarves , hats , and a sweater for her dog , Cherry , who feels the cold . Back in New York , she felt satisfied-until a friend invited her to Comme des Garcons , where she chanced upon another coat made from two separate coats zipped together . " It 's two for the price of one , " she reasoned . Of course it is . Hershberger is part of a new breed of shopaholics who are taking the fashion fix to never-before-seen extremes . Their shopping strategies : devouring designer labels in volume , hunting in packs , and winging around the globe in search of select pieces . Their boiling point : nonexistent . The first telltale sign of a shopaholic is buying in bulk . At Emma Gold on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles , the item of choice is a customized Matilde sweater . Reese Witherspoon recently bought nine , and Mariah Carey insisted on 11 different versions to add to the 14 her stylist had already procured for her . Emboldened by her role in Charlie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire Chloe collection at Fred Segal like targets at a firing range . An equally revealing symptom of the shopping-obsessed is frequency . Gwyneth Paltrow is a regular face at so many upscale New York boutiquesPrada , Gucci , Jeffrey , you name it-that practically an entire Internet site has been dedicated to Gwyneth-spotting . Like an insatiable curator , the shopaholic is endlessly adding to her collection . At Sol-lo 's Kirna Zab &e,; Liv Tyler was so enamored of London designer Jo Gordon 's accessories that she bought armfuls of hats , gloves , and knee socks . At Diavolina in L.A. , the must-have is Giuseppe Zanotti shoes . Snapping up new models every couple of weeks , Jennifer Lopez could mount her own Zanotti retrospective . Maggie Rizer has been known to drop thousands of dollars on a pair of crocodile-skin Manolo Blahniks , while Jimmy Choo stilettos are gobbled up on both coasts : In New York , Alexandra von Furstenberg nabbed six pairs at once ; in L.A. , Jennifer Tilly took home 12 . For others , it 's the vintage bug that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles of Pucci , Winona Ryder goes mad for Gucci bags , and Gina Gershon falls apart at the sight of Courreges and Pierre Cardin . Kimora Lee Simmons is another with sybaritic leanings . " I buy things in every color , every fabric , every weight-the same item , " says the designer and wife of music mogul Russell Simmons . " I have the same cashmere sweater in lavender , eggplant , canary , fuchsia , and in a turtleneck , mockneck , and V-neck . And it 's all in my closet , lined up and color coded . That 's obsessive . " " You ca n't buy just one , " attests LaTonya Blige DaCosta , sister and comanager of R &B; singer Mary J. Blige . The Blige women are inclined to tear through malls like a soul train careening off its rails . " The last time we killed it was in a mall in Dallas , " says Blige DaCosta . In one outing the pair picked up Gucci boots , Christian Dior scarves , and Louis Vuitton luggage . Makeup artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want to see just three shops . I 've got to see it all-Barneys , Bergdorf Goodman , up and down Madison Avenue . And Jeffrey , downtown , for shoes-Dolce , Prada , Versace . Shoes are a big problem for me . " When the shopaholic feels the need for a fix , neither money nor travel is an impediment . South Carolina natives Nikki Cantey , a lawyer , and her mother , Gwen Paul , think nothing of making the three-hour pilgrimage to the Jeffrey store in Atlanta to herald the arrival of the new Jil Sander collection . " Believe it or not , it 's picked over within three days , " says Cantey . And for Kathy Nelson , president of music for Buena Vista Motion Picture Group in Los Angeles , no sound is as sweet as that of a Maxfield representative on the phone informing her of new arrivals from Prada , Gucci , and Jean Paul Gaultier . Nelson prefers to blitz it . " I can spend $7000 in a day there , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're all Photograph IT 'S IN THE BAG CLockwise from top Left : Famous shoppers Meg Ryan , Uma Thurman ( with daughter Maya Ray ) , Cameron Diaz , Winona Ryder , and Jennifer Aniston. // out . " Comedian and actress Tracey Ullman , who cofounded the shopping site purpleskirt.com , considers herself a recovering addict , and , she admits , there are times when the dormant longings return . At the London Prada store , she was told they were out of her much-desired Mary Janes . She had a meltdown . " I felt the addiction come back . Some things can send me into a frenzy . " - George Epaminondas The Winner On a busy afternoon in London , Cynthia Gabay walked into Harrods and fell for a pair of deep-brown velvet pants by Chloe . She could n't locate her size on the rack , so she kindly asked the sales assistant to find her a pair in the stockroom . " Sorry , I do n't think I can sell you that , " replied the assistant . " They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to sell it to me because the stock had just arrived . " Gabay wasted no time . She pulled out her mobile phone , flipped open her Palm , clicked on " Shops , " and dialed the Chloe stores in Paris and New York . " I did n't scream ; I just called around , right there in front of her , which gave her more time to reflect , " recalls Gabay . Paris and New York had sold out of the pants , but in the meantime , the Harrods assistant realized Gabay meant business . She called her manager , and moments later Gabay walked out with her favorite Chloe pants . " I 'm a trained shopper , " says Gabay . " If I want something , I want that thing . " Many of New York 's fashion  --  forward socialites , who reinvent their image with each new season , race to secure their favorite items first With so few high-end pieces in each collection , competition is fierce . " I do my shopping early , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stylist friend . " I go into Saks the minute the new arrivals come in . " Others , like Johnson 's friend Elisabeth Kieselstein-Cord , are exasperated with the process : " I shudder when I see more than two people wearing what I have at a party , " she says . " I used to put my name on waitlists , but I lost patience . " Some determined shoppers have taken to fighting-or fibbing-their way to the top of a waitlist . Calling relentlessly to check on their orders , pretending to be best friends with " Michael " ( Kors ) , and namedropping famous clients are a few of the shameless methods commonly employed . " It 's not very fun to be on a waitlist , " says actress Lisa Marie , a regular front-row celebrity at Marc Jacobs 's shows . " Shopping should be graceful and a good experience . " Actress Milla Jovovich agrees : " You 've got to be good to people and give them love , " she says of designers and their salespeople . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoppers like Gabay , Johnson , and Jovovich understand that waving money around wo n't ensure you that perfect $3000 Pr-ada coat . Navigating a market of high demand and low supply requires charm , resourcefulness , and the occasional dinner invitation . Photograph PURCHASING POWER Cynthia Gabay ( above takes a closer Look at Hermes in New York . // BUYING TIME A BRIEF HISTORY OF SHOPPING // Bypassing the waitlist is an art Gabay has finessed to perfection . For luxury items , such as the Hermes Birkin bag , she places her order with a shop owner she knows in Germany . If London does n't have her Gucci shoes , she 'll call Milan . If Gabay 's trapped in Gstaad and dying for Ralph Lauren 's adorable new sweater , she 'll dial New York and have them track it down for her . When Gabay does come through New York , she makes a point of visiting and thanking those people who helped her along the way . " You can walk into one of these stores with all the money in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you 're on your own . I never treat these people like salespeople , because they are so nice . I 'll tell them about a new restaurant or invite one for dinner . This girl who I love at Joseph was having a hard time , so I bought her a little present . I treat them as though they were my best friends . " And they treat her like royalty . Edward O'Sullivan , a personal shopper at Prada in New York who handles Jennifer Lopez , Madonna , and Hilary Swank , has worked with Gabay for years . " She 's not a client ; she 's a friend , " he says . " At the end of the day , it 's all about your charm . If Cynthia wants a special piece , I 'll find it for her whether it 's in London or South America . " " When you want something , " says Gabay , " go for it ! Be bold . And if you do n't find it immediately , do n't give up-just start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfectionist Amanda Cutter drapes her five-nine , blue-eyed self on a love seat in what was once the living room in the kind of old West Side Manhattan apartment where you might have taken piano lessons . Now it 's the studio of Tuleh , the label launched by fashion designers Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley . Polaroids of models dressed in bright Tuleh getups are taped to one wall . Outfits hang from rolling racks . The spring show is only days away , but Patner and Bradley calmly listen like indulgent uncles as Cutter recounts the story of the historic moment when these detail  --  obsessed designers met the perfectionist shopper . Cutter , creative director at Hogan shoes and bags , was given an enormous black Tuleh gown that she wore for a magazine shoot . " It was on my couch for weeks , because it did n't fit in my closet , " she explains . Patner breaks in : " We needed it for a trunk show . It was really embarrassing . I called and asked if we could trade it for something she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw their clothes , " Cutter continues , " I could n't believe there was someone who understood my style so much . Now I have 20 Tuleh pieces and wear them a hundred different ways . " Today she 's in a formfitting apple-green crocodile-print chiffon Tuleh blouse with ruffles down the front , a vintage tiny red cashmere sweater with hook-and-eye closure , dark jeans by Bruce , and Hogan leather sneaker  --  shoes . Unfussy , appropriately young ( Cutter is 26 ) , the combination looks accidentally terrific , but only a fashion insider with a trained eye for detail could have pulled it together . It was Cutter 's mother , an interior designer , who taught her to be a stickler for getting the small things right . She also gave her a love for things made just for her-such as sheets monogrammed with her own initials . Photograph LEADER OF THE PACK Posse shopper Jennifer Lope going solo .

At the moment , she likes taking a classic shape and transforming it in blue crocodile . If Cutter is going to a special event , she calls Patner and Bradley and says , " I need a dress ! " She is not , however , just a muse-a beautiful blonde doll Tuleh can dress up . She 's a creative collaborator who brings her own style to the line . For Labor Day , she was invited to a party in Southhampton that Tamara and Matthew Mellon were giving for Jimmy Choo . Cutter found a bolt of peacock-feather silk from the collection three years ago and asked to have it made in a shape from the upcoming collection : a one-shoulder sheath with matching sash that she tied around her neck . Everyone wanted to know where she got the dress . " I had it made by Tuleh , " she replied . Her picture made Women 's Wear Daily . Off the former living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crystal chandelier still hangs askew from a water-spotted ceiling . There are three sewing machines and a cutting table , and beneath the table , bolts and bolts of Tuleh-designed fabric-paydirt for the custom shopper . Cutter : " They used to keep bolts in the bathtub , and you 'd go to the bathroom and say , Oh my God , what 's that ? ' ' " Bradley : " We have a lot of fabric up here that we do n't have enough of to use for the collection . We keep it for someone who comes along , and that someone is often Amanda . " Patner : " Rediscover and reinvent-those are Amanda 's two favorite words . She 's always right , which is- " Bradley : " An irritant . " Patner : Laughs " Ajoy . " " The clothes are just so much fun to wear , " Cutter remarks , admiring the fabric covering on tiny snaps up the side of a skirt . Dresses from some hot new designers , she says , can look lovely from a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are put together . " With Tuleh , even the label is so beautiful , like elegant clothes from the past . " Although many women have clothes made to measure because nothing off-the-rack fits properly , Cutter goes for custom-made because she likes wearing something no one else has . More than that , she does it for the fun of matching her talents with those of Patner and Bradley and coming up with a winner-something that makes everyone stop and ask , " Where did you get that dress ? " - Mary Tannen The Recluse Last summer , I spent a week in Paris with a close friend . We shared a hotel room , ate every meal together , and lounged around the Place des Vosges gossiping and reading books . The one thing we did not do together was shop . Every morning ofter breakfast , we 'd amble along the streets , let our eyes drift past the store windows , and after five minutes or so , say almost in unison , " I 'm going to shop for a while . See ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For hours . We are both reclusive shoppers . In the world of perusing and choosing and trying on and handing over the plastic , we helped each other out by being nowhere in sight . There may be more reclusive shoppers out there than you think . We 're the ones who avoid eye contact with the salespeople , the ones who are happy to tell you the events of the day  --  went to the dry cleaner , to the gym , to lunch-but neglect to mention that we spent $700 at Barneys New York . One woman I know does n't even like to be seen with shopping bags . - 254 // BUYLINE Sidebar GETTING PERSONAL Sidebar Personal shoppers are so efficient . I 've worked with Lori Richards in the Calvin Klein department at Bergdorf Goodman for years .

She was unbelievably progressive . I remember when she took me to Barneys on 17th Street , when there was only half a floor devoted to women 's clothes . She would buy the Japanese designers there , like Comme des Garcons and Issey Miyake . I think some of my fondest memories are of shopping with my mom . You know , there are n't a lot of great Jewish athletes ! It 's not like we went sailing together on the weekends . - Patricia Wexler , M.D. Sidebar SAFETY IN NUMBERS Sidebar Many women prefer going solo , but for others , it takes a village-or at least an entourage-to shop .

" The space has phone and fax hookups ( business does n't stop for shopping ) , a sound system , DVD player , and freeflowing champagne ( Moet Hennessy is Celine 's sister company ) .
