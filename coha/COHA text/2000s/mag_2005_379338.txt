LANCE ARMSTRONG and PRESIDENT BUSH have a lot in common . Both are Texans and avid cyclists with at least a casual interest in politics . The seven-time Tour de France winner and the leader of the free world shared the trail last weekend at Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas . White House press secretary Trent Duffy would n't say whether the pair discussed politics ( Armstrong opposes the Iraq war and wants more spending on cancer research ) , but at the end of a two-hour , 17-mile spin , Bush gave Armstrong , whom he described as " a good rider , " a T shirt and suggested , " Let 's go swimming . " For his next play date , we think the President should try roller hockey with the G-8.
