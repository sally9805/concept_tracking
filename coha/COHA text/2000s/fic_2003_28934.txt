The Orion Protocol Chapter One January 27/Oval Office/the White House " Two months ago , if anybody had said we were gon na catch this in the first hundred days , I 'd have thought they were high . " The fifty-eight-year-old former senator from Colorado and newly elected President of the United States stared out the much-photographed bay window of the Oval Office and into the cut-back winter Rose Garden . " What was it Truman said ? " On the desktop , the blade end of his letter opener , engraved with the presidential seal , tapped out a rhythmic figure from the William Tell Overture known to Americans who came of age in front of three black-and-white channels of network TV as the theme from The Lone Ranger . " Truman , sir ? " From a clubby wing chair , R. Cabot " Bob " Winston , the President 's national security adviser , recognized the galloping little perididdle and made a private note to include it in his memoirs : one of those little human details people liked to read about from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy . " The President clanked the blade into a decorated soup can/pencil holder his youngest daughter once made him for Father 's Day . " Damn it , I know this . " " Ah , January of forty-five . In this room . " Winston sat up minutely straighter , unconsciously signaling the sense of occasion he felt when past presidents were invoked within these walls . The new President rocked in his leather chair . " With Harriman and his whole sleek Ivy League crowd telling poor Harry-the-Haberdasher he had to nuke the Japanese . " " Or not , " Winston said , in a small bow to the Office . " Oh , I think Einstein 's group was the only ' or not . ' " The President 's dry tone glinted off the darker edge of a sense of humor familiar to his campaign staff . " Jesus , what the hell did he say ? " Winston searched his own mental archives . A buttoned-down Skull &; Bones veteran of executive-branch politics , he had experienced an extraordinary tenure , having served at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council in both Bush administrations . His carryover appointment was both an olive branch across the aisle and a gesture of confidence toward Intelligence : a community beleaguered by scandal , Cold War excesses , and spectacular failures , now resurrected and seeking redemption through its mission against global terrorism . Winston , their point man , produced an answer . " Yes . Was n't it , ' How much time do I have ? ' " " No , ' How much time do I get ? ' " the President said , in Harry Truman 's flat twang , savoring the Midwest inflection . " How much time do I get ? " Winston nodded , composed and ramrod straight . Younger White House staffers had observed that he seemed to wear alertness like a mask , as if some hard-bitten mentor from the halls of spookdom had once cautioned him that blinking one 's eyes was a sign of weakness . And , though word was passed down that the President regarded R. Cabot Winston as a symbol of national unity , many still referred to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fair . " Well , I guess that 's my question , too , Bob . " " We 're a few days out from final testing , sir . " " Days . " The President 's surprise was eloquent enough . Winston offered a thin-lipped smile . " With a caveat which I will explain . " As if triggering a pair of explosive bolts , the national security adviser loudly snapped open the bombproof briefcase handcuffed to his left wrist . He then produced a file stamped project orion/potus/eyes only and laid it flat on the Oval Office desk . POTUS used reading glasses to inspect it as Winston explained . " This is the executive order authorizing continuing funding of space shield research and testing . The record enclosed represents decades of development and half a trillion dollars invested , give or take , each phase of publicly funded R &; D supplemented with discretionary monies by presidential EO . The line for your initials has been flagged . " Noting all the previous presidents ' initials displayed in succession , the new Commander in Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Smithsonian . But he 'd have bet his campaign debt that this record would never see the light of day . " I guess Star Wars did n't just fade away when the Wall came down , " he said , leafing through the pages . " Fortunately not , sir . " Classified above top secret , the file in the President 's hands charted the progress of Project Orion from its Cold War roots as part of Reagan 's Strategic Defense Initiative , a.k.a . Star Wars , to its post-911 incarnation as a space-based laser weapons system adroitly repositioned as a shield against rogue terrorist ICBMs . " Ups the ante from a few missiles on the ground in Alaska , does n't it ? " " The photon laser leapfrogs all other missile defense technology , sir . " The President nodded , his apprehensions intact : space-based weapons more than violated America 's post-ABM strategic defense agreements with Russia . And September 11 no longer provided a free pass for whatever the U.S. wanted in the name of national security . " So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented the facts unadorned , like a nice neat hanging . " There 's a hard window for deployment , sir . We have twenty-one days . " " That 's ridiculous . We 're still looking for the johns around here . " " I understand , sir . But geomechanically , if we do n't deploy Orion within three weeks , NASA says we 'll have to wait a full year before we can try it again , which would be extremely problematic in terms of realpolitik . " For all the speeches at the UN pledging antiterror solidarity , unilateral deployment of uncodified American superweapons would be like throwing a flash grenade into the 3-D chess game of international relations . The wariness in the President 's demeanor edged toward anger . " Why was n't the transition team brought up to speed on this two months ago ? "
