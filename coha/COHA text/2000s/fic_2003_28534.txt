Chapter One " Raise your knees . " Wide-eyed , breathless and straining , she said , " No , " in such a scandalized voice that Riley Moore grinned . That was the thing about Red - she made him laugh , made him feel lighthearted when he had n't thought such a thing would be possible ever again . Not a bad start . But he had other things to accomplish here besides smiling . " I 'm not letting you up till you do . " Hell , he 'd be happy to stay put for hours . Not only did she amuse him , she also aroused him more than any woman he 'd ever known . Her body was slight but very soft , a nice cushion under his larger , harder frame . And the warmth he felt in the cradle of her thighs could drive him over the edge . Her big green eyes darted left and right . " Riley , people are watching . " " I know . " He decided to taunt her . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle him . No sense in wasting all his instruction . " They 're waiting to see if you 've learned anything through all these lessons . Most of them think not . Others are pretty damn doubtful . " New determination drew her slim auburn brows down into a frown and turned her green eyes stormy . Suddenly her knees were along his sides , catching him off guard with the carnality of it . While his mind wandered down a salacious path , she bucked , rolled - and onto his back he went . Proud as a peahen , she bounced on his abdomen and cheered herself . Wrong move , sweetheart , he thought , and deftly flipped her straight back and into the same position that she 'd just escaped , except that this time her legs were trapped around his waist . With the wind temporarily knocked out of her , she gasped . Half frustrated , half amused , Riley straightened . Because he knew his own ability , even if most others did n't , he always utilized strict control and caution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd sooner break his own leg than ever bruise her . He pulled her upright , forced her arms straight up high to help her breathe , and shook his head . " When you get the upper hand on an attacker , honey , you do not stop to congratulate yourself . " Seeing that the display was over , the crowd dispersed , going back to their own training . Riley stood and gently pulled Regina Foxworth to her feet . She was n't necessarily a short woman , but next to his height , she seemed almost puny . The top of her head reached his shoulder . Her wrists were like chicken bones . Narrow shoulders , a delicate frame ... and yet , she wanted him to teach her self-defense . Riley snorted . Hell , whenever he got this close to her he had things other than fighting on his mind . And the fact that , regardless of what he 'd tried to teach her , she still ended up on her back with him in the mounted position put all kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to have her situated that way , with no clothes between them and without her attempting to escape . Soon , he promised himself . Very soon . In a huff , Regina promptly jerked away and began straightening her glorious red hair . If the woman thought half as much about applying herself as she did about her appearance , they 'd make more progress . For her lessons today she 'd restrained her hair in a braid as thick as his wrist that hung to the middle of her back . Already silky tendrils had worked loose , giving her a softened , just-laid look . Riley shook his head in awe . He worked with other women and they just got sweaty and rumpled . Not Regina . Somehow , no matter what , the woman always managed to look more appealing . Watching her tidy her braid sent tension rippling through his muscles . A man could conjure quite a few fantasies over that hair , not to mention the delicate , ultrafeminine body that came with it . Hell , he even found the sprinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a towel . " Quit pouting , Red . " " I 'm not . " But her bottom lip stuck out in a most becoming way . Normally a princess like her would n't have appealed to him . But Red had guts beneath the fussy exterior . And in the time he 'd known her , he 'd also realized she was gentle , compassionate , understanding , and damn it , he wanted her , had from the very start . If that had been his only problem , he 'd have coaxed her into bed by now . But it was more than that . He had n't thought to ever want involvement with another woman , but he wanted it with Red . Riley slung his arm around her shoulders and headed her toward the shower . Not that she needed to shower . The natural fragrance of her skin and hair was warm and womanly . His body tensed a bit more in masculine awareness , on the verge of cramping . " We 're wasting our time with these lessons . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . Three weeks ago , Regina had been caught in a burning building while on assignment for the Chester Daily Press . As a reporter , she liked to stick her cute little freckled nose into places where it did n't belong , and that particular building had been in a disreputable part of town . That should have been her first clue not to be there . The fact that the fireworks dealer had already had trouble in the past should have been her second . She 'd forged on anyway and had come damn close to dying for her efforts . Most were inclined to call the fire an accident due to the shoddy management of the owner , who left opened pyrotechnics scattered around . But there was more to it . Long before Red got caught up in that fire , she 'd been afraid . Riley first met her while she attempted to interview his friend , Ethan , for commendable work as a firefighter . Even then , she 'd been as jumpy as a turkey on Thanksgiving morning . She 'd seemed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . The day after the interview , she 'd come into his gym and asked for lessons to protect herself . Unlike most of the women who approached him with the same request , Red had seemed more desperate , as if she needed the lessons for an imminent threat , not for general assurances . Before the fire , he 'd discarded her claims of endangerment , as had the county police where he worked as an evidence tech . They still did n't believe her , but at thirty-two , through life and some hard lessons , Riley had learned to read people , to sift real from feigned . Red was afraid , and he 'd bet she had reason . Someone was after her . She did n't know why . He did n't care why . The day she 'd almost died in that fire , he 'd staked a claim . Little Red just had n't figured that out yet . But no way in hell would he let anyone hurt her . " Why do n't you shower up and we 'll talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long-suffering look . " There 's nothing more to say . The police do n't believe me , nothing else major has happened - " Riley jumped on her choice of words . " What do you mean , nothing major ? Has something minor happened ? " She shrugged , which did interesting things to her petite breasts . Dressed in snug biker shorts and a matching sports tank , there was n't much of her body left to his imagination . But then , he 'd wrestled with her enough and studied her in such detail that Riley already knew she had a discreet rack . Her breasts were small , firm and a definite draw to his eyes .
