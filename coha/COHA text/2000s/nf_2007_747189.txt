I do n't find the news I 'm looking for in the paper . But the ad for a male nurse with good references , to take care of a sick old man , could be one solution to my problem , if only temporarily . <p> A woman opens the apartment door on Delfim Moreira Avenue and I say I came because of the ad . She tells me to come in . An enormous living room . The windows are open and the sea is visible outside , very blue . Big goddam deal . A man is standing at the window and turns around when I come in . He comes toward me . <p> " It 's to take care of my father . Do you have references ? " <p> I do n't have references . Over twenty years ago , when I was a boy , I took care of a sick old man , and at his house I read dozens of books and had my sexual initiation with a rubber doll named Gretchen . But all I did was push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do . Good references , " I say . <p> " Very good . " The man looks at his watch . He says how much he 'll pay me per month ; he asks if I can start today , he 'll pay extra . He 's going to travel tonight and is in a hurry . <p> The woman is also in a hurry . <p> " I did n't bring any clothes , " I say . <p> " One thing that 's not lacking in this house is clothes . Open the closets and take what you want . Here on this paper are the addresses and telephones of my father 's attending physician and of our lawyer . If necessary , call the doctor , but nothing 's going to happen ; my father is healthy as an ox . Any other problems , money or whatever , speak with the lawyer . Here 's also the numbers of the pharmacy and the supermarket ; all you have to do is call , have them deliver , and sign for the bills . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse . It 's not very complicated . Every three days you have a day off ; a nurse will take your place . Then you can go home and pick up your clothes . Well , I think that takes care of everything . Any questions ? " <p> " No . " I want to get rid of him as badly as he wants to get rid of the old man . <p> " Ah , I almost forgot . My father 's name is Baglioni . Mr. Baglioni . Let 's go to his room . " <p> We go down a long corridor to the old man 's room . He 's lying on a bed . <p> " Dad , this is your new friend - What is your name ? " <p> " Jos . " <p> " Jos . He 's going to take care of you . " <p> The old man has white hair . He looks at me . He complains that he does n't like to have people come into his room when he is n't wearing his dentures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's Jos . " <p> The old man puts in his dentures . He looks at me . The man leans over and kisses the old man on the forehead . The woman does the same . <p> At the door the man gives me a wad of bills . " Three months in advance . Plus the bonus . Any questions ? " <p> " No . " <p> The woman sighs . Both , the man and the woman , look at their watches . They forgot to ask for my references ; they do n't want to waste any more time ; they 're going to travel and must be late . I go to the door with them . <p> " This key is to the door . The red one is to the safe . The medicine is in the safe . " <p> They leave . <p> I read the instructions . The safe , heavy , square , made of polished steel , is in the pantry . I open the safe ; all I see in it is medicine . I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closets . All the windows are barred . The people live on the third floor and have bars on the window . Afraid of Spider-Man . The walls of one of the rooms are taken up by shelves filled to the ceiling with books . Big goddam deal . The old man 's house in Flamengo was crammed with so many books that it made my head spin , but that was back then ; I was a kid . The kitchen is spacious , with an enormous electric stove , microwave , blenders , juicers , refrigerators , and freezers full of labeled plastic boxes and cupboards bulging with cans and boxes of food . But according to the instructions , for dinner the old man has vegetable soup and a bit of gelatin . Besides the food , which is ready in the freezer , I 'm supposed to give him a Pankreoflat pill , a Ticlid , and Lexotan , six milligrams . I know what Lexotan is used for ; since there are lots of boxes of it in the cupboard , I 'll take one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box and read the instruction sheet . I really enjoy reading medical instruction sheets . Ticlid is " a powerful antithrombin containing as its active component a new and original substance , ticlopine hydrochloride . Indicated in cases that require a reduction of the concentration and adhesion level of platelets . " Pankreoflat has " as active components Pancreatina triplex and dimethylpolysylloxan which have been rendered highly active through a special process . " <p> Eight o'clock . I had already warmed up the soup . I take the old man out of the bed and set him in the armchair . <p> " It 's time for your soup . " <p> " I do n't want any soup . " He has all his teeth in , uppers and lowers . <p> " Then eat the gelatin . " <p> " I do n't want any gelatin . " <p> If he does n't want it , he does n't want it , fine . But I force him to take the medicines . He must be nervous on our first day , but the Lexotan will lower his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man from the chair easily . Instead of feeling happy in my arms he looks at me as if he hated me . In bed , following instructions , I put a disposable diaper on him ; he tries to stop me , but he 's weak and his resistance is very minimal . <p> " Do you know who I am ? " he asks . <p> " Yes , I do , Mr. Baglioni , do n't worry . " <p> I pull on the cord with the button that rings the bell and put it beside the bed , next to the TV remote control , as instructed . <p> " If you want anything , ring the bell . " <p> I put the dishes in the washer . I get ham from the refrigerator and make a sandwich . <p> My room is comfortable , with a small bathroom , television and a bookcase . If it were the old days I would examine it book by book to see if any of them interested me , but I do n't even look at the bookcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news I 'm interested in . The old man does n't call me during the night ; the Lexotan must be doing its job . <p> I watch the final newscast of the evening . Nothing . <p> I walk around the house . I go into the library but do n't read any of the books . I take one of the old man 's Lexotans , but even then I ca n't get to sleep . I 'm a tough case . <p> At seven a.m . I go to see the old man . He 's already awake . I follow instructions . First I rinse his eyes with boric acid . Then I remove the diaper dirty from shit and urine . I clean the old man with a sponge , feeling tremendous disgust . I dress him in pajamas . <p> " I 'm going to bring your tea and toast . " <p> A newspaper had been stuck under the kitchen door . I open the newspaper but do n't find the item I was looking for . <p> I put a little milk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of toast . I give him an Adalat , " 20 mg of nifedipine , " and another of Tagamet , " **50;0;TOOLONG . " Next I transfer the old man from the bed to the armchair and turn on the television . Cartoons . " If you want anything , ring the bell . " <p> I reread the newspaper . Nothing . I pick up the phone . It 's necessary to be careful . I go back to the old man 's room . There 's an extension on his night table . I pretend to be straightening up the table and pull the phone cord out of the wall . The old man looks at me pensively ; maybe he realizes what I did . <p> I make the call from the living room . No one answers . I overhear a cross-connection . " They put ground glass in my borscht . " I hang up , concerned . Cross-connections make me nervous . Ground glass in the borscht ? Some code ? Smart people talk in code on the phone . I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers . <p> I hear the old man 's bell . <p> " I have a proposal , " he says . <p> Whenever anyone made me a proposal it 's always been no big goddam deal . " I ca n't listen to any of your proposals . " <p> " Open that closet , " the old man says . <p> The closet is full of boxes of cigars , Cuban , American , Jamaican , Dutch , Brazilian . " I do n't smoke , " I tell him . <p> " There 's a box of Empire cigars , is n't there ? A large box . Open the box . " <p> The box is full of cigars , as large and thick as a policeman 's billy . <p> " Well ? " says the old man . <p> " I do n't smoke . And if I did smoke , I would n't smoke one of those . " <p> " Not that box , the other one . " <p> The other box is full of hundred-dollar bills . Big goddam deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal , " I tell him . I put the box in its place and close the closet door . <p> The old man tries to grab my arm . " Listen , you imbecile , " he says . <p> " I 'm very sorry . If you want anything , ring the bell . " <p> I make a phone call from the living room again . The one I want does n't answer . <p> " They put ground glass in my Porsche . " It 's the cross-connection . Porsche ? Borscht ? Damned code . Borscht ? I hang up . <p> Lunchtime . Soup and papaya , taken from the freezer . Ticlid and Pankreoflat . <p> " You 'll never be anything in life , " he says . <p> For three days and nights I take care of the old man . He talks more all the time . <p> " Do you know when I discovered I was old ? When my pubic hair began to fall out and more hair started growing in my nose , " he tells me while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone calls I make . After the third cross-connection , I stop calling . Neither the newspapers or television has the news I 'm waiting for . <p> On the fourth day a nurse comes to relieve me . We 're more or less the same age . <p> " So Van disappeared ? " she says . <p> " What Van ? " <p> " Vanderley , the male nurse . " <p> " I do n't know anything about that . " <p> " When Van disappeared they wanted me to come and take over , but I told them I could n't leave my shift at the hospital . They know I work at the hospital . " <p> The apartment has another bedroom just for her . She goes into her bedroom and in a short time comes out dressed in a clean white uniform , with white cap , white shoes , and white stockings . A pleasant perfume comes from her body . <p> " Is Mr. Baglioni all right ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Where did you go to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I reply . <p> " Try to get here on time tomorrow . I have to be at the hospital at nine . " <p> " Do n't worry . " <p> " Van was always late . " <p> " I 'm never late . " <p> " Are those your clothes ? " <p> I 'm wearing a shirt and pants that are too short , which I got out of a closet somewhere in the house . <p> " The guy told me to get whatever clothes I wanted . I did n't have time to go home . Van 's the one to blame , for disappearing . " <p> " My name is Lou . " <p> " Lou ? " <p> " Lourdes . What 's yours ? " <p> " Jos . " I remembered the old man in Flamengo and his wheelchair . " Why is n't there a wheelchair here ? " <p> " Mr. Baglioni 's son does n't want one . " <p> " Why are the medicines in the safe ? " <p> " So Mr. Baglioni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even walk by himself . " <p> " Before he broke his femur he could . " <p> " So the bars on the window . " <p> " That was a long time ago , when he made the first attempt . " <p> I leave . I look for the doorman . " I work for Mr. Baglioni , on the third floor . Where 's the telephone switch box ? " <p> " What for ? " <p> " The phone 's got something wrong with it and I want to take a look . " <p> " Are you a repairman ? " <p> " Just show me where the box is . " <p> He takes me to a wooden door . " Here it is . But I do n't have the key . " <p> " You better get one right now or I 'll break this piece of shit down . " <p> He knows I 'm not kidding . People always know when I 'm not kidding . He gives me the key . <p> " You can go ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to identify the wires to Mr. Baglioni 's apartment . The building has only one apartment per floor . None of the phones is tapped , there at the box . But there are other places where it can be done . It 's a fucker . <p> I return the key to the doorman . I get a taxi . I 'm carrying the wad of money they gave me in my pocket . The other pocket is heavy with telephone tokens . I 've decided on the hotel I 'm going to , one on Buarque de Macedo Street , in the Flamengo district . I 've never been there . I never stay twice at the same hotel . On the way I buy a small suitcase , six pairs of undershorts , six shirts , a pair of pants , shaving cream and razor blades . <p> A mediocre hotel , with no telephone in the room , but that does n't bother me . A phone in the room is dangerous ; the switchboard operator amuses herself by listening to the guests ' conversations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after taking off my shoes . I spend the day lying in bed . <p> At night I go out , to call from a pay phone . Nobody answers . I buy a cheese sandwich and a can of Coca-Cola and go back to the hotel . I sit down on the only chair in the room . I 'm waiting to feel hungry and eat the sandwich and drink the Coca-Cola . <p> Through the gaps in the curtain daylight starts entering the room . I take a bath and shave . I pay the hotel and leave . I get a taxi . <p> I try to open the old man 's apartment and ca n't . A bolt is holding the door from the inside . I ring the bell . Lou opens the apartment door . Lou 's uniform is without a single wrinkle . Either she was on her feet all night or she put on a fresh uniform . I smell the perfume , from the uniform and from her body . <p> " I 've already given him the milk , the Adalat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaved him and cut his nose hair . You did n't perfume him . " <p> " It 's not in the instruction the guy gave me . " <p> " You have to cut his nose hair . The hairs grow fast , and he does n't like hairs in his nose . " <p> " It 's not in the instructions . " <p> " In the evening you did n't give him his milk with Meritenc . And do n't forget the Seloken . " <p> It 's in the instructions . Seloken , an inhibitor of the adrenergic receptors located mainly in the heart . " I missed it . How did you know I did n't give it to him ? " <p> " I just know . " <p> She goes into her room , changes clothes . Jeans , sneakers , a T-shirt , handbag on her shoulder . <p> " Where 's your uniform ? " <p> " I told the guy I was n't going to wear a uniform . Look , do n't butt into my life . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another thing . Was it you who pulled out the telephone wire in the bedroom ? " <p> " Yes . What 's that phone good for ? All it does it disturb the old man . " <p> " You may be right , " she said , before leaving . <p> " Good morning , " I tell the old man in his armchair , wearing striped pajamas . I smell the perfume . <p> " There is a plant in the Namibian desert that lives a thousand years on nothing but the morning dew , " he says . <p> Big goddam deal . I turn on the television . " If you want anything , ring the bell . " <p> I call from the living room . Nobody answers . This time there 's no cross-connection , or they 're keeping quiet , to hear what the others are saying . <p> The bell rings . <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Turn off the television and put me in bed . I 'm tired . " <p> He 's stretched out in bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get the book that 's in it . " <p> The hardbound book has his picture on the cover , twenty years younger . <p> " Is n't liking books as much as women a terrible sign ? " <p> I give him the book . " If you want anything , ring the bell . " <p> " Wait . You know when I discovered I was old ? When I started to enjoy eating more than fucking . That 's a terrible sign , worse than hair growing in your nose . Now I do n't even enjoy eating , " he says . <p> " I do n't enjoy eating either . If you want anything , ring the bell . " <p> " Read this book , " he says . <p> I pick up the book with his picture on the cover . " If you want anything , ring the bell , " I repeat . <p> I read the book , in my room . It 's a series of testimonials about the old man , from friends , professional colleagues , important people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the same thing about intelligence , generosity , culture , Baglioni 's public spirit . <p> At lunchtime the old man does n't speak to me about the book . In the afternoon I give him the Meritene with milk . At dinner he asks me if I read the book . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Well ? " <p> " Well what ? " <p> " I want your opinion . " <p> " I thought it was a piece of shit . A pile of stupidity . " <p> " I was going to die and my friends decided to publish the book . It was my fault . " He took out his teeth . He was already taking intimacies with me . " I 'm sleepy . Remind me later to talk about that . Do n't forget . I want to talk to you about it . " <p> I put him into the bed . Stretched out with his legs crossed . <p> I call from the living room phone . Finally they answer . <p> " It 's me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? " <p> " I ca n't say . Look - " <p> " They follow the lightning 's flash . " Holy shit , it 's the cross-connection . <p> " There 's a cross-connection . I 'm going to hang up . " <p> " Tell me where you are and I 'll call you back . I 'm going to have to go out . " <p> " They 're waiting for the rainbow . " Goddam cross-connection . <p> " Let me call you . " I hang up the phone and go to the old man 's room . He 's sleeping . If I go out for ten minutes he 's not going to wake up in that time . <p> I call from a pay phone in the street . It rings and no one answers . <p> I 'm back in my room . <p> Is it really a cross-connection ? The words are in code . The lightning flash voice seemed to be the same as borscht Porsche bosch , but maybe it was n't . Well , I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I take one of the old man 's Lexotans . <p> The next day , after cleaning the old man 's parts and rinsing his eyes with boric acid , and after giving him tea with milk with toast , the Adalat and Tagamet : <p> " Can you imagine how a guy feels who plans a book of panegyrics to be published after his death and who ends up not dying ? " <p> " What 's the problem ? " <p> " As I lay in my death throes , a hasty friend distributed the two thousand copies of the book , which they had n't showed me because I was dying , saying what a great loss my death was and showering me with praise . Even if the book were good , which it is n't , I would have to be embarrassed . I did n't die , understand ? " <p> " I understand . Were you really the greatest lawyer in Brazil ? " <p> " That 's another of the book 's idiocies . Nobody 's the greatest anything . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , at a time when economists had n't yet taken power . " <p> " There are worse things than having an idiotic book written about you . " <p> " Yes , yes , so there are . For example , a guy 's sperm becoming as thin as water . But I ca n't help but remember that ridiculous book . Over half of the books ended up in used-book stores . I sent a friend to buy all of them back , which cost me next to nothing ; they were gathering dust . I destroyed every one I could get my hands on . But there are others out there somewhere . " <p> His voice was short of breath . <p> " You can tell me the rest later . " <p> " You 're going to listen , are n't you ? You strike me as an intelligent sort . For a male nurse . " <p> " Tomorrow . Rest now . " <p> After breakfast , after lunch , and before dinner , always on those occasions , he sits me down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's easy enough to follow what he says ; a bit of rearranging . <p> The headaches arose overnight . So strong that the usual analgesics offered no relief . The doctors who examined him made their diagnosis and suggested that he get other opinions . Abroad , they confirmed the illness . The old man had six months to live , maybe a little more , maybe a little less . <p> His greatest fear was always to die suddenly without being able to tear up the papers that had to be destroyed , without rewarding those who should be rewarded or punishing those who should be punished ; without being able to dispose of his goods in a way he considered fair . Knowing that he had six months to live was a kind of consolation . He made his confession to a friend who was a priest and was absolved of his sins . He professed a good and compassionate religion that gave the opportunity for salvation to all until the last moment . He 'd always had a great capacity for suffering humiliation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After he had his revenge on those who had offended him , in the fullest and most absolute way , and he always had his revenge , he would afford himself the luxury of forgiving . Forgiveness after vengeance . So , among his last acts of will retaliation occupied an important spot . Yes , revenge was a sin , but at the last moment he would repent and be pardoned . The priest had told him that there was no exact time for repentance to enter the hearts of men , so long as it was real . The old man knew he would genuinely repent after annihilating his enemies and that he would die redeemed , ready to face whatever came after death . <p> The year before , prior to the medical diagnosis , he had been chosen man of the year by an important weekly magazine and had confided in his old friend Sampaio , with whom he had founded the largest law firm in the country , that he 'd like to stop and write his biography . He was starting to feel old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said that could wait for later ; there was a lot to do at the firm . And he 'd added , no doubt correctly , that the old man 's life did n't have the material for a biography that would be of interest to others . This Sampaio guy knew that there are lots of people who think their life is interesting but it 's not . Others think their life is shit and it is . <p> Lou arrives when the old man is sitting in the armchair telling about his life . I do n't bolt the door and she comes in and catches us talking . When he sees her , the old man 's face lights up . He seems to be in doubt about having her company or mine , now that I 've become a kind of confidant . Lou says she 's going to put on her uniform . I go after her . <p> " What 's the subject that has Mr. Baglioni so worked up ? " <p> " His life . " <p> " Really ? How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She comes out gleaming , all starched and perfumed . <p> " I 'm going to take a bath , " I say . <p> She 's standing at the door to my room when I come out . <p> " Did you take some Lexotan ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Hmm . " <p> " I 'm going to make a phone call before I leave . " <p> This time the phone rings only twice and someone answers . It 's a strange voice . <p> " Who 's speaking ? " I ask . <p> " Who do you want to talk to ? " <p> My ear throbs . Whenever I sense I 'm in danger my ear throbs . I hang up the phone , not knowing what to do . <p> " Do you mind if I sleep here today , during your shift ? " <p> " As long as you do n't interfere with my work . " she says . <p> I stay in my room , lying down . Out there it 's getting more dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You want anything for dinner ? " she asks from outside . The day went by quickly . <p> " No , thanks , " I shout from inside . <p> " I 'll bring it to you . " <p> " I 'm not hungry . Thanks . " <p> Lou knocks on the door . " You want anything for breakfast ? " The night went by quickly . " I 'm coming , " I shout . <p> " You slept in your clothes ? " Lou asks , at the breakfast table . <p> " I do n't have any pajamas . " <p> " Or a uniform . " <p> " Are you married ? " <p> " Why do you want to know ? " <p> " I was thinking about your husband . " <p> " I do n't have a husband . " <p> " A lucky guy . The one who did n't marry you . " <p> " Very funny . And you , are you married ? " <p> " I used to be married to Gretchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap . <p> There are lots of things on the table . I have tea with milk and toast . <p> " Are you on the same diet as Mr. Baglioni ? " <p> " I do n't feel hungry in the morning . " <p> " You 're very thin . They 're going to think you have AIDS . " <p> " I do . " <p> " That joke is n't funny . " <p> " Thanks for the tea . " I feel like asking what perfume Lou is wearing , but I leave the table . The old man 's bell rings . <p> He is shaved , washed , and perfumed . " Has the girl left ? " <p> " She 's finishing her breakfast . " <p> " When she leaves , come back here . We have to talk . " <p> Sampaio was right . The old man was incapable of writing his own biography . He 'd been married to three jealous women and been afraid of them all , more of the first than the second and a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to make his getaway without the wife he was married to at the time suspecting ; at least twice a week , for over thirty years , he would make up some business lunch and tell his secretary so he could hop into bed with another woman without arousing suspicions . <p> His last wife was the calmest of all . He had always married poor women . At the time of the first marriage he was poor himself , but by the second he was already a very rich man and the wife was a crafty and unscrupulous young woman from the outskirts . There are men who ca n't be humiliated , not because they do n't feel the humiliation but because they consider themselves above it . So , the embarrassment to which his second wife subjected him had been administered coldly . He would lie beside her at night thinking of how to make her go back to the petit bourgeois ostracism from which he had taken her . He pretended , up to a certain point , to know nothing about his wife 's lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigolo who claimed to be a metopomanist and went by Jos de Arimathea , probably a false name . <p> " Metopomanist ? What the shit is that ? " I ask . <p> The old man knows the reason for remembering that individual , out of the several of his second wife 's lovers that he knew about . Arimathea told him , on the day they met , at a dinner at his house , given by his second wife to present the guy to high society , that he was n't a card reader , a palm reader or a charlatan , but rather a scientist who studied people 's character by the lines in their forehead and made projections ; some erroneously called that science metoposcopy , which besides being etymologically incorrect , recalled dactyloscopy , endoscopy , and other less transcendental oscopics . And Arimathea had asked him if he , the old man , knew why women were more mysterious than men . <p> " Know what the charlatan told me ? That women are more mysterious than men only because they hide the wrinkles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson . I never saw , until we got married , my second wife 's face without it being covered in elaborate makeup , the same makeup she was wearing when she was chosen Miss Nova Iguacu Country Club and which she thought gave her the subtle and porcelain-like exotic look of an actress in Japanese theater . " <p> In the middle of the story the old man has an asthma attack . I get the Berotex Spray and apply it to his mouth . Since the attack does n't go away , I stick two suppositories of children 's Eufilin up him . It 's in the instructions . Lou explained to me that there used to be an Euphyllin with ph and two l 's , a bronchodilator for adults , but they did away with that medicine and made Eufilin with simplified spelling for children , but children and old people are the same thing . <p> " I 'm going to rest a bit now .

" the old man asks . <p> " No . I came to see if the money was still here . " <p> " She 's honest . Treat her well . I need her more than I do you .

He opens his eyes , looks at me . He closes his eyes . Opens . Closes . Sleeps . Asleep , he reminds me of an old dog I had when I was a child . <p> I stretch out on the sofa . I smell Lou 's scent ; she must lie there during the night , watching over the old man , like a good nurse . How is it her uniform does n't have a single crease , a fold , a small wrinkle ? <p> After lunch I pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to make the old man walk there , but he 's afraid of putting any weight on the leg he broke and into which a metal prosthesis was inserted , with the result that he walks disjointedly , limping , looking like he 's about to fall at any moment . In the library there 's a large armchair where I make the old man comfortable . I turn on the floor lamp beside the chair . <p> " Get the Macaulay , with the red cover , " he says . " These days I only enjoy reading the old historians . Burckhardt , Gibbon , Mommsen . I read without glasses , did you know that ? " <p> I find the book . I take it out of the bookcase and hand it to him . <p> " Can you manage to read that small print ? " <p> The book is in English . " Yes . " <p> " Then read . " <p> " He was still in his novitiate of infamy " I read . <p> " You read English ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse , " I say , but he does n't catch the irony . <p> " Macaulay is speaking of Barere . " <p> " Can I go out for a short time ? " <p> " It 's not in the instructions , " says the old man . " I 'm joking . You may go . " <p> " Five minutes . " <p> I check that the safe with the medicine is securely locked ; you can never be too careful . I leave . I call from a pay phone . <p> " Where are you ? " <p> " That 's not important , " I say . <p> " I need to talk to you . " <p> " So talk . " <p> " You yourself said it was dangerous over the phone . " <p> " I 'm speaking from a public phone . " <p> " It 's still dangerous . Let 's meet . " <p> " I 'll think about it . I 'll call you later . " <p> " Later might be too late . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . I throw the paper in a trash can . <p> The old man has fallen on the floor , in the middle of several books . <p> " I tried to get the Burckhardt from the shelf and fell . This book here . " He shows me the book he has in his hands . <p> I sit the old man down in the armchair . He gives me the book . " I want you to read me a passage from this book . " <p> I open the book . " I do n't read German . " <p> " Ah , ah , " he says . " I 'll read it for you . " <p> He translates as he reads , without hesitation . It 's the story of a general and the inhabitants of a city that the general liberated from the enemy . Every day they would meet to see how they could reward the general , but they could never find a compensation worthy of the great favor he had done them . Finally , one of them had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patron saint of the city . Which is what they did . <p> " Did you understand it ? " <p> Big goddam deal . A long time ago I stopped considering important anything you read in books . <p> " I find your life more interesting . " <p> " Really ? " He throws the book on the floor and happily resumes his story . <p> The metopomanist had taught him a lesson . So when he met his future third wife , the first thing the old man asked her was to wash her face . And behind the makeup , because this woman also used makeup perfectly , he discovered traces of melancholy , sadness , and death , which had made him like her more than all the others . But he continued having love affairs ; it was much more exciting when he was married . Maybe that 's why he had married early and remained a bachelor such a short time between wives . <p> The more money he made , the more power he exercised , the greater his desire for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower courts and to the high court , the influence that he exercised in the elections of every type that he manipulated , even for run-of-the-mill races like the academies of letters and medicine . One day , in February , a month after turning sixty-nine , upon managing the nomination of an idiot minister who almost brought down the government , he preferred going to lunch with a lawyer from the office , breaking an appointment with a beautiful woman who had taken a lot of work to convince to go to bed with him . For some time he had liked eating and drinking in ever larger amounts ; he tried fruitlessly to stop the growth of his waist with herbal teas and homeopathic pills and daily massages in the morning before leaving for the office . The flaccid protuberance of his belly , his large , square butt , his sagging breasts which , if not covered by hair could recall those of an old woman , the penis that had become thin , long , and soft , more and more like a frozen , empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been demanding of him a certain caution in amorous encounters . He avoided rooms with mirrors , especially on the ceiling : when women fornicate in rooms with mirrors on the ceiling they become mesmerized by the reflection of their own body , but at certain moments they also look at their companion 's . So the lights should be turned out ; half-shadow was the maximum brightness acceptable in the room . In the act of taking off and putting on clothes there was a sense of opportuneness to be obeyed , a right moment for taking off the shirt , the pants , the shorts , for getting into and out of bed ; the right distance between him and his partner had to be rigorously established , the closer the better . And after sex it was necessary to prevent the woman from seeing that his come was thin and as watery as skim milk . It was necessary to have the bathtub ready and take the woman there immediately and wash her pussy pretending that this was an act of submissive affection . Fucking demanded rigorous staging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of various kinds that any woman who goes to bed with a man creates for him . <p> One hot , humid February , instead of looking for new women , he started thinking about those he 'd already had ; or imagining , just fantasizing , how it would be to copulate with the pretty women he met at social dinners , without , however , getting involved with them , satisfying himself merely with suggestive conversation , seductive but innocuous . <p> " I always wanted to die slowly , without haste . My greatest fear in life was always that I 'd die suddenly without being able to organize my life . " <p> " You told me that . You 're repeating yourself . I think it 's best to rest a bit . " <p> I pick up the old man and carry him to the bedroom . I give him two Lexotans . I imagine I 'm him , while I wait for the old man to fall asleep . I stick my finger in my nose and do n't feel any hairs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his nose ; Lou must have cut them . I need to have a look at my come . <p> Time is passing , I have to act , do something . It ca n't be by phone ; it might be tapped . If I could only decipher those codes ; ground glass in the borscht , guys orienting themselves by the thunder , what the shit could that be ? <p> The old man is sleeping . I check the safe . I leave for the street . I call from the pay phone . <p> " We need to see each other . " <p> " Not yet , " I say . " They put ground glass in my borscht . " I wait for the reaction from the other end . <p> Silence . <p> " They orient themselves by the thunder . " <p> " I do n't understand . " <p> " By the flash of lightning . " <p> " I still do n't understand . We need to see each other . " <p> I hang up . <p> The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listless . Two Lexotans at once is too much for him . He is n't hungry , and he does n't tell me the story of his life . <p> Lou arrives . She asks what 's wrong with the old man . I do n't mention the two Lexotans . <p> I like the perfume of her body . When Lou laughs , a little of her gum shows , pink and healthy flesh . Looked at without preconception , she 's pretty . But today , taking away the perfume , she does n't look well , and it 's not just worry over the old man . Something happened with her . While she goes to take care of the old man , I prepare coffee for the two of us . I know that Lou likes toast with raspberry jam and coffee with cream . <p> " Let 's bury the hatchet , " I say . <p> Lou pensively takes a small sip from her cup . " I 'm not fighting with you . " <p> " I made the toast you like , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , trying to smile . She merely nibbles the toast . <p> I tell her I 'm also going to stay home today . She repeats that it does n't bother her . I go to my room . <p> At lunchtime I ask how the old man is and Lou answers that he 's all right now . <p> I spend the day in my room and go out only twice , to get something to eat . Once I catch her crying but pretend I did n't see anything . <p> In the morning she 's still unhappy and I feel like hugging and kissing her . Lou leaves without my being able to say a word of encouragement to her . <p> The old man , as always after being taken care of by Lou , is alert , as well as clean and fragrant . <p> " Sit there and listen , " the old man says . <p> Because he was feeling great pain , at the time he thought he was about to buy it , the doctors injected him with morphine . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was thirty years old again and plunging into the calm waters of a beach in the Northeast , protected by reefs that calmed and heated the waves . As he floated in these warm , salty waters , scenes came into his mind of women he 'd had , the other women , not his wives , which he remembered as if he were in a theater . Solange , sitting on the low dresser in the apartment on Athne Square , her legs folded under her so that her feet could also rest on the piece of furniture , her in front of him , their heads at the same level , and his penis , without needing to be guided by his hand or hers , found its tepid groove . Sara , whom he awaited nude , walking back and forth in the apartment , and when she arrived he would furiously tear off the clothes she was wearing and start to possess her standing up , in the foyer . Sonia , in the launch during a storm beyond the bar , both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwed in the rocking cabin . Silvia , his first wife 's best friend , fucking him in the living room while his wife took a bath upstairs . The morphine made him recall the women in groups of names beginning with the same letter . Another day there was Martha , Myrthes , Miriam . Later , Heloisa , Helga , Hilda . He had fucked every letter of the alphabet . <p> He no longer feels pleasure at recalling his libidinous feats . All that remains is a happiness , which could be called erotic , but which he prefers to consider aesthetic . But he does n't tell me that ; I 'll find that out later . <p> " But I did n't die . Understand ? I got even with my wives , my enemies , at least some of them , and by an ironic twist of fate ended up punishing myself with that grotesque book of encomiums , suffering an even greater chastisement than I had inflicted on others . " <p> He had been invited to and had agreed to participate in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the presidential inauguration banquets , all the luxurious free feeds ; he had appeared at least once a week in the society columns in the major newspapers in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo . Some idiot had said that in detail in the book of panegyrics . Another one wrote of the trips he had taken . About kissing the Pope 's ring . All those big goddam deals . <p> " I 'll pass into history as a ridiculous arriviste . " <p> " How did you get even with your wives ? " <p> " With one , by watching with pleasure as she died of cancer . Another , by having her killed . She 'd been Miss Guadalupe Country Club . " <p> " You said before that she 'd been Miss Nova Iguacu . " <p> " Guadalupe . When she had access to free caviar she 'd eat like a pig , knowing it would give her intense diarrhea . She lied even when she said she 'd read The Little Prince . Do you think I 'm a monster ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I came home unexpectedly and found her in bed with a guy she said was teaching her art history . I let it pass . But when the tennis instructor slapped her on the court at the country club out of jealousy over another lover , that was too much . It 's easy to have a person killed when you have power and money . Easier still if you 're somebody like me with cardinals , condottieri , artists , and mafiosi in your genealogy . Have you heard of the Baglioni , of Perugia ? Fifteenth century , Italy . They 're my ancestors . They 're in Burckhardt . " <p> Big goddam deal . " No . What about the third one ? The one who did n't use makeup and you knew from the lines on her face that she was a good person . " <p> " She killed herself . I do n't want to talk about that . It was my fault . There are sins so great they can only be punished by absolution . " <p> " And you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see you 're suffering from that forgiveness . " <p> " I suffer more from that indestructible book of adulation . " <p> Then he repeats again that he bought up all the books he could find and destroyed them , but many survived scattered throughout Brazil and the world , and he talks about the embarrassment and all that . <p> He 's very tired . <p> " I think it 's best to rest a bit . " <p> " Yes , we 'll continue later . " <p> I lie down on the sofa , to keep an eye on the old man but also to smell Lou 's perfume . I sleep and dream about her . I stick my hand between the buttons of her immaculate white nurse 's blouse and caress her small breast . That 's the entire dream . <p> In the morning , when I give the old man a sponge bath , I think about Lou . Today is the day she comes . The old man confides in me again , I listen to the acts of infamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother and the daughter " ) , his maxims ( " happily married women make the best lovers , " " power increases sexual desire , " " a man should lose his teeth while still young so that the loss does n't interfere with his libido " ) . He refers for the hundredth time to the frustration he felt at preparing to die and not dying . <p> " The doctors told me I could relax because I still had six months to live . I could prepare to die and I did prepare . Those idiot doctors discovered only later that I had a disease that would make me an invalid but would n't kill me . I 'm never going to die . " <p> " You already told me that . " <p> I want Lou to show up right away ; dreaming about her left me anxious . I have no patience to listen to the old man 's stories . I like him ; it 's just that I have very little patience right now . <p> Lou arrives in her street uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sneakers . She 's still sad . She goes into her room . She reappears in her impeccable uniform . I 'm going to tell her I dreamed about her and that in the dream I stuck my hand inside her blouse and caressed her breast . But because she still has a sad look on her face , I say instead : " Are you unhappy ? What happened ? " <p> " My boyfriend left me . " <p> She perhaps expects me to say something , but I remain silent . <p> " He left me for another woman . " <p> As I say nothing , she heads for the old man 's bedroom . <p> The newspapers do n't have the news that concerns me and I should n't make phone calls because they might find out my address . The best thing would be to sleep in the old man 's apartment , but I think it 's better not to stay by myself with a woman who 's been cast aside ; that 's cowardice . I tell Lou I 'll be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different hotel , the Apa this time , on Barata Ribeiro Street . As always , I use my false identification card . In the room , I take off my shoes and lie down on the bed . I think about Lou . I was n't able to tell her I 'd dreamed about her ; saying that to an abandoned woman is playing dirty . At night I go out . Standing up , in a nearby bar , I eat a cheese sandwich and drink a beer . <p> I sleep sitting up in the hotel room and again dream about Lou , but it 's a nightmare . We 're in bed and she changes into Gretchen and escapes from my embrace like one of those blow-up balls when it 's punctured . She even makes that little sound of air escaping through the hole . <p> As always , the old man 's apartment door is locked from the inside and I have to ring the bell for Lou to open the door . <p> The old man is acting in a funny manner , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I smell her perfume . She tells me that today it 's her turn to prepare my breakfast , but she does n't know what I like . <p> " Just coffee is fine . " <p> Lou does n't seem as depressed . She 's still unhappy , but she seems to have made a decision , which always makes people stronger . <p> Over breakfast she observes me . <p> " You were never a nurse . I know . " <p> It 's not a criticism . It 's curiosity . <p> " A long time ago I took care of an old man in Flamengo Beach . While the old man was dying I used to pass the days reading the books in his library and the nights making love to a plastic doll . " <p> " A plastic doll ? How sad . " <p> " I was a kid . " <p> " Did you like her ? The doll ? " <p> " I was a lonely kid . With Gretchen I could talk . " <p> " What happened to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found me another one , called Claudia . " <p> " Another plastic doll ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " What happened to her ? " <p> " I stopped being a child . I got tired of playing with dolls . " <p> " You 're not playing with me , arc you ? " <p> " No . " <p> " And today ? What do you really do ? " <p> The bell from the old man 's room interrupted our conversation . <p> " The old man is calling . See you Wednesday , " I say , sending her on her way . <p> I go to see the old man . <p> " Has the girl left ? " <p> " She 's on her way now . " <p> " Had you ever met a killer before ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And did you despise them ? Or hate them ? Fear them ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Have you ever killed anyone ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? What did you feel , when you killed your wife ? " <p> " Nothing , at first . But as a lawyer and a Christian I knew that killing someone , besides a crime , was a sin . I could go to hell for it . Then I repented and confessed . I was repentant and was absolved . I 'm going to heaven , understand ? My repentance was genuine . Divine justice has subtleties that man 's justice lacks . But that 's not the pardon that anguishes me . " <p> " Want me to take you to the library ? " <p> " No . Actually , I suspect that Macaulay is an idiot . The others , even though they wrote some interesting things about my ancestors , are idiots too . Everything tires me . I no longer find Lou 's nudity pleasurable . Heraclitus said that nothing is permanent except change . But I do n't want to go to heaven . " <p> " That 's none of my business . " <p> " Yes , it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal . " <p> " There 's a lot of money in that cigar box . " <p> " I 'm not interested . " <p> " Please . I do n't want to go to heaven . " <p> Suddenly he 's crying . His voice is thin and pleading , like a child 's . " Please , help me , I do n't want to go to heaven . " <p> I wait for him to stop crying . <p> " All right , " I say . " As far as I 'm concerned , you can go to hell . " <p> He explains how I can help him . A glass of water and two boxes of Lexotan . Each box has twenty small pink pills . Generic name bromazepan . <p> I place a glass and a bottle of water and two boxes of pills on the night table . He 's lying down , his legs crossed . <p> " From the start I knew I could count on you . Raise me up so I can lean against the pillows . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to heaven ? " <p> " You understand me . " <p> The Lexotan pills arc small and he swallows them two at a time , sitting up with his back supported by the pillows . <p> " I once wanted to live a long time , to watch all my enemies die . But as soon as one enemy dies you remember the existence of another . Or you invent another . They never end . " <p> The forty pills are taken with several glasses of water . The bottle is empty . <p> He stretches out in the bed again , his legs crossed . <p> " I have to die alone . " <p> I get the cigar box with the money . I go to my room . <p> Much later the bell rings and I go to the old man 's room , but it was n't him who rang the bell . He 's lying motionless on the bed , his legs crossed . His serene face is n't of someone who went to purgatory , or worse . <p> The bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I came to finish our conversation . May I come in ? " <p> I step aside . She comes in . <p> " Mr. Baglioni ? " <p> " He 's sleeping . " <p> " Are you surprised I came today ? At this hour ? " <p> " Not very . You have on your nurse 's uniform . " <p> She goes to her room . I hear a car alarm in the street . I take the living room telephone off the hook . <p> Lou 's white uniform is without a crease . She comes toward me . Her light-brown eyes have a green mark around the iris . I delicately open the button of Lou 's white blouse and caress one of her breasts . Lou closes her eyes . I rebutton the blouse . Lou looks at me as if she knew who I am , as if there were no barriers between us and she could now confide in me . <p> She takes my hand . We go to her room . I smell her perfume . She removes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have fewer clothes to take off . <p> In bed she says incomprehensible things , mixed with screams and sighs . She strains to give herself ; she wants to come . <p> Afterward she sleeps , one arm on my chest . She wakes up for a brief moment and asks , " Am I better than the plastic doll ? " and I answer yes . <p> I spend the rest of the night awake , thinking . A little before morning she awakens . She stretches . <p> " Do you want more ? " Lou asks shyly , knowing that to be more seductive . I do n't feel like it but I say yes . She 's calmer now and takes delight , without screams , and satisfies herself , without sighs . <p> Lou goes to take a bath . I remain in bed , thinking . She returns naked from the bathroom . <p> " Do you want me to put on the uniform ? " <p> " No . You can wear the other clothes . " <p> Lou has a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . <p> " The old man told me he no longer found enjoyment in your nudity . " <p> " He said that ? " <p> " Were you nude in front of him ? " <p> She is slow to reply . " I would take off my clothes and he 'd ask me to walk around in the room . But he never touched me . It was a quick thing . He would go to sleep right away . Once he cried . No , he cried twice , thinking about the life he 'd led . Are you angry ? " <p> " No . And when he 'd go to sleep you 'd lie down naked on the sofa and sleep too . " <p> " How did you know ? Did Mr. Baglioni tell you ? " <p> " Your unwrinkled uniform . And the smell of perfume on the sofa . " <p> " I 'm hungry , " Lou says . <p> I make her coffee with cream . I put raspberry jam on the toast . <p> " You came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toast . <p> " The old man died . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Mr. Baglioni died . " <p> " My God . Why did n't you tell me ? Him dead and us , us doing that . " <p> " He killed himself . He took forty pills . " <p> Lou gets up and runs to the bedroom . She leans over the old man . He 's dead and cold . <p> " Poor thing , " Lou says . <p> " He asked to be by himself . " <p> I take Lou to my room . I get the cigar box full of hundred-dollar bills . <p> " He told me to give you this . " After all , she paraded nude in front of him , gave him his final moments of joy . <p> " You killed Mr. Baglioni , " she says with a deep sigh . <p> " Go on , take it . " <p> " I do n't want that money . " <p> " You have to accept it . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put my things in it . Lou watches me , confused . <p> " Call the doctor , the one whose name is in the instructions , and tell him that through my negligence the old man got hold of the pills .

The lawyer 's name is also in the instructions . Nobody 's going to be upset at his death . " <p> " I am . " <p> " Nobody else . Do n't worry . Excuse me for leaving this for you to do . I have my reasons . " <p> " Will we see each other again ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " Give me your phone number . " <p> " I do n't have a telephone .

My homage to the old man . <p> I go to the Hotel Itajub , downtown . <p> I take off my shoes , lie down , and wait for night to come .
