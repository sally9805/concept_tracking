THE BIRD WATCHER <P> In the middle of a conversation in his office at AeroVironment , the high-tech company he founded and heads , Paul MacCready suddenly pauses , apologizes , opens a notebook already jam-packed with sketches and notes and jots down a new idea . " I 've got a restless mind that just sort of darts around , " he says apologetically . <P> This modest explanation hardly does justice to a cerebral process that has resulted in the world 's first successful man-powered and solar-powered aircraft , earned its owner the title of Engineer of the Century from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and won him worldwide acclaim . Now at 75 he is still spewing out offbeat and innovative ideas faster than his creative team at AeroVironment can act on them . Currently in the works are projects ranging from a solar-powered , unmanned plane with a wingspan nearly as large as a football field to a pocket-size device that substitutes for a visit to the health club to a contraption that literally makes a backpacking hiker light on his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When it comes to my abilities , " he says , " I think that there is a lot less than meets the eye . " He admits he 's good at " synthesizing concepts " and making connections . Perhaps his most innovative thoughts occur away from work , particularly when " getting away on vacation , where you can relax , daydream and let your mind wander . " In fact , MacCready considers daydreaming his most with his family during a month-long summer vacation . Random thoughts flitted across his mind  --  a $100,000 note he had co-signed for a relative , now unexpectedly due ; the news from Britain about the pound , which had risen to around $2 ; yes , and the Kremer Prize . Why , he mused , had no one been able to claim the pound50,000 offered by British industrialist Henry Kremer for the first man-powered flight around a mile-long , figure-eight course ? " Then a light bulb went on above my head , " says MacCready . " It was a eureka moment . " The Kremer Prize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes inspiration is just that mundane . Necessity , invention 's putative mother , comes in many guises . <P> BIRD WATCHING <P> Back behind the wheel several days later , while MacCready was glancing upward watching birds circle , he drew on his physics and aeronautical education from Yale and Caltech , casually estimating the birds ' bank angle . By timing their circles , he calculated their speed . His mind drifted to hang gliders and sailplanes , comparing their flying characteristics with those of birds . Then came the second  --  and more creative  --  eureka moment . The Kremer Prize was as good as won . <P> " If you triple the size of a hang-glider-size plane and triple its wingspan to 90 ft. while keeping its weight the same , " MacCready explains , " the power needed to fly it goes down by a factor of 3 , to about 0.4 horsepower . " And that , he knew , was what a trained cyclist could pump out for several minutes at a stretch .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
