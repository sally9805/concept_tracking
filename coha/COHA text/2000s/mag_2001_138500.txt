IN TORONTO , the self-anointed capital of Planet Hockey , a city where trade rumors fly like snow-flakes , citizens were doing Rob Blake math : // Add 31 ( age of Blake , the Los Angeles Kings ' franchise defenseman who , by the combination of his years in the NHL and the fact that his contract is up at the end of this season , becomes an unrestricted free agent on July 1 ) // +1,000,000 ( roughly the difference in annual dollars between what the Kings appear willing to pay him and what Blake seems willing to accept ) // +90 ( time , in minutes , it takes to drive from the Blake family farm in Simcoe , Ont. , to downtown Toronto ) // +17 ( difference in rank between the Kings ' No. 2 power play this season and the Maple Leafs scuffling unit ) // +33 ( years since the Maple Leafs last won the Stanley Cup ) // +121 ( Blake 's league-leading total of blocked shots this season ) . // To Torontonians the solution was obvious : 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Rumors swirled that Blake would become a Maple Leaf last week during the Kings ' only trip this season to eastern Canada , but Blake refused to get sucked into the eddy of general managers ' talk and media wishful thinking . He told reporters on Jan. 17 that he hoped to remain in Los Angeles , and that was that  --  except for the few steps he playfully took that day toward the Toronto locker room as his teammates filed past on the way to their own . The Kings left the Air Canada Centre later that night with their full complement of players , two hard-earned points after a sparkling 2-1 victory ( in which Blake nearly scored on a rink-length rush ) and their sense of humor . " Hey , Nelson , " Los Angeles coach Andy Murray called to right wing Nelson Emerson , Blake 's childhood friend , the next day as the Kings prepared to board a flight to North Carolina . " Make sure your buddy gets on the plane . " // Blake and the Kings are involved in a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $15 million contract and wants to stay in Los Angeles . The Kings  --  who through Sunday were 22-17-7-1 and on the fringe of the playoff picture yet figure to lose $5 million this season  --  want to keep him . While neither the player nor the team will disclose figures , reports put the Kings ' latest offer at $8 million a year and Blake 's asking price at $9 million , less than the average of $9.2 million that market-setting St. Louis Blues defenseman Chris Pronger received in the three-year contract he signed in October . // The outcome of the negotiations could determine the Kings ' future as well as the fortunes of as many as eight other teams that think they can win the Stanley Cup this year . If Los Angeles trades Blake to defense-starved Toronto or another contending club before the March 13 deadline  --  letting him leave next summer for a compensatory draft pick is n't an option for a general manager who likes his job , as the Kings ' Dave Taylor seems to  --  that team will have the inside track to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake can leverage the entire league . ( Bourque transformed the Colorado Avalanche , which after acquiring him won 23 of its last 32 games and reached Game 7 of the Western Conference finals before losing to the Dallas Stars. ) // There will be the usual flurry of trades before the deadline , mostly by general managers who want to plug a hole , but Blake is the only player whose move in the next seven weeks could shift the power in the NHL . " He 's the best defenseman in the league , by a lot , " says Los Angeles left wing Luc Robitaille , who is also eligible for unrestricted free agency on July 1 . " He hits , he 's our key defensive player , he 's our most dangerous player on the power play , and no other big guy can skate as fast as he can . If you take him by himself , he 's unbelievable . Now put him on one of the top teams , and his impact is incredible . " // Through Sunday , Blake had 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point-per-game pace that would be the most productive of his 11-year career . Along with Bourque , Pronger and Al MacInnis of the Blues , Brian Leetch of die New York Rangers and Nicklas Lidstrom of the Detroit Red Wings , Blake , the league 's leading goal scorer at his position , is one of the defensemen who towers over hockey , even though he has an unsightly plus-minus rating ( 0 ) . // He 's also one of eight potential unrestricted free agents among the top 30 scorers . That number might reflect nothing more than the unprecedented quality of this year 's unrestricteds  --  try these guys on your power play : Robitaille , Avalanche center Joe Sakic , Blues center Pierre Turgeon , New Jersey Devils right wing Alexander Mogilny , Phoenix Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick , injured Philadelphia Flyers left wing John LeClair and Washington Capitals right wing Peter Bondra  --  but Oliver Stone has made films based on shakier theories than one that maintains that every potential unrestricted free agent who has a standout season excels only because he 's on a salary drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not there the other years of a contract , " Murray says . " Something in the back of their heads , a little inspiration , seems to kick in . You talk about stats for baseball players : How often have you seen the numbers go way up in the free-agent year ? Baseball players seem to turn it up when they need to . I do n't think that hockey players necessarily do that , but if you look at the numbers , there 's certainly some indication of it . " // The implacable Blake is as unmoved by that theory as he was by the rumor mill in Toronto . The one flash point came in September when , he says , the Kings gave him 12 hours to respond to a take-it-or-leave-it offer , reportedly $22.5 million for three years . Blake and his agent , Ron Salcer , needed all of five minutes to turn it down . In a fit of pique unbecoming an NHL captain , Blake resigned his position , although within a week he changed his mind about not wearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kings with or without a letter on his chest . // Taylor met with Blake and Salcer again last month , and though Blake said the discussion cleared the air , he added that no specific contract offer was made . Taylor , however , says , " We have made a number of offers to Rob , and they 've all been rejected . " Meanwhile Los Angeles has heard from several clubs inquiring about Blake , setting the stage for a perhaps necessary option that would strip the Kings of an explosive player and call into question management 's commitment to winning . " I do n't see how they can afford not to sign him , " says Bill Watters , Toronto 's assistant to the president . " They have a big building to fill , and he 's their key player . " // The Kings and Blake have some common ground . It 's sand . While Blake is a farm kid , he has embraced Southern California , especially the beach culture . He lives in Manhattan Beach with his wife , Brandy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're on the sand , " Emerson says  --  and has become an accomplished beach volleyball player . Most hockey players hit 265-yard drives in the off-season . Blake , a clichd 6 ' 4 " California blond , spikes . He 's an A tournament player , which , in hockey terms , he says , " is like playing one level below the East Coast league . " // He 's also tied to the area by the Kings ' occasional shining moments , especially the rollicking run to the 1993 finals . In the championship series against the Montreal Canadiens , the L.A. Forum shook , and fans queued up outside an airport hotel to gaze slack-jawed at the Stanley Cup , a rite of spring in cities like Detroit and Denver but a startling development in preoccupied Los Angeles . In his perfect world Blake would win a Cup with the Kings . Pressed last week for a list of four other cities in which he might like to play , he mentions Toronto and then stops . // " At this stage in my career I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've made strides here , but are we a Stanley Cup team right now ? No . We have holes to fill . I 'm only a few months from free agency , but if I got traded , it would be difficult for me to make a quick decision on signing a long-term extension as part of that deal . That makes it tougher on the Kings "  --  Blake 's trade value would be reduced if the team that obtained him thought it was merely leasing him for the rest of this season  --  " but that 's how it is . I would need time to make the right decision . " // He made the right decision last Saturday , drifting into the high slot to one-time a shot on a five-on-three power play , a laser that touched off a string of four Los Angeles goals in a 6-3 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes , the Kings ' third consecutive road win . Blake had a satisfying afternoon : a goal , an uncharacteristic but cathartic fight with feisty Bates Battaglia and a victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom line .
