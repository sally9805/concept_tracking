From his early days in Miles Davis ' quintet to his groundbreaking work with the rap trio A Tribe Called Quest , Ron Carter is the rare bassist who propels music as much with his ideas as his skills . On this , his first album-length experiment with Latin jazz , Carter realizes that others have come before him , so rather than beat the congas to a pulp , his expert quartet , featuring ace percussionist Steve Kroon , flirts with them . Latin classics like Besame Mucho and Corcovado are splendidly reworked into disciplined , mid-tempo jazz tunes , while samba-flavored Carter originals Loose Change and Mi Tempo prove that playing in the cultural middle ground has its own intellectual thrill . <P>  --  By Josh Tyrangiel
