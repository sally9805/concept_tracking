This was the year when the grief started to lift and the worries came in . During the first weeks of 2002 , two dark moods entered the room , two anxieties that rattled down everybody 's nerve paths , even on good days , and etched their particulars into the general disposition . To begin with , after Sept. 11 , the passage of time drew off the worst of the pain , but every month or so there came a new disturbance  --  an orange alert , a dance-club bombing in Bali , a surface-to-air missile fired at a passenger jet  --  that showed us the beast still at our door . In the confrontation with Iraq , in the contested effort to build a homeland defense , we all struggled to regain something like the more secure world we thought we lived in before the towers fell . But every step of the way we wondered  --  was this the way back ? What exactly did we need to be doing differently ? <P> And all the while there was the black comedy of corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 90s had produced so many buccaneers ? You could laugh about the CEOs in handcuffs and the stock analysts who turned out to be fishier than storefront palm readers , but after a while the laughs came hard . Martha Stewart was dented and scuffed . Tyco was looted by its own executives . Enron and WorldCom turned out to be Twin Towers of false promises . They fell . Their stockholders and employees went down with them . So did a large measure of public faith in big corporations . Each new offense seemed to make the same point : with communism vanquished , capitalism was left with no real enemies but its own worst impulses . It can be undone by its own overreaching players . It can be bitten to pieces by its own alpha dogs . <P> Day after day , one set of misgivings twined around the other , keeping spooked investors away from the stock market , giving the whole year its undeniable saw-toothed edge . Were we headed for a world where all the towers would fall ? All the more reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , how to repair the fail-safe operations  --  in the boardrooms we trusted with our money , at the government agencies we trust with ourselves  --  that failed . <P> This is where three women of ordinary demeanor but exceptional guts and sense come into the picture . Sherron Watkins is the Enron vice president who wrote a letter to chairman Kenneth Lay in the summer of 2001 warning him that the company 's methods of accounting were improper . In January , when a congressional subcommittee investigating Enron 's collapse released that letter , Watkins became a reluctant public figure , and the Year of the Whistle-Blower began . Coleen Rowley is the FBI staff attorney who caused a sensation in May with a memo to FBI Director Robert Mueller about how the bureau brushed off pleas from her Minneapolis , Minn. , field office that Zacarias Moussaoui , who is now indicted as a Sept. 11 co-conspirator , was a man who must be investigated . One month later Cynthia Cooper exploded the bubble that was WorldCom when she informed its board that the company had covered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
