one Kirsten This is lame but I 'm actually looking forward to school this year , because every day this summer was like crap : dog crap , cat crap-I even had a few elephant crap days . Trust me , it was bad . For starters I hardly saw my best friend in the whole world , Rory . She was always in camp or on Maui . They probably do n't even have crap on Maui . Besides Rory being gone all summer , my only other friend in the whole world , Nellie , moved away and my mom and dad fought all the time . They stopped seeing my little sister , Kippy , and me , and they definitely stopped hearing what we said . We even tried a little experiment on them . Kippy said there was a colony of worms living in the laundry hamper and my mom said : " Leave your muddy shoes outside . " And I said Brad Pitt had invited me to a slumber party and my mom said : " You already had your snack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't . But summer is over . School is back . And all I can think about as mymom drives us up to the drop-off is how I really , really , really want to have a bunch of classes with Rory this year . Well , that 's almost all I think of . I also consider my butt and how it will make its way out of our car . Nobody wants to see a gigantor butt coming out of a car first thing on a Monday morning , that much I know . " Have a good day . Eat the lunch I packed . Do n't buy junk . . . , " my mom says when my feet hit the pavement . " Kirsten ! " She unrolls the side window and beckons with her hand . " Do you know that boy , that bla-African American kid ? " Her head cranes toward a guy who just gotout of a red sports car . Tall , nice-looking guy . Shaved head , handsome . . . dresses like he 's the governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The red car pulls out of the drop-off and my mom 's head snaps to the front . She pounces on the accelerator and her car flies forward with the door open and the seat belt clanking the side . She swerves around a big SUV , guns it , then pounces on the brakes , coming to a squealing , screeching halt . The stop sign . Her hand rotates a million miles an hour , gesturing to this poor huddled pedestrian , but the pedestrian wo n't move . He 's afraid . I ca n't blame the guy . . . . I 'd be afraid , too . When my mom sees the man is sticking , she shoots forward again like she 's on the chase . She 's hunting down the red car , going to drive right over it and staple it to the ground . Oh , great : now she 's getting weird in public , too . When I turn to leave , the black kid is standing next to me . " That your mom ? " I nod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to be size three and named Barbie for my giggle . Between my giggle and the extra forty pounds , I 've got to be the coolest girl in the whole seventh grade . " She hits my mom 's car , gon na be trouble . " He shakes his head . " You do n't wan na mess with my mom and that car . " " I 'm sorry . " My face flames so hot I could fry eggs on my cheeks . " That 's a 350Z . We just got it . My mom 's been shining it with her toothbrush . You should see her . " " It 's nice . " I bite my lip . " Very red . " " My mom drives it real careful . She has two speeds . One mile an hour " - he pauses- " and stopped . " I laugh-my real laugh this time . " I thought the police were gon na pull us over for going so slow . Like , hey lady , get outta neutral . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We got ta move ! " he says . " You go . I 'll never make it ! " " Come on , whatever your name is , run , " he shouts over his shoulder . " My name is Kirsten , " I call after him as he thunders ahead taking the stairs two at a time . I try running , even though running makes my fat jiggle . Still , I want to keep up . This guy is nice to me even though my mother nearly creamed a guy in the crosswalk and chased down his mom 's car . My mother . . . I swear . What was that about , anyway ?
