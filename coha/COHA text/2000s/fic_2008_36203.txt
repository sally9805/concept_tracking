Revenge is like any other religion : There 's always a lot more preaching than there is practicing . And most of that preaching is about what not to practice . <br> " Vengeance is mine " translates to : " It 's not yours . " The karma-peddlers will tell you how doing nothing is doing the right thing , reciting , " What goes around comes around , " in that heavy-gravity tone reserved for the kind of ancient wisdom you find in comic books . <br> Every TV " counselor , " every self-help expert , every latte-slurping guru . . . they all chant some version of the same mantra : " Revenge never solves anything . " <br> Their favorite psalm is Forgiveness . And their hymn books are always open to the same page . <br> Get it ? When you crawl away , you 're not being a punk ; you 're just letting the cosmos handle your business . Whoever hurt you , they 'll get theirs , do n't worry . Just have a little faith . <br> Down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count on karma . And you can count on this : hurt one of us , we 're all coming for you . <br> A low-level maggot once got a little taste of power and overdosed on it . He murdered a thirteen-year-old girl after the three privileged little weasels who had started the fun ran to him for help . <br> The boys had n't meant to kill her ; they were good kids who just got a little carried away . All they wanted was to gang-rape the little cock-teaser , take some pictures , and teach her what it cost to humiliate people of their status . But their freakish plan tumbled out of control when the girl suddenly stopped moving . <br> Terrified , they offered the maggot anything he wanted if he 'd dump the body for them . <br> But when he arrived at the abandoned house where they 'd left her , he discovered she was n't dead  --  passed out from the pain , but still breathing , leaking blood . He touched her throat , found a good , strong pulse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have survived . <br> Instead , he went to work on her . His kind of work . <br> The little girl lived a few more minutes . Alive in terror and praying for death . <br> More than thirty years later , the maggot and the three grown-up weasels were all killed . They went out within minutes of each other . <br> We got paid to do that . <br> Now we 're paying . <br> The sniper who had calmly pinned my father to the ground as we were making our getaway is gone , too . An on-target warhead from an RPG had turned the stone-shielded corner he 'd been firing from into an incinerator big enough for him and the rest of the hired guns up there with him . <br> So many died that day . Every time my heart pumps , regret pulses through my bloodstream . <br> That 's the bad thing about killing certain humans : you can only do it once . <br> " What more can we do , mahn ? My father is somewhere between this world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay  --  with those people until he comes back to us . If he were only in a real hospital . . . " <br> " We 've been through this , " I told Clarence . " A thousand times , ever since it happened . You think we can , what , call a city ambulance ? The Prof 's prints would fall like a cinderblock on an egg . They 'd handcuff him to the bed and turn the whole place into a goddamn PBA convention . " <br> " I could  --  " <br> " You ca n't do anything ! " I snapped at him , as sharply as his father would have . <br> " When you were shot  --  " <br> " Your father  --  my father , too , remember ?  --  he made the call then . And he made the right one . This one is n't the same ; the minute we unhook the Prof from those machines , he 's done . This call was on me to make , and I made it . Now we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those doctors  --  " <br> Max pulled at the sleeve of Clarence 's jacket , the same dove-gray cashmere he 'd been wearing the night we dropped the Prof off  --  now it was almost black , darkened with fear . When Clarence looked up , the mute Mongolian made the universal gesture of pointing his finger like a pistol and dropping his thumb like a hammer . Then tapped his temple , and made a facial expression that spoke louder than words . <br> " You think those medical boys do n't fucking know that ? " I echoed . " They 're not worried about some malpractice claim . They 're running an outlaw operation , and they get paid a fortune to take care of people from our world . That 's what we 're paying so much for : not just the care , the risk  --  they 're putting a lot more than their licenses on the line , understand ? That 's why you never threaten people like them  --  they 've heard it all before . It wo n't make them work harder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " But . . . for what they are charging , even with all the money we took from that last . . . thing , we will run out by  --  " <br> " I know , " I said soothingly . " But do n't worry about it , Clarence . We found a new way for us to keep earning . " <br> " Nobody told me  --  " <br> " You had no role to play in this one , son , " I said , channeling the Prof. " Not up till now , anyway . " <br> " Listen to me , sweetheart . " Michelle spoke just above a whisper , her voice the same mystery-blend as her perfume . " Trust me , the word 's out : the Prof 's in the consultant business now . Any serious thief playing for a retirement score would want the Master to check over the plans , make sure there 's no flaw . But they would n't expect a face-to-face . So the Prof 's got a front man for that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islander said , looking over at me and nodding . " But how is that going to bring in the kind of money we  --  ? " <br> " It already is , " I cut him off . " Got more business than we can handle . We 're even ready to have you start working backup , too . If you want . " <br> Clarence opened his mouth to say something , but Max just shook his head . <br> Mama crossed the distance from her register at the front to my booth in the back . Looked us all over . Held Clarence with her eyes . Said , " Movie business very good . Those kind of people , spend money like drunks . " <br> Clarence opened his mouth again , but this time it was Michelle who shut him up . " We 've got a doctor too , baby . A script doctor . Best in the business . The only one who gets his quote and a percentage of the gross . Let 's you and me go over there and sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'll explain it all to you . " <br> The apartment was spacious by New York standards . Three bedrooms , two baths . And on a decent West Side block , too . <br> But this was no luxury co-op . No awning over the front door . No doorman , never mind a concierge . No central air . The elevator only went down : all the way down from a uniformed operator , to **26;1380;TOOLONG , to permanent " Out of Service . " <br> Even the super was part-time . His one qualification was that he 'd done time , and his real job was handling complaints with a " you do n't want to go too far with this " look . <br> Thirty-six units , but only five of them still occupied . The building owner was warehousing the rest , playing stare-down with the remaining owners . No real-estate broker had any of the empty units listed . <br> Some of the holdouts had been stupid enough to try bribing the super . He introduced them to a new dance : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Step two comes when you run into him again  --  a blank look , like he 's never seen you before . <br> When it comes to bribery , citizens are out of their league . Even in this everything-for-sale pesthole of a city , you ca n't run to the cops when the guy you greased does n't do what you paid him for  --  that would be like a loan shark suing you for missing a payment . <br> We paid the super for access to the apartment . Not a bribe : payment for a service . He did n't try his look on us  --  it 's our kind he learned it from . He was n't a genius , but he was smart enough not to confuse us with citizens . <br> The cell phone in the right-hand pocket of my jacket vibrated . My clients were on their way up . . . up the stairs . I nodded to Max . He opened the door just as they were about to push the disconnected buzzer . <br> The doctor was in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing too flashy . I knew the headman by rep only . He may have looked like a pita pocket overstuffed with suet , but if crime was a dance , he had the moves of a tango star . <br> The other two could have been his partners . Or crew members , or undercover cops . The way we had it set up , it did n't make any difference . Any tape they walked away with would be about as useful as a Vietnam body count . <br> My worktable was a rough-hewn slab of wood with fold-up legs . I gestured for them to sit wherever they wanted . Canvas director 's chairs were the only option . <br> Nobody offered to shake hands . As I leaned back , Michelle swiveled over . All they saw was a blonde in a red latex derma-sheath skirt and a padded bra threatening a stretchy top  --  if they even looked high enough up to see the blonde part . She held out a tray of plain glass ashtrays . The guy to the left of the headman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> Michelle snake-hipped her way out of the room , making it clear that they 'd already experienced the full extent of our hospitality . No minibar in this hotel , and the only room service you could order was already in the room . <br> The headman opened a document case , took out some paper and a chrome pen . He cleared his throat , said : <br> " Now , the way we 've got this scripted , the wealthy guy 's seen all the movies , so he would n't rely on any motion-sensor system . He thinks you can blow talcum powder into the room , make all the laser beams show up . " His smile was room-temperature . <br> I consulted the graph-paper pad in front of me . It was cov-ered in tiny , autistic symbols . " So he 's afraid some gymnast in a leotard  --  " <br> " You got it , " the raisin-eyed pile of dough seated across from me agreed . " We 're looking for realism here . Remember , this is an indie production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste on special effects . So  --  what the guy in our script does , he keeps the stuff in a bunker . " <br> " You mean like one of those old-time bomb shelters , or just a safe buried in the ground ? " <br> " Totally fucking nuclear , " the blob said , catching a confirmatory nod from the non-smoker to his right  --  a solidly built guy in his forties who was either too image-conscious to be saying , " Yeah , boss , " in front of strangers , or an undercover still feeling his way . It had been that guy 's call to Mama 's that set this ride in motion , but he was n't the one with the gas money . <br> " You have him living in there ? " I asked the boss . " Inside the bunker , I mean ? " <br> " Nah . But he could , is the point . " <br> " You 're saying , in this script , the way it 's set up , all he has to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , right ? Then he could just kick back in the La-Z-Boy , toss some porno into his DVD player , and sip fine wine until the cops show up ? " <br> " Not cops , " the blob said , with an absolute sureness that meant whatever they intended to snatch was something the victim could n't report to his insurance company . Straight out of the pro thief 's bible : the best thing to steal is stolen property . <br> Continues ...
