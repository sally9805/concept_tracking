Lynne Cheney wo n't play it up , but she 's making feminist history , more so than stay-at-home , stand-by-her-man Hillary Clinton did . Cheney is the very first Second Lady to keep her day job ( and her seat on two corporate boards ) . When she 's in town , Cheney , toting a brown bag with a salad and bottle of water , goes to work at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank , in a boxy building in downtown Washington , where she is currently working on a book about heroic American women . <P> When she gets there , or anywhere else these days , Cheney is a lot more subdued than she used to be . Far from being " hard to muzzle " as Bill Bennett predicted when her husband was selected as Veep , Cheney has voluntarily relinquished leading the posse in the cultural wars . As head of the National Endowment for the Humanities , she fought against educational softheads veering away from traditional curriculums , denounced rap lyrics ( that means you , Eminem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crossfire Sunday , she shouted down liberals on subjects ranging from trigger locks ( against them ) to fur coats ( for them ) . Before that , she wrote several books , not only about education and cultural relativism but also a novel featuring two women in love , and she co-wrote another about a Vice President who dies flagrante delicto . In a you-go-girl ending , his smart , cheated-upon wife takes his job . Briefly , Cheney toyed with running for the Senate . <P> Sitting down at home on a pristine white chair , she lets her two large Labradors cover her and the furniture with dog hair as they wrestle at her feet . When it 's pointed out that some people might miss the old Lynne Cheney who knew how to stir up a little trouble , she says how happy she is with her new life and what a relief it is " not to have to have an opinion about everything . " <P> Pundit fatigue : rarely seen inside the Beltway . Too bad the only known cure is being married to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , she dropped a controversial book project on academia in favor of writing one for children , America : A Patriotic Primer ( " A is for America , the land that we love ; B is for the Birthday of this nation of ours " ) . Scribbled in the margins of newspapers during the 2000 campaign , it 's as uncontroversial as you can get , although , no doubt , a few colleagues from her old life would find " N is for Native Americans " a squishy nod to multiculturalism . <P> Being a think-tank fellow and a Second Lady are flex-time jobs that allow Cheney to scoop up from school the three daughters of her daughter Liz , a lawyer at the State Department . ( Daughter Mary just got her M.B.A . and is on the board of the Republican Unity Coalition , which seeks to build bridges between gay and straight g.o.p. - ers . ) Lynne brings her granddaughters back to the mansion , which has been redone to a fare-thee-well in beige and ecru . Next to the huge , stark Frankenthaler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried roses that only an adult could love , the kids ' stash of Huffy bikes , Hula-Hoops and an electric Barbie car in the corner provide the decorating touch money ca n't buy .
