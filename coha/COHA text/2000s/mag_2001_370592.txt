There are things in the world that never change : gravity , the sine rule , your mother 's opinion of your spouse . And then there are things that last just an instant : a dance , a meal , Heath Ledger 's career . Fashion belongs squarely in the latter category . To do fashion well , one has to master the momentary , to catch time in a bottle green , double-faced cashmere maxicoat . This is almost harder than making something timeless , because as the moment changes , so must the designer , and he must understand each bank and shoal of time equally well . " The moment of a great dress is a moment , " Tom Ford has said . " Not even a week or a month . It 's gone at the end of a party . " <P> Ford , 39 , born in Texas , raised in New Mexico and aged in New York City and Europe , has been on the whitecap of  --  or indeed , his splashes have created  --  just about every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the show that brought about a rapprochement between the stylish and the ' 70s , reacquainting humanity with velvet hip huggers and satin shirts in a way that allowed us to see an inner beauty or relevance we had somehow overlooked for nigh on two decades . Ford gave that silhouette 's androgyny a new spark , suggesting that being located somewhere on a male-female continuum rather than in one gender camp opens up more possibilities . <P> Ambiguity and transience are perhaps Ford 's chief assets as a designer . He wo n't be nailed down to one look , one sex , one cut or even one couture house  --  at least not for long . He 's an American whose vision glares over one of the largest European fashion empires . As creative director of Gucci Group , he designs eight collections a year ( for Gucci in London and YSL Rive Gauche in Paris ) , plus their cash cows , the accessories , shuttling between the two ateliers on the Eurostar . He also oversees the design of new stores and the ad campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which include YSL Beaute , Bottega Veneta , Boucheron and Sergio Rossi . There is no part of the fashion business he finds dull . " For me fashion does n't stop at clothes , " says Ford . " Fashion is everything . Art , music , furniture design , graphic design , hair , makeup , architecture , the way cars look  --  all those things go together to make a moment in time , and that 's what excites me . " <P> His entrepreneurship smacks to some in the fashion industry of a lack of commitment to design or a harbinger of a regrettable Americanization of European houses . But Ford is unapologetic . " I 'm always perplexed by people wanting to divide this into business and fashion , " he says . " My job is to create something amazing that sells . I do n't think you can divorce the two .
