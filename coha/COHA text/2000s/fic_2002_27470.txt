Thirty-Year-Old Women Do Not Always Come Home Bowling was n't what it used to be and neither was Harry Kreevich . Once , the pro bowling tour got good ratings , tape-delayed , Saturdays on network television ; back then , Harry 's place , Cuyahoga Lanes , hosted important events . The great Nelson Burton Jr . once bowled a 300 game there . Harry considered him a personal friend . But Burton retired . So did the great Earl Anthony . There were no more giants in the sport . Tour events moved to newer facilities . As bowling 's TV ratings dwindled , so did Harry . His wife Anna , whom Harry had loved until the end but who had been , in Harry 's opinion , frigid , bought a book about masturbation called Women : Selfloving , and left him . His older daughter Debra , the painter , moved to New York and married a creep . His younger daughter Jane spent ten years in college and finished with an unfinished Ph.D . in English and no discernible skills , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alley . To his surprise , Jane turned out to be a frugal , careful manager . Theft went down . Profits rose . Harry began to date . No one special , but it was a start . Things started looking up . Then the new lane girl disappeared . She had reminded Harry of Debra , though not in the looks or personality departments . The lane girl was a big midwesterner with a husky voice and white , American teeth , plus long thick legs and a stunning amount of blond hair , styled in a way that screamed Parmatown Mall ! Debra , like her mother , was dark , thin , smart , and pretty , with a lone shock of white hair that arrived , overnight , in her late twenties . But both Debra and the lane girl had the pout . When Harry told the lane girl she was hired but , sorry , he had a policy against pay advances , boom ! Debra 's pout . Lower lip barely stuck out , eyes blinking only twice . Harry gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit on an apartment ) on the condition that she please not mention it to Jane . For two weeks , Harry had the lane girl of his dreams : smiling , quick , graceful with the drunks . Anything went wrong with an order , she flashed the customers the pout , and boom ! all was well . She hit it off with Ray , the bartender , who was black and seemed honest but was hard to get to know . ( Ray had been there a year ; about all Harry knew was that he was pursuing a teaching degree at a pricey Catholic school on the east side . ) The new lane girl made enough tips on just two league nights to pay Harry back . But on the day of her first payday , she did n't show up . At first , Harry just thought she was late . Who misses work on payday ? An hour passed . A senior citizens group from Rocky River began to arrive . " We 're about to be butt-slammed , Dad , " said Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter . " Where 's the new girl , what's-her-face ? " " Karen , " said Ray , overhearing . " She has a name . Karen . " He sat in front of the bar . He was reading a library book by someone with an Asian name . The dining lounge was empty . " Can someone call Karen ? " she said . " Dad ? " Harry went to his office . The number on the lane girl 's employment application was in Cleveland Heights . The phone had been disconnected . No further information , a voice said , about this number . " Any minute , probably , " Harry told Jane , " she will be here . " Cuyahoga Lanes was filling up with old people , tottering in , lugging their own shoes and balls . Last of an era . The average American home , Harry had read in a trade magazine , no longer contained a bowling ball . Harry decided to wait the tables himself . The seniors did n't order much . When they did , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-fat chips , but he 'll look into it . No veggie burgers . No soy milk . Sorry . The seniors went home sharply at nine . For the next two hours , the alley was dead except in lane eight , where three young men in goatees and polo shirts were getting noisily drunk . Ray asked Jane if she 'd talked to Karen . " Yesterday at work , " she said . " But we did n't really talk talk . " " Does anyone know where she lives ? " Harry asked . " God knows , " said Ray . " But I do n't . " He sang : " ' That 's the difference between God and me . ' " Jane found this very funny . Harry did n't know the song . " What do we know about her ? " Harry asked . " Boyfriends and whatnot . What , " he said , looking at Jane , " do the women know ? " " Oh , Daddy , " Jane said . " You 're so cute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even remember Karen 's name . Harry called his other lane girl , a married young redhead named Maureen . A baby wailed in the background . " Sorry , Mr. K , " Maureen said . " She and I never said more'n hi and bye . " Jane and Ray told screw-in-a-lightbulb jokes for a half hour . Then she said he could go home . At eleven , Harry ushered out the college boys , making sure they returned their shoes . The janitors arrived , a fiftyish Mexican couple . The only conversation Jacinto and Luisa remembered having with Karen concerned Elvis . She felt many of Elvis 's movies were underrated . Luisa agreed ; Jacinto disagreed . " All crap , " he said . " Every one . " Luisa elbowed him , and he chuckled . " Our first date , " Jacinto said , " it was Girl Happy . " Jane closed out the register , and Jacinto let Harry and Jane out the locked side door . As they crossed the parking lot , Jane waved the canvas bank-deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Dad , " Jane said . " Maybe something 's wrong . " " Probably it 's nothing , " said Harry . " Do n't worry . " Two days later , Harry flew to New York to see Debra . She had an opening in what she called a small , influential gallery , in a warehouse in TriBeCa . " Brace yourself , Dad , " Debra had said on the phone . " My new work is a real leap from my old work . " " What am I , a philistine ? " he said . " Artists are supposed to make leaps . " " Mom was shocked . " " Your mother is n't me . " He was hurt Anna had seen the paintings first . Harry was a Sunday painter . He painted scenes on old saws , scenes of old farm women , wagons , scythes , frolicsome boys and girls in fields of grain : images of his childhood in Croatia . His family had emigrated in 1947 , when Harry was eight . Things had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only imagine . He would n't have the heart to go back . He painted the pictures in his mind . He knew it was n't really art , like what Debra did . Debra had training , the best schools . She 'd been written up in New Art Examiner . She 'd won a grant from the United States government . Still , Harry was proud that , each June , when he set up a tent at a craft fair , his saws sold briskly . The gallery was in the basement of the warehouse , and the opening did not begin until 11 P.M. Beforehand , he , Debra , and her husband-the-creep had dinner upstairs , in a restaurant owned by three famous actors Harry had never heard of . Today there were so many new stars . Too many . " When was your mother here ? " Harry asked . The pointlessly huge tables forced diners almost to shout . " Last month , " said the creep . He did that , answered for her . " She and Jack were en route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new husband . " A layover . " " Paris , " Harry said . " Huh . " The creep , Eric , a record executive , told a tiresome story about Parisian rock music . He was tall , with a high voice , and had never , in Harry 's opinion , taken Debra seriously as a painter . In their apartment , Eric had a home office and a fitness room . Debra was forced to share studio space in a part of Brooklyn where she 'd been mugged twice . Dinner was served before Harry had an opening . " So , " he said , " what 's shocking about your work ? " " You 'll see , " said Eric . " Man , will you see . " " Maybe my daughter would like to answer . " " I 'm right here , Daddy , " she said . " No need to call me ' my daughter ' with me right here . " Harry nodded , in concession . " A year ago , " Debra said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things I liked about my work and all the things I did n't . " " Good idea , " said Harry . Harry was a list-maker . " What I liked was the light and the space , " she said . " I did n't like how austere my work was . How serious . " " Not too serious , I never thought . " She had been doing odd still lifes-bowls of fruit and cheap toys , with dozens of TV sets in the background . Harry loved them . " But to grow is important . " " Well , I 'm doing nudes now . " " So ? " said Harry . His stomach lurched . " There is a long tradition , nudes . " " Mom was shocked . " " Enough already with your mother . " The check came while Debra was in the bathroom . The waiter left it near Eric , who looked away , as if forgiving a rudeness . The table was so large , Harry could not reach for it . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eric frowned . " This ? " He picked it up and looked at the total . " I got it , " he said . " When we 're in Cleveland , you can get it . " Harry gamely protested . Eric-though he was in the music business , and Cleveland now had the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ( of which Harry was proud , and kept meaning to visit ) - was the sort of man who bragged about never having set foot in Cleveland . Debra took them downstairs for an early preview . Two young women were setting out wines and adjusting the lighting . The nudes were penises . Close-up , painted in shades of gray . Erect and limp , all races , circumcised and not , dangling from squatting positions , fat men and thin . One penis was so alarmingly small , Harry wondered if it was a freak . The paint was thick , purposefully cracked . " People you know ? " Harry said , trying to sound cosmopolitan . " Models , " Debra said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped their self-esteem . " Harry did not want to know how . " There has n't been as much done with the penis , " she said , " especially by women . " She laughed . " Women painters . " The laugh put Harry at ease . " Right , " he said . To his surprise , he found himself able to study the paintings , with appreciation . It was not what he 'd hang at the alley ( which featured four of Harry 's saws , two of Debra 's still lifes , six posters of Cleveland sports figures , and an aerial photo of the city he 'd bought at the Cleveland bicentennial celebration ) . Still , though he did n't have the training to explain what impressed him , his instincts were that this would help Debra make a name for herself . The penis , Harry thought , truly is a sad , slouchy little guy . " This work is amazing , sweetheart . " " That one 's mine , " said Eric the creep , pointing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of small paintings in which a penis was half inserted into different sorts of fruit , citrus and otherwise . Harry felt sick and must have looked it ; when he made eye contact with Debra , there it was : the pout . " A strange thing happened at the alley , " Harry blurted . " A lane girl disappeared . " " Disappeared ? " said Debra . " A ' lane girl ' ? " said Eric , amused . " She did n't come in to pick up her paycheck . She 'd only been there two weeks . " " People disappear all the time , " Eric said . " Who knows what kind of bug-out she 's having . Believe me , she 'll turn up . " " How do you know ? " asked Harry . " Did you ever know anyone who disappeared ? " " As a matter of fact , " Eric said , " yes . I used to volunteer as a counselor at Jewish Social Services . You 'd be surprised how many Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ? " " Three . " " Is she Jewish ? " Eric said . " Why ? " " Curious . " Eric shrugged . " It 's illegal to ask that , " Harry said . " She 'll come back , " Eric said . " It 's about love , drugs , or alcohol . Unless it 's a psychotic episode . " " A psychotic episode , " said Harry . " How comforting . " " I 've always loved his accent , " Eric said to Debra . " Almost Jewish , but not . Is n't it great ? " " I am right here . " Harry did not think he had an accent . " No need to talk like I 'm not . " Eric looked at him , blankly . " Well , " he said . " Okay . " At eleven , the place was still empty . Five or six people . " New Yorkers , " Eric said . " We 're always late . " It pained Harry to hope Eric was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sheet listing the titles and prices . Harry was afraid no one would pay so much for work like this , no matter how accomplished . Across the gallery were two men ( one taking notes ) , both dressed in loose-fitting suits that Harry supposed cost as much as a nice used Plymouth . They had Debra cornered and were effusively interpreting her own paintings for her . Debra nodded at everything they said . She made eye contact with Harry . Her forced smile widened and turned genuine . Harry felt blessed . By midnight , Harry was exhausted and ready to go back to his hotel . Suddenly , as if there had arrived out front a bus full of affected undertakers ( so much black ! ) , the crowd arrived . The young women who 'd set out the wine began to affix red dots to the laminated title cards beside some of the paintings . Did this mean a sale ? Harry never saw money change hands . " The red dot means a sale , " Eric stage-whispered to Harry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " More dots went up . Harry felt guilty . The artist 's father should buy something . He made a lap of the gallery and chose a piece that focused on the model 's thigh . Harry thought it might only be on second glance that you 'd notice the painting had a penis in it . He slipped a check to the woman pouring wine . She pointed to another woman . " For Study Number Thirty-seven , " Harry said to that woman . " Ship to the address on the check , please . Mark down the sale as ' Anonymous . ' " Harry sought Debra out . " I 'm beat , " he said . " I know you have to stay until the bitter end . I 'll take a cab and see you in the morning , for breakfast . " Again , the quick pout . Again , he thought of the lane girl . " Okay , Daddy , " she whispered . " It meant so much to have your friendly face here . This is so weird . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel apart from it , too . Like being a bride . " " You are a beautiful bride , " Harry said . " You have made good work . Be proud . " " I am , " she said , " now . Coming from you , it means something . " Harry arrived at Hopkins Airport late the next night . Jane was n't there . He called home , got no answer , waited an hour , then took a taxi . His house was dark . Jane 's new red Jeep was gone from the carport . Harry headed up the porch steps , sweating in the cool darkness . He flicked on the lights , saw the legal pad on the kitchen table . A ransom note , he was sure , asking for money in exchange for the lane girl and now Jane . Harry had been robbed six times at work . He knew about crime . He was wrong . It was from Jane . Harry had forgotten to give her his itinerary . She apologized for not being there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a PS , she wrote that she 'd be out late and not to worry . He said , " Ha ! " He said it very loud . Harry filled a metal iced-tea tumbler with ice and vodka . He turned on a television set but did not even look at it . He went to his basement workbench and spent two hours painting a saw with a beach scene from Split . It brimmed with safe children and blue water . In the morning , Jane 's bed was undisturbed . She had not come home . She did not always come home . She was thirty . Thirty-year-old women did not always come home . He had to accept that . Harry went in early to work . When Jane arrived , she came straight to the office and bluntly told him she was moving in with Ray the bartender . They had , apparently overnight , fallen in love , though Jane claimed they had been dating for weeks ; how could Harry not know ? Harry did not know . Harry had no idea . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Karen . " " I called information , " Jane said , defensively . " No listing . So I called the in-case-of-emergency number on her job application . " Why had n't Harry thought of that ? " And ? " " And nothing , " said Jane . " It was long distance . Las Vegas . I kept leaving messages on a machine-maybe six calls total-but nobody ever called back . What can you do ? The message on the machine was a hair-metal song . No ' please leave a message ' or ' wait for the beep . ' Hair metal . " Jane disapproved of this hair metal , which pleased Harry , even though he had not heard the term before and could only imagine what sort of music it codified . " I 'm calling the police , " he said . " Daddy , " she said . " Please . She 's got her story , and one day she 'll come get her check and tell us what happened . Either that or she wo n't . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer guy come in ? " " He just left . I paid him cash . We 're square . " " Did you get a receipt ? " she said . " I ca n't believe you pay those guys cash . " Harry had read an article in the Plain Dealer that said the world would do away with cash by the year 2010 , which , Harry was afraid , he would live to see . Harry Kreevich was a man worth about half a million dollars who did not have an ATM card . He liked talking to the tellers . Ray came into the office now and asked to use the phone . He told Jane he was going to order a new , larger bed from a toll-free number . You could do that now . A bed ! Same-day delivery . " Go ahead , " Harry said . " I suppose congratulations are in order . " Ray looked confused for a moment . " Oh , right , " he said . " I got you . Thanks , Harry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching past Ray , opening his desk drawer , pulling out the beer man 's receipt , waving it at Jane . " I am not a fool , you know . " Jane laughed . She was a washed-out version of her sister . Book-smart , more sure of herself . " I know , Daddy . I 'm sorry . " They set up shop . Saturday : teen leagues , with one-tenth the kids they had when Jane and Debra were girls . Jane put cash into the register at the counter , Harry into the one at the bar . They made eye contact . " So ? " Jane said , hopefully . She used her head to point inefficiently toward Ray . " So your sister is painting penises . " He said it a little loud , and flinched . " I know , " Jane said . " She sends me slides . They 're good . Less austere than her old work . " Everyone , it seemed , knew everything that came as news to Harry Kreevich . " I bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Harry said . " Pay attention , young girl in love . " At this , Jane smiled . She had a pretty smile . She should smile more . " I bought a painting , " Harry said . " One of Debra 's . " Ray emerged from the office . " Done , " he called , to both of them . Done with the office , done ordering their bed . " How ' bout that Tribe , eh , Harry ? " " This may be the year , " said Harry . He was not a baseball fan , but everyone in Cleveland was saying this may be the year . They had been saying this for several years now . " I ca n't wait to see it , " Jane said . " Debra 's painting . " " They 're shipping it , " he said . " When are you moving ? " " Tonight , " she said . " At least get a start on it . " Harry bit his tongue so he would n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Harry , pushing the cash register closed , " is as good a night as any . No time like the present . " What time would want to be like the present , that was what Harry Kreevich wanted to know . Once , he believed in the American Dream . He started as a pin boy at Erieview Lanes in the Slavic Village . He worked his way up until he was made assistant manager . He married Anna , the actual girl next door . They scraped and saved . They took his immigrant father 's life insurance policy from the steel mill and paid cash for their own , new alley . It was in the west suburbs . Like true Americans , Harry and Anna Kreevich progressed westward . They ran the alley together , had two lovely daughters , and built a house in Bay Village , four blocks from the lake . Harry was raised to believe American lives were arcs of progress , all trends generally up . That 's how it was , until it was n't . When did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been that way for a while . He felt that way a long time before Anna left . Maybe it was all Ronald Reagan 's fault . ( Harry , a little drunk , said this to a nice lady realtor he dated a few times . It scared her off . Realtors liked Reagan . ) Harry had modernized , computerized , expanded , made the Brunswick sales rep rich . But the pro bowling tour went elsewhere . Nelson Burton died . Anna was in Paris with her lawyer husband , diddling herself . Harry once asked Anna if he could watch her do that ; she was shocked . Now , Harry was reduced to dating tired-looking divorces he met from the personal ads they placed in the Plain Dealer . This was not progress . Cleveland was booming and , according to what everybody said , no longer a joke to the rest of the world . But if you asked Harry , the rest of the world did n't know crap . The old Cleveland was a great American city , where his father worked hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a place where all that people made was fancy food , public drinking , and play . Ask someone why Cleveland is booming and they will say , " Look at the downtown restaurants and all that neon in the Flats and also the tax-abated playground for millionaires where the Cleveland Indians play . " Or they will mention the revived theater district . Or the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Food , drink , and , most important of all , play . Harry liked all of these things , and he should talk , making his living off people eating popcorn , drinking beer , and bowling . But this was nothing to build a city on . Nothing to build a society on . What were people thinking ? Where would all this lead ? That 's what Harry Kreevich wanted to know . His late-night theories were " nothing " and " nowhere . " Harry , not yet sixty , felt spent . Balding , paunchy , divorced . Told by his doctor to exercise , he took long walks , alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how lately she 'd made things better-that had to be temporary . Harry had hired the perfect lane girl , and what happened ? She disappeared . Of course . For a woman who 'd never had a full-time job for longer than a year , Jane was rich with things . The books ! Hundreds of them , alphabetized on white laminated shelves she 'd assembled herself . Ray had a truck , and all Jane was taking was what would fit in two trips : her summer clothes , half her books ( many liquor boxes full ) , and all her rock music compact discs . Except for four of the bookshelves , her furniture stayed . " I 'm going to take a quick look , " Jane said , " for any last-minute whatevers . " They were nearly finished loading up for the second trip . Ray owned a duplex he was renovating himself , in Tremont . That used to be a rough place . Jane said it was coming up in the world . Harry had n't been there in years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truck was full . " Why is it , " Harry said , " people pick the hottest day of the year to move ? " It was in fact only a run-of-the-mill hot day . Harry just wanted to say something . He and Ray had done most of this work without saying more than your side first and easy . " Just say it , Harry , " Ray said . " I know you 're thinking it . " " Thinking what ? " But Harry knew what Ray meant . " C'm on , " said Ray . " I 'd be thinking it if I were you . " Harry shrugged . " It 's a new millennium , right ? " " Your grandkids would be black . That 's how it is , in America . How are you with that ? " " Is she pregnant ? " " No , " Ray said . " I love my daughters , " Harry said . " I hope I live long enough , they will give me grandbabies to spoil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set on a shady flagstone . " Does that answer your question ? " Ray considered this . He finished his beer . He patted Harry on the back and laughed . " They got others back in Croatia like you ? " " I do n't know , " Harry said . " I left when I was ten years old . I have n't been back since . " Just then , with Ray 's arm still around Harry , Jane came down the porch steps carrying Harry 's VCR and one of Debra 's still lifes . She had n't asked to take these , but Harry did n't say anything . " My two guys ! " she said . " Let me take a picture . " But her camera-which Harry gave her last Christmas , his first year of shopping alone for the girls-would not work . Dating made Harry Kreevich think of death . Even on first dates , women talked about diet taboos , or brushes with breast cancer , or how their parents were racked with Alzheimer 's . Yet Harry resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young girlfriend to the foolish accoutrements : red sports car , hairpiece , lifetime membership at a Vic Tanny health club . He had spoken twice on the phone with this new woman , Beverly , who was in public relations , and they had met once downtown , for coffee . This was how it was done , from those ads . Neutral spots first . If things work out , you make a date . Harry always let the woman pick a place . He wanted them to see he was not the kind of man who had to make all the decisions . Eat , drink , and maybe someday play . Harry was trying to build something with this frivolity , but what , exactly , he did n't have words for . Companionship is too sad a word , and wrong . Not love , either . Love was too simple and too complicated a word for the word Harry did not have . Beverly lived in Chagrin Falls , so far on the east side , it was n't Cleveland anymore . She picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's drive for Harry , plus another half-hour when he got lost . Before he set foot in the place , Harry had decided that dating this woman was pure folly . Inside , the place looked like a hunting lodge designed by someone who disapproved of hunting . Nothing on the menu was less than twenty-two dollars . For most of the meal , Beverly was charming . She and Harry reminisced like old friends about the baffling miracle of parenthood ( Beverly had four sons ) , the surprising , inevitable ways children turn out . They talked about music that even oldies stations never played and movie stars no one talked about anymore . Stewart Granger . Olivia DeHaviland . Ida Lupino . " All dead , probably , " Harry said . He winced . Sure enough , as they finished dinner , Beverly told him one son was dying of AIDS . She began to cry . Other diners stared . They think we 're married , he thought . They think I 've hurt her . The waiter , sadistically , kept refilling her coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked her to her car and said he had to get up early the next morning . It was barely dark . They shook hands , and he was back in his car , pointing its hood ornament west . Harry got onto I-480 . He told himself that when the Lee Road exit came up , he might not take it . He 'd scribbled the lane girl 's old address on one of his own business cards . He 'd made sure he had his Cuyahoga County street map . Yet he still thought maybe he would n't go . In truth , he 'd thought about the lane girl all night , half listening as Beverly wondered whatever happened to Prez Prado . He went . Lee Road , though it served as what Harry would call a main drag , was one of those streets that went from two lanes to one , back to two , then to an ambiguous width that was more than one and less than two : a street created as if no one but people who lived nearby would ever drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impatient natives , until finally there it was , Sycamore Road . Harry overshot it , turned around , and was almost clipped by a BMW blaring rap music . The street was a single quarter-mile block . Big trees and nice-enough houses . But even in the waning light , Harry could tell-shabby lawns , sagging porches-that this part of town had gone to rentals . The lane girl 's old house was an up-down duplex , an ugly frame house painted a shade of dull blue popular in 1970s bathroom fixtures . The address did n't say up or down , so Harry started with the down . A young black woman answered the door . She was dressed in an untucked security-cop uniform and carrying a sleeping baby . " Do you know a Karen Borkowski ? " Harry whispered . " We just moved in , " the woman said . " Do n't know anybody . " She excused herself and closed the door . He could hear the noise of a television from upstairs . He rang the other doorbell , waited , rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw in the stairwell a shirtless white man , built like a football player gone badly to seed and to beer . " Do you know a Karen Borkowski ? " Harry said . " I know the Karen Borkowski , " the man said . " Who are you ? " " She works for me . I own a bowling alley . " Harry pulled out his card . " She 's missed work . I 'm concerned . " " And you drove all the way over here ? " the man said . " You must be a great boss . Got any openings ? " " No , " Harry said . " Unless you want to wait tables . " " Kiddin ' , chief . I own this house , those two there , plus two more in Shaker . Keeps me as busy as I care to be . Name 's Parker . " The men shook hands . " Karen lived downstairs . She and my fiance , Holly . They had a falling-out . Holly moved up with me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona someplace . " " Nevada , I think , " Harry said . " Whatever , " said Parker . " Karen 's a good egg . I never saw what made Holly and her get on each other 's nerves . That 's how it is with chicks . Try to figure it out , you 'll go nuts . Am I right ? " " Right . " It was the only thing to say . " Maybe your fiance would know where Karen is . " " Sorry , Harry . " Of course this was the sort of young man who would presume familiarity . " Holly 's in the hospital . Broke her leg last night . Stepped in a bucket . If she 's got any ideas , I 'll have her call you . " " No boyfriends ? " Harry persisted . " Or " - he almost said psychotic episodes- " problems ? " " Not that I know of , " Parker said . " She was a regular girl . But like I said , I 'll have Holly call- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - if she knows anything , " Parker said . " Look , it 's nice of you to worry about your waitress , but I got chow nukin ' in the mike . " Food cooking in the microwave , Harry finally figured out , but by then he was alone on the dark porch . He had an odd impulse to leave his Ford parked at the curb and set off on foot , to walk and walk , for days and days , until he got to a place where no one knew him , no one cared where he came from . And so he started walking . Six blocks later , he stopped at a Dairy Mart and bought cigarettes . He had not smoked in twenty years . He crossed the street to Cain Park , where he 'd once taken part in a craft show . In the distance , in an outdoor theater , a man with a guitar was giving a concert . " You must be Daddy 's little pumpkin , " the man sang . That ca n't be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear . It 's the same in painting , Debra once said . People see what they want to . An artist leaves room for people to believe what the artist would never dream of . Harry 's saws meant what Harry meant them to-no more , no less . He sat on a park bench and listened to the music and smoked four cigarettes , then threw the rest in a trash can , walked back to his car , got in , and drove to Bay Village in silence . He was in the garage before he noticed his radio had been meticulously stolen , no dangling wires or broken dash , as if the thief knew he had all the time in the world . Harry showered and shaved , which nowadays men did in the morning . But Harry , like his father , had a light beard and was a nighttime shaver . Where are you , Karen Borkowski , he thought as lay himself down to sleep , and what is the meaning of this ? In the mystery novels Anna read , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become an amateur sleuth . He would solve the crime ; solving the crime would solve much else . So much else ! But this was not one of those improbable , exciting books . There may or may not have been a crime . Harry might never know what happened . He would not discover in his ordinary self an extraordinary gift for sleuthing . He would solve nothing . Accepting that , Harry realized , was its own , small solution . He got out of bed , filled his largest aluminum tumbler full of vodka and iced tea and went downstairs . He spread out his painting things and a great old barn saw he 'd found at a junk store way out in Elyria . He stared at his supplies . He felt like painting , but he did not know what to paint . He finished his drink , made another , stronger one , then came back downstairs and got to work before he could catch himself thinking . He found himself painting women . All dressed in white robes . One was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Virgin Mary and one was his mother , who was a store clerk and a saint , too , and had died ten years ago from diabetes-triggered complications . Harry did not like to think of that . He did them all fast . There was so much space , on that long saw , for more figures . He stopped . He was sweating , more than he had when he was helping Jane move . He was drenched . He looked at what he had done . Terrible . They were terrible . All four women looked exactly alike . None looked like herself . To Harry 's relief , none looked like the lane girl . They all looked like a cartoon character , a famous one . Harry could n't think of her name . He took out the turpentine and wiped the saw clean . With this , Harry Kreevich went upstairs and fell asleep , alone in a king-sized bed , alone in a big dark house , surrounded by the cast-off belongings of his lost wife and two lost daughters-that and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept the sleep of the dead . When he woke up , he was stark naked , which was not the way he usually slept . Stranger yet , the clean , turpentine-smelling saw was in his bed , though he did not remember bringing it with him . For no reason he could think of , it comforted him . He ran his hand along the saw 's smooth surface . The television was still on . It was Sunday morning . Protestants were singing a hymn Harry did n't know . I should go to Mass , he thought , which he had n't done since Christmas . He ran his index finger along the teeth of the saw , daring himself to cut himself . His plump fingers pillowed out and whitened from the pressure . Harry did not cut himself . He broke out laughing . Someone watching this might have mistaken it for crying . But there was no one to watch , about which Harry was awake enough to be glad . So Harry Kreevich 's opinion is the one that counts . Call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the bar together , and the dining lounge was busy , who knew why , when the top story on the TV news reported that a body of a young woman had washed up on the shore of Lake Erie , near a popular tine-smelling saw was in his bed , though he did not remember bringing it with him . For no reason he could think of , it comforted him . He ran his hand along the saw 's smooth surface . The television was still on . It was Sunday morning . Protestants were singing a hymn Harry did n't know . I should go to Mass , he thought , which he had n't done since Christmas . He ran his index finger along the teeth of the saw , daring himself to cut himself . His plump fingers pillowed out and whitened from the pressure . Harry did not cut himself . He broke out laughing . Someone watching this might have mistaken it for crying . But there was no one to watch , about which Harry was awake enough to be glad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Call it laughter . A week later , Harry and Ray were behind the bar together , and the dining lounge was busy , who knew why , when the top story on the TV news reported that a body of a young woman had washed up on the shore of Lake Erie , near a popular seafood restaurant . Whenever TV people have footage of paramedics pulling a dead white girl out of a scenic place , they will make it a big story . " Jesus , " Harry said . " Oh , no . " " Easy , " said Ray . " It could be anybody . " That was hardly a comforting thought . They called for Jane . By the time she got there , the news had progressed to the gruesome ends of other lives . Still it was Jane who took control , who called the TV station and also the cops for details . It was not the lane girl . ( Harry felt both relieved and disappointed . ) The dead girl was a college kid whose boyfriend had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boyfriend shot her and threw her in the lake . He proclaimed his innocence . " I do n't believe you , " Harry angrily said to the TV above the bar . Six days later , the boyfriend confessed . " Good call , Harry , " Ray said . " Thank you . " Harry was beginning to really like this Ray . He was truly happy when Jane and Ray got engaged . He was even happier , a few months later , when they were married , and he gave Jane away , and at the reception , Debra and Eric announced that they were going to have a baby . After the grandbaby was born-a girl , Sara Jane-Eric turned out to be a patient , talented father . Even Eric was something Harry was getting used to . Parker 's fiance never called . And since Harry did not get Parker 's number and was unwilling to drive back to Cleveland Heights , that was that . Off and on , Harry tried the number in Las Vegas . Always the answering machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one ever called back . Harry looked for the lane girl 's face in shopping malls and crowded places like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , which he eventually visited ( hair metal , he learned , had been big in the 1980s ) , but he never saw her . He gradually forgot what she looked like . He stopped calling the number in Las Vegas . He threw away her paycheck . But for the rest of his life , when he picked up a telephone and heard a click , he would wonder if that had been her . As for Debra 's painting , Study #37 : When it arrived , Harry took it to a frame store in Parmatown Mall , where a nice young man suggested different frames and mats and had the good manners not to say anything untoward . Harry picked it up a week later . He hung it on his family room wall . When different women came over , it proved to be quite the conversation piece . " What I like about it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and also how it is not austere . " Someday , he was sure , a woman would hear him say that , and hear how he said it . Someday , someone would hear what it was Harry Kreevich was really trying to say .
