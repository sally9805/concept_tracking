Investigations following the Sept. 11 attacks demonstrated that cooperation between national intelligence agencies is vital in battling global terror . Yet French antiterrorism officials complain that they are being shut out by their U.S. counterparts . " We 're expected to turn over everything we turn up , but our requests for information fall on deaf ears , " says a senior French antiterrorism official . <P> Case in point : the refusal by the U.S. to relay information provided by French al-Qaeda suspects held at Guantanamo Bay . " First the Americans said they could n't transfer evidence obtained outside U.S. territory , " said the official . " Then they said because Guantanamo is a military base , it 's the Defense Department 's decision  --  and that the Defense Department ( DOD ) considers it top secret . It 's a joke . " Both the DOD and the CIA refused comment . <P> The French acknowledge that vital information is getting through via backdoor channels . But they want a more official , two-way street . " If the Americans wo n't play ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now we all stand to lose . "  --  By Bruce Crumley
