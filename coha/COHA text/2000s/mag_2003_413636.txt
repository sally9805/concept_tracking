This elegant cruiser was introduced to the press with a theatrical presentation that would have done justice to Barnum 's best . While the dignitaries and executives were oohing and ahhing on the dock and the PR types were handing out brochures with complimentary bottles of designer water , guess where the boat guys were ? The marine writers , with their scuffed deck shoes and dog-eared notebooks , were all grooving on a little switch in the cockpit . Flip it and the aft center section of the foredeck hinges up and the middle of the boat 's big , curved windshield disappears into it ; then the hatch closes and all is as before  --  except now the windshield is a walk-through . How to get to it ? By using the teak-planked ladder that 's permanently attached to the companionway door , of course . Slide the door shut , unfold the ladder and voil  --  instant access . Was this feature a big deal ? By itself , maybe not , but when added to all the other design innovations on Doral 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch of this new express cruiser . Just a few years ago , Doral came out with a 25-footer , and that boat was a jump up for a Canadian company that had made its mark with fast , snazzy sportboats and small cruisers . Then , in rapid succession , came a 30 , 33 and 36  --  which quickly became a benchmark for cruisers in its class . With the Alegria , Doral has debuted a thoroughly sophisticated and sleek design that takes all of the company 's boatbuilding know-how and ratchets it up into the big leagues . Now back to that windshield . You wo n't see too many walk-through types on boats hitting the 45-foot mark . That 's because access can be tough  --  consoles on boats this size are bigger and harder to clamber up . And heavy shields have to be un-latched and swung out . Passengers on big boats usually hop out of the cockpit and sidle along the sidedeck to catch rays on the foredeck . Not on the Alegria , where it 's a stroll forward to the next cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also on the foredeck are two neat , built-in reclining sun lounges that snap up to a sitting position . The Alegria 's outboard-flaring stainless-steel bowrail itself contributes to the foredeck acreage , which also makes a great forum for an impromptu cocktail party . But be sure to remind your guests to step carefully when the deck is wet as the molded-in nonskid is of the sand-like pattern rather than the more efficient diamond-cut type . I tested the Doral on Canada 's Ottawa River , or , depending on which shore you 're on , Riviere des Outaouais , which separates the English-speaking Province of Ottawa from the French language-dominant Province de Qubec . Fortunately , the Alegria needed no translation as its performance on either side of the river was exemplary . Getting away from the dock , for instance , was less than painless , in part due to the Alegria 's standard Sidepower bowthruster and its Volvo Penta electronic controls with cable backup . ( Our test boat was powered by twin 480-hp Volvo Penta TAMD 75/ZF280A in-line six diesels . ) For those of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to their lack of resistance and their ability to sometimes slip from one gear to another a bit too effortlessly , rest assured ; these controls offer the same resistance as a well-tuned cable set . What was even more impressive , however , was the Alegria 's seamless rise to plane at about 1800 rpm ( 19.5 mph ) . Although at 11 seconds , it planed somewhat slowly , the Alegria did it without any of the extreme bow rise that is so common among cruisers of this breed . Better still was its reluctance to drop off plane until the rpm dropped below 1650 . A boat that can hold plane at a lower rpm than it takes to attain that exalted state typically boasts a good hull/powertrain marriage . The engine room is accessed from the cockpit by a manual lifting hatch that comes up easily due to a well-designed central ram . As I 've come to expect with these Volvo Penta layouts , the plumbing and electrics are thoroughly professional with everything no-sweat accessible . The cockpit flooring is mounted on easily removable aluminum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be hassle-free . Just as hassle-free is the Alegria 's hands-off anchoring arrangement . A remote-controlled windlass lives underneath its own clamshell hatch . It 's flanked by two molded-in compartments that should provide access to the rode if necessary , but , instead , they 're used as fender holders . When the inserts for the fenders are removed , the rode is accessible . I would yank out the inserts and find somewhere else to stow the fenders . Below , the cabin layout , with a master stateroom forward and guest quarters aft , is delightful . In the master , for instance , instead of a separate shower area in the head compartment , the shower has its own compartment to port and the head is to starboard , where there 's enough room for a more spacious vanity . Abaft the master , the galley faces a crescent-shaped lounge , thus keeping the cook in the social scene ; without handholds below , however , it can be lurch city if the passage is a rough one . The Alegria 45 was introduced with fanfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was all the hype justified ? Sure , but not necessary . This boat makes its own statement  --  just by its impressive presence .
