Prologue December 23 , 2005 This is how it feels when you realize your child is missing : The pit of your stomach freezes fast , while your legs go to jelly . There 's one single , blue-bass thud of your heart . The shape of her name , sharp as metal filings , gets caught between your teeth even as you try to force it out in a shout . Fear breathes like a monster into your ear : Where did I see her last ? Would she have wandered away ? Who could have taken her ? And then , finally , your throat seals shut , as you swallow the fact that you 've made a mistake you will never be able to fix . The first time it happened to Daniel Stone , a decade ago , he had been visiting Boston . His wife was at a colloquium at Harvard ; that was a good enough reason to take a family vacation . While Laura sat on her panel , Daniel pushed Trixie 's stroller the cobbled length of the Freedom Trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they watched the sloe-eyed sea turtles doing water ballet at the aquarium . After that , when Trixie announced that she was hungry , Daniel headed toward Faneuil Hall and its endless food court . That particular April day was the first one warm enough for New Englanders to unzip their jackets , to remember that there was any season other than winter . In addition to the centipedes of school groups and the shutter-happy tourists , it seemed that the whole of the financial district had bled out , men Daniel 's age in suits and ties , who smelled of aftershave and envy . They sat with their gyros and chowder and corned beef on rye on the benchesnear the statue of Red Auerbach . They sneaked sideways glances at Daniel . He was used to this it was unusual for a father to be the primary caretaker of his four-year-old daughter . Women who saw him with Trixie assumed that his wife had died , or that he was newly divorced . Men who saw him quickly looked the other way , embarrassed on his behalf . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . He enjoyed molding his job around Trixie 's schedule . He liked her questions : Did dogs know they were naked ? Is adult supervision a power grown-ups use to fight bad guys ? He loved the fact that when Trixie was spacing out in her car seat and wanted attention , she always started with " Dad . . . ? " even if Laura happened to be driving the car . " What do you want for lunch ? " Daniel asked Trixie that day in Boston . " Pizza ? Soup ? A burger ? " She stared up at him from her stroller , a miniature of her mother with the same blue eyes and strawberry hair , and nodded yes to all three . Daniel had hefted the stroller up the steps to the central food court , the scent of the salted ocean air giving way to grease and onions and stir-fry . He would get Trixie a burger and fries , he decided , and for himself , he 'd buy a fisherman 's platter at another kiosk . He stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stone that altered the flow of human traffic . " A cheeseburger , " Daniel yelled out to a cook he hoped was listening . When he was handed the paper plate he juggled his wallet free so that he could pay and then decided that it was n't worth a second tour of duty just to get himself lunch , too . He and Trixie could share . Daniel maneuvered the stroller into the stream of people again , waiting to be spit out into the cupola . After a few minutes , an elderly man sitting at a long table shuffled his trash together and left . Daniel set down the burger and turned the stroller so that he could feed Trixie but the child inside was a dark-haired , dark-skinned infant who burst into tears when he saw the stranger in front of him . Daniel 's first thought : Why was this baby in Trixie 's stroller ? His second : Was this Trixie 's stroller ? Yes , it was yellow and blue with a tiny repeating bear print . Yes , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these , thousands alone in the Northeast . Now , at closer inspection , Daniel realized that this particular stroller had a plastic activity bar attached on the front . Trixie 's ratty security blanket was not folded up in the bottom , just in case of crisis . Such as now . Daniel looked down at the baby again , the baby that was not his , and immediately grabbed the stroller and starting running to the grill . Standing there , with a cabbage-cheeked Boston cop , was a hysterical mother whose sights homed in on the stroller Daniel was using to part the crowd like the Red Sea . She ran the last ten feet and yanked her baby out of the safety restraint and into her arms while Daniel tried to explain , but all that came out of his mouth was , " Where is she ? " He thought , hysterical , of the fact that this was an open-air market , that there was no way to seal the entrance or even make a general public announcement , that by now five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who stole her on the T heading to the farthest outskirts of the Boston suburbs . Then he noticed the stroller his stroller kicked over onto its side , the safety belt undone . Trixie had gotten proficient at this just last week . It had gotten comical they would be out walking and suddenly she was standing up in the fabric hammock , facing Daniel , grinning at her own clever expertise . Had she freed herself to come looking for him ? Or had someone , seeing a golden opportunity for abduction , done it for her ? In the moments afterward , there were tracts of time that Daniel could n't remember even to this day . For example , how long it took the swarm of police that converged on Faneuil Hall to do a search . Or the way other mothers pulled their own children close to their side as he passed , certain bad luck was contagious . The detective 's hammered questions , a quiz of good parenting : How tall is Trixie ? What does she weigh ? What was she wearing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one , Daniel could n't answer . Had he , or had he just been planning to ? Would Trixie know to scream , to run away ? Would she be loud enough , fast enough ? The police wanted him to sit down , so that they 'd know where to find him if necessary . Daniel nodded and promised , and then was on his feet the moment their backs were turned . He searched behind each of the food kiosks in the central court . He looked under the tables in the cupola . He burst into the women 's bathroom , crying Trixie 's name . He checked beneath the ruffled skirts of the pushcarts that sold rhinestone earrings , moose socks , your name written on a grain of rice . Then he ran outside . The courtyard was full of people who did n't know that just twenty feet away from them the world had been overturned . Oblivious , they shopped and milled and laughed as Daniel stumbled past them . The corporate lunch hour had ended , and many of the businessmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind , caught between the cobblestones . And huddled beside the seated bronze of Red Auerbach , sucking her thumb , was Trixie . Until Daniel saw her , he did n't truly realize how much of himself had been carved away by her absence . He felt ironically the same symptoms that had come the moment he knew she was missing : the shaking legs , the loss of speech , the utter immobility . " Trixie , " he said finally , then she was in his arms , thirty pounds of sweet relief . Now ten years later Daniel had again mistaken his daughter for someone she was n't . Except this time , she was no longer a four-year-old in a stroller . This time , she had been gone much longer than twenty-four minutes . And she had left him , instead of the other way around . Forcing his mind back to the present , Daniel cut the throttle of the snow machine as he came to a fork in the path . Immediately the storm whipped into a funnel he could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the time to look behind , his tracks had already been filled , a seamless stretch . The Yup'ik Eskimos had a word for this kind of snow , the kind that bit at the back of your eyes and landed like a hail of arrows on your bare skin : pirrelvag . The term rose in Daniel 's throat , as startling as a second moon , proof that he had been here before , no matter how good a job he 'd done of convincing himself otherwise . He squinted it was nine o'clock in the morning , but in December in Alaska , there was n't much sunlight . His breath hung before him like lace . For a moment , through the curtain of snow , he thought he could see the bright flash of her hair a fox 's tail peeking from a snug woolen cap but as quickly as he saw it , it was gone . The Yupiit also had a word for the moments when it was so cold that a mug of water thrown into the air would harden like glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One wrong move , Daniel thought , and everything will go to pieces around me . So he closed his eyes , gunned the machine , and let instinct take over . Almost immediately , the voices of elders he used to know came back to him spruce needles stick out sharper on the north side of trees ; shallow sandbars make the ice buckle hints about how to find yourself , when the world changed around you . He suddenly thought back to the way , at Faneuil Hall , Trixie had melted against him when they were reunited . Her chin had notched just behind his shoulder , her body went boneless with faith . In spite of what he 'd done , she 'd still trusted him to keep her safe , to bring her home . In hindsight , Daniel could see that the real mistake he 'd made that day had n't been turning his back momentarily . It had been believing that you could lose someone you loved in an instant , when in reality it was a process that took months , years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made your eyelashes freeze the minute you walked outside and the insides of your nostrils feel like shattered glass . It was the kind of cold that went through you as if you were no more than a mesh screen . Trixie Stone shivered on the frozen riverbank beneath the school building that was checkpoint headquarters in Tuluksak , sixty miles from the spot where her father 's borrowed snow machine was carving a signature across the tundra , and tried to think up reasons to stay right where she was . Unfortunately , there were more reasons better reasons to leave . First and foremost , it was a mistake to stay in one place too long . Second , sooner or later , people were going to figure out that she was n't who they thought she was , especially if she kept screwing up every task they gave her . But then again , how was she supposed to know that all the mushers were entitled to complimentary straw for their sled dogs at several points during the K300 racecourse , including here in Tuluksak ? Or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water was stored . . . but you were n't allowed to help feed the dogs ? After those two fiascos , Trixie was demoted to babysitting the dogs that were dropped from a team , until the bush pilots arrived to transport them back to Bethel . So far the only dropped dog was a husky named Juno . Frostbite that was the official reason given by the musher . The dog had one brown eye and one blue eye , and he stared at Trixie with an expression that spoke of being misunderstood . In the past hour , Trixie had managed to sneak Juno an extra handful of kibble and a couple of biscuits , stolen from the vet 's supply . She wondered if she could buy Juno from the musher with some of the money left over in the stolen wallet . She thought maybe it would be easier to keep running if she had someone else to confide in , someone who could n't possibly tell on her . She wondered what Zephyr and Moss and anyone else back home in the other Bethel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a snowbank and eating salmon jerky and listening for the crazy fugue of barking that preceded the arrival of a dog team . Probably , they would think she had lost her mind . They 'd say , Who are you , and what have you done with Trixie Stone ? The thing is , she wanted to ask the same question . She wanted to crawl into her favorite flannel pajamas , the ones that had been washed so often they were as soft as the skin of a rose . She wanted to open up the refrigerator and not be able to find anything on its stocked shelves worth eating . She wanted to get sick of a song on the radio and smell her father 's shampoo and trip over the curly edge of the rug in the hallway . She wanted to go back not just to Maine , but to early September . Trixie could feel tears rising in her throat like the watermarks on the Portland dock , and she was afraid someone would notice . So she lay down on the matted straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " she whispered , " I got left behind once , too . " Her father did n't think she remembered what had happened that day in Faneuil Hall , but she did bits and pieces cropped up at the strangest times . Like when they went to the beach in the summer and she smelled the ocean : It suddenly got harder to breathe . Or how at hockey games and movie theaters and other places where she got mixed up in a crowd , she sometimes felt sick to her stomach . Trixie remembered , too , that they had abandoned the stroller at Faneuil Hall her father simply carried her back in his arms . Even after they returned from vacation and bought a new stroller , Trixie had refused to ride in it . Here 's what she did n't remember about that day : the getting-lost part . Trixie could not recall unbuckling the safety harness or pushing through the shifting sea of legs to the doors that led outside . Then , she saw the man who looked like he might be her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting down . Trixie had walked to the bench and climbed up beside him only to realize that his metal skin was warm , because the sun had been beating down on it all day . She 'd curled up against the statue , wishing with every shaky breath that she would be found . This time around , that 's what scared her most .
