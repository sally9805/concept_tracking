There are days when I honestly think there 's no escape from rock and roll . <p> The limo from the airport had dropped me off at not quite four in the morning . The lights in the hall and the front room were on ; I 'd have been willing to bet that Bree had n't been to bed at all , had n't slept except for short naps . I 'd also have laid odds that she 'd kept the status of my flight up on her computer in the kitchen alcove , tracking it as it made its way across the Atlantic and over Canada . <p> By the time I 'd hit the bottom stair , she was waiting for me at the top , with the door open and the cats wreathing around her ankles . This , Bree within touching distance , was what I 'd been looking forward to , consciously jonesing for , for at least a week ; she 'd welcomed me back off the road so many times over the last twenty-five years that this homecoming had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it 's so comfy . Coming home to Bree , it always feels like that , you know ? <p> This time was no different . First words out of her mouth  --  after I 'd dropped the guitars and kissed her for about three minutes , and after she got her breath back  --  were an announcement that there would be nothing happening before noon . I thought about teasing her over it , she sounded so fierce , but I was too tired and too dragged down . She kissed me again , fussed over me as if she 'd been ten years my senior instead of eleven years my junior , fed me some light gorgeous soup and homemade bread and my nighttime meds , and even managed not to ask how I was feeling . Once I put the spoon down , she had me upstairs , into bed , and unconscious . <p> I 've known Bree since she was a dewy-eyed teenager . That 's a quarter-century of knowing , and she 's always been the wrong person to argue with . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my health , that I usually do what she tells me and I do n't go on about it . I do n't lie to her about what my health is doing , either . My old lady can be fierce , when the spirit moves her . I find it 's a lot easier to be up-front with her , and avoid pissing her off . <p> Problem is , even Bree ca n't control the outside world , though it 's not for lack of trying . So when my cell phone rang at twenty of nine the next morning , she 'd got it and taken it into the hallway , ready to verbally rip whoever was calling this early a new one , before I could get my eyelids unglued . <p> It was just as well , since ungluing the lids was likely to take a while . I do n't do mornings very well in any case ; I do n't mean to go on about the MS , but it 's worst during that first hour of the day . I 've tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminding me to take my morning pain meds , but she does n't seem to find that funny . <p> This morning was worse than usual . Jet lag 's always a drag , but it 's a lot worse coming late to early in time zones ; San Francisco to Europe , I take a nap and my body adjusts , but this direction , it 's just bloody miserable . Makes it tricky for a touring musician , you know ? <p> I lay in bed for a few minutes , eyes closed , feeling sunlight coming in through the bay windows , and trying to pinpoint where the biggest problems of the day were likely to be . Sole of the right foot , I decided ; it was tingling and wanting to cramp . <p> I flexed both legs , nice and slow , trying to be careful , keep the stabs at bay ; that did n't work very well , and I bit back noise . Right quad , bloody hell , shit , that was going to be a drag  --  the entire muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quad-riceps . The hands , mercifully , seemed fine . It 's not easy being a guitar player with a disease that can take all the sensation from your fingers without prior notice . To night I was due for my weekly shot , the drug that keeps me out of a wheelchair , and that was completely cocked up already , what with my internal clock thinking it was eight hours ahead and still on London time . <p> It was right around then that I finally started paying attention to Bree 's voice , drifting in through the closed bedroom door . There was a familiar note in it , exasperation , but more than that  --  it was mixed up with something else . <p> " Carla , why the hell " Silence . I could almost imagine the staccato rapping of Carla Fanucci , Blacklight 's imported  --  from  --  New York publicity handler and American operations manager . Bree 's voice came again , this time with something new in it  --  anger , or disbelief , maybe . " biographer ? No , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course I 'm sure ! Carla , I do n't know what you 're talking about ! You want John to do what ? No way . No . I said , no . Not a chance in hell he 's going to  --  no , I really do n't care whether  --  " <p> Silence , this time far too long . Bree , woken too early or , worse yet , thinking I 'd been woken too early , would be quiet this long only if something was wrong . And Carla , well , if Carla was demanding I do something and ringing up this early to say so , it had to be something major . She knew just how late I 'd got to bed last night . <p> I got to the door just as Bree was opening it . The brief push-me pull-you would have been funny , if the look on her face had n't killed any desire to laugh . She had this bleached , lost look on her face , and I felt my own stomach knot up ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the table . That subject 's name is Cilla . I 'm married to her . <p> " Here . " Bree handed me the phone , not meeting my eye . Her mouth was twisted down tight . Shit . She was swallowing tears ; Bree does n't cry in front of me , never has done . This had to be something huge . What in hell could Carla have said ? <p> " Bree ? " <p> " It 's for you . " Bree 's voice was bleak . " Carla . Something about a biography , a personal history of the band . She says you know all about it , and that it 's important , and that it ca n't wait . Here . Take it , please . " <p> I opened my mouth to answer , to say Look , love , I have n't got a clue what you 're on about , but I did n't get the chance . She turned on her heel and went , heading down to the kitchen . I heard water running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smother the sound of crying ? I stayed where I was . Bree would n't thank me for intruding right now . <p> " JP ? Are you there ? " <p> " Yeah . " Her voice was a bit sharper than usual . So was mine . " Yeah , I 'm here . Bloody hell . I did n't get home until four this morning , Carla  --  you already know that . The European tour ended yesterday , remember ? What ever this is about , could n't it have waited a few hours ? " <p> " Sorry . " That was bollocks . She was n't sorry . This was her job , and she was damned good at it . " But no , this really could n't wait . And what do you mean , what ever this is about ? It 's about this biography . I would n't have dragged you out of bed this early for anything else . " <p> " What biography ? " I was dizzy , a bit off , and my jaw was tingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was also an indicator that I might want to start thinking about bracing myself for an exacerbation of the MS . Not a good sign . " What are you on about ? " <p> " Oh , damn . " Her voice had changed . " I called Ian about this yesterday  --  you guys were onstage playing . He was supposed to tell the entire band about it . No wonder Bree 's so pissed off . I 'm sorry , JP . Ian did say he 'd tell everyone . " <p> " Yeah , well , what ever it is , Ian did n't tell me . Maybe he told everyone else , but this is the first I 've heard about a biography . Telling the entire band , was he ? Have I been given the sack from Blacklight and no one 's told me yet ? " <p> For some reason , I was feeling pissy , right at the edge of being insulted . If that was what Stu and Cal had been looking unhappy about after the gig last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I left , and he had n't done it . <p> Carla picked up on it , of course . She 's razor-sharp , that girl is , but she 'd have had to be completely dim not to suss out that my silence was because I was narked as hell and did n't want to snap at her . <p> " You must have left for Heathrow before he had it together . " Her tone had changed again . " Damn . Sorry , JP . I really did n't mean to cause a situation here . I assumed you knew about it already . To be fair to Ian , I sort of dumped it on him in mid-gig , and he had a lot of stuff going on . I 'm really sorry . Apologise to Bree for me , will you ? " <p> " Yeah , I will . Look , hang on a moment , will you , please ? " I covered the phone and gave in to a jaw-cracking yawn . " Sorry , I 'm dead on my feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd better do it . What 's all this about , Carla ? " <p> " There 's an unofficial biography and history of the band in the works . I got the early word yesterday . " I could hear her sucking down air . " The guy writing it ? Perry Dillon . " <p> " Shit ! " <p> Bree 's reaction  --  that miserable lost look of hers , her silence , her refusal to meet my eye  --  had suddenly become entirely appropriate to a simple phone call . There were biographers , and then there was Perry Dillon . <p> " Perry Dillon . " I sat down hard . " The same bloke who writes all those knife-in-the-ribs exposT books ? The one every-one 's afraid to turf off the premises when he slithers in , because they 're afraid of his tactics once they ca n't keep an eye on him ? That Perry Dillon ? " <p> " That 's the only Perry Dillon I know about . " This time , Carla actually did sound almost apologetic . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset Bree , JP . I was n't trying to . But we need to tackle this , like , now . We have to decide just how we 're going to handle it . This guy is n't going to just go away . I was hoping you 'd have a few ideas of your own about it , but I guess I 'm the bad-news girl on this one . " <p> " Jesus . " This was a hell of a way to wake up , having to try to wrap my head around the idea of Blacklight being targeted by Perry Dillon , a world-class sleaze making million-dollar advances off " histories " that were at least half full of every unsubstantiated rumour the man could find . <p> What a mess . No wonder Bree was downstairs in the kitchen , crying . This was going to be ugly , if the bloke could n't be handled properly . " Carla , please tell me you have n't told him I was willing to talk to him . You have n't , right ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JP . He has n't called me yet . I got this one nice and early , strictly backchannel , which is why I called Ian as soon as I confirmed the rumour . It 's also why I took the chance and woke you up , and no , by the way , I have n't forgotten what time you got home . I 'm the one who booked your flight back from London , remember ? The thing is " <p> " you want to get to him before he gets to us . That it ? " I got off the bed , trying to shake the needles and cramps out of my feet . No good  --  the body was doing its own thing . I went and sat in Bree 's rocking chair . <p> " Of course . Grab the offensive first , and maybe we can get some control on the spin . If we can spike the bastard 's guns , I say we do it . But " Her voice trailed away . I knew what she was n't saying . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What with having hooked up with Bree when she was technically too young to be with me legally , even though I did n't know it at the time . Would n't want Perry Dillon making me out to be a statutory rapist . And of course , there 's my bloody wife , and my drug bust , and the fact that I was deported . And , since I 'm me and not Mac , I actually give a shit about hanging on to some privacy , what with Bree being damned near pathological about it . So I 'm the first one you rang . Of course . Right . Got it . " <p> I honestly did n't think my voice came out any different , but I could almost hear Carla flinch . " JP , look  --  " <p> " No , you 're right . " Of course she was right ; she was brilliant at her job . That 's why Blacklight  --  the corporate entity rather than merely five dinosaurs who 'd toured sold-out venues all over the world for thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously tempted to have a few pointed words with Ian , though ; for some reason , his not including me in that " entire band " thing was rankling more than it should . " Not your fault . You 're right , we need to deal with it . What do you want me to do ? " <p> She told me . A few minutes later , I clicked the phone off , took a very fast shower and my morning meds , got dressed , and went downstairs . I 'm being honest here : I did n't much want to . Bree gets upset about very few things in this world , but there was no way I could pretend that the situation , at least the way Carla 'd spun it , was going to be anything other than miserable . <p> She was in the kitchen , surrounded by cats . Our senior cat , Wolfling , was curled up in her lap . For all that I 'd rescued him as a tiny tabby kitten from a shoe box at the local market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past ten years . Her Siamese queen , Farrowen , was on the table , her tail curling around the bottom of Bree 's coffee mug ; right now , she was staring at me , not blinking , making me feel guilty . Our teenaged moggy , Simon , ignored us both . He was busy chasing dust motes . <p> " Do you want breakfast ? " <p> Her voice was neutral . Damn . I knew what that careful tone of hers meant : She 'd already decided to bite the bullet and make it easy for me , which effectively meant I could n't bring it up with her . Of course , if I went along with it and let her make it easy for me , I 'd lose all right to deal with any of the fallout . As nice as it is having her smooth my path , there are times when I 'd like to thump her . <p> " Bree , listen  --  " <p> " You should eat , " she told me . Same damned flat uninflected tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sod breakfast . " I perched on the edge of the table . " Look , love , I do n't want to make light of this , all right ? And no , I did n't know a damned thing about it until Carla told me . She rang Ian about it last night , probably while we were in the middle of the show closer , and he did n't bother telling me before I left for Heathrow . And believe me , I 'm planning on having a few choice words with the lad . Anyway , Carla wants to try to minimise the damage before this bloke ever gets started . Thing is  --  " <p> " I know . Fat chance . Believe me , I know . " Her face had gone stony . She was putting up her usual Brave Little Woman walls , and kicking them down was going to take as much energy as dealing with Perry Dillon . Bloody hell , why could n't she understand she was making it harder for me , not easier ? <p> She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying . Bree has very few feelings that I ca n't read in her face , but she was n't letting me see her face , and that meant there were things she wanted to keep hidden . " I do get it , John . Is there any way at all you can at least demand some control over what questions he asks ? " <p> " Have n't got a clue , love . We can try , and we will , you know that . I trust Carla to put the hammer down about what 's off-limits . Whether it works " I leaned over , ignoring protest from my jet-lagged muscles , and laid my cheek against her hair . I ca n't do that unless she 's sitting  --  she 's nearly two inches taller than I am . " I 'm sorry , Bree . I 'll do my best to keep this from getting out of hand . We 'll get through it . " <p> " You think so ? " She looked up at me finally , and I felt my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch up and stay even . I 've got a heart condition , something the doctors call arrhythmia , which means my heart does these bizarre little speed-ups . Some days , I felt like I was keeping the local casualty ward  --  the emergency room , right , I was a California resident now , not a Londoner anymore  --  in business . <p> I met Bree 's eye . Her own were remote ; something about the way the muscles of her face were working , I could see the pain . <p> Maybe she 'd sensed that bit of heart action , because she tried for a lighter note . " We could sic Mac 's bodyguard on him . " <p> " She 'd probably love that . " The picture of Domitra wiping the floor with a shadowy Perry Dillon  --  using every one of her martial arts skills and maybe a few bits of weaponry just for a lark  --  was too lovely to pass up . " Hell , I 'd love that . I 'd do it in a heartbeat . Bree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles at the moment . That means I 'm up first  --  it 'll be down in Carla 's office . I 'll ask once , and only once : Do you want to be there when I talk to him ? " <p> " No ! " It was pain , all right , and maybe panic , too . " Dear God , how could you think I 'd even consider being there ? Twenty-five years together , you do n't know me better than that ? That 's not what I want at all . " <p> " Then what do you want ? " Here we went again , Bree with the walls that were supposed to protect me , and all they ever did was keep me out . " Tell me what you want . " <p> She got up , too fast ; Wolfling slid off her lap onto the floor . <p> " Invisibility , " she told me quietly , and left me standing there . <p> Two days later , walking into Blacklight 's Los Angeles offices , I was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interview with Perry Dillon that was worrying me . I 'd flown down from San Francisco the night before , still jet-lagged and achy as hell . I 'd also come down without Bree . She 'd opted to stay home entirely . <p> That surprised me , and it worried me , as well . Bree loves L.A. , the shops and restaurants , the feel of the city itself . We 'd been there a few times together , when I was doing California tours with my pickup band , the Fog City Geezers , and she always has a good time . <p> So I 'd expected her to come down and wander around while I was working , the way she always did . Instead , she 'd muttered something about not being able to find someone to watch the cats . That was complete rubbish . We were only going to be gone a day and a night and anyway , we 've got a bloke called Sammy who keeps house for us when we 're on the road . But it was obvious she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this interview , and I had n't pushed her . That comment of hers  --  that she wanted to be invisible  --  had planted itself in my head , and it was sitting there , next to my own pissiness at Ian . It was n't a comfortable feeling . <p> Excerpted from Rock &amp; Roll Never Forgets by Deborah Grabien . <p> Copyright 2008 by Deborah Grabien . <p> Published in 2008 by St. Martin
