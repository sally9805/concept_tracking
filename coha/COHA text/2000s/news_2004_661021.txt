<p> Headlines from the past few months suggest that Americans wince when they think their heroes are lying to them . <p> News reports plead for honesty : Did the Bush administration lie about an Iraqi weapons program ? Did John Kerry lie about throwing away his Vietnam War metals ? Did Pentagon brass lie about orders given to torture Iraqi prisoners ? <p> Though the public expects truth and bristles when fed lies , wider trends indicate those same outraged Americans are increasingly telling lies of their own to get ahead in school , business , and relationships - and apparently feel OK about it . For example : <p> * 74 percent of high school students , in a 2002 survey of 12,000 respondents , said they had cheated on an exam at least once in the past year , according to the Josephson Institute of Ethics . In 1992 , 61 percent of students reported having cheated . The latest craze is to use cellular phones to photograph exams and show friends in the following class . <p> * After doing 3.8 million background checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of job applicants had lied on their resumes . <p> * The list of corporate executives accused of lying to defraud investors now includes those of Tyco , Enron , WorldCom , and Parmalat . <p> In the high-pressure , high-stakes environment of 21st- century America , lying has for many apparently become a way of life , even among those whose faith demands truth-telling . People may know it 's wrong to lie in theory , researchers say , but in practice they feel the success they want will be out of reach if they admit their flaws and sins along the way . <p> " They think , ' If I 'm playing by rules that no one else plays by , then I 'm disadvantaging myself in a way that 's apt to play out over a lifetime , ' " says David Callahan , author of " The Cheating Culture : Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead . " " When various pressures come together , it 's enough to push aside those other strictures people follow with regard to honesty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 percent of Americans pray regularly , most traditions still regard honesty as a core virtue . From the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments , which prohibit the bearing of false witness , to the Zoroastrian belief that lying destroys holy order , the faiths that guide Americans almost universally insist on truth-telling as a necessity for respectable living . <p> This professed code , however , seems to be holding little sway against what some call " pressures " and others call " temptations . " Explanations for today 's lying crisis vary according to the implications . <p> For instance , those who help clerical job seekers find work say they often hear clients speak of marketplace pressures to exaggerate their skills . Both Neil Wilson and Pat Peterson say their Newburyport , Mass. , clients sometimes feel " forced " to falsify their resumes , and the frequency of such deception has increased in the current economic drought . At Priority Personnel Inc. , Ms. Peterson says , 25 percent of those who claim a particular level of competence turn out to be lying when she tests them on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're forced to be better than they really are to get a job , " Mr. Wilson says . " Desperation does nasty things to people . It makes them go beyond their normal threshold . " <p> In Callahan 's analysis , it 's not just the unskilled who are buckling under mounting pressures to lie . Today 's " winner take all " incentive system , he says , pays barely a living wage to workers in journalism , the arts , and minor league professional athletics , for instance , while top achievers make millions . The result : Some figure , why not take a chance if a little plagiarism or steroid use can make me rich ? <p> " It 's now more lucrative to lie , " says Diane Swanson , professor of professional ethics at Kansas State University . " People must know there is a risk , but the payoff is potentially enormous ... Conversely , if you admit you had a flat quarter or a flat year , then the market will penalize you . " <p> Though enticements and pressures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor has cultural observers equally concerned : Individuals , it seems , are getting weaker when faced with temptation . Or put another way , many seem to know right from wrong , but material success has become more important to them than the task of sculpting moral character . <p> This assessment resonates with Michael Josephson , president of the Josephson Institute of Ethics in Los Angeles . For signs of moral decay , he says , look no further than prime-time television . Shows such as " The Apprentice " and " Survivor , " he says , send a clear message that the winner in life is often the one who deceives others without getting caught . <p> " Those shows are popular because people are n't offended by them , " Mr. Josephson says in a phone interview . " Temptations were greater in the Depression when people were more desperate . So it 's not that temptations are higher today . What 's changed is that our defenses have gotten lower . " <p> In a Josephson Institute survey , students at religious schools proved more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national average . Meanwhile , the list keeps growing of top achievers who got snared in their own web of lies . Martha Stewart awaits sentencing for lying to investigators ; 28 top federal employees hold fake degrees ; journalists at USA Today , The New York Times , and The Nation have presented fiction as fact . <p> Seen most charitably , the ever-rising toll of lies told to get ahead might in part reflect a rising level of scrutiny and standards for leaders , according to Douglas Porpora , author of " Landscapes of the Soul : The Loss of Moral Meaning in America . " Although lying has always been around , he says , today 's reporters who probe routinely into private lives are now more likely to find and expose it . <p> " In some senses , the bar has been raised in how the news covers it , " says Dr. Porpora , who chairs the department of culture and communications at Drexel University in Philadelphia . " John F. Kennedy was having affairs left and right . That 's dishonest , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Yet what 's also noteworthy today , Porpora adds , is that the ordinary person is willing to tolerate routine lying under certain circumstances . When the crime seems practically harmless - to cheat the government out of a few tax dollars , or to bill a rich client for a few unworked hours - then the working guy seems to have won , according to Porpora and other analysts . And when the culprit seems repentant , Dr. Swanson says , punishments sometimes amount to a slap on the wrist . <p> Solutions to the lying epidemic , cultural analysts say , might involve dual approaches : lessening pressures to cheat and heightening resistance in individuals . Mr. Callahan emphasizes the need to fix incentive systems that he says have produced " too much competitiveness , too much insecurity , " and " a gap between winners and losers that is too big . " Josephson , meanwhile , suggests educating the next generation , who may be enticed by the potential payoffs for liars , about the hefty costs of deception and shame . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's disgrace , " Josephson says . He offers the example of Richard Scrushy , former CEO of HealthSouth Corp. , whose indictment on 85 counts of fraud led a graffiti artist to scrawl " thief " across his statue in Birmingham , Ala . " We need to ask what our children will think of us when they say , ' Dad , you did what ? ' " <p> Given their mission to improve human character , religious institutions might be best positioned to restore the virtue of honesty , but they , too , face an uphill climb . According to the Rev. Jack Good , the church 's own truth-telling crisis runs deeper than the sexual abuse scandal that engulfed the Roman Catholic Church and forced bishops to explain why they kept quiet about known predatory priests . <p> " People who come to church on Sunday do n't see a people willing to confront conflict or tough issues or what biblical scholarship says about the Bible , " says Mr. Good , a retired pastor in the United Church of Christ and author of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad example on truth-telling , and I think a case can be made that it reverberates through all of society . " <p> Great progress could occur if Americans could reclaim the definitions of success as laid out in Judaism , Christianity , and Islam , according to American University Islamic studies chairman Akbar Ahmed . The trouble is , he says , too many profess to abide by an ancient faith but in actuality their passion is for social status and material gain . <p> " Those assumptions of life as a quest for moral improvement can not exist with a philosophy that you need to get to the top of the totem pole at all costs , " Dr. Ahmed says . " You can not have both . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
