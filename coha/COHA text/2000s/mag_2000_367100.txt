All in all , 1999-2000 was a pretty good season to be a bitter old person , which is to say , as defined by TV advertisers and the Internet economy , anyone over 27 . Not only did dotcom whippersnappers get spanked by the NASDAQ , but TV 's youthquake  --  when networks unleashed a hot-bodied army of Dawson 's Creek clones to capture young audiences  --  triggered an avalanche of zit fatigue . The teen cop ( Ryan Caulfield ) , the earnest young politicos ( D.C. ) , the sexy prepsters ( the never-aired Manchester Prep )  --  all were dead on arrival , while older-skewing dramas thrived . <P> For much of the new crop , DOA was not a moment too soon . But the backlash also caught three of TV 's brightest , most heartfelt programs  --  Felicity , Roswell and Freaks and Geeks  --  each of which happens to feature protagonists not yet old enough to drink , and each of which is counting on creative fan support and deus ex machinas to keep it from becoming a teen angel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it rise , Carrie-like , from the grave . The final episode of the comedy-drama , about high schoolers fixated on Dungeons and Dragons and Led Zeppelin in 1980 , may be the most elegiac , exuberant and inventive finale of the season . But you 'll have to go to a museum to see it . When NBC axed the series in March  --  after shelving and relaunching it so many times viewers needed a divining rod to find it  --  the Museum of Television and Radio made the unusual offer to screen its six unaired episodes at its New York City and Los Angeles locations , on April 29 and May 13 , respectively . As creator Paul Feig notes , the museum honored the show earlier at its annual William Paley Festival , an ironic comfort as the ratings flagged . " The running joke on the set was , ' We 're doing it for the museum . ' As it turned out , we actually were . " <P> Freaks ' strength , and perhaps its ratings liability , was that it resisted easy pigeonholing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a wry , adult perspective , without easy nerd jokes , implausible sex scenes or a single false moment . " It 's closer to Welcome to the Dollhouse than to Dawson 's Creek , " says executive producer Judd Apatow . " And as much as I liked Welcome to the Dollhouse , it did n't make as much money as Scream . " Indeed , the closest analogs to Freaks are not TV shows but independent films  --  Dollhouse , Rushmore , Dazed and Confused . Unfortunately , there are n't as many outlets for indie TV as for indie film . So the show 's studio , DreamWorks , is making a last-ditch effort to sell it to a broadcast network , arguing that the show 's fiercely loyal fan base indicates room for growth . <P> Such Lazarus acts , while rare , have become less so lately , with six networks looking for content . CBS picked up its hit JAG from NBC , and the WB just spirited off ABC 's teen-witch com , Sabrina . ( ABC 's psych-ward drama , Wonderland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) But Apatow admits the re-Freaking of TV is a long shot . " If anyone needs to fill an hour with NBC 's lowest-rated show , " he cracks , " they 'll buy it ! "
