Why women love to vent . Plus , how to tell when your griping is healthy and when it 's more likely to bring you down . by Hagar Scher // it started out innocently . I was attending brunch at a friend 's house . The aroma of bacon and coffee wafted through the air ; our infants napped contentedly . But before long , our chatting turned into moaning and groaning . One friend began complaining about her motherin-law 's behavior at a recent dinner . Another kvetched about his brother 's out-of-control toddler . Yet another deplored her boss 's ineptitude . Soon I was bad-mouthing my own mother , who had just visited . One small complaint had snowballed into an avalanche of dissatisfaction . Open your ears and you 'll find that complaining is an integral part of most people 's daily exchanges . " For example , we use complaints as icebreakers , " says Robin Kowalski , Ph.D. , a professor of psychology at Clemson University . " We start a conversation with a negative observation because we know that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's just one of the ways in which griping comes in handy . According to Kowalski , there are two basic categories of complaints : instrumental and expressive . Instrumental complaints are goal oriented , meaning that we verbalize the problem in hopes of bringing about change . You rant to your husband about how messy the bedroom is because you 're hoping he 'll offer to help clean it up . You tell the hotel manager that the garbage trucks woke you up at 5:00 A.M. because you want a better room . Expressive complaints have a different mission : to let the speaker get something off her chest . When you call a friend to wail that all three kids have strep at the same time , you 're not looking for medical advice . It 's acknowledgment and sympathy you 're after . " Even complaining about the driver who cut you off can be healthy , provided you feel better once you get it out , " says Kowalski . But here 's the downside : Some people abuse expressive complaining , grumbling incessantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or human connection . WHY WE GRIPE SO MUCH Michael Cunningham , Ph.D. , a psychologist at the University of Louisville , observes that humans ' taste for complaining probably evolved from our ancestors ' way of crying out a warning when something threatened the tribe . " We mammals are a squealing species . We talk about things that bother us as a way of getting help or seeking a posse to mount a counterattack , " says Cunningham . True , we no longer have to buddy up in the face of menacing saber-toothed tigers , but venting our everyday grievances to receptive listeners ( a.k.a. expressive complaining ) helps us feel validated and supported . Says my friend Tracy , mother of two daughters : " All the moms in our playgroup complain a lot . Venting helps us to feel less alone and less guilty about our frustrations as our kids go through the terrible twos . " Complaining can do more than just connect you to others in the same boat . A complaint can be a tool for what Kowalski calls impression management , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how she 's too busy and always has dozens of projects on her plate , she is employing a subset of expressive complaining . She might be trying to convince her audience that she is important and valued at work . People with healthy self-esteem are more likely than others to register instrumental complaints , according to Kowalski 's research . This is probably because they are confident that their grievances are legitimate and they believe that kvetching could make a difference . For some people , speaking out against whatever bothers them is a way of asserting I matter ! ARE WOMEN THE COMPLAINING SEX ? Cunningham believes that society gives women-stereotyped as the more sensitive , talkative , and easily offended gender-more permission to engage in the expressive brand of complaining . On the other hand , groups that are traditionally male , such as the military and blue-collar professions , encourage men to suck it up . " There 's an ethic of never complain , never explain , " he says . Kowalski sees it differently-based on her research , she characterizes complaining as a gender-blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of pet peeves , a very narrow subset of expressive complaints . In a study , she asked subjects to write down as many personal annoyances as they could come up with . Women jotted down nearly four times as many as the men did . " Women tend to be more likely to freak out about small tilings , " she observes . " On the other hand , not a single man said , " I ca n't stand it when she leaves the toilet seat down . ' ' " There may also be a difference in male-versus-female complaint goals , which in turn might explain why men favor the instrumental brand and women prefer the expressive . " If a wife comes home and complains about her work for 15 minutes , her husband might ask , " Why do n't you quit ? ' ' " says Deborah Tanncn , Ph.D. , author of You Just Do n't Understand : Women and Men in Conversation . " This will probably upset the wife , who might well respond , " But I like my job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a ritualistic way , as a means of bonding , whereas men usually do n't . SO , IS COMPLAINING GOOD OR BAD ? " In our society , we 're supposed to smile and have a nice day and pretend everything 's OK even when it 's not . That 's unreal , " says Barbara Held , Ph.D. , a professor of psychology at Bowdoin College . She believes that this emphasis on always seeing the bright side can encourage people to mask their unhappincss and swallow their gripes-but that can be toxic . " It 's important to learn how to tell friends and family when you 're upset-if you do n't , you end up alone in your pain . Complaints can be healing , " she says . Held argues that constructive complaining is an essential life skill . Her guidelines : Be up-front about your need to complain ( rather than try to pretend you 're just having a regular conversation ) , limit your kvetch rime , and do n't act as though your gripes trump everyone else 's . Above all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , you 're offended that your single friends never invite you to their girls ' night out-talk to one of them directly and try to reach a happy resolution . But with expressive complaints that are n't serious and ca n't really be fixed-you abhor your husband 's prized bobblehead collection-griping to a third party spares your marriage a lot of wear and tear . " I love my husband , but some of his habits annoy me . I know he wo n't change , so I complain to a friend , " says Jennifer . " I feel better once I get things off my chest-and , oddly enough , I also often feel closer to my husband . " Unhealthy complainers bellyache to anyone who crosses their path and do n't pick up on people 's cues that they 've had their fill of negativity . " Chronic complainers get stuck in victim mode , and that irritates the people around them , " says Cunningham . Plus , these types love to talk but rarely listen . " They 'll take hours of your time telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take one piece of advice you give them , " says Kowalski . Bad complainers are annoying at best , depressing at worst . They spread negativity and give griping a bad name . But if you really need to complain , go ahead . Because for most of us , behind the grousing is a basic human need : We 're looking for connection . <p>
