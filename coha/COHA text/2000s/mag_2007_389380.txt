Get Your Bull Without a Packstring ( or a Guide ) In the best years , only a quarter of hunters tag an elk in a typical Western state . That includes high-odds permit hunts . If you subtract general-tag hunters , those who did n't book with an outfitter and hunters who drew some slamdunk tag , the harvest percentage shrinks to around 15 percent . But every year a handful of hunters kill elk on public land , and they do it without a packstring , a 1,000-yard gun or the lungs of a biathlete . They 're the hunters whose trucks are parked at trailheads long before sunup , the ones who are dragging out a hindquarter as the rest of us are humping up the mountain . Some of them hunt the same ridges and meadows year after year , because that 's where the elk are . Others jump from one mountain range to another , depending on the season and the sign . Because that 's where the elk are . They 're not a particularly chatty bunch . Most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hunting companions who blabbed about their honey holes . But their experiences have taught them where elk live , how they behave and how to kill them when most hunters have given up . They want you to know that elk success is neither instant nor permanent . Instead , it 's achieved through a combination of basic hunting skills ; knowledge of how elk react to hunting pressure and weather ; a homesteader 's work ethic ; and the ability to convert an opportunity to venison . Do Your Homework Donna McDonald has seen a lot of elk die . And she 's commiserated with a lot of hunters who have left her southwestern Montana ranch with their elk tags intact and their dreams of bagging a Western bull shattered , or at least tarnished . McDonald owns Upper Canyon Outfitters in the heart of southwestern Montana 's elk country . She packs outfitted hunters to wall-tent camps deep in the National Forest , but she also offers a service to hunters who have neither the inclination nor the money to hire an outfitter . For a reasonable fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unguided hunters who walk in from the road . Both those perspectives  --  from outfitted and do-it-yourself hunters  --  have given her some time-tested insights into what it takes to kill elk consistently on public land in the West . " There are a lot of elk on National Forest land , especially in Montana , Wyoming and Colorado , " says McDonald . " The elk are there  --  you just need to do the homework about how to get them . " Successful hunters begin by gathering as much information as they can , long before they shoulder their hunting packs . " The ones who really take this seriously and end up filling their tags are the ones that take the time to visit with us , or to talk to a game warden or biologist , " she says . " Some guys will pay a lot of money to hunt elk here , then go to the local bar and get all sorts of conflicting information about where the elk are . They never see an elk . You have to have good sources . Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a guide . " Scouting is also important , says McDonald , but she stresses that getting to know the landscape , and how elk use it , may be more useful than finding elk a week before opening morning . " People do n't appreciate the huge effect hunting pressure has on elk , " she says . " The very act of scouting and moving through their habitat ensures that the elk wo n't be there on opening day . For the first week of the season , we 're scouting people , not elk . Wherever the people are , we go above them and that 's where the elk are . Into the second and third weeks of the season , the elk settle down and tend to be in more consistent places . " Prepare to Sweat Harry Harju , who has tagged 40 elk in his 36 years of hunting them across Wyoming , says most hunters do n't take the daunting challenge of killing an elk seriously enough . " The harvest success for elk is lower than for bighorn sheep and mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lives outside Cheyenne , Wyo . " It 's damned hard , but we get guys every year from the Midwest  --  guys who are really good whitetail hunters  --  who have heard that you have to be hiking by sunup . They 're wrong . You have to be where the elk are by sunup . That means you have to start hiking hours before sunup , but apparently most hunters are afraid of the dark . If you 're going to hunt elk , you start in the dark and you come back to camp after dark . Unless somebody kills an elk , we do n't come back to camp in the daylight . " Elk are hard to kill because they occupy remote , steep and densely timbered terrain . Commit yourself to hunting on foot , not from a four-wheeler or even from a horse . In a career with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department , Harju worked enough game-check stations to appreciate this trend : " The number of elk killed by a party of hunters is inversely proportional to the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many places in the West is because these are roadless areas where loud machines that displace elk are n't allowed . " You can boost your success if you learn the types of terrain elk use in different seasons , says Harju . " General-tag hunters in Wyoming can start hunting in mid-September and go right through November . Early in the season it 's still warm and dry , and those elk are wearing brand-new fur coats . They 're going to be where it 's wet and cool , which means north-facing slopes , down in waterways and around springs and seeps . " Later in the season  --  especially if a deep snow blankets the high country  --  elk will move to lower elevations and spend more time on wind-bared , south-facing slopes . And they 'll string out along migration corridors , typically the edges of dense timber on ridges that drop into sagebrush flats and even farm fields . Learning to recognize these seasonal habitats is half the work . The other half is making sure that elk are actively using these areas . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hunt , move to a place where you do , " says Harju . Early in the season , look for freshly packed mud and trampled grass around remote springs , seeps and streams . These mud wallows will be used by rutting bulls , but also by cows that want to cool off and give themselves a caked-mud armor against biting insects . Keep an ear tuned to bugling bulls , especially in the first and last light of day , and even in the middle of the night . Later in the season , look for zigzagging tracks in the fresh snow of high meadows . Elk will paw away the snow to get to the grass . And in any season , fresh scat and tracks are good evidence that elk are in the neighborhood . " People get locked into hunting a certain place , maybe a place where they 've seen elk in the past , " says Harju . " But a lot of things can cause elk to move  --  seismic trucks , logging activity , livestock-grazing patterns , previous hunting pressure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or two , pull up stakes and find a place where you do . " It may be in some dark hellhole on the far side of a mountain , Harju says , but accessing inaccessible spots is often the price of success . " There is no place an elk will go that I wo n't go , " he says . " I may have to cut the elk into smaller pieces to get it out , but if you prepare you can always find a way to get it out . " Hunt Quiet Though he 's only 16 years old , Tim Walker from Yacoult , Wash. , has tagged four bulls , three of them on general-tag hunts in western Washington 's thick , brambly timber . " We have some good spots to hunt , but they 're not exclusive places , " says his uncle and hunting partner , Gary Walker . " We generally hunt public land that 's closed to vehicles . We ride mountain bikes three or four miles from the gate , then hunt on foot from there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We hunt a lot of dense , thick , old-growth Douglas fir stands with screens of really nasty undergrowth , so you have to be able to move slowly and quietly . Last year Tim forgot his hunting boots  --  he is a teenager , after all  --  so he borrowed some cork-soled logging boots from his dad . He just could n't be quiet in those boots , so he took them off and walked for three or four hours in only his wool socks . He 's willing to do just about anything to get close to elk . " Harju 's favorite tactic for hunting down bulls in dense timber is to strike a faint game trail and slowly and silently move through the underbrush . " If you wear clothes that swish , you 'll never get close to an elk in the timber , " he says . " I do n't care how much they cost or what they look like  --  if your clothes make noise , throw them away and wear something that does n't . Then slow down and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can detect even tiny movements and sounds . You 'll never see a whole elk , but you will see parts and pieces . You have to look for patches of yellow and tan . I 've seen a lot of butts or the flick of an ear that gave away a bedded cow . " In dense timber , your nose can be your most lethal asset . " Elk stink , " says Harju . " If you 're walking into the wind and smell a rich , musky scent , get ready . You 're into elk , and in the timber they 're almost always closer than you think . " Work the Weather If there 's a trump card you can play in pursuit of a general-tag elk , it comes in the form of blinding snow and bitter temperatures . Winter weather not only moves elk from the comfort of their hidden refuges , but it makes them easy to track . " If you can hunt when there 's some snow on the ground , then you 'll see more elk , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know whether you 're looking at fresh or old sign . And elk are moving more because they have to eat more often when it gets cold . " Snow may be the great equalizer for elk hunters , but Harju cautions that it needs to be the right kind of snow . " If you can hunt immediately after a deep , soft , cold snow , do n't wait around , " he says . " But when we get wet snow that crusts over with ice , you may have to wait to hunt until ten or eleven in the morning , when the sun softens the surface . Crunchy snow is worse than no snow at all , because you 'll make so much noise you 'll never get close to an elk . " Shoot a Cow Nearly every general-tag elk hunter dreams of encountering a behemoth bull with battle-scarred antlers . The reality is that only a small percentage of hunters kill big bulls , and those who pass on young bulls or cows often regret their selectivity . " A good elk hunter hunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt big bulls . The hunters who kill the most elk do n't care what kind of elk it is , as long as it 's legal . They 've hunted long enough that they know to take an opportunity when it 's presented . Sometimes the opportunity takes the shape of a mature bull , but more often it takes the form of a cow or a young bull . " Most states in the West have too many elk for the available habitat , and wildlife agencies have made cow permits easy to draw  --  they 're even available over the counter in some states . Harju says these antlerless licenses are a perfect gateway opportunity for first-time elk hunters . " Start with cows , and once you learn how to hunt elk you can move up to a bull license , " he says . " But you ca n't learn without getting a license , and hunting cows will teach you all you need to know about where elk live and how to kill them . " Dwayne Andrews , a longtime elk hunter from Miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great trophy . " Any elk is a good elk , and the best elk is the one in my freezer , " he says . " If you 're able to shoot a cow , you 're more successful than seventy-five percent of the hunters out there , and you 'll have several hundred pounds of meat and great memories to show for it . Everybody wants to shoot a trophy bull , and it 's fine to hold out for one . Just do n't complain when you do n't kill one . " Harry Harju 's first elk hunts were as unsuccessful as they were grueling , and he concluded that luck  --  both bad and good  --  was the silent partner of all elk hunters . Over nearly 40 years of hunting , he has modified his judgment . " Elk are killed because of a hunter 's luck every season , but I 'm convinced that those hunters who learn about elk behavior and work the hardest are the luckiest . " BOX SNOW SMARTS Get hunting right after a deep , soft snow . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro . Wait too long and the snow will crust over , making a silent stalk nearly impossible . BOX WHERE TO LOOK Early in the season , look for elk on cool , north-facing slopes up high . When it snows , elk will move lower and congregate on bare , south-facing slopes . BOX GO WHERE AN ATV CAN NOT Getting to remote , hard-to-reach hunting grounds gives you a huge advantage over hunters cruising around in trucks or ATVs . BOX FOLLOW YOUR NOSE Elk stink , and you 'll often catch their scent before you see or hear them , especially when you 're moving through thick cover .
