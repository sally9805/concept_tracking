The Stepmother By Diamond , Diana St. Martin 's Paperbacks Diamond , Diana Time ! " Charlene Hendricks announced , clicking the button on her stopwatch . " Another minute , " Steven Armstrong gasped . His breathing was labored as he pedaled furiously on the stationary bicycle . " I can go for another minute ! " " That 's enough ! " she insisted . " Let 's not overdo it . You strain something and you 're back to square one . Just stay with the program . " Steven stopped pedaling and slumped forward over the handlebars . Charlene draped a fresh towel over his shoulders and offered him an open bottle of water . He took a drink , then wiped his face with the towel . " You know I can do a lot more than you 're letting me , " he said . " You 're doing more than enough . I do n't want you trying to break the world record for knee surgery . It takes time , and patience . " Steven managed to laugh even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of time , and I 've never been big on patience . Believe me , Charlie , the knee is fine . I 'm just trying to work off the paunch I got from all that time in bed . " She looked at him skeptically . " What paunch ? You 're in great shape . " " Nah ! I used to ride twice as long without even breaking a sweat . " " Sure , " she agreed , " when you were in your thirties and forties . But for a man in his sixtiesyou 're way above the curve . You know the rule in personal training : Act your age . " She took her warm-up jacket out of her backpack and put it on over her tank top . " Tomorrow at one o'clock , Mr. Armstrong ? " " Steve ! " he snapped angrily . " I keep telling you to call me Steve . " " Okay , Steve , I 'll see you tomorrow , same time , same place . " She started toward the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " Charlie ! Do I really look like I 'm in my sixties ? " When she looked back , he seemed desperate . " No , Mr. Armstrong , you look twenty years younger . And now that you 're shaving your head you look like a stud ! " He smiled and ran his hand over the dark haze that had been a crown of wild hair surrounding a bald pate . " You like this ? " " It 's a turn-on , " she smiled . " I can hardly keep my hands off you . " She was out the door when he called to her again . " Charlie ! " She poked her head back into the room . " I 'm going to swim some laps . Why do n't you stick around so you can tell me what I 'm doing wrong ? " She raised her hands in a gesture of helplessness . " I have to pick up my kid . You can hold off on the laps until tomorrow . We 'll do them as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway . Steven was still looking at the space she had vacated when he heard the front door snap shut . A few seconds later he heard the telltale rattle of her antique Toyota . She had just left , but already he missed her . Charlene Hendricks had come into his life along with a steel and epoxy hinge that had been substituted for his fatally damaged knee . Steven had resisted the knee replacement for over a year , managing to get by on a combination of painkillers and grit . Hell , he did n't build his hardware empire by pandering to every ache and pain . Thirty-three years on the job and he had missed only three days of work -- one when each of his children was born . Even after he 'd taken the company public and retired to his role of disgruntled share owner , he still kept himself busy . He had designed his new home on the Fort Lauderdale waterway , and then become his own construction contractor . Every cement block , every plumbing fixture , every truss and tile had passed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hardware . Nobody was going to put anything over on him ! Then the boat ! He had bought a seventy-five-foot motor yacht with a planing hull and twin diesels , and then supervised every step of its construction from laying the resin to installing the running lights . He had been climbing the ladder from the after deck to the flying bridge when his knee buckled under him . The doctors prescribed a new knee , a prosthesis that would replace the worn joint he had overworked . Steven had absolutely refused . There was nothing wrong with his knee that a little time would n't heal . He would simply suck it up the way he had always done when ailments threatened to slow his pace . The doctors shrugged . " When it hurts enough , you 'll come back , " they assured him . He had struggled for ten months , laboring to move around his house during the day , and sitting with his knee iced at night . Eventually , he had decided that the doctors were right and signed up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right after the operation and introduced herself as his therapist . She had helped him out of bed and supported him as he took his first faltering steps on his new knee . Then she went home with him to help him in the arduous task of rehabilitation . At first , Steven had wondered why he needed her . He could stretch his own muscles , do his own leg lifts , and climb aboard the stationary bicycle . Why did he need her to twist his legs and stretch his back , or count his repetitions ? But slowly he had learned to value her advice and to welcome her company during the grueling hours that he would have been spending alone . Then , halfway through his recovery , he had begun to notice her not as a professional trainer but as a woman . A very attractive woman , totally different from his deceased wife , the mother of his children . He noticed the rivulets of sweat that trickled down from her headband when she ran beside him , and the stains that spread down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptured muscles in her legs , the firmness of her thighs , and the tight buns that pressed into her leotards . Her waist , which frequently flashed as her shirt rose , was slim and flat . The breasts that showed when she bent toward him were firm and erect . Charlene , he had decided , was a new kind of woman , not soft , nor gentle , nor modestly ashamed of her femininity . She was spare , strong , and confident , invariably upbeat and annoyingly capable . As he had worked with her , he had realized that whatever other admirable characteristics she had , she could probably run him into the ground . Steven found himself competing with her . He 'd be damned if a woman young enough to be his daughter was going to be quicker , stronger , or more durable than he was . If she could demonstrate leg lifts with twenty pounds of weight , then he would do thirty pounds . If she could raise the treadmill to fifteen degrees , then he would turn it to twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much , and basked in the admiration she had for his determination . In the six weeks of his rehabilitation , Charlene had become his physical and emotional partner . So Steven was not surprised when he realized that he was falling in love with her . But he was embarrassed . He had seen many men his age decide that they were still physically desirable to younger women , and then make asses of themselves as they pursued a ridiculous romance . Some had spent fortunes showering presents and trust funds on bon bons half their age . No fool like an old fool , he had thought , shaking his head in despair . Was that what he was becoming ? An old fool ! Charlie was in her thirties , the same age range as all three of his children . He was old enough to be her father . Hell , he could be her grandfather ! What was her first rule of rehabilitation ? Act your age ! It 's not the same thing , he tried to reason with himself . Charlie and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after day ? Were n't they matching each other pound for pound and stride for stride ? Had n't she told him time after time that he was way ahead of his age group in his physical strength and endurance ? What was it she had called him -- a stud ! She did n't talk to him as if he was old enough to be her father . Maybe that was n't the way she thought about him . But then he laughed at himself . Act your age ! What in God 's name could he possibly offer a woman like Charlie ? More than likely she had her pick of any number of guys her own age . Virile guys with six-pack abs and rock-hard buns , and erections that could lift a woman off her feet . Why would she be interested in an old man with bad knees ? On the other hand , there were things he could offer that most younger men could n't match . He was worth $200 million , so he could provide her with a sense of security that she had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to count for something ! There was his house , a modern design on the inland waterway just north of Fort Lauderdale , that had made the cover of Architectural Digest . It had to be twice as luxurious as the nicest dream house she had ever imagined . There was the yacht , with its implied promises of faraway places . And the simple comfort of knowing she could have anything she wanted . But Charlie was n't mercenary . The most important thing in her life was her daughter , a thirteen-year-old whom she loved without reservation , and whose future was infinitely more important to her than her own . Steven knew that he could change the young girl 's life . She could be in private school instead of in one of those left-behind public schools . She could be tutored in art , music , horsemanship , whatever might interest her . Her college education would be assured . Not many young studs could handle all that ! Was he trying to buy her ? Perish the thought ! Buying was when you wanted something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing was tallying up the joys he could bring to her life . He was a man of means with global clout who would love , honor , and protect her . It was up to her to decide whether all that was more valuable than great buns . If he decided to ask her , how would he do it ? The easy way would be to simply keep her on as his personal trainer , three hours a day , six days a week . He could pay her lavishly so that she could afford to spend more time with him , perhaps bring her daughter to the house or out on the boat for trips to the Bahamas and the Keys . Foster the relationship until the next step was inevitable . Or , he could do what he had always done with a difficult decision . Bite the bullet and put it to her squarely . I love you . I ca n't bear the thought of you leaving . Please marry me so that you and your daughter can be my new family . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she showed up at his door . Except she might break out laughing before she knew that he was serious . That would be the most crushing defeat of his entire life . Or , she might explain patiently that lots of men thought they were in love with their personal trainers . It was a hazard of the occupation , and she certainly would n't hold it against him . A patronizing evasion would be much more painful than an outright refusal . What should he do ? Steven vacillated during his dinner and during his evening walk along the beach . He tossed and turned the entire night . The one thing that he was certain of was that he could n't live without Charlie nearby . The one thing he feared was that he was just another old fool .
