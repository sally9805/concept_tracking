Section : ELECTION 2006 AFTERSHOCKS <p> This is how a revolution ends . Not with a bang , or a " thumping , " as President George W. Bush called the 2006 Republican defeat at the polls , but with a misdirected phone call and a certain sinking feeling that even the most well-intentioned politicians can grow weary of rectitude and sell out their principles for the right price . <p> The scene happened almost 10 years ago , when the GOP revolution in the House of Representatives was still fresh , less than three years after Newt Gingrich and his promise of a Republican " Contract With America " had swept aside four decades of Democratic rule in the House . The House in that summer of 1997 was considering passage of its annual transportation bill , routinely a fat pork sausage of legislation , larded with goodies  --  bridges , tunnels , exit ramps , highway extensions  --  for individual congressmen to take home to their districts . A band of a dozen true believers from the Class of ' 94 , the congressmen first elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small room off the floor of the House . They were trying to plot some way to slow down or stop the pork-stuffed bill  --  to show that the GOP was still true to its campaign promises to cut profligate government spending . <p> The phone rang . According to one of the congressmen in the room , Joe Scarborough , another congressman  --  Steve Largent , a former NFL wide receiver and one of the leaders of the group  --  picked up the receiver and absentmindedly mumbled , " Yeah . " At the other end of the line , Largent heard the voice of Elmer G. ( Bud ) Shuster , the all-powerful , all-beneficent chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure . Shuster , an unabashed practitioner of old-style politics , was notorious in the House for rounding up votes by dispensing highway projects to pliable congressman . Shuster apparently did not recognize Largent 's voice over the phone . The chairman thought he had instead reached a different congressman  --  who shall remain nameless in this retelling , but who was well known at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " standing up against the Man . " Dictating quickly at the other end of the line , Bud Shuster was in a hurry  --  like Santa Claus on Christmas Eve , he had a lot of deliveries to make . Without pausing for pleasantries , he ticked off five highway projects worth $70 million , the reward to the supposedly high-minded congressman for swallowing his scruples  --  just this once !  --  and voting for the 1997 transportation bill . Package delivered , Shuster hung up . <p> Largent , the ringleader of the plotters , put down the phone and tried not to show his disappointment that one of their fellow do-gooders had apparently given in to temptation . Instead , as Scarborough recalls the story , Largent sardonically announced , " Well , I do n't think Congressman X is going to be with us this time . " The others in the room dryly laughed , but it was a demoralizing moment , recalls Scarborough . " You get beaten down , " says the MSNBC talk-show host . ( Contacted by NEWSWEEK , Largent , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall the phone call ; Shuster could not be reached for comment . ) Scarborough told NEWSWEEK that it became a " running joke " for members of the Class of ' 94 to say to each other , " Well , there goes the revolution , " every time one of their Contract With America reforms  --  like imposing term limits on members of Congress  --  was abandoned by lawmakers intoxicated with power . <p> Was the fall of the Republican revolution as predictable as the fall of man ? Did the GOP revolutionaries , like so many revolutionaries before them , have to become the very thing they had once vowed to change ? Gingrich , the former House Speaker , who stepped down in late 1998 before he could be pushed out , blames his successors for taking the low road to disaster . With his fondness for alliterative lists , Gingrich cites four areas where the Republicans fell short or went astray : " Candor , competence , corruption and consultants . " He specifically blames former majority leader Tom DeLay , who effectively replaced Gingrich as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Gingrich 's judgment , DeLay , as well as other Republican leaders , threw away the power of ideas in their narrow focus on self-preservation . " When an institution develops ' the Hammer ' as a model , that 's not the most intellectual form of leadership , " says Gingrich , alluding to DeLay 's nickname , earned for his skill at enforcing party loyalty in the handing out of favors to lobbyists and influence peddlers . ( DeLay did not respond to NEWSWEEK 's requests for comment . ) <p> But Gingrich deserves some of the blame himself for providing a grandiose and ultimately weak model of leadership . The story of the rise and fall of the Republican revolution in the House of Representatives is a timeless story of vanity and hubris  --  and a cautionary tale for incoming Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the new Democratic leaders , who would like to inaugurate another long period of their party 's rule . <p> The Republican revolution hardly started with Gingrich . The seeds were planted by the GOP 's failed but visionary 1964 presidential candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Reagan landslide of 1980 brought the movement to power in the White House and the Senate , which the GOP held until 1986 . <p> The House , however , long seemed a lost cause ; it had not been in GOP hands since the first two years of Eisenhower 's presidency . It was Gingrich who first saw a way to exploit growing public dissatisfaction with the old Democratic barons of big government in the House , Speaker Thomas P. ( Tip ) O'Neill of Massachusetts and his successor , Jim Wright of Texas . Gingrich , then an obscure Republican backbencher ( O'Neill referred to him as a " stooge , " as in the Three Stooges ) , used a new forum  --  C-Span  --  to rail against Democratic corruption . In 1989 , somewhat surprisingly , he succeeded in forcing the resignation of Speaker Wright , who was implicated in a scheme to profit off book sales in violation of House rules . <p> Gingrich had been a bit of a joke even in his own party . The son of a military officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a soldier wanna-be who had missed Vietnam ( student and family deferments ) . Gingrich spouted a kind of utopian futurism about the " opportunity society " and handed out tapes so other congressmen could learn , as the accompanying instructions put it , to " talk like Newt . " Some congressmen made fun of the tapes . But others listened  --  and learned . The 1994 congressional campaign was a referendum on big government  --  Hillary Clinton had launched a massive health-care reform plan that wound up strangled by its own red tape . Gingrich mounted an attack on the " bureaucratic welfare state " that caught the public mood  --  and shocked the pundits and prognosticators by returning the Republicans with a 26-seat majority in the House . <p> Suddenly it was Speaker Gingrich . Irrepressible , he launched biting personal attacks on the First Lady , chortling , " We are a happy band of Vikings , who do n't mind a fight ! " More seriously , he led a campaign that summer to cut federal spending and succeeded in squeezing $50 billion out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gingrich 's attempt to trim spending on medical care for the elderly does not seem that extreme  --  he wanted to restrain the rate of growth from 10 percent a year to 7 percent over seven years . But he immediately ran into a political buzz saw . <p> Gingrich compared his leadership style to that of Charles de Gaulle , Thomas Edison and Winston Churchill ; he likened his legislative gambits to the battle strategies of the Duke of Wellington and Ulysses S. Grant . " Newt could n't help himself , " recalled Dick Armey , then Gingrich 's House majority leader . " He was always just as grand as he could be . " At first , President Bill Clinton seemed so diminished by the midterm humiliation that he had to argue that he was " still relevant " at a press conference in the spring of 1995 . But by summer , after handling the tragic terror attack on the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City with grace , the president was secretly conferring with an old political consultant , Dick Morris , who was reminding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At Morris 's urging , Clinton launched a demagogic but extremely effective advertising campaign accusing the Republicans of trying to " eliminate " Medicare . <p> In October ' 95 , Clinton held a press conference at which he charged that the Republicans were cutting health care by $200 billion so that they could give the same amount of money back to the wealthy as tax breaks . Joe Scarborough was watching with some fellow freshman from the Class of ' 94 . " I remember we broke out laughing , saying , ' That poor fool ' , " Scarborough recalled . The joke was on the Republicans . As the budget battle turned into a stalemate later that fall , the government shut down . Clinton blamed the Republicans , darkly warning that Social Security checks would no longer be mailed out . The president repeatedly outfoxed Gingrich . When Gingrich flew on Air Force One to the funeral of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , Clinton declined to find and negotiate a budget solution ( preferring , instead , to play hearts up front with business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their return  --  and the New York Daily News ( owned by Zuckerman ) ran a front-page cartoon of Gingrich in diapers ( which the Democrats made into a poster and , in a mischievous violation of House rules , stuck on the Speaker 's chair ) . Gingrich ultimately caved in and had to plead with his own hard-liners to reopen the government . <p> Clinton continued to outflank Gingrich , effectively stealing much of the Republican platform by being tough on crime and welfare and declaring that the era of big government was over . Worn down , Gingrich privately confessed , " I 'm not a natural leader . I 'm a natural intellectual gadfly . " Even after Clinton was consumed by the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998 , Gingrich was unable to lead ; his own troops were already plotting to purge him . <p> Gingrich 's resignation after the 1998 election ( the Republicans lost five seats ) brought on an interlude that could only be described as comic opera . At the height of the Clinton impeachment proceedings , the new House Speaker-designate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hustler magazine , Larry Flynt , placed an ad in The Washington Post offering up to a million dollars for information about sexual indiscretions by D.C. officials . After a story broke in the press , Livingston admitted to extramarital affairs in a dramatic speech on the floor of the House . Livingston did not run for Speaker and resigned his seat . <p> Stunned Republicans chose a blandly amiable former high-school wrestling coach , Dennis Hastert , as their next Speaker . But the real power belonged to DeLay , who rose from whip to majority leader in 2003 . A former Houston pest exterminator and archfoe of the Environmental Protection Agency , DeLay gave off a cold , hard look that was the polar opposite of sunny Reaganism . He delighted in his " Hammer " nickname . From the beginning of Gingrich 's tenure , the GOP 's K Street offensive had warned lobbying firms along Washington 's K Street corridor that they would be wise to hire Republicans if they wanted access . There was nothing especially new about such a partisan approach to the influence-peddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle to study a past master at shaking the corporate tree  --  former representative Tony Coelho , the onetime chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee . But DeLay brought a new brazenness to the game . Before long , lobbyists could be seen in committee rooms writing legislation . With corporate coziness came the abandonment of fiscal restraint . Committee chairmen now routinely handed out " earmarks , " special provisions authorizing spending for members ' pet projects . In 1987 , President Ronald Reagan vetoed a highway bill because it had 152 earmarks . In 2005 , President Bush signed a transportation bill with 6,371 earmarks . <p> The nadir of the delay era may have come in the early-morning hours of Nov. 23 , 2003 . The Republicans , who had once tried to cut back entitlement programs , were now voting to create a whole new one  --  a bill to provide prescription-drug benefits for the elderly . Normally , House members have 15 minutes to cast their votes . Instead , DeLay &; Co. kept the voting open for three hours  --  until 6 a.m.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The exact nature of the inducements has never been clear , but Rep. Nick Smith charged that " bribes and special deals were offered to convince members to vote yes . " ( For Smith 's vote , the leaders allegedly offered financial and political support for the congressional race of Smith 's son . ) The House ethics committee , effectively neutered in recent years , gave DeLay a wrist-slap reprimand . DeLay accepted the committee 's " guidance , " adding that he " would never knowingly violate the rules . " <p> The House took on a Darwinian feel . It was every man for himself as staffers and even lawmakers cashed in to become lobbyists . The number of registered lobbyists in Washington nearly doubled , to 37,000 , between 2000 and 2006 . About half of the 200-odd congressmen who left their seats after 1998 stayed in Washington to become lobbyists or consultants . They would use their privileges as retired congressmen to lobby in the House gym and even on the House floor . <p> It was perhaps inevitable that the culture of sleaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two downtown restaurants and his skybox at the sports arena , Abramoff was a popular host to congressmen and staffers . He was positively gleeful about bilking his clients , ultimately liberating several Indian tribes of $82 million in fees . " I wish those moronic Tiguas were smarter in their political contributions , " Abramoff e-mailed Ralph Reed , his friend and the former head of the Christian Coalition . " I 'd love us to get our mitts on that moolah ! " When Abramoff finally pleaded guilty to fraud , he effectively took DeLay down with him . Several of DeLay 's former staffers were caught up in the Abramoff scandal . DeLay was not charged with any wrongdoing , but he was embarrassed by an all-expenses-paid golfing trip to Scotland with Abramoff . Under indictment for campaign-money laundering in Texas in a weak but nagging case brought by a local prosecutor , DeLay gave up his seat in June . ( He has pleaded not guilty ; the case has not gone to trial . ) <p> Hastert was never able to exercise the same iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority leader , John Boehner , able to bring real discipline to fractious House members who looked out primarily for their own political interests . The religious evangelicals became more demanding of the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill , leading to the deeply unpopular spectacle of the Terri Schiavo case . Last year Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist , eager to court religious conservatives for a possible presidential run , and the House leadership , sensitive to the religious right , intervened to try to keep the patient alive on a feeding tube , a questionable use of federal power , especially for a party that once stood for less government interference . <p> The GOP 's evangelical base was shocked and demoralized this fall when Rep. Mark Foley of Florida was exposed for having sent salacious messages to congressional pages . House leaders blamed each other for not responding to warnings that Foley was a possible sexual predator . In early October , when Hastert was compelled to hold a press conference to announce that he would not step down as Speaker , it was clear that the GOP revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Republicans might have kept control of Congress had it not been for GOP overreaching on a different front  --  Iraq . In some ways , the hubris of Gingrich and DeLay was minor compared with the willful risk-taking of President Bush , backed by Vice President Dick Cheney , a former congressman from Wyoming . <p> History is full of accidents and what-ifs . Cheney was the second-ranking House Republican when he got the call to become secretary of Defense in 1989 , at the beginning of the George H.W. Bush administration . ( Bush 's original nominee to become SecDef , former senator John Tower of Texas , was disqualified by allegations that he was a tippling womanizer . ) Had Tower not been blocked from taking office , and Cheney not chosen as his Pentagon replacement , Cheney probably would have stayed in the House  --  and become Speaker when the Republicans won in 1994 . " If Cheney had stayed I never would have gone in the leadership , " Gingrich told NEWSWEEK last week . Gingrich rated Cheney as a perhaps less imaginative but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House and not become a war-hawk adviser to both Presidents Bush , history might well have taken a different course . We will never know . But we do know this : Democrats who , in the glow of victory , now say that none of this could happen to them ignore the story of the last dozen years at their peril . A Long Drought <p> The last time the GOP lost the House to Democrats , it took the party 40 years to regain power .
