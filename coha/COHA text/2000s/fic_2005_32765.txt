Chapter One New York City Serenade This is not spring , Eric Banyon thought grumpily , looking around at the grey sky and the patches of dirty ice that still lingered in sheltered areas around the edges of buildings here on the Upper East Side . I have seen spring , and this is not it . Even though spring 's official beginning was a week and more away , it was March , and in Southern California it was already T-shirt weather . And Underhill , snow was purely for decoration . But he was neither in California nor Underhill . He was in Manhattan , and it had been a long , bitter , wet winter , one that seemed to intend to hang on long past the time when any polite season would have known it was no longer wanted . He 'd graduated Juilliard at the semester break in February-either ahead of or behind his class , depending on how you looked at it-but he 'd been considering a number of possibilities for what to do with his shiny new degree since late last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't sure whether you 'd call it " paying back , " " paying forward , " or just staying out of trouble . It was n't as if he needed to work in any financial sense-kenned gold from Elfhame Misthold took care of that , and even if it had n't , all he hadto do was hint to Ria that he wanted paying gigs and he 'd be doing society weddings and political banquets every night and day of the week , and for big fat fees . But Eric knew he sure did n't want to waste that degree on becoming a live and expensive version of Muzak-and he also doubted he 'd be comfortable just sitting around in front of the TV all day-or even for more than the length of the average movie . He had n't come back into the World Above from a very comfortable life Underhill just to turn into a slacker . Yes , his initial reason for coming back into the World Above had been to finish what he 'd started-primarily his degree-and he 'd done that . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew what a mess the world was in . He needed to be doing something . Doing good , in fact . He was pretty sure this counted , in a small way . And it left him free for the big things that came up from time to time . Although on days like this-raw , cold , windy , and almost-but-not-quite raining-he really wished he did n't have to make house calls . He trudged along with his head down against the weather until he sensed an indefinable change in his surroundings , looked up , found he 'd reached the address he was heading for , and went in , nodding to the doorman . Since he 'd started his new gig before he 'd graduated , Esai passed him with a smile and a nod : Eric was a familiar face here . He stopped at the front desk to give his name and destination , and waited while they called and checked-both his ID , and whether he was expected . A dearth of uninvited and unexpected guests was only one of the many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a building like this . * * * Vicki , the incredibly discreet au pair , greeted him at the door and led him into the music room . Vicki was of the sort described as " a treasure " - so polite , so polished , so flawlessly invisible that Eric would have suspected an import from Stepford if he had n't caught Vicki and her charge-and sometimes Vicki and her employer-miming the occasional wordless comment in " womanspeak " behind his back . Sometimes at his expense . He did n't mind ; it made him feel better to know that she was n't some cowed little thing , trapped in the walls of this gilded cage , subdued into the " appropriate " image . Belinda Tienhoven , Eric 's real reason for being here , was waiting for him eagerly , her flute already assembled , blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail with a plaid bow that matched her school-uniform skirt . It was bizarre to think that here in Manhattan , where rent for an efficiency the size of an Underhill closet was so high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the money to spend to have rooms devoted only to music . Then again , where on earth would you put that monster hi-fi set out of the fifties that was Ian Tienhoven 's pride and joy , except a room devoted only to music ? For crying out loud , the thing was the size of a van ! It had tubes , tubes the size of mustard-jars , for chrissake ! Eric was half afraid to go near it . He kept expecting Ian to rise up out of the middle of it , hair on end , shouting , " It 's alive ! It 's alive ! " He gave it the usual uneasy glance as he pulled up his own chair . Vicki and Belinda exchanged the usual amused glance . Then Vicki settled into a chair in the corner with her needlepoint-Eric had discovered it seemed to be an unwritten rule that nannies , governesses , and au pairs all did needlepoint-and the music lesson began . When Eric had made up his mind to set up as a private music tutor , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the same kind of over-scheduled , over-achieving , way-above-middle-class kids he had been . Kids whose parents could well afford a Juilliard graduate as a private music teacher . It would look rather odd , after all , if none of his pupils could afford to pay for their lessons , and he had plenty of sliding-scale and pro-bono students on his books . When he 'd made his decision to teach , he 'd remembered his own experiences with private teachers-most of them had only cared about pleasing their clients , and those had been the parents , not the pupils . And his parents had only been interested in how well he performed , not whether he 'd enjoyed learning . That had been almost enough to make him abandon the idea of teaching then and there . It had been Hosea who pointed out that it was certainly up to Eric to decide what sort of teacher he was going to be-and that if he did run into any parents like that in the course of his work , he 'd be in the best position possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hosea-Eric 's Bardic student and friend-had said , " can be a great comfort , even when everything else in yore life is a mite dark . " That had made sense to Eric . In fact , if he had gotten the kind of teacher that he himself intended to be , there might not have been that incident with the Nightflyers .... And he just might have stuck with Juilliard the first time . But whether it was sheer luck , or whether because parents raising trophy kids went after trophy teachers , Eric had been fortunate so far . His high-end students might not see a lot of their parents . They might have schedules of activities that would drive a CEO to exhaustion . But they were n't being treated as objects-and he had it in his power to make their music lessons into times of relaxation instead of stress . Belinda Tienhoven , for example , was studying the flute because she liked the flute . She was pretty good , too . He 'd been better at her age-but then , he 'd been practicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-hour of practice out of her a day , since she was also taking soccer , ballet , riding , and French-and those were just her after-school activities . For the first half hour of the lesson they worked on drills-fingering , breath-control-and then on a short solo piece . After that came Belinda 's favorite part of the lesson : the duet . Small wonder ; that was when Eric used a bit of Bardic magic to heal some of the damage that her killer schedule was doing to her . Eric had adapted a Mozart " Rondo in A " for the purpose , making sure it would be challenging but not too difficult . They alternated parts ; this week Belinda had the lead . They managed a complete play-through once without disaster , though Eric had a bit of work to keep everything on an even keel . But when he 'd taken up teaching , he 'd made a firm vow that if lessons were n't going to be all fun all the time-since nothing involving drill and repetition could be-they definitely were n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own student days . And he 'd vowed that even if his pupils were so unprepared that their duet consisted of " Variations on Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star , " every lesson was going to end on a good , pleasurable note , and his pupils would finish up feeling happier and more relaxed than they 'd been when they started the hour . Every time you use your Gift to make something better , no matter how small the change , you add Light to the World Above . That had been Dharniel 's admonition the last time he 'd seen the crusty old Elven warrior . So here he was , lighting his tiny little candles in what seemed these days to be a very dark city indeed . Did it make a difference ? He had to believe it did , or what was the point ? When they brought the piece to an end , Eric was startled to hear enthusiastic clapping . Karen Tienhoven-Belinda 's mother-was standing in the doorway , still in her coat-a garment whose tailoring was so impeccable that Eric had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she worked hard for that money , and so did her husband . " Wonderful ! " she said , beaming , as Belinda hastily set down her flute and ran over for a hug . They looked like sisters ; clear enough where Belinda got her fair coloring from . " I 'm sorry to say I only heard the end of it-but you 're playing very well , darling . I 'm only here for a few minutes , I 'm afraid . It 's going to be another late night at work , but I thought we could have a snack together and then I could run you and Vicki up to your dance practice in the car . What do you think of that ? " Belinda squeaked , sounding like any typical eleven-year-old promised a special treat , and nodded enthusiastically . She managed to remember her manners far enough to thank Eric for her lesson , then ran off to get her dance bag . Vicki had already tactfully vanished . Mrs. Tienhoven sighed . " Sometimes I think I 'm missing her childhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a teenager . But this brief wo n't wait . And some people-naming no names of course-seem to think it 's their right to pave the entire city over . But you are n't interested in a high-priced lawyer 's problems , Mr. Banyon . How is Belinda doing ? " The question every teacher dreaded , Eric thought with an inward grimace . Still , even if Belinda was n't a child prodigy , she was a good , proficient student , at or above her expected level . " She 's making real progress . And she seems to enjoy it . If you 're asking me if she has the talent to be a professional musician ... " " Oh , good heavens , no . " Karen Tienhoven waved the idea away . " It 's much too soon to tell , do n't you think ? No ... you see , we 're planning to go away this summer . To Italy . For a month-or six weeks , if Ian and I can both get away . So if she 's doing well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her to stop her lessons for that long . So I wondered if you 'd like to come with us ? We 'd pay all your expenses , of course . " Eric shook his head , smiling gently . " I really do n't think I could get away for that long . But there are a lot of senior Juilliard students who are free over the summer who might be available . I know several studious young ladies who would really enjoy teaching someone like Belinda .... I could make some inquiries , if you 'd like . " Mrs. Tienhoven thought about that for a moment-probably reflecting that , all things considered , a studious young lady might make a better traveling companion for Belinda-and Vicki-than a studly young man , like one Eric Banyon . Danger , danger , Will Robinson ! Romantic Italy-the tutor and the au pair cooped up in the hotel together-Belinda 's mother smiled , and if there was a touch of gratitude in that smile for having narrowly escaped a-situation-well , Eric pretended not to see it . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might be the perfect solution . Thank you , Mr. Banyon. " * * * A few minutes later , Eric was headed cross-town , his check-in its discreet envelope-tucked into his pocket , having made a mental note to check with his former classmates to see who might be interested in an all-expense-paid trip to Italy this summer . Assuming , of course , that Belinda was interested . She might not be . And certainly there was plenty else to do in Italy . Six weeks would n't make that big a difference in the playing of a child who had the normal dose of talent , as long as she kept up her practicing . And even if she didn't-well , who cared ? There were plenty of other ways Belinda Tienhoven could make a living when she grew up , including following in her mother 's footsteps . Eric grinned to himself . The scene he 'd just left had all the elements of his childhood but one : Belinda Tienhoven obviously was n't a trophy , but a prize . Treasured . Loved . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its inmates as Cooties and Runt-was located in the East 50s . The prospectus said that it prepared its students for life . The parents of most of the students simply hoped it would prepare them for college . Neither Eric nor Magnus had been thrilled with the idea of Magnus 's enrollment there-Magnus , because he had n't wanted to go to school at all ; Eric , because he 'd never had a good experience with private schools , and knew perfectly well that his younger brother had n't either . It was Ria who had pointed out-patiently , firmly , and , as usual , inarguably-that Magnus 's academic background was spotty at best , and moreover , the false history they were constructing for him in order for Eric to gain custody of him meant that they could n't use his real background anyway . He 'd need a solid grounding at a good prep school to bring him up to speed if he wanted to get into any college at all-and according to Ria , the New York City public schools were a horror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an excellent record of college placement for its graduates . And unlike the previous schools Magnus had attended , the security was to keep trouble out , not students in . It was also , as Eric had quickly discovered , dauntingly expensive and impossible to get into . The first was no problem for him , and the second , as he 'd discovered , was no problem for Ria . A place had been found for Magnus , who 'd started at the beginning of the winter erm . Eric had fought Nightflyers , Unseleighe Sidhe , and rogue government agents long before discovering that he had a teenaged brother he needed to take responsibility for . There were days when he thought that the Unseleighe Sidhe were less of a challenge . Much less . The C &A; required a blazer and tie . Not only did Magnus never get tired of complaining about that , he also never exhausted the possibilities of skating near the edges of the dress code , since the C &A; left the choice of tie for third- and fourth-year students-and Magnus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost-fights-no actual full-scale fights ; Eric had been spared that much-were always about Magnus having to go to school at all . Magnus 's stated intention was to become a drummer in a rock band . Drummers in rock bands were not known for flouting their CVs . Most of the drummers in rock bands that I 've known were barely able to speak three articulate words in a row . Maybe it was like his theory about sopranos-in the case of sopranos , the cranial cavity was naturally empty in order to help them reach the high notes with resonance . The vibrato , much like the pea in a whistle , was the small piece of brain rattling around in the skull . In the case of rock-band drummers , the cranial cavity was naturally empty due to being so close to the amps . Any brain material left alive after the amps got done with it was compacted into the size of a thumb . Oh that was n't fair . There was Neil Piert and the early Phil Collins .... Then again , there 's Sigu Sigu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were times when Eric really felt his actual age . Dropping a reference to something he remembered as being a household word , only to have Magnus stare at him blankly , tended to invoke those times . He reached the block of the school just as the doors opened and the students came swarming out . Some of them headed directly for the waiting vehicles-Lincoln Town Cars were the limousine of choice-others clustered on the sidewalk to talk to friends . Magnus stood at the top of the steps , looking around . He knows I 'm here , Eric thought with a pang of realization . He was n't sure how to feel about that . Magnus had n't known he was coming today , but he obviously sensed Eric 's presence on some level . Eric knew Magnus had the same Bardic Gift he did , though so far it had n't made its presence known in any obvious way . And Magnus knew that Eric was a Bard , though they had n't talked about it much . They were going to have to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be evaluated and trained .
