The phone was ringing . Ignore it , Eve told herself , her fingers moving swiftly on the skull reconstruction she 'd given the name of Marty . She could call whoever it was back when she was through working . The phone was set for speaker and she could pick up if it was Joe or Jane . She was getting too close to that important last step in the sculpting . On the sixth ring the answering machine picked up . " I need to speak to you . Answer the phone , Ms. Duncan . " She froze , her fingers stopped in midstroke . Luis Montalvo . Though she had spoken to him only twice that faint accent was unmistakable . " I know you 're there . You have n't left that cottage in the last week . " His voice became faintly mocking . " Your dedication is admirable and I understand you 're brilliant at your job . I look forward to having both focused soon on my behalf . " He paused . " Do pick up the phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . You do n't want to upset me . " And she did n't want to pick up the phone . He might jar her out of the zone of feverish intensity she needed when she was working this close to completion . Dammit , she had hoped he would n't call her again after she 'd turned him down when he 'd phoned her the last time , over a week ago . " I wo n't give up , you know . " No , he probably would n't . Montalvo had been polite during the first call and evenafter she 'd refused his offer , the second time he 'd phoned he 'd displayed no anger . His voice had been smooth and soft , almost regretful , yet there had been a note beneath that velvet courtesy that had puzzled her . It had made her uneasy then but tonight it filled her with impatience . She had no time for this now . Marty was waiting . She strode across the room and picked up the phone . " Montalvo , I 'm very busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me again . " " Ah , how delightful to hear your voice . I knew you would n't be so rude as to leave me hanging on that dreadful answering device . I hate impersonal machines . I 'm a man of emotion and passion and they offend me . " " I really do n't want to hear what you love or hate . I do n't care . I want to get off this phone and forget you exist . " " I realize that sad fact . You 're absorbed in your latest reconstruction , of that boy found buried in Macon . Have you named him yet ? I understand you name all the skulls you work on . " She stiffened . " How did you know that ? " " I know everything about you . I know you live with a Detective Joe Quinn of the Atlanta Police Department . I know you have an adopted daughter , Jane MacGuire . I know you 're possibly the best forensic sculptor in the world . Shall I go on ? " " That could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the boy murdered in Macon ? " " I have many , many contacts around the world . Do you want to know who killed him ? I could find out for you . " " I do n't believe you . " " Why not ? " " Because you 're not even in this country . You 're a scumbag of an arms peddler and you live in Colombia where you can hide out and deal your poison to the highest bidder . " He chuckled . " I do like frankness . Very few women I know are willing to tell me the truth as they see it . " " Then I 'm grateful to not be one of the women you ' know , ' you sexist bastard . If I were , I 'd probably be tempted to cut your nuts off . " " Such violence , such passion . I believe we 're very much alike , Ms. Duncan . " " No way . " She drew a deep breath . " The answer is still no . I 've no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You were very polite and businesslike , almost sympathetic , when I first made you the offer . The second time you were much more curt . I suppose you had Joe Quinn check me out ? " " Yes , of course . I do n't deal with crooks and murderers . " " Everyone deals with whoever can make them the best bargain . " " I told you the last time that I was n't interested in any of your fat fees . " " And I was duly impressed . I do n't believe I 've ever had anyone turn down a million dollars for a few days ' work . " " Dirty money . " " Not true . All my cash is very well laundered . " " I thought you 'd accepted that I would n't work for you . " " Because I did n't argue with you ? I do n't believe in spinning my wheels . I just go away and find another lure . It took almost a week for me to decide what that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be my guest in a very short time . " " Why ? " " That would spoil the surprise . I like to see a plan unfold like a beautiful night flower . " " You mentioned Joe and my adopted daughter . You touch them and I 'll kill you . " " That violence again . " His tone was amused . " I 'd never be that stupid . That would be the trigger that would send you into the fray to take me down . I want your cooperation . " " I 'm hanging up . " " Very well . I just wanted to offer you the opportunity to change your mind . It would make me happy if you would come to me for mercenary reasons . Much less stressful for all of us . " " Are you threatening me ? " " Heavens , no . You 'd know it if I were doing that . There would be no question . Wo n't you come and make me happy and become rich in the process ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good night . " He hung up . Eve slowly pressed the disconnect button . He had said he was n't threatening her , but what else could she call it ? It was subtle , but the threat was all the more chilling for the casual , understated way it was delivered . He 'd been so calm when she 'd turned down his offer that she 'd honestly thought he 'd accepted her refusal and was out of her life . It was clear she 'd been wrong . Should she call Joe and tell him Montalvo was still on the scene ? And have him think she was worried and rush home from the precinct ? She was n't worried . She was uneasy . Montalvo had said her family was safe and she believed him . As he had perceived , any danger to them would have made her angry and rebellious . He 'd made no direct threat at all and he might just be trying to intimidate her into doing his job . Maybe . Yet he 'd seemed to know entirely too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , she 'd definitely tell Joe . But there was no use in alarming him right now . She 'd tell him tonight when he came home for dinner . Okay , so she wanted to get back to Marty and she was afraid talking to Joe about Montalvo would keep her from doing it . She was n't about to let Montalvo disturb her concentration on her work . That slimeball would probably enjoy the thought that he could control her to that extent . He might even call her again and try to reinforce that control . She 'd be damned if she 'd let him . She turned off the house phone and then her cell phone before moving back toward the reconstruction on the easel across the room . Block Montalvo out of her thoughts . Think of Marty and the chance to bring him home . Think of the boy who 'd been murdered and buried and left alone with no name or place . That was better . Montalvo 's words were blurring , fading away as she began to work . Talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " Pity . " Montalvo looked down at the phone . " I was hoping she 'd give in to greed like a normal person . It 's easy to be noble for an hour , a day , but then they start to think and perhaps dream a little . A week should have whetted her appetite and made her start making excuses why she should take the job . " " Not everyone thinks that money is the be-all and end-all of everything , Montalvo , " Soldono said . Montalvo smiled . " Almost everyone . It 's unfortunate that Eve Duncan is in the minority . " He rose from the carved chair at the head of the dining table . " Oh , well . One must make adjustments . " Soldono tensed . " Do n't do it , Montalvo . " " She 's giving me little choice . You 're giving me little choice . You did n't talk to her , did you ? " He shook his head . " I told you what you had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see you scrambling frantically to avoid bringing her into the picture until time got away from you . Well , that time has come . " " Why her ? " Soldono asked . " There 's a fine forensic sculptor in Rio de Janeiro . Use him . " " Sanchez ? " Montalvo shook his head . " Technically brilliant but he 's not what I want . " " Eve Duncan is an American citizen and she 's known and respected by every police department on the planet . She turned down your money and you 'll be stirring up a hornet 's nest if you try to force her . " " And you would n't like that . The CIA tries to be very low-key these days . " " Let me try to get Sanchez for you . " " You do n't understand . " " Then tell me . " He gazed musingly down at the depths of the wine in his glass . " It 's a matter of passion . " " What ? " " I told Eve Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . " Soldono had n't noticed any emotion in Montalvo , much less a passion . The man was brilliant , innovative , and he kept any feelings or thoughts hidden behind that faintly mocking smile . " Why Eve Duncan ? " he repeated . " She has passion too . I 've studied her file and nothing could be clearer . It 's like a whirlwind spinning around her . She grew up on the streets with a drug addict for a mother and gave birth to an illegitimate child as a teenager . She turned her life around and went back to school and became a model mother . Then her daughter was kidnapped and presumably killed , but the body was never found . Instead of being crushed , the lady became a forensic sculptor and tried to bring closure to other parents by identifying the remains of their missing children . " " I know all that , " Soldono said impatiently . " You know the facts but you 've never studied Eve Duncan the way I have . I believe I may know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives her . I know what makes her tick . " " Yeah , sure . " He could n't keep the sarcasm from his tone . " Passion ? " " Do n't underestimate it . Da Vinci had it . Michelangelo had it . It 's the difference between art and creation . Eve Duncan has it . " His tone was smooth but hard . " And that 's why I have to have her . Do n't try to pawn anyone else off on me . " " Find another way . You promised me that you 'd " " And I 'd keep my promise if you 'd kept yours . " His tone was threaded with mockery as he continued , " But since the lady is not being accommodating , I must have cooperation from someone . You can see that , ca n't you ? " " No . " Montalvo 's smile faded . " Then your vision had better improve quickly . I told you yesterday that if I did n't get the answer I wanted , then I 'd move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll give you another four hours to persuade her , Soldono . No more , no less . " He looked at his watch . " Ten tonight . " " I ca n't strike a bargain like that . " " Of course you can . Do n't bullshit me . You do it all the time . A life for a life . " He turned away . " Finish your dinner . The tiramisu is magnificent . The chef will be upset if you do n't try it . " Soldono was seething with frustration as he watched him walk away . Sleek , graceful , and as dangerous as a stick of dynamite too near the flames . Bastard . Would he do it ? Why was he even questioning it ? Montalvo did n't bluff and he would carry out any threat he made in exactly the method he 'd outlined . He had four hours . He 'd hoped to find a way to stop Montalvo without involving Eve Duncan but time had run out . But was it to his advantage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it go ? He had to be sure it was worth it . Four hours . He reached for his phone and quickly dialed . " Montalvo 's given me four hours . Dammit , he 'll do it . How the hell am I supposed to stop him ? " Venable was silent for a moment . " It 's time you offered Eve Duncan a choice . " " Some choice . Okay , I 'm on it . I 'll call you back when I get through . " He hung up and looked in his book for Eve Duncan 's phone number . " Jane called me , " Joe said as he came into the cottage two hours later . " She tried to reach you but she could n't do it . She said she 'd made reservations for us at the Doubletree in Phoenix and that I was to remind you that the show was this Saturday . " He smiled . " I told her that there was a fairly good chance that you 'd remember . " " What ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was like fighting her way through a thick fog . " Of course I remembered . " Eve managed to tear her gaze away from Marty . " It 's a very important show for Jane . I would n't miss it . She should know that . " " Yeah . " He went over to the phone and turned it back on . " She also knows that you 've been working day and night to finish that reconstruction . " " Marty is difficult . " She looked back at the reconstruction of the eight-year-old boy . At least , the forensic team 's estimate was eight years . " I had to practically put his splintered facial bones back together before I could begin work . " " Do we have a clue who he is yet ? " She shrugged . " You know I never look at police files before I finish the reconstruction . The Macon police have photos of children who disappeared around the time that they estimate the boy was killed . We 'll see if we have a resemblance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . The DNA labs are so backed up with current murders that they 're not going to be in any hurry to process a five-year-old cold case . " She pushed the hair back from her forehead . " But if I do a good enough job I have a chance to bring him home . " " You 'll do a good job , " Joe said . " But not if you get so tired you lose judgment . " He headed for the kitchen . " Did you eat dinner ? " " I think so . . . I do n't remember . " " Then we 'll assume that you did n't . I 'll warm up the beef stew in the refrigerator and put some garlic bread in the oven . That means you have fifteen minutes to clean up your studio and wash up . " " I can catch something later . " " Now . " He opened the refrigerator . " Scoot . " She hesitated . Montalvo . She 'd meant to tell him about the call from Montalvo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem important now . As she 'd worked on the skull , everything had faded but the reality of the work itself . Marty was important . The other lost children were important . She 'd tell Joe about Montalvo later . " I should finish tonight . I want to do the computer three-D image before we leave for Phoenix . " " The boy 's been dead for five years . He can wait a little while longer . " He glanced at her over his shoulder . " No arguments , Eve . I let you wear yourself into the ground because you give me no choice , but not this time . You 'll have a fight on your hands . I 'd bet you 've lost five pounds this week .
