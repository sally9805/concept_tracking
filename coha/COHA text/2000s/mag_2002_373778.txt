Need cheering up ? Here 's a good news story . The world 's fifth largest country  --  with a history of military rule and endemic corruption  --  holds a free and fair presidential election . All voters , even in remote villages , cast their ballots on high-tech electronic machines of a kind that make the conduct of elections in , say , Florida , look shamefully outmoded . The candidate who wins the most support in the first round of voting has made his name criticizing the nation 's power elite . But the results are accepted by all , and the country begins a three-week campaign before the top two candidates square off in a second round . <P> Worth raising a glass to , right ? But all last week 's election in Brazil got from Wall Street was a Bronx cheer . The Brazilian currency , the real , continued a slide that , apart from a brief rally after an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) rescue package last August , has gone on all year . In the markets , interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which Wall Street regards investment in Brazil as a risk ) are running more than 20 percentage points above comparable U.S. securities . <P> No prizes for guessing why the markets are jumpy . The winner of the first round , with 46.4% of the vote , was Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  --  universally known as Lula  --  the candidate of the Workers ' Party , which has in the past flirted with repudiating Brazil 's massive external debt . Lula , 56 , a former labor-union leader running for the presidency for a fourth time , is likely to defeat Jose Serra , the candidate of the governing coalition , in the runoff on Oct.27 . Following the economic catastrophes in Argentina and Uruguay , American bankers fear that the commitment of Latin America to the Washington Consensus , the bundle of free-market policies that has been adopted on the continent since the late 1980s , may be in jeopardy . Given the exposure of U.S. banks and exporters to Latin America , that could translate into lost jobs and profits north of the Rio Grande . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Consensus , John Williamson of the Institute for International Economics in Washington , is a longtime expert on the Brazilian economy . When I spoke with him last week , Williamson sounded a lot more relaxed about the prospect of a Lula government than Wall Street seems to be . After years of failure , says Williamson , the Workers ' Party is now electable precisely because its policies have " converged on the middle ground . " Whatever its program may have been in the past , the party now seems ready to accept the strictures of the IMF and U.S. Treasury , including tight government budgets and a commitment to pay off the debt . Given the economic constraints , a Lula government would be likely to concentrate on those areas that the Workers ' Party has stressed when it has run state and local governments , especially expanding educational opportunities and improving health care .
