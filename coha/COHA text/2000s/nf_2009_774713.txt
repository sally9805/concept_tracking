My Life as a Beautiful Woman // I 've been a beautiful woman for fifty days , and no one has compared me to a summer 's day . No one has said my lips are like rose blossoms or my throat is as smooth as alabaster . // Men do n't have time for that anymore . We live in the age of transparency . Say what you mean and mean what you say . As in : // " You are a very pretty lady . " // " I think you are very attractive . " // " You look hot . " // I 've been approached by more than six hundred men , and that 's one of the big themes I 've discovered in their method : cut to the chase . // The directness has its charms , but like everything else about being a beautiful woman , it has its dark side as well . One suitor tried to seduce me with this line : " I would like to stalk you . " Another said , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side . " Are these guys honest ? Sure . To the point ? Yes . Creepy ? As hell . // I 'm getting ahead of myself . Let me back up . I stumbled into this experiment as a hot woman . This one was n't premeditated . As a general rule , I dislike female impersonation . I have too many bad associations of men in skirts  --  Benny Hill , Uncle Miltie , Idi Amin . But sometimes there are good  --  or at least excusable  --  reasons to pose as a female . // The reason in this case is my two-year-old son 's nanny , Michelle . She 's a stunning woman . Before my wife and I hired her , I thought that hot nannies existed only in vintage Penthouse Forum letters and Aaron Spelling dramas . But Michelle  --  though I 've changed her name for this book  --  is real . She 's twenty-seven and looks like a normal-lipped Angelina Jolie . She 's sweet , funny , has a smile straight out of a cruise-line commercial , and wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how beautiful my nanny is . Among our friends , my wife 's sanity is questioned about twice a week . Michelle is so enchanting , my wife has actually given me permission to have an affair with her , ? la Curb Your Enthusiasm . Of course , she made the offer only because she knew there was no chance Michelle would ever be interested . Michelle is too sweet , too Catholic , too loyal , too young . It 's like giving me permission to become a linebacker for the Dolphins . // In any case , Michelle remains bafflingly single . So my wife and I decided to help her find a boyfriend . How about Internet dating ? we suggested . Michelle balked . She 's shy . She 's not a big fan of e ? ? ? mail . Her Internet 's down . And are n't all the guys on those sites the kind that have a drawerful of ball gags ? // We told her that 's an outdated stereotype . We 'd help her out . Or I would , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up for a dating site , create a profile , sift through her suitors , and cowrite her e ? ? ? mails . I 'd be her online bouncer , bodyguard , censor , and Cyrano . All she 'd have to do is give me some input and allow a few guys to buy her lattes. // She agreed . And even started to like the idea . She wrote her own introductory essay . ( " I want someone who will make me laugh at the littlest thing . " ) We clicked her preferences ( fish and dogs are the best pets ) and uploaded seven smiley , PG ? ? ? rated photos with nothing more risqu ? than an exposed shoulder or two . // At 8 p.m. on a Wednesday , a couple of hours after Michelle had gone home , her profile was approved and popped up online . I 'd been anxious about this . What if it went unnoticed for weeks , gathering dust in an obscure corner of the Internet ? // No need to worry . Her profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute later . The page-view counter shot up to eight , fourteen , twenty . Not quite Huffington Post numbers but brisk traffic . And then the e ? ? ? mails started pinging in . A good dozen before I went to bed . I know that technically these guys are n't e ? ? ? mailing me . Still , it 's an exhilarating feeling to be so desired , if only by proxy . ( And mind you , I did type in the essay and clean up her grammar. ) // : -D // " Hey baby , tell me you 're coming to London , " reads my first e ? ? ? mail , from a British guy who works in advertising . Michelle has given me permission to reject the guys who are clearly wrong . An ocean qualifies as a deal breaker . I zap him back , " Sorry guvnor , no plans to come over there . " I liked my response . Polite and firm  --  but a little flirty . I 'm getting into character . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential . The cute scientist with the Prince Charles ears , the guy from Long Island with eight siblings . We respond : " How are you ? " " How was your week ? " We keep it light , noncommittal  --  and short . That 's an early lesson . I 've always been the chaser , so I did n't realize quite how radically the balance of power shifts when you 're the chasee . Michelle could have responded with a random string of letters and numbers , perhaps an umlaut and a backward slash , and these guys would be encouraged enough to ask her on a date . // After forty-five minutes of boyfriend shopping , Michelle leaves with my son for a trip to the museum . I spend an hour crafting personal rejection notes to yesterday 's discard pile . // Hello sexygentleman , // Thanks for the email . I do n't think we 're quite the right match . But it was nice of you to contact me . Good luck in your search ! // Then I type : // By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexygentleman might turn some women off . Maybe too on the nose . // Perhaps it is n't my place to say so . But , I figured , it is Michelle 's . If a beautiful woman gave me advice  --  solid , well-intentioned advice  --  I 'd pay attention . // Originally , I planned to send a personal ding letter to each of the unsuitable guys . But the volume is overwhelming . By day four , we 've gotten close to fifty approaches . I 'm starting to become shockingly picky . I have a growing list of instant deal breakers : * If the guy uses the word lady or ladies in his opening e ? ? ? mail // * If the guy lists his best feature as " butt " ( ironically or not ) // * If the guy uses more than two exclamation points in one sentence ( One enthusiast wrote : " Hello there beautiful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " ) // * If the guy misspells the first word of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I do n't want to be a spelling snob , but the first word ? // * If the guy 's opening photo features a shot in which his head is tilted more than 20 degrees to the left or right // * If the guy has a photo of his Jet-Ski or snowmobile on his page // * If the guy is wearing sunglasses , any hat besides a baseball cap , or is bare-chested in his main photo // * If the guy refers to female anatomy anywhere in his initial correspondence ( e.g. , " I 'm not a professional gynecologist , but , uh , I 'd be happy to take a look " ) // Never in my life have I had such power . It 's tremendous . Yes , at first I feel guilty about failing to respond to 70 percent of these guys . But it 's just not possible . And in a way , it makes me feel better about my life as a single man . Maybe when my calls to beautiful women went unreturned , it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was just a matter of time management . // ; - ) // I am rooting for one guy . He 's got a warm , unforced smile , and he 's humble , but not falsely humble . " I 'm a geek , but a cool geek because I use a Mac , " he writes . Unfortunately , Michelle rejects him . He 's a drummer and music teacher . Her last boyfriend was a musician . She 's sworn off them . // Michelle and I respond to a lot of the e ? ? ? mails together . But just as often , she tells me to go ahead and reply myself while she 's away . It 's an amazing ego massage , sending e ? ? ? mails as a beautiful woman . It 's so easy . I type one moderately witty thing  --  not even moderately witty  --  and suddenly I 'm Stephen Colbert . I told one guy that Michelle/I hang out at the Museum of Natural History , where there are " more nannies per square inch than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was laughing uncontrollably at work . He said Michelle is " funny , intelligent , caring AND gorgeous . " // It 's not always adulation , though . A few suitors take a snotty tone . One writes that he wants to know more about Michelle but adds , " I can tell from your profile that sometimes you 're a handful . " // That 's annoying . // I respond : " What gives you the idea that I 'm sometimes a handful ? " // He responds : " I am so right ! " // Now the bastard has really pissed me off . I click on his profile . A John Turturro look-alike with a smug smile . His opening photo shows him with his arm around a pretty woman with large breasts , as if to say , " I hang around with hot , large-breasted women , so if you are a hot , large-breasted woman , you should also hang around with me . " He likes to " work hard and play harder . " He is " VERY spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her profile , she says that she 's very open and will let you know when she 's upset . That makes her a handful ? // But I have a theory . I think the son of a bitch is employing an underhanded strategy . I edited an article a couple of years ago about a book called The Game , by Neil Strauss . It 's about a nebbishy guy who decides to become the world 's greatest pickup artist , and it became exceedingly popular with a certain type of single man . One major strategy Strauss talks about is to mildly insult a beautiful woman , lower her self-esteem , thus making her more vulnerable to your advances . // So I e ? ? ? mail Handful Guy as Michelle : " Have you read The Game by Neil Strauss ? " // He says , " What makes you ask me that ? " // Yes ! Busted. // I respond : " I was wondering if your first email was a neg . " A " neg " is pickup patois for the mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was playful teasing . And yes , I have read the book . " // Thus commences a flurry of e ? ? ? mails arguing whether his line qualifies as a neg . Finally , he brings out his trump card : " Considering that I know most of the people in the book personally from before the book was released , I 'm gon na have to disagree . " // Aha . I hit the sleazeball jackpot , a longtime pickup artist . I tell him I 'm glad my womanly radar warned me against him . // He says , " I was hoping online dating would introduce me to different girls than the ones I pick up and seduce in bars , clubs and starbucks . So far not . " // It was the closest thing to an admission of guilt that I was going to get . // I write , " Just remember as you wade through the dating pool his lame metaphor , by the way : we women are not just here to be conquered as part of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone wants down my pants . Michelle probably would have sniffed this guy out eventually , but I 'm proud that I saved her from a date . // : - ( // I was actually prepared for the scammers and the swagger . What I did n't expect was many men 's tragic vulnerability when faced with a dazzling woman . One guy frets that his eyes look weird in his photos because he tried to blacken out the red-eye from the camera . He just wants Michelle to know they are n't that weird in real life . // A martial-arts enthusiast admits flat out that he 's not worthy of Michelle but wants to let her know that " you are gorgeous . " // A forty-one-year-old classical musician writes , " Not being striking in the looks department , I am someone who needs a chance to show his intellect and soul . And I realize how hard that will be when the first impression is made by pictures and written words , but I most sincerely hope you will give me the benefit of the doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a milk shake . Or sign them up for Tony Robbins . Michelle and I send them encouraging notes : " You are a bit out of my age range , so I do n't think it will work out . But I think you 're a nice-looking gentleman . " // Still , it 's rejection , and a lot of men take it hard . " Never will we share a malbec overlooking the Rio at C ? rdoba in Argentina , " writes one Harley-riding architect . " Never will we stand together in Amsterdam looking at Vermeer 's Woman Pouring Milk . Never will I hold your hand . Never will I look into your eyes . Never will you look into mine . " // A bit over-the-top , but I know what he 's saying . I will never hold Michelle 's hand , either , aside from in a game of ring-around-the-rosy. // The power of a beautiful woman 's words is beginning to scare me . One guy begins his introductory essay , " When I was a child , I witnessed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the only time a clown has made me laugh . " // So I write him back on behalf of Michelle : " You 're funny , but too dark for a sweet girl like me . " Both of which are true . // " Just tell me I 'm ugly , " he said . // A few days later , he changed his profile to an essay about his love of Care Bears and snuggling . Yes , it was a joke , but there was an underlying sense of despair . He e ? ? ? mailed Michelle that he really wanted to meet her . He needs a sweet girl . His revamped profile is only for her : " I made it in response to you . " // Men will do anything for you . // ; ) // Michelle has her first off-line date tonight , and I 'm freaking out . It 's with the scientist guy who wears a lot of Patagonia jackets in his photos . I keep staring at my cell phone , jittery as a dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after their scheduled meeting time , Michelle text-messages me from the Starbucks where they were supposed to get together . He never showed up . " That 's it for me and online dating , " she writes . " It really is n't for me. " // She 's surprisingly sensitive . She should have Trump-like self-esteem , but she gets stood up once and she quits the game . // I 'm furious at this Ph.D . bonehead . I spend an hour tracking down his real name on the Internet . ( I know his alma mater and his specialty in marine biology . ) I consider showing up outside his office and asking him why he 's got the emotional maturity of a third grader . Do you know what you 've just blown , you idiot ? Plus , in one of his e ? ? ? mails , the guy said he did n't like pancakes . What kind of asshole does n't like pancakes ? // Then I just get depressed and insecure . What did we say that made him blow us off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been our banter . Did we not talk enough about reef decay in Honduras ? Dammit . My walk on the feminine side is over . My vicarious single life is dead . // The next day , the scientist e ? ? ? mails . He was actually at the Starbucks . He was waiting outside . And Michelle , it turns out , was waiting inside . Come on ! This guy ca n't even find a beautiful woman in a Starbucks the size of your average living room . // But Michelle and I are both relieved . She agrees to try again . I make another plea with her to give the smiley rocker a chance . I had e ? ? ? mailed him that " I had a bad experience with musicians . " He had shot back that he 's " NOT " that guy . He 's been sending us long e ? ? ? mails about his family , his career , and the magnificence of xylophones . He apologizes for the length , but " they just flow out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these guys are too lazy to form a complete thought . A rambling e ? ? ? mail is better than " u a hottie. " // Michelle says she 'll think about it . // : 0 // Today I get the most startling e ? ? ? mail yet . It 's from a guy with the screen name " watchmeontelevision . " Who could it be ? Goran Visnjic ? Al Roker ? // I open it up . " I must confess that I am currently involved with someone but quite frankly am looking for a girl on the side .... // " As you noticed I have no photo to share but I periodically represent my company on national TV . I 'll be on show you 've never heard of on a minor cable network . My name is his full name here . // " I suppose on your path to finding Mr. Right I could perhaps be Mr. Right Now .... " // Oh boy . Did he really use the " Mr. Right Now " line ? And is he actually trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show into sex with a hot mistress ? And why did the subject line say " renaissance woman " ? Is that a new euphemism for slut ? // I know I should have left it there . But I couldn't. // Me : " Intriguing . What 's it like to be on TV ? " // He asks me to watch him and tell him what I think . So I TiVo it . Afterward , I e ? ? ? mail to ask if he was flirting with the host . He responds with a cocky e ? ? ? mail about how the host is n't his type  --  but " you seem like you might be my type . " // I shoot back that I 'm not sure it 's a good idea : " I feel a bit guilty about borrowing another woman 's man . Do you feel guilty ? " // I was hoping to see a hint of remorse , something to humanize him . // He responds : " You know how they say the forbidden fruit is always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him again that I 'm conflicted. // He says meet him this afternoon for a drink , and one of two things will happen : I 'll feel uncomfortable , or I 'll want to meet him later for a nightcap. // I say maybe , but let 's keep e ? ? ? mailing . We chat about travel and our favorite foods . I ask him about the craziest thing he 's ever done . // " Being a business guy who 's ballsy enough to try to be on television , contemplating running for political office "  --  wait , did he just say he was contemplating running for political office ?  --  " moving to ten states for my job , romantic fantasies . ( oh , that one slipped out  --  do you have any fantasies ? ) " // Uh-oh . Here we go . There 's no way I can show this to Michelle . She would be mortified. // I should just drop it , but I do n't . Why ? // To teach this cretin a lesson ? // Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . I can make these miscreants do anything I want . // Revenge ? Against men who give our gender a bad name ? // Whatever it is , it 's something male . I want to take him down . // I respond , " I think food and sex make a nice combo LOL . Some whipped cream . Cherries . Maybe some chocolate syrup. " // I just want to open the door , not get too graphic . // TV guy says , " I like your fantasies involving food and sex .... My fantasies are a bit more risque than that , so maybe I should hold off until you know me better . " // I write , " Send them to me . Nothing can shock me. " // A total setup . // He writes back , " Let 's start with the tamest version of my most common fantasy  --  taking you to a strip club on amateur night ( although there is nothing amateur about your photos ! ) . I 'd like to see you strip for other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a long fur coat and you 're wearing stiletto heels , but underneath the coat I know you 've got on little else ... " // It 's a well-crafted , highly detailed account that stretches a good two pages . // " ... You walk out onstage wearing a lacy black bra from which your breasts are spilling out . You have on a black thong .... You rip off your bra and thong , and your gorgeous , naked body is out there for all to see ... " // It continues with an increasingly graphic description of things she does to the audience . Then he concludes : " ... if you 'd like to continue the fantasy by telling me how you 'd react ... " // Okay . This has gone into unsettling territory . I have to end it . I take the offensive . // " I found your fantasy disturbing on many levels . It made me feel dirty , but not in a good way . I felt like you were exhibiting me to other men like a piece of meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not a prostitute .... I know famous people get away with a lot because of their fame . But I think its best if we end our conversations here . " // I feel momentarily gleeful about punishing this guy . Though more than a bit like a manipulative bastard in my own right . // As it happens , I have been having a simultaneous e ? ? ? mail exchange with another sketchy character . This is a guy who , in his opening e ? ? ? mail , said he was a " BAD boy . " Capitalized . I ask him what makes him bad . He says he 'll do things that would take my breath away . I ask him for details . // He writes " after the nice dinner and the club ... and after turning u on with my nice attitude and sexy thoughts , we will rush to my place where I 'll begin by kissing ur sexy lips ... kissing my way down your stomach ... and then your inner thighs ... detailed description here of the licking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // I write back : " I 'm afraid there 's been a terrible misunderstanding . When I said I wanted details of how you 'd take my breath away , I meant details such as the type of flowers you 'd send me , the candlelit restaurant you 'd take me to , et cetera. " // He responds : " it all started with a dinner and a night at the club . i just did n't give u details about how romantic the dinner was .... no photo ? " // This guy is wonderfully oblivious . As if he 'd only thrown in a description of the tablecloth before the graphic licking it would have been okay . // But that 's it . No more of this nonsense . No more setting guys up and then smacking them down , even if they are cheaters . This is wrong . What am I ? Fourteen ? Or Chris Hansen from Dateline ? I ca n't be wasting my time on this stuff when I have to find Michelle a boyfriend . // I feel guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who had apologized for making me feel dirty . I write that I overreacted but added that I still could n't bring myself to cheat with him . I send it off . Then I noticed I signed the note " A.J. " Damn ! I am dumb . I 'm dumber than an aspiring politician who sends dirty e ? ? ? mail fantasies over the Internet . A week or so later , he e ? ? ? mails Michelle again . He addresses her as " A.J. " and begs her to " come out an play . " I do n't respond . // : - ) // Michelle has another off-line date , and this time I make sure to tell him to meet her inside the bar . It 's the smiley , shaggy-haired rocker . She 's giving him a chance . // In a last-minute panic attack out of Three 's Company , I call Michelle to tell her she should say she went to a Super Bowl party last week . I had e ? ? ? mailed the rocker to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out Michelle got sick and had skipped it in real life . // Again , I wait with my cell phone in hand for the postdate update . // " It was pretty good , " she says . // " Just pretty good ? " // " It was great . He 's very sweet . " // I feel giddy enough to do an actual fist pump . I 'm investing a lot in this guy . He 's my discovery . He 's my stand-in . // I had been worried that Michelle 's online personality would be too different from the way she acts in real life . She 's usually much shyer than the hybrid we 've created . What if he suspects something fishy ? But no , Michelle told me she actually made herself act less shy to conform to her online self . // " When I got there , he said , ' What do you think ? ' And I made him turn around in a circle before I said , ' Not bad . ' " // I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't yet know if the chemistry is there , but the rocker is definitely worth a second date . // I hang up , and my giddiness soon wears off . It 's replaced by sadness . A weird sadness . Almost melancholy , like something out of a Goethe novel . I realize it 's because I 'm vicariously experiencing the feelings of a crush , the excitement , the possibility , both on Michelle 's part and the rocker's. // I 'd forgotten that feeling . And it 's bittersweet , because I know that I ca n't experience that sensation firsthand . I love being married  --  I love its depth and comfort  --  but I miss the crush . Unless you happen to be Mr. watchmeontelevision , you do n't get to feel the rush of the crush . I 'm jealous of the long-haired rocker. // : - // The next day , Michelle pulls up a chair to my computer to go over that day 's haul with me . A whole bunch of e ? ? ? mails . One cheeseball has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-mails from dudes trying to use coy pickup lines . But I do n't care about that . I wan na know if you 're beautiful on the inside . " // I 've gotten more believable e-mails from Nigerian barristers . But he 's right about one thing : she gets lots of dudes complimenting her on her looks . Her pretty eyes , pretty smile , pretty dimples . She 's been called the entire " attractive " entry of the thesaurus : " captivating , " " luminescent , " " radiant . " // " How many of them do you think read the profile ? " Michelle asks me . I laugh and turn to look at her . She keeps her eyes on the screen . // We click on a thirty-four-year-old who describes his job as international investigator for a corporation  --  whatever that means . Michelle looks at his photo . // " If we have kids , they 'll have huge chins , " she says . // " Why ? " // " Because I have a big chin , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not big . It 's not even half the size of Reese Witherspoon 's . Now , I 'm sure Redbook has run a thousand articles about how even Gisele has insecurities about her body . But beautiful women do n't confess it to men so much . Maybe Michelle is starting to see me as a fellow woman . Disturbing . // The chin issue notwithstanding , a couple of days later Michelle goes on a date with the international investigator . I get the cell phone call . // " How 'd it go ? " // " It was just okay . " // That 's Michelle 's equivalent of " disastrous . " A date with Muqtada al ? ? ? Sadr would be " just okay . " // " What happened ? " // " I was really self-conscious , " she says . " He stared at me the whole time . I could n't even look him in the eyes . " // The next night , a second date with the rocker , at a Thai restaurant . I wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes after the date . // " He 's nice , but there 's no chemistry , I think . " // I 'm crushed . I thought there was a chance . I can help her write the notes , I can pick the guys , but I ca n't control that damn chemistry . // Maybe she 'll find some chemistry with Ted from Long Island , the one with eight siblings . He 's scheduled for next week . And so is " Loveable Hal . " // I know she 'll find it with someone . Not just because the e ? ? ? mails from interested men keep flooding in , unabated . But because of the men themselves . The only thing more surprising than the quantity and deviousness of the creeps is the emotional honesty and fragility of the noncreeps . It 's a side of men that other men just do n't get to see . // It 's enough to bring out the nurturer in anybody . Which is why I log on to the dating service and do a search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I find this : ummmm , I just turned 28 . Sorry to say I still live at home with my mother . Shes getting old and I help her out . I have NO LIFE . Go to work and come home , and play video games . // The next day , Michelle and I write him a note : " I just wanted to say that I think it 's great that you take care of your mom . There are n't enough nice guys in this world . I do n't think we 're right for each other ( I do n't believe in long-distance relationships ) , but I think you 'll be a catch for some lucky girl . " // Well , it 's something . To paraphrase another guy with a double identity , with great beauty comes great responsibility . // CODA // A few weeks later , Michelle dumped me . She let me down easy  --  " I think maybe I need a break from Internet dating , " she said . But I knew what that meant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Cyrano . // I tried to convince her to give it another shot . But when we logged on and saw a note from screen name " Violentbunny , " that was it . She was finished for good . ( Violentbunny : you , sexygentleman , and Topnotchlover need to have a good brainstorming session. ) // Michelle said she 'd just wait and hope that love came to her . Which I thought was a terrible idea . But it actually did . Six months later , she started dating an old friend she knew from when she worked at a Washington , D.C. , hotel . They 're still together . // I wish I 'd been the one to find her love . But Michelle told me that I helped . I got her back into the dating mind-set , back tothinking about relationships . Without her great Internet Dating Adventure , she says , she 'd still be single and lonely . I hope she 's telling the truth . // Regardless , my dating career is over for now . I 've got mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nonstop positive attention comes to mind . But it was also an emotionally draining experience . The amount of rejecting I had to do was mind-boggling . Every day it was " no , no , nope , no thanks , no . " And not just to the sleazy guys . Sometimes to kind , vulnerable men . Type the wrong thing and you 'll send these fellows into a tailspin . I never before thought of the built-in guilt that comes with having a pretty face . // It was draining , too , trying to suss out the schemers . There were a huge number of people out there pretending to be what they are n't . Including me , of course . ( Incidentally , a colleague of mine goes into Internet poker rooms and pretends to be a woman , because he says his opponents assume women are worse at poker . I ca n't decide whether taking advantage of sexist stereotypes is ethically acceptable . ) There 's a lot of deceit , boasting , and creepiness that you 'll find in Internet dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an honesty amplifier . Men will open themselves right up , laying bare their fears , insecurities , and hopes . My months of e ? ? ? dating convinced me there are plenty of mensches out there . Or maybe they 're just sleazy guys who had their sensitive sisters write notes for them .
