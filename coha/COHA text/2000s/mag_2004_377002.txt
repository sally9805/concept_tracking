CRAIG FERGUSON , best known to American audiences as The Drew Carey Show 's insufferable boss Mr. Wick , takes the reins of CBS 's Late Late Show in January , which another Craig  --  Kilborn in this case  --  dropped over the summer . ( Easier to remember the name of the guy behind the desk , that way . ) Ferguson won a bake-off with three other funny guys , much to his surprise . " I thought , There 's no way they 're going to let a Scottish guy do this show , " he says . ( Has he never seen Shrek ? ) We eagerly await seeing all those guests in kilts .
