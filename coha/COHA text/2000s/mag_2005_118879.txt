Modesty and Floyd Mayweather Jr . do not belong in the same sentence , no more so than Arturo ( Thunder ) Gatti and Mayweather belonged in the same ring last Saturday night in Atlantic City . Many people ( Mayweather included ) believe he 's the world 's best pound-for-pound prizefighter . Many people ( Mayweather included ) find him a vain , boastful loudmouth . At last week 's weigh-in for his title bout with the WBC super lightweight , the 28-year-old egomaniac said of the 33-year-old champ , " It 's time that he faced the truth -- and I 'm the truth . I have n't ducked any opponents and have no weaknesses . A lot can match my speed . A lot can match my power . But no one can match me mentally . " // Well , as Reggie Jackson once said , it ai n't braggin ' if you can back it up . And on Saturday the unbeaten Mayweather ( 34 -- 0 , with 23 knockouts ) not only backed it up but also backed up Gatti . Stabbing sharp lefts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he battered him helpless for six rounds . With Gatti 's left eye closed to a slit , his corner stopped the match before the start of the seventh . Pretty Boy Floyd had made easy work of boxing 's foremost **26;178;TOOLONG the puncher by more than four to one -- to win his third world title in as many weight classes . // Mayweather makes boxing seem like a ballet of feet and fists in magical coordination . Those nimble extremities have kept the face of the Grand Rapids native unmarked . Still , his brilliance has hardly endeared him to fight fans , who prefer electrifying KO 's to flashy D. Until he faced Gatti , Mayweather had never even fought in a pay-per-view event . " It 's not cool to take shots to the head and bleed , " he said last Thursday . " The less you get hit , the longer you last . I 'm not in this sport to see how hard I can get hit or to see how many big punches I can take . " // Gatti may be . Though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his popularity is rooted in courageous comebacks and an ability to dispense and withstand punishment . " I 'm ready to die in that ring , " Gatti said before the bout . " That 's the difference between me and Mayweather. " // Mayweather did n't think that was the most telling difference between them . During a prefight luncheon he compared the heavy underdog to a heavy bag , dismissed him as little more than a club fighter and , mocking Gatti 's struggle to make weight , piled food on a plate . " None of that stuff bothers me , " Gatti said . " I 'm from Jersey . " // Twenty of his bouts have been in Atlantic City , including the last six -- all sellouts , as Gatti has become a sort of municipal attraction , like the Boardwalk or the Miss America pageant . He entered a packed arena on Saturday to the crackle of fireworks , but he did n't last long . // Thinking he had been fouled late in the opening round , Gatti dropped his hands and looked over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chin with a left hook . Gatti slumped to the second rope and took a standing eight count . " The ref said protect yourself at all times , " Gatti said later . " I guess I learned the hard way . " // Gatti never regained his focus . For the rest of the fight Mayweather shot in punch after punch . By the end of Round 6 both of Gatti 's eyes had puffed up like buttermilk biscuits . " It 's great to have heart , " said Mayweather , " but heart can get your ass tore up . " // ? To see a photo gallery of the Mayweather-Gatti bout go to SI.com/floyd
