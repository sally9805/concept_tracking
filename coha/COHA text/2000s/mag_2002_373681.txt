What to do about Saddam Hussein ? scenario no. 1 : we pre-emptively invade Iraq ( as administration hawks suggest ) , alienate all our allies , radicalize the entire Middle East , hopelessly complicate the fight against al-Qaeda and render ourselves international pariahs . <P> It 's Kim Jong Il from North Korea . He 's calling to say he feels your pain . <P> Ha ha , Colin . Very funny . You 've made your point . <P> Is there an alternative more consistent with our national ideals ? scenario no. 2 : first , we actually make friends with Saddam . ( but only for pretend . ) <P> Now that we have bonded , I can tell you the truth : I would never have invaded Kuwait if I had realized what a big hard-ass your father is . <P> Like I do n't know . Try totaling your Mustang at Yale sometime . <P> Next , we shower the iraqis with foreign aid so they can rebuild their economy by hiring only the most qualified American companies . <P> Nothing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are then asked to buy lots of cheap Iraqi oil and drive suvs hundreds of miles a day . ( this is the best part of the plan since it 's precisely the kind of sacrifice Americans are willing to make . ) <P> Do n't forget to top it off , Jimmy ! <P> And do n't YOU forget that you ca n't spell " very fuel efficient " without E , V , I and L ! <P> Finally we spring our trap : global warming gets much worse , the polar ice caps melt and Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction are rendered inoperable due to water damage . <P> I 'm afraid our entire stockpile of enriched uranium has mildewed . <P> ARGGH ! It 's those damn Bushes again ! <P> As with any plan , of course , there are still a few bugs to be worked out . <P> What do you think , Mr. President ? <P> Well , I like the parts about SUVs and mildew . But I feel like it 's missing , I du n no  --  maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean , DUH !
