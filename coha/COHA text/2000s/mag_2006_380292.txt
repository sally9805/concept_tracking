Mel Rapton does n't know how to pronounce the name of the Chinese company whose automobiles he would like to import and perhaps sell at his Honda dealership in Sacramento , Calif . He does n't know what styles he 'll promote , what he 'll charge or how exactly he 'll persuade Americans to buy a car made in China-one that is n't a Hot Wheels toy , that is . <P> Rapton does know that when he took a tour of the Hebei Zhongxing Automobile factory south of Beijing last November , he watched workers weld vehicle components together by hand-an assembly scene out of the ' 50s . But after his son test-drove a few models , Rapton started to think he could sell China 's cars in the U.S. Setting aside doubts about Hebei 's quality control , he signed a " memo of understanding " to negotiate an import deal . " It might take them a year or two to get started , " he says , " but I 'm willing to take my chances . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
