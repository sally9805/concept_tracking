Welcome to midwinter . Long nights punctuated by short days-and brutal cold in some parts of the country . Smart animals hibernate . Perhaps you feel like hibernating , too . But do n't run off with the ground squirrels and terrapins : A constant feeling of exhaustion is n't seasonal in humans . It may be MS fatigue-or a sign that you are n't getting quality sleep . MS fatigue or poor sleep ? It 's hard to tell the difference . They feel similar and they can be interrelated . But there are signs to look for . If you 're getting up day after day feeling unrested-even before using the bathroom or taking a shower-that could be a sign that you are n't getting enough sleep , or that your sleep quality is being disturbed .

Muscle problems These include parasomnias , or abnormal movements or behavior during sleep . * REM disorder ( talking or walking in your sleep ) . * Restless leg syndrome ( an irresistible urge to move your leg ) . * Involuntary kicking or twitching , known as periodic limb movements in sleep , or PEMS . PEMS often involves bending at the hips or knees , which can awaken you with a start . But some PEMS are tiny . Your foot or toe involuntarily pulls up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 seconds over the course of a half hour or so . The movement may not wake you , but it can keep you from deep sleep . Nocturia Having to go the bathroom frequently during the night-called nocturia-has many causes , some of them surprising .

But decreased mobility during the day can cause fluid retention . // <p>
