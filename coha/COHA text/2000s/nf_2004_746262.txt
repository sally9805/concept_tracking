Key words : Kenworthy 's theories ; tips for social studies teachers ; ideas for teaching social studies <p> Leonard Stout Kenworthy was born to Quaker parents in Richmond , Indiana , in 1912 . His father , Murray Kenworthy , was a faculty member in the religious studies department at Earlham College in Richmond . After spending time in New York , Ohio , and Washington , DC , Kenworthy enrolled in a Quaker boarding school not far from Philadelphia . After graduation , he attended Earlham College . In 1933 , Kenworthy enrolled at Columbia University in New York and received a master 's degree in U.S. history . For several years , he was a faculty member at the Friends Select School in Philadelphia , the Brunswick School in Greenwich , Connecticut , and the Friends Central School in Overbrook , Pennsylvania . <p> Kenworthy , his father , and his brother spent many years working in other countries for humanitarian causes . His father led relief work in the Soviet Union during the blight of the Volga region in 1922 , and his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far East on the staff of the English-based newspaper in Tokyo . In 1940 , when the American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia asked Leonard to direct a relief agency in Berlin for the aid of Jewish people who wanted to emigrate from Germany , he accepted the position . <p> After Kenworthy ended his yearlong stay in Berlin , he returned to the United States , where , before long , he was drafted . As a conscientious objector , he spent the next few years in the Civilian Public Service , a Friends program for pacifists . In the Civilian Public Service , Kenworthy worked with emotionally disturbed children for a year and then volunteered in medical experiments at Yale University . <p> At the end of the war , Kenworthy took a position with the United Nations Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) in Europe . He was the first head of its Division on Education for International Understanding and wrote the first book commissioned by UNESCO . After his work at UNESCO , he taught social studies methods and international education for thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City University of New York . He died in 1991 . He was active on the international relations committees of the National Education Association , the Association for Curriculum , and the National Council for the Social Studies ( Kenworthy 1977 ) . He also wrote scores of books and articles on education issues , the teaching of social studies , events in world affairs , and Quaker practices . Unfortunately , others have written little about him ( Beardsley 1993 , 159 ) . <p> Among his many books , his Guide to Social Studies Teaching in Secondary Schools ( 1973 ) is a particularly rich source of interesting ideas and activities for teaching social studies . Although no longer in print , it is still in most libraries at the collegiate level and remains a useful and popular reference among preservice and inservice teachers . Of particular interest are the lesson starters and extensions . He frames his suggestions and beliefs about good teaching within the larger context of aims : the behavior to be affected , the attitudes to be changed , the skills to be developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 225-26 ) . Aims of the Social Studies <p> Kenworthy states that if the guiding purpose of teaching social studies is to encourage social and civic participation , then the focus in teaching should center on behavioral aims . He notes that for their entire lives , individuals choose leaders , whether in social situations or in political arenas . Therefore , the social studies should have as one of its guiding principles the study of the qualities needed for different leadership positions . The school and the community should be places in which the outcomes of those efforts are applied . <p> In a similar manner , students will participate as members of informal groups , as individuals in a family , in the workplace , in labor organizations , in business associations , and in social situations . To prepare students for these aspects of everyday living , it is imperative that teachers provide students with opportunities in which they take part in the skills of cooperative living . In addition , students will need to act as people of moral character , good judgment , and clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , to form basic beliefs about life that will be important to social and civic improvement , to focus on their strengths , and to understand their weaknesses as individuals . <p> Kenworthy believed that those purposes should always be in the forefront of social studies teachers ' thinking and should be viewed as necessary aspects in teaching , rather than as aims in competition with content . He tied to the behavioral aims the numerous attitudinal purposes to be addressed in social studies classes , ranging from courtesy and consideration for people of diverse backgrounds to respect for legal authority when democratically determined . <p> An attitude on which individuals are usually in consensus is the need for respect of people of various religious persuasions . Kenworthy wrote that it is imperative for teachers to encourage understanding and respect for all people . He also believed that teachers need always to be on guard to thwart the idea that all individuals involved in politics are inherently corrupt , although he acknowledged that some dishonest people may be in public service . Kenworthy maintained that the teacher had opportunities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were written into the lesson or whether the teacher was conscious of them . At every opportunity , the aims should be the focus of the lessons . <p> Kenworthy identified fostering skills as a separate goal . He stated that many skills need to be emphasized in the social studies , ranging from understanding map symbols to leading a panel . For their entire life , individuals use maps , whether flight maps or road maps , maps from an architect or a geologist , or maps of a neighborhood or a city . The maps may be polar projection maps or Mercator projection maps . Teachers need to familiarize students with the specifics of maps and give them the time needed to acquire the skills for understanding and successfully using maps . <p> Throughout their lives , people must think critically and make choices , whether at the store or in the voting booth for a local tax levy . They have to judge the credibility of their sources of information and make decisions on candidates at election time . They must assess the merits of an issue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the newspaper . They must take a stand on issues in their social groups and their professional lives . Kenworthy believed that all lessons in the social studies classroom include certain skills that are either central to the day 's lesson or are an implied outcome , making skill development an important part of good social studies teaching . <p> The final category in social studies aims is the learning of knowledge . Kenworthy believed that the knowledge to be emphasized ought to be selected on the basis of the behavior to be affected , the attitudes to be changed , and the skills to be developed . For example , when a teacher plans to spend two days on the contributions of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the impact of the New Deal , the teacher 's task is to choose from the accumulation of major points about Roosevelt and the New Deal and to present them to the students . Any number of points can be made , and hundreds of sources can be consulted . If the students have negative views about the New Deal , the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported Roosevelt so that students acquire a deeper appreciation of the effect of the New Deal . If the students believe that any political activity is suspect and that individuals enter politics only for personal gain , the teacher needs to point out that Roosevelt was an aristocrat and yet related easily to the poor . If the students believe that Roosevelt was universally supported , they need to learn about the backlash , even from a number of his most impassioned supporters , when he attempted to change the composition of the Supreme Court . According to Kenworthy , these points need to be brought out in any discussion of the New Deal and Roosevelt , but he believed that the ideas emphasized do change or should change with the makeup of the students in class , which must be intelligently and unselfishly recognized by the teacher . Kenworthy offered many strategies through which the teacher can affect behavior , change attitudes , develop skills , and teach content ( Kenworthy 1973 , 231-33 , 252-58 ) . Starting a Lesson <p> Kenworthy noted that teachers , especially new teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that acceptable because it indicates that they are interested in teaching well , yet worrisome because it suggests that they believe that a powerful beginning means that the rest of the lesson will go smoothly . In their concern to get a lesson off to a good start , teachers often turn to a gimmick and then stop the effort . With purposeful motivation , a teacher endeavors to inspire students throughout a lesson . <p> Students can be motivated to learn when they are relaxed yet ready to learn ; when they choose or help choose issues and objectives of a lesson whose topic interests them ; when they can learn through real-life experiences ; when they are asked to do things within their capabilities ; when they are aware with their hearts as well as with their heads ; when a new idea is connected to an old idea ; when they have pondered the implications of their actions and engaged in an assessment of them ; when their learning leads to a social consequence related to it ; when a concept is made clear through repetition ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when there is an element of newness or surprise . In its other sense , motivation is the means that the teacher uses to start a lesson . <p> Starting with Material Things <p> When the teacher 's friend brings a five-Reich mark German stamp from the 1920s surcharged at five thousand Reich marks to class , the teacher invites several students to look at the stamp and explain their observation . To answer questions about the reasons for the surcharge , the students do research about the causes and consequences of inflation . <p> The teacher and the students assemble a variety of personal and household items on a table in the classroom . The items include gold jewelry , silver flatware , copper wiring , steel wool , lead piping , nickel plating , zinc tubing , and aluminum siding . They place the items on a table and discuss them , focusing on their uses and origins . Then they place each item at the base of the chalkboard and string colored yarn from each object to the places on a map where the raw material is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the start of the lesson , the teacher announces that Franklin D. Roosevelt was one of the most loved as well as most despised figures in U.S. history . For the remainder of the period , the teacher and the students examine why that assertion is true . On another day , the teacher begins with the statement , " Imperialism is dead , but it has n't been buried yet . " Then the students respond to the statement and give examples of its validity . Teachers can write such statements on the board so that students may refer back to them throughout the discussion period . <p> Opening with Maps and Globes <p> For a unit on South America , the teacher can refer the students to a map and begin the lesson by having them describe what they see of interest on the map or by asking where they would like to live , work , or play and explain why . Showing the class a polar projection with Russia and the former Soviet Union in the center catches most students ' attention . After the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian classrooms for social studies or history classes , he or she can lead into a discussion of how students in Russia view other countries and begin a lesson on the relationship between a nation 's political life and its geography . <p> Starting with a Role Play <p> When starting a lesson about the Supreme Court , the teacher explains the plan to serve on the mock court and then asks the following questions before assembling the group for a role play : <p> How many volunteers will be needed ? <p> What are the necessary job qualifications ? <p> Who nominates the judges ? <p> Who confirms them ? <p> What are the responsibilities of the justices on the court ? <p> If some students do not participate , the teacher can ask them why they do not want to be justices of the Supreme Court or why they do not believe they are qualified . The teacher can also use the role-play method to have the students assume the roles of famous Supreme Court judges or of great inventors of the past or present and make presentations about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the cotton gin . They can explain the impact associated with their inventions now or in the past . For this technique to work well , the teacher should assign students to learn about one of the inventors in advance of the role-playing . Throughout the lesson , students remain in their roles . <p> Involving Students in Problem Solving <p> At the start of the period , the teacher explains the problem . For example , the teacher announces that the state is in serious financial trouble , so the students are to research ways to improve its economic outlook . The important questions are : What do you do in the short and long terms ? and Why ? In another class , the teacher asks the students to identify ten people from Greece for a Greek Hall of Heroes . For the remainder of the period , the students can do research to support their choices . <p> Beginning a Class with a Tape Recording or Music <p> A recording of a famous speech or a stirring piece of music can catch students ' attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ben-Gurion 's speech when Israel became a sovereign nation and then discuss the meaning of his words , their context , and the eventual conflict that arose . If a student in class plays a guitar or some other instrument for the folk music , the teacher can arrange for that student to accompany the class as they sing a folk song . Should the song be " The Erie Canal , " the teacher continues the class with a discussion of why the canal was built , what it cost to construct the canal , where it was located , and what its impact was on the American people at the time . <p> Beginning with a Chalkboard Presentation <p> Students arrive in the classroom and find an equilateral triangle drawn on the board . The teacher begins class by telling the class that the triangle symbolizes the social hierarchy of French society at the beginning of the French Revolution . The students complete the chart , with the peasants at the base , the nobility in the middle , and the king at the top . Through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Revolution had the effect of turning the visual upside-down . As a follow-up , the class can discuss whether the French Revolution actually had that effect . <p> Beginning a Class with Controversial Statements <p> Certain statements can serve as openers to a lively class discussion . The students receive the statements in one class and prepare to discuss them in the following class . Statements such as the following can spur students to a lively discussion : <p> The Crusades were the most successful failure in history . <p> A single bullet has cheated history . <p> The future of Italy is in the past . <p> The League of Nations was not a failure of machinery but of men . <p> Those who use the tactics of the enemy become the enemy themselves . <p> Franklin Roosevelt salvaged capitalism rather than destroying it . <p> There is no Asia . <p> Latin Americans are prisoners of their geography . <p> Kenworthy also reminds his readers that not all lessons need a powerful beginning . His aim is to motivate teachers to turn an ordinary lesson into an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long career , Kenworthy taught thousands of lessons in secondary schools , supervised hundreds of lessons taught by inexperienced teachers , and participated in lessons taught by veteran teachers . He judged several lessons to be particularly interesting and the type that would be appreciated by students . He recognized that one can not reproduce exactly the lesson of another teacher but can adapt ideas from the lessons to fit the situation and teaching preferences . Kenworthy hoped that describing noteworthy lessons such as the following would inspire teachers to make better lesson plans . <p> The Northwest Ordinance ( Eighth-Grade U.S. History Class ) <p> For students reading about the Ordinances of 1784 and 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 , it is difficult to understand the terms because the Northwest of today is not the Northwest of old and because space relationships are the same . The teacher in this report began the lesson by putting construction paper over the area of the Northwest of old on a U.S. map . The paper corresponded to the map that the teacher was using . The action immediately caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by the ordinance . As the lesson continued , boundaries were added to the paper to show the states that had once been territories . <p> Propaganda ( Ninth-Grade Civics Class ) <p> Halfway through a lesson , the teacher asked the students if any statements made in the past twenty minutes were examples of propaganda . The students looked at one another for a moment , then began to consider the possibility . The teacher waited until the students mentioned the uses of propaganda . Instead of lecturing about the topic , the teacher gave the students the opportunity to do some careful thinking about the practices of deception that were being discussed . <p> Installment Buying ( Twelfth-Grade Economics Class ) <p> A group of students not especially interested in social studies came to a better appreciation of the subject one day when a young teacher entered the room carrying a large box . The teacher explained that he had a compact disc player in it , which he would be willing to sell to anyone who had enough money . Several students said that they wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The teacher then took on the role of a salesperson , explaining that a student could get the player for a small amount down and a dollar a week . Several students were interested , and the teacher asked one to come to the front where the teacher tried to get her to agree to a contract . Before long , the other students were telling her not to be swayed by his manner . After the role playing , the teacher discussed the positive side of installment buying and then the negative side , listing the advantages and disadvantages on the board . <p> The Life of Napoleon ( Tenth-Grade World History Class ) <p> When an interested group of students was about to study the triumphs and tragedies of Napoleon and his influence on world affairs , the teacher gave out copies of two statements about Napoleon . One glorified him to the end ; the other vilified him as one of the criminals of history . For the next several days , the students ' task was to collect information supporting each statement . The students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in class . In a formal discussion on the last day , the students presented their research in support of the two statements , citing sources for their opinion . The students had gained knowledge in the context of critical thinking . <p> Discovering the Mediterranean Countries ( Seventh-Grade World Geography Class ) <p> After three days of reading about Mediterranean countries , a teacher came to class with a set of thirty pictures with the captions removed . Once the students received the pictures , they discussed the pictures and the country . Most of the students were convinced that the photographs were scenes from Spain , but there were several pictures that a few students thought could have come from that part of the Mediterranean . The assignment for the following day was to determine whether any of the pictures could be photographs of Spain . <p> The Accomplishments of John F. Kennedy ( Eleventh-Grade U.S. History Class ) <p> Before class , the teacher drew a stone monument on the board with John F. Kennedy 's name and dates of birth and death . The arriving students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Thomas Jefferson 's stone included the inscription , " Here was buried Thomas Jefferson , author of the Declaration of Independence , of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom , and Father of the University of Virginia , " an inscription that Jefferson directed be placed on his stone . The teacher then asked the students to decide three accomplishments that might be placed on Kennedy 's marker . After a spirited debate , the students reached little consensus on the accomplishments that best reflect his place in history . <p> The Versailles Treaty ( Eleventh-Grade U.S. History Class ) <p> Students conducted research on a head of state who attended the Versailles Conference after World War I , gathering information about the person , his philosophy , and his impact on the outcome of the meeting . At the start of the class , four students were selected for the roles of Orlando , Lloyd George , Clemenceau , and Wilson . Others were chosen to be journalists to question the individuals about their views . The question-and-answer session lasted through the period , and on the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review . <p> The United Nations ( Seventh-Grade World History Class ) <p> To teach about the organization of the United Nations and its administrative agencies , a teacher set up a display with circles of different colors denoting the major divisions of the United Nations and rectangles denoting the other agencies . Over a few days , the circles and rectangles were added to the display as study focused on the major divisions and agencies . By the end of the week , all UN divisions and agencies received attention , and the class could discuss the function of the United Nations . <p> Health in the United States ( Eighth-or Eleventh-Grade U.S. History Class ) <p> The teacher began the lesson with a bar graph to show life expectancy in the United States in 1800 ( age forty-five ) , in 1850 ( age thirty-nine ) , in 1900 ( age forty-seven ) , in 1970 ( age seventy ) , and in 2002 ( age seventy-eight ) . Next , the teacher asked the students to explain why the change in life expectancy was occurring , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Classroom Archaeology ( Ninth-Grade Ancient History Class ) <p> The teacher gave students a handout about archaeologists finding artifacts on an expedition to an area of the country where it was assumed people lived centuries ago . Among the artifacts were the bones and tusks of an elephant , hand-sculptured stone figurines , pieces of earthenware , ashes and charcoal , stone arrowheads , seeds of grain , fragments of flint , a person 's skeleton , and stone implements and instruments , a flint axe , and the skeletons of a dog and a cat . The teacher told the students to work alone for part of the period , organizing the artifacts into strata as they thought they would have been found in an excavation of the area . When they finished , the students explained how they organized the items according to geologic time . From the questions raised , the students conducted research to explain the location of the artifacts . <p> Japanese Design and Decoration ( Tenth-Grade World History Class ) <p> While reading about Japan , the teacher invited the Japanese spouse of an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese design and decoration . Although she was not fluent in English , she was able to gesture effectively to communicate with the class . The children had their first lesson in the culture of another people . <p> Poverty in the United States ( Twelfth-Grade Contemporary Issues Class ) <p> Several students in an advanced placement class on problems in American democracy developed a television documentary for their class , along with charts , graphs , maps , and other visuals to show the points they wanted to make about an American problem . One student in the group was assigned to each segment of the program , which included the following topics : What is meant by poverty ? Why should we be concerned about poverty in the United States ? Where are the concentrations of poverty ? Appalachia , a case in point , and an introduction to poverty programs were also addressed . For information , the students used books and articles from newspapers and magazines . At the end of the documentary , the class discussed the problem of poverty and its solutions . <p> Music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Late in the school year , when students are restless as the days of summer vacation near , a teacher was starting a review of course content and decided to review the significant periods of American history through the use of music . With the help of students , he planned a four-day program of entertainment and education . They assembled sheet music and recordings . Several students and parents were invited to perform . <p> Beginning with the early colonial piece " Old One Hundred , " the students sang , listened to recordings , and watched their fellow students and guests play and sing songs about the railroads and the sea . They sang Negro religious songs , work songs , and the Depression song " Brother , Can You Spare A Dime ? " The teacher asked the students to identify ways in which the songs helped them better appreciate history . The program helped maintain the students ' involvement , made them take a second look at their heritage , and demonstrated the parallels between music and history . <p> Products of Africa ( Ninth-Grade World Geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a vague idea to students with learning disabilities , he planned to make the products of that continent real . He brought to school a chocolate bar , a bar of soap , a lemon , an orange , a gold ring , a piece of copper , a sheet of aluminum , and a photograph of a nuclear bomb . As he removed each item , he talked to the students about the farming of cacao , palm oil , and citrus fruits and the mining of copper , bauxite , and uranium . He then placed the items on an outline map of Africa made of tagboard and placed it in one corner of the room . The students ' research assignment was to discover what other products were farmed , mined , or produced in Africa and to find visuals to put on the map by the end of the week . <p> The United States as a New Nation ( Twelfth-Grade World Cultures Class ) <p> For several weeks , the students had been focusing on the nation-states that emerged after World War II . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a start to individual and group study of several countries . To establish that the United States also had problems of a similar nature when it became an independent nation , the students were to determine the number and kinds of problems faced by the first administration when it came into power in 1789 . <p> When the study was finished , the students had identified the absence of a system of political parties , the lack of a common language , the friction between France and England in which the United States remained involved , the inability of many people to read or write , transportation and communication problems , the Alien and Sedition Acts , the Whiskey Rebellion , and the selection of a military officer to lead the new nation . <p> As a result of their research , American independence took on a new importance to the students , and they had a better appreciation of the problems of emerging nations . <p> World Religions ( Tenth-Grade World History Class ) <p> A new teacher of a remedial group was having concerns about teaching the similarities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she decided to make a large drawing to take to class . She titled it " The Tree of Western Religions . " The foot of the tree was labeled Judaism and Greek Philosophies . A heavy branch near the base was labeled Christianity . Above it , to one side , she put another branch labeled Islam . She could have continued in this manner for some time , but for this class she kept the ideas simple . In another world history class focusing on a study of Asia , a second teacher sketched a picture of Asian religions , with trees used to show the dominant religions of that part of the Pacific Rim . Conclusion <p> I believe that the ideas presented here are helpful because they reflect the behavioral , attitudinal , skill , and knowledge aims of good social studies teaching in any time period , whether Kenworthy 's time or the present day . As Kenworthy put it , if the major purpose of social studies teaching is to encourage social and civic participation , then the focus in teaching should be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social studies teachers and should be a critical part of teaching . <p> Many attitudinal goals also need to be considered in social studies classes . The broad aim of developing skills overlaps with behavioral and attitudinal purposes . Every lesson in the social studies reflects some emphasis on skills , making skill development critical in good social studies teaching . The final aims are the acquisition of knowledge , which should be selected on the basis of the behavior to be affected , the attitudes to be changed , and the skills to be developed . The ideas and activities presented here can help teachers achieve those aims . <p>
