It was a year of impossible dreams fulfilled and operatic passions played out , of fantastic athletic achievement stunning for what it was and stunning for what it meant . When Ben Hogan won three of golf 's four major tournaments in 1953 , some said it would never be done again . Had you wagered that the next player to do it would be a young American of eclectically mixed race  --  a bit of white , a bit of black , a lot of Asian  --  then you would have walked off the course with cash worth counting . <P> In tennis Pete Sampras set a new record for most majors  --  13  --  when he won again at Wimbledon . But for all his heroics Pete could not seize the spotlight from the dynamic , effervescent Venus Williams of Compton , Calif. , who became the first black player to win the All England title since Arthur Ashe did it in 1975 . She then added the U.S. Open crown and a couple of Olympic gold medals to complete a career year  --  at age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her kid sister Serena as they danced to the doubles crown , but it meant brutal pressure for a woman named Cathy Freeman , who opened the Games by ceremonially lighting the cauldron and then , with the weight of her country upon her , came through sensationally in her footrace to become the first Aboriginal Australian ever to win an individual gold medal . <P> If the Olympics for once really did speak to larger issues of fairness and fellowship , baseball 's World Series pitted brother against brother in a vintage New York City gang war . The image that lingers is not of a titanic home run or a dazzling play at shortstop , but of a large , fearsome pitcher preparing to throw a jagged piece of lumber toward a large , fearsome catcher . In the year 2000 , the best of sports was about much more than sports .  --  Robert Sullivan <P> The Golden Girl <P> Marion Jones left Sydney with three gold medals ( for the 100-m sprint , the 200 m and the 4 x 400-m relay ) , two bronzes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relay ) and a massive headache , having faced a storm of questions about her husband , injured shot-putter C.J. Hunter , whose positive tests for steroid use were revealed during the Games . Of Jones ' ups and downs , the one to remember was the first . In the 100 m she blazed to a time of 10.75 secs . and the largest margin of victory in that race since the 1952 Games . <P> The Gaudy Guy <P> " I want Maurice Greene to put on the best performance ever seen . " So said Maurice Greene before the male version of the 100 m . While not quite equal to his wish , the world-record holder ran a dramatic race , coming from third to catch the leaders at 60 m and then to pull away . The world 's fastest man , usually brazen , cried openly during the medal ceremony . <P> For Her People
