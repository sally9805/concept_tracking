1 The freshly paved road left Santa Fe and arrowed west through pion trees . An amber-colored sun was sinking into a scrim of dirty clouds behind the snowcapped Jemez Mountains , drawing a counterpane of shade across the landscape . Nora Kelly guided the rattletrap Ford pickup along the road , down chamisa-covered hills and across the beds of dry washes . It was the third time she had been out here in as many months . As she came up from Buckman 's Wash into Jackrabbit Flats-what had once been Jackrabbit Flats-she saw a shining arc of light beyond the pions . A moment later , her truck was speeding past manicured greens . A nearby sprinkler head winked and nodded in the sun , jetting water in a regular , palsied cadence . Beyond , on a rise , stood the new Fox Run clubhouse , a massive structure of fake adobe . Nora looked away . The truck rattled over a cattle guard at the far end of Fox Run and suddenly , the road was washboard dirt . She bounced past a cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read RANCHO DE LAS CABRILLAS . For a moment , the memory of a summer day twenty years before passed through her mind : once again she was standing in the heat , holding a bucket , helping her father paint the sign . Cabrillas , he 'd said , was the Spanish word for waterbugs . But it was also their name for the constellation Pleiades , which he said looked like water skaters on the shining surface of a pond . " To hell with the cattle , " she remembered him saying , swabbing thick letters with the paintbrush . " I bought this place for its stars . " The road turned to ascend a rise , and she slowed . The sun had now disappeared , and the light was draining fast out of the high desert sky . There in a grassy valley stood the old ranch house , windows boarded up . And beside it , the frowsy outlines of the barn and corrals that were once the Kelly family ranch . No one had lived here in five years . It was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mid-fifties prefab , already falling apart when she was growing up . Her father had spent all his money on the land . Pulling off the road just below the brow of the hill , she glanced toward the nearby arroyo . Somebody had surreptitiously dumped a load of broken cinderblocks . Maybe her brother was right and she should sell the place . Taxes were going up , and the house had long ago passed the point of no return . Why was she holding on to it ? She could n't afford to build her own place there-not on an assistant professor 's salary , anyway . She could see the lights coming on in the Gonzales ranch house , a quarter mile away . It was a real working ranch , not like her father 's hobby ranchito . Teresa Gonzales , a girl she 'd grown up with , now ran the place by herself . A big , smart , fearless woman . In recent years , she 'd taken it upon herself to look after the Kelly ranch , too . Every time kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take potshots at the place , Teresa rousted them and left a message on the answering machine at Nora 's townhouse . This time , for the past three or four nights , Teresa had seen dim lights in and around the house just after sunset , and-she thought-large animals slinking about . Nora waited a few minutes , looking for signs of life , but the ranch was quiet and empty . Perhaps Teresa had imagined the lights . In any case , whoever or whatever it was seemed to have left . She eased the truck through the inner gate and down the last two hundred yards of road , parked around back , and killed the engine . Pulling a flashlight out of the glove compartment , she stepped lightly onto the dirt . The door of the house hung open , held precariously by a single hinge screw , its lock cut off long ago with bolt cutters . A gust swept through the yard , picking up skeins of dust and moving the door with a restless whisper . She flicked on the flashlight and stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push , then swung back stubbornly . She gave it an annoyed kick and it fell to the porch with a clatter , loud in the listening silence . She stepped inside . The boarded windows made the interior difficult to make out , yet even so it was clearly a sad echo of her memory of the house she grew up in . Beer bottles and broken glass lay strewn across the floor , and some gang member had spraypainted a tagline on the wall . Some of the boards covering the windows had been pried away . The carpet had been ripped up , and sofa cushions sliced in half and tossed about the room . Holes had been kicked in the drywall , along with liberal pepperings from a .22 . Perhaps it was n't that much worse than the last time . The rips on the cushions were new , along with the ragged holes in the wall , but the rest she remembered from her previous visit . Her lawyer had warned her that in its present condition the place was a liability . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would immediately condemn it . The only problem was , tearing the thing down would cost more than she had-unless , of course , she sold it . She turned from the living room into the kitchen . Her flashlight beam swept over the old Frigidaire , still lying where it had been overturned . Drawers had recently been removed and strewn about the room . The linoleum was coming up in big curls , and someone had hastened the process , peeling off strips and even ripping up floorboards to expose the crawlspace underneath . Vandalism is hard work , she thought . As her eyes roved over the room again , something began to nag at the back of her mind . Something was different this time . She left the kitchen and began to climb the stairs , kicking aside wads of mattress ticking , trying to bring the thought into focus . Sofa cushions sliced , holes punched in walls , carpeting and linoleum ripped up . Somehow , this fresh violence did n't seem quite as random as it had in the past . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the darkness of the stairwell , she stopped . Was that the crunch of glass underfoot ? She waited , motionless in the dim light . There was no sound but the faint susurrus of wind . If a car had driven up , she 'd have heard it . She continued up the stairs . It was even darker up here , all the windowboards still in place . She turned right on the landing and shone the flashlight into her old bedroom . Again she felt the familiar pang as her eyes moved over the pink wallpaper , now hanging in strips and stained like an old map . The mattress was one giant packrat 's nest , the music stand for her oboe broken and rusted , the floorboards sprung . A bat squeaked overhead , and Nora remembered the time she 'd been caught trying to make a pet out of one of them . Her mother had never understood her childish fascination for the creatures . She moved across the hall to her brother 's room , also a wreck . Not so different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought she detected the faintest scent of crushed flowers in the night air . Strange-the windows are all shuttered up here . She moved down the hall toward her parents ' bedroom . This time , there was no mistaking it : the faint tinkle of broken glass from below . She stopped again . Was it a rat , scuttling across the living room floor ? She moved silently back to the top of the landing , then paused . There was another sound from below : a faint thud . As she waited in the darkness , she heard another crunch , sharper this time , as something heavy stepped on broken glass . Nora exhaled slowly , a tight knot of muscle squeezing her chest . What had begun as an irritating errand now felt like something else entirely . " Who is it ? " she called out . Only the wind answered . She swung the flashlight beam into the empty stairwell . Usually , kids would run at the first sight of her truck . Not this time . " This is private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you 're trespassing . The police are on their way . " In the ensuing silence , there came another footpad , closer to the stairwell . " Teresa ? " Nora called again , in a desperate hope . And then she heard something else : a throaty , menacing sound that was almost a growl . Dogs , she thought with a sudden flood of relief . There were feral dogs out there , and they 'd been using the house as a shelter . She chose not to think about why this was somehow a comforting thought . " Yah ! " she cried , waving the light . " Get on out of here ! Go home ! " Again , silence was the only reply . Nora knew how to handle stray dogs . She stomped down the stairs , speaking loudly and firmly . Reaching the bottom , she swept the beam across the living room . It was empty . The dogs must have run at the sound of her approach . Nora took a deep breath . Even though she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time to go . As she headed for the door , she heard another careful footstep , then another , excruciatingly slow and deliberate . She flashed her light toward the sounds as something else registered : a faint , breathy wheeze , a low , monotonous purring mutter . That same scent of flowers wafted through the heavy air , this time stronger . She stood motionless , paralyzed by the unfamiliar feeling of menace , wondering if she should switch off the flashlight and hide herself or simply make a run for it . And then out of the corner of her eye she saw a huge , pelted form racing along the wall . She turned to confront it as a stunning blow landed across her back . She fell sprawling , feeling coarse fur at the nape of her neck . There was a maniacal wet growling , like the slavered fighting of rabid hounds . She lashed into the figure with a vicious kick . The figure snarled but relaxed its grip slightly , giving Nora a moment to wrench free . Just as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw her to the ground , landing atop her . Nora twisted , feeling broken glass digging into her skin as the dark form pinned her to the ground . She glimpsed a naked belly , covered with glowing spots ; jaguar stripes ; claws of horn and hair ; a midriff , dank and matted-wearing a belt of silver conchos . Narrow eyes , terrifyingly red and bright , stared at her from grimy slits in a buckskin mask . " Where is it ? " a voice rasped in her face , washing her in the cloyingly sweet stench of rotten meat . She could not find the voice to reply . " Where is it ? " the voice repeated , crude , imperfect , like a beast aping human speech . Vicelike claws grasped her roughly around the neck and right arm . " What- " she croaked . " The letter , " it said , claws tightening . " Or we rip your head off . " She jerked in sudden fevered struggle , but the grip on her neck grew stronger . She began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash of light and a deafening blast cut through the darkness . She felt the grip slacken , and in a frenzy she twisted free of the claws . She rolled over as a second blast ripped a hole in the ceiling overhead , showering her with bits of lathe and plaster . She scrambled desperately to her feet , shards of glass skittering across the floor . Her flashlight had rolled away , and she spun around , disoriented . " Nora ? " she heard . " That you , Nora ? " Framed in the dim light of the front door , a plump figure was standing , shotgun hanging forward . " Teresa ! " Nora sobbed . She stumbled toward the light . " You okay ? " Teresa asked , grabbing Nora 's arm , steadying her . " I do n't know . " " Let 's get the hell out of here . " Outside , Nora sank to the ground , gulping the cool twilight air and fighting down her pounding heart . " What happened ? " she heard Teresa ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw your light . " Nora simply shook her head , gasping . " Those were some hellacious-looking wild dogs . Big as wolves , almost . " Nora shook her head again . " No . Not dogs . One of them spoke to me . " Teresa peered at her more closely . " Hey , your arm looks bitten . Maybe you 'd better let me drive you to the hospital . " " Absolutely not . " But Teresa was scanning the dim outlines of the house , eyebrows knitted . " They sure did leave in a hurry . First kids , now wild dogs . But what kind of dogs could vanish so- " " Teresa , one of them spoke to me . " Teresa looked at her , more searchingly this time , a skeptical look creeping into her eyes . " Must 've been pretty terrifying , " she said at last . " You should 've told me you were coming out . I 'd have met you down here with Seor Winchester . " She patted the gun fondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but capable face . She knew the woman did n't believe her , but she did n't have the energy to argue . " Next time I will , " she said . " I hope there wo n't be a next time , " said Teresa gently . " You need to either tear this place down , or sell it and let someone else tear it down for you . It 's becoming a problem , and not just for you . " " I know it 's an eyesore . But I just hate to think of letting it go . I 'm sorry it 's caused trouble for you . " " I would 've thought this might change your mind . Want to come in for a bite of something ? " " No thanks , Teresa , " Nora said as firmly as she could . " I 'm all right . " " Maybe , " came the reply . " But you better get a rabies shot anyway . " Nora watched as her neighbor turned onto the narrow trail that headed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's seat of her truck and locked all the doors with a shaking hand . She sat quietly , feeling the air move in and out of her lungs , watching Teresa 's dim form merge slowly with the dark bulk of the hillside . When at last she felt in full control of her limbs , she reached for the ignition , wincing at a sudden stab of pain in her neck . She turned over the engine , unsuccessfully , and cursed . She needed a new vehicle , along with a new everything else in her life . She tried it again , and after a sputtering protest the engine coughed into life . She punched off the headlights to conserve the battery and , slouching back against the seat , gently pumped the accelerator , waiting for the engine to clear . To one side , a flash of silver winked briefly . She turned to see a huge shape , black and furred , bounding toward her against the last twilight in the western sky . Nora slammed the old truck into gear , punched on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response and she went fishtailing out of the yard . As she careened through the inside gate , she saw with consummate horror that the thing was racing alongside her . She jammed the accelerator to the floor as the truck slewed across the ranch road , spraying mad patterns of dirt , whacking a cholla . And then , the thing was gone . But she continued to accelerate down the road to the outer gate , wheels pounding the washboard . After an unbearably long moment , her headlights finally picked up the outer cattle guard looming from the darkness ahead , the row of old mailboxes nailed to a long horizontal board beside it . Too late , Nora jammed on the brakes ; the truck struck the cattle guard and was airborne . She landed heavily and skidded in the sand , striking the old board . There was the crunch of splintering wood and the boxes were flung to the ground . She sat in the truck , breathing hard , dust smoking up around her lights . She dropped into reverse and gunned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep sand . She rocked twice before the truck stalled . In the glow of the headlights , she could see the damage . The row of ranch mailboxes had been a rickety affair to begin with , and they had recently been supplanted by a shiny new set of post office boxes that stood nearby . But she could not back up : there was no choice but to go forward . She jumped out and , glancing around for any sign of the figure , moved around to the front of the truck , picked up the rotten , abandoned mailboxes , and dragged them aside into the brush . An envelope lay in the dirt , and she grabbed it . As she turned to step back into the truck , the headlights caught the front of the envelope . Nora froze for a moment , gasping in surprise . Then she shoved it in her shirt pocket , jumped into the truck , and peeled back onto the road , careening toward the distant , welcoming lights of town .
