teri hatcher Desperate Housewives ' Teri Hatcher is done settling for less . She 's done with secrets . She 's done wearing the brave face . Instead , the award-winning actress is discovering the amazing value in letting herself be vulnerable . // You ca n't always avoid the curveballs life throws you . But , if you 're like Teri Hatcher , you can let them make you stronger . Teri has faced two divorces , sexual abuse as a child ( which she spoke about publicly for the first time in early March ) , and the highs and lows of Hollywood fame-going from sought-after TV star to out-of-work actress hawking electronics in two short years . Teri rolled with these punches , returning triumphantly to the public spotlight in 2004 as the lovably bumbling desperate housewife Susan . This month , Teri shares the hard-earned wisdom she 's gained from her ordinary struggles and extraordinary life in a startlingly honest and uplifting book , Burnt Toast . " It 's been an intense journey , " she says over dinner at a restaurant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book is bringing up as many issues as writing it . But I do n't want people to get the idea that I 'm a changed person . My celebrity aside , I am a woman like every other woman in terms of that pendulum that is always swinging between confidence and vulnerability . I 'm a work in progress . At any moment during any day I can go from feeling very capable to very raw . " In person-and in her book-Teri has an endearing , sometimes shocking knack for brutally exposing her moments of self-doubt with an irresistible , self-deprecating sense of humor . She 's been through tough times , but knows herself better because of them . " Every woman has different reasons for arriving into their 30s and 40s with this idea of " less than , ' ' " she says , " thinking they deserve less than other people , and their struggles with that . The journey of my childhood , my marriages , of being a mother , of not having a job , then having one-they all brought up different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at and deal with . But my sense of humor has always been able to shine through even during my lowest of lows , and that somehow helps me know I will survive whatever it is . " With a sweet daughter , Emerson , now 8 , and a mantelful of awards ( including a Golden Globe and the prestigious Screen Actors ' Guild Award ) , Teri 's doing more than surviving these days-she 's thriving . In fact , she says she 's really missing only one thing : a man . " I recently had my first date in months . When it comes to something like love , you just have to keep going for it . " And she plans to . " I still do n't always make the right choices , " she says , " but I believe that if you 're coming from a truthful , generous point , whatever the result is , it ca n't be bad . " WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO WRITE BURNT TOAST ? I was doing the Barbara Walters Oscar special last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toast " eating a piece of burnt toast instead of throwing it away and starting fresh , I 'd just turned 40 and did n't want to settle for that anymore . A lot of women wrote in to the show , responding to that idea of not settling . And then publishers came to me and asked me if I wanted to write a book . It was important to me to kind of expose myself . I wanted to be very vulnerable and not be afraid to say , " Here 's what it 's been like for me , and you , as a woman , can take out of it what works for you . " I 've had lots of pain in my life , but I 've had lots of blessings as well . I 'm sure plenty of women out there think . Well , what could be hard for you ? From the outside my life looks so fabulous . But in all my work with women and charity organizations-and even just with friends-I really try and stress that no matter what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are all the same human beings trying to deal with the same feelings , struggles , and fears . HOW HAVE YOU CHANGED AS YOU 'VE GOTTEN OLDER ? I 've definitely come a very long way in terms of having more patience and giving people a break . I 've also come a long way in letting myself need others more . When I came home from the REDBOOK shoot the other day , I was so exhausted . I had worked late nights all week , and when I got home , my ex-husband actor Jon Tenney was dropping off Emerson . He said to me , " How are you ? " And I just stood there on the doorstep and started sobbing . He held me , and as I was standing there sobbing , I said . " Thank you for holding me ; I really need you to hold me , and I 'm sorry I did n't let myself need you more in our marriage , because that probably did n't feel that good . " We 're not getting back together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriend . But in that moment , I was able to say that I needed him out loud-that is an amazing shift for me . " Letting your children see that you can survive a lot of feelings is a great tool . " DO YOU LET EMERSON SEE THE SELF-DOUBTING TERI AS WELL AS THF CONFIDENT , IN-CONTROL ONE ? Definitely . She can tell most of the time when I 'm sad or not sad . I 'm not afraid to say to her that I feel kind of sad today and that I wish I was laughing and happy and that it will go away . The last couple of months have been rough . HOW HAVE THESE LAST MONTHS BEEN ROUGH ? Things feel a little raw right now . I tried to explain that to Emerson by pointing to my arm , like , " Here 's Mommy over here , and here 's happiness over here , and in the middle is all this mucky guck , and sometimes you get one foot stuck in the guck . " I think letting your children see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and survive them is a great tool , rather than just trying to be happy all the time . If we teach our children that they can work through their feelings , they 'll understand the ups and downs more when they come . HAS BEING A MOM COME NATURALLY TO YOU ? No , I actually think it 's the opposite . Some people are good parents because they had good role models . I think I 'm a good parent because I saw what did n't work with my own mother and father . Not that they did n't do anything good . But I did see very clearly what did n't work and I knew I would n't act the same way . I think our generation is luckier in that we had the opportunity to be a little more soul-searching and questioning in a way that our mothers did not . Self-examination was not something they had the time for or were encouraged to do . DO YOU WANT MORE KIDS ? Emerson and I were just talking about that last night . It is something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I never thought Emerson would be an only child . But it also brings up all these other comparisons , like , there would be two different fathers for these children , and would I adopt or would I go to a sperm bank ? And , certainly , 41 is the beginning of the push against the biological clock . But it 's not a closed door . It 's a very thoughtintensive issue for me right now . But if I do have another , Emerson says it has to be a girl ! DO YOU THINK WOMEN CAN BE SUCCESSFUL WORKING FULL-TIME , RAISING WELL-ADJUSTED CHILDREN , AND HAVING A HAPPY RELATIONSHIP ? I think our expectations of life are that things should be perfect and anything short of that is failure-so then the answer would be no . But , finally , life for me is more than having it all . For me it 's more that you can experience it all . It 's not like you get it and you 're done : I got the man-okay , that 's done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the career-done . Life is not a checklist . " I want to believe there 's a guy out there who 's going to get me and love me . " IN WHAT WAY ARE YOU STILL A " WORK IN PROGRESS " ? I still struggle with my confidence with men . You know , Why would anyone want to go out on a date with me ? And all those questions that flood vour brain when a guy stops calling , like , Was I too needy ? This Valentine 's Day I bought myself that book He 's Just Not That Into You , just to try and understand that it 's not my fault . HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT LIVING THE SINGLE LIFE ? The more the tabloids say I 'm dating someone , and I 'm not , you compare it to the reality of how empty your heart really is . The tabloids were reporting how I was out with someone on Valentine 's Day . And the fact is , I was at the bookstore buying that book , and buying myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be the eternal optimist . I want to believe there is that guy out there who is going to get me , love me , and not hurt me . DO PEOPLE OFTEN TRY TO FIX YOU UP ON DATES ? They try to , but I hardly ever go . It 's just weird , and I do n't think it 's just because I 'm a celebrity . It 's harder to meet new people when you 're older . I mean , you ca n't really do that whole " Well , I grew up here and went to school there " thing . I mean , what do you say ? WHEN WAS YOUR MOST RECENT BLIND DATE ? Not too long ago . He was gorgeous and sweet , but I was kind of just sitting there not really knowing what to say . Doing the blind date thing is really hard because it 's never going to be completely blind on his end . But this particular guy was n't American and he did n't really know me or the show , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF PERSONAL THINGS IN YOUR BOOK , BUT NOT MUCH ABOUT EITHER OF YOUR MARRIAGES . WHY NOT ? It was purposeful . The first marriage , I was so young and it lasted such a short time that it just did n't feel relevant . The second marriage , there were a lot of complications , and because I share parenting responsibilities with Jon , I felt it was n't my place to talk about him . It 's not up to me to explore his thing . I did n't want to write a tell-all or anything nasty . Ultimately , the most important point is that today , we start taking responsibility for the life we want to have . Taking responsibility is not about placing blame . BUT DID N'T YOU LEARN ABOUT YOURSELF THROUGH THE FAILURE OF YOUR MARRIAGE ? Let 's just say I do n't think I 've ever been in love in the way I 've fantasized about being in love . There was something very sale and good about Jon that worked for both of us , but it probably was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I just think it gets too personal . " People have forgotten that I 'm sexy . " FIVE YEARS AGO , WOULD YOU HAVE HAD THE CONFIDENCE TO WEAR THE REVEALING DRESS YOU WORE TO THE 2006 GRAMMYS ? Five years ago , no one would have invited me to the Grammys ! I remember when I left the house that night , I told my stylist I thought it was a risk wearing that dress . But that dress is where I 'm at right now . I was n't trying to say anything to anyone . I was trying to say to myself . I 'm a 41-year-old woman , I look fantastic . I do n't take a lot of risks , and I need to embrace my sexuality a little bit more . HOW DID THAT DRESS HELP ? It helped me remind myself and everyone else that I am a sexual being . And sexuality is humorous and fun and bold . I think one of the reasons people flipped out so much was because it was so not me . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , I was considered " bombshell , " " bitch , " " sex " - whatever . Now that I 've been playing Susan on Desperate Housewives and become identified with this vulnerable , light-things-on-fire comedian , people have forgotten I 'm sexy . People like to pigeonhole you into one thing they understand . DO YOU THINK HOUSEWIVES ACROSS THE COUNTRY FACE THE SAME ISSUES AS THE DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES CHARACTERS ? Well , let 's face it : You do n't have that many moms passing out on their lawn . But you definitely have wives who turn to drinking to solve their problems . I think it 's a heightened version of reality . That 's what makes it entertaining-it 's a little bit bigger than your real life . But a lot of the stuff they go through is about feelings we all have . Like my character , Susan , and her particular struggles to make love work-that 's my life too . But we just shot a bunch of episodes where Susan once again tries to lie her way out of something . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned her lesson yet ? " They told me , " We think Susan is the kind of person who just panics and makes the wrong decision . " And I agree ; she does always do that . But I do n't totally do that . I do n't ever panic and I do n't lie . So that 's what 's fun about playing her . I have to live with me 24/7 and I do n't want to have to do that when I go to work . DO YOU RELATE TO SUSAN MORE EASILY THAN THE OTHER HOUSEWIVES ? Not necessarily . I think Bree is a painful , complicated character who 's very repressed and I understand some of that . I understand Lynette 's guilt and the turmoil created by her working . My whole life is scheduled around when I can shove in my work so that it happens when my daughter is at a playdate or at school . I think all the characters have qualities that women can understand , but at the same time there 's value in the out-and-out entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Housewives , I would completely understand that that hour between 9 and 10 on Sunday night I could have for just me . IF THE SHOW ENDED TODAY , WHAT WOULD YOU DO ? I have a bazillion other things in my life . I could live in a one-bedroom house in Idaho and drive my ' ' 78 VW van . The thrills that come with the job are fun , but not necessary . That 's the thing about having the success the second time around : I totally know that it will go away . When this job ends I 'll be bummed out , but I 'm smart enough to protect myself , my daughter , and my future . DO YOU BELIEVE IN REGRETS ? I 'm the kind of person who will wake up at 3 in the morning and think about something I might have done 18 years ago that I should n't have done . But in general I know that 's a total waste of energy . I might not have handled certain situations in the past as well as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .
