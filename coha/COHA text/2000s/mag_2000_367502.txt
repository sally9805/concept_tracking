Add one more to the list of myths exploded by the record U.S. boom . Remember when any unemployment rate lower than 6% , or any rise in national output of more than 2.5% , was supposed to light a bonfire of inflation ? Come on , it was n't that long ago  --  those beliefs died even harder than the ' 80s idea that the U.S. was becoming a corporate colony of Japan . And as late as the end of 1998 , some economists feared that a ballooning U.S. trade deficit and the launch of a rival international currency , the euro , would send the American dollar into a headlong slide  --  maybe even a " dollar crisis . " <P> What has happened is the exact opposite . Far from becoming dangerously weak , the dollar , if anything , may be a bit too strong . So far this year it has risen about 6% on average against the currencies of the 19 most important U.S. trading partners . In May the greenback hit a four-year high against the British pound , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $1.17 , fell briefly below 90cents . <P> The development is great for U.S. tourists abroad ; especially in Europe and Canada , they will need fewer dollars to buy a hotel room , a dinner , a bus ride or whatever . But it may also seem especially mystifying because America has been spilling more dollars abroad than pessimists feared . The U.S. deficit on current account , which measures all sorts of money flows  --  merchandise imports vs. exports , trade in services , tourist spending , investment flows  --  jumped more than 50% in 1999 to almost $339 billion . This year it seems headed higher still , to around $400 billion . In theory that creates an excessive supply of dollars in the world . Like an excessive supply of wheat or anything else , that ought to drive down the international price of a buck . <P> As with so many other things these days , though , classical theory is being rewritten by the sheer strength and dynamism of the American economy . Not only is the U.S. growing faster than any other major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity that promises to keep growth going well into the future , if a bit less exuberantly than today . And , for all Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 's fears of renewed inflation , price and wage increases have not eaten up any significant part of the gains . <P> Accordingly , the U.S. right now is the best place in the world to invest . So foreigners are sending back to the U.S. , as investments , many of the dollars they accumulate in trade and other business dealings . That trend keeps global demand for dollars high enough to balance  --  or even outbalance  --  the increased supply . <P> Just under $151 billion of net direct investment  --  money to build plants or buy companies  --  poured into the U.S. last year , mostly from Europe . An additional $160 billion net , again mostly from Europe , flooded into purchases of U.S. corporate bonds ; overseas investors actually snapped up more than two-thirds of all this debt issued in 1999 by American corporations . In 1998 U.S. buying of foreign stocks exceeded foreign purchases of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , pulling $108 billion more into the U.S.
