HE 'S MOVIN ' OUT <P> When fellow middle-aged New York songwriter Paul Simon staged The Cape Man , his first musical on Broadway , he wrote all new material . The show tanked . So BILLY JOEL is n't taking any chances . When he tests the waters on the Great White Way in October , he 'll use songs that are already proven hits . Conceived by modern-dance guru Twyla Tharp , who will also choreograph and direct , Movin ' Out will use the successful formula of Mamma Mia ! , the hit Broadway show in which a story line has been concocted to accompany the greatest hits of ABBA . The plot of Movin ' Out will follow six friends from 1967 , when audiences will surely be treated to a rendition of Goodbye Saigon , to 1987 , which seems a natural for Easy Money . The show will have a pre-Broadway run in Chicago , then begin previews in New York in September .

As he revealed to the Los Angeles Times , his greatest " nightmare " is " finishing up like Harold Robbins , " the novelist who churned out books into his 80s . King said he worries about repeating himself , which seems inevitable , since he 's published at least a book a year since 1974 . He plans to finish the last three novels in his " Dark Tower " series and this fall publish From a Buick Eight , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chances are it will be abnormal in ways different from Christine , but at least we 'll probably be spared a novel about children who worship sweet potatoes . <P> SHE 'S SPEAKING OUT <P> ROSIE O'DONNELL is not shy about much , but on matters of her sexual orientation , she has remained coy . There was that moment last year when she dedicated her Daytime Emmy Award to Kelli , which is not the name of any of her three adopted children . And last week she guest-starred on Will &; Grace playing a lesbian . But with the publication in April of her autobiography , Find Me , O'Donnell walks right up to making her orientation clear . A publicist at Warner Books confirms that O'Donnell ruminates on her romantic relationships with women but says the issue of O'Donnell 's sexuality takes up only a small portion of the book . No doubt it will be the portion most widely discussed , including this question : Could it be that O'Donnell 's crush on Tom Cruise is really just an appreciation of his acting ? <P> SHE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
