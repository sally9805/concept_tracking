Are FDA plans sufficient ? <p> At least seven million Americans suffer from food allergies . Each year , more than 30,000 of them need to be rushed to emergency rooms for treatment . As many as 200 of them die . More people die each year from allergy-induced anaphylaxis ( shock ) than from bee stings . <p> Even small amounts of common food ingredients  --  substances that are benign and ' healthy for others  --  can cause severe or fatal reactions in persons who are allergic to them . Such individuals become diligent label readers , but are frustrated by labels that lack the information they need . <p> Unfamiliar Terms and Hidden Ingredients . The Nutrition , Labeling , and Education Act of 1990 ( NLEA ) required more information on food labels than had ever been required before . However , individuals with food allergies , intolerances , and sensitivities continue to struggle to interpret labels that list unfamiliar terms or fail to identify clearly ingredients that may harm them . <p> A dairy-allergic individual may not recognize more than 15 different label terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " casein " ; a caseinate compound such as ammonium , calcium , magnesium , potassium , rennet , or sodium caseinate ; " curds " ; or " whey , " to name some . Similarly , an individual who is allergic to eggs may not recognize a term such as " albumin " ; nor a wheat-allergic person know if wheat has been used for the starch to produce " modified food starch , " or that " semolina " is wheat flour . <p> " Incidental additives " ( contaminants ) and " processing aids " ( e.g. , firming agents , texturizers , or binders ) are exempt from ingredient declarations if they are present at " insignificant " amounts in the finished product . Yet , an exceedingly small amount may be significant if it is capable of inducing an allergic reaction . <p> The phrase " may contain " on a food label has been used in phrases such as " may contain cottonseed and/or peanut oil " to allow food processors latitude in their choice of ingredients , depending on fluctuating costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to individuals who must avoid certain ingredients . Selecting food products becomes a gamble as to whether or not the item contains an allergen . <p> In recent times , the phrase " may contain " is being used even more insidiously . The phrase  --  worded in at least 10 different ways  --  cautions that an allergen , such as peanuts , may or may not be in the food product as an incidental additive . The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network ( FAAN ) charges that some food companies are misusing this labeling phrase merely to cover legal liability . The FAAN suggests that the phrase should not be used to allow a diminution of good manufacturing practices that would keep unintentional contaminants out of the product . <p> Food manufacturers can use terms such as " natural flavors , " " natural seasonings , " or " natural colors . " These vague terms may cover ingredients that are hidden allergens . Non-certified colors can be listed collectively , without specific identification . Yet most of them , derived from plant substances , may be more allergenic than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , individuals with food allergies have complained that they have been unable to obtain information about suspected hidden ingredients in food products because some manufacturers fail to respond to such requests . The FAAN encourages food companies to cooperate , and to provide toll-free hotlines for consumers . <p> In addition to allergic individuals , other groups also need better ingredient information on food labels . Some individuals have food intolerances ( e.g. , lactose , fructose , galactose , or gluten ) . Such intolerances are genetic health problems triggered by mechanisms that differ from those of allergies . Nonetheless , these individuals also suffer when labels lack adequate information to meet their needs . <p> Other people have certain food sensitivities , and react adversely to ingredients or food additives at levels well below official limits . The Food and Drug Administration has acknowledged this problem in regulating two different groups of food additives commonly used in food products . The FDA mandates that if food processors use any of six sulfiting agents ( sulfur dioxide , sodium sulfite , potassium bisulfite , sodium bisulfite , potassium metabisulfite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the label . The FDA instituted this regulation after numerous cases of asthmatic attacks and even deaths were found to be induced by sulfiting agents . Also , the FDA mandates that if the coloring , tartrazine ( FD &C; Yellow No. 5 ) , is used in foods , drugs , or cosmetics , then it must be declared specifically on the label . The FDA instituted this regulation after numerous medical reports described patients who experienced adverse reaction to this color . In both instances , with sulfiting agents and tartrazine , consumers are given clear label warnings . These mandates can serve as precedents for more informative labeling to meet the needs of individuals with food allergies , food intolerances , and food sensitivities . <p> Regretfully , there are additional individuals whose needs probably will not be met , because the FDA believes it has already taken care of the problem . Unfortunatey , it has not . Many persons react adversely to the flavor enhancer , monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) , widely used by food processors . The FDA has mandated that MSG 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this action , it scarcely begins to address the problem . MSG is present , but hidden , in many other forms . Some products always contain MSG , such as hydrolyzed protein ( also known as protein hydrolysate ) , sodium caseinate , yeast food , yeast extract , yeast nutrient , autolyzed yeast , textured protein , and hydrolyzed oat flour . In addition , other compounds may contain MSG , such as malt extract ; malt flavoring ; bouillon ; barley malt ; commercial broths , stocks , and flavoring(s) ; natural beef , chicken , or pork flavorings and seasonings . Also , some enzymes used in food processing , such as protease enzymes , fungal protease , and protease , actually may create MSG . Even more substances are suspected as hidden MSG sources . <p> Hidden MSG is not limited to food use . Toiletries also contain hidden MSG in " hydrolyzed protein , " and " amino acids . " Hidden MSG may be present in binders for medications , prescription and nonprescription drugs , nutritional supplements , and enteral as well as intravenously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally in foods , is mostly bound to protein , and does not induce adverse reactions . Glutamate in MSG is unbound ( in a free state ) , and does induce adverse reactions . For MSG to be effective as a flavor enhancer , the glutamate must be in a free state . <p> Adverse reactions to MSG are dose-related . Some people react adversely to exceedingly small amounts , far below the officially tolerated level . In some people , MSG reactions may occur almost immediately . In others , reactions may be delayed for as long as 48 hours , making it difficult to relate cause to effect . Although many people react unfavorably to MSG , this substance is not on the FDA 's list of food allergens that may need better labeling . The agency feels that it has already addressed the problem . <p> The FDA 's Enforcement Powers . The FDA has several types of enforcement powers applicable to specific categories of products . The agency can send warning letters if food companies  --  do not voluntarily recall products that may pose health problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall power . The agency can conduct seizures , or take more drastic measures , using injunctions , prosecutions , and fines . <p> In recent years , the FDA has chosen communication , persuasion , and cooperation with industry , rather than using the legal apparatus to achieve compliance . As a result , the numbers of seizures , injunctions , and prosecutions have declined ; warning letters and recalls have increased . In 1978 , there were 21 prosecutions ; by 1998 , none . Over the same time span , injunctions declined from 32 to 11 ; seizures , from 402 to 35 ; warning letters increased , from 422 to 908 ; and recalls , from 1,116 to 3,528 . The agency is satisfied that cooperation and communication are working effectively . <p> These enforcement measures have been taken for various problems , including mislabeling resulting from the presence of undeclared allergens . However , according to Joseph Levitt , Director of the FDA 's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition , undeclared allergens now result in more Class I recalls(*) by food companies than food-borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be well publicized as a major food problem . Indeed , in recent years , recalls have increased because of hidden allergens in improperly labeled foods . In 1996 , there were 35 Class I recalls of 57 products , and 22 Class II recalls of 39 products . In 1997 , there were 35 Class I recalls of 70 products and 58 Class II recalls of 240 products . Both the number of recalls and the number of food products involved because of undeclared allergens continued to increase . <p> The FDA received more and more reports from various sources concerning food products with hidden allergens . Letters were received from consumers , allergy support groups , food companies , state health departments , and the FDA inspectors . <p> The FDA Investigates Food Allergens in Products . Following an increased number of food-allergen-related recalls , in October 1998 , the FDA assigned a field office investigation through its Minneapolis district . Officers were sent to inspect 85 randomly selected ice cream , candy , and baking plants in Minnesota and Wisconsin . The field officers were assisted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one anticipated how revelatory and seminal this investigation would be . <p> The investigation was narrow in scope . Inspection was limited to relatively few companies and to relatively few types of food-processing operations . Testing was limited to only two of the eight widely ' acknowledged major allergens : peanuts and eggs . The other major allergens were not within the scope of the investigation . <p> Even within this limited investigation , the findings were surprising . Some 25% of finished food products tested were found to contain undeclared peanut allergens . Eighteen out of 73 samples tested positive for undeclared peanuts , and five out of 46 samples tested positive for undeclared egg protein residue . <p> Many problems resulted from cross contamination . For example , some bakers used the same utensils to stir separate mixes , and reused baking sheets between batches without washing them . In some candy manufacturing plants , English toffee was made on the same production line as peanut clusters . The toffee and clusters were produced at different times but with the same machinery . At one candy company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently , there was no thorough cleaning between runs at some companies . Inspectors were surprised to learn that only slightly more than half of the manufacturers had any policy of testing the products to ensure that all ingredients were listed accurately . Some companies said that , on the advice of their lawyers , they will not do testing because the results might be used against them in lawsuits . <p> Obviously , if this limited study was representative of many companies in various types of food processings , then there was a national problem . The FDA needed to address the issue . <p> Meanwhile , some state officials were receiving so many complaints that the attorneys general in nine states decided to investigate . After assembling their data , in November 2000 , the attorneys general petitioned the FDA for regulatory reform of food labeling to require labels to declare any allergens present . The attorneys general 's proposal addressed the consumers ' grievances about hidden ingredients and unlisted incidental additives as well as the consumers ' frustrations about being unable to obtain additional product information from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a symbolic " A " ( for allergens ) to be placed on the front panel of food labels for all products containing allergens . They also suggested certain reforms in manufacturing processes , including ways to eliminate cross contamination . <p> FDA Proposes Actions . In January 2001 , the FDA released a report , " Food Allergen Partnership , " with the results of its field study in Wisconsin and Minnesota . The findings served as a wake-up call . <p> At the same time , the FDA issued a " Dear Colleague " letter to the food industry , expressing the agency 's continued concern about undeclared allergens in food products . The letter announced that the FDA would be issuing an allergen inspection guide to its field offices " to provide investigators with an inspection tool designed to identify industry problem areas that could result in undeclared allergens . " In addition , the agency announced that it would develop interactive training programs for investigators and publish a draft " Food Allergen Compliance Policy Guide . " <p> In February 2001 , Joseph Levitt , Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nutrition , announced that " addressing the very real issue of food allergens needs to be a priority for us all . It is an important public health risk that , with proper attention , can be effectively reduced . " <p> Levitt reported that the FDA was eager to work with food manufacturers to put better information on labels to help consumers identify allergens . The strategy would be to focus on the eight major food allergens : milk , eggs , wheat , tree nuts , peanuts , soybeans , finfish , and shellfish . The agency may consider other allergens in the future . <p> At the same time , Levitt announced a proposed rule requiring that the presence of carmine/cochineal extract ( a color additive ) be declared specifically in the ingredient listing of food products . Formerly , this red color , derived from a dried insect body ( Coccus cacti ) , had been exempt from certification and not listed by name on food labels . Unlike colors derived from plant sources , carmine/cochineal is not Kosher certified . Nor is it acceptable to vegetarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorant can be viewed as an extension of the FDA 's previous precedent established to declare tartrazine 's presence on labels . <p> The FDA took additional actions , with spices , flavors , and colors , in its " Guidance " to industry ( published May 2 , 2001 in the Federal Register ) . Formerly , these ingredients had been exempt from labeling regulations , and processors were not legally obliged to specify the ingredients contained in spices , flavors , and colors used in food products . Setting a new precedent , the FDA stated in its " Guidance " that " the exemption ( for spices , flavors , and colors ) does not apply to allergenic ingredients . " The FDA had concluded that allergens with severe toxicity for some consumers must be labeled , no matter where they are found in food products . " Evidence indicates that some food allergens can cause serious reactions in sensitive individuals upon ingestion of very small amounts ; therefore , the presence of an allergen must be declared " ( emphasis supplied ) . The FDA advised processors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly allergy-free foods , and to keep allergenic and non-allergenic ingredients apart by using specifically designated equipment . " Manufacturers should schedule production of allergenic and allergenic-free food products at different times and at different locations . Manufacturers should improve sanitation procedures , especially with machinery . <p> Actually , the FDA 's Guidance recommendations have been followed by food manufacturers who abide by Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP ) diligently . The practices are embedded , too , in the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points ( HACCP ) systems that have been required in recent years to lessen the risks of food contamination and resulting food-borne illnesses . Also , Kosher food plants adhere to their self-imposed strict guidelines for sanitation that could serve as a model for other food manufacturers . <p> The Food Industry 's Actions . Although the FDA 's Guidance called mostly for voluntary compliance of the food industry , Congress was preparing to introduce legislation mandating stringent regulations . Among them was the use of warning symbols on food products containing potential allergens . Warning symbols are anathema to food processors who regard their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took prompt preemptive measures to avert federal legislation , and argued that the FDA 's voluntary " Guidance " was sufficient . <p> Food companies have a strong financial incentive to make changes . Regina Hildwine , food labeling director of the National Food Producers Association ( NFPA ) , a major food trade group representing about 400 companies , announced : " We are happy that the marketplace drives this issue . " Rhona Applebaum , NFPA 's executive vice president , added that the FDA 's proposals " will be useful in helping the industry to further enhance its efforts to ensure that all potential food allergens are clearly labeled on food packages , and that no inadvertent allergens are contained in food products . " <p> NFPA released its industry " Code of Practices " and recommended that its members follow them : Label major food allergens in terms that consumers can understand . Use good manufacturing practices and allergen-control strategies to minimize potential cross-contact of major food allergens . If good manufacturing practices , or other allergen-control strategies are unreliable , ingredient declarations or supplementary information would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and operational strategies to reduce the risk of allergic consumers ingesting food allergens . <p> Some of the " Code of Practices " is echoed by the Food Allergy Issues Alliance , a group of food trade associations and other interested organizations , that convenes to discuss issues related to food allergies . The group suggests numerous changes in manufacturing practices and processes to reduce the potential of cross-contact with major food allergens . The group advocates the use of label terms commonly understood in " plain English " within , or in immediate proximity to the ingredient declaration to provide clear communication with food-allergic consumers . The Alliance recommends the use of bolding or other highlighting of lettering within the ingredient declaration , or the placement of an allergy information statement  --  with conspicuous and accurate wording  --  in immediate proximity to the ingredient declaration . <p> With a heightened awareness of the problems of hidden food allergens , improvements are on the way . Labeling changes have been a continuing process since NLEA 's inception in 1990 . The FDA is considering petitions for other modifications of food labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugars , and additional health claims . Noting food allergens on labels will accommodate individuals with food allergies , and is greeted as a welcomed improvement . <p> By Beatrice Trum Hunter <p>
