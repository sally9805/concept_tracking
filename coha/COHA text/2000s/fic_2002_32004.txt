My Life in Heavy Metal Josephine Byron chased me all through college . Nobody could figure this out , not her friends , not mine , nor the frat boys who watched her wag across the wide lawns of our school . She was one of those women invariably referred to as striking , a great big get-a-load-of-that : gleaming black hair , curves like a tulip . Snow White refigured , made warmer , more voluptuous . She was also utterly convinced of herself , her good taste in clothing and men , her beauty and intellect , which she unfurled in earnest , vaguely Marxist jeremiads , while the rest of us gazed at her lips . In the dim , yeasty haze of after parties and the stoned vistas of Hope Hill , on the cruddy avenues of our college town , Jo came to me bearing gifts , a fresh-baked loaf of bread , a Mardi Gras necklace , bearing her sly smile and plump white breasts . She let me have my way with her , though I was never quite sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . At night , she kissed my body all over and in the mornings made me omelets . It was like having " Happy Birthday " sung to me each day : ecstatic and deeply disquieting . A few months after graduating I moved to El Paso , where the daily paper needed a clerk . I lived alone , in a basement , and ate fried chicken from boxes . The shower in my place was like being spit on , so I got in the habit of showering at the YMCA , where I swam a few times a week . The lifeguard was a quiet woman who wore clunky glasses and a red Speedo one-piece with a towel wrapped around her lower body . If I stuck around long enough onWednesdays , she took off the towel and led kiddie classes in the shallow end . She was good with the kids , teasing them in Spanish , holding their bellies while they flailed . Her face was round , bookish , somewhat drab . Even without the glasses her eyes seemed far away . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours at the paper , hoping to distinguish myself . I sent Jo long , maudlin letters . I wanted her to love me again . I had been wrong to treat her with such disregard . At dusk , when the sun relented , I wandered El Paso 's ragged downtown , wallowing in a sadness I considered sophisticated and insoluble . The plaza was always emptying : vendedores and day maids trudging back to Jurez , the sweet stale scent of lard punching out from El Segundo Barrio , the thrum of swamp coolers fallen away . Later , the smelting plant would fire up its chimneys and smoke would drift over the Franklin Mountains , which shadowed the city like a row of brown shrugs . To the east lay the trim , eerie avenues of Fort Bliss . To the west , the terraced estates of Coronado , where the swimming pools glowed like sapphires . For seven months I handled weddings and obits . Then the pop music critic quit , and the managing editor , lacking other recourse , allowed me to sub . El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spandex-and-umlaut circuit that runs the length of 1-10 . I reviewed virtually every one of the late-eighties hair bands at least once : Ratt , Poison , Winger , Warrant , Great White , White Snake , Kiss , Vixen , Cinderella , Queensryche , Skid Row , Def Leppard , Brittney Foxx , and Kiss without makeup . At my first concert , Metallica , the band 's new bassist introduced himself to the crowd by farting into his microphone . This was the heavy metal equivalent of a bon mot . Because we were a morning paper , I had to bang out my copy by midnight . I operated on a template involving an initial bad pun , a lengthy playlistadjective , adjective , song titleand a description of the lead singer 's hair . The rest was your standard catalog of puking yayas , flung undies , poignant duets with the rhythm guitarist back from rehab . I loved the velocity of the process : an event witnessed and recorded overnight . I loved the pressure , the glib improvisation ; I loved seeing my byline the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink and newsprint . And the truth is I loved the shows . I remember standing in the front row as Sebastian Bach , the lead singer of Skid Row , screeched " Youth Gone Wild . " Bach was the quintessential metal front man , a blond mane and a pair of cheekbones . He strutted the stage like a drag queen , while the lead guitarist yanked out an interminable solo and the drummer became a shirtless piston . It was formulaic and mercenary and a little pathetic . But when I stared down the row , I saw twenty heads banging in unison , like angry mops . These were kids lousy with the bad hormones of adolescence , humiliated by the poverty of their prospects , and this was their dance , their chance to be part of some larger phallic brotherhood ; the notes lashed their rib cages , called out to their beautiful , furious wishes . I 'd spoken to the lifeguard a few times , about holiday hours , lane dividers . I imagined having sex with her constantly . I did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeguard it was always more exciting , because we were both almost naked . Her name was Claudia , pronounced in the beautiful Spanish manner , as three distinct , rolling syllables : Cloud-i-ahh . She lived by herself , in an apartment not far from the Y. Every couple of weeks , I took her to some show or another . The idea was that some spark would leap between us . Then we would sneak into the Y , fuck on the squeaky tile , with her bent over a stack of kickboards , or underwater . But she was impossible to read behind her glasses . Our dates were like the ones I had in tenth grade , the tense drive to the mini-golf place , the exhausting formality , the burps unburped . She spoke in the manner of a kindergarten teacher , softly , a bit too clearly , though when she took up Spanish her lisp blossomed and the tip of her tongue danced along her teeth . I felt sure this animation was a sign of some secret life behind her reticence . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Companions in a certain lonely , postgraduate phase . Markers of time . Besides , there was Jo , beautiful Jo , who called me every other weekend , who seemed to be remaining , in her final year of college , faithful to me , assuredly against the counsel of her friends . And who , true to her word , did appear , just a few weeks after her own graduation , marched up the jetway in red suede boots and nearly tackled me . Everyone just stared . How nice it was to have a beautiful woman tackle me , to feel the eyes of the world upon me again , to have a long , soapy body over which to kvell . And how romantic I made El Paso seem . The plaza ! The dollar movies ! The oceanic desert ! I took her to the lookout point at the top of the Franklins , where we necked and , amid the high schoolers and clumps of creosote , made the sweet foolish talk of love renewed . A few days after she 'd flown back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Your ticket ? " " I 'm coming out there . To live . " There was a pause , during which I tried very hard to recall whether we had discussed this plan , while also recognizing that I was expected to make some perfectly spontaneous sound of approval , thanksgiving , hosanna , and , in fact , even as I grasped this , grasped that I had failed , let the moment pass and would now be held accountable , asked to explain , possibly more than once , why I had n't , did n't I love her , had n't I wooed her for a year solid , questions which seemed perfectly reasonable but which I felt incapable of answering because my head was full of pudding . That Sunday I took Claudia to the Metalfest at Bayshore , an artificial lake in the middle of absolutely nowhere , New Mexico . Children tended to drown at Bayshore . No one knew why . The lake was only three feet deep . Heavy metal is an indoor genre . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crowd loses the sense of itself as a powerful tribe . The elaborate fantasy world of smoke and tinted lights and catwalks just does n't work on a stage overlooking scrub . The headliner , Jon Bon Jovi , seemed to recognize this . He took one gander at the pallid crowd and began casting about for a trapdoor . His bangs frizzed in the heat ; his tights bunched . His falsetto drifted up and away with the dust . The show felt forced , and , in the way of such things , a little sad . Afterward , I drove Claudia back to town . " So anyway , " I said , " it looks like that friend of mine from college , Jo , is going to be heading out . " Claudia looked down into her lap . " I guess I wo n't be seeing you as much , then . " " Do n't be silly , " I said . " Why should n't I see you ? " We had n't done anything , after all . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living with you ? " " Yeah . That 's sort of the plan . " " When 's she coming out ? " " Next Sunday , " I said . There was a difficult pause . Claudia stared out the windshield . The tops of her ears looked tender from the sun . " It does n't seem fair , " she said finally . She glanced at me and smiled a little . " You know , you get something , and I lose a friend . " " I do n't know why you 're saying that , " I said . " It 's not like that . " Claudia called me at work the next day . She wanted to have dinner on Saturday night . " Sure , " I said . " Where do you want to go ? " She giggled . " Why do n't you make me dinner ? " Claudia showed up in a black dress and blue eye shadow . Her voice seemed oddly pitched , a bit too exuberant . She gulped at her wine and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which looked polished . I did n't have much to say . Nor did she . We were just waiting around for the alcohol to spring our bodies . We moved to the couch , where we leaned and leaned and finally fell against one another sloppily . I slid my chin down her belly . She was so much smaller than Jo , almost delicate , but when her knees slipped behind my head they clamped me so hard my bottom row of teeth bit into the underside of my tongue . I could taste my own blood and this mixed with the slightly acrid taste of her . Gradually , her legs sagged to the bed . Her pelvis vaulted into the air . I followed her up , pressed harder , and suddenly there was a warm liquid coming out of her , a great gout of something sheeting across my cheeks , down my chin , splashing onto the comforter . I figured , at first , she had urinated . But there was simply too much fluid coming out of her . By the time Claudia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , the puddle on my comforter was two feet across . " Are you okay ? " I said . Claudia nodded bashfully and stumbled to the bathroom . My second theory was that , as a lifeguard , pool water had somehow accumulated inside her and been released when her internal muscles relaxed . But the liquid was as tasteless and odorless as rain . And you know what ? I was goddamn thrilled . It was such a freakish thing she 'd done . Claudia , this quiet little mermaid , with her spectacles and her lisp , with her dull brown eyes , who never so much as touched herself so far as I could tell , had not only surrendered her body to me but expelled , spumed , ejaculated some mysterious orgasmic juice all over my face . I felt like doing a victory lap around the puddle . * * * Jo felt my basement apartment was , as she put it , " the kind of place where a serial killer lives . " She needed sun , she explained . And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a brick building in Sunset Heights , El Paso 's historical district . The neighborhood sat on a small rise overlooking the Rio . Locals once had watched Pancho Villa 's forces battle federales on the plains below . The view now was of the colonias , the sprawling cardboard cities that enveloped Jurez proper . Our apartment was bright and dusty . Every day a new piece of furniture appeared , or a houseplant . Jo made forays into Jurez , carrying back masks , wall hangings , a black leather whip I hoped to employ in some splendidly incompetent sex game but which was instead suspended tastefully over the divan . The kitchen began to fill with utensilsnot just forks and spoons , but garlic presses and salad spinners . With a great , perhaps even vicious , efficiency , Jo erased the vestiges of my bachelordom . Closets became places where clothing was hung . I arrived home one day to find the bed decked out in new colors . Jo wandered in from the other room . " What do you think ? " " Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I knew you 'd like it . " She hugged me . " It 's " You gave it away ? " Jo slipped her hand into one of my back pockets and gave me a playful squeeze . " Do n't you like this one ? We can give it a test-drive if you 're not sure . " " Yeah . No . It 's nice . I just do n't understand why you needed to throw the old one out . " " I did n't throw it out , David . I gave it to charity . It had a stain . " Jo began unbuttoning my shirt . " What stain ? " " A huge disgusting stain . Right in the middle . " I felt a fizz in my chest . " Whatever happened to washing ? " I murmured . " If you loved the thing so much , " Jo said , " you should have washed it yourself . " Mostly , though , we had this beautiful new life . We went to a lot of parties . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico and stopped in obscure towns for pie . We slept in on Sundays . Sometimes , late afternoon , we would lie in the hammock strung across our balcony and watch thunderheads lip over the Franklins , releasing spindles of lightning . Everything changed when the rains came : the desert turned a rich brown and threw up the mulchy scent of creosote . Boys fluttered like salmon in the flooded gutters below . The slag heaps behind the smelter gave off the dull wet sheen of solder . Over in the colonias , mamas filed out of shanties to wash their children and fill metal drums with drinking water and thank the Lord . Afterwards we listened to the world trickle and waited for the honeyed colors of dusk . With the sky suddenly cleared of smog , we could see all the way to the sierras south of Jurez , which looked like giant bones against the thirsty soil . I took Jo to see Mtley Cre . Probably it would have been better to start her off on Poison , one of the ballad bands . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wore a suit of studded black leather , elevator shoes , a choker . " He 's kidding , " Jo shouted . " It 's a joke , right ? " Neil leapt onto a speaker . " How many of you guys are gon na get some fucking poooontang tonight ? " The crowd went apeshit . The bass started in , along with the drums ; the plastic seats began to quiver . Then a noise like wheels hitting a runway , which meant the guitars , churning down to their appointed chords . Jo looked as if she 'd been struck in the back of the head with an eel . I 'd given her a pair of earplugs , but the affect of 105 decibels is as much seismic as auditory . Strobe lights popped . Neil howled . His voice was a rapture of violent want , released to the crowd and returned in ululating waves . All around us , skinny boys emptied their bodies of sound . Everything about them banged . Bang bang bang . Their hair whipped the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jo on the steps outside the arena , head between her knees . " If they could just turn it down a little , " she said . " Go ahead and take the car , " I said . " I 'll catch a ride from the night editor . " I figured Jo would be asleep when I got home . But she was sitting up in bed , a towel wrapped around her head . " Feeling better ? " I said . " Yeah . How was the rest of the show ? " " No big deal . Nikki Sixx flashed the crowd his weenie , so that was pretty cool . " Jo took a sip of tea and fixed me with one of her concerned looks . " You do n't really like that stuff , " she said . I had hoped this might be one of those times where we let our differences be . " You sort of have to get into the spirit of the thing , " I said . " What spirit would that be ? The spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do n't like it . You 're just being ironic . " " Okay , " I said . " I 'm going to go brush my ironic teeth . " " And that singer guy , " Jo said . " What a getup . He looked like a piece of bad furniture . What 's he supposed to be , some kind of stud ? Some kind of big ladies ' man ? " " It 's a show , " I said . " Showmanship . " " What gets me is that kids are paying money to listen to that crap . It 's so indulgent . In a place like this , with so much real suffering . " " You should n't take it so seriously . " Jo waited a beat . " You do , " she said . " You spend half your life interviewing these guys and critiquing their shows . " ( Continues ... )
