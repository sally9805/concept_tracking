Chapter 16 : Worries " Mama ! I saw that old owl out in the pine tree the one we 've been hearing all this time . He swooped down on me like I was mouse-meat . " " That 's funny . The owls used to do that to your daddy . I think it 's kind of a joke . " " Not for the mouse . " " I guess every kind of creature has its own ways , " said Mama . " Jack used to tell me that owls knew a lot they were n't saying . " " I wish Willie would try to say things . What if he just turns totally pig , inside as well as outside ? " " Surely we 'll figure out something before then . " " We 've got to work fast , Mama . The Labor Day picnic is coming up soon , and Tom and Tod both want to barbecue Willie . If we manage to keep him safe past that , school starts and those truant officers will come up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Tod Watkins , plus they have all these reports to fill out and turn in and then who knows who-all will come sniffing around here looking for Willie . They 're getting real strict about school , and Willie never missed any . " " One day at a time , Louise . In hard times you have to take one day at a time in good times , too , come to think of it . " Delilah trotted into the kitchen , found the bucket empty , and began banging it against the stove . " Delilah , do n't bang the bucket . Say ' milk . ' MILK , MILK . ' " Delilah looked at Louise and banged the bucket . Mama put her hands over her ears . " She hears the shoats squealing . You better go milk Molly Cow , Louise , it 's late . We have to feed all these creatures . " Louise managed to take the bucket away from Delilah , who followed her out to the barn , lay down in the hay while Louise milked Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trotted around in anxious circles while Mama and Louise fed the shoats . The owl did not dive down again but stayed silent in the trees with his eyes closed . Mama hummed the mockingbird lullaby again . " You know , Mama , those things in the song are all around us . We do n't need anybody to buy them for us . We already have mockingbirds , and a pond we can see ourselves in but wo n't ever break like a looking glass . I guess Molly Cow is as good as any old dog named Rover , or billy goat , or bull . " " Better she gives us so much milk . " " And who needs a diamond ring , anyway ? " asked Louise . " Well , sometimes I think it would n't hurt to have a little something to sell , just in case . " " As long as we 've all got each other , Mama , we do n't need any money . " " Well , two of us are kind of missing . " Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Willie looked pretty comfortable there , and she barely remembered her father enough to miss him . " I 'm just trying to count our blessings , Mama . We 've even got eleven little shoats ! " " So true , " said Mama . Whoo , said the owl . " Howl , " said Willie . " Owl , Willie , " said Louise . " Say ' owl , ' not ' howl . ' " " Howl , " said Willie . " Hopeless , " said Louise . " Anyway , we 've got Molly Cow and a Tolliver owl . It just about rhymes . " Whoo , click-click , said the owl . " Sounds like he 's trying to talk to us , Mama . " " All I hear is ' who . ' Maybe you can figure it out , Louise . Your daddy could have . You look so much like your daddy right now . His hair used to turn red in the sun like that , and dark at night . His eyes , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked green in the light and brown at night . Between day and night , with the sun going down like it is right now , he just glowed . Like that owl there . " Louise looked up at the owl . Its feathers had a light and dark pattern lit up by a ray from the setting sun . Louise watched the pattern fade as twilight slipped into darkness . Evening was Louise 's favorite time of day . But what did evening mean ? Did it mean making things even ? Evening things out ? Getting even ? Or just balancing day and night , evening odd things ? And did odd mean different , like even and odd numbers , or did odd mean strange , like the Tollivers ? How did you even odd things out ? That night she saw the owl in her dreams . It was not saying whoo-whoo but how-how . The owl had its head turned , so she could see only one eye , but the eye was a big circle that spun around . There was a star in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Louise had drawn in the dirt . With the circle spinning , sometimes Louise 's name was on top , sometimes at the bottom , but the same names stayed across from each other , connected by lines from Louise to Maybelle , Willie to Luke , Delilah to TomTod , Jack to Mama . With the circle spinning and the star pulsing , Louise started to get dizzy . The circle wheeled around and around , she sailed to the top , and she swooped to the bottom . It was hard to hang on , halfway between heaven and Earth , halfway between day and night . Her hands began to sweat and slip a little each time she swooped down . On a last fast turn at the bottom of the circle , Louise 's fingertips slipped off . Suddenly she was falling , falling , falling through several sunsets ablaze with red and yellow , falling down toward a mountain of rotten tomatoes .
