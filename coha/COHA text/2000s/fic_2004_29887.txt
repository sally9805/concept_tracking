The Scarlet Empress By Susan Grant Dorchester Publishing Susan Grant " Your Highness . The pilot has been located . " Prince Kyber , ruler of the Han Empire , lifted his gaze from the shapely woman soaking his feet in a bowl of hot water to meet the gaze of his chief of security . Nikolai Kabul appeared somewhat breathless . It was n't at all typical of the all-business , ascetic man he 'd known since they both were boys-a friendship between a child of royal blood and a street-wise commoner that had somehow survived the years . " Excellent , Niko . The news pleases me . I 'll read the full report tomorrow at the morning briefing . " A single sapphire on Nikolai 's fez glittered in the war room 's cold overhead light , but the man said nothing . " Your silence tells me that I did not give you the response you expected , Niko . " " I assumed you 'd be ... more surprised . " " I 'm simply glad the situation is over . " Nikolai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But of course , it displeased me greatly , losing a top fighter pilot in a midair collision caused by human error . And over the Himalayas , no less , making it difficult for search and recovery to do their job . Difficult but not impossible . It 's why I appear more relieved than surprised by this swift conclusion to the affair . Pass along my praise to the team for a job well done . And assoon as the pilot is healed , have him sent to me for a little career counseling . He is due for a change of vocation , perhaps as a street-sweep driver in Macao . Fighter craft are tools of defense , not play toys . " Speaking of play toys ... Kyber exchanged a smile with the pretty woman massaging his right hand and forearm with fragrant oils . She had a way with her fingers . Had he invited her to his chambers before ? He could n't recall . He pulled her down for a kiss . No , she did n't taste familiar , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of females warming his bed-and his dining table , swimming pool , and baths since Banzai had disappeared into the ether . Kyber set the woman back on her feet to find Nikolai watching him , his eyes ablaze . " What is it , Niko ? You appear fairly ready to explode . " " Not the downed YR-55 pilot . The one who has evaded us . You know of whom I speak . I can not say more until we are alone . " Banzai Maguire ! Prince Kyber heard a thud to his right , accompanied by a small whoosh of wind and tinkling jewelry . He realized that in his shock , he 'd thrown the manicurist to the floor . Grabbing the woman 's hand , he tugged her to her feet . " Are you certain ? " Quickly , he locked his jaw . He despised the anger in his tone as much as he did the hope . Banzai ... She 'd routed him , that one , knocked him out with a nerve stunner . And then she 'd disappeared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neck . Perhaps it was best that his memory was wiped clean of the encounter itself . All he remembered of that day was waking back in the palace with an aching head and double vision , surrounded by attentive servants and a very angry Nikolai . Rebels had gotten Banzai out of the kingdom , he 'd learned that much , but where she had gone after that , he did n't know . She 'd been missing ever since , but , thankfully , had n't shown up in the UCE . It would be a mistake , a deadly mistake , if she defied his advice and did so . " Off with you . " Kyber waved the servants away . Suddenly , the company of a female , any female , felt like a sliver under his skin . As soon as the servants were gone , Kyber turned his attention to his security chief . " So you found the wayward American . Where was our Banzai hiding ? " " No , Your Highness , the wingmate has been located . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman-legends from the past who seem to be infesting abandoned underwater caves , they 're a plague , I tell you . A plague ! " Nikolai started to say something and then stopped . " What , Niko ? You have never held back your opinion from me . Do n't start now . " The chief stiffened his back . " I thought you would have been more excited by the news . " " Why , so I can repeat what was an unpleasant experience ? Banzai took advantage of my generosity only to cast me aside with little more than a few hollow words of thanks . Prince Kyber of the mighty Han Dynasty , ruler of all Asia , does not offer favors for nothing , Nikolai . From Banzai , that is exactly what I received . " He spat out a curse . It was a weakness on his part , forming an attachment to Banzai Maguire . A foolish error . He never should have allowed himself to feel affection for her . One thing he could say , however , was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have some intelligence images I would like to show you in more secure quarters , my lord . Minister Hong will join us in the war room . " The security chief 's eyes tracked down to Kyber 's feet . " Will you be soaking much longer ? " That 's when Kyber realized he was standing in a shallow bowl of steaming water with rose petals whirling on top . With disgust , he splashed out of the bowl . " Why do the women always insist in dousing me with such delicate scents ? I am not a delicate man ! " He was taller and more ruggedly built than even his father and grandfather . His mother claimed he owed his build to his Scots genes ; his father , back in his lucid days , would argue that the Mongol Khans had provided the DNA in question . While Kyber considered Genghis a few too many generations removed to make an appreciable impact on his bloodline , he was certain that neither the clan chieftains nor the Mongol warriors in his family tree would approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bathing pool and dove in , eager to rinse off the perfume . The water was crisp and cool , and it braced him , erasing the last traces of mental dullness left from the plum wine the women had poured for him . Surfacing on the opposite side , he pushed on extended arms out of the water . Without slowing , he grabbed a fresh robe off a hook on the wall of mirrors , wrapping it around him as he walked up to a wall-and through it . It was an illusion made by a computer-trillions of them . Nikolai followed him into his private chambers , leaving the mirrored wall rippling like the Lake of Heaven near the palace he maintained in Paekdusan , far to the north . Kyber preferred his summer palace to this grander one in Beijing . There , he enjoyed the sharp scent of the forests and the seclusion of the mountains . Yet , Beijing was where the seat of the government conducted its business , and where his subjects expected him to be . Out of a royal obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long line of courageous ancestors that got him here , he found predictability translated to stability , necessary to ensure the future of the empire . It was why every autumn after Kingdom Day he dutifully returned home . Kyber burst into the war room , trailed by the security chief . The quartz , glass , and steel dcor , created to his specifications , suited the room 's use , lending it the cold , powerful , and masculine atmosphere he desired . Monitors covered the walls , giving views of international news as well as scenes from around the palace , inside and out , from the numerous security computers embedded in the structure . " Hong , " he said , acknowledging the ubiquitous presence of the Minister of Realm Affairs Horace Hong before turning to face his security chief . There were few in Kyber 's life that he trusted as implicitly as Nikolai Kabul . For God 's sake , he had his reasons for placing trust in so few . The emperor was almost murdered while eating breakfast , and every time Kyber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't ensure long lives for emperors . It was wisest not to give it at all . " We tore apart that cave searching for Scarlet , and yet we found nothing . Banzai doubted me when I told her there was no sign of her sister fighter pilot-not now or in the past . And yet , Scarlet has miraculously appeared-and under our very noses ! " " Not exactly . We found her in Mongolia . " " You 're joking . " " I wish I were . Intelligence imagery pinpoints her location in the village of Khujirt . " " Khujirt . " Kyber frowned , concentrating . " I know the place . It 's near the springs . " Old memories slid down behind his eyes , of a vacation to the region as a child . He 'd traveled there with his mother , a devotee of hot mineral springs . Kyber recalled his fascination with the remote and rugged scenery , taiga forest , the ibex and lynx he 'd viewed there , and particularly the ancestors of age-old nomadic tribes who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never forget the day he broke away from his bodyguards to chase after a shepherd near his own age , scampering beside him and his herd of stinking , flea-infested yaks through fields of wildflowers before being rounded up by the Empress 's angry staff . For a few hours , he had n't been the crown prince ; he 'd been a boy . " They 're farmers . Simple people . Impossible that they revived her . They do n't have the technology . " " Difficult , yes , but not impossible . This has contributed to her less-than-ideal condition . Our first observations showed her walking the paths in the area assisted by crutches . Apparently , she is now walking under her own power , or mostly . " " But in Mongolia . How did you learn of it ? " " Via a pair of Rim Riders . " " Good ! Find out their names . Put them in for a bonus . Better yet , send them to me so that I may praise them in person . Now , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of a woman new to the area-a badly injured woman . That she was blond , unusual for someplace so distant from an urban center , only intensified the curiosity . Rumors started and spread . Our Rim Riders overheard them , of course , and passed along the information to intelligence as part of a routine report . I saw the mention , thought it was best to investigate . We took satellite pictures over a period of several weeks . But only yesterday could I say I was certain of her identity . " " It 's her , Your Highness , " Minister Hong chimed in . " Her likeness matches the file photo we have . " Kyber had seen the same archived photo as the men . He summoned a mental image of Cameron Tucker . She shared little in common with Banzai , physically . In fact , the second pilot resembled more a hothouse flower than a warrior . All the more reason to stay well clear of her . Kyber opened a closet . Since his duties later that day would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in furs . Nikolai was dressed in the identical way , as were the rest of the soldiers and palace security . All that separated Kyber in appearance from his men was the platinum armband he wore around his upper right arm . The snake was a symbol of the Han dynasty . Other than that one small concession , of which he was proud , he abstained from the fanciful trappings of royal garb . He left that to his mother , Corrine , who loved to dress the part , going as far as outfitting Kyber 's father , daily , even as he lay in the far reaches of the palace with no more awareness than a vegetable . Kyber buckled his belt . " Why have we not known of the existence of the second pilot until now ? " " Outside involvement , " Nikolai guessed . " Someone took her before we could . " " Why were there no signs of tampering in the cave ? " " If the cryopod was hidden in one of the more heavily damaged areas , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue Banzai . In the gap between their departure and return , someone with the knowledge and motivation could have gone in-and gotten Scarlet out . " " And brought her to Mongolia ? Who dares to meddle so brazenly in realm affairs , Niko ? Tell me who they are ! " " They 're farmers- " Kyber gave an incredulous snort . " And I am Winston Churchill . " " All we know so far is that they 're indeed working on a communal farm . Collectives like these are quite common in the area , as you know . This one is small . Approximately a dozen people living there as permanent residents , others coming and going . Besides farming , they maintain a local hot springs and a pay-as-you-go temple . " Kyber made a sound in his throat . " Paying for divine intervention . If money could buy God 's answers , I 'd be a God myself . " And his father would be conscious and alive , relations with his younger , half-brother D'ekkar would not be what they were now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed , not Tyler Armstrong 's . " So far , I have n't found any connections between them and the Shadow Runners-or any other rebel organization . " " Shadow Runners , " Kyber thought with a growl . The radicals with whom D'ekkar had became involved while in prison . They were anti-monarchy , **30;1024;TOOLONG , it seemed . Having never once stated clearly their objective-besides wanting to make trouble-the Shadow Runners had so far done little more than irritate him like a splinter not yet worked close enough to the surface of the skin to be plucked out . Yet , he was n't complacent enough to dismiss them . If they ever became better organized , the group could prove to be a problem . " I 'm relieved to hear rebels are n't openly behind this , Nikolai , but now that the woman is mostly healed , why has she remained in such a godforsaken place ? Is she hiding from me ? " He 'd meant it as a joke , but Nikolai replied , " Most likely , Your Highness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage creep back into his voice as his mood darkened . " Has Banzai woven lies of exploitation at my hands ? I treated her with the care befitting the cultural treasure she is , better than she apparently deserves . The only crime I 'm guilty of committing was not bedding the woman when it was clear she needed it . " " We have no evidence of any communication with Banzai . Tucker has been in Khujirt for some time . It is possible , though unlikely , that she was taken from the cave even before Armstrong discovered Banzai . " " Armstrong . " Kyber poured himself a hot coffee and inhaled the fragrant aroma . " I should have executed the man while I had the chance . A bad habit , I have , Niko , preferring to play with my prey before killing it , no different from the cats inhabiting the alleyways in the Quarter . " The disreputable Serpent Quarter , where he 'd like to be at the moment , disguised as his shadowy alter ego Kublai , enjoying a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Show them to me . " Nikolai slipped a computer from his thigh pocket and unrolled a thin screen . Kyber took the device , scrolling through the photos as he sipped coffee . The images were crisp and clear , though taken from a great distance . They were of a woman , tall and slender . A glimpse of blond hair under a hood in one , and there , a better view of her struggling with the crutches on a rutted trail . Another showed her trying to stand after a fall , her frustration and determination obvious . Raw willpower . A powerful feeling of solidarity filtered through him , and he could n't pull his attention from the image . He knew the torment that gripped her , because he 'd been there . He knew what it was like , driving on when all you wanted to do was lie down and wallow in self-pity . The bleak days after the almost-assassination of his father the king had been riddled with such struggles for him . He was n't sure if he 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's appearance in his life had been a welcome diversion from the day-to-day realities of royal life , but now she was gone . He 'd be smarter this time . No woman warrior from the past would be allowed into his life or-curse the very thought-his heart . " These last images were what decided it for me , " Nikolai said . " They were taken yesterday by one of our transport crews . Since they were over-flying the area , I thought why not get some close-ups ? " " Close-ups , indeed ... " Kyber paused at an image of Scarlet standing in the middle of a dirt road , her head thrown back , her face directed at the sky . Her hair had come loose from its braids . Floating in an ethereal cloud , the golden strands framed an expression of wonder that captivated him . So unselfconscious in her hope and unfettered joy was she that he had to pause to catch his breath . Women had spurred him to do many things over the years for the sake of happiness-his and theirs-but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thrust the device back at his security chief . " I do not want her near me . Making my life difficult . Distracting me ! I am , as you know , a very busy man . " He stalked to a screen depicting a wintry street below his bedroom balcony . A cheering crowd braved an unseasonably early onslaught of sleet , awaiting his morning appearance . They loved him his people , as they had loved his father before him . He ruled with a heavy hand , yes , but like little children his subjects appreciated knowing their limits . Within those limits , they had the highest level of education , the longest lifespan , and the lowest suicide rate in the world . " I have an empire to rule . " He touched a panel that allowed his image to appear on the giant screen above the street . The roar that followed rumbled through the speakers embedded in the walls . " And a people to inspire ! " He raised his hand and the cheering increased a thousand-fold . ( Continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
