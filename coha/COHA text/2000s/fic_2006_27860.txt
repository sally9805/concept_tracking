Killer Deal By Anderson , Sheryl J. St. Martin 's Minotaur Anderson , Sheryl J. " You need a dead body . A really cool dead body , " Cassady suggested . " Is that something I order on-line or do they have a department upstairs ? " I asked . Believe me , if there were a way to order up a stylish cadaver in Manhattan , Cassady Lynch would know . Networking is second nature to her and with her long legs , amazing figure , and cascading auburn curls , her life is overflowing with people eager to do her all sorts of favors . " I 'm fairly sure you have to special order those , " Tricia said . " Especially one that 's already been refrigerated . " My two best friends and I were spending our lunch hour shopping -- that 's why granola bars fit in desk drawers -- at the marvel that is the flagship ABC Home Store on Broadway . High heaven for shopping addicts , it is eight levels of treasures ranging from dainty little soaps to massive French country antiques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite books was about two kids who deliberately get locked in the Metropolitan Museum of Art overnight ; I used to dream about doing the same . Now I dream about being locked in ABC Home . With a platinum card . That someone else pays off . We were on the first floor , helping Cassady search for a new pair of earrings . A fellow intellectual properties lawyer at the public interest group where she works hadpersuaded her to attend some sort of scientific seminar that night . She was having second thoughts , but did n't want to leave her colleague hanging , so she 'd decided new baubles would amp up her excitement about going . Cassady frowned , gently enough to show displeasure but not deeply enough to start a crease . " At the risk of disparaging the mayor or the commissioner , there have been plenty of homicides in Manhattan this summer . I 'm sure several of them are unsolved and worthy of your talents . " Love and murder are my favorite topics as a journalist and as a person . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blinding focus , and the will to succeed , being in love and being homicidal are n't as far apart as one might think . Or hope . And the place where those two mind-sets intersect fascinates me most of all . But it 's a dangerous intersection , and this time around , it would prove to be an incredibly costly one . " Believe me , I 've tried , " I said . " Not to sound like a ghoul , but whenever I hear about an interesting case , I pitch it to my darling editor , but she keeps shooting me down . " " Maybe Eileen -- and/or Fate -- are suggesting you try a social crusade or a government scandal , " Tricia suggested , examining a lovely pair of freshwater pearl dangles . " A less macabre route to greater journalistic glory . " As opposed to the murder route I had been pursuing . While I 'm best known as the advice columnist for Zeitgeist magazine , I 've recently -- through sets of unique circumstances -- had the opportunity to solve two murders . I wrote articles about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite launch the career transformation I 'd hoped for . My editor continues to scoff at my desire to formally move beyond " You Can Tell Me " and build up an investigative resume . And while I love my column and the front-row seat it gives me at the demolition derby of love , a girl needs a challenge . " Molly 's got a gift , Tricia , " Cassady said firmly . " We should encourage it . " " I want to see her byline in The New York Times as much as you do , " Tricia agreed . " I was just hoping there was a less dangerous way to get her there . " " I do n't want to work for The Times , " I told them . " Of course you do . Everyone wants to be on The Times . I do n't write and I want to be on The Times . You 're pretending otherwise because Crew Boy is there . " Cassady shook her head in disbelief . " Wimp . " " Not wanting to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me smart . " " Oh , bumper harvest of sour grapes . It 's a mammoth paper with plenty of room to avoid him . Or better yet , get him fired in as messy and public a way as possible . " Peter Mulcahey is a present rival and a former boyfriend . I was dating him -- actually , in the process of breaking up with him -- when I got involved with the first murder . And the detective investigating it . That dear detective is the one who christened Peter " Crew Boy . " Behind his back , of course . But it does suit him . At that point , Peter and I were both working at magazines we saw as jumping-off points for our writing careers . I 'm still at mine ; he 's jumped off to The Times , more through tenacious brownnosing than proven journalistic merit . Okay , Cassady 's right ; sour grapes abound but still : " I do n't wish Peter ill , " I said , trying to make amends . " Really ? " Cassady asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated the man . " " He did n't treat you well , Molly . It 's our right to wish for anvils to fall on his head , " Tricia said . " I just want to figure out the next step in my career , " I said , not so much to be noble as to stop talking about Peter . " Wonderful . We 'll switch to anvils falling on Eileen , " Cassady suggested . Eileen Fitzsimmons is my editor at Zeitgeist . We 're one of those glossy Manhattan lifestyle magazines that will instruct you to " Be Proud of Who You Are , " teach you " Ten Bulletproof Ways to Seduce Him , " and share the need to " Get Off Your Butt to Get Your Butt Off , " all in the same issue and with no sense of irony . Eileen was brought in to " put some teeth into the thing , " according to The Publisher . At this point , the only place she 's sunk her sharp incisors is into the tender hearts of the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best I can tell , she enjoys both reactions equally . Eileen has been good to me . Once . Which makes me nervous , since it brings to mind Don Corleone : " Someday . . . I 'll call upon you to do a service for me . . . " Eileen 's goodness was publishing my second investigative article , the one about Tricia 's brother 's fiance being murdered at their engagement party . Perhaps you heard about it , maybe even read it . As part of Eileen 's periodic efforts to toughen up the magazine , she asked me to write about the murder and the part I played in unraveling it . I wrote a strong piece ( if I may say so ) , we got lots of great letters and e-mails about it , and I 've been asking Eileen to let me tackle another investigative feature ever since . But she just scrunches up her nose like I 'm a particularly mangy kitten , pats me on the shoulder , and sends me back to my column . " Which brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem attractive to Eileen , " I explained to Tricia and Cassady . " Hmmm . Eileen as necrophiliac . Had n't considered that before , " Cassady said . " Please . Like I do n't have enough trouble looking the woman in the eye as it is . " " Play your connections . Get the inside scoop from your scrumptious Sherlock , " Cassady suggested . Tricia answered before I could . " Cassady , no . You know how Kyle feels about our investigations . " Hearing Tricia refer to them as " our " investigations was delightful , because I certainly could n't have solved either murder without their assistance , insight , and support . And she was absolutely right about Kyle ; he 'd be appalled at the notion of my actively scouting for another murder investigation . He 's very protective -- of me and of his turf . He 'd prefer that the two not meet . And I can understand that , even if I do n't always agree with it . Kyle Edwards and I met at a crime scene . Kyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Manhattan 's finest . I was there because I 'd discovered the body . We got to know each other very well very quickly , in part because he suspected me of being the killer . I felt it might clarify the situation if I solved the murder to prove him wrong . Not exactly Cinderella , Prince Charming , and the glass slipper , but we 've made it work -- most of the time -- and are navigating the misunderstandings , drive-by shootings , and the other events that can complicate a romance between two people in our positions . " A man does n't always know what 's good for him . Just ask Samson , " Cassady replied . " Kyle would n't stand in my way if I got a great story , " I assured us all . " He 's just not going to encourage me in that direction . " " He 's happy with you as an unfulfilled advice columnist ? " " Happy with people not shooting at me . " " So when 's he moving in ? " I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of them . " That soon ? " Tricia asked . " I need to get back . " I leaned in to hug them both good-bye and was practically stiff-armed by Tricia , who glared at me mightily . Cassady arched one eyebrow , something she does effortlessly and eloquently . " Remind me to give you lessons in how to blow people off . " " Got ta go back to the office , " I insisted . " Like you 'd ever let Eileen put you on that short a leash , " at all . I 'm just trying not to be premature in making any announcements . " " Announcements ? " The wedding bells were ringing so loudly in Tricia 's head I could almost hear them in mine . Tricia is an events planner and derives immense satisfaction , as well as a nice living , from bringing order to other people 's lives . The fact that she has known me for so many years and has yet to impose any order on mine both inspires and frustrates her . Because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake of assuming that Tricia is delicate and , therefore , meek . She 's delicate all right -- the same way a spider 's web is . It 's also beautiful and surprisingly tenacious . " Slow down , cowgirl . He 's moving some stuff in this weekend , that 's all . No significant exchange of jewelry , no contracts of any sort , just . . . stuff . " " What kind of stuff ? " Cassady pressed . " You 're well past the toothbrush and one change of clothes point , right ? " " Not up to me . " Cassady and Tricia turned to each other , delighted by this tidbit . " You know what that means , " Cassady said to Tricia for my benefit . " It was his idea , " Tricia nodded . " Why do n't I go back to work and let you two carry on at your own pace ? " Tricia beamed . " We need to have a party . " " Great , " I said . " Your place ? Kyle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant your place , " Tricia said . " Oh , no , no party . This is n't an official declaration of any kind . Just a little step in the right direction . " " So , is he going to be there every night ? " Cassady asked , pulling me back to where I 'd been standing at the counter . I made a half-hearted attempt at resisting , in part because I really did need to get back to the office and in part because I was concerned they were going to ask me questions I did n't have answers for . Interestingly enough , my friends were n't looking to me for answers . They were supplying them themselves . " I doubt it . He works a lot of nights , " Tricia said to Cassady . " Because we ca n't exactly crash there whenever we want to if he 's going to be living there , " Cassady continued . " Good point . " " Not necessarily a point at all , " I interjected . " He 's not living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation for possibly living there at some point , but is not currently taking up primary residence . " " I thought I was the lawyer . " " You 've taught me well , Obi-Wan . " " Not well enough . If I were in your Blahniks , that boy would have been installed full-time months ago and possibly wearing an electronic ankle bracelet . " " You 've never been that possessive in your life . " " Never had a man that worthy of possessing . " I let the compliment hang in the air while Cassady purchased a stunning pair of Sarah Macfadden earrings , delicate interlocking hoops of hammered silver . I did n't mean to downplay the importance or the excitement of Kyle and me inching toward a more permanent relationship , but the fact of the matter was , I was nervous . I 'd never lived with a man before ; most of my relationships had imploded well before keys were even swapped . And I 'd never been so crazy about a guy that he could make me come unglued just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was terrifying . Giving my arm a squeeze , Tricia murmured , " I 'm so happy for you . " " How long do you suppose it 'll take me to mess it up ? " " Stop it , " she said briskly , miming tossing salt over her left shoulder to ward off the Devil . Cassady tucked her new purchase into her bag and steered us toward the door . " Much as I 'd like to stay and teach Miss Molly to have a little faith in herself , now I am the one who has to get back . If I 'm actually attending this Concerned Geeks Saving the World thing , I 've got motions to file before I go , and motions to file before I go . " " Somehow , Frost made it sound more attractive , " Tricia said wistfully as we all made our way back onto the street . Robert Frost could have made anything sound more attractive . Save , perhaps , Eileen . She 's one of those women who can stop you in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know her , you 'll never slow down in her vicinity again . Early in her tenure , I wondered if it was possible to structure my work hours so I 'd only be at the magazine when Eileen wasn't -- say , in the middle of the night . But then the rumors about her never going home , just sleeping in her coffin in her office , started , and I figured I had to get used to placing myself in her path on a regular basis . Especially because I 'd already seen her dismantle several careers with nicely crafted lies whispered in The Publisher 's ear and I did n't want to make it any easier on her to get me fired than I had to . Which is why my heart skipped a beat when Eileen 's office door flew open just as I was walking to my desk . She stepped out with one hand extended portentously , like the Ghost of Christmas Future . A diminutive specter , barely five feet tall minus her Chloe wedges and clothed in an Elie Tahari chiffon skirt and paneled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was looking for , " she said , curling the hand slowly to summon me . I resisted the temptation to look back over my shoulder , knowing that anyone who had been standing there was quivering under a desk by now . " Lucky me , " I said , wishing it were so . " We were just talking about you . " Eileen flicked at her spiky black bangs as though the conversation had been exhausting , then gestured vaguely at her office . From where I stood , I could n't tell whether it contained other writers , editors , or a death squad . I was n't in any hurry to step up and find out . The great thing about the bull pen in our office is that lives are played out in the open ; the lousy thing about the bull pen in our office is that sometimes the life played out is yours . The wall-less floor plan , with row on row of desks , makes it physically impossible to keep a secret or tell a lie . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , making coming to work much more entertaining for the rest of us . " What can I do for you , Eileen ? " " We need to talk about the Garth Henderson article . " I ran through a couple of appropriate responses in my head and chose the most polite one , since half the bull pen had stopped what they were doing to witness this exchange : " Excuse me ? " Until recently , Garth Henderson had been a self-proclaimed " advertising rock star " known for his bold flair in both his campaigns and his social life . Then , three weeks ago , Garth Henderson became a corpse , having been murdered in one of the fancier rooms of the Carlyle Hotel . Specifically , he 'd been shot once in the crotch and once in the head . In that order , apparently . No arrests had been made , but the police had spent quite a lot of time talking to his ex-wife Gwen Lincoln and to Ronnie Willis , whose advertising agency , Willis Worldwide , was poised to merge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was tremendous pressure on the police -- primarily from Garth 's many influential friends -- to make something happen soon and I was glad for Kyle 's sake that he had n't caught the case .
