The Year of Pleasures By Elizabeth Berg Random House Elizabeth Berg I had been right to want to drive to the Midwest , taking only the back roads . Every time my husband , John , and I had taken a trip more than a few miles away , we 'd flown , and had endured the increasingly irritating airport protocols . I 'd finally begun to wear what amounted to pajamas so that I would n't have to all but strip before security guards who seemed either worrisomely bored or , equally worrisome , inflated with a mirthful self-importance . It was hard to believe that air travel had ever been considered glamorous , when now what most people felt was a seesawing between anxiety and exasperation . Well , folks , looks like our time has been pushed back again , the captain would say , and everyone would shake their heads and snap their newspapers and mutter to their neighbor . And if there was unexpected turbulence , a quivering silence fell . Now , on this road trip , my mind seemed to uncrinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a disease it had not , until now , known it had . Rather than the back of an airline seat or endless , identical rest stops on the interstate , I saw farmhouses in the middle of protective stands of trees , silos reaching for the sky , barns faded to the soft red of tomato soup . The weather everywhere stayed stubbornly warm , and people seemed edgily gratefulwhat could this mean , sixty-degree weather in November ? I drove through one small town where old people sat on rockers on front porches and kids tore around corners on bikes and young mothers , jackets tied around their waists , proudly pushed babies in strollers . I passed white wooden churches , red brick schools , stores with names familiar only to the locals , and movie theaters offering a single choice . I saw cats stationed at living room windows , horses switching tails against clouds of gnats , cows in pastures grouped together like gossips . These scenes seemed imbued with a beauty richer than normal ; they seemed so perfect as to have been staged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum full of pastoral bas-reliefs , and I took in the details that way , with wonder and appreciation . That was the tolerable part of my new vulnerability , the positive side of feeling my heart had migrated out of my body to hang on my chest like a necklace . There was an infinite variety of trees , and I felt ashamed to know the names of so few of them . John and I used to talk about how the current phase of the moon as well as the names of trees and flowers and birdsat least the local ones ! should be front and center in people 's brains ; maybe such a connection to nature would help to make us more civilized . But I was as guilty as anyone ; the only tree I knew beyond pines and willows and birches was the black locust , and that was because I liked the way John had described the blossoms ' scent : like grape lollipops . I passed massive-trunked trees standing powerful and alone , and imagined how in summer their leafy canopy would provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reedy saplings bending like ballerinas in the wind . Willow trees dipped their bare branches into pond water like girls testing the temperature with their toes . I felt a low and distinct kind of relaxation . Time became real . Nature became real : the woods , the sky , the lakes , the high bluffs and low valleys , the acres of spent fields , the muddy riverbanks . Live photos flashed before me : Here , a construction worker eating a sandwich , one foot up on the bumper of his truck . Here , a woman in curlers loading groceries into her car . Here , a child glimpsed through a kitchen window , standing on a stool to reach into a cupboard ; there , a beauty operator giving an old lady a perm . I saw in a way I never had before the beauty and diversity of our earnest labor on the earth , and also our ultimate separateness . This helped my pain metamorphose into something less personal and more universal , something organic and natural . And that helped give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be John . Nothing more . Nothing less . What fell to me now , what I was driving toward , was the creation of a new kind of life , minus the ongoing influence of what I had loved and depended upon most in the world . In a way , my situation reminded me of a little girl I 'd once seen exiting a roller coaster at a state fair , all wide eyes and pale face and shaky knees . When her brother asked if she 'd like to ride again , she said , Not until I 'm way readier . I felt myself trapped in line for a ride I was not nearly ready for , looking back but moving forward in the only direction I could go . Mile by mile , the country unfurled before mein bright morning light , throughout golden afternoons , under the pastel-colored skies of evenings . Once , just outside of Cleveland , when the sky was lavender and the clouds pink , I pulled to the side of the freeway to watch until darkness smudged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ; rushed up , then fell away . I became intimately aware of the lay of the land , felt the rise and fall of it in my stomach as I drove up and down steep hills . I deliberately pushed everything out of my head but what was before me . Still , every now and then a quick thrill raced up my spine in the form of a thought : I am my own again . Sorrow that lay pooled inside me gave over to a kind of exhilaration in those moments ; the relief was stunning . Though impermanent . One night , I checked into a motel at around ten o'clock . Next door , I heard a couple making love . Their sounds were sloppy and slightly hystericalDrunk , I thought . I turned the radio up loud , ran a bath , and while sitting at the edge of the tub unwrapping the absurdly little bar of soap , I felt the weight of my loss move slowly back into me . After I dried off , I sat before the television and marveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off , finally , then sat at the side of the bed and stared out at nothing . I picked up the telephone and dialed my home number . I heard the characteristic tones , then , The number you have reached has been disconnected . I hung up , closed my eyes , and took in a deep breath . Then I knelt at the side of the bed and pushed my face into my hands . Late in the afternoon of the third day , I pulled over to a frozen-yogurt stand near the center of a small town that looked particularly attractive to me . A tall , early-thirtyish man waited on me . He was beginning to bald already and had a distressing complexion . But his eyes , as though in compensation , were a brilliant blue . That 'll be a dollar sixty-five , he said , handing me the raspberry cone I 'd ordered . I pulled two dollars from my wallet and handed them to him , then took a lick of the yogurt . Delicious , I said , and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fussed with the register for a long while as I watched , first in mild annoyance , then in sympathy , finally in utter fascination . Eventually , the man turned and called to someone in the back room . Louise ? he said , apparently too softly , for then he called a bit louder , Louise ? WHAT ? she yelled back . The man straightened the paper hat on his head . Could you come out and help me ? he asked . Please ? Louise came out to the cash register , scowling . She was wearing a maroon sweat suit and was massively overweight . She wore her hair in a high ponytail . It was beautiful hair , thick and auburn-colored ; I concentrated on it while she concentrated on me . Finally , I looked at her face . Hello , I said . She jutted her chin at me . How you doing . There was mischief in her eyes . Was that you yelling back there ? I asked . She grinned . Yeah , that was me , whistling while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This goes on all the livelong day . Oh , well , I said . That 's all right . Easy for you to say . She turned to glare at the man , who studied his shoes . Then she fixed the register and stomped off . Okay ! the man said . Says here I owe you thirty-five cents ! He handed me the change . I thanked him , then , laughing , said , Though I think you could have figured that out on your own . He looked doubtful . Oh , come on , I said . Do n't you think we 're getting way too dependent on these damn machines ? Now he looked grateful . Id n't it ? I thanked him again and headed for the door . But I turned back before I opened it . Could you tell me what town this is ? He pointed to the floor . This here town where we 're at now ? Yes . He straightened , made himself taller . This is Stewart , Illinois , and I 'll tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I been here my whole life . It 's a good town , Stewart . Is this what you 're looking for ? I hesitated , then answered , Yes . As I started to open the door again , I heard him clear his throat and say , Miss ? I turned back . He was blushing , but with a kind of borrowed confidence , he said , Would you like to be on my radio show ? I tried hard not to let my astonishment show . You have a radio show ? Yes , ma'am , Talk of the Town . I get guests from town on , and we talk . That 's the show . I thought of the empty miles I 'd driven through to get to this town , the few places of business I 'd seen thus far . I did n't recall anything that looked like it might beor housea broadcasting studio . Where ? I asked . Right at WMRZ a few blocks over . It 's above the drugstore . I 've had Louise on my showwe talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it going ? Louise liked being on a lot , you can ask her . She got dressed up and everything , got herself a new purse for that show . He lowered his voice and leaned over the counter to say , Louise is the one sponsors me . Her bite is way worse than her bark , if you know what I mean . I hesitated , then refrained from correcting him . Instead , I said , Yes , I know exactly what you mean . So do you want to be on ? I tape every Sunday morning . Six-thirty . You 'd have to get up early , but you 're going to church , anyways , just get ready sooner . Well , I . . . You do n't need to answer now , the man said . If you want to do it , just come back and see me here . Or you can call me . My name 's Ed Selwin . My number 's in the book . It 's spelled exactly more or less like it sounds . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 's moving here , it 'd be good to interview you . You being a new person and all . But I . . . did I say I was moving here ? Not exactly . I just saw your loaded-up car with out-of-state plates , and then you said this is the town you were looking for . . . I see . And since you 'd be a new person here , it 'd be interesting to see where you came from and such . Like that . And do n't worrypeople get nervous being on the radio , just a natural thing , but I 'll settle you right down . Okay , well . . . I 'll let you know . I waved goodbye and began licking the quickly melting yogurt . Inside the car , I started the engine , turned on the heatthe weather had finally become seasonally appropriateand finished eating . I had an odd but familiar feeling inside , a kind of surety without grounding . It was something I often felt as a child , and it drove me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I should say , Yes , here , this is the place , just like that , and then go in search of somewhere to live . Why not ? What had I to lose , really ? I was in the middle of the country , as I 'd wanted to be . It looked to be a charming little town . And anyway , I would n't mind moving back toward a certain boldness of spirit , a reliance on a kind of luck I 'd always enjoyed . I remembered a story I once heard about a couple from a farm in Iowa looking for a place to live in Washington , D.C. They were n't having any success ; everything was incredibly expensive , and to make matters worse , they had three dogs . They became greatly discouraged , and then one day the woman threw up her hands and said , All right . Let 's just drive ten minutes one way and then turn left . And then drive ten minutes more and turn right . And then ten minutes straight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . What they drove to was a huge farmhouse just outside the city , and a man was standing outside of it . Feeling more than a little foolish , the couple asked if the man happened to know of anything around for rent . Turned out he had a little house on his property he used for hired hands that was newly vacated . Freshly painted . They could have it for next to nothing if they 'd help a bit with chores . And three dogs ? No problem . John once said , Sometimes serendipity is just intention , unmasked . I think I answered him with some sort of vague Mmm-hmm , right , hidden as I was behind the Globe 's book review . But I 'd always remembered it . And now I thought I knew what he 'd meant . When you were willing to say what you really wanted , something just might help you along . From the Hardcover edition .
