Section : Issues and Events With some international guidance , African and Middle Eastern scientists are learning how to influence government policy . <p> Scientists from around the world are working to establish national science academies in developing countries . They hope to advance scientific excellence , stop talent from leaving their home countries , and help solve global and regional crises . " Science academies can provide leadership in the development and application of science and technology , both within individual countries and internationally , " says Michael Clegg , foreign secretary at the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) in Washington , DC . But , he adds , major challenges lie ahead , such as maximizing science academies ' effectiveness . Some scientists argue that science academies can only be effective if they are independent from government control , whereas others claim the opposite . <p> No one , however , disputes that scientists should have a voice in influencing government policy . Says Alexander Animalu , past president of the Nigerian Academy of Science and chairman of the Institute for Basic Research in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt , high rate of inflation , mass unemployment , fuel crisis , collapse of the health and educational sectors , deterioration of the infrastructure of roads , epileptic electric power supply , religious riots , ethnic militia , and insecurity of life and property , the only hope of tackling this myriad of problems is by focusing on science- and technology-driven socio-economic initiatives . " <p> Leading the new academy-building movement are the InterAcademy Panel on international issues  --  a global network of 90 science academies  --  and the Third World Academy of Sciences , an international science academy representing more than 600 scientists , largely from the developing world . In the past two years , IAP and T WAS have held major workshops on dealing with Africa , on Latin America and the Caribbean , and on predominantly Muslim countries to promote the development and expansion of science academies . Individual academies also host similarly themed workshops . For example , the NAS recently held a workshop for African science academies on the role of science in policymaking . Motivating scientists <p> The goal of the academy-building movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T WAS Executive Director Mohamed Hassan . " We felt that the young scientists in developing countries are not getting enough recognition .... If you have a very strong national academy of science , young scientists would want to join it . This would help promote scientific excellence in their country . " Academies are ideal for promoting international links through exchange programs , says Lee Yee-Cheong , vice president of the Academy of Sciences Malaysia ( ASM ) . In turn , he adds , these links increase the visibility and profile of researchers from developing countries and reduce their professional isolation and the likelihood that those researchers will choose to work abroad permanently . <p> The first results of the workshops can already be seen . African science academies have made progress in using merit-based approaches to elect academy members , and some academies have made a particular effort to engage women and interdisciplinary scientists . A March workshop in Trieste , Italy , on academy-building in Muslim countries has led to feasibility studies for new science academies in Saudi Arabia , Tunisia , and Sudan . <p> Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective national science academies , says Karim Ahmed , director of the international program of the National Council for Science and the Environment in Washington , DC . He points out four reasons why : Political and businesss leaders do not understand the benefits , the knowledge of how to run such an institution is not available locally , resources are scarce , and apathy tends to be high among the region 's scientists and engineers . An additional problem is that many scientists leave to work abroad , says Ahmed . " You must have a minimum core of 20 to 30 internationally recognized scientists to set up a national academy , " adds Hassan . " Otherwise it does n't work . " A good role model ? <p> Once set up , how influential are the new academies ? " I am not convinced that academies ipso facto do help improve the science base , " says Yee-Cheong of the ASM . A successful academy , he adds , must have a mandate , money , manpower , the active participation of its members , and sound advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on government funding because few grant-giving foundations exist and dues from members are small . Yee-Cheong suggests that academies lacking direct government involvement are not good role models for developing countries because they typically attempt to influence policymakers through the media , a less effective approach than through direct connections with government officials . " There is little point in an academy offering any advice if you know in advance that the advice will not be considered , " says Yee-Cheong . " Establishing constructive relationships with government and funding are key challenges , " agrees Clara Cohen , NAS program officer for international affairs . Yee-Cheong says academies should adapt to the local social , political , and cultural ethos and , above all , serve national development needs . New academies that emulate Western values of independence and transparency " are languishing , " he adds . <p> Academies in India and China " are doing a terrific job " in specific areas such as information technology and climate change research , and Brazil and Chile are well-regarded models for the rest of Latin America , says Hassan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to high-ranking positions within the science academies , creating scientific reports that influence government policy , and focusing on specific research areas . Among predominantly Muslim countries , Hassan adds , Malaysia 's academy , which is only seven years old , is highly respected . It is successful and influential in part because the country 's chief science adviser is also the academy president . Similar academy  --  government links may be helpful to new academies because , as Yee-Cheong points out , " governments in developing countries are generally very sensitive about being advised . " <p> How influential are academies at translating research into public policy analysis ? When African delegates attended a recent workshop , " in many cases it was the first time the science minister and the president of their country 's science academy had met , " says Hassan . In the US , the NAS is very effective , but in Africa , he adds , " many academies we already have are not fully engaged in public policy issues . " Hassan cites the AIDS epidemic as an example : Few governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or academies , he says . " For this reason , part of our program has been to assist in developing their public policy capabilities . " <p> " There are notable exceptions , such as Ghana , where scientists have long had a role in government , " says Irving Lerch , director of international affairs at the American Physical Society . But , he adds , most countries have focused on obtaining advice or resources from specialized United Nations agencies instead of developing local institutions to provide local solutions . To help develop long-term sustainable support , the NAS has started a 10-year program to conduct joint policy advisory studies with African academies of science . Each study will focus on a critical issue facing the nation involved . " There are many good African scientists out there who are strongly committed to the improvement of their own societies , " says NAS 's Clegg . With support , he adds , they can have a major impact . <p> New academies might be valuable to more than just developing countries . For the US to " have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world lives is a threat  --  both to the US and to the rest of the world , " says NAS President Bruce Alberts . " As a start , it is critical that we find a way for a large proportion of our nation 's young scientists to engage with their colleagues in developing nations .
