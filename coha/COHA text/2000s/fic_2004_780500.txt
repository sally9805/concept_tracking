ROAD - NIGHT Two lights in the far distance penetrate the rain as they hover closer . A rickety white van crawls up a makeshift muddy road to the security gate . With recognition the guard in the booth waves the driver in as the gates slide open . The storm engulfs the asylum in the distance . The massive building rests between three guard towers each throwing searchlights across the compound . A rusty sign , embedded into the dark stone wall , indicating Arkham Asylum . EXT . ARKHAM ASYLUM - CONTINUOUS The headlights cast light on the stone steps leading to the former mansion . The van squeals to a stop and two muscular guards step out , sinking into the mud and pounded by the storm . They both wade to the rear and while one fumbles for the keys , the other readies his cattle prod . The back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient who flies face first into the mud . The patient raises his head gasping for a breath but is met with a thick boot forcing his face back into the mud . The other two roughly force his body into a straight jacket . The guards jerk him onto his feet . A large yellow smile is all that is visible through the black mud covering his face and hair . He lets out a familiar high pitched laugh . INT . ARKHAM ASYLUM Through the entry way , down the stairs , and past the double gates is a long row of cells . Water drips from the ceiling onto the stone floor creating silver puddles scattered down the hall . Screams , moans , and incomprehensible yelling fill the chamber . The squealing of the rusty cart attracts the attention of the patients . A doctor and an orderly both in white coats saunter down the row looking straight ahead , deliberately ignoring the patients in each cell . Arms hang out the first cell they pass , a crazed man lunges for the doctor , narrowly missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the floor is covered with snow . # DOCTOR # What is his status ? The orderly avoids the grasp of a quick hand . # ORDERLY # Wo n't eat , wo n't talk , wo n't let anyone close enough to test him . The men stop at the final cell and look in through the tiny glass window . INT . CELL Pitch black . A flash of lightning through the barred windows briefly reveals the contents of the cell . A large man is curled up in the corner . His face covered in a tight red mask and his body is bound by a straight jacket . ORDERLY ( V.O. ) ( CONT 'D ) He stopped screaming last night , I guess the hallucinations have stopped , now he just growls , like he 's part animal or something . # DOCTOR # Or something . EXT . CELL # DOCTOR # I will examine him now , sedate the patient . # ORDERLY # He 's too weak to try anything . The doctor shoots the orderly a commanding glance , who takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient with his baton . INT . CELL The door creaks open letting a crack of light onto the patient huddled in the corner . He continues to rock back and forth oblivious to the men entering . The two orderlies enter first . One orderly cautiously steps over and pulls him to his feet . The patient 's head sags to his chest . The other orderly prepares a needle from the cart . ORDERLY ( CONT 'D ) Take it easy big guy , you wo n't even feel it . The orderly quickly inserts the needle into the patient 's needle scarred wrist and injects the amber liquid . The doctor follows in , slamming the door home behind , and stands face to face with the patient . # DOCTOR # I am told we are feeling better today . The patient just mumbles to himself , still seemingly unaware of his surroundings . The doctor steps closer to the patient , whispering in his ear . DOCTOR ( CONT 'D ) You 'll never leave here , not after what you 've done to Gotham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grunts . DOCTOR ( CONT 'D ) If you do n't cooperate , we 'd be happy to change your accommodations . A thirty day stretch in the rubber room may be the perfect treatment . The patient mumbles angrily . DOCTOR ( CONT 'D ) Another month it is . ( BEAT ) Throw him in with our newest guest . The doctor starts to leave , but as he turns he notices the patient 's arm is a dark purple . He then notices a tourniquet around his elbow , he glances up at the man , who flashes a menacing smile . Supporting himself on the orderlies he kicks off the doctor 's chest , and while kicking him across the face he back flips out of the grasp of the orderlies and continues the flip sliding down between the two bringing them crashing to the floor . He sweeps the cart scattering the needles through the air . With remarkable speed the patient is on his feet catching three of the needles in a flash of the hand , darting a needle into each man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injects himself in the wrist , then removes the tourniquet . A small mirror towards the bottom of the cell gives view to the clock at the end of the hall . It reads : 11:59:57 .. 58 .. 59 .. 12:00:00 . He snaps the rubber tubing attached to the top and bottom door locks . A spoon jams between each lock and he slides the door open . EXT . CELL The patient sprints down the length of the hall towards the guard booth . INT . GUARD BOOTH The guard looks up from his magazine and sees the masked man charging him . He stands , hits the alarm , and grabs the shotgun . As he turns the man is already flying through the window head first and tackling him . Within a second the patient disables the guard , grabs his keys , and unlocks the closet . The loud wailing of the alarm hastens his pace . He unlocks and opens an electrical box revealing rows of marked switches . He flips the row marked " Electric GTS Perimeter " . He pulls a lever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ASYLUM ENTRY The man lugs up the stairs and into the entry way . Several armed guards led by Head of Security LYLE BOLTON , an intimidating man in his forties , file out from the second floor . # LYLE # Take out this legs . The guards unleash of flurry of bullets . The man rolls out of the way of the fire and bursts out the front doors into the raging storm . EXT . ASYLUM The scream of the alarm echoes through the compound . He stumbles a bit still bewildered from the injections , he hurls his body across the stairs and lands in front of the van . The guards burst out of the asylum and rush the patient . A helicopter appears overhead with its searchlight centered directly on him . He searches through the blinding light for the source of the voice : LYLE ( CONT 'D ) Drop to the ground or you will be killed . He turns to run , but the light blinds his direction . LYLE ( CONT 'D ) You try it , your dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered and drops into the mud . LYLE ( CONT 'D ) Put your hands behind your head . Again , the patient does as ordered bringing his muddy hands to his neck . Lyle rushes the patient and slams the butt of his rifle into his stomach . He then proceeds to kick him relentlessly . A low hum is barely audible above the roaring of the rain and thunder . As the man is being beat the hum comes closer , closer , until it is a loud shriek . Lyle stops the beating to look around for the source of the sound . He looks down at the ground and in the searchlight is a large shadow ... in the shape of a bat . Lyle looks up to see the Batwing hovering five feet above . Taking advantage of the distraction , the man hits Lyle with both fists in his thigh , throwing his prosthetic leg . Lyle falls and the patient catches him over his shoulder . # GUARD # Hold your fire ! He 's got Lyle . The patient sprints across the courtyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EXT . PERIMETER FENCE The patient runs straight at the closed gate and then hurls Lyle onto the barb wire . He screams out in pain , uselessly fighting to escape the razor wire , kicking away with his one leg . The patient jumps over the fence , using Lyle 's body to avoid the barb wire , falling to safety on the other side . Three military trucks speed across the compound and through the perimeter gate , one stops next to Lyle to pick him up . The helicopter follows above keeping the searchlight on the escapee . INT . TRUCK Lyle hops into the passenger side and the driver hands him his leg . Lyle snatches the leg from him angrily . EXT . COMPOUND The trucks near the patient . One truck ramps up a pothole launching it into the air . Looking up the patient sees it flying over his head . The truck crashes down on its side , almost crushing the patient , and then slides past him . INT . TRUCK Lyle pulls the handset from the dash-radio . LYLE ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXT . TRUCKS The front truck accelerates as if to ram him . The patient glances back to see the bumper inches away . Suddenly he jumps over the unseen cliff and disappears into the abyss . The 3 vans hit the brakes and slide through the thick mud to the cliff 's edge . One van slides too far and teeters over the edge . INT . FALLING TRUCK The guards are motionless , terrified . The men are staring straight down into the dark canyon . INT . 2ND TRUCK # LYLE # Hold it steady boys , we 're coming for you . The driver hops out and runs to the winch on the truck 's front bumper . INT . FALLING TRUCK The men are frozen , with horrified looks staring down into the black abyss . The truck gives a little more , and begins a slow slide . EXT. 2ND TRUCK The driver unreels the winch quickly , it stops suddenly . He tugs it harder , jammed . INT . FALLING TRUCK A radiant light suddenly appears through the windshield . EXT . CLIFF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient pulls the red mask from his face revealing BRUCE WAYNE , looking tired and haggard after weeks of torment we can only imagine . He sits behind the pilot : ALFRED , an elderly butler in his seventies The truck falls . The Batwing fires two harpoons through the truck 's windshield , which continue through the back windows and towards the other trucks . The guard at the winch ducks as the spear narrowly impales his head , and punctures the grill . The other harpoon scores through the other truck 's windshield . The truck on the cliff is now supported by the weight of the other trucks . INT . BATWING # ALFRED # I hate to interrupt your vacation master Bruce , perhaps in the future you 'll choose a more hospitable location . He puts his hand on Alfred 's shoulder . # BRUCE # Let 's go home Alfred . EXT . BATWING The canopy closes . The Batwing tilts backwards and rockets straight up narrowly missing the helicopter . The guards stand in a circle staring up at the sky , the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The red glow of the Batwing exhaust disappears into the night . FADE OUT . INT . WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE 'S BEDROOM A fire blazes in the massive fireplace . Bruce stares out the massive window onto Gotham below . His eyes are black and his skin a pasty white . The litter surrounding the Christmas tree in the corner indicates he 's been here for days . Alfred enters with a trey of food . # ALFRED # Master Bruce , would you please eat at least one meal . Bruce does n't respond . Alfred proceeds to place the trey on the desk and then turn on the television . GRACE SUMMERS , an attractive redhead in her early thirties , is reporting . # GRACE # ... funeral . Gordon 's family was unable to comment but a statement was released by Gordon 's replacement : James Noose . # JAMES NOOSE # The murder of Commissioner Gordon will not go unpunished . We will find the man known as Batman and he will stand trial . He walks toward the door then turns back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may be so bold , I am your butler , but also your friend , if you feel the time is right , I would like to hear what happened . # BRUCE # Thank you Alfred . Alfred hesitates at the door , then turns and leaves . Bruce stares blankly at the TV , Grace Burn continues her report . BRUCE ( CONT 'D ) Gordon ... FADE TO : EXT . APARTMENT - STREET - NIGHT A crowd of people is being pushed back behind the police blockade . A police cruiser arrives . COMMISSIONER GORDON , an athletic man for his fifties , steps out of the car and looks up to the 30 story apartment . INT . HALLWAY - NIGHT Gordon makes his way from the stairs . Two children , one dressed as a princess , the other a fireman cry in their mother 's grasp . # MOTHER # It 's alright , we can still go trick or treating , we 'll still go . # GORDON # Excuse me . Gordon wedges by them and ducks under the police tape into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a police and detective squad busily works the crime scene . A quiet murmur fills the apartment . In the middle of all the flashing cameras and cop banter a man 's body lay face down on the floor . His head is literally smashed through the broken floor . Pumpkin shards are scattered across the scene , burn marks in the carpet . Gordon walks into the apartment like one who has done this time and time again . BULLOCK , a gruff donut eater in his thirties , jumps up from the body and waddles over to where Gordon is observing the scene . # BULLOCK # No ID on the victim yet , but the apartment belongs to a Dr. Susan Penchky and we 've got an APV for her arrest now . Gordon crouches next to the body noticing the head hanging down through the floor . BULLOCK ( CONT 'D ) Ouch eh ? Some real sick people man , they always come out on Halloween . # GORDON # Someone heard this , what did you turn up ? # BULLOCK # Neighbors down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . No eye witnesses . Bullock take a piece of gum from its wrapper and begins chewing it . Gordon shoots him a disappointed glance . # GORDON # Was that from his pocket ? # BULLOCK # Yea . # GORDON # Is it evidence ? Bullock sheepishly spits it back into the wrapper . Gordon strolls out the glass doors and looks up into the black sky . GORDON ( CONT 'D ) How 'd the killer get in ? Bullock just shrugs . Gordon walks back into the room as two officers block off the balcony doors with crime scene tape . GORDON ( CONT 'D ) Prints ? Weapon ? # BULLOCK # Nothing , it was a clean job , real professional like . # GORDON # There 's always something detective . Tell your men to take a break . # BULLOCK # Sir ? # GORDON # Go eat a donut detective . # BULLOCK # Alright boys , let 's give the scene some air , let 's go . The men file out of the room leaving Gordon alone staring down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BATMAN # No weapon was used , his head was stomped into the ground . Gordon swiftly turns but only sees a brief shadow . A blue ultraviolet light fills the room . BATMAN ( CONT 'D ) He was raised to the wall .... The light points to the indicated wall then darts around the room revealing various splotches and smears . BATMAN ( CONT 'D ) They drug him across the carpet here , based on the spreading of the blood , he was here awhile , they questioned him . The light reveals a myriad of footprints . BATMAN ( CONT 'D ) Look at the gait and stance depth , all five were very large men . # GORDON # I only see four sets . The light flies across the room and hovers on the victim , a fifth set of footprints on the victim 's back and neck . GORDON ( CONT 'D ) I see ... and how did they get in ? # BATMAN # Same way I did . Gordon pulls out his note pad and tries to keep up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand hitting the answering machine . MAN ON ANSWERING MACHINE Hey babe , it 's Jack , I 've got ta run back to the plaza for the tickets and I 'll be by at 11:00 , see you then . Gordon glances at his watch , 12:10. # GORDON # Those Jack-O-Lantern shards , we 'll send those to the labs see if we can lift a print or two . # BATMAN # Do n't bother . A gloved hand wipes across the coffee table . BATMAN ( CONT 'D ) Latex powder , they took the gloves off when the left . # GORDON # And I suppose you 've figured out the motive . # BATMAN # Wrong place , right time , they were n't after him , they needed the woman . # GORDON # Woman ? # BATMAN # The lipstick on his cheek . Gordon looks down at the head which ca n't be seen through the floor . He gives Batman a curious glance . BATMAN ( CONT 'D ) I was just downstairs . Gordon shrugs in appreciation . BATMAN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? # GORDON # Just keys and chewing gum . # BATMAN # Get your men to Gotham Plaza immediately , we may still have time to save her . Gordon squints into the darkness and sees that Batman is gone , the tape still untouched . EXT . GOTHAM PLAZA A large upper-class hotel . The street and sidewalks are vacant . Smoke billows from the entry of the hotel . The fiery faces of Jack-o ' - lanterns line the sidewalk . The Batmobile roars onto the scene , the hatch slides open . Batman slams to the ground with authority . Silence . Batman takes a few steps forward scanning the scene . He hears a man yelling and looks around for the source . Coins bounce off a nearby car . The screaming comes closer and closer and closer ... A bodybuilder slams onto the parked car 10 feet from Batman , caving in the roof . Batman stares in disbelief than walks towards the car as the bodybuilder , DEVIL , regains his senses and jumps to his feet , blood drips from the devil mask covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the top of a 5 story building where four other masked bodybuilders are about to jump . One of them swan dives towards the Batmobile . Batman speaks into his wrist/microphone. # BATMAN # Shields . In seconds the car shells over . TROLL slams into the car but it does n't give . He lays in pain a few seconds , then is electrocuted by the hood of the car , he rolls to the ground , smoking . The yelling of a jumping bodybuilder , ALIEN , alerts Batman into action . He grabs Devil from the car and points the grappling gun at his chest . Devil giggles . # DEVIL # Whoa boy , easy now . Batman fires the gun and a grappling hooks shoots through Devil 's coat and continues towards Alien . The hook grapples the helm of his pants . The rope catches over the top of a street light and jerks Devil off his feet as Alien slows down and stops 10 feet from the ground , creating a human balance . Two others jump . Batman checks his belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a grappling gun fires from the side of the Batmobile across the street towards Batman . In one swift motion Batman catches the gun , turns , and fires it up towards the falling men . The hook fires up and in between them . They look up as it sinks into the roof above , then look back down to see the other end of the rope coming up at them . At the last second the ball bursts open and a net spreads out capturing them both , suspending them a few feet above the street . The bodybuilders struggle free of the rope . They encircle Batman . DEVIL ( CONT 'D ) Do you mind if we kick your face in ? # BATMAN # Sure , and please , do n't wait your turns . Devil charges Batman head on . Batman sidesteps and trips Devil into another kick . Devil gets back up completely un phased and charges Batman again . Batman sidesteps tripping Devil through a store window . Troll pulls out a ball and chain and begins swinging above his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with incredible force , Batman rocks his head back and the momentum of the missed swing sends Troll twirling around . Batman grabs the spiked ball and swings Troll around , slamming him through a water truck . Batman turns just in time to see the other two men holding a small car above their heads , ready to throw . As he spins Batman sends two Batarangs flying , each hitting a bodybuilder in the face . They drop the car on their heads and hit the ground . Devil steps out of the gun store window firing a shotgun . Batman stands easy . The Batmobile releases a flock of twenty Batarangs narrowly flying past Batman and rip through Devil hurling him back into the store . Troll takes two water jugs from the water truck and charges Batman . Batman hits his stance , dodging the swinging water jugs . In a quick spin he lands a kick across Troll 's jaw sending him flying into the broken jugs . A line of police cruisers arrive at the perimeter with lights and sirens blazing . They form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon stands behind his car door with a megaphone . # GORDON # All of you get down on your knees and put your hands on your head . Without hesitation Devil charges Gordon . Gordon steps back but is pinned by another car . Before Devil can breach the police line a batarang wraps his legs and he slams face first into the pavement . Batman begins dragging Devil back with the rope , when Troll and Alien charge him . Batman charges straight at them then dives to the left , clotheslines them both with the rope . Before they can stand Batman ties both of they 're arms and legs . The remaining two body builders charge the police line . Gordon brings up his gun . GORDON ( CONT 'D ) Freeze ! We will fire . The bodybuilders only speed up , screaming their battle cry . Batman drops down in front of one of them with his cape off like a matador . He throws it over his face , and then wraps around him with the rope throwing him to the ground . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tranquilizer into his neck . Batman looks up to see the second bodybuilder be riddled with bullets . # BATMAN # NO ! DO N'T SHOOT ! His yelling inaudible over the gunfire . The bodybuilder slows but continues to charge , only to be shot several more times , he falls to his knees , than onto his face . Dead . Batman angrily stands lifting the 300 pound bodybuilder onto his feet . He walks over to the dead man and searches his pockets . He finds a two Plaza tickets and a matchbook with two addresses hand-written in the opening flap . # OFFICER # We are going to need that as evidence Batman . # BATMAN # Alright . Batman tosses the sedated bodybuilder onto the officer while ripping the cape off . Gordon approaches Batman . BATMAN ( CONT 'D ) No sign of her , they dropped her off before the checkpoint . # GORDON # Batman , my men , they had no choice- # BATMAN # There was no reason . Batman looks over at a pile of broken ropes , Troll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bullock turns away in anticipation of the blow , but looks back and he is gone . INT . BATCAVE The Batmobile rolls into place at the edge of the cave . Batman jumps out and walks up the stairs to the research area , Alfred awaits with a towel and dinner . # ALFRED # Early night sir ? Batman does n't respond , but walks into the closet . ALFRED ( CONT 'D ) Is something the matter sir ? Bruce walks out of the closet in a black tank top and pants . # BRUCE # No Alfred , we 're going to need access to the police computers , bring em up will ya ? Alfred nods and walks over to the main console , typing expertly . # ALFRED # Sir , we 're in , what is it you wanted to see ? # BRUCE # Three men were brought in tonight , I 'd like to see their profiles . Alfred types away like a veteran hacker . The information comes up with the mug shots . # ALFRED # No previous records . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I 'm afraid there is n't much here Master Bruce . # BRUCE # Bank accounts ... Alfred types away furiously . Bruce begins reading off the results . BRUCE ( CONT 'D ) Food , food , food , car payment , food ... # ALFRED # What is it your getting at sir ? # BRUCE # Those men , they were ... unnaturally fearless , feeling no pain . Bruce tosses the matchbook and flips it open . BRUCE ( CONT 'D ) This first address is Shenksy 's , look up this other address , I think it 's their next mark . # ALFRED # Mark sir ? # BRUCE # It wo n't stop tonight . Bruce walks to the edge of the platform and looks into the abyss of the canyons . INT . LECTURE HALL - DAY DR . JONATHAN CRANE , a tall lanky man in his thirties , paces back and forth lecturing to himself . # CRANE # I must not fear . Fear is the mind-killer . Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over me and through me . And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path . Where the fear has gone there will be nothing . Only I will remain ... # STUDENT # Dr. Crane , I do n't think anyone in this room knows what the hell you 're talking about . Crane stops suddenly and looks around , realizing he is in front of a full lecture hall . Crane pauses , than smiles . # CRANE # Very well Mr. Snow , what is your greatest fear ? # SNOW # Fear itself ? # CRANE # Nonsense Mr. Snow , if fear is inevitable , controllable , then why can it not be our ally as well ? Blank stares . CRANE ( CONT 'D ) Mr. Snow , I could talk all day about the extent of fear on the placement of society , how about I show you instead ? Crane walks behind the lab table and pulls out a large aquarium . Behind the glass is a large black cat . The class leans forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small white mouse . He holds the mouse by the tail and waves it in front of the glass . The cat begins to hiss and claw at the glass . CRANE ( CONT 'D ) Conflict is dictated by fear , nature , by definition , is the balance of that fear . The cat knows the mouse is afraid and therefore knows he 's in control , but what happens when ... Crane places a cover on the aquarium , and then turns the valve on a small canister connected to the cover . A red gas leaks into the aquarium , but the cat seems unaffected . Crane takes away the cover and picks up the mouse . Crane drops the mouse into the aquarium . The mouse immediately runs to the corner , and the cat drops low and prowls forward . Suddenly the mouse turns and squeals , the cat quickly retracts with its fur and back spiked and begins ramming into the glass on the opposite side desperate to escape . Crane reaches in to pull out the cat , but the cat sinks its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand and glares at the cat . Crane then takes a syringe and presses a small drop of amber liquid onto the mouse 's neck . The mouse pauses , then stands up on its legs , it hisses and charges the cat 's throat . After a minute of squealing and hissing the white mouse is soaked in red , and the cat is dead . Crane looks through the other side of the glass smiling widely . INT .

The group stares in disbelief . INT . LOCKER ROOM The bodybuilders walk into the shower room . Everyone taking a shower sees the group , grabs their towels , and runs out . The group begins pushing each other around and the usual locker room horseplay .

The screen shows the processing then displays the results . # BRUCE # ( reading the screen ) traces of hydroxyandrost , testosterone . A simple steroid ... Bruce walks up and looks closer at the screen . BRUCE ( CONT 'D ) This is n't possible , it 's unstable , it would kill the recipient immediately . Bruce types away , zooming onto the cell .

Various machinery gauges each vat making for a very sterile technological factory . A reactor is suspended from the ceiling , directly above the emergency water pool that runs to the river . The torch-light fills the pool , and then suddenly goes out . INT . POOL Batman slowly raises his head from the water , looking around carefully before leaping out of the pool and onto the deck .

Brock pulls out a cigarette and lights it , leaning on a " Highly Flammable " sign . They both laugh at the absurd gesture . Two more tankers pull in through the hole in the warehouse wall . Two bodybuilders jump out of each one and go through the same setup process , each pumping the hydrosestine from their own vats. # CHRIS # What is he going to do with this much ? # BROCK # Do n't know man , as long as we keep getting the juice , I do n't ask questions . # CHRIS # True true .

Batman is on top of one of the tipped tankers looking over Crown . # BROCK # Batman ! Batman freezes , Brock is directly behind him . Brock pumps the shotgun . BROCK ( CONT 'D ) Do not move . Ethan , Crown , Chris , get over here . They surround Batman with their guns aimed directly at him . BROCK ( CONT 'D ) I 'm sick of this guy man , I 'm gon na waste him right here and now .

Batman takes the opportunity and dives into the water . Another vat gives under the pressure and immediately reacts with the other chemicals . The entire surface of the water is engulfed in flames . Batman looks up in the water and sees the fire just feet above . He swims faster through the pool and into the river . EXT . RIVER The Batboat fires out of the river and races across the surface . INT . FACTORY The men slowly get to their feet and look around . # CHRIS # What 's that on your leg ?

CRANE ( CONT 'D ) Your a special one are n't you , nothing works on you . Crane is mixing various chemicals , the door slams open . All of the bodybuilders file into the lab , their hair is bleached . CRANE ( CONT 'D ) Glad you all had time to stop by a parlor , did you get it ? # BROCK # Well that depends on what you mean by ' get it ' .

Gordon shoots him a questioning glance and then leads him into one of the labs . INT . LAB Gordon gestures to a microscope and a monitor off to the side showing what the scope sees . Crane steps up tentatively and looks into the scope , quickly back at Gordon , then back into the scope . His odd behavior does not go unnoticed by Gordon . # GORDON # The office said that with your background in chemistry and psychiatry you might have something relevant to add about how it may effect the psyche . Crane looks up from the microscope . # CRANE # Where did you get this ? # GORDON # Sorry , privileged information . We think it might have been manufactured locally . Any idea where something of this sort could be made ? # CRANE # No , it was n't made around here , it um , probably was made , somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Crane looks under the bed and finds a basket with his pants . He pulls out a small inhaler . He walks to the door and puts the inhaler to the crack at the bottom . He sprays the gas into the hall .

Batman slams to the stone floor holding his ears . A dish of food slides under the crack of the door . He slurps up the sledge and slams the trey down . He pauses a moment , regaining himself , then goes to work on the dish , ripping off the sides and flattening the metal . The bottom of the plate makes a mirror . He jumps up to the barred window and uses the mirror to reflect the lightning flashes into Morse code . He wedges the mirror in between the bars and angled for a view of the clock down the hall . He takes the spoons and puts one by each lock . One on top , one on the bottom . The switch on the toilet is pulled out , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connects to a longer rubber pipe .

He looks in the mirror and sees the doctor and orderly coming to his cell , he hurriedly puts the straight jacket back on . They 're coming . INT . BATCAVE Bruce slowly descends the staircase into his lair . He looks even worse than he was at the funeral . He stands in the center of the cave , looking around at the computer equipment , weapons case , souvenirs , Batboat . He turns to the suit case and looks at his reflection in the glass . His reflection overlays the suit giving the illusion of Batman standing in front of him . # BRUCE # Was it worth it ?

He shoves the 8 foot computer console , it rocks , then he shoves it again until it breaks free and falls down into the abyss of the cave .

He sprints to the weapons case and rips it out of the ground and smashing the glass sending his array of weapons scattered across the floor . He runs to the costumes case and rips the Batman insignia off the chest of the suit . Bruce stops from fatigue , and falls to his knees . # BRUCE WAYNE # No more ...
