Stowaway August 1768 SUNDAY 7th TO FRIDAY 19th Plymouth With the help of Seamen Francis Haite , John Ramsay , and Samuel Evans , I have managed to keep my presence aboard Endeavour secret . She 's a small Bark , and her Company over eighty in number . It 's a wonder I 've not been discovered , with all the coming and going of the men aboard , but I have not . The three seamen I paid to get me on bring biscuit and water . They make certain I exercise each night during middle watch , when there are fewer hands on deck . But there is little to relieve my situation till Endeavour sails . It 's a good hiding place I 've got , in the aft of what Samuel Evans calls the Pinnace , a small boat Endeavour carries aboard her . I can look over the edge and see the deck without being noticed . But it is difficult , lying still , day and night . Sometimes the urge to cry out nearly gets the better of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who have helped me if I did . And I would be returned to the Butcher , who would take it out of my hide , if Father did n't kill me first . Endeavour creaks without rest as she sits at anchor . The breeze chatters her ropes against the masts . The ship 's bell clangs on the hour and half hour , and the bosun 's whistle ever pierces the air with its piped orders . With all the din of London , I thought it could never be so noisy on a ship . But it is . I 've chickens for neighbours , and pigs , and a goat . They snort and cluck and bleat day and night , in pens on deck . I 'm glad of their company and wish I might go near them more often . I 've had milk out of the goat , straight from her teat . John Ramsay says she 's aboard for the Gentlemen and Officers , so they might have fresh cream when they please . Today , the 19th , Captain Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Articles of War aloud . Captain is a clean-shaven man , strict and stern , with cold eyes . The Articles he read stated there would be no swearing of oaths on board , no drunkenness , nor uncleanness . Good thing Captain has n't had a whiff of me . The Articles declare cowardice , mutiny , and desertion to be punishable acts . They say naught of stowaways , but Francis Haite , John Ramsay , and Samuel Evans each glanced my way during Captain 's reading . SATURDAY 20th Plymouth Rain , rain , rain . Even with the cover pulled over me , I am thoroughly wet . SUNDAY 21st Plymouth We toss at anchor . My stomach heaves and cramps and heaves again . And I 'm bruised from head to toe . I half wish Father would come aboard and take me home . I 'm tired of being wet and hungry . Father knows by my letter that I 've run out on the Butcher . But I did not write where I meant to go , nor what I meant to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my plans myself . Even if he knew , he would not come . I am a disappointment to Father . All my brothers are scholars . Only I could not settle to my studies . Father has no use for a son who will not learn his Latin . MONDAY 22nd Plymouth A storm has made the sea sorely troubled beneath us , even as we sit at anchor . This noon a servant boy saw me heaving out of the Pinnace as he ran to be sick himself over the side . I pray he was too much in his own misery to take notice of me and mine . TUESDAY 23rd Plymouth Last night the servant boy came right to my hiding place . " Lad , " he whispered , " are you still alive in there ? " I held silent . After a moment he poked his head into the Pinnace and stared straight at me . I stared straight back . He looked to be fifteen or sixteen years of age . When he made out I was well , he smiled . Blisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel Evans called out from the forward of the ship , " Hey , there . You , boy . Get away from the Pinnace . " The servant boy was gone in an instant , but not before he 'd dropped some hardtack and a piece of junk into my hand . WEDNESDAY 24th TO THURSDAY 25th Plymouth More wind and rain , and the air thick and heavy on my chest . I stink worse than a London gutter . I wish I could just shut my eyes and sleep until everything was right again . I told Francis Haite about the servant boy who found me . " That would be John Charlton , " Francis Haite said . " He 's a good lad . He wo n't give you up . " Francis Haite is an old man , older than the Captain , with crooked and missing teeth and a face well lined . He clasped my shoulder for a moment . " Be patient , lad , " he said . I shall be patient . Father thinks me worthless when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . Well , I did run from Reverend Smythe 's school . And from the Butcher . But I had good cause on both counts . And unhappy as I am , cramped in the hard confines of the Pinnace , I am better off than I was with the Butcher . And so I shall remain , recording my trials in this journal . I shall prove to Father that I am not a quitter . That I am good for something . That I am more than a Butcher 's boy . Finally , the rain has stopped . Empty casks taken off . Fresh supplies of Beer and Water brought on . This afternoon , at last , we weighed anchor . Now there are new sounds to join with the others . The wind clapping the sails , the men singing out in the rigging , the water churned by Endeavour 's prow . Fine sounds . Sailing sounds . FRIDAY 26th Off the Coast of England Samuel Evans , who has the largest hands I have ever seen , larger even than the Butcher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the damp despite its wrappings . He can not read nor write and thinks it wondrous that a boy of eleven can do what a grown man can not . " I could teach you , " I told him . " When I am out of hiding . " He laughed and nodded his large head . " Time does sit heavy on a seaman some days . It 'd be a blessing to read away the hours . " SATURDAY 27th Off the Coast , North Atlantic Fair-haired John Ramsay , the youngest of the three men helping me , shipped out the first time when he was but eight . There are several Gentlemen aboard . I often hear the name of Mr. Banks called . He 's a very educated man from the sound of him . His brown hair goes wild in the wind , and his dark eyes are lit with an eager curiosity . Mr. Banks 's Company watched porpoises off the side this afternoon . From my hiding place I could hear their remarks and see the pleasure the Gentlemen took in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rail beside them and seen what they saw . As I write , the sea is ever in my ears and in my bones . Endeavour creaks and groans and sighs as she goes . I creak and groan and sigh , as well , but I must do it all in silence . SUNDAY 28th Off the Coast , North Atlantic Gale in the night . But today the rain gave way to haze and a light breeze , and I dried out a bit . Mr. Banks and his Gentlemen dipped up some seawater and discussed the creatures found swimming in it . The Gentlemen were full of exclamation and wonder . MONDAY 29th to Tuesday 30th Off the Coast , North Atlantic The weather has turned foul again , and the ship heaves and tosses . I am sick . The Gentlemen have been sick , too . Been at the side regularly . I can say now that Gentlemen heave the contents of their stomach same as eleven-year-old stowaways . WEDNESDAY 31st TO THURSDAY 1st SEPTEMBER Lat. 4456 ' N , Long . 99 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck . Captain had the men everywhere in the rigging , trying to save the ship from being torn to pieces by the wind . Just before first watch the Bosun staggered to the side and shook his fist at the sea , cursing it for stealing his skiff . But ship 's cook , Mr. Thompson , was angrier still . A dozen of his hens drowned in the storm . Mr. Thompson kept muttering how he was never to feed the entire Company if the sea kept killing his livestock . I 'd never seen ship 's cook so close before . He has but one hand ! The storm , at last , is blown out and Endeavour floats easy in the sea again . The servant boy , John Charlton , comes past when he can , leaving bits to eat . He also brings with him good cheer with that kind face of his and that beaming smile . I do n't know much about him but that he is from London , has a friendly nature , and at fifteen years of age has spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red hair reminds him of his mother . He knows his way about , John Charlton does , and he knows the men who brought me aboard . They can be trusted , he said . They 're good men . The men at night sing songs of Spain , and John Charlton says soon we are passing there . He brought me the latitude and longitude readings so I might enter them in my journal and has promised to do so whenever he can . I asked John what I should do about coming out . " Stay hidden , " he said . " If you are discovered now , " he said , " Captain may yet put you off on land and see you returned to England . " FRIDAY 2nd Between Cape Finisterre and Cape Ortegal Spain ! I can not see it from my hiding place , but I heard the cry . The Gentlemen brought their casting nets out and fetched in such creatures I can only imagine . Great were their exclamations of wonder . Their excitement makes my hiding so much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . SATURDAY 3rd Off the Coast of Spain Saw little of the Gentlemen on deck today . At times they are careless and leave a morsel , spiced meat or cheese . Mr. Parkinson , one of the artists Mr. Banks brought aboard to draw the plants and animals we shall see on this voyage , is particularly forgetful with his food . He is a young man with a woman 's hands . I am always interested to hear his observations . He speaks in a clear , light voice unlike any other on board . I have seen much in my imagination , listening to Mr. Parkinson 's reflections . SUNDAY 4th Off the Coast of Spain As the sun was setting , the Gentlemen spied an endless field of little crabs feeding upon the surface of the sea . They cast their net and brought in a dripping lot of the little scuttlers . On deck the crabs glistened in the last rays of sunlight , clicking and slipping over one another . The Gentlemen exclaimed excitedly , and Mr. Banks could not gather the creatures fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird from one of the sailors this morning . It had been tangled in the rigging . The bird died in Mr. Banks 's hands . He had one of his servants rush it to Mr. Parkinson to be drawn . I like all animals , but birds are my favourites . The year after Mother died , when I lived with Grandmother , I would climb trees and watch the birds in their nests . I learned to imitate their calls , so that they would come almost to my hand . Mr. Banks has two greyhound dogs aboard . They sniff at my hiding place in the shelter of the Pinnace . Ordinarily the sight of them would gladden me , but I fear the bad turn they could do me now if they should give me away . But with the pens of livestock around me , no one questions their excitement . Must be the pigs making them act so , Mr. Banks says . TUESDAY 6th Off the Coast of Spain Spain retreats and the Gentlemen gather species from the sea with a wonderful worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewels . Could these creatures possibly be as rich as my mind imagines ? Mr. Parkinson and Mr. Buchan , the other artist aboard , must be very busy men , to draw all the creatures Mr. Banks discovers . He says no sailor has ever troubled before to make such a record . Now his discoveries are forever recorded in Mr. Parkinson 's and Mr. Buchan 's pictures . I listen and imagine what everything looks like . WEDNESDAY 7th Lat. 4029 ' N , Long . 1011 ' W Captain and crew sailed with a spirit of happy speed . Mr. Banks looked out to sea a good part of the day . His posture suggested he was prepared to walk directly upon the water . I think he would ask Captain please to slow down so he might not miss a single fish swimming in his path . But John Charlton says Captain would not listen to such a request . Endeavour goes with the wind . I asked Francis Haite as he coiled rigging nearby if I might come out soon . He swung his old head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 've already begun . THURSDAY 8th Off the Coast of Spain John Ramsay says , " We are pulling away from Cape Saint Vincent , lad , the last of Europe . And soon you shall come out . " It 's difficult deciding what to do first . A wash  --  what with the fleas and a coat of saltwater on my skin , I itch like mad  --  or dinner . I think it shall be dinner . FRIDAY 9th Off the Coast , North Atlantic We are fairly flying over the sea . SATURDAY 10th Off the Coast , North Atlantic In the night I dreamed of the Butcher and woke with a start . My back burned , remembering the bite of his whip . Silently , I slipped out of the Pinnace and crept over to Goat . She nodded , looked me over with a single golden eye , and leaned her weight comfortingly against me . SUNDAY 11th Lat. 341 ' N , Long . 1429 ' W John Charlton says , " Wait until we leave Madeira , Nick . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick end to our voyage . In fact , I 'd like to go on a very long time . The men assure me we shall , as they did that first day I approached them in Deptford Yard . But how much longer can I last in hiding ? MONDAY 12th TO TUESDAY 13th Isle of Madeira I 've wondered how John Charlton knew so much about Captain . Well , it seems John is the Captain 's own underservant and has sailed with him before . The bits he brings me to eat come from the Captain 's own table . John Charlton checked on me as he tended the livestock pens . " We 're heading from here to Brasil , Nick . Then round Cape Horn to King George 's Land . We 've orders from the Lord High Admiral himself . We 're to observe the Planet Venus whilst we 're there . It 's very important , this observation , Nick . Captain says it will tell us how far the Earth is from the Sun and help all men who go to sea ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not know I had stowed away on such an important one . WEDNESDAY 14th Isle of Madeira A terrible accident today . Captain moved Endeavour to a new berth this morning . The anchor did not hold fast on the first attempt and required to be set again . It was brought up and hove out , but this time Mr. Weir , the Quartermaster , found his leg entangled in the anchor rope . In a heartbeat Mr. Weir was over the side along with the anchor . It was a desperate work to bring him back up . The men hove up the line with the greatest urgency . But despite their efforts they were too late . Mr. Weir was drowned . I want only to sleep , but when I close my eyes , I see the Butcher at work on Mr. Weir .
