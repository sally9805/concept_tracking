The sprawling show that opened this month at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City , " 1900 : Art at the Crossroads , " is sure to be a hit with the public . It was a smash in London . Organized by art historian Robert Rosenblum and consisting of 240 paintings and sculptures , it takes an ecumenical and almost judgment-free view of its task , which is to show what kinds of art were being made at the last turn of the century , when the idea of modernism in culture was just forming , and when some of the most admired artists bore names you 'd hardly recognize today  --  not Cezanne , Mondrian , Picasso , but Boldini , Carolus-Duran , Zorn , Sorolla , Vrubel , Toorop and Pellizza da Volpedo . <P> It is an unsettling show for those of programmatic mind , just because it is so inclusive . It shows us the stuff that modernism overthrew , along with plenty of samples of modernism itself . It is , for this reason , fascinating . It is also unmethodical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will therefore be hated by all those who believe in the founding mission of the Guggenheim : to establish modernism , and in particular abstract art , as the ultimate and spiritually obligatory art of the 20th century , to render monumental the gap between past and present . <P> In the year 1900 , the apparent history of art did not have the profile it possesses today . Different artists were considered important ; different painters and sculptors exerted an influence on what was then the present . In some respects the art world was more tolerant , because the notion of an avant-garde was not yet all-encompassing . The ideal of high craft , of sheer manifest skill as a criterion of aesthetic success , had not yet been consigned to the trash can , and artists placed a value on drawing  --  however mistakenly they might sometimes have interpreted it  --  that was still very much alive . <P> The education of an artist was entirely different from what it is today . Indeed , it is unlikely that the students and teachers of 1900 would have recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail in most art schools 100 years later ( especially in America ) as being education at all . Most of the art schools of a century ago produced bad art , but it was of a different kind from our bad art , with different expectations . <P> For these and other reasons , the Guggenheim show entails dramatic reversals of fortune . Certain artists had to be included for what they did long after 1900  --  not for what they were at the time . Picasso , for instance : Would he be remembered if he 'd died at age 19 , known only for his moderately promising pastiches of older artists ? Unlikely . But the idea of Picasso 's being unknown or not much good seems such a contradiction in terms that we have real difficulty imagining it . <P> On the other hand , consider an older Spaniard like Ignacio Zuloaga , long regarded as the discreditable essence of flashy , virtuoso academism . The picture he has in the show  --  a portrait of a sulky-looking , middle-aged dwarf holding a mirrored sphere the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all Spanish realists , Velazquez  --  is a masterpiece of unsparing scrutiny and direct painting , and it brings you up with a jerk .
