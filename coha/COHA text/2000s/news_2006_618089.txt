<p> A federal judge scolded former Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell for leading an office riddled with corruption . Then he sentenced him to 30 months in prison . <p> " As the trial progressed , I was overcome , almost appalled , by the breadth of misconduct in your administration , " U.S. District Judge Richard Story told Campbell on Tuesday during the sentencing hearing in federal court . Later , Story looked Campbell in the eye and said , " I am going to send you to prison , and I do not take that lightly . Within my heart I am not sure you have accepted responsibility for what has transpired . " <p> With the sentence , the judge put the final stamp on a six-year federal investigation into Campbell 's behavior while he was mayor . Prosecutors claimed he ran his office as a corrupt enterprise , taking cash bribes to fund a lavish lifestyle of gambling and international trips with girlfriends . <p> Campbell remained stoic as the sentence was handed down . The 52-year-old , who served two terms as Atlanta 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on three counts of tax evasion but acquitted on racketeering charges and taking thousands of dollars in bribes . <p> Under federal law in determining the sentence , Story was able to consider evidence and testimony presented during the trial about Campbell taking bribes , even though he was acquitted on those charges . <p> In addition to prison time , Story ordered Campbell to pay almost $63,000 in back taxes and a $6,000 fine and to serve a year on probation following his prison term . Prosecutors contended Campbell had evaded paying taxes on about $200,000 in unreported income . <p> Story alluded to the frequent , impromptu news conferences Campbell held on the courthouse steps during his trial in which he proclaimed his innocence and disputed the testimony of government witnesses in detail . The judge implied that Campbell 's lack of contrition was one reason he gave the former mayor such a stiff sentence . <p> Campbell , who did not speak in court , called the sentence an " abomination " as he left the courthouse . He also claimed the judge was trying to undo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . <p> Campbell has frequently called the federal investigation into his dealings " racist , " " an inquisition " and a " witch hunt . " <p> Campbell vowed to file an appeal , which he must do in the next 10 days . <p> If the judge grants him an appeal bond , he will stay out of prison while his appeal is pending . Otherwise , he will report to a federal facility when ordered by the federal Bureau of Prisons . <p> Mark Kadish , professor at Georgia State University 's College of Law , said Story seemed to follow federal guidelines . " I do n't think Campbell will have much of an issue of appeal , " he said , " and I do n't think the judge will give him an appellate bond . " <p> He said Campbell will probably serve his time in a minimum-security prison camp . <p> U.S. attorney responds <p> U.S. Attorney David Nahmias , radiant with victory , said Campbell would have gotten a lighter sentence if he had accepted responsibility for his actions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Campbell obstructed justice probably resulted in an extra six months of prison time . <p> He also responded to charges that his office was out to get Campbell . <p> " Bill Campbell may believe that he has been the center of our universe , and his case was indeed important because of the position he held and the conduct he engaged in , " Nahmias said . But to give some " perspective , " Nahmias said that his office had prosecuted and convicted over 6,000 people since 1999 , when the Campbell investigation began . <p> " Like them , Bill Campbell broke the law , and like most of them , he is going to prison . And we are going back to work , " Nahmias said . <p> Campbell supporters were outraged at the sentence . When court was adjourned , many gathered in the federal courthouse and formed a prayer circle . <p> Steve Labovitz , an attorney who served as Campbell 's chief of staff and testified for the defense , said he was shocked the former mayor got so much jail time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , " he said . " Michael Childs , the one who started this whole investigation , who committed arson , was only given 33 months . " <p> Before the trial , Childs told investigators he paid thousands of dollars in bribes to a Campbell aide because he was promised the mayor would get him a liquor license for his strip club . But prosecutors feared that Childs , who had pleaded guilty to arson in another case , would be a liability , and never called him to the stand . <p> Labovitz noted that Campbell was acquitted on all the substantive charges , except for tax evasion . " All the government witnesses who testified against Campbell had tax issues . None of them are going to jail , " Labovitz said . <p> Although Campbell 's attorneys claimed any failure to pay taxes resulted from " sloppy bookkeeping , " prosecutors told the judge this was n't a case of a man forgetting to pay his taxes . They contended that Campbell worked hard to conceal his illegal activities and then tried to obstruct the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling buddy of Campbell 's , testified Tuesday he gave Campbell records detailing the former mayor 's spending and travel after learning investigators were asking about those subjects . He also secretly taped investigators when they questioned him and turned over to Campbell a rough transcript of the interview . <p> Pascarella owned a travel agency and kept a credit card account to pay for some of Campbell 's travels with girlfriends . During the trial , he testified that Campbell repaid him in cash for those expenses . The arrangement was set up to keep the affairs secret from Campbell 's wife , he said . <p> Judge finds bribery <p> Prosecutors hammered at Campbell 's voracious appetite for spending cash , which nearly tripled from 1996 to 1999 , when he spent $23,600 . At the same time , cash withdrawals from his personal bank accounts shrank each year to just $69 for all of 1999 . <p> Prosecutor Sally Yates , who led the Campbell investigation from the beginning , told the judge that Campbell failed to pay taxes on thousands of dollars in speaking fees , rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's basement , and the campaign funds he used for personal expenses . Campbell paid bills ranging from electricity to school tuition in cash to hide his ill-gotten gains , she said . <p> Outside the courthouse , Yates shook her head and said , " He Campbell still seems to be placing blame on others . " <p> Though the jury found Campbell not guilty of corruption , Story did n't , saying he believed Campbell accepted $55,000 in illegal bribes from city subcontractor Dan DeBardelaben . The jurors were confused by different dates given for the DeBardelaben bribe . After the trial , several jurors said they would have convicted Campbell of racketeering if they had known the dates were not contradictory . <p> Juror Renita L. Stowers said she and fellow jurors believed Campbell was corrupt , but could n't put the money in his hands . <p> " I 'm pleased with how it turned out , " Stowers said . " He deserves his punishment like everybody else . Just because he was the mayor does n't mean he should get away with what he done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lead defense attorney Billy Martin , who argued for a probated sentence , called the government 's arguments " outrageous " and " desperate . " <p> Defense attorneys tried to show that Campbell won money at casinos and in high-stakes Friday night poker games with friends , including Pascarella . <p> Defense attorney Jerry Froelich criticized prosecutors for speculating about how much cash Campbell had and how he got it . <p> " Winning at a casino is not illegal and I do n't know anyone prosecuted for Friday night card games , " Froelich said . He later said that no one knows how much Campbell won . " Gamblers just do n't keep track , " he said . " It 's just bad luck . " <p> According to defense calculations , Campbell owed the government $11,346 in back taxes , based on about $40,500 of unreported income , Martin said . <p> For the first time , Campbell attorneys argued that one of the sources of cash he used to fuel his lifestyle was his late mother , June , who they said gave Campbell $20,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter from Campbell 's mother in the pre-sentencing report as evidence that she gave her son money . <p> Yates said that the $20,000 gift from June Campbell would have taken about " half her income " in a given two-year period , and therefore it was incredible to think Campbell 's mother provided him with that much cash . <p> Defense attorney Martin retorted : " It 's not for them prosecutors to say that his mother is so poor she ca n't afford to give her son $20,000 . " <p> After the sentencing , Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin , Campbell 's successor in office , wished the former mayor 's family well . She added that it was unfortunate that there was " a sense that people ca n't trust the government . " <p> Angelo Fuster , who served two years as Campbell 's communications director , said the sentencing " seems like a sad , inevitable ending to a story that should have ended so differently . It 's a cautionary tale that no matter how talented you are you need to keep a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . But it came to a crashing end . " <p> Former Atlanta police Deputy Chief Lou Arcangeli was blunt when he commented on the sentence . <p> " The words that come to mind are sordid , hedonistic , squalid , self-centered and selfish  --  and I voted for him , " Arcangeli said . " There 's a Dirty Dozen of convicted city officials during his years in office and he 's the chairman of the board . What a legacy . " <p> Staff writers Mae Gentry , Shelia Poole and S.A.
