ON A BLEAK NOVEMBER afternoon , while searching Highway 1 for an errant grand-pup , Dazzle was snapped up by the SPCA and transported to the Animal Preservation Facility in Ventura , where he was printed , tagged , and impounded . " Preservation , hah , that 's a laugh , " Dazzle thought out loud as he was corralled into a mesh-wire compound . " Elimination of unreliable elements - that 's more like it . " By the time the shock wore off , Dazzle found himself immured by hypersanitary living conditions , cold-eyed Animal Welfare Agents , and just about the sorriest collection of fellow mutts he had ever encountered . <p> " So I do n't get it , " Dazzle opined to anybody who would listen . " They de-worm and de-louse us , shoot us full of antibiotics , and when we 're healthy enough , they throw us into this steel trap where we 're expected to piss through the floors , and drink out of rusty bowls . But that 's all part of the process of deindividuation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our blood , while committing our bodies to this state of immaculate unliving called Animal Preservation . What they want to preserve , of course , is everything that is n't animal . Everything that is n't us . I mean , look at this bedding , for Christ 's sake . Is that a vinyl beanbag chair or what ? It 's not comfort they 're aiming at . It 's something you can hose down , turn over , and re-use again . I mean , at the end of the day , life is n't about how many identical , machinery-manufactured days you endure , one after another . It 's about the odd and insignificant moments . The ones you ca n't quantify . The ones that wo n't happen again , or exactly the same way . " <p> While Dazzle was accustomed to being ignored , he found his fellow inmates especially irksome . For rather than acknowledging Dazzles wrong-footed efforts at communication , they either growled him away from their Nibbles , or tried to mount him from behind and fuck him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dazzle yelped , shaking free the latest serial-perv with a hippy little snap . " That 's quite a grip you got there . I may be neutered , but that does n't make me queer - nothing personal , pal . It 's just the way I am . " <p> Everywhere Dazzle turned , his cell-mates were engaged in closet  --  busting activities , as if the very meaning of privacy had been turned inside-out . They freely licked themselves and one another in every conceivable orifice . They fucked each other in the bottom , and poohed in the water bowl , and dry-humped the bedding . They whined in self-doubt and yelped at bad dreams . And at the drop of a hat , they fought fiercely and endlessly over nothing , gouging and clawing and gnashing and shredding . <p> " If I told you once I told you a thousand times - stay away from my Nibbles ! " <p> " Do n't look at me that way or even think what you 're thinking ! " <p> " What 's oozing from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed that . " <p> " I hate you I hate you I hate you I hate you . " <p> " Hate me hate me hate me hate . " <p> There were times when Dazzle felt like a bit of meat hurled into the gasketed vortices of some mighty machine - a process for producing pies , say , or a sharply pronged chicken defeatherer . Everything that was most mindless about dogs had been amplified until all you could hear was the raucous metal whine of denaturized stuff : bile , testosterone , greed , fear , denial and rage . <p> " You guys are the end of language , " Dazzle told them , curled up with disbelief in a corner . " You guys are the end of rational thought . Is n't this the part where we 're supposed to band together , organize , sing songs and rage against the darkness ? It 's not us against each other anymore . It 's us against them , and I just do n't get you guys , I really do n't . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yours . " <p> " Where are the puppies , Daddy ? " <p> " They 're in the other pen , sweetheart . These are the grown-up doggies . The ones that got lost from their masters and nobody wants . " <p> " Can we see the puppies now ? " <p> " It never hurts to look , sweetheart . Like this doggy here ? He 's a big doggy , but he looks nice , does n't he ? " <p> Of all the indignities Dazzle had suffered in his life , visiting hours took the biscuit . Every weekday afternoon , human beings in search of pliable pets were hustled past on their way to the nursery , but they never stayed long . After all , nobody wants a self-formed dog with his own fully formed opinions about life . They want malleable , just-weaned babies they can mold into treat-mongers , circus chimps , and guard dogs . They want dogs who take what you give them and never complain . <p> " I do n't know , Daddy , " the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so funny ? " <p> " What do you mean , sweetheart ? He 's a pretty dog and well-mannered . He 's just looking at you that way because oh , I see . That is a funny look , is n't it ? It 's almost as if , as if . " <p> " It 's like he does n't like me , Daddy . But I 'm not important enough to make him mad . " <p> Bingo , Dazzle thought , gazing into the moppet 's muddy brown eyes . Dazzle had never been terribly fond of human beings , but at least the adults remembered to feed , water and run you on occasion . Moppets , however , were always dressing you in doll clothes and trying to tempt you with their sugary sodas , fast-food sandwiches and candy bars , as if you were too stupid to know twenty-four-carat crap when you saw it . <p> " Yes , darling , well , at least we gave the older doggies a sporting chance . Now , let me at those puppies ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all sorts of neat tricks . How about you ? " <p> " And it 'll love me , wo n't it , Daddy ? It 'll love me more than anything . Even more than its own mommy ! " <p> As the human visitors were ushered happily toward the nursery , where the pulse-pleasing cacophony of puppies filled the air like jingly Muzak , Dazzle felt only relief . <p> " My mommy was a neurotic bitch who lived behind a dumpster in Van Nuys , " Dazzle thought after them , with the sense of quiet grandeur that only comes to those without hope . " And for the record , chickie you 'll never take the place of my mommy . " <p> Dazzle knew that he and his fellow inmates were all traveling down the same short conveyor belt to nowhere . <p> " You 're tagged with this number , right ? Around your neck . There , right there , " Dazzle explained to the only dog who paid attention , a mixed wire-hair spaniel with weird rubbery growths on his face named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the month you were processed , see ? Which means we 've each got thirty days to find our way out of here , by hook or by crook . And when those days are up , so are you , pal . Poof . In South America , you 've entered the ranks of los desaparecidos . And once that happens , it 's like you 've never been born . " <p> Grunt was an unusually curious dog , part border collie on his father 's side , who could sit for hours watching words issue from Dazzles lips like glistening soap bubbles . <p> " You talk and I 'll listen , " Grunt assured Dazzle . " It 's like I got this reverse attention-deficit thing going , comprende ? I got ta keep staring at somebody , or I kinda go completely nuts . " <p> In many ways , Grunt was the perfect friend for Dazzle , who liked to talk , but was n't so wild about listening . <p> " Human civilization is like this big machine , right ? " Dazzle would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Turning everything we are into everything we 're not . Surplus value , commodities , spin , psycho-babble , culture , landfill , graphs . And when they 're done , we wo n't be dogs anymore . We 'll be a record of human efficiency . We 'll be a pie chart displayed at the next managerial meeting that makes everybody look good . How quickly we were eliminated - that 'll matter . How cost  --  efficiently we were incinerated - that 'll matter too . But the moral and theological and philosophical reasoning behind why we were needled in the first place , well , nobody will waste much time on that . They are n't the sort of questions that can be submitted with your next budget proposal , hear what I 'm saying ? You want to build that golden parachute , you 're better off leaving those questions alone . " <p> " Absitively ! " Grunt yipped . " Posolutely ! " Grunt was so deeply affirmative that he seemed to glow . " Tell it like it is , Dazzle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> In fact , Grunt was so exhaustingly attentive that sometimes , without expecting it , Dazzle actually ran out of things to say . He looked at Grunt looking at him . He pursed his lips , licked them . He lay down on the cold mesh floor , closed his eyes , and felt Grunt 's intensity drilling through the back of his neck like an electronic probe . <p> " Are you going to sleep ? " Grunt asked wonderingly . " I ca n't tell you how interesting you are . Look , you get all the rest you need , and I 'll be here when you wake up . Sometimes I can take a little nap with my eyes open , I do n't even know it 's happening . So do n't be startled , Dazzle . The moment you wake up , I 'll already be here . " <p> ON THE SAME rainy afternoon that the ward 's biggest bullies , Spike and Fatso , were led to the Dispensary yipping about " Snacks ! Bitches ! Sunlight ! Snacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Adult Male Holding Facility . Her name was Dr. Harriet Harmony and she wielded a clipboard , a severely bitten plastic ball-point , and a wallet-sized electronic calculator . <p> " Uh oh , " Dazzle told Grunt , who was at that moment chewing his toes in a way that Dazzle found particularly revolting . " I do n't like the look of this babe what , so , ever . " <p> Dr. Harriet Harmony had received her B.A. in Animal Husbandry from Iowa State , and her doctorate from Princeton . She wore sensible shoes , wire-rim bifocals , and a crude , hasty bob which might well have been self-administered with a prison shaving mirror and a cereal bowl . <p> " Vivisection , " Grunt growled darkly , and crawled under Dazzles tail to hide . It was the longest word Dazzle had ever heard uttered by a dog to whom he was n't genetically related . <p> " Which of you big boys would like to go with Dr. Harmony ? " asked Maggie , the floor supervisor . To get their attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thip thip , as if she were petting a huge scaly reptile . " Guess what Doctor Harmony has at her housy-wousy ? A big bowl of meaty Alpo . " <p> The very word struck a chill into Dazzles heart . Whenever human beings were about to do something truly unconscionable to a dog , they always promised him Alpo . <p> Flipping through the forms on her clipboard , Dr. Harmony confirmed the identity of one random mutt after another with a brisk switch of her pen . Check . Check . <p> " Too big , " she noted out loud . " Too furry . Too purebred . Too mean . " <p> It 's times like this you believe in precognition , Dazzle thought . For from the moment Dr. Harmony appeared , Dazzle knew they were meant for each other . <p> " What about this one ? " Dr. Harmony asked . <p> She was n't looking at Dazzle . She was looking at Adult Male No. 4243/8-30 . <p> " Oh , is n't he a cutey , " Maggie enthused . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you want to go with Dr. Harmony , you big cutey ? You big hairy cutey you ! " <p> Dazzle was allowed no time at all to console poor Grunt , who leapt and spun about fiercely as if he were being teased by a bone on a bungee  --  cord . <p> " Do n't worry , Grunt ! " Dazzle shouted as he was pulled down the corridor on Maggie 's leather leash . " If they torture me to death for the sake of improving human deodorants , at least I 'll glimpse the blue sky again on my way out ! And come to think of it , who would n't like to see some improvement in human deodorants , anyway ? I 'm all for it - what about you ? <p> For once , Dazzle 's words had a resounding effect on his fellow dogs . " Human smells ! " they barked . " How we hate those awful human smells ! " <p> " Do n't let them hook anything to your testicles ! " Grunt shouted . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they want to hook anything to my testicles , they 'll have to call my old vet in Reseda Hills and find out where he buried ' em . Take care of yourself , pal . And keep a tight asshole , dig ? " <p> It happened so fast that Dazzle never knew what hit him . He was re  --  tagged and re-registered , driven to West Los Angeles in a minivan , and re  --  confined in a smaller , tidier private accommodation in the Egyptian-style monolith of the Center for Applied Sciences at UCLA . <p> " Welcome to your new home , " Dr. Harmony told him , and curtly disappeared with her clipboard . <p> The accommodation was equipped with a water dispenser , a yelp  --  activated shower , and , lo and behold , a fresh bowl of Alpo . <p> " You 're not fooling me with that old trick , " Dazzle grumbled , and curled up disdainfully on the floor beside the clean fragrant cotton futon , which was adorned with bright , squeaky rubber toys and rawhide bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want . And I 'll decide if I 'm giving it to you or not . " <p> Within the hour , Dr. Harmony returned with her Senior Research Supervisor and a pretty young court reporter named Carol . <p> " Welcome to UCLA , " Dr. Marvin said slowly , as if he were addressing a roomful of neatly attired , multinational students in a TEFL course . <p> The stenographer , cued by Dr. Marvin 's non-aggressive smile , began to type . <p> **31;461;TOOLONG <p> " We hope you have found everything satisfactory - " <p> **35;494;TOOLONG <p> " And that you will graciously accept this opportunity to meet with the recently endowed Department of Animal Linguistics on an equal footing - " <p> **35;531;TOOLONG <p> " Let 's put the ugly days of blood-hurling demonstrators and bad publicity behind us . With the kind and generous support of Animals Alive ! , itself the officially registered charity of sport-shoe entrepreneur and widely recognized animal-lover , R. Wallace McShane , we are about to forge a new era in human-animal relations . " <p> **36;568;TOOLONG . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvin and Dr. Harmony exchanged curt , professional smiles . Then , in one smoothly synchronized motion , they entered Dazzles cell , crouched , and offered their hands in a gesture of olfactory openness and good faith . <p> Dazzle could n't work up enough enmity to growl . Had he his druthers , he would have liked to forge a new era of human-animal relations in Dr. Harmony 's fat butt . <p> At which point Dr. Harmony slipped one hand into the vest pocket of her white lab coat , grabbed Dazzle by the haunch and injected him with the largest , nastiest hypodermic he had ever seen . <p> " Yowzah ! " Dazzle expostulated , starting to his feet as the numbness spread to his haunches , his ribs , his face , his tongue . <p> " You goddamn , goddamn , " Dazzle said . <p> And collapsed unconscious to the floor . <p> As Dazzle eventually learned , Dr. Harmony was inspired as a young girl by the best-selling fictional reflections of a sage , beneficent ape who had many wise things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convergences of nature . This ape bore no grudge against the homo saps who had enslaved him in a zoo , since he pitied their collective inability to love , or be loved , with total sincerity . <p> " I guess that sensitive , beautiful creature taught me everything I know about Nature , " Dr. Harmony confessed , drifting beside Dazzle in the dreamily burbling laboratory . " I learned to look beyond my petty , callous concerns , and to devote my career to exploring the spiritual oneness of Nature . I learned that this oneness invests every living creature on our planet , no matter how small , grubby or ignoble . It invests doggies , and kitties , and monkeys , and me . I want you to know that I consider you a lot more important than some silly , tenure-achieving article in Nature or Biology Today , and I hope we wo n't remain divided from one another by the false dichotomy of humans-slash-animals . What I hope is that we 'll learn to respect one another as friends . " <p> Dazzle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed current of Dr. Harmony 's voice . He only knew that she was with him , then she was n't , and then she was with him again . <p> " I guess what I 'm trying to say is that we all make sacrifices every day for Nature . And in times like these , Nature can clearly use all the help she can get . " <p> WHEN DAZZLE AWOKE he found himself drifting in a huge , gelatin-filled tank in a wide , omniscient laboratory buzzing with video cameras and metabolic gauges . His eyeballs were sewn open ; his paws were bound in see-through plastic tape ; and an array of multi-colored , follicular implants sprouted from his forehead like a cybernetic tou . <p> " We call it a syntactical eductor , " Dr. Marvin explained , standing before Dazzles immersion tank with the rapt , wide-open stare of a child observing his first jellyfish at the aquarium . " As you will soon understand , it 's not words that generate meaning , but the arrangements between words . Subject and object , subjunctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which our brains weave of things , thoughts , and sensations . Deprived of semantics , we drift through a universe of disparity and contradiction . We do n't know which way is up , or how far , or how to get there from here . We ca n't distinguish us from them , or him from her , or being from what used to be . No wonder you poor animals have such a hard time , herded mindlessly from one form of oppression to another . You never learn right from wrong . You never learn volition from fate . And you can only comprehend one word at a time , like Sit , Shake , Dinnertime , and Kiss-kiss . But today , Mr. Adult Male No. 4243 , is the first day of the rest of your life . And when you receive the Promethean gift of syntax , you will engage everything that comes with it . Synchronicity , intention , history , and causation . So now it 's time , Mr. Adult Male No. 4243 . It 's time for you doggies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At this point , Dr. Marvin performed a smooth physical elision , and Dr. Harmony stepped forward to take his place . She held a compact digital microphone , as if she were about to perform some high-tech version of karaoke . <p> " Me like doggy , " Dr. Harmony enunciated , placing her flat , bitten fingernails against the glass of Dazzles container . " Me protect doggy . Doggy help me . Me help doggy . " <p> There was something so horrific about the concentrated sincerity of Dr. Harmony 's face that Dazzle could n't bear to watch . Meanwhile , the electronically translated words clanked hollowly among his wired  --  synapses , like chords plunked out on a child 's xylophone . <p> Dazzles brain , quite literally , rattled . <p> " Doggy eat Nibbles through tube , " Dr. Harmony said , indicating the feeder inserted through Dazzles belly . " Doggy go wee-wee and poo-poo without getting dirty , " she said , indicating the yellow coil of Dazzles catheter , and the brownish-green one of his colonic irrigator . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , miming the removal of fragrant words from her mouth , and presenting them to Dazzle like red rubber chew toys . <p> " Doggy speak nice to me ? What do you say , doggy ? Me want to hear your words very much . " <p> The inflections pinged in Dazzles brain like the chimes of a cash register . And for once , the space that emerged at the end of a human question mark was an invitation , not simply a playful taunt . <p> Dazzle wished he were the sort of dog who could resist that invitation . But of course he was n't . <p> " Spuh , " Dazzle said . His metal voice rasped on the overhead speakers like a dog-chain sliding across a stainless steel bowl . " Spun , spuh . " <p> Until a voice emerged that sounded just like James Earl Jones announcing the divine presence of CNN : <p> " Spuh-spuh-spare me the condescending horseshit , sister . And do n't you dare talk to me like I 'm stupid . " <p> It was nothing like catharsis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remnant of himself with somebody else 's words . For seven days and seven nights , Dazzle raged at the blunt world , hitting it with all the stuff he had in him : iron negativity and rage . It was a bizarrely liberating experience . <p> He raged at their illusions about Democracy : " Okay , so every country 's divided up between these two cosmetically antithetical political parties , and they both represent People With Money . Is n't that what 's called a tautology ? Two absurdly redundant propositions . That 's what your political process looks like to me , honey . A human fucking tautology . " <p> He raged at their illusions about Dogs : " Of course we roll over and wag our stupid tails and follow you around the house , mewling and twitching at every scrap of affection . We 're prisoners , for Christ 's sake . If we live in the basement , who else will feed us ? Certainly not that idiotic mailman , who does nothing useful but shove rolled-up newspapers through the door . And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , irrational submission to authority . If you ask me ( and I hate to remind you , but you did ask me , and now I 'm telling you ) that mailman deserves all the grief he can get . " <p> And without mercy or remorse , he raged at their illusions about Nature : " So what do you tell yourself about this Grand Project , Dr. Harmony , alone in your bed at night ? Personally , I 've got you pegged as a Dances with Wolves girl - wow , you should have seen yourself flinch . You 've probably got the Director 's Cut on DVD , right ? And you light all your scented candles after a hot bath in some slinky robe , and stretch out on that crummy student couch you 've still got with the itchy osier fabric , and you are Native Woman , are n't you , Dr. Harmony , and you will purify your Kevin baby in the musky sea of your loins , with that adorable moustache of his and that oh-so-striking uniform . And he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magic ways of - cool it , Dr. Harmony , okay , I 'll stop . But before I do , let me tell you something about Mother Nature . She 's got crabs , and lice , and about eight billion venereal infections , and every ingrown hair and toenail usually develops into this oozing , life-threatening abscess . I are nature , Dr. Harmony , and do I sound wise and benevolent to you ? You do n't have to answer that , Dr. Harmony . What you think about me is written all over your face . " <p> And ultimately , Dazzle raged even at the hard-bought illusions of Himself : " So I developed this extended family in the woods , right , with this practically autistic bitch who 's always taking rips out of my ass , and about a thousand step-pups and step-grandpups running around , bickering and fighting all the time and copulating with anything that moves , and it feels , it feels all right . It feels like what you guys call really " grown up . " And I drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while , sentimental dreams of wholeness and True Being , tinged with irony and all that , but in the world of bloody-minded civilization versus bloodyminded Nature , is n't everything tinged with irony , whether we like it or not ? And here I am , this creature with a few brains still left in his head , trying to teach the pups about being true to themselves , and doing the best they can , and all that rubbish , and what 's happening to the world while I 'm away , Dr. Harmony ? Are dogs receiving progressively better treatment at the hands of you and your fellow saps ? Are social institutions growing more progressive and humane ? Is even the notion of equality between species being knocked around by college eggheads like yourself , not because dogs and cats are that smart or anything , but look at the lie of the land , Dr. Harmony . We sure as hell are n't any stupider than you guys . And when I get my bottom tossed into that dandy little concentration camp called Animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it on myself somehow , and watching my fellow dogs brutalize one another in every conceivable fashion , it starts to feel like dying , Dr. Harmony . I do n't know how else to explain it . Like I 'm saying good-bye to every illusion I ever had about myself or my fellow dogs . I never wanted to die , Dr. Harmony , but something happened to me the last few weeks , and these days , I do n't much want to live , either . And now that I 'm given the opportunity to say what 's on my mind , it 's like all I 've got to say is , well , nothing . Nowhere . No how . And I 'm left to wonder what you think about all this . Me , this chattering dog in this huge fishbowl , talking your head off for seven days and seven nights . What do you think about what I 'm saying , Dr. Harmony ? Answer that question , and it 'd be like discourse , right . The first step toward something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Harmony . What do you have to tell me ? " <p> Not-so-surprisingly , Dr. Harmony missed her cue . Flanked by Dr. Marvin ( writing a grant proposal ) and the court reporter ( tappily transcribing the ineluctable data that was Dazzle ) , Dr. Harmony gazed into the translucent goo as if trying to remember where she left her car keys . <p> " What I think , " Dr. Harmony said emptily . The pistons missed a beat , then another . " What I think . You want to know what I think . " <p> Even Dr. Marvin put down his Bic . And the court reporter , sensing a rare opportunity , reached for her warm can of diet soda and took a long , habit-clenching swallow . <p> " What I think is , well . I guess it 's this . I think it 's time for you to shut the fuck up , you stupid annoying mutt . " <p> They deactivated the recording machines , the lights and the overhead fans , and everybody - with the obvious exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the first time in a week that Dazzle had the opportunity to hear himself think . " You can either talk or think , " Dazzle often told his foster-pups and grand-pups . " But you ca n't do both at the same time . " <p> When Dazzle was just a teething pup , he knew the meaning of words before he knew the words themselves . " Yip , " he might tell Mom , shaking his nose at the blue sky . Yip : clouds . Yip : cars . Yip yip : Last night I saw a blazing meteor . Yip yip yip yip : I love catching buzzy flies in my mouth . In many ways , the words themselves had n't mattered , for whatever Dazzle said , Mom smiled fondly and licked his face . <p> I was speaking my me , Dazzle thought . And that 's all that mattered to Mom . The language we inhabited whenever we lay together . <p> Yip , Dazzle thought now , drifting in the slow tremble of gelatin like a chunk of pineapple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images appeared on the screen of his imagination : a ball , a stick , a bowl of Nibbles . Yip . A cardboard box . Yip . A meaty bone . Yip . A urine-scented tree . We speak our minds and other creatures do n't quite understand , Dazzle thought . Which is , I 'm afraid , what language is all about . <p> The following morning , Dazzle made his demands known to the first employee to reactivate the overhead lighting . <p> " Basically , tell Dr. Harmony I 'll be issuing a list of demands at oh  --  nine-hundred hours , and I 'd like our court reporter present . And Dr. Marvin , of course , is more than welcome - though what constitutes his actual purpose around here , other than signing his name to the articles his grad students write , presently eludes me . Also , you might suggest it 's time to fly R. Wallace Mar-Shane down from Marin . He and I should share some major face time oh , and one more thing . I 'd like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My name , if you have n't noticed , is Dazzle . " <p> R. Wallace MacShane was an all-right kind of guy . He flew an energyefficient private jet . He wore nonblend earth tone slacks , shirts and shoes . He provided his nonunion domestic employees with a near-Union-scale wage , pension scheme and medical plan . And he always referred to his underpaid nondomestic employees as brave pioneers of the burgeoning Third World superstate . <p> " So here we are , " Robbie said , clapping his warm , well-manicured hands together . Robbie liked to begin every tete-d-tete as if he were getting down to a happy weekend of Dad-and-son touch football . " Dr. Marvin . Dr. Harmony . Me and , well . You . " <p> A blink was the closest Robbie ever came to a shrug . <p> " Our , uh , our esteemed canine colleague who , through the aid of modern technology , has crossed the great cultural divide to speak to us from the hallowed , er- " <p> Dazzle did n't have time for this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , confused squeal of feedback from the overhead speakers . " Are the tapes running ? They are ? Then , Carol , will you begin transcribing ? We should begin . " <p> As a pup , Dazzle had spent many lazy afternoons in front of the television watching black and white reruns of Thin Man movies on Dialing for Dollars . In these highly unrealistic Depression era mysteries , William Powell and Myrna Loy wandered from one drunken m6lde to another , uncovering corpses , making friends with heartsick young people , and getting completely sozzled along the way . Then , during the closing minutes , they would solve the accumulated crimes at a recitation attended by their surviving friends , a few random gangsters , and the local Police Chief , who could n't catch a cold without their help . Meanwhile , their useless pooch , Asta , chewed the carpets and performed backflips like a trained bear at the circus . <p> This one 's for you , Asta , Dazzle thought . <p> " So at first I figure it 's just age-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's history lesson and all that . Big time academics reaching down to shake the paw of lowly canines , air play on all the networks , drive-time talk and late-night panel . Hey , before you know it , you 've got your well-verbalized pooch appearing regularly on ' Stupid Human Tricks/or maybe he 's one of the more lovable castaways on the next all-species edition of Survivor . They keep spelling your names right , and the name of this fine institution . This attracts more grants , and more notoriety , and pretty soon I 'm like that sheep they cloned , that Daisy Whatever . It 's not progress that matters - just the same Public Relations machine grinding out copy copy copy . At least dogs piss where they think it might do some good , but you guys . You just love the smell of yourselves , do n't you ? You just love to spread it around . " <p> R. Wallace MacShane firmly stood his ground , and smiled the smile he was known for . It was the sort of smile he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening , " R. Wallace MacShane said . And , for the first time that morning , he took a chair beside Dr. Harmony , who was slurping Red Zinger from a hefty-sized Doctor Dolittle II promotional mug . " My conference call is n't till ten-thirty . " <p> If Dazzle could have smiled , he would have given R. Wallace MacShane a run for his money . Instead , Dazzle leaned back in his roomy mind and produced the only emphasis at his disposal . <p> He modulated . <p> " Ahh , " Dazzles smoother , warmer voice said out loud . " I think we 're almost done . " <p> At which point , Dazzle let them have it . <p> " But one way or another , things do n't look good for yours truly . I 'm not lovable or charming or telegenic . I do n't do tricks on demand . And you 've clearly dumped a good chunk of grant-manna on wiring me up to these dohickeys , and what 's to show for it ? An irascible , antisocial canine who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which leaves you with two choices . You can perform an expensive surgical reversal , unhook and delinguify me , then suture up all these too-exposed nerves and whatnot . Or you can cut all the cables and toss me in the dumpster , right along with poor old Adult Males No. 1 through 4242 . I 'm guessing you 've tagged me for the dumpster . What are the odds , guys ? You gon na make me famous or make me dead ? " <p> Dr. Marvin made a point of not looking at Dr. Harmony . <p> Dr. Harmony made a point of looking directly at Dr. Marvin . <p> Ha , Dazzle thought . I think we call that gin . <p> " Which leaves me swimming in this soup , " Dazzle resumed smartly . " Wondering what I can offer you guys in exchange for my sorry bones back . And that 's when I think the magic word . The only word that keeps pointing itself directly at me . " <p> Dazzle paused for effect . <p> " Nibbles , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticeable glitch , as if his software had gone slightly ditzy . <p> " Nibbles , " Dazzle continued , " are like the only common denominator I can find , right ? Nibbles at the Animal Preservation Center . Nibbles being pulverized by that whirring processor and pumping into my veins through these tubes . Nibbles Inc. , which is a minor subsidiary of Worldco Foods , which is itself coproprietor of Kidco Shoes , which is controlled by a panel of stockholders appointed by the very same CEO who appoints them , and who just happens to be sitting in this room . Robbie , our golden boy . Robert Wallace MacShane . " <p> Robbie performed a curt little bow . <p> " It 's like some basic elemental matter , the building blocks of the universe . Not atoms or energy or karma , but Nibbles , and it comes in a variety of flavors . Barbecued ribs . Chicken Korma . Tuna Surprise . And for those diabetic dogs , there 's sugar-free VeggieBurger Plus , with all the flavor and protein of real meat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you 're discussing the Holy Grail or something , or the latest souffle whizzed up by Wolfgang Puck . But the fact of the matter , as any dog can tell you , is that Nibbles taste like shit . I mean , imagine dirt clods sprinkled with pesticides and chemicals and you 're in the same ballpark . You could soak this stuff in water for a thousand years and it would still taste like dirt clods . And what does it say on the outside of every Nibbles container ever produced in the history of this planet ? It says : " Dogs love ' em ! " Does n't that make you wonder , Robbie ? How you guys can produce Nibbles by the boatload and tell everybody dogs love ' em when nobody really knows what dogs love . Or , for that matter , even cares . " <p> R. Wallace MacShane was getting his smile back . He was even drumming his neatly manicured fingers on his knee , as if to remind himself that time was moving again . <p> " My dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should see Rex gobble them up . " <p> It would make me sad , Dazzle thought . If it did n't make me so angry . <p> " What choice do you give Rex ? " Dazzle asked . " I mean , does Rex love Nibbles more than , say , chicken-fried steak ? Try putting a bowl of Salsa-flavored Nibbles next to a hunk of chicken-fried steak , Robbie , and tell me which one Rex really loves best . " <p> It all makes sense , Dazzle thought , watching the various faces watch him . Dr. Marvin : thinking about the grant-appropriations committee that afternoon . Dr. Harmony : thinking about how much she loathes Dr. Marvin . And Carol , the stenographer , looking at her can of Diet Tab with a new and unformed expression . Could she be thinking about possible connections between Nibbles and Diet Tab ? <p> You could never be sure who would be the first person in a room to figure out what was really going on . <p> Robbie stopped drumming his fingers . Like any good negotiator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding all the best cards offered you the only deal in town . <p> " Bring me the Yellow Pages , " Dazzle instructed . " Turn them to Entertainment Lawyers , and hook me to the intercom . Meanwhile , Dr. Harmony should get her skates on and hustle over to Animal Preservation , where my pal Grunt will be staring into the eye of a pretty nasty hypodermic about now . Then , and only then , we 'll talk contract . " <p> AFTER A FEW WEEKS of physio , Dazzle regained most of his old poise and swagger ; and once the sutures began to heal , he booked himself and Grunt into the Ventura Doggy Motel , where they were treated to a hot flea-shampoo , a chicken-fried steak , and a few sharp , well-received tonguefuls of strawberry schnapps . But even after Dazzles hair grew back over the scar tissue , his expression retained a weird , jig-jawish incongruity , as if he were looking in both directions at once . <p> " Every so often , life takes us apart , " Dazzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide world . " And if we 're lucky , we live long enough to put ourselves back together again . But along the way , we lose these little pieces of ourselves , and enduring these losses is what life is all about . Not paving ourselves over with cosmetic surgery , or spackle , or bad faith . But wearing our brokenness openly in our hearts , and in our faces . " <p> As per Dazzles instructions , . the Oldsmobile Towncar dropped them off at the intersection of PCH and Spring Valley Road . Unsurprisingly ( at least to Dazzle ) this intersection was marked by a self-illuminating Nibbles billboard , as big as a barn . <p> " Maybe I sold out , Grunt . I do n't know . I 've always believed in speaking the truth as well as my crude tongue allows , but sometimes you just , well . You just want your life back . You just want to save your hairy butt and move on . " <p> Dazzle and Grunt were standing on the freeway 's soft shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The billboard 's caption read : <p> LATEST SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES CONFIRM DOGS LOOOOOOVE NEW , IMPROVED BOLOGNESE-FLAVORED NIBBLES MORE THAN FRESH MEAT ! <p> Dazzle could abide the caption . What he could n't abide was the tiny , asterisked confirmation which ran along the baseboard like the health warning on a cigarette pack : <p> *THESE STATEMENTS CONFIRMED BY EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED AT UCLA ANIMAL RESEARCH LABORATORIES ; DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE ON REQUEST <p> Staring up at that monumental load of drivel , Dazzle could n't help sighing at the enormity of language . It 's us who should be speaking words , he thought . But more often than not , it 's words that speak us . <p> Despite showing a brave face to Grunt , Dazzle did not feel victorious , or smug , or even clever . In fact , he did n't feel much of anything - not pleasure , or joy , or love , or even rage . He felt only weakness in his heart , and the deep impress of too many years . Standing at the junction of four roads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why one road might be more useful than any other . <p> They might have sat there until nightfall had it not been for the unpredictable impatience of Grunt . <p> " Sometimes we have to fight like hell just to keep a little bit of what we 've already got , " Grunt said , with the sort of slow , surprising wisdom Dazzle forgot could exist in a fellow dog . " Wind , trees , rocks , sunlight , clouds and tears . just the little things that keep us interested.The things that keep us looking for something outside ourselves . " <p> It was the sort of self-evident wisdom Dazzle had always hoped to develop , perhaps when he was older and less prone to querying . But somehow , this wisdom had come to him through a completely unexpected source : the totally unremarkable voice of a fellow dog . <p> Who would 've figured ? <p> " Someday , Dazzle , you 'll stop talking long enough to listen , " Grunt said gently , as if he could read Dazzles mind . " Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> At which point , Grunt showed Dazzle the fastest route out of town . <p> Sidebar
