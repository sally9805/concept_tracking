Headnote Small house ? No problem . A new perspective on outdoor living takes the party outside . God design is a journey . The twists and turns in any road to discovery can make the learning process as memorable as the moment of arrival . For a designer , the experience is no different , especially when the project is for your own backyard . Gavin Duke 's trip began with only one goal-to make good use of the long , narrow lot of the home he shares with his wife , Lorie . Inspired by an alle he had seen in Belgium , this Nashville landscape architect had an " aha " moment when he decided to divide his backyard into two sections , focusing first on the one directly behind his home . Not What You Think From the patio , Gavin 's alle boasts the elegance of a European garden , but turn around toward the house , and his sense of humor becomes apparent . You 'll feast your eyes on a quaint bungalow rather than the palatial estate you were expecting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,100-square-foot home , they drop their jaws when they see what 's out the back door . The Path Taken Gavin knew that a special structure was needed to draw people out of the house and into the garden . In architecture , a " folly " is denned as a fanciful building constructed with little use in mind other than entertaining the eye , but this one even satisfies the soul . Gavin used his folly to stop the axis created by the alle of London plane trees ( Platanus x acerifolia ) , a practice common in classical Italian garden design . ( If you live in the Coastal South , sycamores are a better choice for creating an alle . ) People are drawn naturally to the ultimate focal point . " We 've spent many evenings lingering with friends over glasses of wine out here , " says Lorie . Intelligent Design The natural 8-foot drop from the back of the house to the property line spawned another idea : Force the perspective to make the distance from the patio to the folly ( about 40 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gavin chose to pollard ( severely prune ) the newly planted London plane trees so that those closest to the folly were shorter than the ones by the patio . To maintain the look , he prunes the trees yearly . Combined with the change in elevation , this trick works like magic . Thoughtful Choices Broom-finished concrete with a coat of stain was a frugal option for the patio , but Gavin splurged on a custom-cut limestone coping for the fountain . Another savvy move worth the bucks-a premium shake roof on the folly , because it is seen every day from the house . To balance the cost , he gave the structure 's exterior an inexpensive stucco treatment . Using duct tape , Gavin formed rectangles over the initial rough coat and then pulled the tape off to reveal a pattern on the finished coat . The result : the look of high-dollar limestone blocks for a fraction of the cost .

" This effect is enhanced by the 16-foot vaulted ceiling . " The painted stud-frame interior , with 1920s-style diagonal 1x4 planking , lends a casual mood . A lover of candles , Lorie fills the little house with pillars and tapers , lighting them as friends arrive . The only other element needed to achieve perfection is good conversation , and in a setting such as this , that seems to come naturally .
