<p> Ga . 54 changes likes the seasons as it weaves through metro Atlanta 's Southside . <p> One minute it 's a winding stretch of quiet countryside in Coweta County . The next , it 's a neighborhood of well-kept homes in Fayette . Then , suddenly , it 's a hurly-burly retail strip in Clayton . <p> For all its mood swings , 54 is a very important road . It links six counties , starting in rural Troup near Alabama and snaking northeastward all the way to bustling Fulton County . <p> Now , two towns along the route want to redo sections of Ga . 54 where it cuts through their hearts . Peachtree City , in Fayette County , and Morrow , in Clayton , plan to make their busy corridors more attractive , productive and pedestrian-friendly . <p> But there 's a catch : Ga . 54 is a state highway that moves tens of thousands of vehicles per day . <p> Prettier roads are n't necessarily more efficient , and that 's where differences often arise between the Georgia Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metro Atlanta growing like a weed  --  it 's projected to add 2.3 million people by 2030  --  literally dozens of towns in the region will be laying plans in the coming years to redevelop corridors , such as 54 , that are worn out , underperforming or just plain ugly . <p> In the old days , the powerful state DOT would often decide internally how best to " upgrade " a state road , usually by widening it , and then do it  --  whether it was what the local community wanted . But those days are over . <p> City and county officials have become more knowledgeable about the impact of roadways on land use , and they are demanding a say in how their state roads are upgraded . And the federal government , which pays the lion 's share of most major road projects , has come to agree that local involvement is important . <p> Harold Linnenkohl sees those winds of change , and as the new head of the Georgia DOT , the last thing he wants is to turn the dozens of major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lose . <p> " The transportation system is choked down , and now we have to go in and fix it , " Linnenkohl says . " But we do n't want to put a heavy thumb on people . That wo n't work . " <p> What will work , he says , is a system rooted in two precepts : First , get all the stakeholders at the table at the start of the process ; and second , compromise . <p> That first is relatively easy . The second is where things get dicey . <p> Feisty Roswell says no <p> Roswell , north of Atlanta , has grown up in the past decade . It has morphed from a sleepy little suburb rooted in Civil War history into a vibrant and wealthy city of 85,000 people , with fine houses , an emerging arts scene and destination dining . <p> Amid all that growth and prosperity , however , lies a glaring piece of ugliness in the heart of the city , like a big pimple on the cheek of a runway fashion model . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging , nondescript strip shopping centers that are completely out of character with both its historic past and its present affluence . But Roswell has big plans to redevelop the corridor into a funky , tree-lined commercial village that is inviting to pedestrians and bicyclists . <p> But there 's a catch : The midtown redevelopment district runs along Alpharetta Street , which is a state highway and a main north-south artery . <p> When the Georgia DOT got wind of Roswell 's plans for the road  --  including lane narrowing to reduce traffic , tree plantings close to the curb , bicycle lanes and lovely brick crosswalks for pedestrians  --  the department 's chief engineer sent the city a curt letter stating that the plan would n't work on a stretch of arterial road that ferries 35,000 vehicles a day north to Forsyth County and south all the way to downtown Atlanta . <p> When many cities and towns get a letter like that , officials slump at their desks and schedule meetings to come up with a new plan . But not Roswell . <p> Metro Atlanta 's second-largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do n't like being pushed around . They responded to the GDOT 's letter by publicly ripping the agency  --  how dare they tell Roswell what it can and ca n't do along its vital midtown corridor ! <p> " GDOT comes in with their overkill plan , " says Lori Henry , a Roswell city councilwoman and head of the Redevelopment Task Force . " We 're saying no . " <p> And a lot of people are cheering them on . <p> Looking for compromise <p> " For decades , GDOT has been moving the long-distance traveler at the expense of local travelers , " says Christopher Leerssen , an urban designer with Tunnell-Spangler-Walsh in Atlanta . " So what we 've got are downtowns and neighborhoods that are subjugated to the interests of distance travelers . Roswell has been less willing to give up than most places . They 've been the most vocal opponent . It 's fantastic . " <p> The Atlanta Regional Commission , which was so impressed with Roswell 's midtown plan that it gave the city a $2.2 million Livable Centers Initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting at which the GDOT and Roswell made nice to each other , talked about compromise and got the project back on track . <p> But the lines were clearly drawn : Roswell was not going to let the GDOT determine what the city does with its midtown corridor , and the GDOT , under its new leadership , preferred not going to war over it . <p> That could help establish the pattern for growth strategies across metro Atlanta over the next quarter-century , experts say  --  especially in suburbs such as Roswell , which will evolve into urban centers as the metro region absorbs those 2.3 million more people . Ever-increasing limits on transportation options will lead to massive redevelopment of major corridors , town centers and so-called fringe cities that spring up near malls , they predict . <p> " We 'll have a hundred other places like Roswell in the Atlanta region over the next 20 or 30 years , " says Dan Reuter , who heads the ARC 's land use division . " We 're just trying to help Roswell and GDOT figure out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places . " <p> From Roswell 's perspective , the way to resolve it is for the GDOT to move away from its rigid old playbook on road construction . Specifically , the city wants a redevelopment plan for Alpharetta Street that prioritizes the community around it , not just the far-off feeder points . <p> That approach is known as " context-sensitive design " : roads that are designed , or redesigned , with the context of the surrounding community in mind . If you live in metro Atlanta , you 're going to hear that term a lot over the next two decades . <p> " I think it 's changing our industry , " Linnenkohl says . " With the growth we know is coming , the transportation solutions of 20 years ago are not going to work in the next 20 years . " <p> So Linnenkohl is engaging his staff in the effort , and decentralizing the GDOT to send more decision-making authority from headquarters in Atlanta out to the districts . <p> " There 's kind of a cultural shift that 's emerging within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local governments in shaping what these corridors look like , " says Al Outland , director of policy for the Georgia Municipal Association . <p> Changing ' a way of life ' <p> Everyone in the transportation and planning industries knows about context-sensitive design  --  several states are way ahead of Georgia in implementing it  --  but no two people seem to define it the same way . That 's a red flag . <p> Kathleen Field , director of community development for Roswell , sees context-sensitive design " changing the paradigm at GDOT . You consider the needs , the context . You do n't just plop down a freeway . " <p> Roswell 's position is that the needs of the community around Alpharetta Street require calming of traffic , adding crosswalks for pedestrians and beautifying it all  --  none of which would necessarily move vehicles any more efficiently and , in fact , might slow them down . <p> But that 's not what context-sensitive design means to Paul Mullins , the GDOT 's chief engineer and the man who sent the letter to Roswell . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mullins says . " The context from the neighbors is we 'd rather not have this traffic going through here , so let 's slow it down . That 's not context-sensitive design . That 's slowing down traffic . We have to reach a balance . " <p> Linnenkohl agrees with Mullins on that  --  a sign that change at the " new " GDOT will be gradual rather than radical . <p> " DOT is not accustomed to dealing with things out of the ordinary ; it 's hard for them to change , " says Larry Kaiser , Rockdale County 's engineering chief . " It will be a slow process . It 's a way of life we 're talking about changing . " <p> The key , planners and engineers agree , will be how communities deal with the GDOT , and when . There are two good examples on Ga . 54 . <p> Peachtree City 's plan <p> A couple of years ago , Peachtree City got wind of the GDOT 's plan to widen Ga . 54 where commuters from Coweta County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Rast and city engineer Troy Besseche got involved immediately , urging the GDOT to allow changes that would make the corridor more attractive and pedestrian-friendly . The department incorporated almost all their requests into the final plan . <p> " If you do n't ask , you 'll get a standard DOT look , " Besseche says . " We asked , early on . " <p> " Initially , there was a lot of hesitancy from GDOT  --  ' This is the way we do it , ' " Rast says . But both sides showed a willingness to compromise . " If there was something where they said ' absolutely not , ' we moved on and came up with something else . " <p> The Peachtree City project now is set to break ground . That 's not the case 20 miles to the northeast , along Ga . 54 in Morrow . <p> Clayton College &; State University , one of the Southside 's hidden jewels , is tucked behind the retail clatter that blares along 54 , from I-75 east to near the turnoff to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appeal of the rolling , heavily wooded campus and its jewel-like classical music venue , Spivey Hall , by turning the section of Ga . 54 that fronts the campus entryway into a mixed-use downtown . The city hired an architect and gave him the freedom to design something really cool . <p> " The architect was turned loose to come up with whatever plan he thought fit , " says Morrow City Manager John Lampl . " We let him do a lot of out-of-the-box thinking . " <p> The architect designed a grand roundabout , which would divert that part of Ga . 54 onto a circular gateway to both the college and the city . <p> The GDOT 's reaction : no way . <p> " I can understand the concerns about traffic tie-ups , " Lampl says in retrospect . " You might see where someone would come to the conclusion that this is not the road to practice on . " <p> Now , Lampl says , Morrow has a different firm working on a design , with strict guidelines built in , and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrow is not on the GDOT 's short-range radar . <p> Rockdale watches Roswell <p> The three-mile stretch of Salem Road in Rockdale County from I-20 south to the Newton County line is like a monument to bad planning . <p> The interstate highway spews 28,000 vehicles a day onto a clogged two-lane road along a significant growth corridor . Sitting in traffic , you get to gaze across an unending stretch of strip retail businesses : gas stations and fast-food joints everywhere . Flat , architecturally challenged strip centers . The obligatory tattoo parlor . Even some comic relief : a weight-loss clinic attached to a doughnut shop . <p> Charles Shanks ventures forth into this for the love of golf . There are two nice courses along the offending stretch of Salem Road , and Shanks , 56 , a manufacturer 's rep for General Motors , loves them both  --  so much that he actually considered moving to the area from DeKalb County . <p> " I was looking at a house just east of this strip , " Shanks says . " But I stayed too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the expressway made me rethink settling in the area . " <p> But Kaiser , the Rockdale engineer , has big plans for redeveloping that section of Salem Road . He envisions widening it to four lanes , using a context-sensitive approach , and reinventing the corridor with a mixture of small retail businesses , restaurants with outdoor seating and walkable residential centers . <p> But as usual , there 's a catch : Salem Road is a state highway and a major north-south corridor into Newton County . The state has plans for Salem Road as well , and they 're very different from Kaiser 's . The GDOT wants to turn it into a six-lane highway . <p> " Six lanes will wipe out everything , " Kaiser says . " The road is backed up all day , so we know that some widening is needed . But you do n't widen so much that you wipe out neighborhoods and make it unfriendly to pedestrians . " <p> Rockdale 's consultants are working on a Salem Road plan to present to the GDOT , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's dance with the department comes first and will speak volumes about the GDOT 's willingness to bend , Kaiser says . <p> ' An old guard ' <p> When it 's Rockdale 's turn , probably this summer , Kaiser will make his pitch for context-sensitive design based on two assumptions : One , if the county asks for extras , it will have to help pay for them ; and two , it wo n't happen unless the GDOT 's engineers buy into the new way of planning roads , either through education or mandates from the top . <p> " Anytime a government wants to do something nontraditional , Step One is to come up with some money , " Kaiser says . " Nontraditional roadwork costs more . Trees , streetlights , fancy traffic signals  --  all that stuff costs money . " <p> There 's also increased liability when a road is built that deviates from the old rule book , says Catherine Ross , director of Georgia Tech 's Center for Quality Growth and Regional Development . <p> " It means rethinking where some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local governments and the state , says Ross , who is working with the GDOT to formulate a set of guidelines for context-sensitive design . <p> But getting the GDOT engineers on board might be the bigger challenge . " These engineers are used to seeing it one way only , " Kaiser says . <p> Linnenkohl , himself a veteran engineer , agrees with Kaiser . <p> " At GDOT there is a brotherhood , an old guard , and we do have to be more flexible , " Linnenkohl says . " We 've got to realize that in today 's world we do not have the right to go in and destroy everything in the name of transportation . "
