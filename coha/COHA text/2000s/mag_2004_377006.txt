British health officials issued yet another warning about antidepressant drugs last week . The same authorities , citing increased risk of suicide , advised last year against giving so-called SSRIs  --  except Prozac  --  to youths under 18 . This time the counsel is aimed at adults . Doctors must now inform patients about withdrawal symptoms , such as anxiety and nausea , associated with SSRIs and closely monitor patients  --  especially young adults  --  for suicidal behavior when they begin drug treatment or change dosages . Doctors were also cautioned not to prescribe the drugs for mild depression without first trying talk therapy or other interventions . Finally , regulators issued a special warning about another kind of antidepressant , Effexor , saying it can cause irregular heartbeat and should be prescribed only by specialists .
