<p> Mark Overly does n't want you to drink bad coffee . <p> He really means it . <p> Overly , the owner of Kaladi Brothers Coffee in Denver , rarely sells coffee to restaurants - and they would like to buy his product - because he thinks kitchen staffs generally mangle everything to do with the brewing of a proper cup . He delivers fresh-roasted java to his many coffee-shop clients during the week so he can taste what the workers are doing to the beans he lovingly roasts , the beans he pampers with so much of his attention . <p> He sold his stake in the original Kaladi Brothers , which at the time was the largest roaster in Alaska , with cafes scattered around the state , " because I could n't take it anymore , " the " it " being what coffee-brewing bumblers committed upon his beans . <p> " Coffee is n't so much a thing as it is a process , " says Overly in the cramped space where he roasts coffee and holds " cuppings " - coffee tastings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " process " involves many steps , each one managed by different people . One bad move along the long route from field to counter , and the consumer 's cup of coffee can go from ambrosial to abysmal . <p> Overly is a coffee extremist . It might have been lonely five years ago , being such a curmudgeon about his caffeine . But no more . Coffee culture is inching its way out of the dairy-swamped cul-de-sac where it has languished for more than a decade , a place that hatched with the rise of corporate juggernauts pushing gigantic , sweet milk beverages spiked with roasted- long-ago espresso . <p> Boulder alone supports at least five roasters , which " in a town this size , that 's unheard of , " says Joel Edwards , the roaster for Sole Roasters in Boulder . At least another five roasters call Denver home . Altogether , the Front Range probably hosts nearly 20 roasters ; a decade ago , there probably were three or four . <p> Rocky Mountain water - it 's not just for beer ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another thing the Front Range has going for it , says Edwards , is its water . <p> " The water here is perfect for coffee , " he says . The minerals and the pH level in the glacial water , he says , are suited especially well for coffee . <p> The density of roasters , and the proliferation of coffee shops that offer detailed profiles of their coffees - and that intensely train their baristas to pull a righteous espresso - speaks to the so-called " Third Wave " of coffee appreciation , says Jess Aitken , the owner of Fluid Coffee Bar in Denver . <p> Local roasters , he says , deliver coffee as quickly as possible - sometimes , it 's just a matter of hours - to clients after the beans have gone from green to brown . And freshness is paramount . In addition , every roaster goes about its business in its own quirky way . Roasters use different machines . Roasters hew to different philosophies about their craft . Having a surfeit of local roasters brings not only fresh roast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all about the experience , " says Aitken , who was one of the first along the Front Range to buy a much- celebrated " Clover " coffee machine , a $12,000 device that brews cups one at a time and coffee connoisseurs covet . <p> The fancy machine wo n't work much magic on flawed coffee , though . That 's where Overly and the people at places like Sole Roasters materialize . They are the bean gatekeepers . If they know what they are doing , their clients will get excellent coffee . <p> The Sole Roasters people are serious about their joe . In their offices , in a light-industrial Boulder County office park , one area has been turned into the company 's " lab , " complete with different brewing contraptions , a tiered , round table with a revolving top used for " cuppings , " and closed-off slots along a wall where tasters can sit , sip and judge without being influenced by other tasters . The Sole Roasters owners are even thinking about installing special lights that drown out color in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beans they are smelling and sloshing across their tongues . <p> " Coffee is like wine , " says Noah Westby , a co-owner of Caffe Sole in South Boulder , which is affiliated with Sole Roasters . " Everybody has a different palate , everybody has different things they expect from a cup of coffee . " <p> What is a cupping ? <p> At Sole Roasters , it involves sniffing cups filled with freshly roasted and ground coffee , then filling the cups with hot water and letting the coffee steep for about three minutes . Most of the coffee sinks to the bottom of the cup , but some stays on top . Tasters then break the film of coffee , bring their noses to the cup , and sniff again . Whatever film of coffee remains is removed , and then , using deep spoons designed for coffee cupping , the coffee is slurped , briefly swished around and expelled into a spittoon . Notes are taken throughout and compared later . <p> Cuppings long have been part of the job for people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas , in Ethiopia or Sumatra , Colombia , Peru or Mexico . They cup samples of coffee , sent to them by brokers hoping to make a sale . They cup when they get shipments of coffee , to see if the stuff in sacks tastes as good as the java they ordered . <p> " It can mean big money , for the brokers , " says Westby . After a recent cupping of four Colombian coffees in the laboratory , everybody agreed that two of the coffees were in bad shape . One of the coffees approached excellence . And one emerged from the cupping victorious , a sample nearly electric with aromas and flavors of cherry and caramel . Sole Roasters will probably order about 20 sacks of the beans , which will come to about $6,600 . <p> " We get brokers who get mad at us , " he says . " They say , ' We always send you our samples , and you never pick our coffee . It costs us money . ' And we say , ' So ? " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wine tastings . But it 's now creeping into the mainstream . The Kitchen restaurant in Boulder , for example , now hosts cuppings . <p> Speaking " coffee " <p> The consumer education aspect of the coffee experience remains well behind what has captured wine and beer culture . People with even a mild interest in wine tend to have some idea how a pinot noir differs from a cabernet , or that " white " is a meaningless term , when you consider the differences between a German riesling and a classic California chardonnay . <p> Coffee ? It often means a latte , which essentially is a milk beverage ; or a cold slurry of milk , espresso and a sugary " flavoring " that is topped with whipped cream ; or a cup of something possibly brewed many hours ago and labeled " Guatemalan " or " Jamaica . " <p> " People come in and say , ' I want some coffee . What 's good ? " ' says Overly . " And I say , ' What do you like ? ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't have the vocabulary . " <p> If pushed , people often say they like " dark roast " coffee , which is the equivalent of saying you like " red " in a wine store , Overly says . <p> The " single-origin " approach to coffee , which focuses on compact regions , as opposed to entire nations , is increasingly popular , and it gives coffee more of a sense of place : not just Guatemalan , for example , but Guatemalan Antigua . Another term , " direct trade , " is in vogue , and it describes roasters who buy their beans directly from coffee farmers , instead of through broker intermediaries . <p> Sole Roasters embraces both concepts . <p> " The coffee is fresher , not having sat in an annex or some climate-controlled broker 's warehouse , " says Westby . " So freshness is higher . Also , you can really promote the farmer to the consumer . It makes it a more complete experience with that coffee . How many hands have touched that coffee ? As few as @ @ @ @ @
