If perchance , out of Mr. Goulart 's many novels ( most recent of which is Groucho Marx , Secret Agent , a book to be read whilst wearing elephant 's pajamas if ever there was one ) , you happened to read The Prisoner of Blackwood Castle or The Curse of the Obelisk , then you 've encountered Harry Challenge before . The Victorian ghostbuster has also been seen recently in Marvin Kaye 's anthology The Ultimate Halloween . Now he 's in our pages with a case of a now-you-see-it , now  --  you-do n't phantom . <p> IT WAS ON A RAW , WINDY afternoon in the spring of 1899 that Harry Challenge arrived in the capital city of the small Middle European country of Urbania . Before midnight he 'd narrowly avoid being crushed by a falling gargoyle , be threatened by an international female spy , and almost hurled off a train by a jealous circus strongman . He 'd initially gone there simply to investigate a ghost . Harry had been in Paris quietly diverting himself after apprehending a notorious band of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City caught up with him . Dear Son : Cease lollygagging in the fleshpots and hasten your dissipated carcass over to Urbania . Our client is Baron Westerman , who dwells in a castle a short train journey from St. Rolandsburg . This mutt thinks he 's being haunted by his wife 's ghost . Obviously we can take him for a bundle in fees . Your loving father , the Challenge International Detective Agency . Harry arrived at the huge , domed St. Rolandsburg Station at ten minutes after two in the afternoon . Within a few minutes more he and his single suitcase were inside a hansom cab heading for the opulent Hotel Pandora two miles away . He 'd been in Urbania twice before on agency cases and had long since decided that he liked it a good deal less than France . He was a lean , clean-shaven man of thirty-two , a bit above middle height . He wore , since his father believed it helped the image of the detective agency , a conservative dark business suit and a bowler hat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atop St. Roland Cathedral for several centuries . The cab rattled , then abruptly halted on the cobblestone street in front of the ancient towering cathedral . Harry , who 'd just lit one of the thin dark cigars he favored , glanced out the window . " This sure as hell is n't the hotel , " he observed . The door was politely tugged open by the driver . " Beg your pardon , sir , but one of the wheels is coming loose . " " And ? " The thin young man beckoned him to disembark . " If you 'll but wait on the sidewalk , sir , I 'll summon a new cab to convey - " Harry gathered up his suitcase and climbed out . " The Hotel Pandora 's less than a mile from here , " he said . " Just across the bridge . I can walk there before you - " " No , sir , my employers would be much angered if that happened . " He took hold of Harry 's arm , led him to the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry set his suitcase down . " Even so , I 'd rather hike . " " That would also reflect on me , sir . Here . " He produced , from behind his back , a bright yellow shawl and draped it over Harry 's shoulders . " This will protect you from the elements . " After taking a puff of his cigar , Harry said , " Okay , I 'll wait a few minutes . " " I 'm most appreciative , sir . " The youthful cabman took a step back , studied Harry and then moved forward again . He took hold of both Harry 's arms and moved him about a foot to the right . " A much more comfortable position , I believe . " Nodding , he returned to his hansom and , standing near his roan horse , began scanning the busy thoroughfare for a replacement cab to flag down . Harry took another puff of his cigar and glanced across the wide , cobblestone Cathedral Road toward the vast Prince Leopold Gardens . A slim young woman on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treelined lane , the skirt of her checkered traveling suit nipped at by the harsh afternoon wind . She suddenly stopped , waved her arms , and yelled , " Harry , look up ! " He did . Then he dived to his left , losing the bright yellow scarf , and hit the sidewalk . He went rolling over the pavement , dropped off the curb and into the gutter . The heavy stone gargoyle he 'd seen plummeting down toward him from high up on the cathedral smacked into sidewalk on exactly the spot where he 'd been standing . His suitcase was squashed flat . There was an immense smashing , crunching , and cracking , and dust came swirling up as jagged fragments of paving shot up all around . There was noise all about . People shouting , crying out , carriages and cabs rattling to stops , horses whinnying . A dog barked over in the park . Harry , feeling a mite wobbly , got to his feet . He brushed himself off swiftly and reached into his shoulder holster for his .38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atop the hansom , applying the whip to the roan horse . Before Harry had the gun out , the cab was clattering away in the direction of the bridge . " You 're not exceptionally bright , Harry , " said the pretty auburn  --  haired cyclist , who 'd walked her bicycle through the halted traffic and was approaching Harry . " Quite obviously that lout positioned you there so you - " " Thanks for the warning , Jennie . " He took hold of the handlebars of her bike . " Wait here until I get back and then we 'll exchange pleasantries . " " Surely you 're not going after that fellow and giving him another chance to kill you ? " Grinning , Harry commandeered the bicycle , hopped onto the seat and went pedaling off in pursuit of the fleeing assistant assassin . Harry caught up with the swaying hansom cab midway across the ornate wrought-iron bridge spanning the gray choppy waters of the River Konig . Increasing his speed , he pulled alongside and leaped free of the borrowed bicycle . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speeding cab . Jennie Barr 's cycle wobbled on riderless for a few yards more , then toppled over directly in the path of a heavy horse-drawn beer wagon . As Harry pulled himself up onto the roof of the hansom , the young driver rose up on his outside seat and swung at Harry with his whip . Harry dodged the flick of the lash , lunged and grabbed the driver by the front of his black greatcoat . " Who hired you to plant me there ? " " It was the merest coincidence , sir , " the youth told him . " My employers would never condone a sidewalk assassination . " " Who are you working for ? " asked Harry , shaking the driver . The young man wrenched free of Harry 's grip on him . Striking Harry across the chest with the handle of the whip , he twisted up out of his seat . He jumped free of the cab . As the driver hit the walkway at the side of the bridge , Harry grabbed the reins and shouted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . He was just in time to see the driver toss aside his greatcoat and dive off the bridge toward the river below . Harry sprinted to the ornamental , waist-high railing and looked down . He saw a coal barge and a red and gold houseboat steaming by down there , but there was nary a sign of the driver . " I do n't think I 'll pursue him any further , " Harry decided . The newly installed electric chandeliers added an extra sparkle to the crystal , silver , and crisp white tablecloths in the vast , crowded dining room of the Hotel Pandora . Harry rested an elbow on their table , watching Jennie Barr with his left eye narrowed . " Admittedly , Jennie , we 're close friends , even though we do n't encounter each other that often . But I do n't like to discuss current cases or - " " All right , " the young woman cut in , " do n't admit that we 're in St. Rolandsburg for the same dam reason . " " What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trail after me to get another sensation-ridden story for that yellow sheet that employs you . " " Hooey , " rejoined the auburn-haired reporter . " I arrived here two days before you , Harry . I was dispatched to investigate the rumors that the woods around Westerman Castle are haunted . As you know , I specialize in newspaper stories dealing with the weird and unusual . " On the small elevated bandstand , which was partially screened by potted palms , a formally attired string quartet was attempting Mozart . Harry tried his champagne . " Okay , you 're not tailing me , " he conceded . " And , again , thanks for warning me about the falling gargoyle . " Jennie sighed . " If somebody had planted me in such an obvious spot to have a huge piece of stoneware dumped on my head , I think I would 've had the common sense to look upward . " She pointed a finger at the high , stained glass ceiling of the restaurant , " Probably so . " " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavement where they wanted you to stand - or perhaps a bull's-eye , " said the reporter . " Honestly , Harry , I worry about these lapses of acumen that you display now and then . " " I was woolgathering , " he admitted . She shook her head . " Too bad you let that lout escape . " " Escape or drown , not sure which . " " And you did n't find anything when you climbed up into St. Roland 's ? " She assumed a guileless expression . " I found some local police and evidence that one of the gargoyles had been crowbarred from his longtime roost . " He tapped his forefinger against the stem of his glass . " You were up there before I was , were n't you ? " Jennie nodded , smiling . " While you were off ruining my rented bicycle , yes , " she acknowledged . " Ahead of the law , too . " " The agency will pay for the bike . Now what did you find ? " Extracting a leather-covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and opened it . Pressed between the pages was a yellow rose . " This was lying near the base of the absent gargoyle . Suggest anyone ? " He picked up the flower , frowning . " Damn , is she in Urbania ? " " Opening Friday at the Theatre Royale here in St. Rolandsburg . Offering arias from the great operas . " " He rubbed the yellow petals against his chin . " She 's very fond of yellow roses , " he said . " Lily Hope , second-rate singer and first-rate espionage agent for hire . " " It is n't the first time she 's tried to kill you . " " Actually it 's the fifth . " " Counting Cairo ? " " I 've never been certain that the poisoned dart was her work . " " Sure , it was . " He shrugged . " Six , then . The point is , why does a master spy want to do me in ? " " Settling old scores maybe . " " Nope , Lily 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake of his head . " She only tries to knock me off when I stand in the way of one of her enterprises . " Reaching across , Jennie took hold of his hand . " Did Baron Westerman hire you to investigate this ghost of his ? " " He did , yeah , " he answered . " And that 's the sole reason for my being in this benighted land . " " But why would Lily be interested in a ghost ? " " Could be she 's interested in the baron , " suggested Harry . " Although the dossier I put together on him does n't indicate any involvement with politics at all . Mostly he shoots game birds . " " He 's also rumored to be not too bright . " " You can be not too bright and still get into politics . No indications , though , that the baron is . " " What do you think about his ghost ? " " Nothing yet . That 's what I 'm here to investigate . " " His wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jennie . " If she is dead . " " Meaning ? " " The young lady , after having been married to the baron for not quite a year , disappeared one stormy midnight in the waters of a handy lake . She left a suicide note behind . " " And has n't been seen since . " " Except in ghostly form , or so some locals swear . " " Dead or alive , the Challenge international Detective Agency gets its fee . " " Yes , I know . " Jennie leaned back in her chair . " Are you taking the 11:15 to Westermanville tonight ? " " Planning to , yes . Are you ? " " No , Harry , I 'm booked to take the 10:00 A.M. tomorrow morning . " " Where are you staying ? " " At the St. Roland and the Dragon Inn . " " So am I. " He grinned . " We can have dinner tomorrow night . " " If I 'm not out solving the mystery . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Challenge . " A middle-aged bellboy in a goldtrimmed scarlet uniform was standing beside their table . A silver salver was held in his gloved left hand . " A message for you . " Harry dropped a gold coin on the plate , picked up the cream-colored envelope . " Well ? " inquired Jennie as he read the letter . " It says , " said Harry , clearing his throat , " ' You missed death this afternoon . Next time you wo n't . Return to Paris . " Unsigned . " She took the letter when he handed it across . After studying it for a moment , Jennie said , " This looks a heck of a lot like Lily Hope 's handwriting , does n't it ? " " Quite a bit , " he agreed . THE RAIN , accompanied by some impressive lightning and thunder , commenced minutes after Harry 's train pulled out of the station . Wind-driven rain whipped at the window of his compartment , the frequent flashes of bluish lightning illuminated the warehouses and stockyards on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vast pine forests . Harry initially had the compartment to himself . He was smoking one of his thin black cigars , watching the stormy night the train was roaring through . He had n't yet looked into the paper-covered Tauchnitz edition of the latest Anthony Hope novel that he 'd taken out of his new suitcase . It sat unopened on the seat next to him . " Beastly night . " The corridor door had come sliding open to admit the very large man in clerical garb who lunged into the swaying compartment . He thanked a large wicker picnic basket , which was overflowing with fat links of sausage and long loaves of dark bread , onto the seat across from Harry . Shaking himself , doglike , he scattered drops of rain around the swaying compartment . " Frightfully sorry if I 've spattered you , old man . " Harry , grinning thinly , said , " I 'm wondering how you got wet , since it was n't raining when the train pulled out . " Taking off his wide-brimmed priestly hat and tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed a thumb at the ceiling . " I was up on the roof for a bit . " " Oh . so ? " " I often travel in such a manner when I 'm on a mission , " he explained . " Though not usually in such deucedly foul weather . " He gave an appreciative nod . " You 're a clever and perceptive fellow , Challenge . " Eyeing him , Harry said , " I take it you have n't dropped in to convert me to your faith . " " I 'm a bit of an agnostic actually , old man . I toyed with Muscular Christianity for a spell , eventually found it dashed unsatisfying . " " I have the feeling that I 've seen you before , " said Harry , exhaling smoke . " I think it was at a circus in Budapest . You were the strongman . " Smiling briefly , he answered , " Yes , old man , I was known as the Mighty Orloff . " " You lifted a cow over your head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even more impressive , " said Harry . " And are you the fellow who pried the gargoyle off St. Roland 's earlier in the day ? " Harry took a long drag on his cigar , causing the tip to sparkle redly . The spurious clergyman nodded , accepting responsibility . " We would have got you if that intrusive newspaper girl had n't spoiled things . " " We being you and Lily Hope ? " The big man nodded again , scowled . " I 'll tell you , dear chap , I also happen to have a personal grievance against you . " Taking another puff on his cigar , Harry said nothing . " Damme , if I do n't suspect that Lily 's sweet on you . " " That most recent token of her affection does n't suggest an overwhelming passion for me . " " The dear lady was , to my eye , almost pleased that you 'd escaped being squashed , " he said . " Made me devilishly jealous for a bit , I must say . So that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be , as it were , killing two birds with one stone . " Harry pointed out , " Since Lily 's dispatched you to try again , she ca n't be harboring too much in the way of fond feelings for me . " " I 'm blessed if I do n't suspect she 'd be pleased if I failed to kill you . " " Why exactly are you and Lily interested in the ghost of Valeria Westerman ? " " We 're not , old boy . We 're interested in her romantic entanglements , " replied Orloff . " And now let us get down to ... Oof ! " Harry had all at once flicked his burning cigar into the would-be assassin 's face . The lit end hit him smack between the eyes , scattering sparks . When the erstwhile strongman brought up his hands to rub at his eyes , Harry raised up partially to deliver a substantial kick into his groin . The big man howled , stumbled backward , sat on his picnic basket , snapping a loaf of bread in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harry . Then he stopped . Harry had his .38 revolver in his hand , aimed at the strongman 's midsection . " Let 's chat about what you and dear Lily are really up to , old man , " he suggested . " I shall never betray her . " " Would a few bullets in various parts of your body persuade you to modify that stand ? " " Never ! " He suddenly grabbed up the basket and flung it straight at Harry . Hit in the chest with the heavy assortment of comestibles , plus two bottles of cheap red wine , Harry stumbled backward and landed on the seat . Orloff yanked open the inside door , went running along the swaying corridor . Disentangling himself from the picnic fare , Harry , gun in hand , dived out of the compartment . Orloff was at the end of the car . As the train slowed around a curve , he stepped into the passway between cars . When Harry reached the passway , he found that the door to the outside was flapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train out into the rainswept woodlands beyond . Reaching out and tugging the door shut , Harry observed , " I guess you should never underestimate a strongman . " IT WAS ABOUT ten minutes shy of one A.M. that evening when Harry got his first glimpse of the ghost . The carriage from the inn was carrying him from the train station along a quirky road that passed through a dark forest . The rain continued heavy ; thunder rumbled off among the trees . Then there was a great , crackling flash of lightning off to the right of the speeding carriage . Harry turned toward it as the forest was briefly illuminated . " Damn , there she is ! " He saw , lit up by the lightning , a heavy white cloak over the slender shoulders of the misty , insubstantial figure of an otherwise unclothed young woman . She was walking , slowly and stiffly , along a woodland path some hundred feet in from the roadway . Thrusting his head out of the coach window , Harry shouted , " Stop this contraption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Witchwood after dark , sir . 11 He cracked his whip . The two horses increased their speed . Twisting on his seat , Harry looked back . The forest was dark again . He decided not to jump from the fast-moving carriage . Frowning , he leaned back and lit a fresh cigar . " Pack of superstitious louts , do n't you know , " observed Captain Amos Waverly . " Entire blooming country is that way . Worse than bloody England when it comes to giving credence to old wives " tales . Toby there 's smarter than the whole and entire populace of Urbania . " Toby was the small pugnacious bulldog who was gnawing diligently at Harry 's left boot , backside wiggling , low growls sounding deep in his gray chest . " Shoo , " suggested Harry , again turning his attention to signing the St. Roland &; the Dragon register . The captain , apparently the proprietor of the inn , was a large , heavyset man in his early sixties . Bald , bewhiskered , and pink , he was wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy-striped flannel nightshirt . He was leaning on Harry 's side of the registration desk , a knobby cane in his hand and his right foot swathed in considerable windings of bandages . " Toby , my lad , abandon our guest 's foot , do you hear . " Toby ignored him , growling more fervently . Harry said , " You do n't believe Witchwood is haunted ? " " Haunted , my aunt , " said the captain . " No such thing as spooks , old chap . " " What , in your opinion , have folks been seeing in the woods of an evening lately ? " " Same thing you saw . " The captain leaned , tapping the bulldog gently on the backside with the tip of his cane . " Suspend your unseemly behavior , Toby . No doubt , Challenge , you sighted a wandering guest from that decadent artist 's hideaway . " " Which artist ? " Bending , Harry plucked the bulldog off his foot , holding him by his studded collar . " Begone or face extinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooring , went waddling off to sprawl in front of the stone fireplace . " Now that 's the way to handle Toby . Firmly , no nonsense , " said the captain approvingly . " Far too many mollycoddles in the world today . Especially in Urbania . Thought it was bad in England , moved here , found it far worse , I must say . " " Which decadent artist ? " " One of these bright chaps , Dr. Owen Rumsford , " replied Captain Waverly . " Been occupying Milverton Manor for close to a bloody year . Far too modern in his outlook , paints loathsome pictures of unclothed women , indulges in strange drugs , is possibly a vivisectionist and , so I hear - and you can never completely trust the word of the local nitwits - stages nocturnal orgies on the premises with alarming frequency . You no doubt glimpsed some drink-crazed creature stumbling about the woods near the manor house in a disgraceful state of dishabille . " " She looked , during the brief glimpse I caught , much too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , shaking his head . " So Dr. Rumsford lives hereabouts , huh ? " " You 've heard of the scoundrel ? " " Yeah , in addition to being a noted painter , he has a considerable reputation as a scientist , " answered Harry . " An unorthodox scientist . " " That 's Rumsford , to be sure . Decidedly unorthodox . " The innkeeper yawned . " Now then , Challenge , let me hobble upstairs , as best I can though suffering from this blasted gout , and show you to your room . You remain below , Toby . " Stretching to his feet , the bulldog followed them up the shadowy staircase . Baron Westerman spoke English with a slight Urbanian accent . " There , Herr Challenge , is my dear departed Valeria , " he said , gesturing at the unfinished painting resting on the easel at the exact center of the cluttered drawing room . The portrait showed a slim blonde young woman with long , curly PreRaphaelite hair . She was perhaps twenty-five , wearing an off-the-shoulder white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped just above her waist . The lower third of the canvas was , except for some preliminary pencilling , blank white . " A very handsome young lady . " Harry made his way over to the painting , skirting a clawfooted table that had a stuffed marsh hawk perched on a stand atop it . " Ah , yes , well might you emphasize the word young , Herr Challenge , since I am much older than poor - " " I did n't , actually . " He studied the portrait for a few silent seconds . " This was painted by your neighbor , Owen Rumsford , was n't it ? " " That blackguard , " muttered the short , amply bearded baron . " When he first moved into Milverton Manor , I knew only his considerable reputation as a portrait painter . " He sighed , reaching over to ruffle the feathers upon the head of a stuffed grouse perched on an oaken sideboard . " I had yet to learn that Rumsford was an immoral reprobate who lived a licentious life and dabbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officially ranked as one of the black arts . " Turning away from the unfinished portrait of the dead woman , Harry crossed to one of the French windows . The early afternoon sky outside was gray ; a flock of ravens came fluttering down to land on the misty lawn of the formal garden that stretched away from the mansion . " Be that as it may , " said Baron Westerman , jamming his small fists down deep into the pockets of his velvet smoking jacket . " Once I was apprised of Rumsford 's true nature , I banished him from my home . " Harry turned to face his client . " How soon after that did your wife disappear ? . " " Valeria did not disappear , Herr Challenge , " corrected the baron . " The poor child threw herself into the waters of Lake Nebel . I showed you the suicide note she left neatly folded up with all her garments beside its dark waters . She simply said that she was too unhappy to go on living . " He pointed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my estate . " " Cold , jumping into a lake naked . " Harry took out a thin cigar . " You say you had the lake dragged ? " " Yes , but it 's very deep and no trace of poor Valeria was ever found . " The baron wiped at the corner of his eye with his thumb knuckle , sniffling . " What bothers me now , now that I 've accepted the grim fact that she is no longer alive , is that her perturbed spirit must wander the woods bordering my estate . " " Bordering Dr. Rumsford 's place , too . " Westerman sighed once more . " I want you - which your estimable father assures me you are fully capable of doing , Herr Challenge - to confront my late wife 's restless ghost . You must make certain that she is freed from this earthly realm and goes on to her reward in Heaven " Lighting his cigar with a wax match , Harry asked , " Have you seen her yourself ? " Commencing to sob quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herr Challenge , yet I can not bring myself to venture into Witchwood by night . Seeing my poor departed Valeria in spirit form would be too much to bear . " " But you 're certain it 's she ? " " I 've had descriptions - from some of my tenants and from the village postman who was returning from a nocturnal visit to his fiancee , " the baron replied . " Yes , I believe that the spirit of my dead wife has come back to haunt me . " " She 'd have a better chance of doing that if she showed up some place inside the house here . " He nodded toward the misty garden . " Or right outside . Your garden would make a fine site for a haunting . " Frowning deeply , the baron asked . " What are you suggesting , sir ? " Harry shrugged , exhaling smoke . " Merely being curious , " he answered . " Does she appear every night ? " " There seems to be no regular pattern to her materializations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's showed up three nights in a row and then missed a week . " " And she usually shows up around midnight , " said Harry . " Okay , I 'll start roaming Witchwood every night until I spot her . " " Please , do n't harm Valeria . Do n't put any spells on her that will doom her to eternal damnation or - " " I 'm a detective , " reminded Harry . " Very few spells do I cast . " Nodding , the baron invited , " If you 're intending to enter the woods this evening , Herr Challenge , might I suggest that you stop by here for a late dinner beforehand ? " " Not this evening , baron , " he said . " I already have a dinner engagement . " HARRY WAS ADJUSTING his shoulder holster when someone knocked on the oaken door of his beam  --  ceilinged room . It was a foggy night and thick gray mist pressed against the leaded windows . Putting on his coat , Harry said , " Yeah ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the innkeeper . " Accompanied by the faithful Toby . " Moving to the door , Harry opened it . " Any word from Jennie Barr ? " The captain gave a forlorn shake of his head . " The young lady , alas , has still not returned from her early afternoon stroll , " he answered . " Though an optimist , I must admit that I am growing increasingly concerned . " " So am I. " When Harry returned from his client 's estate , he 'd learned that Jennie had arrived at St. Roland &; the Dragon , signed in and , after freshening up , gone out . She 'd left a note for Harry telling him she was expecting to join him for dinner . The captain she had told she was going to take a stroll in the woodlands . The day had ended , night had closed in , but Jennie had not returned to the inn . It was now a few minutes short of eight . " Perhaps a search party is in order , " suggested Captain Waverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an activity , more 's the pity , but I can volunteer my stable boy and - " " I 'll find her . " Buttoning his coat , Harry stepped out into the corridor . Toby growled by way of greeting him . " Keep in mind , my dear Challenge , that Witchwood by night can be a dangerous place . " " Nevertheless . " He shut his room door , headed for the shadowy stairway . " Allow me to loan you the services of the staunch Toby . " " For what - company ? " " You 'll find him an excellent tracker . Although his scrunched up little nose does n't look all that impressive , I can assure you that - " " All right , if he promises not to bite me , " Harry conceded . " And we 'll need something that belongs to Jennie , for the scent . " " I 've already thought of that . " From a pocket of his ample Norfolk jacket , the captain removed a plaid scarf . " Took the liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . " " That 'll do . " Somewhat gingerly , Harry held the scarf near the bulldog 's nose . " This is who we 're hunting for , Toby . " After sniffing thoughtfully , Toby made a brief attempt to nip Harry 's fingers . " Merely being playful , " explained the innkeeper . " I 'm expecting you to accomplish your mission , Toby . " A few moments later , Harry , carrying a bull's-eye lantern , was following the bulldog into the woods beyond the inn . Less than a minute after a distant bell tower struck eleven , Harry saw the ghost again . So did Toby , who commenced barking . " Hush , " Harry advised the dog . About sixty feet away , on a narrow trail that ran parallel to the one along which the sniffing bulldog had been leading Harry , the blurred figure of a woman could be seen . Draped over her shoulders was the long white cloak . What could be seen of her naked body seemed transparent ; only the coating beads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a ghost , " realized Harry . " No , somehow - and I 'm going to have to find out how - she 's become invisible . If she were n't splotched with fog , you would n't see anything but that damned cloak . " He was about to start pushing his way through the misty brush and trees that separated him from the stiffly walking young woman . But then Toby spun suddenly around , alternating between barking and growling . Harry never got to see what the object of the dog 's agitation was . As he started to turn , someone conked him on the back of the head . Twice again with something heavy and metallic . He heard the dog yelp once before he fell forward , lost consciousness , and was surrounded by mist . Harry awoke to find a bare female foot floating a yard or so from him . He himself , thoroughly trussed up with thick hempen rope , was sprawled , face down , amidst old straw on the dirt floor of what had once been a cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed a second foot floating near the other one . Both of them looked as though they belonged to a young woman , a well-groomed , upper class young woman . " Since you 're groaning , Harry , I assume you 're awakening , " observed a familiar voice to his left . " I rarely groan , " he said , lifting his head and twisting to the left , " except while reading one of your newspaper yams . " Jennie Barr , wearing a rumpled plaid traveling suit , was tied to a straight-back wooden chair that sat on the barn floor about ten feet from him . The large hollow structure was lit only by a kerosene lantern that dangled from a nearby stanchion . The reporter 's auburn hair was tangled and there were smudges of dirt on her face . She said , " This is n't the place for literary criticism , Harry . What we " You 're a reporter ? Good heavens , had I known that I would never have confided in you . " The voice came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that there was a second bentwood chair sitting there . Ropes floated , apparently holding an unseen young woman in place . " You must be Valeria Westerman , " said Harry , " alleged ghost . " " That she is , " confirmed Jennie . " They brought her in along with you , only she was n't out cold . We 've been passing the time chatting while waiting for you to come out of your stupor . Although , as I explained to Valeria , it 's sometimes difficult to tell your stupor from your normal - " " I 've committed another serious error , " said the unhappy invisible woman . " I should never have told you all I did , except that I supposed you , like myself , were no more than a hapless prisoner of these fiends . " " I 'm a reporter , sure , but I 'm as hapless as you . " " Which specific fiends are we talking about ? " inquired Harry . " Would that be Lily Hope and the Mighty Orloff ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught me snooping around this abandoned farm earlier in the day and tossed me in here , yes . If Orloff is a big muscle-bound oaf , then he 's the other fiend . " Harry nodded as best he could toward the slowly materializing young woman . " I take it , Baroness , that you ran off to join Owen Rumsford after faking your suicide . " " I have no further comments to make , " said the nearly invisible woman . " Who are you , may I ask , another prying journalist ? " " A detective , hired by your husband . " She sighed . " This grows more hopeless by the moment , " Valeria said forlornly . " My shame will be made known to the world through the pages of a yellow journal and then my dull , tedious , bird-obsessed husband will discover that I 'm not dead at all and drag me back to that taxidermyinfested pile . " " None of that , " Harry pointed out , " is going to happen unless we get free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why the lady 's invisible ? " " Is my shame to be broadcast far and wide ? " " Only to Harry just now , Baroness . " Harry hunched his shoulders , flexed his hands . " Rumsford is a maverick scientist , greatly interested in coming up with weapons and gimmicks that can be sold for use in the many wars and skirmishes now taking place around the world . In the past he 's made more money from that sideline than he has from his paintings . " " Well , you 're not as dense as usual , " said Jennie with a touch of admiration in her voice . " You would n't be as fond of me as you are if I were actually dense . " He shifted his position on the bovine-scented straw , bringing his knees up as far as the ropes would allow . " I figure Rumsford is working on a formula to make soldiers - and maybe spies - invisible . To test his invention , he tried it out on Valeria here . Though I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman wander in the woods by night . " " She sleepwalks , " provided Jennie . " He tries to keep her locked up at home nights , but when he gets distracted by his laboratory work or his painting , he forgets . Valeria tosses a cloak over her invisible shoulders and wanders around Witchwood until she wakes up . " Harry spoke in the direction of the floating feet . " Why exactly did you let Rumsford experiment on you , ma'am ? " " He 's a very seductive , very persuasive fellow . " The fingers of her left hand were now also visible . " And , of course , he convinced me this was a humanitarian experiment and had nothing to do with any ongoing conflict . I dearly wish I 'd never fallen under his spell . " Jennie mentioned , " Apparently you do n't stay invisible all the time . " " No , that 's what has necessitated Owen 's injecting me repeatedly in the backside with his vile potion . I found out that he ca n't sell his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep a user safely invisible for at least ten hours . So far I 've never remained unseen for more than five . " " Lily , I imagine , knowing Rumsford 's reputation , guessed what the ghost of Witchwood really was , " said Harry , rolling to the right . " She came out here , grabbed Valeria and plans to trade her back to Rumsford in exchange for this invisibility formula . " " I fear , " said the young woman , " that he no longer values me that much . " Jennie frowned down at the writhing Harry . " Whatever are you doing ? " " It 's a trick my magician friend the Great Lorenzo tried to teach me once , " he replied . " He calls it the Marvelous Escape Trick in his traveling magic show . " " Did he succeed in teaching it to you ? " " We 'll see . " " How is Lorenzo ? " " When I last had a cablegram from him , he was playing in the capital city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my distant homeland , " she said . " Would that I were safely back there and free of both the Baron and Owen Rumsford . " Harry grunted , straining at the thick ropes . Then he said , " I might be able to arrange that if - " " Good news ! " Orloff , dressed in an Inverness overcoat , had stepped into the barn from out of the misty night . " Lily , after considerable cajoling on my part , has consented to allow me to sink you in Lake Nebel , Challenge . " " That is good news , yeah , " said Harry . THE MIGHTY ORLOFF 'S boots crunched on the shale beach that bordered the mist-shrouded Lake Nebel . Unseen night birds were hooting in the dark forest they 'd just passed through . Slung over the former strongman 's broad shoulder , Harry remarked , " For a fellow who once lifted a full-grown cow over his head , you 're sure huffing and puffing . " " It was a bull , " the big , wide man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and writhing does n't make carrying you down to the lake all that easy . " " The thought of my impending death gives me the fidgets . " " That will cease once I fill your various pockets with heavy stones and shot-put you into your watery grave , Challenge . " " I 'm curious , " said the restless Harry . " As to how deep the lake might be ? The guidebooks inform us that Lake Nebel is close to bottomless . Not that the fact will make any difference to - " " No , about whether Dr. Rumsford has agreed to trade his invisibility formula for the safe return of Valeria . " Orloff halted , still about ten yards from the waters of the night lake . " How the devil did you come to know about that ? " " I 'm a detective , " he reminded the strongman . " That 's most interesting , that is . Lily has assured me on more than one occasion that you are n't as simple as you appear , yet I failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed her schoolgirl affection for you simply clouded her judgment . " Harry persisted . " Is Rumsford going to make the trade ? " Orloff made a resigned noise . " This very night at one A.M. in the old barn , " he said . " The doctor will hand over his notebooks and his entire supply of the invisibility potion . " He took two steps forward . " We have several interested potential clients among the major nations . As to what we 'll eventually do with the petite Miss Barr , we have n't as yet - " " It does work , " announced Harry . " What works , old man ? " " My friend Lorenzo 's rope escape trick . " Harry , shedding his bonds , dropped to the beach . Scooping up a large stone , he reached up and smacked Orloff across the temple with it several times . The strongman collapsed on the shale . The barn was on fire . Harry saw the flames while he was still hurrying back through the misty forest . He started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old structure was afire , flames crackling and climbing up into the night . Smoke was swirling , mixing with the fog . He was trotting past the rundown farmhouse when someone hailed him . " I advise you to stop , Harry dear . " Halting , he turned to see Lily Hope stepping out from behind a gnarled tree . She held what looked to be a filigreed dueling pistol in her gloved hand . The flames from the burning barn two hundred feet away made its barrel sparkle . She was a handsome woman , about Harry 's age and ten pounds heavier than when he 'd last encountered her . Lily wore a long dark velvet cloak over her scarlet gown and her currently blonde hair was piled high on her head and was studded with quite a few glistening diamonds . " Do n't have time for a chat , Lily . There are two women in that damn barn , " " Yes , is n't that rather a pity . " " I 'm going in after them . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lantern in her hopeless struggles , " said the international spy and soprano . " I was dozing when I became aware of the conflagration . " " You need the baroness and she 's in there , too . " Lily shrugged . " We can simply waylay dear Dr. Rumsford while he 's on his way here , " she said . " In a way , Harry , it 's much simpler and cleaner if Valeria is dead . " " Like hell . " He spun , started running again . " I 'll shoot you , Harry . You must n't doubt that . " He continued to run , closing the distance between himself and the barn . " I shall count to three , " Lily called . " If you do n't halt , I 'll shoot you in your handsome back . " He was almost to the entrance to the flaming building . " One . " He reached the threshold . " Two . " Just as he was about to enter the smoke-filled barn someone off in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have to go in there . " Harry stepped back , staring into the mist at his left . " We got out , " said Jennie . " But I knocked over the dam lantern when I tipped my chair over to smash it and loosen the ropes . " " How 's Valeria ? " " Right here hunkered down with me , and about fifty-sixty percent visible now . We were about to go looking for you when I heard you come lumbering through the woods . " " Three , " announced Lily , striding over to where Harry was standing . " Ah , your little reporter and the baroness have escaped . Do n't make an attempt to flee , any of you . " " I wonder , " put in Valeria , who was huddled behind the now-standing Jennie , " if I might borrow your cloak , Miss Hope . My visibility is now nearly total and I 'm naked . " " All of you come away from this potential inferno and back to the farmhouse , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Easing out of his coat , Harry handed it toward the nearly visible baroness , eyes averted . " I saw you sing once in the opera house in the capital of Graustark , " said Valeria , shivering in spite of the donated coat and increasing heat from the burning barn . " I must say , Miss Hope , that you seemed far more amiable upon the stage than you do tonight . " " A dreadful old pile , your ramshackle opera house . " Lily backed away from the barn , beckoning them with the pistol to come along . " By the way , " said Harry as they began marching toward the old house , " you 've probably realized that Orloff did n't succeed in sinking me in the picturesque waters of Lake Nebel . " " So that 's why you 're running around loose . " She stopped , frowning at him . " I gave no such order . " " So you are still fond of me . " " Not at all , Harry , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you do to Orloff ? " " Slugged him , tied him up with the ropes he 'd used on me . He 's slumbering beside the lake and you - " An angry growling interrupted Harry . From out of the surrounding mist came Toby . He dived at one of Lily 's plump ankles and sank his teeth into it . She cried out in pain . " You nasty little beast , " she said , twisting to aim the gun at the snarling bulldog . Stepping forward , Harry socked her on the chin . As Lily slumped , passing out , he extracted the pistol from her slack fingers . " Ungentlemanly , " observed Valeria . " Yet most effective , Herr Challenge . " " Yes , that was very helpful , Harry , " added Jennie . " Who 's the hound ? " Bending , Harry took hold of the dog and pulled him away from the fallen spy 's boot . " This is Toby from the inn . I was wondering what had become of him . " Valeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that I 'm free I must either return to my annoyingly mundane husband or resume being an increasingly reluctant guinea pig for Owen Rumsford . " " Not necessarily , 11 Harry told her . THERE WAS A DIFFERENT string quartet playing in the immense dining room of the Hotel Pandora . But their grasp of Mozart was only a shade better than that of their predecessors . Since it was early evening , the place was only partially filled . The fashionable citizens of St. Rolandsburg rarely dined before ten . Jennie , wearing yet another checkered traveling suit , clinked her champagne glass against Harry 's , grinning . " You really possess very little in the way of integrity . " " On the contrary , I 'm actually almost noble in my dealings - with the world . " " You completely failed in your handling of Baron Westerman 's case , " the reporter pointed out . " You collected your enormous fee , however , and lied to the old boy as - " " I did exactly what he paid us for , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop appearing in the woodlands surrounding his estate . She did . Nobody 's seen her since . " " That 's because you allowed Valeria to slip away to head back home to Graustark . " Harry nodded . " I decided she did n't belong with either of the gents in the case . " " Sometimes , " admitted Jennie , " I admire your sentimental side . " Sipping his champagne , Harry said nothing . " You handled Dr. Rumsford well , too , " she continued . " Taking his notebooks and samples from him when he showed up for the expected exchange , then sinking everything in Lake Nebel . " " He 'll probably start fooling with invisibility again . At least I 've slowed him down some . " " I 'm not as pleased over the fact that you let Lily Hope and that circus refugee escape . " Harry held up his hand in a stop-right-there gesture . " Lily , clever woman that she is , managed to get free of that shed I 'd locked her in while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , as you 'll recall , when we reached the lake all we found were the ropes I 'd used to truss up Orloff . " " Sure , he probably knows Lorenzo 's rope trick , too . " Jennie set down her glass . " Of course , I ca n't file a story about the ghost at all . Not and tell the truth . " " You have a sentimental side yourself . " " Matter of fact , I do , " said Jennie . " When we worked together in Paris a couple of years ago , we were .. well , quite friendly . " " We were , " Harry agreed . She said , " St. Rolandsburg is n't Paris , but ......
