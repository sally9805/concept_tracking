Chapter One Ashley The first day of school is a mixture of Christmas and a trip to the dentist . You want everyone to see your new clothes and you want to see your old friends and catch up on what 's gone on over the summer , but there 's also dread for what your teachers have in store . The air is filled with the smell of fresh denim , sharpened pencils , and newly cleaned hallways . Immaculate backpacks swing behind pixies ( our term for sixth graders ) , and you can almost feel their fear as they face their next three years . Will the year be exciting ? Will you get into the subjects and lose yourself , or will it be an educational root canal ? I 've had both experiences . At least I had my twin brother to walk through the whole thing with me . His name is Bryce . We moved from Chicago a few years ago with our mom . Our dad died in a plane crash and she got remarried to Sam , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was n't my first choice , but I guess that 's life . We have a little brother , Dylan , and a big stepsister , Leigh . That Thursday morning , Leigh walked toward the bus stop with a face longer than a horse 's . She 'd been saving all summer to buy a car , and the long face was because she had to climb onto the yellow monster . She says there 's nothing more humiliating than being a senior and riding the bus . Watching Bryce and me zoom away on our ATVs probably did n't help . We motored to Mrs. Watson 's barn , just across from the school . Eighth grade makes us kings and queens . No one older to bully us , and everyone younger looks up to us-or should . Other than our senior year in high school , this is the last time we 'll have this feeling . It felt like a long time since we had walked these halls . Summer is always too short , and ours had been full of adventure and mystery . Part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw my friend Hayley near my locker and we hugged . Bryce rolled his eyes and moved to first period . Marion Quidley waved and smiled . I 'd come to know her a little better the past few weeks . Duncan Swift tossed a football to Chuck Burly , and it bounced off Chuck 's chin . Duncan is probably the best athlete and cutest guy in the school , but he does n't pay much attention to me . One of the best things about the first day is that teachers do n't expect to accomplish much . You get your books , find out a little about your teachers and classmates , and go home . No big whoop . I had great hopes for the year . I did n't see how anything could possibly go wrong , especially the first day . But as soon as I stepped into Mrs. Sanchez 's Spanish class , I thought I was going to throw up . Standing at the back window was none other than the school bully from last year , Boo Heckler .

I looked forward to the season , which starts in January . I 'd never been a teacher 's aide , but it seemed fun . Mr. Gminski said I 'd grade papers and be a gofer ( go for this and go for that ) , or when there was nothing to do I could sack out behind his desk in the reading room . The sixth graders filed in like lemmings jumping off a cliff . The guys all tried to look cool , strutting but laughing nervously . They looked so little that they reminded me of my brother , Dylan . It was his first day in kindergarten , and I could n't wait to hear about that . The bell rang and Mr. Gminski sauntered in . Short and stocky , he looks like a football linebacker with broad shoulders and a head too small for his neck . Reminds me of one of the comedians my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black suit . Mr. Gminski told the class about where he 'd taught before and what they 'd do this year . Then he introduced me and asked me to call the roll and guess how to say all the names . But the intercom squawked , and the school secretary asked me to report to the front office . " Uh-oh , " one of the kids said . ( Continues ... )
