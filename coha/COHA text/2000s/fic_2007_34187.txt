Preface Claudia Modjeski stood before a full-length mirror in the bedroom she 'd inherited from her mother , pointing the gun in her right hand  --  a Colt .44 Single Action Army with a nickel finish and a walnut grip  --  at her reflected image . The mirror showed nothing above Claudia 's shoulders , because the designation ' full-length ' turned out to be as arbitrary as ' one-size . ' It may have fit plenty , but it did n't fit her . The .44 was a collector 's gun , a cowboy 's gun purchased at a weapons show she 'd attended with Hazel Hunnicutt last Christmas , without bothering to explain to Hazel ( or to herself ) why she thought she needed it . She sat down heavily on the end of her mother 's bed . Ludie Modjeski 's bed , in Ludie 's room . The gun rested in Claudia 's slack hand . She had put it away the night before because eliminating the specificity that was Claudia meant erasing all that remained of her mother in this world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , and the hard candies Ludie used to make each year . There were peppermint ribbons , pink with white stripes . There were spearmint trees and horehound drops covered with sugar crystals . The recipes , the choreography of her mother 's steps across the kitchen , an infinity of momentsremembered only by her daughter , those too would die . But tonight she would put the gun back in its case because of the headless cowboy she 'd seen in the mirror . Her pajama bottoms had come from the estate of an old man ; the top snap had broken , so they were being held closed with a safety pin . The cuffs fell a good two inches above her shins , and when she sat down the washed-thin flannel rode up so vigorously , her revealed legs looked as shocked and naked as refugees from a flash flood . In place of a pajama top , she wore a blue chenille sweater so large that had it been unraveled , there would have been enough yarn to fashion into a yurt . Claudia had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , hidden laugh in her voice , Poor old thing , and was n't it the truth , which did n't make living any easier . The Colt had no safety mechanism , other than the traditional way it was loaded : a bullet in the first chamber , second chamber empty , four more bullets . Always five , never six . She put the gun away , listened to the radiators throughout the house click and sigh and generally give up their heat with reluctance . But give up they did , and so did Claudia , at least for one more night , this December 15 . Rebekah Shook lay uneasy in the house of her father , Vernon , in an old part of town , the place farmers moved after the banks had foreclosed and the factories were still hiring . She slept like a foreign traveler in a room too small for the giants of her past : the songs , the language , the native dress . Awake , she rarely understood where she was or what she was doing or if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featureless , pastel landscape that undulated beneath her feet . She looked for her mother , Ruth , who ( like Ludie ) was dead and gone and could not be conjured ; she searched for her family , the triangle of herself and her parents . There were tones that never rang clear , distant lights that were never fully lit and never entirely extinguished . She remembered she had taken a lover , but had not seen him in twenty-eight ... no , thirty-one days . Thirty-one days was either no time at all or quite long indeed , and to try to determine which she woke herself up and began counting , then drifted off again and lost her place . Once she had been thought dear , a treasure , the little red-haired Holiness girl whose laughter sparkled like light on a lake ; now she stood outside the gates of her father 's Prophecy , asleep inside his house . Her hair tumbled across her pillow and over the edge of the bed : a flame . * * * Only Hazel Hunnicutt slept soundly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazel Hunnicutt 's Used World Emporium  --  the station at the end of the line for objects that sometimes appeared tricked into visiting there  --  often dreamed of the stars , although she never counted them . Her nighttime ephemera included Mercury in retrograde ; Saturn in the trine position ( a fork in the hand of an old man whose dinner is , in the end , all of us ) ; the Lion , the Virgin , the Scorpion ; and figures of the cardinal , the banal , the venal . Hazel was the oldest of the three women by twenty years ; she was their patron , and the pause in their conversation . Only she still had a mother ( although Hazel would have argued it is mothers who have us ) ; only she could predict the coming weather , having noticed the spill of a white afghan in booth #43 and the billowing of a man 's white shirt as he stepped from the front of her store into the heat of the back . White white white . The color of purity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not eat , but also just whiteness for its own sake . If Hazel were awake she would argue for logic 's razor and say that the absence of color is what it is , or what it is n't . But she slept . Her hand twitched slightly , a gesture that would raise the instruments in an orchestra , and her cat Mao could not help but leap at the hand , but he did not bite . In the Used World Emporium itself , nothing lived , nothing moved , but the air was thick with expectancy nonetheless . It was a cavernous space , filled with the castoffs of countless lives , as much a grave in its way as any ruin . The black eyes of the rocking horses glittered like the eyes of a carp ; the ivory keys of an old piano were once the tusks of an African elephant . The racks of period clothing hung motionless , wineskins to be filled with a new vintage . The bottles , the bellows , the genuine horse-drawn sleigh now bedecked with bells and garlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were just objects , consistent so far from moment to moment , waiting for daybreak like everything else . It was mid-December in Jonah , Indiana , a place where Fate can be decided by the weather , and a storm was gathering overhead .
