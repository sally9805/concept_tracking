St. Lawrenceville , Missouri July 1838 <p> Molly McGarvie struggled to stand , the weight of her pregnancy an anchor fastening her to the ground . " Maybe Samuel 's back . It 's been almost three weeks . " <p> Betsy walked to her mistress and extended a hand , pulling Molly to her feet . " Do n't get your hopes up . Mr. Samuel said he was fixing to be gone a month . " <p> " I worry something might happen to him . " <p> " You 're borrowing trouble . Ai n't nothing ever happened before , has it ? " <p> Molly shook her head . " No . But I still want him home . " She smiled at the sight of her three children napping on a coverlet spread over the grass . Late afternoon sun angled through the grove of redbud trees , painting shadow pictures across their faces . " Children ! Time to wake up . We do n't want to be out after dark . " <p> Sleepy-eyed , they tottered to their feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , Mama ? " Three-year-old Luellen 's voice climbed a scale of apprehension . <p> Molly leaned forward and stroked the black curls that fringed her daughter 's face . " Do n't be afraid . We 'll be home in plenty of time . " <p> Luellen jutted her chin in the air . " I 'm not afraid . " <p> Molly shook her head . " I should 've named you ' Mary , Mary , quite contrary . ' " <p> She took Luellen 's hand and started along the track toward their cabin . Betsy gathered the picnic basket and blankets and fell in behind them on the dusty trail . Like puppies , her two sons chased each other in circles at the rear of the procession . <p> When she crested the hill above the settlement , Molly spotted their buckboard outside the stable . " Samuel 's back ! " She dropped Luellen 's hand and hurried down the path . <p> Once in front of the cabin , she looked past the buckboard and saw her husband in the stable tending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a wonderful surprise ! You 're early . " <p> Samuel met Molly near the opening of the three-sided log structure , part of the black gelding 's harness draped over one shoulder . He cupped his free hand around the back of her head and kissed the place on her forehead where her black hair grew in a widow 's peak . " You 're a sight for sore eyes , Wife . Soon 's I finish with Captain I 'll be up to the house . " <p> " I 'll wait . " Molly rested against a bag of grain while her husband hung the traces over a peg . She loved watching his long- fingered , broad-palmed hands as he worked . Molly believed there was nothing he could n't accomplish with the strength hidden inside them . <p> " You finished building the courthouse quicker than you thought . I 'm glad . " <p> " It 's not done yet . " Samuel swayed slightly when he squatted to unfasten Captain 's bellyband and hip straps . " When I was on the scaffold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Would of fell off , but my helper grabbed hold of me and got me down . I left him to finish the job and come on home . " <p> Molly felt a prickle of alarm . " What 's wrong ? " <p> " Do n't know . Got sick to my stomach a couple times on the way . " He hung the pieces of tack on another peg . <p> She reached up and felt his forehead . " You have a fever ! Let 's get you to bed-the boys can feed the horse . " <p> " Aw , Molly , don't- " He doubled over with a grunt of pain . Clutching his abdomen , he pushed past her and ran behind the stable . <p> She heard violent retching . Her sons ran across the packed earth in front of their cabin , trailed by Luellen . <p> Franklin raced past her , headed inside the stable . " Where 's Papa ? " <p> Molly caught the back of the younger boy 's shirt and tugged him away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " She looked at Betsy . " Help me get Samuel inside . " <p> " Where 's he at ? " <p> " Behind the stable . " <p> Betsy faced James . " You watch the chil'ren for a few minutes . I 'll be back directly . " <p> James reached for Luellen 's hand , but she sidled away . Her lower lip protruded . " I want to see Papa . " <p> " Not now . " Molly 's expression left no room for argument . <p> When the two women reached Samuel , they found him on his hands and knees . Between them they managed to help him to his feet . Once he started across the barnyard , he jerked free and stumbled toward the open door of their one-room cabin . <p> Molly 's heart raced as she followed his unsteady progress . What 's wrong ? <p> He stopped and rested his head against the doorframe . A sheen of sweat covered his face . <p> Molly wrapped an arm around his waist . " Let me help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust to the dimness inside . The small window under the loft allowed only a thin rib of light through its thick panes . Half supporting , half pushing , Molly guided her husband around a long puncheon table toward the sleeping area under the open stairway . <p> She rolled the patchwork coverlet back , revealing a linen sheet wrapped over a feather tick . Samuel sat on the edge , slumped like a puppet without strings . <p> The younger children followed them into the cabin . " Papa ? " <p> Molly blocked their path . " I told you Papa 's sick . You go outside with Betsy . " James hovered near the door , a worried expression on his face . " Son , go fetch Dr. Carson . " <p> " No ! Doc Carson 's a quack . " Samuel 's voice sounded raspy . " Get the new doc ... " He paused , forehead wrinkled . " Spengler , I think his name is . " <p> " Spengler 's in Fox River . James ca n't go that far by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carson helped when Luellen had asthma , did n't he ? " <p> Samuel doubled up , gasping . " Get the chamber pot , quick ! " <p> Molly grabbed it just as he leaned over and vomited a stream of yellow bile . When James hesitated at the door , she said , " Go ! Now ! Get Dr. Carson and tell him to hurry . " <p> * * * <p> The doctor stood at the far end of the table that bisected the cabin , his leather satchel open in front of him . A florid-faced man , he had the stub of a cigar clamped between his teeth . " It 's probably cholera . " <p> The words struck like bullets . Molly stood speechless , roaring filling her ears . Please , Lord , do n't take my Samuel . <p> Apparently reading the terror on her face , Dr. Carson added , " If we 're lucky , it 's a mild case . There 's every reason to believe he 'll recover . " <p> She grasped at the hope in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever recovered from cholera . " <p> " They do , more than folks think . " He picked a shred of tobacco from his lower lip and wiped his fingers on his pant leg . " Just takes the right doctoring-and catching it early . " <p> Molly looked at her husband , spent after bouts of vomiting , then glanced out the open door at her youngsters . " Are the children in danger ? " She spoke in a whisper , as though she could sneak the question past whatever fates controlled their destiny . <p> " Not if you farm them out , Miz McGarvie . Keep them away from Samuel until he 's well . " He flicked the cigar stub into the open fireplace behind him . " Can you get your husband 's brother to take them ? " <p> Molly cocked her head , considering . Would he do it ? " I suppose I could ask . But first , tell me how you 'll cure my husband . " <p> " He 'll pull through if I can get enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He placed a brown bottle on the tabletop , then reached back into his bag and lifted out a footed glass jar , its top covered with a piece of muslin . A dozen or more five-inch-long wormlike creatures squirmed inside . " Leeches . Bleeding him ought to get rid of the fever . " <p> She eyed the doctor 's food-spotted shirt and tobacco-stained hands . " What do you think , Samuel ? Tell me what to do . " <p> He shook his head . " I do n't know . We 'll have to- " He hung his head over the edge of the bed and vomited again . <p> Molly stood frozen in the center of the room . <p> Betsy slipped an arm over her shoulders . " Want me to set with him whilst you take the chil'ren to Mr. Brody 's ? " <p> Dr. Carson looked up , a squirming leech pinched between his fingers . " You might as well go . Nothing you can do right now . " <p> Molly nodded . She walked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fever burn through his skin onto her lips . " I 'll be back soon . " She stopped to light a lantern and then gathered her children . <p> Luellen tugged at Molly 's skirt and lifted her arms to be carried . Molly shook her head . " You 're not a baby . You can walk . We 're just going down the road to Uncle Brody 's . " She took the girl 's hand and started south on the dirt track that led through St. Lawrenceville . " Come on , " she called to her sons . " Auntie Patience will take care of you until Papa 's well . " <p> * * * <p> Lantern light flickered across Patience 's spiteful gaze . " I ca n't possibly look after your children . You know we 're already crowded with our three . " <p> Samuel 's younger brother Brody pushed past his wife and stood on the porch . " It 's not that we do n't sympathize , you understand . Tell Bub I 'll stop by tomorrow to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her temple . " After all Samuel 's done for you ? You ca n't make room for his children ? " She glared at him . " He did n't worry about being crowded when you needed shelter . " <p> Brody turned his back and stepped inside . The door creaked shut . <p> Molly 's mind ran through the short list of possible families in the settlement who might watch her children . Where can I take them ? She headed back in the direction of their cabin , frantically trying to think while she herded her brood through the growing darkness . <p> " How about Mr. Solomon 's ? " Franklin asked , as though he 'd read her mind . " He has rooms over the tavern . " He swung the bundle of clothing she 'd packed for them from one hand to the other . <p> She stopped and stared at him . " And how would you know that ? " <p> " That 's what the men at Papa 's brickyard say . There 's a lady that lives up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me about taverns , now or ever . Do you understand ? " <p> " Mama ? " James touched her arm . " The smithy likes us . Maybe we could stay with him . " <p> " Of course . Why did n't I think of that ? " The four of them turned north on the lane that passed their cabin . Luellen again tugged at Molly 's skirt to be carried . With a sigh , she handed the lantern to James and hoisted the heavy child onto one hip . <p> * * * <p> The blacksmith 's plump wife , Jewel , beamed at them . " Of course they can stay here . With our boys grown and gone , this house is too quiet . " Behind her , a steaming kettle hung on the fireplace crane and scented the air with the aroma of boiling meat and onions . A stack of wooden bowls rested at the end of a table similar to the one in her own cabin . <p> Jewel drew Luellen close to her skirts . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after . " <p> " Thank you , Mrs. Stanton . You 're a godsend . " Molly turned to her sons , giving each of them a hug and kiss . " You behave now ! Mind Mr. and Mrs. Stanton . " <p> " Come over here and say ' howdy , ' boys ! " Cody Stanton called from a high-backed armchair at one end of the room . <p> When James and Franklin left her side , Molly tied her bonnet over her coiled braids and walked to the door . <p> " I 've got supper ready , " Jewel said . " Do n't you want to set a bit ? Have something to eat ? You seem mighty tired . " <p> Molly shook her head . " Thank you . It 's late and I 'm worried about Samuel . " <p> " Well , do n't worry about these here youngsters . They can stay as long as it 's needful . " <p> * * * <p> For the next five days , Molly assisted each time Dr. Carson came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trusting that he knew what was best . But by week 's end , she 'd passed that point of belief . <p> With one hand pressed to her throat , she watched while the doctor removed the last engorged leech from Samuel 's abdomen . Blood oozed from the open wounds . Bandages , some showing bright bloodstains , covered the effects of previous leeching . Constant doses of calomel had purged his body so thoroughly that his skin seemed to cling to his bones . <p> " That 's enough . Let him be . " <p> Dr. Carson dropped the fat creature into its jar , where it landed with a soft splat on top of its writhing companions . He closed his satchel and tightened the strap with a quick tug . " There 's nothing more I can do anyways . " He looked at Samuel and shook his head . " Maybe he was too far gone when I got here . " <p> Nothing more he can do ? Molly walked to the far end of the room , motioning the doctor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is he ? " <p> When he reached the fireplace , the doctor pulled a new cigar from his coat pocket . He lit the end of a straw at the hearth and puffed until he had a cloud of blue smoke around his head . " Most likely he will , Miz McGarvie . " He swept his satchel from the table and strode out the door . <p> Molly sank into a chair beside the bed . Dr. Carson 's words echoed through her mind like a voice from the depths of a tomb . Most likely he will . She wanted to clap her hands over her ears to silence the pronouncement . Maybe the doctor 's wrong . Samuel 's always been strong . He can do anything . <p> She pushed limp strands of black hair out of his eyes . " I 'm here , dearest . " <p> His lips twitched in a weak smile . She stroked his forehead until he slept . <p> Betsy walked up behind her . " You need some rest . Let me set with him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and I 'm not here ? " <p> " Then how about some hot broth ? You have n't eaten nothing all day . " Betsy placed a pewter mug in her hands . " You need to take care so 's you do n't get it . What do you suppose would happen to the chil'ren without you ? " <p> Molly 's eyes widened . " I 've been so taken up with Samuel , I never thought about that . " And the baby ! If I die , the baby dies . <p> She set the mug on the floor , cupping her hands over her abdomen . A chill prickled her skin . If she and Samuel were both gone , the children would be orphans . Molly knew the plight of orphaned children on the frontier . Brothers and sisters were often separated and taken into homes where they were expected to earn their keep . She could n't let that happen . She stood and faced her friend . " Oh , Betsy , I 'm frightened . " Tears slid down her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rocking back and forth the same way she 'd soothe a child . " We just have to pray . God knows best . " <p> " God 's not listening . " Molly stepped back so she could see Betsy 's face . " I 've been praying , and it seems like he has n't heard a word ! " <p> Behind them , Samuel groaned and attempted to turn over . The two women hurried to the bedside . They each gripped a corner of the linen sheet under him and tugged , rolling his body until he rested on his left side . His eyelids fluttered open for a moment , then closed again . <p> " Will you stay with us tonight ? " Molly asked Betsy . <p> She nodded , pointing at the loft . " I 'll be up there . Call if you need me . " She turned down the flame in the lamp and climbed the stairs to bed . <p> Molly returned to her post beside Samuel , her body aching with weariness . A stray breeze from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . She wrinkled her nose . No matter how careful they were , it had n't been possible to keep her husband 's violent purging confined to slop jars . <p> Molly patted Samuel 's face . An elongated shadow of herself moved over the wall like a ministering spirit . <p> His eyes opened and he slipped his hand over hers . His mouth formed the words , " I love you , " but no sound emerged . <p> " I love you too . " She blinked back tears . <p> A long sigh escaped his lips and his body relaxed . <p> " Samuel ? " She felt his chest for a heartbeat . <p> Nothing . <p> Molly stared at his body , surprised she did n't feel like crying . She dragged the chair closer to the bed and lifted his hand , pressing it against her cheek . I want him to myself one last night . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
