For days the scientific grapevine had been buzzing with the news that Stephen Hawking , the brilliant physicist whose disease has put him in a wheelchair , heir to the revered Cambridge professorship once held by Isaac Newton , would be making a big announcement at a conference in Dublin , Ireland . Sure enough , last week before an array of TV cameras and hundreds of colleagues at the ordinarily obscure International Conference of General Relativity and Gravitation , Hawking declared that he had solved what he called " a major problem in theoretical physics . " Black holes , he said , do not forever annihilate all traces of what falls into them . <P> In making that announcement , Hawking recanted a position he had held for nearly 30 years . He also pulled the rug out from under a generation of science-fiction fans , declaring dead a favorite plot device . " There is no possibility of using black holes to travel to other universes , " he said , with evident regret . And , finally , he conceded defeat in a long-standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a problem in the first place . <P> The issue arose back in the 1960s , when physicists first described black holes , objects whose gravity is so powerful that nothing can escape , not even light . Under such crushing force , all information about what formed the hole would be forever locked away : you would have no way of distinguishing between a black hole made from a dying star and one formed from a quadrillion tons of Gorgonzola cheese . <P> But in the mid- ' 70s , Hawking threw a theoretical monkey wrench into the works . It was known that empty space is bubbling with " virtual particles "  --  pairs of particles and antiparticles that spontaneously appear out of nowhere , then annihilate each other and vanish . That happens so fast the particles can hardly be said to exist . But if it happens right at the edge of a black hole , Hawking realized , one particle might fall in before the annihilation , leaving its twin to escape in the form of radiation . Because the books of the cosmos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subtracted from the mass of the black hole . And since virtual particles are appearing everywhere all the time , every black hole must constantly radiate energy and will eventually disappear . <P> That was the problem . According to basic quantum theory , information ca n't be destroyed . Hiding it away forever inside a black hole is bad enough , but hiding it in a hole that eventually evaporates is unthinkable . <P> Others have tackled that conundrum and solved it to their satisfaction using various mathematical stratagems . But , says Juan Maldacena , a string theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , N.J. , who has worked on the question , " what was n't done was to explain precisely what was wrong with Hawking 's original calculations in the ' 70s . " Now Hawking claims to have done so . By doing the calculations a different way , he has convinced himself that the radiation flowing from a black hole actually carries information about the hole back out into the universe , although in a mangled form .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
