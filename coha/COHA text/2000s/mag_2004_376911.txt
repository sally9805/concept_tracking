With his sad brown eyes and soft , floppy ears , Marley , a 2-year-old Boxer , is the kind of dog that 's hard to resist . Just ask his co-owner Ashley Wilson , a music director at a Seattle rock station . After splitting up with her live-in boyfriend , Todd Templeton , just before Christmas last year , Wilson and Templeton exchanged Marley informally every week . Then , last August , according to a lawsuit filed by Wilson , Templeton abruptly ended the arrangement and kept Marley . <P> Instead of giving up or just getting a new dog , Wilson joined the growing ranks of animal lovers who are filing lawsuits over their pets . After consulting Adam Karp , a lawyer in Bellingham , Wash. , who says he has handled about 100 animal-related cases in the past four years , Wilson filed suit in late October . She has already won at least a temporary victory . Last month a superior court judge ordered the exchanges to resume immediately , pending a final ruling . ( Templeton declined to comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in three months , Wilson says , " His tail was wiggling out of control . I just hugged him and started to cry . " <P> While going to court to resolve a pet- custody dispute may seem extreme , it is just one of the legal options available to protect animals and the people who care for them . Veterinary-malpractice suits , pet-cruelty cases and even landlord-tenant disputes over animals are reaching the courts as well . In New York City , Cindy Adams , a gossip columnist for the New York Post , has called for legislation that would ensure better conditions at dog kennels after her Yorkshire terrier Jazzy died , allegedly at a kennel . Some 23 states now allow enforceable pet trusts , in which people set aside money in their will for the care of their pet . And when it comes to animal cruelty , more than 40 states have felony-level charges that virtually ensure jail time for serious offenders . " The courts are beginning to realize that the bond between humans and animals is very powerful , " says Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two books and taught a Harvard Law School course on the subject . <P> Some pet cases have reaped surprisingly large awards . Marc Bluestone of Sherman Oaks , Calif. , won a $39,000 jury award last February after Shane , his mixed-breed Labrador retriever , valued by the court at $10 , died just days after coming home from a two-month stay in a pet clinic . Although the suit took five years , cost more than $300,000 in legal fees and is on appeal , Bluestone says it was all worth it : " I ca n't get my baby back , but I did get justice . " <P> Once the domain solely of activists , animal law has steadily gained respect among law schools and legal scholars since 2000 , when Wise 's first book , Rattling the Cage , provided an academic argument for granting legal rights to animals . Now some 40 law schools offer courses on the topic . Cass Sunstein , professor at the University of Chicago Law School , explains the appeal in ethical terms : " There is a universal agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despise the notion of animal rights think that suffering and cruelty are problems .
