A Dilemma // Sometimes it is a banality  --  something a little sad and laughable  --  that makes you aware of a deep cultural change . On some level you already knew it , so that when the awareness comes , there is more recognition than surprise . Yes , of course , things have changed . // So it was not long after the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal began that it occurred to me that race had dramatically changed the terms by which political power is won and held in America . When I woke on that January morning to the sight of President Clinton wagging his finger on the morning news and saying " I never had sex with that woman , " I thought two things : that he was lying and that he would be out of office within two weeks . It was a month later that I realized not only that he might survive his entire term but also that his survival , even for a month , already spoke volumes about the moral criterion for holding power in the United States . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern California from Los Angeles with the scandal keeping me company on the car radio . A commentator said that President Eisenhower would not have survived a single day had he been caught in circumstances similar to President Clinton 's . Having grown up in the fifties , I thought this was probably true , and this is when the deep cultural shift became clear . // I seemed to remember  --  in the way that one vaguely remembers gossip about the famous  --  someone once telling me that Eisenhower occasionally used the word " nigger " on the golf course . Maybe he did ; maybe he did n't . In that era we blacks fully assumed that whites in all stations of life used this word at least in private . However , I can not imagine that a reporter in that era , overhearing Eisenhower speak in this way , would have seen it as anything more than jocular bad taste . Certainly no one would have questioned his fitness to hold office . Yet , if an affair with a young female intern had exploded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oval Office , thongs , cigars , etc. , there is little doubt that 1950s America would have judged him morally unfit to hold power . It was taken for granted in that gray-flannel era that public trust had to be reciprocated by a rigorous decorum around sexual matters , even if that decorum was the very face of hypocrisy . // Yet , on that long drive talk-show callers passionately argued that private indiscretions were no bar to public trust , that what Clinton did in his private life had no bearing on his ability to run the country . It was unapologetic moral relativism  --  the idea that sexual morality is relative only to the consent of the individuals involved , and that there is no other authority or moral code larger than their choice . In the voices of many callers you could hear this expressed as a kind of pride . Relativism spares us from far worse sins , they seemed to be saying , those greatest of all sins for my baby-boomer generation  --  judgmentalism and hypocrisy . // All this drew me back to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the student union , smoking French cigarettes and arguing that monogamy was a pass ? bourgeois convention . Of course it was an adolescent argument of perfectly transparent wishful thinking , since beneath all the big ideas  --  at least for us boys  --  was the fervent hope that the girls would actually believe it . There was a lot of lust in this kind of thinking  --  lust everywhere in baby-boomer thinking  --  and over time it became part of the generational license that opened the way for a sexual revolution . But it was jarring these many decades later  --  so deep now into adult life  --  to hear such thinking hauled out in defense of the president of the United States . // But then something occurred to me . I wondered if President Clinton would be defended with relativism if he had done what , according to gossip , Eisenhower was said to have done . Suppose that in a light moment he had slipped into a parody of an old Arkansas buddy from childhood and , to get the voice right , used the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tape of this came to light so that all day long in the media  --  from the unctuous morning shows to the freewheeling late-night shows to the news every half hour on radio  --  we would hear the unmistakable presidential voice saying , " Take your average nigger . . . " // Today in America there is no moral relativism around racism , no sophisticated public sentiment that recasts racism as a mere quirk of character . Today America is puritanical rather than relativistic around racism , and if Clinton had been caught in this way , it is very likely that nothing would have saved him . The very legitimacy of the American democracy in this post-civil rights era now requires a rigid , if not repressive , morality of racial equality . A contribution of the civil rights movement was to establish the point that a multiracial society can not be truly democratic unless social equality itself becomes a matter of personal morality . So a president 's " immorality " in this area would pretty much cancel his legitimacy as a democratic leader . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed President Eisenhower , and Eisenhower could easily have survived what would almost certainly have destroyed Clinton . Each man , finally , was no more than indiscreet within the moral landscape of his era ( again , Eisenhower 's indiscretion is hypothetical here for purposes of discussion ) . Neither racism in the fifties nor womanizing in the nineties was a profound enough sin to undermine completely the moral authority of a president . So it was the good luck of each president to sin into the moral relativism of his era rather than into its puritanism . And , interestingly , the moral relativism of one era was the puritanism of the other . Race simply replaced sex as the primary focus of America 's moral seriousness . //
