<p> Flamboyant lawyer Bruce Harvey demonstrated today what he says prosecutors hope Gold Club jurors will focus on : stripping . <p> Harvey , who represents dancer Jacklyn Bush , stepped up on a table during opening statements and slung his suit jacket off , his silver-gray ponytail dangling over his white shirt . <p> " I 'm a stripper  --  that 's what this case is about , " said Harvey as laughter rippled in the normally somber federal courtroom . " I get up on a table and I take my clothes off . That 's what I do . " <p> Harvey assumed the persona of his client as he outlined her defense during the second day of opening arguments in the Gold Club racketeering trial . He spoke in the first person of her confusion as to why she was charged with racketeering . <p> He dismissed charges that she was a prostitute as libelous and claimed she was being prosecuted because she was a skilled saleswoman of $350-a-bottle-and-up champagne . <p> " I 'm good at what I do , " said Harvey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talk to men . I can get them to buy champagne . And the more champagne I sell , the more money I make . " <p> " They have a board in the dressing room that says ' Champagne Seller of the Month . ' That 's Jacklyn Bush . " <p> U.S. District Judge Willis Hunt chastised Harvey when he spoke to jurors  --  as Bush , from the witness box , giving her testimony . But the judge stayed silent during the stripping charade minutes later . <p> Harvey reminded jurors that prostitution is sex for money . If no money is involved , it 's not prostitution . " It 's not illegal to have sex , I hope , " Harvey said . " Sometimes sex is just sex . " <p> Bush is a bit player in the 129-page indictment . She was n't even working for the Gold Club when the club organized the now-infamous trip to Charleston , S.C. , where dancers allegedly prostituted for a professional basketball team , Harvey said . The government contends Bush made similar trips to Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another subordinate player in the case , retired Atlanta policeman Reginald Burney , told jurors that his client was a public servant who got caught in the government 's zeal to convict . He asked them not to be blinded by the salacious facts of the case . <p> " This is about prosecutorial censorship versus constitutional entertainment , " he said . <p> The main player in the trial is Gold Club owner Steve Kaplan , who was the focus of opening statements Monday . <p> The question is whether he was running a swanky clip joint protected by the Mafia , or a legal business catering to the likes of Madonna , the King of Sweden and Donald Trump . <p> On Monday , lawyers for each side outlined their versions of the case against Kaplan and six co-defendants . Each side accused the other of greed , deceit and conspiracy . Defense lawyers said federal authorities have contrived a hollow case against Kaplan ; the prosecution claimed Kaplan used the landmark Buckhead club 's star power to defraud patrons . <p> " This is an organized crime case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a case about greed , about the desire for power and the fear of a national crime family . " <p> Leach accused Kaplan of being an associate of New York 's Gambino family who engaged in loan sharking , credit card fraud , prostitution and obstruction of justice . <p> Kaplan 's lawyer , Steve Sadow , said the government is framing his client to seize his $50 million in assets and to enhance the careers of federal prosecutors and agents . The nightclub owner was targeted by authorities , Sadow said , because he is a " stereotypical New York Jew "  --  successful , profane and confrontational . <p> " This is a case about greed and power  --  the government 's greed and power , " Sadow said . <p> To make its case against Kaplan , the prosecution has freed gangsters who have tortured , murdered and robbed , Sadow said . He called the witnesses and the FBI untrustworthy , noting the agency 's mishandling of the Timothy McVeigh case . <p> Leach countered that the prosecution was not able to rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such people do not become members of the Gambino crime family , " the prosecutor said . Leach defended the federal agents , saying they " did their job in commendable fashion . " <p> After opening statements conclude , FBI Special Agent John Steubing will be the first witness . He is expected to tell jurors how the Mafia works . <p> Monday 's opening statements made clear that the trial , which is expected to last for months , will include : <p> Testimony from professional athletes  --  including NBA star Patrick Ewing , Atlanta Falcon Jamal Anderson and Denver Bronco Terrell Davis  --  about sexual favors provided at the Gold Club . <p> Allegations of massive credit-card fraud in which Kaplan and his associates counted on customers not complaining about bogus charges lest wives learn of their patronage . <p> Complicated allegations about Kaplan 's links to the Gambino crime family , including John A. " Junior " Gotti . <p> A mini-course on the language of the Mafia : " button man , " " made guy , " " earner , " " kicking up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipper . " <p> Besides Kaplan , the defendants are Larry Gleit , the Gold Club 's chief financial officer ; retired Atlanta Police Officer Reginald Burney ; club managers Roy Cicola and Norbert Calder ; Michael DiLeonardo , accused of being a " captain " of the Gambino crime family ; and former dancer Jacklyn Bush , described by Leach as " a prostitute . " <p> Leach called the Gold Club an illegal enterprise that shipped cash to the Gambinos . Strippers poured out $350-a-bottle champagne to run up bills while managers doubled-billed until customers maxed out their credit cards , the prosecutor said . <p> One customer , " Mr. Kent , " was charged $24,000 in a couple of hours , while another admitted spending $150,000 in six months for sex with strippers , Leach said . He described Kaplan as a voyeur who would stay inside the private " VIP rooms " to direct the sex . Kent will testify , Leach said . <p> " This customer will tell you that intercourse was a nightly event at the Gold Club , " said Leach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Condoms were provided by the dancers . " <p> Kaplan began prostituting his dancers to professional athletes and others after NBA player Larry Johnson asked him for a woman in 1994 , Leach said . The club attracted athletes and celebrities by providing them with sex , which raised the club 's profile to attract big spenders whose credit cards could be milked , Leach said . <p> Leach portrayed the athletes as pawns in Kaplan 's scheme . " They are simply human , tricked and used through one of our strongest human appetites , our sexuality , " he said . <p> Sadow countered that huge profits are not a crime and that professional athletes hardly needed Kaplan to find them girls . <p> " I do n't think Patrick Ewing needed his help , " Sadow said , bringing smiles to some jurors . " I do n't think Terrell Davis needed his help . I do n't think Jamal Anderson needed his help . " <p> Defense attorney Don Samuel , who represents Gleit , dismissed the government 's allegations of credit card fraud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 customers , more 1 million people patronized the club over five years and about 85 percent used credit cards . <p> Samuel showed letters from two of the 18 alleged credit card victims . One man wrote prosecutors he had " never objected " to the billings . Another wrote that the indictment 's allegations are " simply wrong and erroneous . " <p> The club attracted movie stars , politicians and famous lawyers as well as athletes . Samuel ticked off one celebrity guest after another : Trump , Madonna , Michael Jordan , Mick Jagger , George Clooney , Bruce Willis , David Justice , Chipper Jones , Andruw Jones , Sammy Sosa , Mike Piazza , Dan Ackroyd , Hulk Hogan , Troy Aikman , Joe Montana . <p> The King of Sweden watched nude dancers in one of the club 's private rooms during the 1996 Olympics , said defense lawyer Nick Lotito , who represents Cicola , a club manager . <p> Even a group of FBI agents giving a going-away bash to a colleague went to the Gold Club , Samuel said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's common for some men to drop exorbitant amounts of money at the club . He told jurors of one customer who tipped $500 . <p> " I ca n't explain why , but men will do crazy things , " Samuel said .
