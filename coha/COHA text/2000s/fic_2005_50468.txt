One of the prime forces in the cyberpunk movement , Brace Sterling keeps busy these days with things like a monthly column in Wired magazine , novels such as The Zenith Angle , and a blog at http : **26;2742;TOOLONG . His new contribution to our magazine-his first since " In Paradise " ( September , 2002 ) - is a fantasy story unlike most . It 's hard to describe , but perhaps " Crusaderpunk " does the story some justice . Whatever you call it , it 's definitely a wild ride ... <p> A MESSENGER FLEW ABOVE the alleys of Tyre , skirting the torn green heads of the tallest palm trees . With a flutter of wings , it settled high on a stony ledge . The pigeon was quickly seized by a maiden within the tower . She gratefully kissed the bird 's sleek gray head . Sir Roger of Edessa , the maiden 's lover , roamed the Holy Land on his knight errantry . Thanks to the maiden herself , Sir Roger possessed one precious cage of homing pigeons . Roger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , soaring over every obstacle in a Holy Land aflame . The birds flapped over drum-pounding , horn-blaring Seljuk marauders , and evil mamelukes with faces masked in chainmail . They flitted over Ismaili fedayeen bent on murder and utterly careless of life . An entire , busy network of messenger pigeons moved over the unknowing populace . These birds carried news through Jerusalem , Damascus , Cairo , and Beirut . They flitted over cavaliers from every cranny of Christendom , armed pilgrims who were starving , sweating , flea-bitten and consumed with poxes . Birds laden with script flew over sunburned , axe-wielding Vikings . Over fanatical Templars and cruel , black-clad Teutonic Knights , baking like armored lobsters in the blazing sun . Over a scum of Greek peltasts and a scrim of Italian condottiere . With trembling , ink-stained fingers , the maiden untied the tidy scroll from the bird 's pink leg . There was a pounding ache within her bosom . Would it be another poem ? She often swooned on reading Roger 's poems . No . This bird had not come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own false hopes . The messenger bird was just another tiresome commercial bird . It carried nothing but a sordid rush of text . " Salt . Ivory . Tortoiseshell . Saffron . Rice . Frankincense . Iron . Copper . Tin .

Diamonds . Rubies . Sapphires . " Every good in this extensive list was followed by its price . The girl locked the pigeon into its labeled wooden cage , along with dozens of other birds , her fellow captives within the gloomy tower . Using cuttlefish ink and a razor-trimmed feather , the girl copied the message into an enormous dusty ledger . If she ever failed in her duty to record , oh the woe she would receive at the hands of the Mother Superior . Bread and water . Endless kneeling , many rosaries . The pigeon clerk rubbed at her watery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She returned to lean her silken elbows on the cool , freckled stone , to contemplate the sparkling Mediterranean and a black swarm of profiteering Italian galleys . Perhaps Sir Roger of Edessa was dead . Poor Roger had been slain by a cruel Moslem champion , or else he was dead of some plague . Roger would never write a poem to her again . At the age of seventeen , she was abandoned to her desolate fate . How likely all this seemed . Her doom was so total and utter . If Roger failed to rescue her from this miserable life tending pigeons , she would be forced to take unwelcome vows .... She would have to join the Little Sisters of the Hospitallers below the tower of birds , in that ever-swelling crowd of the Holy Land 's black widows , another loveless wretch of a girl amid that pitiful host of husbandless crones and fatherless orphans , all of them bottled up behind tall , rocky walls , hopelessly trapped without any lands or dowries .... The pale brides of Christ , moody and distracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dark-eyed Moslem fiends to conquer Tyre and ravage their fortress of chastity .... Another bird appeared in flight . The maiden 's heart rose to beat in her throat . This was a strong bird , a swift one . When he arrived , his legs were clasped by two delicate bands of gold . His feathers smelled of incense . The writing , though very tiny , was the most beautiful the girl had ever seen . The ink was blood-red , and it glittered . DEAREST HUDEGAR With the tip of my brush I give you the honey of good news Our Silent Master has summoned us both So prepare yourself quickly For I hasten to you with a caravan of many strong men to take you to his Paradise ( signed ) THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN The maiden began to weep , for her name was not Hudegar . She had never heard of any woman named Hudegar . Whether Christian or Moslem , hamlets in the Holy Land were always much the same : a huddle of dusty cottages around a well , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demurely into the plundered village , escorted by the heavily armed caravan of the Grand Assassin . This hapless little village had been crushed with particular gusto . Vengeful marauders had hacked down the olive groves , set fire to the vineyard , and poisoned the well . Since they were still close to Tyre , the strongest city yet held by the reeling Crusader forces , Hildegart rather suspected the work of Hospitallers . This conclusion disturbed her . Hildegart herself had founded the Hospitaller Order . She had created and financed a hospital corps in order to heal the sick , to run a chain of inns , and to give peace , comfort , and money-changing services to the endless sun-dazed hordes of holy European pilgrims . Hildegart 's idea had been a clever one , and was much appreciated by her patron , the Silent Master . However , some seventy years had passed since this invention of hers , and Hildegart had been forced to see her brilliant scheme degenerating . Somehow the Hospitaller corps , this kindly order of medical monks , had transformed itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces . It seemed that their skills in healing injured flesh and bone also gave them a special advantage in chopping men apart . Even the Templars were scared of the Hospitallers , and the Templars frightened Assassins so badly that the Assassins often paid them for protection . Some of the barns in the smashed village were still defensible . Sinan , the Old Man of the Mountain and the Ayatollah of Assassins , ordered his caravan to put up for the night . The caravan men made camp , buried several abandoned corpses , set up sentries , and struggled to water the horses with the tainted murk from the well . The Abbess and the Assassin settled down behind their armed sentries , to eat and chat . Hildegart and Sinan had known each other for much longer than most people would ever live . Despite the fact that they both labored loyally for the Silent Master , their personal relations were rather strained . There had been times in her long , long life when Hildegart had felt rather safe and happy with Sinan . Sinan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinan had once sheltered her from men even more dangerous than himself . Those pleasant years of their history , unfortunately , were long behind both of them . At the age of one hundred seventeen , Sinan could not possibly protect Hildegart from any man more dangerous than himself , for Sinan the Assassin had become the most dangerous man in the world . The number of Crusaders who had fallen to his depredations was beyond all reckoning , though Hildegart shrewdly estimated it at somewhere over four thousand . Underlit by red flames from his dainty iron camp stove , Sinan ate his roasted kabobs and said little . He offered her a warm , dark , gazelle-eyed look . Hildegart stirred uneasily in her dark riding cloak , hood , and wimple . Although Sinan was very intelligent and had learned a great deal about inflicting terror , Sinan 's heart never changed much with the passing decades . He was always the same . Sinan was simple , direct , and devout in his habits , and he prayed five times every day , which ( by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand acts of prayer , every one of them involving a fervent hope that Crusaders would perish and burn in Hell . Hildegart warmed one chilly hand at the iron brazier . Nearby , the homing pigeons cooed in their portable cribs . The poor pigeons were cold and unhappy , even more anxious to return to Tyre than she was . Perhaps they sensed that Sinan 's mercenaries longed to pluck and eat them . " Sinan , where did you find this horrible band of cutthroats ? " " I bought them for us , my dear , " Sinan told her politely . " These men are Khwarizmian Turks from the mountains far beyond Samarkand . They are quite lost here in Palestine , without any land or loyalties . Therefore they are of use to me , and to our Silent Master , and to his purposes . " " Do you trust these bandy-legged fiends ? " " No , I do n't trust them at all . But they speak only an obscure dialect , and unlike you and me , they are not People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they may see of our Silent Master . Besides , the Khwarizmian Turks were cheap to purchase . They flee a great terror , you see . They flee the Great Khan of the Mongols . " Hildegart considered these gnomic remarks . Sinan was n't lying . Sinan never lied to her ; he was just grotesquely persistent in his pagan delusions . " Sinan , do I need to know more about terrible Great Khan ? " " Better not to contemplate such things , my pearl of wisdom . Let 's play a game of chess . " " Not this time , no . " " Why be coy ? I 'll spot you an elephant rook ! " " My markets for Chinese silk have been very disturbed these past ten years . Is this so-called Great Khan the source of my commercial difficulty ? " Sinan munched thoughtfully at his skewer of peppered mutton . Her remarks had irritated him . Brave men killed and died at Sinan 's word , and yet she , Hildegart , was far richer than he was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the founder , accountant , banker , and chief moneylender of the Hospitaller order , Hildegart found her greatest joy in life managing international markets . She placed her money into goods and cities where it would create more money , and then she counted that money with great and precise care , and she placed it again . Hildegart had been doing this for decades , persistently and secretly , through a network of nameless agents in cities from Spain to India , a network linked by swift birds and entirely unsuspected by mankind . Sinan knew how all this counting and placing of money was done , but as an Ayatollah of Assassins , he considered it boring and ignoble labor . That was why he was always sending her messenger birds and begging her for loans of cash . " Dear , kind , sweet Hudegar , " the Assassin said coaxingly . Hildegart blushed . " No one calls me Hudegar . Except for you , they all died ages ago . " " Dear Hudegar , how could I ever forget my sweet pet name for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . " " We 're all the slaves of God , my precious ! Even our Silent Master . " Sinan yanked the metal skewer from his strong white teeth . " Are you too proud to obey his summons now , blessed Mother Superior ? Are you tired of your long life , now that your Christian Franks are finally chased back into the sea by the warriors of righteousness ? " " I 'm here with you , are n't I ? " said Hildegart , avoiding his eyes . " I could be tending the wounded and doing my accounts . Why did you write to me in French ? The whole convent 's chattering about your mysterious bird and its message . You know how women talk when they 've been cloistered . " " You never answer me when I write to you in Arabic , " Sinan complained . He mopped at his fine black beard with a square of pink Chinese silk . " I write to you constantly ! You know the cost of shipping these homing pigeons ! Their flesh is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thickening smoke from the coals of his cookstove . Hildegart lit the sesame oil at the spout of a small brass lamp . " I do write to you , dear Sinan , with important financial news , but in return , you write to me of nothing but your evil boasting and your military mayhem . " " I 'm composing our history there ! " Sinan protested . " I am putting my heart 's blood into those verses , woman ! You of all women should appreciate that effort ! " " Oh , very well then . " Hildegart switched to Arabic , a language she knew fluently , thanks to her years as a captive concubine . " ' With the prodigies of my pen I express the marvel of the fall of Jerusalem , ' " she quoted at him . " ' I fill the towers of the Zodiac with stars , and the caskets with my pearls of insight . I spread the joyful news far and wide , bringing perfume to Persia and conversation to Samarkand . The sweetness of holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How clever you are , Hudegar ! Those were my finest verses , too . " Sinan 's dark , arching brows knotted hopefully . " That 's some pretty grand stuff there , is n't it ? " " You should n't try to be a poet , Sinan . Let 's face it , you are an alchemist . " " But I 've learned everything there is to know about chemistry and machinery , " Sinan protested . " Those fields of learning are ignoble and boring . Poetry and literature , by contrast , are fields of inexhaustible knowledge ! Yes , I admit it , I do lack native talent for poesy - for when I began writing , my history was just a dry recital of factual events ! But I have finally found my true voice as a poet , for I have mastered the challenge of narrating great deeds on the battlefield ! " Hildegart 's temper rose . " Am I supposed to praise you for that ? I had investments in Jerusalem , you silly block of wood ! My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... and you can bet I 'll tell the Blemmye all about those severe commercial losses ! " " You may quote me even further , and recite to him how Christian Jerusalem fell to the Moslems in flames and screams , " said Sinan tautly . " Tell him that every tribe of Frank will be chased back into the ocean ! Eighty-nine long years since these unbathed wretches staggered in from Turkey to steal our lands , looking like so many disinterred corpses ! But at last , broken with righteous fire and sword , the occupiers flee the armies of Jihad like whipped dogs . Never to return ! I have lived through all of that humiliation , Hudegar . I was forced to witness every sorrowful day of my people 's long affliction . At last , in this glorious day of supreme justice , I will see the backs of those alien invaders . Do you know what I just heard Saladin say ? " Hildegart ate another salted olive . She had been born in Germany and had never gotten over how delicious olives were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Saladin will build ships and sail after the retreating Christians to Europe . " Sinan drew an amazed breath . " Can you imagine the stern qualities of that great soldier , who would trust to the perils of the open ocean to avenge our insulted faith ? That 's the greatest tribute to knightly bravery that I can imagine ! " " Why do you even bother with lowborn scum like Saladin ? Saladin is a Kurd and a Shi'ite . " " Oh , no . Saladin is the chosen of God . He used the wealth of Egypt to conquer Syria . He used the wealth of Syria to conquer Mesopotamia . The wealth of Mesopotamia will finally liberate Palestine . Saladin will die with exhausted armies and an empty treasury . Saladin is very thin , and he suffers from bellyaches , but thanks to him , Palestine will be ours again . Those outlaw Crusader states of Christian Outremer will cease to be . That is the divine truth of history and yes , I will bear witness to divine truth . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a scholar . " Hildegart sighed , at a loss for words . Hildegart knew so many words , reams and reams of words . She knew low German , French , Arabic , much Turkish , some Greek . Proper history was written in Latin , of course . Having successfully memorized the Old and New Testaments at the age of fourteen , Hildegart could manage rather well in Latin , but she had given up her own attempts to write any kind of history during the reign of Baldwin the Leper . The Crusader King of Jerusalem had a loathsome Middle Eastern disease , and Hildegart found herself chronicling Baldwin 's incessant defeats in a stale , stilted language that smelled of death . " King Baldwin the Leper suffered this crushing setback , King Baldwin the Leper failed at that diplomatic initiative .... " The Leper seemed to mean well , and yet he was so stupid .... One stormy morning Hildegart had pulled years of secret records from her hidden cabinets and burned every one of them . It felt so good to destroy such weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her hopefully . " Ca n't you say just a bit more about my glamorous poetic efforts , Hudegar ? " " You are improving , " she allowed . " I rather liked that line about the candied fruits . Those jongleurs of Eleanor of Aquitaine , they never write verse half so luscious as you do . " Sinan beamed on her for a moment , and returned to gnawing his mutton . However , he was quick to sense a left-handed compliment . " That Prankish queen , she prefers the love poems made by vagrants for women . All Prankish ladies enjoy such poems . I myself can write very sweetly about women and love . But I would never show those poems of mine to anyone , because they are too deeply felt . " " No doubt . " Sinan narrowed his eyes . " I can remember every woman who ever passed through my hands . By name and by face ! " " All of them ? Could that be possible ? " " Oh come now , I never married more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my wives very vividly . I shall prove it to you now , my doubting one ! My very first wife was the widow of my older brother ; she was Fatima , the eldest , with the two sons , my nephews . Fatima was dutiful and good . Then there was the Persian girl that the Sultan gave me : she was Bishar . She had crossed eyes , but such pretty legs . When my fortunes prospered , I bought the Greek girl Phoebe to cook for my other two . " Hildegart shifted uneasily . " Then there was you , Hudegar the Prankish girl , my gift from the Silent Master . What splendid flesh you had . Hair like wheat and cheeks like apples . How you thrived in my courtyard and my library . You wanted kisses more than the other three combined . We had three daughters and the small son who died nameless . " Sinan sighed from the depth of his heart . " Those are all such songs of loss and sorrow , my sweet songs of all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangled and difficult . She had left Germany as a teenaged nun in the massive train of Peter the Hermit , a tumbling migration of thousands of the wildly inspired , in the People 's Crusade . They walked down the Rhine , they trudged down the Danube , they stumbled starving across Hungary , Byzantium , and the Balkans , asking at every town and village if the place might perhaps be Jerusalem . The People " s Crusade killed most of its participants , but a crusade was the only sure way that Hildegart , who was the humble daughter of a falconer , could guarantee the remission of her sins . Hildegart marched from April to October of 1096 . She was raped , starved , survived typhus , and arrived pregnant on an obscure hilltop in Turkey . There every man in her dwindling band was riddled with Seljuk arrows by the troops of Kilij Arslan . Hildegart was purchased by a Turkish speculator , who took her infant for his own purposes , and then sold her to the aging Sultan of Mosul . The Sultan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to her own devices within his harem . The Mosul harem was a quiet , solemn place , very much like the convent she had left in Germany , except for the silks , the dancing , and the eunuchs . There Hildegart learned to speak Turkish and Arabic , to play a lute , to embroider , and to successfully manage the considerable administrative overhead involved in running the palace baths . After the Sultan 's murder , she was manumitted and conveyed to a Jewish merchant , by whom she had a son . The Jew taught her accounting , using a new system of numeration he had learned from colleagues in India . He and the son then vanished on an overly daring business expedition into Christian-held Antioch . Hildegart was sold to meet his business debts . Given her skills and accomplishments , though , she was quickly purchased by a foreign diplomat . This diplomat traveled extensively through Islam , together with his train of servants , in a slow pilgrimage from court to court . It was a rewarding life , in its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners . Foreign merchants and envoys , who lacked local clan ties , often made the most honest and efficient court officials . The Blemmye profited by this . Literate scholars of the Islamic courts had of course heard tell of the exotic Blemmyae people . The Blemmyae were men from the land of Prester John , the men whose heads grew beneath their shoulders . The Blemmye had no head ; he was acephalous . Across his broad , barren shoulders grew a series of horny plates . Where a man might have paps , the Blemmye had two round black eyes , and he had a large , snorting nose in his chest . Where a navel might have been was his mouth . The Blemmye 's mouth was a round , lipless , speechless hole , white and pink and ridged inside , and cinching tight like a bag . The Blemmye 's feet , always neatly kept in soft leather Turkish boots , were quite toeless . He had beautiful hands , however , and his dangling , muscular arms were as round and solid as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not speak aloud , was widely known for his courteous behavior , his peaceable demeanor , and his generous gifts . In the troubled and turbulent Damascene court , the Blemmye was accepted without much demur . The Blemmye was generally unhappy with the quality of his servants . They lacked the keen intelligence to meet his exacting requirements . Hildegart was a rare find for him , and she rose rapidly in her Silent Master 's estimation . The Blemmye wrote an excellent Arabic , but he wrote it in the same way he read books : entire pages at once , in one single comprehensive glance . So rather than beginning at the top of a page and writing from right to left , as any Arab scholar would , the Blemmye dashed and dotted his black markings across the paper , seemingly at random . Then he would wait , with unblinking eyes , to see if enough ink had arrived for his reader 's comprehension . If not , then he would dabble in more ink , but the trial annoyed him . Hildegart had a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Hildegart , Arabic was also a foreign language , but she memorized long texts with ease , and she was exceedingly clever with numbers . Despite her master 's tonguelessness , she also understood his moods , mostly through his snorts and his nervous , hand-wringing gestures . The Blemmye became reliant on her services , and he rewarded her well . When his business called him far from Damascus , the Blemmye conveyed Hildegart to the care of his chief agent within the Syrian court , an Iraqi alchemist and engineer . Rashid al-din Sinan made his living from " Naphth , " a flaming war-product that oozed blackly from the reedy marshes of his native Tigris . Like most alchemists , Sinan had extensive interests in hermetic theology , as well as civil engineering , calligraphy , rhetoric , diplomacy , and the herbarium . As a canny and gifted courtier , living on his wits , Sinan was quick to serve any diplomat who could pay for his provisions with small but perfect diamonds , as the Blemmye did . Sinan gracefully accepted Hildegart as his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Blemmye , being a diplomat , was deeply involved in international trade . He tirelessly sought out various rare oils , mineral salts , glasses , saltpeter , sulfur , potash , alchemical acids , and limes . He would trade in other goods to obtain the substances he prized , but his means were always subordinated to those same ends . The Blemmye 's personal needs were rather modest . However , he lavished many gifts on his mistress . The Blemmye was pitifully jealous of this female Blemmye . He kept her in such deep , secluded purdah that she was never glimpsed by anyone . Hildegart and Sinan became the Blemmye 's most trusted servants . He gave them his alchemical philters to drink , so that their flesh would not age in the mortal way of men and women . Many years of energetic action transpired , led by the pressing needs of their Silent Master . As wizard and mother abbess , Sinan and Hildegart grew in age and cunning , wealth and scholarship . Trade routes and caravans conveyed the Blemmye 's goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the Spice Islands . When Crusader ships appeared in the Holy Land , and linked the Moslem world with the distant commercial cities of the Atlantic and the Baltic , the Blemmye was greatly pleased . Eventually , Sinan and Hildegart were forced to part , for their uncanny agelessness had aroused suspicion in Damascus . Sinan removed himself to a cult headquarters in Alamut , where he pursued the mystic doctrines and tactics of the Ismaili Assassins . Hildegart migrated to the Crusader cities of Outremer , where she married a wise and all-accepting Maronite . She had three more children by this union . Time ended that marriage as it had all her other such relations . Eventually , Hildegart found that she had tired of men and children , of their roughness and their importunities . She resumed the veil as the female Abbess of a convent stronghold in Tyre . She became the wealthy commander of a crowd of cloistered nuns , busy women with highly lucrative skills at weaving , adorning , and marketing Eastern fabrics . The Abbess Hildegart was the busiest person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she received many informations from the farthest rims of the world , and she knew the price and location of the rarest of earthly goods . Yet there was a hollowness in her life , a roiling feeling that dark events were unfolding , events beyond any mastery . Assuming that all her children had somehow lived - and that her children had children , and that they had lived as well - and that those grandchildren , remorseless as the calendar , had further peopled the Earth - Hildegart 's abacus showed her as a silent Mother Superior to a growing horde of over three hundred people . They were Christians , Jews , Moslems , a vast and ever-ramifying human family , united in nothing but their ignorance of her own endlessly spreading life . The Dead Sea was as unpleasant as its name . Cursed Sodom was to the south , suicidal Masada to the middle , and a bloodstained River Jordan to the north . The lake gave pitch and bitumen , and mounds of gray , tainted salt . Birds that bathed in its water died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caves on the Dead Sea shores had gone undisturbed for centuries . Within this barren wilderness , the Blemmye had settled himself . Of late , the Silent Master , once so restless in his worldly quests for goods and services , moved little from his secretive Paradise , dug within the Dead Sea 's barren hills . Sometimes , especially helpful merchants from Hildegart 's pigeon network would be taken there , or Assassins would be briefed there on one last self-sacrificing mission . It was in the Blemmye 's Paradise that Sinan and Hildegart drank the delicious elixirs that lengthened their lives . There were gardens there , and stores of rare minerals . The Blemmye 's hidden palace also held an arsenal . It concealed the many sinister weapons that Sinan had built . No skill in military engineering was concealed from the cunning master of Assassins . Sinan knew well the mechanical secrets of the jarkh , the zanbarak , the qaws al-ziyar , and even the fearsome manjaniq , a death-machine men called " The Long-Haired Bride . " With the Blemmye 's aid and counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silk and horsehair , capable of firing great iron beams , granite stones , red-hot bricks , and sealed clay bombs that splattered alchemical flames . Spewing , shrieking rockets from China were not beyond Sinan 's war skills , nor was the Byzantine boiler that spewed ever-burning Greek Fire . Though difficult to move and conceal , these massive weapons of destruction were frighteningly potent . In cunning hands , they had shaped the fates of many a quarrelsome emirate . They had even hastened the fall of Jerusalem . In his restless travels , the Blemmye had collected many rare herbs for the exquisite pergolas of his Paradise . He carefully collected the powder from within their flowers , and strained and boiled their saps for his marvelous elixirs . The Blemmye had forges and workshops full of curious instruments of metal and glass . He had struggled for years to breed superior camels for his far-ranging caravans . He had created a unique race of peculiar beasts , with hairless , scaly hides and spotted necks like cameleopards . The choicest feature of the Blemmye 's Paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a loud prayer of thanksgiving for their safe arrival . He commended their souls to his God , then he ushered the dusty , thirsting warriors within the marbled precincts . Pure water gushed there from many great brass nozzles . The men eagerly doffed their chain-mail armor and their filthy gear . They laughed and sang , splashing their tattooed limbs in the sweet , cleansing waters . Delicate fumes of incense made their spirits soar to the heavens . Very gently , their spirits left their bodies . The freshly washed dead were carried away on handcarts by the Blemmye 's house servants . These servants were eunuchs , and rendered tongueless . Through her long and frugal habit , Hildegart carefully sorted through the effects of the dead men . The Moslem and Christian women who haunted the battlefields of the Holy Land , comforting the wounded and burying the slain , generally derived more wealth from dead men than they ever did from their live protectors . Female camp followers of various faiths often encountered one another in the newly strewn fields of male corpses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clothes , trinkets , holy medals , knives , and bludgeons . Sinan sought her out as Hildegart neatly arranged the dead men 's dusty riding boots . He was unhappy . " The Silent One has written his commands for us , " he told her . He frowned over his freshly inked instructions . " The eunuchs are to throw the bodies of the men into the mine shaft , as usual . But then we are to put the caravan 's horses into the bath as well . All of them ! " The Assassin gazed at her moodily . " There would seem to be scarcely anyone here . I see none of his gardeners , I see no secretaries .... The Master is badly understaffed . Scutwork of this kind is unworthy of the two of us . I do n't understand this . " Hildegart was shocked . " It was well worth doing to rid ourselves of those evil foreign Turks , but we ca n't possibly stable horses in that beautiful marble bath . " " Stable them ? My dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mine . That 's what the Master has written for us here . see if there 's not some mistake , eh ? You were always so good at interpreting . " Hildegart closely examined the spattered parchment . The Blemmye 's queer handwriting was unmistakable , and his Arabic had improved with the years . " These orders are just as you say , but they make no sense . Without pack-horses , how am I to return to Tyre , and you to Alamut ? " Sinan looked at her in fear . " What are you telling me ? Do you dare to question the Silent Master 's orders ? " " No , you 're the man , " she told him quickly . " You should question his orders . " HILDEGART HAD NOT had an audience with the Blemmye in some eight years . Their only communication was through couriers , or much more commonly , through the messenger birds . In earlier days , when his writings had been harder to interpret , Hildegart had almost been a body servant to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grapes , bread , and honey , and even seen him off to his strange , shrouded bed . Then she had left him to dwell in his Paradise , and she had lived for many years many leagues away from him . As long as they were still writing to each other , however , he never complained about missing her . The Blemmye gave her his old , knowing look . His eyes , round , black , and wise , spread in his chest a hand 's span apart . The Blemmye wore baggy trousers of flowered blue silk , beautiful leather boots , and of course no headgear . He sat cross-legged on a velvet cushion on the floor of his office , with his Indian inks , his wax seals , his accounting books , and his elaborate plans and parchments . The Blemmye 's enormous arms had gone thinner with the years , and his speckled hide looked pale . His hands , once so deft and tireless , seemed to tremble uncontrollably . " The Master must be ill , " hissed Hildegart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they were almost certain that the Blemmye could not hear or understand a whispered voice . The Blemmye did have ears , or fleshy excrescences anyway , but their Silent Master never responded to speech , even in the languages that he could read and write . " I will formally declaim the splendid rhetoric that befits our lordly Master , while you will write to him at my dictation , " Sinan ordered . Hildegart obediently seated herself on a small tasseled carpet . Sinan bowed low , placing his hand on his heart . He touched his fingertips to lips and forehead . " A most respectful greetings , dread Lord ! May Allah keep you in your customary wisdom , health and strength ! The hearts of your servants overflow with joy over too long an absence from your august presence ! " " How are you doing , dear old Blemmye ? " Hildegart wrote briskly . She shoved the parchment forward . The Blemmye plucked up the parchment and eyed it . Then he bent over , and his wrist slung ink in a fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness between the worlds closes in / my nights burn unbroken by sleep I bleed slowly / from within /1 have no strength to greet the dawn / for my endless days are spent in sighing grief and vain regrets / the Light of All My Life has perished / I will never hear from her again / never never never again / will I read her sweet words of knowledge understanding and consolation / henceforth I walk in darkness / for my days of alien exile wind to their fatal climax . " Hildegart held up the message and a smear of ink ran down it like a black tear . The two of them had never had the least idea that the Blemmye 's wife had come to harm . The Blemmye guarded her so jealously that such a thing scarcely seemed possible . But the mistress of their Silent Master , though very female , was not a Blemmye at all . She was not even a woman . The Blemmye led them to the harem where he had hidden her . This excavation had been the Blemmye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bore and dig deep shafts into the soft Dead Sea limestone . The slaves often died in despair from the senseless work , perishing from the heat , the lack of fresh water , and the heavy , miasmic salt air . But then , at Hildegart 's counseling , the hapless slaves were freed and dismissed . Instead of using harsh whips and chains , the Blemmye simply tossed a few small diamonds into the rubble at the bottom of the pit . Word soon spread of a secret diamond mine . Strong men from far and wide arrived secretly in many eager gangs . Without orders , pay , or any words of persuasion , they imported their own tools into the wasteland . Then the miners fought recklessly and even stabbed each other for the privilege of expanding the Blemmye 's diggings . Miraculous tons of limestone were quarried , enough rock to provide firm foundations for every structure in the Blemmye 's Paradise . The miners wept with delight at the discovery of every precious stone . When no more diamonds appeared , the miners soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swiftly forgotten . Within this cavernous dugout , then , was where the Blemmye had hidden his darling . The Silent Master removed a counterweigh ted sheet of glass and iron . From the black gulf , an eye-watering , hellish stink of lime and sulfur wafted forth . Strapping two panes of glass to his enormous face , the Blemmye inhaled sharply through his great trumpet of a nose . Then he rushed headlong into the stinking gloom . Hildegart urged Sinan to retreat from the gush of foul miasma , but the Assassin resisted her urgings . " I always wondered what our Master did with all that brimstone . This is astonishing . " " The Blemmye loves a creature from Hell , " said Hildegart , crossing herself . " Well , if this is Hell , then we ourselves built it , my dear . " Sinan shrouded his eyes and peered within the acid murk . " I see so many bones in there . I must go in there , you know , I must bear witness and write of all this .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you joking ? A mine is no place for a woman ! " " Of course it is , my dear ! You simply must come down into Hell with me . You 're the only aide memoire available , and besides , you know that I rely on your judgment . " When Hildegart stiffly refused him , Sinan shrugged at her womanly fears and rushed forward into the gassy murk . Hildegart wept for him , and began to pray - praying for her own sake , because Sinan 's salvation was entirely beyond retrieval . At the fifth bead of her rosary , the brave Assassin reappeared , halfleading his stricken Master . They were tugging and heaving together at a great , white , armored plate , a bone-colored thing like a gigantic shard of " pottery . This broken armor , with a few tangled limbs and bits of dry gut , that was all that was left of the Blemmye 's Lady . She had been something like a great , boiled , stinking crab . Something like a barb-tailed desert scorpion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloistered deep within the smoking , stony earth , the Blemmye 's Lady had fed well , and grown into a size so vast and bony and monstrous that she could no longer fit through the narrow cave mouth . Sinan and the Blemmye were barely able to tug her skeletal remnants into daylight . The Blemmye pawed at a hidden trigger , and the great iron door swung shut behind him with a hollow boom . He wheezed and coughed , and snorted loudly through his dripping nose . Sinan , who had breathed less deeply of the hellish fumes , was the first to recover . He spat , and wiped his streaming eyes , then gestured to Hildegart for pen and ink . Then Sinan sat atop a limestone boulder . He ignored her questions with a shake of his turbaned head , and fervently scribbled his notes . Hildegart followed the laboring Blemmye as he tugged at his bony , rattling burden . The Silent Master trembled like a dying ox as he hauled the big skidding carcass . His sturdy leather boots had been lacerated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds , the Blemmye dragged the riddled corpse of his beloved , yard by painful yard , down the slope toward the Dead Sea . The empty carapace was full of broken holes . The she-demon had been pecked to pieces from within . Hildegart had never seen the Blemmye hurt . But she had seen enough wounded men to know the look of mortal despair , even on a face as strange as his . The Blemmye collapsed in anguish at the rim of the sullen salt lake . Hildegart smoothed the empty sand before him with her sandaled foot . Then she wrote to him with a long brass pin from the clasp of her cloak . " Master , let us return to your Paradise . There I will tend to your wounds . " The Blemmye plucked a small table knife from his belt and scratched rapidly in the sand . " My fate is of no more consequence /1 care only for my darling 's children / though born in this unhappy place/ they are scions of a great and noble people . " " Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better place . " The Blemmye brushed away her words with the palm of his hand . " I have touched my poor beloved for the last time in my life / How pitifully rare were our meetings / We sent each other word through the black gulfs and seas amid the stars / to understand one sentence was the patient work of years / her people and mine were mortal enemies / And yet she trusted me / She chose to become mine / She fled with me in exile to this distant unknown land / Now she has left me to face our dark fate alone / It was always her dear way to give her life for others / Alas my sweet correspondent has finally perished of her generosity . " The Blemmye tugged in fitful despair at his lacerated boots . Resignedly , Hildegart knelt and pulled the torn boots from her Master 's feet . His wounds were talon slashes , fearsome animal bites . She pulled the cotton wimple from her head and tore it into strips . " I promised her that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her / That foolish vow has broken my spirit /1 will fail her in my promise , for I can not live without her / Her goodness and her greatness of spirit / She was so wise , and knew so many things / Great marvels I could never have guessed , known , or dreamed of / What a strange soul she had , and how she loved me / What wondrous things we shared together from our different worlds / Oh , how she could write ! " Sinan arrived . The Assassin 's eyes were reddened with the fumes , but he had composed himself . " What have you been doing ? " Hildegart demanded , as she worked to bind the Blemmye 's bleeding , toeless feet . " Listen to this feat of verse ! " Sinan declared . He lifted his parchment , cleared his throat , and began to recite . " " With my own eyes , I witnessed the corpses of the massacred ! Lacerated and disjointed , with heads cracked open and throats split ; spines broken , necks shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender lips were shriveled , their skulls cracked and pierced ; their feet were slashed and fingers sliced away and scattered , their ribs staved in and smashed . With their life 's last breath exhaled , their very ghosts were crushed , and they lay like dead stones among stones ! ' " Hildegart 's bloodied fingers faltered on the knot of her rough bandage . The sun beat against her bared head . Her ears roared . Her vision faded . When she came to , Sinan was tenderly sponging her face with water from his canteen . " You swooned , " he told her . " Yes , " she said faintly , " yes , that overcame me . " " Of course it would , " he agreed , eyes shining , " for those wondrous verses possessed me in one divine rush ! As if my very pen had learned to speak the truth ! " " Is that what you saw in Hell ? " she said . " Oh no , " he told her , " that was what I witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe that experience before , but just now , I was very inspired . " Sinan shrugged . " Inside that ugly mine , there is not much to see . There is dark acrid smoke there , many chewed bones . The imps within , they screeched and rustled everywhere , like bats and lizards . And that infernal stench .... " Sinan looked sidelong at the Blemmye 's wounded shins . " See how the little devils attacked him , as he walked through the thick of them , to fetch out their dam . " Though the Blemmye did not understand Sinan 's words , the tone of the Assassin 's voice seemed to stir him . He sat up , his black eyes filmy and grievous . He took up his knife again , and carved fresh letters into the sand . " Now we will take the precious corpse of my beloved / and sink her to her last rest in this strange sea she loved so much . / This quiet lake was the kindest place to her of any in your world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one whitened limb of the Blemmye 's ruined lover . The bony armor rocked and tilted like a pecked and broken Roc 's egg . The wounded Blemmye stood on his bleeding feet , lifting and shoving at the wall of bone with all his failing strength . The two of them splashed waist-deep into the evil water . As the skeleton sank into the shallows , there was a sudden stirring and skittering . From a bent corner of the shell , shaking itself like a wet bird , came a small and quite horrible young demon . It had claws , and a stinging tail , and a circlet of eyes like a spider . It hopped and chirped and screeched . Sinan wisely froze in place , like a man confronting a leopard . But the Blemmye could not keep his composure . He snorted aloud and fled splashing toward the shore . The small demon rushed after the Blemmye as if born to the chase . It quickly felled him to the salty shore . At once , it began to feed on him . Sinan armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bony flipper from the mother 's corpse . He waded ashore in a rush , and swung this bone like a mace across the heaving back of the imp . Its armor was as tough as any crab 's , though , and the heavy blow only enraged it . The little demon turned on the Assassin with awful speed , and likely would have killed a fighter less experienced . Sinan , though , was wise enough to outfox the young devil . He dodged its feral lunges , striking down and cracking the vulnerable joints in its twitching , bony limbs . When the monster faltered , foaming and hissing , he closed on it with a short , curved dagger from within his robe . Sinan rose at last from the young beast 's corpse , his robes ripped and his arm bloodied . He hid his blade away again , then dragged the dead monster to the salt shore . There he heaved it with a shudder of loathing into the still water beside its mother . Hildegart knelt beside the panting Blemmye . His wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His strength was fading visibly , yet he still had something left to write . He scraped at the sand with a trembling fingertip . " Take me to my Paradise and bind my wounds / see to it that I live /1 shall reveal to you great wonders and secrets / beyond the comprehension of your prophets . " Sinan took Hildegart by the arm . " I 'm no longer much concerned about our horses , my dear , " he told her . He knelt and smoothed out their Master 's writing . A spatter of his own blood fell on the sand beside the Blemmye 's oozings . " That ugly monster has hurt you , my brave hero ! " " Do you know how many times this poor old body of mine has known a wound ? " Sinan 's left arm had been badly scored by the creature 's lashing tail . He gritted his teeth as she tied off his arm with a scarf . " What a joy that battle was , my darling . I have never killed anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propped his headless body on one elbow . He beckoned at them feebly . Hildegart felt a moment of sheer hatred for him , for his weakness , for his foolish yieldings to the temptations of darkness . " What it is that the Blemmye wants to write of now , these " great secrets " that he promises us ? " " It will be much the same as it was before , " Sinan said with disgust . " That mystical raving about the Sun being only a star . " Hildegart shivered . " I always hated that ! " " The world is very , very old , he 'll insist on that nonsense , as well . Come , let us help him , my dear . We shall have to patch the Master up , for there is no one else fit to do it . " " Thousands of years , " Hildegart quoted , unmoving where she stood . " Then , thousands of thousands of years . And thousands , of thousands , of thousands . Then thirteen and a half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe . " " How is it you can remember all that ? Your skills at numeration are beyond compare ! " Sinan trembled suddenly from head to foot , in an aftercombat mix of rage , fear , and weariness . " My dear , please give me counsel , in your wisdom : Did his huge numbers ever make any sense to you ? Any kind of sense at all ? " " No , " she told him . The Assassin looked wearily at the fainting Blemmye . He lowered his voice . " Well , I can fully trust your counsel in this matter , ca n't I ? Tell me that you are quite sure about all that . " Hildegart felt a rush of affection for him . She recognized that look of sincere , weighty puzzlement on his face ; he 'd often looked like that in the days when they had played chess together , whiling away pleasant evenings as lord and concubine . It was Sinan who had taught her chess ; Sinan had taught Hildegart the very existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crippled Shah , and the swift Vizier , and all their valiant knights , stern fortresses and crushing elephants . When she began to defeat him at chess , he only laughed and praised her cleverness ; he seemed to enjoy their game all the more . " My dear , brave Sinan , I can promise you : God Himself does n't need such infinities , not even for His angels to dance on the heads of pins . " Hildegart felt light-headed without her wimple , and she ran her hands self-consciously across her braids . " Why does he think that numbers are some kind of reward for us ? What 's wrong with gold and diamonds ? " Sinan shrugged again , favoring his wounded arm . " I think his grief has turned his mind . We must haul him away from his darling now . We must put him to bed , if we can . No man can be trusted at the brink of his lover 's grave . " Hildegart gazed with loathing at the demonic skeleton . The dense salt water still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowning , like a boat hull riddled with holes . A dark suspicion rose within Hildegart 's heart . Then a cold fear came . " Sinan , wait one moment longer . Listen to me now . What number of evil imps were bred inside that great incubus of his ? " Sinan 's eyes narrowed . " I would guess at least a hundred . I knew that by the horrid noise . " " Do you remember the story of the Sultan 's chessboard , Sinan ? That story about the great sums . " This was one of Sinan 's Arabic tales : the story of a foolish sultan 's promise to a cheating courtier . Just one grain of wheat on the first square of the chessboard , but two grains of wheat on the second , and then four on the third , and then eight , sixteen , thirty-two . A granary-leveling inferno of numbers . Sinan 's face hardened . " Oh yes . I do remember that story . And now I begin to understand . " " I learned that story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , I well remember how we shared that tale - and I also know the size of that mine within the earth ! Ha-ha ! So that 's why he needs to feed those devils with the flesh of my precious pack horses ! When those vile creatures breed in there , then how many will there be , eh ? There will be hundreds , upon hundreds , piled upon hundreds ! " " What will they do to us ? " she said . " What else can they do ? They will spill out into our sacred homeland ! Breeding in their endless numbers , they will spread as far as any bird can fly ! " She threw her arms around him . He was a man of such quick understanding . Sinan spoke in a hoarse whisper . " So , darling , thanks to your woman 's intuition , we have found out his wicked scheme ! Our course is very clear now , is it not ? Are we both agreed on what we must do ? " " What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What , now ? " Sinan released her , his face resolutely murderous . " Yes , of course now ! To successfully kill a great lord , one must fall on him like a thunderbolt from a clear sky . The coup de grce always works best when least expected . So you will feign to help him to his feet . Then , without a word of warning , I will bury my steel blade between his ribs . " Hildegart blinked and wiped grains of salty sand from her cloak . " Does the Blemmye have ribs , Sinan ? " Sinan stroked his beard . " You 're right , my dear ; I had n't quite thought that through . " But as they conspired together , the Blemmye himself rose from the bloodstained sand . He tottered and staggered into the stinging salts of the dead lake . His darling had failed to sink entirely from sight . Half-swimming , their master shoved and heaved at the bony ridges and spars that broke the surface . The waters of the Dead Sea were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to keep above the water . He ignored their shouts and cries of warning . There he sank , tangled in the heavy bones of his beloved . Minutes later , his drowned corpse bobbed to the surface like a cork . AFTER THE DEATH of the Silent Master , life in the Holy Land took a swift turn for the worse . First , exotic goods vanished from the markets . Then trade faltered . Ordered records went unkept . Currencies gyrated in price . Crops were ravaged and villages sacked , caravans raided and ships sunk . Men no longer traded goods , or learned from one another ; they were resolved upon massacre . Defeat after wave of defeat scourged the dwindling Christian forces . Relentlessly harassed , the Crusaders lurked and starved within their stone forts , or else clung fitfully to offshore ships and islands , begging reinforcements that were loath to come . Sinan 's Moslem raiders were the first to occupy the Blemmye 's Paradise . Sinan had vaguely meant to do something useful with the place . The Assassin was a fiendish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared him greatly . But armies were low on discipline when loot was near . Soon they were breaking the plumbing , burning the libraries , and scraping at semi-precious stones with the blades of their knives . Hildegart 's own Crusader forces had arrived late at the orgy , but they were making up for lost time . The Christians had flung themselves on the Blemmye 's oasis like wolves . They were looting everything portable , and burning all the rest . Six guards dragged Hildegart into Sinan 's great black battle tent . They threw her to the tasseled carpet . The pains of battlefield command had told on the alchemist . Sinan 's face was lined , and he was thinner . But with Hildegart as his captive , he brightened at once . He lifted her to her feet , drew his scimitar , and gallantly sawed the hemp ropes from her wrists . " How astonishing life can be ! " he said . " How did you reach me amid all this turmoil ? " " My lord , I am entirely yours ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to you as the guarantee of the good behavior of his forces . " Hildegart sighed after this little set speech . Sinan seemed skeptical . " How unseemly are these times at the end of history ! Your paladin Roger offers me a Christian holy woman for a hostage ? A woman is supposed to be a pleasant gift between commanders ! Who is this " Roger of Edessa ' ? He requires some lessons in knightly courtesy . " Hildegart rubbed her chafed wrists . Her weary heart overflowed toward the Assassin in gushing confidence . " Sinan , I had to choose Roger of Edessa to command this expedition . Roger is young , he is bold , he despises death , and he had nothing better to do with himself but to venture forth and kill demonic monsters .... " Sinan nodded . " Yes , I understand such men perfectly . " " I myself forced Sir Roger to appoint me as your hostage . " " I still must wonder at his lack of gallantry . " " Oh , it 's all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger of Edessa gave me to you as a hostage because he hates me . You see , Sir Roger dearly loves my granddaughter . This granddaughter of mine is a very foolish , empty-headed girl , who , despite her fine education , also despises me bitterly . When I saw the grip that their unchaste passion had on the two of them , I parted them at once . I kept her safe in a tower in Tyre with my message birds .... Roger is a wandering adventurer , a freelance whose family fief was lost years ago . I had a much more prosperous match in mind for this young girl . However , even bread and water could not break her of her stupid habit of loving him .... It is her hand in marriage that Roger seeks above all , and for her silly kisses he is willing to face hell itself .... Do I tire you with all this prattling , Sinan ? " " Oh no , no , you never tire me , " Sinan said loyally . He sat with a weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpet . " Please do go on with your exotic Christian romance ! Your personal troubles are always fascinating ! " " Sinan , I know I am just a foolish woman and also a cloistered nun , but do grant me some credit . I , a mere nun , have raised an army for you . I armed all these wicked men , I fed them , I clothed them , I brought them here for you to kill those demons with .... I did the very best I could . " " That was a very fine achievement , sweet little Hudegar . " " I am just so tired and desperate these days . Since the dark word spread of our Silent Master 's death , all my agents have fallen to quarreling . The birds no longer fly , Sinan , the birds go neglected and they perish . And when the poor birds do arrive , they bear me the most awful news : theft , embezzlement , bankruptcies , every kind of corruption .... All the crops are burned around Tyre and Acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land .... There is famine , there is pestilence .... The clouds take the shapes of serpents , and cows bring forth monsters .... I am at my wits " end . " Sinan clapped his hands , and demanded the customary hostage cloak and hostage hat . Hildegart donned the official garments gratefully . Then Hildegart accepted a cool lime sherbet . Her morale was improving , since her Assassin was so kindly and dependable . " Dearest Sinan , I must further inform you about this ugly band I have recruited for your daring siege of Hell . They are all Christians fresh off the boat , and therefore very gullible . They are Englishmen-well , not English - they are Normans , for the English are their slaves . These are lion-hearted soldiers , and lion-gutted , and lion-toothed , with a lion 's appetites . I promised them much loot , or rather , I made Sir Roger promise them all that . " " Good . These savages of yours sound rather promising . Do you trust them ? " " Oh no , certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy war anyway , for the Tyrians would not suffer them to stay inside the port . These English are a strange , extremely violent people . They are drunken , foul , rampaging , their French is like no French I ever heard .... " Hildegart put down her glass sherbet bowl and began to sniffle . " Sinan , you do n't know what it 's been like for me , dealing with these dirty brutes . The decay of courtesy today , the many gross , impious insults I have suffered lately .... They are nothing at all like yourself , a gentleman and true scholar . " Despite all difficulty , Hildegart arranged a formal parley between Sinan and Sir Roger of Edessa . Like most of the fighters dying in the Holy Land , Roger of Edessa was a native . Roger 's grandfather had been French , his grandmother Turkish , his father German and his mother a Greek Orthodox native of Antioch . His home country , Edessa , had long since fallen in flames . Sir Roger of Edessa was a Turcopole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surcoat from Italy , and French plate armor , and a Persian peaked cavalry helmet with an Arabian peacock plume . Sir Roger 's blue eyes were full of lucid poetic despair , for he had no land to call his own . Wherever he went in the Holy Land , some blood relation was dying . The Turcopoles , the Holy Land 's only true natives , were never considered a people to be trusted by anyone ; they fought for any creed with indifference , and were killed by all with similar glee . Roger , though only twenty , had been fighting and killing since the age of twelve . With Hildegart to interpret for him , Sir Roger and his boldest Englishmen inspected their new Moslem allies . Sinan 's best efforts had raised a bare two hundred warriors to combat the fiends . Somewhere over the smoldering horizon , the mighty Saladin was rousing the Moslem faithful to fight yet another final , conclusive , epic battle with the latest wave of Western invaders . Therefore , heroic Moslem warriors willing to fight and kill demons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread widely of the uniformly lethal fate of Sinan 's suicide martyr assassins . Nevertheless , Sinan 's occult reputation had garnered together a troop of dedicated fanatics . He had a bodyguard of Ismailis from a heretical madrassa . He had a sprinkling of Fatimid Egyptian infantry and their Nubians , and some cynical Damascenes to man his siege machines . These large destructive weapons , Sinan hoped , were his keys to a quick victory . Roger examined the uncanny siege weapons with profound respect . The copper kettle-bellies of the Greek Fire machines spoke eloquently of their sticky , flaming mayhem . Much fine cedar of Lebanon had been sacrificed for the massive beams of the catapults . Roger had been educated by Templars . He had traveled as far as Paris in their constant efforts to raise money for the wars . He was incurably proud of his elegant French . " Your Excellency , my pious troops are naturally eager to attack and kill these wicked cave monsters . But we do wonder at the expense . " Hildegart translated for Sinan . Although the wily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking it . " My son , you are dealing with the Old Man of the Mountain here . " Sinan passed Roger a potent handful of diamonds . " You and your fine boys may keep these few baubles . Inspire your troops thus . When the very last of these foul creatures is exterminated within that diamond mine , then we shall make a full inventory of their legendary horde of jewels . " Roger displayed this booty to his two top lieutenants . The first was a sunburned English sea captain with vast mustaches , who looked rather uneasy stuck on horseback . The second was a large crop-headed Norman rascal , shorn of both his ears . The two freebooters skeptically crunched the jewels between their teeth . When the diamonds failed to burst like glass , they spat them out into their flat-topped kettle-helmets . Then they shared a grin . Sinan 's Assassin spies had been keeping close watch over the cave . The small war council rode there together to reconnoiter the battle terrain . Hildegart was alarmed by the sinister changes that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass and iron had been riddled with pecked holes . Fresh bones strewed the ground , along with the corpse-pale , shed outer husks of dozens of crabs . All the vegetation was gnawed and stripped , and the dusty earth itself was chewed up , as if by the hooves of stampeding cattle . Using their pennoned lances , Roger 's two lieutenants prodded at a cast-off husk of pinkish armor . Roger thoughtfully rolled a diamond through his mailed fingertips . " O Lord High Emir Commander , this place is indeed just as you told us : a very mouth of Hell ! What is our battle plan ? " " We will force the evil creatures into the open with gouts of fire . Then I place great confidence in your Christian knights who charge in heavy armor . " Sinan was suave . " I have seen their shock tactics crush resistance in a twinkling . Especially from peasants on foot . " " My English knights will likely be sober enough to charge by tomorrow , " Roger agreed . " Is our help required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small acquaintance with those in Jerusalem . " " My Damascene engineers will acquit themselves to our general satisfaction , " said Sinan . He turned his fine Arabian stallion . The party cantered from the cave . " There is also the matter of our battle signals , Your Excellency , " Roger persisted gamely . " Your minions prefer kettledrums , while my men use flags and trumpets .... " " Young commander , such a problem is easily resolved . Would you care to join me for this battle on the back of my elephant ? With those flags , horns , drums ... and our translator , of course . " Hildegart was so startled that she almost fell from her mare . " You have an elephant , Sinan ? " The Assassin caught the reins of her restive horse in his skilled hand . " My tender hostage , I brought you an elephant for the sake of your own safety . I hope you are not afraid to witness battle from atop my great beast ? " She met his eyes steadily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread Prince ! " " How good you are . " Sinan 's war elephant was the strangest creature to answer the call of his birds . The gray and wrinkled pachyderm had tramped some impossible distance , from the very shores of Hindustan maybe , arriving thirsty and lean at the Dead Sea , with his great padded feet wrapped in shabby , salt-worn leather . The elephant had many battle scars on the vast bulging walls of his hide , and a man-killing glare in his tiny red eyes . His ivory tusks were carefully grooved for the insertion of sharp sword blades . He wore thick quilted cotton armor , enough for a dozen tents . His towering sandalwood howdah had a brass-inlaid crossbow , pulled back by two stout whirring cranks , and with forty huge barbed bolts of Delhi steel , each one fit to pierce three men clean through . His Master was a very terror of the Earth . Hildegart gazed up at the vast beast and back to Sinan with heartfelt admiration . How had the Assassin managed such a magnificent gesture ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts : an ivory-handled dagger , a helmet with a visor and veil to hide her beardless face , padded underarmor , and a horseman 's long tunic of mail . It would simply not do for the common troops to see a woman taking to the battlefield . However , Sinan required her counsel , her language skills , and a written witness to events . Clad in the armor and helmet , she would pass as his boyish esquire . The dense links of greased mail crunched and rustled on Hildegart 's arms . The armor was so heavy that she could scarcely climb the folding ladder to the elephant 's gleaming howdah . Once up , she settled heavily into place amid dense red horsehair cushions , towering over the battlefield giddily , feeling less like a woman than an airborne block of oak . The battle opened with glorious bursts of colored flames . Sinan 's sweating engineers kept up a steady pace , pumping gout after gout of alchemical fire down the black throat of Hell . A half-dozen imps appeared at once at the cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than impressed by the spurts of Greek Fire . The beasts had grown larger now , and were at least the size of goats . At the sight of their uncanny capering , the cavalry horses snorted and stamped below their mailed and armored masters . A few cowards fled in shock at the first sight of such unnatural monsters , but their manhood was loudly taunted by their fellows . They soon returned shamefaced to their ranks . A drum pounded , a horn blasted , and a withering fire of crossbow bolts sleeted across the dancing crabs . In moments every one had been skewered , hopping , gushing pale ichor , and querulously plucking bolts from their pierced limbs . The men all cheered in delight . Watching through the slits in her visor , Hildegart realized that the imps had no idea that weapons could strike from a distance . They had never seen such a thing done . Sinan 's stores of Greek Fire were soon exhausted . He then ordered his catapults into action . Skilled Damascenes with great iron levers twisted the horsehide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concussive thuds , the machines flung great pottery jars of jellied Naphth deep into the hole . Sullen booms echoed within . Suddenly there was a foul , crawling clot of the demons , an antlike swarm of them , vomiting forth in pain , with carapaces wreathed in dancing flames . The creatures milled forth in an unruly burning mob . The fearless Ismaili Assassins , seeking sure reward in the afterlife , screamed the name of God and flung themselves into the midst of the enemy , blades flailing . The bold martyrs swiftly died , cruelly torn by lashing tails and pincers . At the sight of this sacrifice and its fell response , every man in the army roared with the rage for vengeance . A queer stench wafted from the monsters " burning flesh , a reek that even the horses seemed to hate . Trumpets blew . The English knights couched their lances , stood in their stirrups , and rode in shield to shield . The crabs billowed from the shock , with a bursting of their gore and a splintering of lances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell back and regrouped . Their infantry rushed forth to support them , finishing off the wounded monsters with great overhand chops of their long-handled axes . A column of black smoke began to block the sky . Then a great , choking , roiling tide of the demons burst from their filthy hole . They had been poisoned somehow , and were spewing thin phlegm from the gills on their undersides . There were hundreds of them . They leapt over everything in their path , filled with such frantic energy that they almost seemed to fly . In moments the little army was overrun , surrounded . The Damascenes died screaming at their siege machinery . Horses panicked and fell as lunging , stinging monsters bit through their knees . Stout lines of spear-carrying infantry buckled and collapsed . But there was no retreat . Not one man left the battlefield . Even those who died , fell on the loathsome enemy with their last breath . Men died in clumps , lashed , torn , shredded . At the howdah 's rear , Sir Roger pounded a drumskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slashed by things no taller than his knees , was stung into madness . With a shattering screech from his curling sinuous nose , he charged with great stiff-legged earthshaking strides into the thickest of the enemy . As the towering beast lurched in his fury , Sinan kept up a cool fire from the howdah 's crossbow . His fatal yard-long bolts pierced demons through , pinning them to the earth . A knot of angry demons swarmed up the elephant as if it were a moving mountain . The evil creatures seethed right up the elephant 's armored sides . Hildegart , quailing within her heavy helmet and mail , heard them crawling and scrabbling on the roof of the howdah as Roger and Sinan , hand to hand , lashed out around them with long bared blades . Claws caught within the steel links of her chain mail and yanked her from the howdah . Along with the demons seizing her , she tumbled in a kicking , scrambling mass from the plunging elephant . They crashed and tumbled through a beleaguered cluster of Egyptians on horseback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the foul creatures swarmed toward the great beast , their pick-like legs scrabbling over her . Chopped almost in half by the elephant 's steel-bearing tusks , a demon came flying and crashed across her . It lay on her dying , and among its many twitching legs , its broken gills wheezed forth a pale pink froth . Hildegart lay still as death , knowing that many survived battles that way . She was utterly terrified , flat on her back amid a flowing tide of jittering , chattering monsters , men 's dying screams , curses , the clash of their steel . Yet there was almost a tender peace in such stillness ... for she wanted for nothing . She only wished that she were somehow still in the howdah , together with dear Sinan , to wrap her arms around him one last time , to shield his body from his fate , even at the cost of her own life .... Suddenly , as often happened in battles , there was a weird lull . She saw the blue sky and a rising billow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her , blinded , bleeding , staggering to its death . Its great foot fell and rose swiftly . It stamped her flat , and broke her body . Coldness crept around her heart . She prayed in silence . After some vague time she opened her eyes to see Sinan 's torn and bloodied face inside his dented helmet . " The day is ours , " he told her . " We have killed all of them , save a very few that fled into the mine . Few of us survive - but none of them can be suffered to live . I have sworn a holy oath that they shall not trouble the next generation . My last two Assassins and I are walking into hell to settle them forever . We shall march into the very midst of them , laden with our very best bombs . That is a strategy that can not fail . " " I must take notes for our glorious history , " she murmured . " You must write the verses for me . I long to read them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braided hair , and carefully arranged her limbs . Hildegart could not feel her own numbed legs , but she felt him lift her mailcoat to probe her crushed flesh . " Your back is broken , precious . " With no more word than that - for the coup de grce always worked best without warning-she felt a sharp , exciting pang through her ribs . Her Assassin had stabbed her . He kissed her brow . " No gentleman would write one word about our history ! All that sweetness was our secret ; it was just for you and me . " The tattered pigeon carried an urgent message : " MY DARLING : At the evil shores of a dead sea , I have survived a siege of such blood and hellish fire that I pray that no survivor ever writes of it . My command was ravaged . All who came to this land to serve God have died for Him , and even the imps of Satan have perished , leaving nothing but cold ashes and bones . My heart now tells me : you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and woman unless we flee this dreadful Holy Land . We must seek some shelter far beyond the Gates of Hercules , or far beyond the Spice Islands , if there is any difference . We must find a place so distant no one will ever guess our origins . There I swear that I will cleave to you , and you only , until the day I die . " Trust me and prepare yourself at once , my beloved , for I am coming to take you from your tower and finally make you mine . I am riding to you as fast as any horse will carry me . Together we will vanish from all ken , so that no man or woman will ever know what became of us . " The laden pigeon left the stone sill of the window . She fluttered to the floor , and pecked at the useless husks of a few strewn seeds . The pigeon found no water . Every door hung broken from every empty cage . The tower was abandoned , a prey to the sighing wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
