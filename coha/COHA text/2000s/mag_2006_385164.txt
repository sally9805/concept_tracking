. THE LAW Go where the staff know what they 're talking about . There are too many opportunities to get sidetracked by bogus specs and useless features . Nothing but chain stores around ? Do your homework before you hit the sales floor . The gadget industry depends on your remaining ignorant . Otherwise you 'd know that contrast ratios ( a flat-screen TV spec ) are basically bunk , that megapixels in digital cameras have become almost irrelevant , and that good marketing does n't always equal good technology ( applies to everything ) . So keep your head on straight when you walk into an electronics store . Is it a small , independent operator that 's been recommended by a friend ? Avail yourself of all the reps ' professional advice  --  keeping in mind that they care for their bottom line , not yours . Larger , big-box retailers ? Do some research on your own and go there simply to buy something and carry it out of there . You ca n't count on their salespeople to steer you right . EXPERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent 1 . Never walk into a cell-phone store : Stores have poor product selection , undersupervised employees and crowds of angry people complaining about something . Do all your business either online or over the phone . 2 . You can get a new phone for free : After two years , Sprint will issue a $150 credit to you for a new handset . Verizon will cough up as much as $100 . Cingular and T-Mobile have discounts custom-tailored to each customer , so be sure to ask . 3 . Love the Motorola Razr ? Sure you do . But users complain about its clumsy user interface and frequent dropped calls . Sprint 's Samsung A900 ( shown ) is nearly as thin and easier to use . 4 . The only department you should be talking to is the cancellation department . Its representatives are empowered to keep you as a customer at almost any cost . They can change your monthly plan , offer discounts and even backdate the savings to previous statements . But they wo n't do any of this if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch movies the way they were intended to be viewed , you need to spend as much on a new plasma or LCD as you paid for your first car . REBUTTAL Flat screens are nice , but the real deal to be found is in projectors . For around $1,000 , you can get a portable model ( about the size of two Yellow Pages ) with a built-in DVD player and built-in speakers ( many come with an optional external subwoofer ) . It will display an image as big as any wall or bedsheet , and you can carry it from house to house for on-the-go screenings . VERDICT Take a look at DVD-projector combos from RadioShack ( $800 ) , Optoma ( $1,000 ) and Epson . The Epson MovieMate 25 ( $1,200 ) is a little larger than the other two , but it gives the biggest picture and best sound at close range . ITEM MUSIC DOWNLOADS AND PORTABLE PLAYER TESTIMONY There 's only one game in town : Apple . Its iPod and its iTunes Music Store are the absolute best way to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lousy . REBUTTAL Apple 's setup is mighty fine , but it is n't for everyone . Parents who worry that their children will bankrupt them with download fees ( and do n't want to have to deal with iTunes " allowances " ) may want to consider paying $15 a month for one of the subscription music services . They let you download as much music as you want so long as you maintain the subscription . VERDICT The best subscription service out there right now is from MTV and is called Urge . It has the latest music , thanks to the network 's running knowledge of what 's hot . While you ca n't use an iPod with Urge , there are some amazing little players out there that are compatible . Creative 's cute Zen V was designed to compete with Apple 's iPod Nano , and it costs $30 to $50 less . Best of all , everyone can share in the all-you-can-eat pricing model : Up to five PCs and three players can receive downloads . Reference <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
