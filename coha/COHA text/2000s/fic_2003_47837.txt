Rod Garcia 's wonderful fantasy tales of Markovy ( of which " The Bone Witch " in our last February issue was the most recent ) continue to delight both fans and critics . His latest adventure might have a forbidding title , but in truth it 's one of his most rousing tales yet . <p> Sister Ida HELENA WAS THE BRAVEST person Natasha ever knew , the most joyous and most alive , and now Helena was dead . Natasha could barely believe it , sitting on the stone floor of her tiny nun 's cell , her head in her hands , short black hair showing between her white fingers , her bony elbows resting on bent knees . Having given up her habit , Natasha sat in her linen shift , shivering from cold and dread - for right now men were deciding how she too should die - though somehow the enormity of a world without Helena eclipsed even her own doom . Natasha 's life was so entwined with Helena 's that since Helena had died , it seemed totally natural she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , Helena had been her life and hope , the spark lighting her way , - with Helena she had always been among the chosen elite , living in the eye of the storm . Helena had raised her to the heights of excitement , awakening her to love , music , dance , religion , adventure , jealousy , and now nauseating despair ; first as playmates and best friends , then as mistress and maidservant , then lady and confessor , and finally murderess and accomplice . And ever since age twelve they had been illicit lovers as well , a secret shared only with God . Now the secret was out and Helena was dead , brave willful Helena D'Hay , with her honey-gold hair and wild mocking smile , who had been by turns the spoiled brat , the boyar 's daughter , then the young lady , and the teenage baroness . D'Brovniks had taken Helena to unconsecrated ground , tied her to a stake , then stoned her to death for adultery and murder . What a sad hideous thought . Natasha had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoned her alongside Helena , but she was a nun , untouchable without Church permission . Right now , Baron D'Brovnik was hectoring her bishop for the right to carry out the sentence . Natasha prayed the old bishop would hold firm , hoping Mother Church would find a way to kill her . She was already eternally grateful she did not have to see Helena die . When the lock finally turned , she looked up , relieved to see veiled nuns had come for her , wearing long white habits trailing to the ground . Her heart lifted , happy to be in the hands of nuns , who whispered softly to her from behind the veils , " Be strong , daughter . Be strong and obey . " Hearing herself called " daughter " showed how far Natasha had fallen - no longer a " sister , " just an unfortunate in their care . Still , it felt good to walk between cool protective pillars of white cloth that seemed to glide over the polished floors of the great wooden church . When Natasha reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had never given up her habit and veil and let her hair grow out . Men in blue and black D'Brovnik livery lined the walls , all of them eyeing her , the only figure not hidden in fabric . She kept her eyes downcast , knowing the D'Brovnik retainers were here to see she got a death sentence for aiding Helena 's rash , hopeless rebellion . They came armed and ready , fearing the Church might find some absurd reason to spare a defenseless teenage girl who had harmed no one , and merely obeyed her doomed mistress . Bishop Cyrus was a gaunt , devout man of God dressed in cloth-of-silver and standing before the high altar , holding aloft his silver crosier as a sign for silence . Ignoring the crowd of retainers , clerics , nuns , and onlookers that filled the carved and polished cathedral , he asked Natasha , " Daughter , do you understand the charges against you ? " She nodded , well understanding why she was there . " Yes , Father . I do . " " And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked old Bishop Cyrus . She nodded again , saying , " I most faithfully submit . " Holy Church could not shed blood , but there were ways around the ban , particularly when secular justice would be much worse . Fasting to death was a woman 's favorite , a serene contemplative end , especially compared to being flogged barefoot through the streets to a burning stake . But whatever Mother Church devised for her was vastly better than being handed over to Helena 's killers . " Our judgment is that you must be reduced from nun to novice , and your penance shall be to present yourself as the summer offering at Karadyevachka , the Shrine of the Black Maiden in Nordling . " Natasha had heard all the scary childhood stories of upcountry Old Rite shrines that still performed virgin sacrifices . Dark grim temples to Death , where young girls were done away with in secret . Helena had a mania for such tales , swearing they were true - now Natasha would find out . Nuns whispered , " Be brave . Submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded silently . Bishop Cyrus softened , saying , " Do you know you will be giving yourself up to Heaven ? " That was for the D'Brovniks , so they would see she went knowingly to her doom . Nuns nudged her , and Natasha answered as loud as she could , " I do . " Baron D'Brovnik himself was there to hear her say it , a big , murderous , crafty-eyed boyar with speckled gray in his beard , wearing half-armor even in a house of God . Sneaking a look out the corner of her eye , she saw Helena 's stern father-in-law was vastly irritated at her getting off so easily , sentenced to some vague far-off death in a northern shrine . D'Brovniks had ruled the lands within the bend in the Brovva longer than anyone could remember , and the baron could barely believe the Church was coddling a rebel just because she was a nun . He ached to see her broken by his own hand-anything less was a compromise with Mother Church . He clearly wished he could just call in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangled on the spot . After pronouncing formal sentence , Bishop Cyrus blessed her for being brave . Natasha did not feel brave at all , being wretchedly frightened , but she gladly accepted the bishop 's blessing , sure she would need it . Nuns stepped up to take her away , surrounding her with quiet swishing fabric . As they led her off , Natasha was startled to see the men 's bearded faces had changed completely . When she was led in they were smirking , enjoying the sight of a fallen nun , barefoot in a smock with her hair growing out . Now their scorn and contempt had turned to pity - all they saw was a small teenage girl being led away to a dark mysterious end , a death so secret it could only be imagined . Which felt strange , since Natasha was delighted with how things had gone , happy to be back in the care of nuns . If she had to be done to death , how much better that it be done at a later date , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's hands . But men feared most what they could not see . In fact , Natasha enjoyed a newfound serenity knowing her doom was moved to Nordling . Before coming to live here in Brovazamak , she had never been more than twenty miles from home in her whole life . Now they could not kill her until they got her to Nordling ; she had the Holy Church 's word on that . Being slated for sacrifice meant that for the first time in her life no man - not even Baron D'Brovnik - could hurt her , not without striking a blow against Heaven . Miraculous indeed . Clasping her hands , she took a moment to silently thank the Almighty . Life slipped into a strange sort of suspension , without Helena to give it turmoil and direction , telling her which rules to live by and which to break . Not even a nun anymore , Natasha no longer had prayers and chores to occupy her . Travel became her main distraction , since her last and longest journey began at once , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Bishop Cyrus saw her off , sending her up the Browa in a bullock-car , a little wooden bedroom on wheels , which she shared with a kindly young nun from Nordling named Sister Ida . The bullock driver and his boy rode on the roof , and they were escorted by three " lances " from Baron D'Brovnik 's household cavalry , each lance consisting of a man-at-arms , squire , and two mounted bowmen , making a dozen armed riders , all ordered to see she got to the Shrine of the Black Maiden in Nordling before the first day of summer . Winding through flat steppe north and east of the capital , the Browa watered the heart of Markovy , fertile black earth grainlands dotted with tiny hamlets and onion-domed churches . Here in central Markovy , tall luxuriant feather-grass had grown for untold millennia , storing nutrients in its matted roots , leaving deep black layers of humus so rich and thick that it was carted away for fertilizer on less fortunate plots . Serfs in the vast open fields touched their brows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clattering escort of armed riders , while inside , Natasha and Sister Ida lived in unaccustomed comfort , reclining on cushions or the single bed , and cooking their meals on the small iron stove . Sister Ida was a prim pinch-faced nun from Nordling in her mid-twenties who said her prayers religiously . Otherwise they had no schedule to keep and no one watching over them , leaving them free to talk , and loll , and watch flat countryside roll past , broken only by tall trees along the river . Sister Ida turned out to be pious and sympathetic , from a landholding serf family like Natasha 's . Ida 's father thought her too plain for marriage , and put her in a nunnery instead . " Best thing that could have happened to me , " Ida declared , crossing herself enthusiastically . " Our Almighty 's hand at work . " Natasha thought of how Helena had talked her into becoming a nun , making it seem like her holy duty . Too bad the habit did not take . That first night , camped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not sleep , haunted by images of what might happen to her , everything from suttee to ritual strangulation . Finally she got up the courage to ask Ida , " What do you know about the shrine at Karadyevachka ? " Heaving a sigh , Ida said a silent prayer , then opened a jar of plum wine , poured a healthy jolt into a wooden cup . As nuns , they naturally shared utensils , thinking it sinful to use two cups when one would do . Secure in their lamp-lit traveling room on a warm May night , Ida had taken off her veil and habit ; sitting in a linen shift , with the wooden cup in her hands , her head and eyebrows shaved , she looked more like a starved Buddha than a young woman in her twenties . Natasha was wearing a silk slip that had belonged to Helena . " I have never been there , " Sister Ida admitted , solemnly handing Natasha the cup , " but girls do go there . Not every year , but they do go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steady herself , finding it sweet and heady . " And do not come back ? " Pouring more plum wine into the cup , Sister Ida stroked Natasha 's cheek , saying quietly , " Take another drink . " Surprised by the nun 's touch , Natasha obeyed , asking suspiciously , " Are you getting me drunk ? " " Yes . " Sister Ida smiled good-naturedly . " It is part of the Old Rite . Some things are not meant to be heard sober . " Taking another swallow , Natasha thought of the girls who had gone before her , each getting drunk before she learned her fate . " Did you know any of them ? " " Some . " Sister Ida 's smile vanished , and she took a sip herself , staring sadly into the carved wooden cup . " Who were they ? " Natasha asked , already feeling like one of them . " What were they like ? " " Most had no choice . " Sister Ida handed the cup back , resting her hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to the shrine . And my best friend 's little sister Katelyn was stricken with a wasting disease . When it was sure she would die , she offered herself at the shrine , not wanting her family to see her suffer . My last memory of Katelyn is her turning to wave to us before hobbling off , headed for the shrine , proud to have something to do with her lost life . Sometimes strangers from afar would offer themselves , infanticides , suicides , and the like . One spring I remember an older girl with a refined Markov accent coming to our home , politely asking my mother directions to the shrine , then thanking us and going on , without any word of explanation . " Thankful for the plum wine , Natasha took a deep swallow , drinking to that unknown city girl . " What happened to them ? " " Noone knows . " Sister Ida shook her head , saying , " The secret name for the Black Maiden of Karadyevachka is the Killer of Children . Since the shrine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken to the top and thrown off . Or devoured there by wild rocs . " Some choice . Taking a swig , Natasha told her , " I know which I would pick . " " At least you will not drown . " Sister Ida patted Natasha 's knee , then poured more plum wine in the cup , asking gently , " Why are you offering yourself ? " Wine had gone to her head , making Natasha unsure what to say . " Love , I guess . And fear of what the D'Brovniks would do to me . " " But what was your crime ? " Sister Ida asked , giving her hand a comforting squeeze . " Love , too , " Natasha laughed ruefully , " and willful disobedience . " Sister Ida looked at her askance . " What sort of love ? " " The wrong sort , " Natasha acknowledged , embarrassed by how perverted her love life would sound . Sister Ida smiled and tushed her , saying , " Is there any other kind ? " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sordid story . " When I was a maidservant , I fell in love with my mistress , Lady Helena D'Hay , sister to Lord Valad D'Hay . It was not hard , Helena was insanely beautiful , and we had been best friends since girlhood . But most of all Helena wanted it , and whatever Helena wanted , Helena got . It was wonderful at first , our secret paradise , a soft loving sanctuary from the world . Then the world came crashing in , and Helena was given in marriage as a peace offering to Baron D'Loy , the son and heir of Baron D'Brovnik . When she first got the news , Helena wanted us to run away together disguised as gypsies , but then she got the brilliant notion of making me a nun , and her confessor . " " So you became her lover and her confessor . " Sister Ida nodded her approval . " Incredibly convenient . " Sort of . " Helena insisted on making true confession , not wanting to lie to the Almighty , and I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well all around . Some confessions got to be real giggle fests - but hearing every wayward thought Helena had , and the lurid details of every sin committed by your beloved does get tiring . " " I do not doubt it , " Sister Ida agreed with her , though no true nun could know the half of it . Shameless and unrestrained , Helena once knelt down and performed an indecent oral act on a surprised and embarrassed stable boy , before strolling off to kiss her hated husband good-bye . " But the world would never just let us be , " Natasha complained , tears welling up , angry and amazed at how casually her life was destroyed . " Helena was a peace offering from the D'Hays , and the peace did not hold . War broke out between D'Brovniks and D'Hays , and Helena became the enemy , demoted in the family and snubbed by her in-laws who maneuvered to annul the marriage . When she protested , her husband beat her and took a mistress . So Helena said fine , and annulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to wed in the first place . " Natasha shuddered at that ghastly scene , and at the whipping Helena got for it - Markovite marriages were solemnized by the bride kissing her husband 's dog whip as a sign of submission . Afterward Natasha had put salve on the welts , terrified by the hurt they had done to her love 's smooth white body , fearing what would come next . Even alone and unarmed in the enemy camp Helena would not give in . " Helena swore she would never be raped , and when her husband did it , she fought back and killed him , using the knife he had held at her throat . She came to me with bruises on her face and blood on her hands - then we did run , disguised as a modest veiled merchant 's wife and her eunuch groom . " Natasha wiped her eyes and smiled , saying , " I got to play the eunuch , and did rather well . " Ida applauded and poured more plum wine . " You must have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Natasha bobbed her head in a drunken bow . " But we were caught , and the last time I saw Helena was at her sentencing . When they announced she would be stoned to death , Helena blew me a kiss . " At that Natasha broke down and cried big huge sobs , missing her friend horribly , glad that the Church was taking her to die . Sister Ida put an arm around her , drawing Natasha to her , saying , " Yet you are still alive . " " Temporarily . " Natasha tried to stifle her sobs . " As are we all , " Sister Ida reminded her , using the silk hem of Helena 's slip to dry Natasha 's tears . " And in the time you have left , you must separate what is you and what is Helena , and celebrate what is you . For there is much to celebrate . You are brave , and loyal , and honest , and loving . " With each attribute Sister Ida wiped away another tear , ending with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leaning forward , Sister Ida kissed her long and tenderly on the lips . Ida 's mouth tasted cool and wet , and a little like plum wine . Drunk as she was , Natasha had seen this coming , but had already decided to kiss back - if this was her last journey , she did not want to spend it alone , pining for Helena . Though Natasha was not at all attracted to Sister Ida , the nun clearly wanted this , and had been marvelously kind and understanding , lifting her spirits immensely . Which certainly merited a kiss . When their lips parted , Sister Ida looked into her eyes , saying contritely , " I can not save you . " " I know . I do not expect you to . " Natasha 's problem was not salvation , but the nun 's body , which was firm and lean and not the least like Helena . With Helena it had been all soft warm curves and clouds of golden hair , but Ida 's older harder body and shaven head seemed more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been with a man , making it hard to judge . Natasha had never been with anyone but Helena . But right now Sister Ida 's firm hand on her bare hip felt good , and Natasha ached to open herself to life , to feel new things , and another 's touch , even if it was only for a while . All she said was , " I have never made love to a nun before . " " It is not that hard , " Sister Ida whispered , shedding her scratchy nun 's shift , revealing a reassuringly female body . Sliding a hand inside Natasha 's silk slip , Sister Ida 's fingers followed the curve of flesh , finding the hollow between Natasha 's thighs . Sister Ida whispered , " Here , I will show you how . " And she did . WAKING TO THE GENTLE SWAY of the wagon , amid sunlight falling through the small glass windows , Natasha felt warm and hungover . They were moving , headed up the Brovva toward Nordling . From her bed she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bluest sky ever , full of spring songbirds trilling to the new day . Lying tangled in the nude body of the nun , Natasha knew she was seeing a whole new world as well . How new was apparent when they stopped to water the oxen , and she put on a dress to pee . As she squatted by the wagon , a squire came up , asking if she wanted water from the river . This question nearly floored Natasha , who had never had a man draw water for her , much less a boyar 's squire . Flustered , she nodded her head , and he trotted off to oblige . Then a Kazak bowman came up , offering her hot tea , followed by a groom with biscuits . In no time the squire was back with a bucket of water , and soap to go with it , scented soap , smelling of lavender . Sitting by the wagon , nibbling her biscuits and sipping tea , she had a steady trickle of men come up to do her favors , or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a criminal , the men were caught up in the drama of her sacrifice ; everything she did seemed to touch them deeply , no matter how simple or ordinary . She found she could walk freely among these strange armed men , drawing nothing but shy smiles , like she was a little sister , or a secret sweetheart . No lewd come-ons , no attempts to fondle her , nor drag her into the brush , just ready helpfulness that would rapidly turn to lust - but only if she let it . Utterly amazing . And she could have whatever she wanted . Natasha had meant to bathe in the river , but when she asked instead for hot water , men stumbled over each other to obey . Sister Ida brought out a wooden tub and Natasha had a glorious hot bath in the spring air . Squires and bowmen applauded when she doffed her dress and slip , then they lined up to lift heavy buckets , pouring heated water over her while she washed . Standing under the warm cascade , rubbing herself with scented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men 's admiring eyes . Born a serf , Natasha had been bathing in front of men since she was a little girl , but all the time she was with Helena , men 's gaze seemed to pass right over her ; now it was her turn to be looked at , and applauded , and vainly lusted after . These men would have gotten the same show if she had bathed in the river , only they would never have thought to work for it , nor even to applaud . So it went , all the way up the Brovva . Each morning she awoke to another new world , another vast landscape that she would never see again . Black earth steppe stretched in all directions , grainfields so immense it barely felt like the wagon was moving . Twice , walled towns loomed in the distance , but each time they passed them by , headed for the highlands of Nordling . Finally , after days of travel , endless flats turned to rolling hill country carved by ancient glaciers , a low undulating landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tiny islands of forest appeared , the first signs of the great sea of trees lying to the north and east . And each night she slept with Sister Ida . Men at morning wash paid scant attention to the nun in her habit and veil , but at night Ida became the ugly duckling who got to sleep with the swan . And Natasha was now the swan , bright and doomed like Helena had been - while Sister Ida was the one in love . But being the swan was not nearly the same thing as being with one . Natasha had slept with Helena out of blind overwhelming love for the most beautiful thing in her world , but she slept with Sister Ida out of fear and loneliness , craving shelter from men 's dangerous admiration . Was that how Helena had felt about her ? Maybe . Though in other ways she was wildly different from Helena . One night she told Sister Ida , " It seems strange to die , never having been with a man . " " Why ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cup of plum wine in gratitude . " Thank Heaven , I was not pretty enough . " " You are a nun , " Natasha pointed out , " you are expected not to . " Being a fallen nun but still never knowing a man seemed fundamentally unfair . Sister Ida shrugged . " It is supposed to be a virgin sacrifice , but why stand blindly on tradition ? Get one of them alone - whichever you fancy - you see how they look at you . Then you can tell me what it is like ; but do it soon , for we are nearing the borders of Nordling . " Dire news . Nonetheless Natasha hesitated , though she certainly had nothing to save herself for . Something Helena would never have done . Closing her eyes , Natasha could picture Helena 's big blonde smile as she happily took her pick . Three lances of household cavalry had small chance of ever sacrificing Helena - two days down the road , and she would have had the lot of them marching off to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'Brovniks had to stone her to death . Next morning Natasha had an unexpected reminder of D'Brovnik power , seeing the last D'Hay stronghold on the Browa , Hebektahay Castle , the Bride of the D'Hays , being beset by the baron 's troops . Sited on a high outcropping above the far bank of the Brovva , Hebektahay was virtually impregnable with three fortified wards ringing an inner keep , and further defended by a big bend in the river . D'Brovniks had taken the town and outworks , isolating the castle , then brought up catapults , trebuchets , and ballista , erecting a huge earth platform on the single landward side , to fire down into the outer ward . At the same time , miners brought by boats tunneled into the riverbank , trying to bring down one of the middle ward towers . Miserable serf families , turned out of the castle to conserve rations , pleaded for food from passing boats . D'Brovniks would not let them through the lines , hoping the castle would take them back , reducing the defender 's larder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies , begging the boatmen to take them . Two days later , they reached the final ford on the Brovva , and Sister Ida nodded at the dark wooded uplands across the river , saying , " That is Nordling . " Looking over the broad brown river , Natasha saw the land of her doom , the ancient homeland of the Markovites , boreal hills that sheltered her people until they were brave enough to come down onto the plains , driving off the Kazaks and Kipchaks , then pushing back the Poles and Baits , claiming the rich black earth as their own . On the far side , hamlets got fewer and farther apart , separated by high ridgelines and forest belts but the people got friendlier . At their first stop in Nordling , women and children met the wagon , offering her flowers and the first fruits of spring . When Natasha took the food and flowers , people cheered , and she asked Sister Ida why . " Because you have offered yourself , " the nun replied . " For the children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Natasha clutched the flowers and smiled to the crowd . " These are simple folks , " Sister Ida explained . " To them the Black Maiden is a protector of children , and Karadyevachka is her shrine . Girls hereabouts who give themselves to the shrine , do it to help keep children from harm - so they assume you are doing the same . It is a harmless folk heresy tolerated by the Church . " Natasha saw shy loving gratitude in people 's faces , knowing she was giving her life for them and their children , while they had only these poor offerings in return . This shy , worshipful look got stronger the deeper they went into Nordling . Mothers brought her smiling toddlers to bless , and babies to kiss , calling out blessings to her in return . Little girls solemnly offered her their rag dolls , which she kissed but did not keep . Having everyone always happy to see her , giving her little greeting gifts and showing every concern for her comfort , became like a narcotic . Hugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits , making her feel she really was special , destined for some grand mysterious purpose . These joyful , solicitous hillfolk certainly thought so . They would have gladly let her have whatever she wanted - except to turn back . Karadyevachka Shrine sat at the base of a tall wooded crag , a black-timbered hall built in typical Markovite fashion with low eaves and carved doorposts , set right up against the hill , blending into the ground and shaded by aged oaks . Veiled nuns filed out of the shrine to meet them , singing as they came , carrying a caged pigeon and a big two-handed silver cup . When Natasha stepped out of the wagon door in her white sacrifical gown to greet the singing nuns , flower-decked squires and bowmen went down on their knees , crying and kissing her hand . These former D'Brovnik retainers had by now become her honor guard , fiercely loyal and heartbroken to lose her . Seeing the dark shrine waiting for her sobered Natasha up , but there was a ready remedy for that . Ending their song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver cup they carried , telling her to drink . Natasha did , finding it was sweet fruit wine , sugared so children would like it . She realized these were her last sober moments - the nuns meant to get her drunk , just like Sister Ida did that first night in the wagon . Old Rite ritual really did call for it . Saying a silent prayer for the girls who came before her , Natasha drank deeply . Giving her the caged pigeon , the nuns told her to set it free ; which she did , to a chorus of cheers . Happy to be free of the tiny cage , the pigeon shot off , disappearing over the trees . Good luck , Natasha thought , wishing to heaven she could fly off that easily . Having wisely said their good-byes in the wagon , she and Sister Ida exchanged a chaste kiss , though tears were pouring down the nun 's cheek . Already tipsy , Natasha told the nun not to fret . " I am feeling fine , really . " But Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a hard time letting go . Looking toward the oak-shaded shrine , Natasha too had second thoughts , suggesting , " More wine ? " Sister Ida brought her the cup , and held it while she drank . Feeling the wine go to her head , Natasha signaled when she had enough to send her on her way . By now she knew she had to make the walk to the shrine alone - everyone expected it . Her throat tightened , and unable to speak , she nodded good-bye to the world . Feeling both frightened and giddy , she set out silently up the path toward the dark shrine , drunken feet starting to drag . These were the last steps in her long journey , and in her life as well . How sad and strange , coming all this way and making all these new friends , only to die at the end - but none of these friendly worshipful folks were giving her any choice . She thought of Helena blowing her a good-bye kiss , and all the girls who had walked this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice . Built from ancient oiled timbers , stained black by time , Karadyevachka Shrine had a fancifully carved front with fiery salamanders climbing the door posts , trying to catch brightly colored birds . Carved trolls looked out from under black eaves , guarding the blue-painted door . Natasha did not have to be drunk to feel like she had stepped into a weird fairy story from her girlhood - a scary one , for inside lived the Killer of Children . Turning at the painted door , framed by the carved troll faces , she waved to the armed men and nuns , blowing them a kiss . Folks cheered , and she went in , leaving the daylight behind . Darkness enveloped her , warm , wet , and smelling of sulfur , filled with the sound of water dripping on stone . Unable to see , she felt blind panic rising inside her , remembered Sister Ida saying , " At least you will not drown . " Natasha did not want to die gasping for breath with stinking sulfur water filling her face and nose ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dim light falling through the shrine 's smokehole , and she saw that Karadyevachka Shrine was built over a natural hot spring . Big rocks sat at odd angles embedded in the dirt floor , surrounding a warm simmering pool that smelled of brimstone . Seated on one of the rocks was an incredibly old woman with tangled white hair and a wrinkled toothless face . Lifting blind eyes , the old woman reached out a withered hand , whispering , " Come here girl . Do not be afraid . " Natasha obeyed , walking over and taking the crone 's hand , wondering what would come next ; up close , she could see that below the sightless eyes , the old woman had parchment-thin skin stretched over fine beautiful bones . When young she must have been lovelier than Helena . Feeling Natasha 's face , the woman asked gently , " What is your name ? " " Natasha . " She stood still , listening to water lap on stone , letting the blind old woman feel her . " How old are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As she was a serf , no one had kept accurate track of her birth date , least of all Natasha . " You are a brave girl , " the old woman informed her . " I feel it in your face . Do not worry , here you will just be purified . Have you been with a man , or ever shed innocent blood ? " Saying no to both , Natasha told enough of Helena 's story to explain how she got here . The crone asked if helping Helena flee did not make her an accomplice . " Only in self-defense , " Natasha insisted , standing up for Helena . " Helena was attacked at knife point , and choked into submission , waking up with him atop her and the knife stuck in the floorboards beside her head . She grabbed it before he could , or it would have been used on her . " " Enough . " The blind crone held up her hand . " I see well why they sent you here . Purify yourself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcanic water , and when she was done and dressed , the old woman had a goblet of wine waiting . Handing her the goblet , she told Natasha , " Drink . We both sit on the brink of death - but you must face it today . " Taking a sip , Natasha whispered , " What will happen to me ? " " We will walk together to the top of the crag , " the crone explained , " where I will leave you to await the Destroyer . " Natasha took a hurried gulp , asking , " What destroyer ? " Laying a hand on Natasha 's head , the blind woman ran frail fingers through the girl 's short black hair . " Be brave , my sweet . Though I have served this shrine for seventy years , I do not know what form the Killer of Children takes . " No longer as drunk as she wanted to be , Natasha took another great gulp . " Will I see Helena ? " " I do not know that either , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death we do not know , even when we sit at her door . Come , you can bring the cup . " With that the old woman led her out the back of the dark shrine across a green-banked stream , and up the dusty path to the peak , a dizzying climb for a drunk girl and a blind crone . Natasha saw huge swaths of Nordling through gaps in the trees , green forested hills cut by swift streams , with cottony clouds towering overhead . Halfway up , Natasha finished off the wine . And a little farther along , she lost the goblet , but the old woman told her not to worry . So Natasha did not , having other things on her mind . Near the top it struck her that she was still a virgin , a strange thought , but somehow apropos . Damn , she had meant to do something about that . It certainly could not be helped now - one of life 's great mysteries was just going to remain one . Coming on a wide flat spot ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " Here . " " Here ? " Natasha looked around , realizing this high grassy meadow was the last place she would ever see . " Yes , " the aged priestess replied , giving her a withered kiss . " Say hello to Death for me , for I shall be seeing her soon . " Turning away , the crone tottered back down the trail , feeling her way with a stick . Leaving Natasha drunk and alone near the edge of the cliff , taking a last bleary look at the world . Edging up to the drop , she glanced down , teetering alarmingly , seeing straight down to the steppe . If she did not like the look of this Killer of Children , she could always jump . Backing away carefully , she sat down on the grass , scared and lonely , wishing she had more wine to drink . Wishing even more she had Helena with her . Why did she have to face this alone ? Because Helena had already endured far worse - that was why . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natasha froze . Whatever made the shadow had to be huge . Looking up , she saw a giant female roc circling overhead . Killer of Children ? This monster roc could hunt tigers , with its needle-sharp talons and terrible curved beak . All her carefully hoarded courage evaporated . Drunk or sober , she did not want to be ripped to pieces by a gigantic bird of prey . Staggering to her feet , she tried to make for the cliff , aiming to launch herself into space , preferring the stones below to being pecked apart by a huge bird . But the great bird was too quick , dropping down to land in a thundering flutter of wings , cutting her off from the edge . Shrinking back , Natasha stared up at the giant raptor , petrified by its cruel curved beak . Up close she saw the twelve-foot-tall roc wore a leather hood , with silk reins running to a saddle on the bird 's back . Sitting in the saddle was a blonde young woman with a beautiful face , wearing embroidered silk pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a silver moon-bow , and a quiver full of colorfully feathered arrows . Venom rings flashed in the sunlight on her slim fingers , giving her the touch of death . Looking levelly at Natasha , the young woman told her , " I am the Destroyer , Persephone , Killer of Children . Who are you ? " Persephone " NATASHA , " SHE REPLIED meekly , amazed by the form the Killer of Children had taken . Persephone was a fearful presence , with her silver moon-bow , bird of prey , and flashing venom rings , but she was also a young woman , not much older than Natasha , with a lovely serene face and alert blue eyes . That contrast was startling in Natasha 's drunken state , and all she could think to ask was a trite and direct , " Have you come here to kill me ? " Persephone 's lips curved up in a slight smile . " Did you come here to die ? " " Yes , " Natasha admitted , though she was not a fanatic about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Persephone 's smile widened , and she asked , " Then what are you doing here ? " What indeed ? Drunk as she was , Natasha had no ready answer . What was she doing in this far-off comer of Nordling , where she had never been before , talking to a scary blonde woman on a giant bird ? That did not even make sense sober . " I am not sure . " Cocking an eyebrow , Persephone asked , " Then you are not a jumper ? " " A jumper ? " Natasha looked nonplussed . Persephone nodded at the drop behind her . " You were headed for the cliff when I landed . " " Only because your bird frightened me , " Natasha explained brightly - it still did , but not as much . " Seems a thin excuse to commit suicide , " Persephone sniffed . " You must have more reason than that . Are you perhaps fatally diseased ? Or in intolerable pain ? " Natasha was not feeling the least pain . " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the more reason to live , " Persephone laughed . " So why are you here ? " Natasha told her story , or the highlights at least ; Helena 's marriage from hell , and becoming a nun , then a fugitive , a eunuch , and finally a prisoner , her choice of stoning or sacrifice , her long trip here ( minus sleeping with Sister Ida ) , and her brief inebriated stay at the shrine - proud that she could get the story out in her present state . " And you loved this Helena ? " Persephone asked , eyeing her carefully . " With all my heart . " It felt good to say it . Her love for Helena always had to be a deep secret , and the whole time they were together Natasha had never told a soul - not even when they beat and starved her . Now she could proclaim it to the world from atop this crag above the steppe , loud as she wanted , in the face of Death herself . " Helena was my truest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mightily . " Persephone smiled at her enthusiasm . " Well , can you live without her ? " " If I have to , I suppose . " It was not Natasha 's first choice , though if she must , she must . It seemed horribly unfair to finally proclaim her love , then have to give it up . " Get on behind me , " Persephone told her , nodding toward the back of her saddle . " What ? " Natasha stared at Persephone 's high perch , hardly believing what she was hearing . " It is that or go over the edge . " Persephone indicated the drop behind her . " But I will never be able to get up there . " Besides she was afraid of the bird , but too scared to say so . " Then choose the cliff , " Persephone suggested . " Death is easy , life is difficult . " And then some . Natasha gingerly stepped up to the giant bird , grabbing the rear of the saddle . Why did she have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greedily begged more wine , Natasha cleared her head with a deep breath , then hoisted herself aboard the bird . Unbelievable . When she first saw this giant bird , not in her most drunken imagining did she think to end up on its back . She did not have much of a seat , a small pad on the back of the saddle , with her bent knees resting on Persephone 's hips , her arms went around the Killer of Children 's waist . Close contact ended any doubts about Persephone being real , or anything but what she seemed , a young woman in harem pants , not much older nor bigger than Natasha . What else she was , Heaven only knew . Leaning forward , Persephone urged the bird into the air . Spreading her wings , the roc obeyed , launching them off the cliff edge in a gut-wrenching dive to gain speed , then soaring outward , catching a thermal off a dark patch of fallow , spiraling upward . Natasha got a dizzying view of Nordling spread out below her , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut by shining loops of river . Hawks circled below them , hunting for mice on the fallow . Natasha wondered if she were headed for the Land Beyond , without the messy business of dying assuming she did not slip and spatter herself on the steppe . Summoning up her courage , she asked Persephone , " Where are we headed ? " " Home , " Persephone replied , and the bird seemed to take it as a command , skimming off along a low ridgeline until she found a new updraft . Circling and rising , the roc climbed atop the thermal , then set out for the next one , headed for the black earth steppe . By coasting from thermal to thermal , the roc carried her double load southward out of Nordling , winging toward the broad flat plain of the Brovva . Ahead of them a black dot hung in the air , far out over the flood plain . Natasha watched the dot grow in size , become a huge silver gas-filled parasail , with a skyship hanging from it , a sleek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan on each side and a tiny aft cabin topped by a pigeon coop . Black grapples hung from the keel ballast tanks . This was something else out of fairy stories - a skyship sailing along before a steady north wind , headed farther out over the flats . She watched in silent fascination as the roc flew them through the control lines between the ship and the inflated parasail , landing on a tall perch directly amidships . " Back so soon ? " asked a cultured male voice below them . " What have you found this time ? " " Help her down and see , " Persephone suggested , sliding her roc 's hood closed so the bird could rest . Natasha found herself being plucked from the saddle by a man who had climbed the perch to get her . He was tall and blonde and beautifully built , wearing a white page 's uniform with gold hearts on his sleeve . His handsome face looked remarkably like Persephone 's , but he was all man and handled her easily , setting her down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is this beautiful catch ? " " Be nice , Eros , " Persephone warned , swinging down out of her saddle . " She is merely a girl . " Eros shook his blond locks , laughing , " There is no such thing as " merely a girl . " Look at her , young and tender , and already drunk - you should have sent me to collect her . " Letting go of her arms , he bowed , saying , " I am Eros , God of Love . Welcome aboard the Selene . What is my lovely maid 's name ? " " Natasha , " she replied shyly , still not sure on her feet , and glad to have this friendly handsome God of Love ready to grab her - if needed . Eros was easily the most impressive man to show even casual interest in her , polite , affable , and eager to put a smile on her face . " Delighted to meet you too . " Persephone took her by the arm , saying , " He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . Come , I will show you our quarters . " Guiding her to the aft cabin , the Killer of Children pulled back a paper door , revealing a light airy room with cushioned window seats along each wall , and a curtained garderobe in the rear . Two caged pigeons stared back at her from behind tiny wooden bars . Seating her on a cushion , Persephone apologized , " Sorry about Eros , but he is all boy , as well as a semi-divine . Still , he has his uses , and he is a cousin , my mother 's sister 's son . " " Are you human ? " Natasha asked , sitting down on a low cushion , since the skyship 's little cabin hardly had headroom . " Very much so , " Persephone assured her , sounding proud of the fact . " The Killer of Children has to be human . Who else would do it ? " " What does it mean to be the Killer of Children ? " This question had been hanging over her , unspoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Persephone suggested . " For now , it is enough that you are mine . You gave yourself to me , and you owe me your life . In return , I will have need of you . " " For what ? " Natasha whispered , not sure she wanted to know . Persephone studied her intently , weighing how much to tell , finally saying , " Nothing dishonorable nor deadly - I will do those things . Though it will certainly be difficult and dangerous . Life , as I said , is like that . " Taking out a stylus , Persephone made a few marks on a little strip of paper , then rolled the paper into a tiny tube . Opening the pigeon cage , she took out a bird , slipped the tube onto its leg , then released it out a window , watching the pigeon wing away . Natasha remembered the bird she released when she arrived at the shrine . One mystery was solved - she saw how the Killer of Children knew to come for her . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her look of drunken recognition , saying , " Do make yourself comfortable . Play with Eros if you like , but only when you are sober-being a demi-god he has no morals , and will happily get you pregnant . And please , please do not leap or fall overboard , at least until I am done with you . Any questions ? " Only a million or so , but she was too drunk to frame them . Looking about the neat little cabin , with its wicker floor and cushioned window seats , she asked , " Do all girls from the shrine come here ? " " No , " Persephone shook her blonde head , opened a potion ring and poured the white powder into a cup , then added amber liquid from a silver flask . " Each girl has her own story and goes her own way ; yours is to come here . " " Why make people think they will die ? " After what she had gone through , that seemed incredibly cruel . " To see I get the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closing the potion ring , then jiggling the cup to mix the powder with the liquid . " And many do die - the base of that cliff is littered with small bones . Your case does not seem nearly so hopeless . " Persephone handed her the cup , saying , " Here , drink this , it will put you to sleep . " Natasha took it and drank without a qualm , finding it was sweet fruit nectar . Persephone might surely poison her , but she doubted the Killer of Children would stoop to lying about it . In seconds she was sleeping soundly . When she first awoke , it was dark and she was lying on one of the window seats , with a curtain drawn between her and the rest of the cabin . Stars shone through the glass onto her , but there was no feel of movement . Incredible . And she was no longer drunk , not even hungover . Natasha burrowed deeper into the cushions and went back to sleep . Next time she awoke , daylight filled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , cut by shining loops of river . Cautiously sliding back the curtain , she saw breakfast laid out in the cabin , vinegared rice , smoked fish , and boiled pigeon eggs . After eating it all , she went out on deck , finding the skyship just as amazing sober as she did drunk . Persephone stood on the quarterdeck above the cabin , calling out orders to the crew forward , who worked the lines to the parasail . With the foot-pedaled maneuvering fans at quarter speed , Selene crabbed crosswind , running " heavy " and relying on aerodynamic lift to give direction . To Natasha it was all more magic . " Rested ? " Persephone called down from the quarterdeck . When Natasha nodded , the Killer of Children added , " Fed too , I hope , for I shall have need of you soon . " Somewhat alarming news . Natasha nodded again , trying to look ready . Relaxing at the port rail , she gloried in the feel of flight , watching green woodlands roll beneath the skyship 's keel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadows . Lazy loops of river curled and uncurled below , fanning out into silver marshland , full of weedy islands and bulrush channels . Wild ducks and herons rose up to greet them . Running along the river was a ribbon of road , the same one she and Sister Ida had traveled in their bedroom on wheels . " Landfall ahead , " shouted a sailor in the bow . Leaning far over the rail , searching for landmarks , Natasha saw a column of smoke rising over a big bend in the Brovva . At the base of the smoke stood Hebektahay Castle - the Bride of the D'Hays - Helena 's clan 's last stronghold on the Brovva , ringed by besieging D'Brovniks . It had taken days to wend their way from here to Karadyevachka Shrine by ox-house . Aided by the stiff north wind , Selene had covered the same distance in a day and a half . " Come up , " Persephone called to her , " we are going to land . " Joining Persephone on the quarterdeck , Natasha found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green leather jacket , standing with her pubic bone pressed hard against the forward quarterdeck rail , feet planted on either side of the keel , testing the balance of the skyship , feeling her way down . Persephone grinned at her , saying , " This is the fun part . " Eros shouted from the amidships rail , " Valkyries to starboard . " Looking to her right , Natasha saw dark-winged shapes spiraling downriver . " More likely vultures , " Persephone declared . " Hard to tell at this distance . " " There 's a difference ? " Eros called back , looking as pretty as the god for whom he was named . Either way , a battle loomed ahead . Natasha watched Eros arm himself ; brash , arrogant , though still in his teens , the demi-god wore a silver doublet with angel-wing sleeves over green hose , to which Eros added a back-and-breast , and an armored codpiece , just in case . His sallet helm and golden crossbow lay by the rail - even Love went armored into war . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Selene down , her only protection the green leather flying jacket . Nor Natasha , watching the sprawling triple-walled castle rush up toward them . Lines of tents stretched out from the base of the castle rock , covered by a blue haze of cook smoke , closing off the big river bend and bottling in the D'Hays . Closer to the castle rock she could see catapults , tall siege towers , and war kites flying above the fortress . Fireballs arched over the walls , and a large breach had been pounded in the castle 's outer bailey . Black flags flew from the besieger 's towers , showing the D'Brovniks would give no quarter . Eros called out , " All hands aft . Bring up the bow . " Crew hurried aft , raising the bow . The huge gas-filled skysail overhead tilted back , slowing Selene 's fall . Persephone told Eros , " Take the helm , " then strode over to her roc sitting on the midship 's perch . Picking up a grapple line and mounting her bird , Persephone called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people below . " Some few hundred D'Hays in the castle were indeed Natasha 's people - though she doubted she knew any personally , this being as close as Natasha had ever come to the Bride of the D'Hays . And those few D'Hays were surrounded by thousands of angry D'Brovniks that Natasha wanted no part of - still she obeyed , climbing up behind Persephone . They took off together , trailing the grapple line , diving for the middle ward of the castle . D'Brovnik ballistas on the packed earth platform hurled spears up to greet them , great barbed shafts that the roc artfully avoided , setting them down on the onion-domed roof of the Basilica of the Black Virgin in the castle 's middle ward . Natasha was inside the walls of Hebektahay Castle , the same doomed keep she had seen from the far side of the river a few days ago , and never thought to see again . Arrows fired from war kites thudded into the roof around her . Persephone sprang from the saddle , securing her grapple to the roof and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unwilling to face the careening skyship coming in to land . Losing headway , Selene slewed about into the wind , and the line went taut as the windlass worked . Eros ordered the ground lines dropped , and grapples and anchors went over the side , catching on the basilica roof . Selene had made landfall without so much as a thump . Mews boys swarmed down a line to see to the roc , carrying clip-fed Cathayan repeating crossbows slung across their backs . Giving Natasha the saddlebags to carry , Perserphone led her across the dark roof through a forest of carved stone spires to a small door at the base of one of the onion-domes . There Persephone paused to let her catch up , smiling encouragement . Everything Persephone did - be it piloting a skyship , or entering a doomed fortress - was done with a smile , and with an easy swaying grace that came from being at peace with her soul . Nuns met them in an upper gallery , arrayed behind their Mother Superior , an unveiled stern-faced old nun who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her holiness asked frostily , " Why have you come here ? " " Your castle is doomed , " Persephone replied , not wanting to give the D'Hays any false hope . " I have come for the children . " " This is our house , and these are our children , " declared the aged nun , her wrinkled lips pulled taut , defying a teenaged demi-goddess who could kill her with a touch . " You are not wanted here , with your poisoned weapons and pagan ways . " " Death is hardly ever welcomed , " Persephone agreed amiably , " but this is my house too - there was a shrine here to the Dark Maiden centuries before there was ever a basilica or castle . And these children are marked for death , which makes them mine . " Mother Superior stiffened , insisting , " These children are under our protection . " Between them lay the incredible chasm between Old Rite and Mother Church , between a girl who embraced death and a crone married to God . " Tosh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save yourselves . Have you not seen the black flags outside ? When the D'Brovniks come in , everyone not kept for rape or ransom will be put to death , even the little ones . Along with any nun who objects too loudly . " " We are a holy order , " the Mother Superior protested grimly . " That is our protection . " Persephone patted Natasha on the shoulder , " Here is the last D'Hay nun who resisted the D'Brovniks ; she got the choice of being stoned to death , or given to the Killer of Children . I could wait and deal with the D'Brovniks when you are dead - but children here are already dying . " " Why do you think that ? " Mother Superior did not deny it . Persephone smirked , " A bird told me . You know you can neither feed nor protect them - do I deal with you , or the D'Brovniks ? " Mother Superior sighed , saying , " With us . " What other choice was there ? Nuns led them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and children huddled amid rich hangings and tall stern icons . Families sheltering in the nave shrank back as the Killer of Children walked among them , a sign of the terror to come . Nor did Natasha inspire much confidence , as the defrocked nun at her side , seeing people cross themselves as she passed . Looking into their frightened faces , Natasha realized she was seeing the living dead . By now she knew the D'Brovniks rather well , and after the expense and loss of a siege they would show no mercy , at least not on the weak and helpless . Starvation , followed by a hideous massacre of the survivors pretty much summed up these people 's future . Already terror and hunger had taken its toll , and some faced death with bewildered indifference , others with cringing politeness . Persephone went patiently from child to child , giving out candied fruit and honey cakes from the saddle bag , which the starved children wolfed down . As she did , Persephone quietly told the mothers she would take any child offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children immediately . To the women and girls who were pregnant , the Killer of Children offered an abortion potion , so they would not be forced to bring more innocent victims into the charnel house that the Bride of the D'Hays had become . Some took it , some did not . By the time they had gone through the entire nave , family by family , Natasha felt numb , drained by the fearful doomed faces . Her own trip to be sacrificed was heaven compared to this , with warm morning baths , Sister Ida at night , plenty to eat , and presents along the way . Her most primal heartfelt reaction was the same as Persephone 's - at least get the children out , as many as they could . Bad as things were in the Basilica of the Black Virgin , things were far worse in the outer ward . Rather than risk her roc , Persephone went on foot , with Natasha right behind her , while Eros stood on the roof of the basilica , covering them with his golden crossbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle ward had watched Selene land , but were still shocked to see the Killer of Children walking casually among them , with her silver bow and deadly touch . An absolutely abysmal omen . Already people walked only on the landward side of the ward , since trebuchet balls lobbed over the walls came crashing down on the river side , where they had smashed several homes and a brewery into kindling . Whenever Persephone saw a child she produced a sweet , telling her tale about taking children to safety - just have Mother bring you to the basilica . No one made a move to stop her . Guards at the inner gate hastily ushered them through , lowering the drawbridge between the two baileys . Beyond the bridge , the outer ward was a shambles , breached and burned , overshadowed by the huge mountain of earth the D'Brovniks had erected to let their archers and catapults fire down into the bailey . Head-sized stones came crashing down , more or less at random , and D'Brovnik archers sniped at anyone who moved - being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better sort of townsfolk , who could not be just turned out of the castle like serfs . None of them seemed the better sort now , looking starved and scared , living in holes and basements . Fortunately , most had already had the sense to give their children to the nuns , getting them into the middle ward . But Persephone insisted on combing the smoking rubble in the outer ward , coming up with several orphans and an abandoned baby that Natasha carried . But her mind was on a skinny hollow-eyed boy who stubbornly insisted on staying with his dying mother . She gave him the last of her honey cakes . Back at the Basilica of the Black Virgin , Eros had started a baby-lift , off-loading rice and beans , while taking on talkative children , who asked , " Where are we going ? " " Does that big bird bite ? " " How come my mother can not come ? " " I am still hungry . " " Yes , let 's have more honey cakes . " " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered , " Home . Yes , keep away from her beak . Too old . There are berries and dates waiting in the cabin . Home , I told you . " Hearing the word " Home " again , Natasha asked , " Where are they going ? " " Somewhere safe . " Persephone sounded purposefully vague . " So long as you do not know exactly where , the most hideous torture can not wring it from you . " Cheering thought . Natasha wondered who Persephone 's parents were . Who could have mothered the Killer of Children ? Persephone must have family , aside from Eros , but all Natasha knew of Old Rite religion came from fairy stories and ghost tales . She always pictured the Killer of Children as a horrible hag with bloody teeth . Grinning broadly , the blonde young demi-goddess asked , " Ready for more ? " " More ? " Natasha thought she had misheard her mistress . " There is still the castle keep , and beyond the walls , " Persephone reminded her . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer ward , yet another round of carnage seemed too much . Persephane cocked an inquiring eyebrow . " Did you think it was fun being Killer of Children ? " " No , " Natasha had honestly never thought that . Nor had she ever wanted to hear these terrible stories and see people make gut-wrenching choices . " Whyever did you pick me for this ? " " Silly girl , " Persephone scoffed at the notion , " I never picked you . You chose me , remember ? Death makes do with whatever comes her way . " " Of course . " How could she be so foolish ? " I could have been tied to a stake and stoned to death instead , or thrown myself off that cliff . " " And what a wise choice this was . " Persephone gave Natasha 's hand a squeeze , kissing her on the forehead . " For which we are all very thankful . " " Really ? " Natasha felt fairly useless , carrying babies and handing out honey cakes to famished children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at you ? And the mews boys too . I had to keep a lock on the cabin . " Persephone rolled her eyes at all the trouble she had been put to , saying , " Buck up , girl , I will give you a treat . We will see to the castle keep next , saving the worst for last . " Something to look forward to . But she did feel better , knowing she had inadvertently chosen to do good . Should she die from a sniper 's arrow or a stray catapult ball , it would literally be " for the children . " Like she promised the folks in Nordling . And it was nice to be appreciated , even if for the wrong reasons . Following her mistress to where their roc stood waiting , she looked at the mews boys in a new light . Did they really think her cute ? One of them certainly was , standing by the roc , smiling broadly , his repeating crossbow held loosely at the end of a long brown arm . Mounting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Children and they took off , headed for the high stone heart of Hebektahay Castle , the towering keep overlooking the middle and outer wards . As soon as she alighted in the inner ward , Natasha was in another world , smelling bread baking , and seeing chicken and ducks underfoot . Pigs guzzled milk from the buttery that could have fed babies in the middle ward - but boyars did not eat babies . Liveried servants met them as they landed , a steward and butler greeted them , while a groom and pages attended to the roc , all well-fed and wearing the D'Hay shock-of-wheat badge . Persephone politely accepted the steward 's invitation to meet with the Castellan , then turned and knelt , ignoring the men and saying directly to the startled pages . " I assume you are fosterlings , and have no parents here - if so go straight to the Basilica of the Black Virgin . I am taking children out of here . " Before the shocked Steward could stop them , one of the boys asked , " Will we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stay here , " Persephone promised , then rose and followed the aghast retainers into the main hall to meet with the D'Hays . All the castle leaders were assembled to greet them , a sign of desperate times - normally a call from the Killer of Children was welcome as spotted pox . Men were in French hose and padded doublets , and sported fashionable velvet cap-hoods and ragged slashed sleeves , while unveiled women wore long Viennese gowns . D'Hays affected western ways , letting their women mix with men , not keeping them veiled and confined . Much to her surprise , Natasha recognized two of Helena 's relatives , including Helena 's young cousin Alexi , whom Natasha used to babysit . No wonder they had not given up Hebektahay ; the boy was the D'Hay male heir , since young Baron Valad D'Hay was unmarried . Alexi was worth a duke 's ransom if the D'Brovniks bothered to ransom him , and did not just hold onto the boy , hoping the barony would come to them if dashing young Baron Valad could be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lady Constance , merely a Tolstoy married into the family , making twelve-year-old Alexi the ranking noble present . Wearing royal blue trimmed in cloth-of-silver , he stood in sulky silence , with a familiar look of bored masculine condescension doubly alarming in one so young . Lady Constance D'Hay spoke for him , welcoming them to Hebektahay Castle in the name of her nephew , introducing herself and the Castellan , a blunt , swarthy professional soldier in half-armor . Begging Persephone 's help , Lady Constance claimed the D'Brovnik assault was an unprovoked breach of truce , aimed at seizing the heir . Cut off from reinforcement , and facing slow defeat through starvation , Lady D'Hay pleaded , " Will you take my young Lord Alexi to safety with his mother in Markov ? " " You want me to fly him to the capital ? " Persephone looked amused , patiently explaining she was not a semi-divine delivery service . " I will take him , but to do with as I see fit . " Lady Constance blanched at the notion of the D'Hay heir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " That is needlessly cruel . " " Cruel ? " Persephone looked quizzically back at Lady D'Hay , as if unacquainted with the concept . " Has m'lady seen the black flags outside ? To keep Lord Alexi out of D'Brovnik hands , you condemned every serf and servant in this castle to death . Merely giving him up to the D'Brovniks could save scores of children . " " Surely , you would not think of that ! " Lady D'Hay 's shock turned to horror . " Think of it ? I surely would . " Persephone sounded sorely tempted . " Doing it is a different thing - but the decision will be mine and his to make . Who knows ? I have seen children give themselves freely to save others from suffering . " " Blasphemous ! " Lady D'Hay spat back , finding the notion of the D'Hay heir giving himself up to save starving serfs insultingly obscene . Persephone smirked . " Still , it is his choice . " Stepping closer , the Killer of Children knelt before the surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords , and the Castellan looked to Lady D'Hay - but it was too late ; as soon as Persephone got within reach , Alexi 's life was in her hands . " I am taking children out of here , " she told the D'Hay heir . " You can come with me . I can not swear I will take you to your mother in Markov . But I will not lie , and I will listen to what you say , like I would any boy who offered himself to me . " Demi-goddess and D'Hay heir stared at each other . Lord Alexi said nothing , looking into that intent blonde face , standing close enough to smell the sandlewood soap on Persephone 's soft white skin , seeing a beautiful but deadly teenager not much older than he , who flew through the air and killed with a touch - but promised to treat him like any other boy . " If you do not believe me , ask Natasha , " Persephone suggested , nodding toward his former babysitter turned renegade nun . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is useful and much admired . " Natasha smiled to show it was true , but Alexi looked dubious . Lady D'Hay tartly told them , " He is not just " any " boy . " Persephone rose to go , saying , " A day may come when he wishes he was . " Leading Natasha from the hall , the Killer of Children went to the kitchens , where she told every turn-spit and baker 's boy what she had told Alexi , that she was taking children out of Hebektahay Castle , and they were free to come too . Some put down their work at once , following her through the barns and living quarters , where she told the same story to serving girls and stable boys . By the time they reached the inner wall walk , with its sweeping view of the three walled baileys , ringed by the river and the enemy lines , they had a dozen excited children trooping behind them , suddenly free of their chores , sounding happy , scared , and hopeful . Nor did Persephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big bird fly up to perch on the battlements , introducing her to the awestruck children then two by two she flew them down to the basilica roof in the ward below . Then the Killer of Children came back for Natasha , saying , " Now comes the worst part . " And it was . Dodging darts and fireballs flung at them by D'Brovniks , they flew down to the outer ward 's riverbank postern , the tiny gate wedged between the bailey walls and the river 's edge , where the Bride of the D'Hays dumped her refuse . Babies lay abandoned by the gate , and Persephone searched through them for signs of life , finding two she could save , and one so gone that the Killer of Children could only end his suffering . The others were already dead . Natasha took the two they could salvage , and went searching for children among the people huddled at the river 's edge , serfs and aged townsfolk , living on belt leather and boiled grass . D'Brovnik archers shot anyone attempting to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to feed them . Emptying the food from her saddle bag so Natasha could use it to carry the babies , Persephone found three emaciated children whose parents gladly gave them up . Back atop the Basilica of the Black Virgin , smiling nuns took the abandoned babies , vowing to beg milk from the lords in the keep . Eros had returned with Selene , and was taking on another load of noisy well-fed children , while off-loading sacks of millet from the skyship . Natasha sensed minute planning at work , and saw the urgent need for secrecy , for the first load of children could not have gone far . Somewhere close by , atop an unscalable rock , or on an island in the Brovva , was a secret shrine , stockpiled with food beforehand under the unsuspecting noses of the D'Brovniks . Now children were being swapped for food , with the Selene running full each way . More magical misdirection , since so long as the children simply disappeared , no D'Brovniks would come looking for them . To adults in the doomed citadel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by their weight in beans and sweet cakes - making some of the younger nuns and novices giddy with excitement . Fear and hopelessness faded . Even families that did not give up their children could at least feed them , having an option other than watching them die . Eros met them at the skyship 's ladder , saying , " Someone from the keep to see you . " Standing on the quarterdeck , between the pigeon coop and the ballast taps , still wearing royal blue-and-silver , was young Alexi D'Hay , looking very pleased with himself . Sunlight shone on the D'Hay shock of wheat , done in cloth-of-gold on his chest . He announced proudly , " I have come to offer myself . " Persephone smiled , " What did Lady D'Hay say ? " He replied loftily , " My aunt thinks I am having a geography lesson . " " Which you shall , " Eros assured him . " The best place to learn geography is a quarter-mile up . " " First let me speak with him . " Persephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which young D'Hay emerged looking more self-important than ever . Before leaving Selene , Persephone took Natasha too aside , whispering , " Watch Alexi for me , and keep him happy . We may dearly have need of him , but he must be handled delicately . " Natasha nodded , knowing that young Lord Alexi was all boy , and a boyar-to-be , nine parts ego , with a dash of devilment - only someone as loving and ruthless as Persephone could hope to control him . Best Natasha could do was to keep watch on him , making sure he did not climb the rigging lines or fall overboard . Eros dumped water ballast and took off , using the increased lift and foot-powered fans to maneuver the Selene upwind , back the way they had come . Alexi oohed excitedly , asking innumerable questions , without awaiting any answers , hanging dangerously far over the quarterdeck rail . Weary of fielding wild questions , Natasha asked one of her own , " Why did you come ? " Alexi had always been alarmingly willful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of her ! " Alexi 's eyes lit up at the thought of Persephone . " She is amazing , is she not ? " Clearly Alexi was in love . Small wonder . Persephone was smashingly beautiful and utterly fearless , and being a boy , young Lord D'Hay was not the least turned off by her bow and poison arrows . " And you , too , Natasha , " Alexi assured her he had not forgotten his former babysitter . " You were always so nice , and let me do what I wanted . I trust you , much more than Aunt Constance , who is shrill and overbearing , and got us into this terrible mess . If you trust Persephone , so do I. " Natasha thanked him , hoping love and trust did not get Alexi killed . Until now Natasha had been doing good , taking children out of a ghastly situation . But Alexi 's situation had been anything but ghastly , living in luxury , with both sides wanting him alive and well - just under their control . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's example , so whatever happened to him was in some sense her doing . She thought the hiding place might be an island in the Brovva , or an unassailable rock , but it turned out to be both . Not far upstream a tall flat rock outcropping rose right out of the river , dividing the Brovva into a pair of white cataracts , making it nearly impossible to get to the rock by land or water . From above Natasha could see the hidden shrine , nestled in a low hollow atop the plateau , several small buildings surrounded by a drystone wall - already overrun with children . Releasing gas from the parasail , Eros glided down to a landing before the shrine , dropping grapples to a female ground crew . Children helped reel them down to a jubilant reunion , their enthusiasm turning the rescue operation into an impromptu party . Games got going full tilt , while adults piled food aboard the skyship to replace newly arrived kids . Ground crew comforted the more traumatized kids , who missed their mothers or demanded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upriver accents showed the adults came from Nordling , or even farther north , and in normal times the secret shrine must have been nearly deserted . By now Natasha knew from hints and clues that Persephone and Eros came from far beyond Nordling , from the frigid white land of death , where winters were black hell and the summer Sun shone at midnight . Persephone slept under a white bearskin coverlet , and Eros wore arctic fox trim on his doublet . Older children reveled in their newfound freedom from fear , death , and parental discipline . Here there was no war , no hunger , no chores , no lessons , just an incredible high-flying holiday . So long as they did not hurt each other , or fall off the rock , anything was allowed . Natasha watched as Alexi took charge of the boys , selecting the games and assigning roles , which the others gladly accepted , happy to have a lordling leading them . Natasha knew from long experience that boys would put up with anything , so long as the pecking order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Natasha attended her in the aft cabin , where the Killer of Children asked how things went with Alexi . " Well enough , " Natasha confessed - then added hesitantly , " Do you know Alexi is in love with you ? " " Yes , shamelessly so , " Persephone smiled proudly , " much to Lady Constance 's dismay . " Lady D'Hay had to be having fits at the moment , facing thousands of angry D'Brovniks without her lordly nephew and chief bargaining chip . Now Lady Constance was just another titled female in a doomed fortress , whose best hope was to disappear into a nunnery , or more likely a D'Brovnik haram . Persephone laughed . " I know boys far better than Lady D'Hay . Boys are half my business . " Natasha nodded , betting they were the harder half . " So he will do whatever you want ? " " Apparently , " Persephone replied . " Which is why we must be careful , for love is a terrible thing to abuse . And Alexi is a child under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she . How unfair that Alexi rated such attention , just for being an obstinate boy and a boyar . His feelings were catered to , and he got long personal meetings with Persephone , and lorded over the other children-while she dodged catapult darts and cared for starving babies . Reading her mind , Persephone told her , " Do not be jealous . You have done wonderfully , bearing up better than I could ever have imagined . When we are done here at Hebektahay , you have more than discharged your debt to me . " " But I want to be with you , " Natasha blurted out - she wanted Persephone 's admiration , not Alexi 's , nor some mews boy 's . At the moment , she could not imagine life without Persephone , dirty starving babies and all . " I gave myself to you . " Persephone smiled , taking Natasha 's face in hands , and looking straight into her eyes , saying , " So you did , and for a good reason . Though what that reason is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased and happy that you chose me . " The Killer of Children kissed her , then added , " Flattered even . " " My other choice was being stoned to death , " Natasha reminded her . " Sometimes fate needs a helping hand , " Persephone explained airily . " Still , you chose me sight unseen . Are you disappointed ? " " Not at all . " Natasha reveled in the touch and eye-contact , in having this magical person to herself , even though the venom rings felt chill against her cheeks . " Come , fly back to Hebektahay with me , " Persephone suggested . " Young Lord D'Hay will be fine with Eros until we get back . Cousin Eros is but an overgrown boy himself . " Natasha climbed onto the roc 's saddle , thrilled by hearing " we " from the Killer of Children . As they flew back to Hebektahay , she thought of Helena , wishing her friend had been given this choice , a chance to do something decent instead of dying a miserable death at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . Winging along , her arms about Persephone 's waist , Natasha missed Helena grievously , but she knew people around her were losing everything , forced to give up even their children . Her best way to mourn Helena was to save others from her fate . Hebektahay Castle appeared ahead , and the roc crossed high over the D'Brovnik lines , then spiraled down toward the middle ward . Having seen her do this before , D'Brovniks had hauled a powerful ballista , a giant crossbow on wheels , to the top of the earth ramp overlooking the outer ward , siting it carefully for a single shot . Natasha did not see the ballista fire , so the long steel dart seemed to come out of nowhere , hitting the roc beneath the right wing and shooting through the raptor 's breast . Piercing the saddle as well , the steel shaft ripped through Natasha 's skirt , cut a long gash in her thigh , and shot upward , hitting Persephone in the back of the head . Blood splashed over Natasha 's face , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hung onto Persephone 's limp form , feeling the roc buckle beneath them . They were going down , and there was nothing Natasha could do . Falling into a flapping spin , the dying roc whirled earthward , while Natasha held tight to the limp Persephone , keeping the Killer of Children in the saddle . Legs locked in the saddle straps , Natasha clung grimly to her mistress , praying to the Virgin as the world spun around her , not letting go of Persephone until they slammed into the ground . Gilded Cage nATASHA AWOKE in a dark moving box , with a horrible headache and a stabbing pain in her leg . Without opening her eyes , Natasha knew she was back in the little traveling house that had taken her and Sister Ida from Brovazamak to the Shrine of the Dark Maiden at Karadyevachka . She could feel the sway of the wagon and Sister Ida 's warm still body beside her . It seemed strange to be back in that little house , for so much had happened since she left it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at best a blurry dream , full of blatantly impossible images , from blonde bold Persephone seated on her roc , to the hell of Hebektahay Castle . Totally unbelievable , though her hurting and banged brain insisted it was all true . Sister Ida 's long warm leg lay across Natasha 's bared hip , feeling familiar and comforting - but Natasha was vaguely nauseated , her leg hurt , and she was not at all in an amorous mood . Cautiously , so as not to bump her hurt leg , nor rouse the sleeping nun , she slid out from under Sister Ida , propped herself up , and opened her eyes . Only her eyes did not open . No matter how hard Natasha tried , she could not raise her lids . Weird , and scary . Panicking , she put her hands to her face , finding her eyes glued shut , caked with something splashed on her face . Wetting her fingers , she frantically unglued her lids , tasting blood . Her eyes struggled open , and Natasha saw it was not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling house at all . She was lying on ratty cushions in a moving wooden box , rolling along a rutted road , with daylight filtering through cracks in the warped wood . Her dress had been slit to the hip , and her thigh was bandaged where it hurt . Flies buzzed about the warm closed wooden interior . Instead of Sister Ida , it was Persephone lying next to her , face down and naked , the back of her blonde head a mass of dried blood , drawing flies . Everything came back to Natasha in a hideous instant : the flight back to Hebektahay , the shaft hitting them , the whirling fall - and now here . What covered her face and glued her lids was Persephone 's blood . Gagging at the thought , Natasha threw up onto the straw-covered floor , just managing to miss the stained cushions . Devastated , Natasha leaned her head against the box , wiping her mouth with her arm , trying hard not to cry . D'Brovniks had her . If she had fallen within the walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven Persephone was alive . Her hand rested on the Killer of Children 's bare rib cage , drawing strength from the deep steady breathing . So long as Persephone was with her , Natasha had hope ; though at the moment , things felt awfully bleak . No doubt she was headed back to Brovazamak , unless perchance there was someplace worse , but aside from her ghastly headache , and the wound in her thigh , she had survived the fall admirably . No broken bones , no sprained limbs - the roc must have cushioned her fall . Persephone was the one hurting . Determined not to fail Persephone the way she failed Helena , Natasha looked about , seeing a water bucket in one corner , which turned out to be half full . Taking a drink first , she washed her face , careful to keep the water clean for Persephone . Then she dragged the bucket over to the Killer of Children , and washed the wound at the back of her head , wiping off clotted blood , biting away hanks of hair with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not down to the bone . Cleaning it as best she could , Natasha finally did cry , softly while she worked , tears falling on her hands , on Persephone 's fine blonde hair , and into the wound itself , helping to wash it . When she had the wound clear , she used needle and thread from her apron to close it - not perfect , but not likely to fester either . Heaven knew what was going on inside Persephone 's head ; she had not stirred , even while Natasha was sewing the wound closed . Worrisome , but only if she did not wake up . For now , Persephone was getting some dearly needed sleep . Having seen to her mistress , Natasha examined her own wound , finding a clean gash , already scabbed over , painful but starting to heal . She mentally thanked the unknown woman who so diligently cleaned and dressed her wound . Putting her eye to a crack , Natasha saw the Brovva shining between the trees , showing they were indeed headed south . How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt her head to try to remember . Settling down , she went back to sleep herself . Persephone slept through that day and the next , thoroughly frightening Natasha . Each day the guards lowered food and water through a trap , while her toilet was a hole in the floor . Each day she washed Persephone 's wound , asking for hot boiled water , and actually getting some . On the third morning , Persephone 's eyes flipped open , taking a puzzled look around , then her lips moved , asking , " Am I dreaming ? " " No , " Natasha told her , relieved to see the Killer of Children awake , but Persephone had already fallen back to sleep , her soft young face looking totally at peace . Later that day , the blue eyes opened again , and Persephone asked , " Where am I ? " " We are prisoners in a wagon box , " Natasha explained excitedly , glad to have her mistress awake again , sounding far happier than the news warranted . " Being hauled south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " Persephone seemed completely puzzled by her surroundings . Slowly Natasha coaxed the memories out of her , starting with their success at Hebektahay Castle , getting out boatloads of children , including Alexi D'Hay himself . " We did ? " Persephone was impressed . " Alexi too ? " " He 's in love with you , " Natasha reminded her , nor was Alexi the only one . " Another conquest . " Persephone winced , examining the wound on the back of her head with her fingertips . " Why can I not do so well with grown men ? Something about me makes men wary . Was that who gave me this ? Some man with a grudge - most likely one I never met ? " Too true . Boys might like the arrows and attitude , but men saw Persephone as a menace . Their loss so far as Natasha was concerned , but she did not say so . Persephone had forgotten all about their kiss before boarding the roc , and her vow to take time for Natasha . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise sounded pretty silly - since they faced days together . Natasha settled for a safe summary , telling how they left Alexi with Eros , and then were shot down returning to Hebektahay Castle , landing them here . " Amazing , " Persephone declared , still tenderly examining her wound , " and I do remember some of it . Who cleaned and sewed up my head ? " " That would be me , " Natasha admitted , wishing she had done a better job of stitching . " Thank you immensely . " Persephone pulled Natasha closer and kissed her tenderly . " You are smart and brave , and have aided me incredibly . I am sorry I have gotten you into this horrible place . I am sure I meant well , and must have had some plan ready if things went wrong . Only now I can not remember what it was .... " Natasha said nothing , still recovering from being pressed to Persephone 's naked breast and kissed so lovingly . Persephone liked her - a lot . Bad as things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach . She had so wanted to be included in Persephone 's world , and now their world had shrunk to this wooden box , until the D'Brovniks let them out . Despite the dim light she could see every curve in the Killer of Children 's slim blonde body . Persephone had a strange way of holding herself , bold and forward without seeming seductive - but not like a man either . More like a hawk . Now that Natasha had studied the Killer of Children in detail , she saw why ; the demi-goddess had a body trained since girlhood to be strong and graceful , a body Persephone completely trusted , neither needing to be hidden , nor displayed . Wanting to know everything , Natasha decided to start at the beginning . " Who is your mother ? What is she like ? " " Mother ? My mother ? " Persephone got up ; still holding the back of her head , carefully examining the box they were in . " She is a most sainted woman , meek as a mouse , lives on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me . Hard to think we are even related .... " " And your father ? " asked Natasha , following Persephone 's every movement . " Never met the man myself , " Persephone admitted , " but Mother thought the world of him .... " While Persephone prowled about testing the box , working life back into her limbs , Natasha kept asking questions , learning that the Killer of Children was born in a far-off northern castle where the Inner Sound ran into the white frozen Arctic Sea . Her sainted mother was Goddess-on-Earth , and lived in a sanctuary called Fair Isle , where they ate fruit and grains , and no one died except by natural causes . With Mother living the contemplative life , the family was led by Persephone 's older sister , Lady Kore , the Dark Daughter , demi-goddess of Death . Kore had seen to her training , and someday Persephone would succeed her sister as Lady Death and Dark Daughter . " To start me out easy , Kore and Mother made me the Killer of Children . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though I actually think Eros suggested it . " " Eros ? Really ? " Natasha had no idea how this weird family worked . " So he could get me alone . " Persephone smiled at Natasha 's surprise . " Eros is all male . And since Kore got a Sea Beggar boyfriend , Eros has turned his charm on me . He hopes to get one of us with child , so he may have an heir in the family . " Jolting to a halt , the moving box opened and light flooded in through the trap above . Seeing Persephone up and awake , guards became wary , making a young servant lower the food and water while they pointed bows and spears at that trap , treating the Killer of Children like a scorpion in a bottle . And rightly so , since whoever took her bow and clothes had not dared touch her venom rings . Blinking in the bright sunlight , Natasha looked back up at the men 's faces , seeing bearded D'Brovniks in armor , and a nervous young servant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dinner was biscuits , hard cheese , and cold bacon , washed down with Brovva water . As they ate , Natasha asked cautiously , " Do you have much experience with men ? " Persephone laughed . " Only if you count cousin Eros . " " You slept with Eros ? " " Slept ? " Persephone looked puzzled , saying , " Not that I recall , but he did show me several ingenious ways to bring a man to orgasm - the sort of instruction Mother was never any good at . " Persephone nodded toward the closed trap . " You saw how it is . I keep my eyes open , but it is hard to meet the right sort of man - though the boy who lowered the water bucket was cute . Did you see how he leaned down to have a closer look ? Of course when I smiled back at him , he nearly dropped the bucket . But being Lady Death 's little sister has this one great advantage - any man who lays hands on me must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ? " Natasha asked cautiously . " Do you like women ? " " Absolutely , " Persephone declared , chewing on a bit of cheese , " we are a most marvelous sex . I thank the Mother every morning that I was not born a man . " Natasha saw she was being teased . " I mean women as lovers . " " Women or girls ? " Persephone arched an inquiring eyebrow , then smiled , reaching out to Natasha , saying , " Come over here . " Natasha did , and the Killer of Children put an arm around her , saying , " You are mine . You gave yourself to me . So like Alexi , you are a child in my care anything else would not be proper between us . " Natasha understood , though it seemed unfair that a pagan demi-goddess should have more scruples toward her charges than Sister Ida , who was married to God . To take away some of the disappointment , Persephone kissed her again . " Just because I am the Killer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you a lot , and we work well together - despite all current evidence to the contrary . " Persephone nodded to indicate the box they were in , not sounding the least worried by it . " You chose me for a reason , " Persephone reminded her , " though we do not know what it is yet . And you will not always be a child under my care - time is the true killer of children . " Natasha admitted she had never been with a man , and though in some ways she ached for it , the prospect made her uneasy . Except for the guards leading her to sacrifice , men had been either indifferent or mean to her . " It scares me some . " " Do not worry , it is easier than it sounds . " Persephone assured her , giving her shoulders a squeeze . " One day the right man will just be there . And when he finds out you were once a nun , there will be no stopping him . Nothing moves a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to God . " " But why ? " She thought of Sister Ida , who seemed perfectly happy seeing men only through a veil . " Because that is where children come from , " Persephone reminded her . " Besides , it is fun . You will see . " Easy for her to say . Even naked and in a box , the Killer of Children terrified the D'Brovniks , who never opened the trap except to feed them . They had to see the world through cracks in the wood , or by looking down the toilet hole . After studying the roadway passing below , Persephone announced that the siege of Hebektahay had been lifted . Marvelous news if true . Natasha thought of all those doomed people , asking , " How do you know ? " " Horse droppings , " Persephone explained happily , still staring down the toilet hole , " the whole road is covered with them , showing masses of cavalry moving ahead of us . And infantry too , mashing the older droppings flat , all headed south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and going home - there is no other army hereabouts . They must have heard we have Alexi . " " And they have us , " Natasha reminded her high-flying mistress . " For the moment , " Persephone admitted . Just how much the Killer of Children frightened her captors was clear when they got to Brovazamak . Arriving at early noontide , they were hauled by hand through the town streets to the palace citadel . Natasha heard children shout and dogs bark , and the hollow rumble of one drawbridge , then another . Finally gates closed behind them , then came silence , no scrape of boots , no men 's voices , nothing . When the wagon rear came banging down , Natasha saw why . Nuns were waiting , fully veiled , in a big windowless room lit only by lamplight . Despite all their arms and armor , not a single D'Brovnik was brave enough to open the box , letting wives of God do it instead . Natasha scrambled out , saying to Persephone , " We are in the haram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon to stand beside her , staring at the tall tapestried chamber , whose rafters were carved with cherubs edged in gold . " At least it is pretty . What part ? Have you been here before ? " " No , " Natasha told her , " which makes me think we are in the Gilded Cage . " " What is the Gilded Cage ? " Persephone looked curiously about , clearly new to haram life . " Deep inside the D'Brovnik haram there is a windowless walled-off section that no one ever sees , " Natasha explained , " surrounding a barred court , called the Gilded Cage - used to hold women and children who need to be kept alive , but can not be let out . Spare heiresses . Insane heirs . Children of executed enemies . Rich and difficult former wives . Some stay in the Gilded Cage their whole lives , or until menopause makes them safe to release . Or just until they are old enough to publicly execute . Outsiders only see the plush entrance chamber , a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pretty cherubs , " Persephone agreed , following the silent nuns through the gold doorway , entering the Gilded Cage . Natasha found herself in the smallest , fanciest nunnery she had ever seen , complete with kitchens , bakery , hen coops , milk cows , and a brewery , all indoors - its windowless walls decorated with gold leaf designs . Nuns gave them gray silk robes to wear , and bowls of rice and curried chicken , telling them to take their food into the garden . Which they did . Noon sunlight fell through steel bars covered in gold , splashing onto a fountained court . Colonnades ran around the first two stories , letting air and light into the apartments , but the third story was blank white stone , all the way up to the gilt bars . Women did their washing in the fountain , and children played nearby , several happy toddlers , two grave-eyed girls with brown hair , and a sickly looking older boy . One of the girls solemnly came over , saying , " You are new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children agreed . " I am Persephone , and this is Natasha . Who are you ? " " Lady Sofia Turgorov , " the girl replied gravely , then indicated her younger sister , saying , " This is Lady Maria . " Natasha recognized the Turgorov heiresses , not seen since the smaller one 's birth . How weird it must be to grow up under a barred sky , with this court and apartments as your whole world , never seeing anything that did not come through the Gold Door . D'Brovniks meant for grown men to remain a total mystery to these two girls , since so long as the sisters were childless the vast Turgorov estates remained in D'Brovnik hands . Happy to have two new souls in their world , Lady Sofia and Lady Maria introduced the other children , including Baron D'Brovnik 's own niece , and a sickly boy who should have been Lord D'Loy - slated to be strangled if he showed any signs of reaching puberty . Nuns took their dishes , inviting them to use the bathhouse built into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from the upstairs boiler and rooftop cistern . Hearing an upriver accent , Natasha asked the nun , " Do you know Sister Ida from Nordling ? " Seeing the nun nod swiftly , Natasha begged her , " Please tell Sister Ida that Novice Natasha from Karadyevachka is in the Gilded Cage . Sister Ida will very much want to know . " No nun could mistake her meaning . Entering steamy perfumed darkness , dimly lit by sunlight coming through slits in the stone , Natasha stripped before a hot foamy cascade , sponging away the sweat and grime of travel , carefully cleaning the pink flesh growing around her scab . When she started to ask what they should do next , Persephone shushed her , saying , " Talk about something light . Like men . " From the way Persephone rolled her eyes , Natasha knew they were being overheard . Deciding to give any listening nuns an earful , she said the first frivolous thing that entered her head . " Do the mews boys really like me ? " " Well , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steaming circular pool in the center of the bathhouse . Sliding into the warm clean water , Natasha felt tension dissolve , and knots loosen at the back of her neck . " Which one ? " she asked . " The cute one ? " Shaking her head , Persephone replied sadly , " Sorry , he is gay . " That did not sound so bad . " Too carefree and frivolous ? " Persephone laughed again . " No , a sodomite . " " Too bad . " Natasha lay on her back , staring at the dark stone ceiling , wondering who might be listening . Upstairs was the boiler and sauna , and below them the heating pipes and drains . From near the nuns " entrance came the hollow click of something being set down on the stone . " I have always thought so , " Persephone agreed , paddling about the pool . " Unless you are a boy . " Looking up , Natasha saw a bowl of sherbet sitting by the nuns " entrance , beside a single spoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanking the sisters , Natasha got out of the pool to fetch it , warm threads of water falling from her nude form . As she knelt to pick up the bowl , a pair of brawny eunuchs in loincloths stepped through the entrance , seized her arms , and pinned them behind her . Shocked and scared , she opened her mouth to yell , but a third eunuch looped a bowstring about her neck , pulling it tight , cutting off her startled cry . Her kicking stopped , and though she could not move , she saw with crystal clarity , taking in every horrific detail as it happened . Kazak archers descended the stairs from the sauna above , bows bent , arrows pointed at Persephone . D'Brovnik men-at-arms wearing mail and holding swords stepped out of the nuns " entrance . Helpless , unable to move or speak , struggling just to breathe , Natasha saw the scene recede into some weird waking nightmare , fading around the edges . Moments ago , she had been warm and happy , already tasting the sherbet . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persephone wade toward her from far away , ignoring the Kazak bows . Bows did not frighten Persephone . To be Killer of Children meant she accepted her own death - anytime and anyplace - always ready to lay down her life for her charges . If she feared death , how could Persephone perform abortions , or kill a deformed baby ? Stepping out of the nuns " entrance , a man-at-arms foolishly came between them at the pool 's edge , thinking a wet naked woman was no match for a swordsman in mail . Smiling grimly , Persephone lashed out with her left hand , grabbing the wrist of his sword arm , venomed fingers finding the patch of bare flesh between his leather glove and mail sleeve . Face white , the warrior went limp , dropping his sword and pitching forward . Grabbing him by his steel collar , Persephone kept the paralyzed man-at-arms from falling into the pool , at the same time shielding herself from the archers , saying cheerfully in Kazak , " Hold your fire , brothers . Shoot me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nuns " entrance , wearing full armor and flanked by torchbearers , saying , " Stop ! Come any closer , and we will kill her . " Natasha felt the bowstring tighten as the tension mounted , cutting off her air completely . Persephone stood at the edge of the pool , still holding up the hapless man-at-arms , saying , " She has given herself to me , and lies under my protection . " " And no harm will come to her , " Baron D'Brovnik hastened to agree . " She shall be returned intact when we have completed our pressing business .... " Natasha blacked out . First her vision went , but she could still hear far-off voices in the dark , though she had no interest in what they said . All Natasha 's consciousness was on the bowstring about her neck , hurting like fire and tearing at her throat , making her head seem to explode in blackness . WHEN SHE AWOKE , Natasha lay wrapped in silk sheets scented with musk , in an ornate bed with the cloth-of-gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floored by thick Persian carpets and walled with warm Polish tapestries . Had her neck not still hurt , she would have thought herself in Heaven . Ghastly memories crowded in , full of helpless horror , of how it felt to strangle in strong remorseless hands attached to brawny arms and blank faces . As they throttled her , the eunuchs had looked only at Baron D'Brovnik , reading his lips . Somehow she had survived the three mutes of the bowstring , implacable haram executioners who could not be bribed , swayed , nor threatened . How many women could say that ? Too few for sure . Waiting on the bed table was a crystal pitcher of water , salve for her throat , herb tea , and a stoppered bottle of peach brandy , along with sugar wafers and several lemons . On the gold bed lay a lady 's chemise and a long-sleeved crimson gown , trimmed with gold-embroidered flowers . Someone was seeing to her every need , and more . Outstanding . That meant Persephone was alive ; otherwise the D'Brovniks would have disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell , awaiting slow dismemberment , not lodged in plush apartments , rubbing salve on her raw throat . This could only mean they cared for the Killer of Children 's good opinion . Her last blurry image had been of Persephone , defiant and unhurt , shielding her bare body with a man-at-arms . Hopefully her mistress was still unharmed and unbroken . Natasha spiked her herb tea with peach brandy and set out to explore the premises , hoping Persephone was asleep in the next room ; finding three rooms , with a private bath and flush toilet , all windowless except for white arabesque screens opening onto air shafts and the inner court , and all leading to a single locked door - with no Persephone . Her only companions were a half-dozen songbirds in a silver cage . But by pressing her ear against the bedroom screen she could hear children playing . Nuns fed her twice daily , sliding china bowls and silver filigree trays through a slot in her single door . Plush as it was , it was still a prison , walled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was there , trying to chat up the nun on the other side , keeping it light , never asking for anything the nun could not readily give . Begging fennel for her tea , but not asking to pass notes to Persephone . On the third morning her constant efforts to make friends met with success , as the lock turned and the painted door opened . In came the nun , carrying Natasha 's breakfast tray , setting it silently on the floor between them - though this was strictly forbidden . Closing and locking the door , the nun lifted her veil to reveal tears of happiness . It was Sister Ida . Before she could recover , Sister Ida had kissed her , saying tearfully , " How wonderful to see you ! I prayed for you every day , never thinking to see you again . " No one ever said that to Natasha before ; a bit taken aback by this godsend , she stammered , " How did you get here ? " " One of the regular nuns has a lover outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Right now the owner of this habit is locked in naked embrace , or she is very much wasting her time outside . " That last was plainly Sister Ida 's idea of what they ought to be doing . Realizing this was an opportunity that might never come again , she told Sister Ida , " Take off your habit and veil . " Natasha did not have to ask twice . Slipping out of her habit , Sister Ida started on the shift underneath , but Natasha stayed her hand . " Wait here for me . I must use the habit and veil . No one will know it is not you . " " Wait , " Sister Ida protested , " what are you doing ? " Natasha stopped Sister Ida with a kiss , sliding the habit and veil out of the nun 's hands . Who could Sister Ida complain to ? The nun from Nordling was in the Gilded Cage illegally , to see a novice she had seduced in violation of both their vows . Would they punish her any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , Natasha put on the habit and veil , then opened the door and picked up the breakfast tray , saying , " There is peach brandy by the bed , and I will be back as quick as I can to drink it with you . " For the first time since Helena died , she was seeing the world through a veil , a shadowy softening of sight and sound , turning life into a gray whisper . Holding the tray before her , she glided down a short corridor , stopped to check the apartment next to hers - found it empty . Children were playing in the central courtyard . Her apartment occupied one corner of the Gilded Cage , and the baths occupied another , which left two more corners where the apartments did not front on the courtyard , and could hold secret prisoners . Four apartments at least , maybe more . And who knew what they would contain ? Trying to better her odds , she strolled purposefully up to the children , pausing before Lady Maria , and saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days ago . Which apartment is hers ? " Lady Maria did not answer , and her older sister was not there to ask . Lady Sofia , whose name meant wisdom , would have known . One of the boys shouted out , " There is a blonde in the south tower . " Another boy agreed . " Ground floor . " Persephone was the sort of woman boys noticed . Natasha set out for the south corner , her silver breakfast tray in front of her , feeling almost invisible in her veil . There were things she missed about being a nun , wafting about in a world of women , able to see men but never having them see you - a secure , secret world of service and silent anonymity , where love of anyone but God was outlawed . Far better ordered than the world outside , but mind-numbingly boring , especially compared to life with the Killer of Children . Finding the ground floor apartment , she nervously tried keys until one turned ; she prayed Persephone was on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door . First floor rooms were empty , and the apartment was an exact twin of hers - but with royal blue trim - so she knew immediately how to find the bedroom , mounting white marble stairs edged with lapis , lit by light falling through intricate alabaster screens . Stairs opened onto a sky blue chamber with a canopy bed , and Natasha saw a mass of blonde hair on the powder blue coverlet , as a familiar voice called out , " More food ? Wonderful . I am famished . Feels like I am eating for twelve . Set it down here . " Natasha nearly dropped the tray , stopped and stared in disbelief , suddenly knowing how Sister Ida felt on hearing she had come back from the Shrine of the Dark Maiden . Propped up on velvet bed cushions with the powder blue coverlet around her was blonde , freckle-faced Helena , pleading , " Pour me a tiny glass of tea , would you ? With sugar ? It is so hard to do it from here . " Helena sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hoping to be waited on - just like always . Tears streaming down her cheeks , Natasha just managed to set down the tray before whipping off her veil and leaping onto the bed , giving the startled Helena a tremendous hug , saying , " Thank heavens you are alive ! " " Natasha ? " Helena had asked for some tea and gotten tackled instead . " Is it you ? " " Of course it is me . " Helena was the miracle here , and Natasha covered her with kisses . " But how ? " Helena asked , returning the kisses , as happily amazed as Natasha . " I was told you were sacrificed , thrown as a virgin offering into Burning Mountain in the Iron Wood ? " " Much exaggerated , " Natasha explained . " I was given to the Killer of Children at Karadyevachka . " " Sounds ghastly enough . " Helena shuddered , pulling the coverlet tighter , naked beneath the bedclothes . " Now get me that tea , will you ? " Natasha poured Helena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " Sounds ghastly , but actually it has been unbelievably grand . " Handing Helena her tea , she asked , " How are you alive ? " Taking the tea glass , Helena patted her belly , saying , " Pregnant , very happily with child . Thanks to my loving late-husband 's last act of rape , I can not be executed for another seven months or more . " Helena not just alive , but pregnant ? Incredible . First a lady and heiress , then a baroness and murderess , now a mother-to-be , Helena kept on growing up at breakneck speed . Giving her friend a tremendous hug , Natasha told her how happy she had made her . Helena smiled coyly , " By being alive , or being with child ? " " Both , " Natasha declared , kissing Helena long and hard , thrilling to the wet familiar taste of her friend 's mouth . And not just Helena , she was tasting the baby too . After being horribly alone , now suddenly there were three of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she let go , Helena looked up at her , surprised by the intensity of the kiss , not used to Natasha saying how and when , much less what to do . Studying her friend intently , Helena asked , " What has happened to you ? " " I have given myself to the Killer of Children , " Natasha explained . For the first time ever they were equals , not because Natasha had risen any , but because the proud D'Hays had been humbled . They were no longer heiress and playmate , young lady and serving maid , nor baroness and confessor - but two condemned criminals in the Gilded Cage . " You will too . It is the most wonderful thing imaginable . " " So it seems . " Helena had little choice , needing Natasha as never before . " Is that where you got the bruises on your neck ? " " No , that happened here . " The mutes of the bowstring had left their mark on her neck . Natasha slid off the bed and picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartments until she found Persephone . For the first time ever she was leader , the prisoner with the keys and the plan - not to mention a devoted nun waiting for her in another corner apartment . While Helena lay naked and abed , idly awaiting post-partum execution . " We must start by finding Persephone . " " Finding who ? " Helena threw off her coverlet and strode naked to her wardrobe to pick through her gowns . Seeing Helena in the nude nearly undid Natasha ; one thing that had not changed was her love , and Helena well knew how to use it , flaunting white haram curves that pregnancy only made prettier , more full of life and purpose . " Persephone , " Natasha told her , remembering her own purpose . Much as she loved Helena , her mistress had gotten them into this mess , and it was up to Natasha to get them out . " You will see . " Helena grabbed a blue silk robe edged in cloth-of-silver , and caught Natasha at the door to the neighboring apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But with Helena in tow , Natasha had to be wary about crossing the courtyard . Washing was underway , and nuns were busy weeding , leaving nothing to do but brazen it out , striding purposefully down the colonnade toward the east corner apartments . No one even looked up until Helena came flouncing out in her blue silk robe , happily seeing the sun for the first time in weeks . Nuns dropped their tasks , startled to see a secret prisoner on the loose , while children returned Helena 's happy waves . Natasha ignored them , going to the ground floor apartment and turning the key in the door , praying for Persephone to be there . And Persephone was , wearing haram pants and a pretty gold embroidered jacket , with green leaves twining over the trim and sleeves , coolly waiting to see what nun would boldly come through her locked door . Natasha doffed her veil , and Persephone smiled , asking , " How is your neck ? " " Still hurting . " But her heart was happy , seeing Persephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw the demi-goddess , so cold and dangerous aboard her bird of prey . Never did Natasha think she would be so happy to see the Killer of Children . Helena slid in behind her , closing the door in the nuns " veiled faces . Persephone 's grin widened , acknowledging the newcomer . " And you would have to be Helena D'Hay . " Happy to have her fame precede her , Helena did a deft curtsy to the demi-goddess . " How did you know ? " " You are wearing D'Hay blue and silver , " Persephone told her , " topped by grain-gold hair . Are you with child as well ? " Helena confessed she was , adding that she thought it hardly showed . Persephone laughed . " Babies are my business . When Natasha told me your story it was my duty to think , but what if she is pregnant ? Would the D'Brovniks kill her before getting hold of the baby ? Not likely . " Helena was living proof Persephone reasoned right . Giving Natasha a told-you-so smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not jump off that cliff ? " " What cliff ? " asked Helena , not liking to be left out . " Tell you later . " Natasha had forgotten her first impulse on seeing Persephone had been suicide . Determined to change the subject , she asked , " What happened with Baron D'Brovnik in the bath house ? " " You had a bath with the baron ? " Helena looked appalled at the notion of Persephone sharing a tub with her murderous father-in-law . " Just one of his men-at-arms , " Persephone admitted , " but it was not fatal . Now they are trying to trade me for Alexi D'Hay . " " Cousin Alexi ? " Helena asked . " I thought he was safe in Hebektahay Castle . " " He has given himself to me , " Persephone informed Helena primly . Helena smiled at Natasha , saying , " Seems to be all the rage . " " Would that everyone were so cooperative . " Persephone shook her head , saying , " Baron D'Brovnik is a horrible optimist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has sent a demand to my sister Kore , the Dark Daughter , offering my life for Alexi . " Natasha doubted that she would readily give her life for spoiled , arrogant Alexi D'Hay , but she knew that Persephone would do it in a heartbeat . She asked , " Will your sister Kore agree to trade ? " Persephone smiled mirthlessly . " However much men might fear me , my older sister is ten times worse . I may be the Killer of Children , but Kore is Death herself - if she comes south at all , it will be to kill Baron D'Brovnik . " " Is your sister really so terrible ? " Helena sounded impressed . " Been feeding me snake venom since I was six , " Persephone declared proudly . " It is what keeps us close . " Natasha guessed Kore would ruthlessly avenge Persephone , but not offer up any children for her safety . She asked her mistress , " What will we do ? " " First we must talk with the nuns . " Persephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not surprisingly , the Mother Superior to the little nunnery stood outside , veiled and swathed in fabric , only her eyes showing , glaring at the demi-goddess . Persephone asked , " Do you know who I am ? " " I know , " the nun nodded . " You are a godless lawless witch , who nearly killed a man in our bathhouse . " " Men have no business being in a nuns " bathhouse , " Persephone pointed out . " Small reason to kill him , " sniffed the Mother Superior . " If I meant to kill him , he would be dead , " Persephone replied blandly . " Keep men out and there will be no trouble . " " They are not always easy to keep out . " Not even for a nun . " Well at least try to have them castrated first , " Persephone suggested , " this is a haram for Heaven 's sake . Until you can run it properly these children are under my protection , including the unborn . " Persephone nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Mother Superior insisted . " Your mere being here puts them all at risk . Twenty years ago , when Baron D'Brovnik first took power , he had every inmate in the Gilded Cage strangled - to make a fresh start . Nuns had to listen to their cries , and we do not want such terrible times to come again . " Who did ? Persephone patiently explained , " I did not mean to be here , that too was Baron D'Brovnik 's doing . He puts the children at risk , not me . Keep men out of the haram , and I will not have to kill them . And if you give me a pigeon offering each day , I promise to be gone as soon as I can . " " A pigeon ? " Mother Superior thought that sounded suspiciously easy . " From the Church of the Black Virgin in Brovazamak , " Persephone stipulated . " One live pigeon a day , and tell them who it is for - do that , and I vow to leave as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may take the whole coop . " Mother Superior turned and departed , leaving Natasha still another nun to deal with , Sister Ida , whom she left locked in her apartment , stripped of her habit and veil , nursing a bottle of peach brandy . Sister Ida was astonished to see her wayward novice return with the much mourned Helena and the Killer of Children . Though the surprised nun put a happy face on things , seeing Helena come skipping back from the dead had to be disappointing . While they talked , Sister Ida took wistful looks at the two teenagers , between hits of peach brandy , and when time came for her to go , the drunk nun took Natasha aside for a private good-bye , whispering , " She will never love you like I do . " Probably true , but even if Natasha could not have Helena 's fickle love , she meant to face life afresh , and hopefully serve Persephone . Since this was most likely a long good-bye , she gave Sister Ida a passionate thankful kiss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I was in desperate need . Take care . " Then Sister Ida was gone , leaving just a taste of peach brandy on Natasha 's tongue . Each day thereafter the nuns brought a pigeon , and Persephone would write out a tiny note , attaching it to the bird 's leg . Then she would release the bird , letting it fly off through the gleaming bars of the Gilded Cage . Natasha asked , " Will Eros come ? " Persephone nodded . " If he can . Eros is a wonder , when he puts his mind to it . But that means danger too , for when Eros arrives , D'Brovniks will come battering at the Golden Door . We must be ready . " Eros arrived in the stillness of noon , dropping on roc back out of a blue cloudless sky onto the bars of the Gilded Cage . Children shouted and pointed at the barred sky , alerting the other inmates . His bird alighted atop the bars , and Eros attached a grapple to the cage , letting Selene reel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiver , lowering them three stories to Persephone . Fully armed again , the Killer of Children told Natasha , " Collect the children . I will bar the Golden Door . " Persephone dashed off , while Natasha did a head count , finding all the children were already together , gawking up at Eros , striding about atop their cage , wearing a light tunic and kilt , and hung like a demi-god , his golden crossbow slung across his back . As Selene reeled herself in , crewmen swarmed down the grapple line , attacking the gilded bars with hardened steel saws . Natasha ran to tell Persephone the children were ready , finding nuns piling everything they could against the Golden Door . Men were already banging on the far side , angrily demanding entry . Having only one door was handy for keeping prisoners in , but it also made the Cage into a natural fortress , with the blank windowless third story rearing above the haram 's rooftop gardens . But the D'Brovkniks knew all about bringing down fortresses , and Natasha heard the creak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boxes flying off the barricade . They had wheeled a battering ram into the big entrance chamber with the cherubs , meaning to beat in the Golden Door . Natasha returned to the courtyard in time to shoo children to safety as the first gilded bar came crashing down . It was a race now , between the battering ram at the Golden Door and the crewmen cutting into the cage . Even with only one bar down , the gap was wide enough for a child , and Alexi came sliding down on a sling . Eros had kept Persephone 's promise to treat him like a regular boy - as D'Hay heir he would never have gone down the line into danger . And he reveled in it , helping load the smaller children one-by-one into the sling for the return trip . Seeing she could leave the loading to others , Natasha went to tell Persephone , " One bar is down , and Eros is lifting out the children . " " Good , " Persephone told her , " because the Golden Door is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a great heave , and half of it tumbled aside . Another booming crash , and gilded splinters shot across the room . Nuns looked on in anguish , telling their beads , knowing the D'Brovniks were coming through . Another bang , and Natasha saw the Golden Door disintegrate in a cloud of splinters . Suddenly she could see into the chamber of the cherubs beyond , where men with axes chopped at what was left of the barricade , backed by Kazak archers surrounding Baron D'Brovnik and his ensign , both in full armor . Behind them loomed the huge battering ram , tipped with a giant steel fist . Kazak arrows zipped through the gap , scattering the nuns . Persephone sent a single slim hypodermic shaft in reply - straight through the left eye-slit of Baron D'Brovnik 's old-fashioned great helm . Spinning about , the Killer of Children grabbed Natasha by the collar , dragging her through the little nunnery and into the courtyard , locking the door behind them . And the door to the bath as well - though in minutes D'Brovniks would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the galleries . All the children were gone except for Alexi D'Hay - but the gap above was too small for anyone else . Natasha , Helena , and Persephone were still locked in the Gilded Cage . Axe men beat at the doors as Natasha looped the sling around Alexi , and saw him hoisted aloft . Exceedingly proud to be the last boy out of the Cage , Alexi called down to her , " I will tell Eros to hurry . " No need . As Alexi went up , the second bar down came down , nearly braining him on the way . Now they could get through , but the sling was around Alexi 's waist , and they had to wait for him to be hoisted up , and the line to come back down , all the time listening to axes beating on splintering wood . When the sling came back , Natasha slid it around Helena , giving her a swift kiss , glad mother and baby would get away . As they kissed , the bath house door flew off its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kazaks . There would be no return trip . This was the last sling load out , and not surprisingly it went to Helena . Natasha 's true love lived a charmed life . Long given up for dead , Helena would be the one to get away , alive and free , carrying a baby that was heir to two baronies , while Natasha and the Killer of Children stayed to face some justifiably angry D'Brovniks . Oddly , Natasha would not have it any other way . Nor Persephone either . Before Natasha could let go of Helena , Persephone seized both of them from behind , shouting , " Hold on ! " Natasha did , sliding an arm through the sling as the line suddenly took off , easily lifting the three of them . Looking down , Natasha saw surprised men 's faces staring open-mouthed back at her . Archers raised their bows to fire , at a range where Kazaks could not miss . As they did , water came cascading down in their faces , blinding the bowmen and spoiling their arrows . Eros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballast , making the skyship shoot upward , dragging the sling up with it . In seconds Natasha was drawn right up out of the Gilded Cage , like she was on a line headed straight to heaven , seeing the haram 's rooftop gardens recede beneath her . Brovazamak lay spread out below , the haram and fortress-palace , the castle town , and the big bend in the Brovva cutting through the black earth steppe , all dwindling to doll-size below her . She was flying free , safe so long as no one let go . Slowly the skyship 's windlass reeled them up , then Eros and the mews boys hauled them aboard . Natasha found herself standing on Selene 's narrow deck , with Helena beside her , while the skyship floated effortlessly at her pressure height . Leaning idly against the port rail , humming a Persian love song , Eros noticed one of Persephone 's arrows was missing , and asked , " Where did that shaft go ? " " Through Baron D'Brovnik 's left eye-slit , " replied Persephone evenly , sounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and asked Natasha , " Did you see it ? " To which she nodded yes , hardly believing it now , but clearly remembering the shaft going in , and D'Brovnik 's head jerking back , with the arrow 's feathers sprouting from his armored face . Helena asked , " Then if this baby is a boy , is he the new Baron D'Brovnik ? " " Not yet . " Persephone smiled at Helena 's eagerness . " Baron D'Brovnik is a long way from dead . " " But Natasha saw you shoot him ! " Alexi insisted , wanting one dead enemy out of all this mayhem . " Just with leprosy , " Persephone protested . " Death has small use for Baron D'Brovnik - at the moment anyway - besides , I am just the Killer of Children . Men , I mostly leave to my sister . But only one eye and a virulent case of leprosy will slow the nervous baron down nicely , doing wonders for everyone . " Baron D'Brovnik had far too much time on his hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persephone went on to say they must sort through the children , " separating out those who have homes to return to from those we must find homes for . " Natasha nodded , guessing Alexi 's days as an ordinary boy were numbered - but if he lived to be Lord D'Hay , his stay with the Killer of Children would not be forgotten . Seeing the children clustered together on the foredeck , ecstatic to be free and flying magically through the air , Natasha found they seemed strangely small to her , so fragile and different - yet short years ago she hadbeen so solidly one of them . And now Helena had another child inside her , which was bound to make Natasha a foster mother as well . Teetering on the edge of adulthood , Natasha remembered Persephone 's warning , that time was the true killer of children . <p>
