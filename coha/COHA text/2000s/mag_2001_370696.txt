As temperatures soar , the cool blue waters of a swimming pool can seem pretty inviting . But perhaps you should look twice before you take that dip . Thousands of Americans may get sick this summer from the unsanitary condition of their pool water , according to the Centers for Disease Control . The last thing you want to think about when you 're swimming is what tiny creatures might be swimming beside you . But the fact is that any pool can be contaminated with parasites and bacteria . If you 're not careful , you could find yourself in the emergency room with a badly upset stomach or a scary-looking rash . <P> The biggest culprit seems to be a parasite called Cryptosporidium . It multiplies in the gastrointestinal tract and can escape through a leaky diaper or other poolside accident and , if swallowed , can cause a distressing bout of diarrhea . Cryptosporidium is highly chlorine resistant and can survive in pool water for days . E. coli , another escapee from the gut known to cause outbreaks of stomach malaise , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check with careful pool maintenance . <P> As a first precaution , take a close look at the water before you jump in . Its color and texture are good indicators of its cleanliness . It should be clear enough for you to see through at least 10 ft. of water and distinguish objects such as a metal grating on the bottom of the pool . Foamy or bubbling water along the pool 's edge is a sign of potential trouble ; it typically represents excessive organic matter , such as pollen or bacteria . If the water looks clear enough to enter , the next line of defense is to keep your mouth shut . As we swim , many of us unknowingly swallow water  --  along with any microbes that might be in it . <P> The best defense is a good offense , fighting the contaminants at their source . Be wary of babies wearing diapers . Parents should be changing them frequently and cleaning up thoroughly , even if the little ones are wearing so-called waterproof diapers .

And whether you 've changed a baby or gone to the bathroom yourself , you should always wash your hands with soap and water before re-entering a pool . <P> Chlorine is still the most popular weapon against contaminated pool water . Home pools should be tested at least once a day ; many public pools are checked every one to three hours , depending on the number of swimmers . Because bugs love warmth , heated pools and Jacuzzis require more rigorous testing and higher levels of chlorine . If you are feeling particularly vigilant , you might pick up one of those $10 home-pool testing kits that measure the water 's pH level to make sure it 's in a safe range . And then enjoy your swim ! <P> Dr. Ian appears on NBC 's Today show .
