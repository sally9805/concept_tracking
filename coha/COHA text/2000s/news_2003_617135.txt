<p> Thank Orville and Wilbur Wright for the fresh lobsters you 'll crack open this week . <p> And for the gifts that are being jetted in from relatives in other states and for the college kids who 'll be arriving by air from far-flung campuses where  --  not so very long ago  --  they would have been blue for the holidays , facing endless ribbons of black highway . <p> It was 100 years ago today that the brothers Wright took their first powered flight , forever changing not just the transportation world , but our lifestyles , from momentous events to the trivial . <p> And it has affected the whole world , too , of course . Who , a half century ago , had heard of Iraq , let alone dreamed in their worst nightmares that their grandchildren from Georgia might wind up there for a war ? <p> " Flight redefined the way we think , not just the way we think of time , " says Janet Bednarek , author of a couple of books on the origins of aviation and chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wright brothers ' hometown . <p> Air travel has made Atlanta a national transportation hub , a place from which we can get to almost any place in the world we want . Or do n't want . It 's created tens of thousands of jobs and a major destination for conventioneers , which is why we 're known around the country as a strip-club haven . <p> It 's even changed our accents . There are 4 million folks in the metro area , but how often do you hear a Southern drawl ? Whateva would Scarlett think ? <p> Moreover , it 's turned the sleepy town that Sherman burned down into a giant megalopolis where $1 million houses are a dime a dozen . It 's spawned a giant Roman legion of business executives like Derek Raymer , 39 , of Marietta , who fly around the country every week because they can make more money hopscotching from place to place than staying put . <p> And it 's made it a snap for people like Kimberly Krautter , a 39-year-old Atlantan , to carry on romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years of commuting from coast to coast for work and for love , she 's now got a boyfriend in the romantic city of Paris . <p> " Time became space when flight began , " Bednarek said . " Families can be more scattered but get together more often . And going overseas or traveling anywhere by plane is not just something for the rich . " <p> About 77 million people pass through Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport a day , compared with a mere 439,000 some 30 years ago . <p> And because many of those get off here for conventions or business calls , the hospitality industry has mushroomed . No longer are the steaks we eat cut from cattle reared on the ranges of Gwinnett County or is seafood seen only in frozen boxes in groceries . <p> Fresh meat is flown in daily , as are tens of thousands of live lobsters from Maine , Boston , even Seattle . <p> " We sell 20,000 pounds of live lobsters a week , " said Joel Knox , owner of Inland Seafood Co. , the largest seafood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's something over 14,000 lobsters . " <p> And his is n't the only distributing company . <p> Prime cuts of beef arrive here daily from across the country , but also from as far as Argentina , which exported $55 million worth to the United States last year . <p> Strengthening rights <p> Flight has also had other momentous consequences for society  --  most notably for blacks and women . <p> It was the Tuskegee Airmen , the famed black pilots of World War II , whose heroic exploits in combat in Europe lead directly to the desegregation of the United States military in 1948 . <p> Until then , blacks and whites were strictly segregated . <p> " It 's very hard to underestimate the historical significance of the Tuskegee Airmen and the larger role in changing racial attitudes in America , especially among white people , " said Richard Pratt of the University of Georgia , an expert on civil rights . <p> " Many historians will date the beginning of the modern civil rights movement to Brown v. Board of Education in ' 54 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in World War II that not only helped defeat the Nazis , but Jim Crow . " <p> Mel Archer of Stockbridge was one of the Tuskegee pilots who was first shunned by white squadron leaders who " thought we were inferior , " but then requested the black pilots because " we never lost a plane we were escorting to enemy fire . " <p> But it was n't until after the Korean War ended in 1953 that blacks were allowed to fly commercially . And they did n't have to sit in the back of the planes as long as they had the money , which relatively few did . <p> But Archer said , " We 've got a long way to go . " <p> No one compiles racial statistics on commercial pilots . But it 's estimated by professional groups that 2 percent of 145,000 commercial pilots are black . <p> Flight also gave wings to women 's rights , says Bednarek , a pilot and author of " Dreams of Flight : General Aviation in the United States " and " Reconsidering a Century of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to earn a pilot 's license , but she had to travel to France in 1921 to get it . After World War I ended in 1918 , the skies of the country were filled with barnstormers  --  pilots who performed stunts for money . And some blacks and women began pursuing careers as daredevils , hoping their exploits would fly in the face of notions that they were either not strong or smart enough to handle planes , Pratt said . <p> Many of these women , Bednarek said , were feminists . Now , only 35,000 of 612,000 licensed pilots are women . <p> Notable downsides <p> Though flight has expanded boundaries of work , love and civil rights , it 's also had some downsides , such as the spread of diseases such as SARS and AIDS , and made warfare faster , more lethal and less personal . Think cruise missiles . <p> Most baby boomers , those 50 and over like Max Falls , 59 , of Douglasville , never flew until the 1960s when they were given a free ticket to Vietnam by Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " greatest generation "  --  those who lived through the Depression and WWII  --  ever saw a plane up close , says Bob Somerville , an aviation expert in Forest Heights , Md. , and co-author of " A Century of Innovation : Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives . " <p> What started off as a privilege reserved for the elite has turned into a kind of steerage , with bad service and unreliable departure schedules , he said . <p> Nowadays , about 80 percent of Americans older than 20 have flown , said Bednarek , and flying is seen as about as prestigious as taking a bus . <p> " You had to have money to fly in the ' 30s and ' 40s and coach fares were started in the ' 50s , " she said . " But it 's never been cheap , only cheaper , but the elitist bias has gone . " <p> Former Atlanta Mayor Sam Massell , 76 , said flying used to be the domain of the elite , that men would wear business suits and ties and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandals , sleeveless shirts or miniskirts . And there was no body odor . Imagine that ! <p> Until the mid- ' 60s , millions of Americans around the country would go to their local airports on Sundays just to watch planes take off and land  --  Massell included . The old Atlanta airport used to have an observation deck where the curious could pay a dime just to sit and watch . <p> It 's those dimes that make Derek Raymer love his flying lifestyle , because he makes a lot more money traveling than he would if he just did computer consulting at home . <p> " Sure , I miss a lot of things , my boys  --  John , 8 , and Billy , 9  --  my wife , Susan , " he said , " but I do a lot with them . And the extra money makes other things possible . " <p> Not to mention the frequent flier points . <p> Next Christmas , he 's planning to take the whole family to Hawaii for a week and figures he wo n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aviation has been humongous , " Raymer said . " And for us , really humongous . It 's giving us the chance to do something we 'd never have been able to do . " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : December 18 , 2003 Thursday <p> CORRECTION : Approximately 77 million passengers fly through Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport each year . A story on the 100th anniversary of flight in Wednesday 's Living section incorrectly said that was the number of passengers in the airport per day . Some changes wrought , directly or indirectly , by the Wright brothers : <p> * More dangerous world : Just consider the four U.S. planes that were turned into missiles by terrorists on Sept. 11 , 2001 . <p> * More lethal wars : Think cruise missiles , stealth bombers and wars dominated by air attacks , as in Iraq and every conflict since World War I. <p> * A global village : Breakfast in Atlanta , lunch in London and dinner in Paris . Dessert ? Cappuccino in Rome . <p> * By the numbers : There are 612,000 licensed pilots and 19,000 airports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1926 , compared with 559 million last year . Only 1,000 people flew internationally in 1928 , compared with 53 million last year . MEMORIES ALOFT Here 's what some people say about what they remember most about flying . John M. Davis , 73 , of Atlanta : This Korean War veteran flew for the first time at age 19 , when he was in the Navy . He never thought about flying before that . " You 'd take a train . Until about ' 65 , air travel was for extreme emergencies . When my children were young , we 'd go to airports just to watch . It was fun . Even at the old Hartsfield , they had an observation deck for people to watch . " Paul Connelly , bombardier in B-17 , 8th Air Force , who flew 35 missions over Germany : " I flew when I was 7 or 8 , when my father took me and my older sister up in a plane flown by a barnstorming pilot . I sat in the back seat . The next time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had terrible losses . But I do n't blame the war on the Wright brothers . " Steve Davis , 55 , an Atlanta historian and author : " The first time I flew I was about 3 . I barfed my innards out . But now I fly all the time , even though it 's a nuisance . I must look like a terrorist because I always have to take off my shoes . " George Max Falls , 59 , of Douglasville : " First time I flew I was in the Army and went from Fort Benning to Fort Polk , then to Vietnam . The first flight was a prop job , and there came a real bad storm , lightning all around . I got a little tense on that one . " Now the owner of a furniture company , he gets on a plane about twice a year . " I do n't mind it , but I do mind going through all that at the airport . "  --  Bill Hendrick
