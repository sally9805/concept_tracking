Five Money-Saving Tips HOW TO CUT COSTS WITHOUT CHANGING CARRIERS <P> 1 HOLD THE ROAM Many service plans charge extra for analog roaming or for digital roaming outside your specified region . If your phone has the capability , try setting it to digital roam only , or setting it to alert you when it moves into analog territory . You could save yourself from some ugly charges . <P> 2 DO THE MATH Bill compiling is n't an exact science , so it pays to check for errors . If you find a mistake , or even if you think you 've found one , call and be firm . If you stick to the matter at hand ( and do n't raise your voice ) , you 'll probably get a break . <P> 3 MIND YOUR MINUTES If you 're not using all your minutes , see if you can get a cheaper plan . If you know you need more minutes , say , for a summer vacation , switch your plan in advance . As long as you do n't mind renewing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as often as you like . Here 's a secret : ask for the cancellation department ; it often offers the best deals . <P> 4 UPDATE YOUR PHONE If you 're not happy with the performance of your aging phone , do n't buy a new one right away . See if you can get a free software update . If it works  --  and that is n't guaranteed  --  your phone will access more cell towers and probably give you better reception . <P> 5 DROP YOUR PLAN If you need your phone only for road emergencies , you may want to drop to a pre-paid refillable calling card or cancel your plan altogether . Calling cards , which expire on a fixed date , are sold in less expensive blocks of minutes . Phones without service can usually still get through to 911 . <P> HIGH-TECH PHONES AT A GLANCE <P> SONY ERICSSON T68i Comes with GPRS data capability , color screen , Bluetooth wireless and multimedia messaging motorola i95cl A full-color phone that can run Nextel 's Java-based business tools and games <P> VERIZON WIRELESS Z-800 One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video games , photo albums and map-based navigation <P> MOTOROLA V70 Makes a fashion statement with its " switchblade " cover and white-on-black display .
