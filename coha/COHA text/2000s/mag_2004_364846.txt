Swept up by their emotions over Ronald Reagan 's death , congressional Republicans last week could n't think of enough ways to honor their conservative hero . The ideas ranged from putting his picture on the $10 bill to renaming the Pentagon the Ronald Reagan National Defense Building to carving Reagan 's face on Mount Rushmore . ( The late President already has an airport , a giant trade building in Washington and an aircraft carrier bearing his name . ) <P> But the ardor to move quickly to shower Reagan with more memorials has since " cooled a little bit " among Republican congressional leaders , a G.O.P. Senator tells TIME . " There 's been a step back to take a little more measured approach . " Neither the House nor the Senate plans to rush bills to the floor to put Reagan 's face on a piece of currency or to name the Pentagon after him , say senior aides in both chambers . George Bush also has hedged on whether he would support such moves , saying only that he " will reflect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic leaders are playing it carefully . " I think we have to allow historians and others with some thought to consider how we might best remember President Reagan officially , " says Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle . But even Republicans like Senator John Warner are chary of renaming the Pentagon , which has been considered a symbol of bipartisanship , after a political figure . Some Republicans also believe that their party and Bush need to focus for now on what will be a difficult campaign and not continue to feed off Reagan nostalgia . President Bush clearly benefits by tying himself closely to Reagan 's memory , which fires up the conservative Republican base . " But every day we spend talking about how great Ronald Reagan is does not necessarily help the current occupant of the White House , " says a G.O.P. official . " Anytime there has been a king and the prince is trying to take over his legacy , it 's not good that everybody keeps talking about the king .
