LOUIS The Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts , housed in Tadao Ando s first public structure in the US. , brings a dialogue between art and architecture to the city s revitalized downtown . The working relationship of the three participants in the panel discussion that marked the opening last October of St. Louis 's Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts ( PFA ) was the readiest key to understanding the unique nature of the new institution . Moderated by board member Angelica Zander Rudenstine , the conversation included architect Tadao Ando of Osaka along with artists Ellsworth Kelly and Richard Serra of New York . Ando designed the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major work for display there . In itself , there was nothing unusual about people of differing disciplines sharing a stage at the inauguration of a major art facility . What sticks in memory , however , is the manner in which these three men had earlier approached their respective-or , more precisely , their communal-tasks . Kelly ostensibly conceived his wall piece , Blue Black , a two-panel work of painted honeycomb aluminum , to fit the setting Ando had created for him . But before the work was finally hung , Kelly made adjustments in the proportions of the architect 's design to suit his own purposes . Similarly Serra , for whose sculpture a full-scale courtyard had been specially constructed , managed to fix the final measurements of that space . It is extremely rare for painters or sculptors to actively participate in the design of a building awaiting their work . In this instance , they were able to do so largely because the $17-million cost of the project was met not by a corporate sponsor but solely by a couple , Emily Rauh Pulitzer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were inclined to serve the artists to an exceptional degree . Emily Pulitzer has made her position clear : " I think that all too often , an architect designs a building , and then art is put into it in ways that damage the effect of the art and of the building as well . " Yet she admits that the collaborative process was not always easy : " It could n't be . As Ando has said , each party wanted his work to be enhanced , not compromised . " ' Almost a year has passed since the Pulitzer Foundation opened its doors , a span long enough to warrant an assessment of the success attained by this unusual interplay of art and architecture . Emily Pulitzer should feel justified . The building  --  encompassing 27,000 square feet of interior space and a 16,000-square-foot exterior court-looks as good now as it did last year , both in itself and as a setting for the art it shows . A by-appointment study center more than a conventional museum , the PFA houses galleries and a library but no shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the work on view consists of examples drawn from the Pulitzers ' own collection . While Kelly and Serra have been granted pride of place in the finished institution , the highest honors belong to the architect . The PFA is Ando 's first public building in the U.S. , and since it bears a close resemblance to his work in Japan , which helped to win him the Pritzker Prize in 1995 , it enables us to judge him at his best . The first impressions made by the exterior of the building are the hard rectilinearity of the composition and the sobering gray of the concrete , both traits especially notable in the extended wall that shields the main mass from the street . A cantilevered roof is visible just beyond the barrier . The wall conceals the entryway to a lobby , where the viewer begins to get some sense of the long U-shaped interior plan . At center stretches a shallow open-air reflecting pool lined with gravel and flanked by parallel wings , one slightly taller than the other . Moving to the left , visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoing the pool , is far longer than it is wide . The space , hung with paintings and large drawings by Lichtenstein , Warhol , Guston , Kelly and Serra , divides at one end into a balcony and a monumental staircase . The stairs descend to a two-story cove , top-lit , its rear wall given over exclusively to Kelly 's narrow , 28-foot-high wall piece , which has been brightly visible along the 170-foot length of the gallery . Here the remarkable cooperation between artist and architect makes itself felt . The balcony leads to a door that the viewer sees as a rectangle consistent with-indeed , almost a part of-the shapes of the wall piece . It was the height of this door that Kelly altered , with Ando 's approval . Ando , for his part , bathes the space around the wall piece in indirect illumination , a masterly confirmation of his reputation for employing natural light as a constructive element in his architecture . At this point , two small galleries are within immediate reach , one built directly above the other . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of its shape , features two paintings by Rothko , one by Serra and a bench designed by Ando . Below it is the Cubist Gallery , filled with canvases by Picasso , Braque , and Gris as well as sculptures by Matisse and Giacometti . The visitor 's route then doubles back to the great staircase , the painting gallery and the lobby again . The last of these spaces , with its multiple perspectives , is the most visually varied in the foundation . A glass partition faces a concrete wall with a cantilevered staircase that leads upward to a sitting area overlooking the roof terrace of the lower , or office , wing . The terrace is planted with dwarf bamboo , akin in its lightness to the reflecting pool 's water and in bold contrast with the pervasive concrete , the material most frequently associated with Ando . The architect has his own method of treating the substance . A high degree of polish is achieved when the shaping plywood forms are faced with smooth plastic and the concrete is vibrated as it is being poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a modular layout of tidy , cylindrical indentations , each a trace of the end of one of the rods that connect the sides of the form together . The resultant pattern is the only component of the design that might be called decorative . Remaining to be traversed is the outer court , animated by the two generously proportioned flights of stairs that recall the staircase of the main gallery as they lead downward from a space walled in on three sides . There below stands the Serra sculpture , which the artist titled Joe in honor of Joseph Pulitzer . It is a massive torqued spiral in CorTen steel , still rust-colored , as it will be until it eventually turns a dull maroon . If Kelly shares with Ando a preference for the rectangle , Serra 's curves and diagonals are his own , yet fully in keeping with the architect 's fundamental devotion to clarity of form and austerity of mood .

" This blossoming of modern architecture , " he says , " was possible here because of two things : the booming economy , of course , but also the legacy of the Chicago School , whose architectural innovation opened the way for this to happen . " His further admiration for two specific designers , Louis Kahn and Mies van der Rohe , seems materially evident in the resemblance that the Pulitzer Foundation bears to Kahn 's Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth and to Mies 's Barcelona Pavilion . Mies comes even more emphatically to mind when one considers Ando 's treatment of walls , which is as expressive as it is functional . This is especially apparent in the wall along the north side that conceals the entrance and those several that are freestanding as they surround the outer court . The foundation traces its history to 1990 , when the Pulitzers became active in the revitalization of the Grand Center neighborhood of St. Louis , an area that had long functioned as a lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An existing space was acquired that would have accommodated portions of the Pulitzer collection , and Ando was requested to carry out a renovation . That project , however , was put on hold following Joseph Pulitzer 's death in 1993 . New land was obtained several years later . Ando was rehired to design the purpose-built structure that now houses the foundation . The building joins a number of new or refurbished facilities in Grand Center , including Powell Symphony Hall ( home of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra ) , the Sheldon ( another concert hall ) , the Fox Theater ( a former movie palace now hosting stage shows ) , the Grandel Theatre ( site of the St. Louis Black Repertory Company 's productions as well as series of cabaret performances ) and the quarters of KETC/Channel 9 ( the city 's public television station ) . The presence of the PFA only adds to the hopes these achievements have engendered . When its immediate next-door neighbor , a new facility for the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis , is finished in April 2003 , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pulitzers ' dream will be even closer to fulfillment than it is today . 1 .
