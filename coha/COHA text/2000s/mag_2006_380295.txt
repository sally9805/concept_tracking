For many Israelis , he was a builder and a bulwark ; for Palestinians , a destroyer and a deterrent . TIME invited an international panel of experts to reflect on the Prime Minister 's place in history and the prospects for peace when he is gone <P> NATAN SHARANSKY Former Likud Minister and author of The Case for Democracy : I have always believed that real progress in the peace process will come from democratic reforms in Palestinian society . That was the reason for my criticism of Sharon 's policy over the past two years . I believed that Sharon 's unilateral moves would take us nowhere as long as they were not accompanied by some real democratic reforms on the other side . The question of whether the Palestinians can establish democracy will have a greater bearing on the peace process than will the end of Sharon 's political career . At the same time , Sharon always demonstrated courage as a leader who takes responsibility for his actions . So many decisions are made now on opportunistic grounds or for fear of being punished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was ready to take responsibility for them . I very much hope that other politicians will emulate this quality .
