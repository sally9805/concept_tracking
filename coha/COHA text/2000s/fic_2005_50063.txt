ARCHIBETTO SAT ON THE piled cargo bales and fingered his curved blade as the barge Peregrinator crept slowly toward Ferrara . It was a few minutes before sunrise , the very time of day when bandits would be most likely to attack , and Archibetto was certain that the Peregrinator 's four crossbowmen - who had been tippling mightily last night - would be in no condition to repel boarders . An owl cried out in the dawn gloom , and Archibetto pivoted slowly , turning in each direction . The valley farms and woods were gray and indistinct in the morning light , patterns and shapes only . Water sloshed against the hull of the barge , and the steady clop of the towhorses brought sound to the scene , but beyond the canal nothing was stirring . <p> Archibetto felt certain that this commission would set him up , possibly for years to come . He was confident that he could provide any service that the Magister might require and Archibetto had brought along thousands of ducats ' worth of equipment to ensure success , elementum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newest forms of Fenestnim , which were far superior to the Malum Opera products he 'd been using . It was a stellar coup . His competitor Zucca would be furious . <p> The sun , rising fast now , backlit the ridgelines above the Po Valley , and Archibetto sensed rather than saw the horsemen . There were a dozen or more , banners carried at their head . Definitely not common marauders . Perhaps they were a local lord 's guard . Archibetto felt a warning chill . Some of these local lords were no better than bandit chieftains . He watched as the horsemen turned to converge , heading for an arching bridge over the canal on which the Peregrinator traveled . The bargeman looked apprehensively at Archibetto . <p> " Who are they ? " Archibetto asked . " Some local princeling 's guard ? " <p> " No , Eiuditus . They carry the keys . " <p> Stercus . An emissary of Pope Alexander , free to move without let or hindrance in pursuit of the Papal will . And , please God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the lead horseman pulled up at the bridge and dismounted . A moment later came the clear call of the bridgeman 's horn . Stercus infelix ! <p> The bargeman looked back apologetically . " I 'm sorry , Eruditus . They mean to board us . Better put that fish-gutter away . " <p> Archibetto 's heart sank , but he sheathed his knife as the bargeman began to bang his foot on the deck . After a moment , sleepy guards and passengers trickled up out of the companionway , pulling themselves together as the bargeman guided his vessel toward the dock . <p> The ceremonial horsemen remained mounted while a fat man in rich white robes made his way down to the dock , trailed by his two Assistants . Archibetto knew of these " Assistants , " seeming humble clerks trained also as assassins and spies , percontatore , ultimately answerable only to the Black Chamber - or so the stories said . <p> Archibetto stamped on the planking to drive away the cold , for the stories also held that Inquisitor General Torquemada was dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , which was why he was called " Gloomy Gus , " the eternal pessimist . But Augusto Archibetto was not a negative man . He was reactive , a happy man in good times , a grumbler in bad . No wonder he had never married . <p> The bargeman brought his charge expertly up against the rope fenders . The crossbowmen were trying to look military , but under the gaze of the Papal Legate they wilted into pathetic time-servers , worth neither respect nor notice . As the gangway went over to the dock , the shining white Legate stumped up the plank with his staff of office banging a counterpoint . He marched right up to Archibetto . <p> " Eiuditus Augusto Benedetto Archibetto ? " <p> Archibetto nodded , not trusting himself to speak . The Legate 's head looked like a great ball of yellow cheese with a face . Archibetto 's stomach rumbled . He suspected that he was not going to get breakfast . <p> " You are summoned to appear in a judgment before the Vatican Council of Temporal Miracles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . " <p> " But , but , " Archibetto stammered , " my cargo . It is precious and destined for the Magister Michelangelo . " <p> The Legate smiled placidly . " Your cargo will be coming with us . It too will be judged . And as for the Magister , I am sure that we shall come round to him presently . " <p> The consignment , carefully padded and packed in a great road wagon , was on its way to Rome , to the papal palace and the stern-faced judges who would determine the fate of his enterprise and , in all probability , his life . Archibetto sat on the load , eating the cheese and oranges provided by one of Legate Graziani 's Assistants . There was wine and bread to last the trip to Rome , that white-gray smudge in the distance . <p> The countryside along the road was simple in its beauty ; people going about their daily lives , secure in the blessings of the Church and as yet untouched by the secular magicks of dynamos and Computes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him , the new men , the bringers of progress . Provided the Inquisition approved . <p> It was not that Archibetto himself had done anything to arouse the attention of the Wandering Eye of Blame , but it was the new technologies that were pouring out of the workshops of da Vinci and Regimundi and Remigio , which were taking all of the Italian lands by storm . So far , the see had reserved comment , - but now the winds were changing . Archibetto tried not to follow this line of thought too far , but it seemed likely that he was going to get soaked . The repercussions from missing his installment agreement with the Magister would be bad , but not so bad as if he disobeyed the Inquisition - everyone knew their power , their intolerance , and their zeal in ferreting out the enemies of the Church . <p> The discovery of the Principle of Dynamic Storage fifty years earlier by Giotto Panzi had led to the great collector banks growing up around each city and palace , dynamos pouring from the interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wire wheels and magnets . Soon would come dynamos produced through falling water and perhaps even the tides . <p> When the banks became portable , the batteries appeared which led to the self-propelled barge and the first experiments with electrical vehicles . ( Andreas Locomeli was planning a car that would carry people and cargo on metal rails from Rome to Ostia . ) Then , twelve years ago had come the Computes . <p> " Eiuditas , " the wagon driver called , " we are almost there . Time to change into your best . " <p> HIS FINEST ROBES were hot and sweatlogged on the inside and covered in dust without when at last Archibetto and his escort entered the Holy Precincts . The Legate was met in the outer courtyard by a retinue of Ammanuensi , Servitors , and Ordinaries , while the two Assistants guided Archibetto off to a small and forbidding archway . <p> " Where are you taking me ? " <p> " Silence , prisoner . You 'll learn in time . " <p> " Why am I a prisoner ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He was locked into a small room with one barred window through which he could see and hear the loud and bustling city of Rome . The city might as well have been in Persia or far Cathay , for the chamber , though comfortable , was unmistakably a cell . There was simple food , candles , a hard bed , and he was allowed two daily trips to the garderobe . Otherwise , they left him alone for three days to ponder and worry . And being Archibetto , he worried with great enthusiasm . <p> Then a strange thing happened . By the end of the third day he had begun to manifest a deep calm , an optimism - almost an enthusiasm - for what might lay ahead . Having nothing to occupy his fevered brain , and being unwilling to descend into self-abuse within the sacred precincts , he had spent an increasing amount of time thinking about the only woman he had ever loved . And lost . Twice . Once to another man and once , finally , to death . <p> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport company in Modena , in charge of scores of wagons and hundreds of tough little mules . He called her the Mule Woman , and she called him the Word Man , for in those days he had been both a scribe and a poet . They were similar - yet different - and for a time they had been lovers , but she left him for another . For a time after that they had maintained a friendship , an association that both his friends and her new lover had found to be unnatural . He ignored his friends , and Maria kept her lover in line the way she ran her mules , firmly but with kindness . Then one of the fevers that were endemic to the river valleys of the Po Basin had carried off his Mule Woman , her lover , and most of his friends , and when Portas offered him a position in the new field of Computes , he accepted . It was a path out of the fever-stripped town , to a release from sorrow and toward wealth and travel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vatican . <p> But Maria had always admonished him to look on the positive side of life , to find something in which to believe , to share in the happiness of the moment . With nothing else to occupy his time , Archibetto meditated on Maria and her simple wisdoms and the fact that she had taught him a good lesson . " I do not know how I shall react if put to the question , " he decided , " but at this time I am whole , and that 's a blessing . " He closed his eyes , saw her sweet , impish face in his mind , and waited . <p> On the morning of the fourth day an Inquisitor came for him . This was no Assistant in sheep 's clothing , but a fully caparisoned member of the secular Arm of Faith . With polite words , he invited Archibetto to accompany him to the Council Chambers and , with equal politeness , Archibetto accepted . Putting his mind to such peace as he could gather , he donned his most somber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surprise to him to see Portas waiting within the Chambers and his entire consignment laid out on tables in the Great Hall , a magnificent space of arching columns and a vaulted ceiling . High above , windows let in light , illuminating a series of frescos chilling in their depictions of heavenly justice and the rewards meted out to the fallen . Under the watchful eye of the Guards and Inquisitors , Portas was concatenating the components . He waved Archibetto over . " Help me make this system operable , my friend , " he said , his eyes bulging , sweat ringing his pudgy neck . " Work as if your life depended on it , for I think that it does . " <p> As they worked they talked in whispers . Plainy , Portas was frightfully nervous . " I understand that Operarius and his Computos are here as well , being examined in another chamber , " he said . <p> " Surely , Piaefectus , this is more than a simple product comparison . " <p> " Yes , " Portas hissed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications of dynamos . " <p> There had been rumors afoot for years that the Vatican did/did not possess dynamos and dynamic devices , and that complex and endless discussions as to the nature of these inventions and technologies had been unresolved , either by discovery or Papal Decree . There had been no statements , no papers , no pronouncements . Many assumed that the Inquisition would find fault with these inventions , but they had been silent , spending their energy instead in pursuing heretics , Jews , pagans , and unbelievers . " Perhaps we are here to determine this the hard way , " Archibetto wondered , " at the cost of lives and knowledge , and that God will give some answer . " He closed his eyes for a second and tried to summon up the face of God , but what he got was Maria the Mule Woman , her smiling face seeming to say , " Figure it out for yourself . " <p> As they finished the final , fiber-wrapped metallic connections , an Inquisitor approached , dragging a cable . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glided away . " Mmmph , " grunted Portas . " They 've got dynamic energy from somewhere . Is the grand conduit closed ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " All right , then . " Portas connected the cable to the Inflow so that the Computos could accept the dynamos . " Well , at least nothing blew up , " he said . <p> " Shall I engage the dynamos ? " <p> " No , not until the Judges give us leave , " Portas said softly , mopping his brow . " May the Blessed Virgin see fit to give us a smooth passage - " <p> " And not bedevil the system , " Archibetto added . <p> " Amen to that , Gusto . Amen to that . " <p> And so they waited ; for the Judges to arrive , for trumpets and drums , for cosmic justice , wisdom , wrath , or mercy . <p> " I hope that the Magister is not too put out , " Archibetto muttered , adjusting the position of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this today . He has a new design project and needed more stations for his Journeymen . " <p> " What are we supposed to do ? " Portas said crossly . " Say no to Il Papa ? Michael will grumble , but I 'll give him an advance copy of Fenestium VI and he 'll be delighted . " <p> " It 's ready ? " <p> " Diabolic imps still inhabit several of the subsystems . Douai is deimping them . " <p> " Douai is good , " Archibetto replied . " If anyone can do it , he can . " <p> They prattled on softly in that vein for some time until they noticed that the Guards and Inquisitors who had been observing them had withdrawn . The two men had the Great Hall to themselves . What would come next ? Arrows ? Lions ? Assassins ? <p> " Careful , " Portas hissed and jerked his head in the direction of the dim end of the huge room . A small man in white was tapping toward them with a cane . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that the man was using the cane to steady a bad leg . <p> Archibetto and Portas watched expectantly . The little man smiled and looked back at them . It was an awkward moment , made even more so when he extended a frail hand , palm down . Neither had recognized the reclusive Pope Alexander VI but they certainly knew his ring . They fell to their knees , kissing it each in turn and muttering apologias . <p> " Up , up , " he murmured . " No problems , please rise . " He unselfconsciously wiped their adoration off on his robes . " I have had more famous saliva on this hand - ugh , a grim custom . I can tell you this because , as tradesmen , no one would believe you . Do you know that they wanted to examine you en camera , a full ecclesiastical trial ? They would argue about it endlessly until the tolerant ones would grow tired and only the Inquisitors would be left , and you know how that would come out . Auto de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raw confidences pouring forth from the mouth of the Vicar of God until Il Papa stopped , glanced at the Computos and said , " So , tell me about this miracle . " <p> Portas closed his mouth , drew a deep breath , and began . " Fifty years ago , after Giotto Panzi succeeded in isolating and capturing the energy dynamic , many of the finest scholars in Italy .... " <p> Alexander raised a hand and Portas froze . " My friend , I know the history . I have read the instructive treatises . I am conversant with all of the latest opinions , both temporal and spiritual . And , because I am sure you are wondering , yes , the Holy City is wired both for dynamos and Telephonas . " <p> This came as a great shock to Archibetto who had , of course , heard rumors of the talking-machine-wire but had not believed them . The Pope went on . " Pontebello himself resides here , perfecting and developing his Tlphonas , which is simple alongside this Computos . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Church deeply concerned ; the unknown nature of your systems and their development , the persistent use by your people of angelic and demonic metaphors to describe what you do , and the ability to calculate and analyze information in ways not accessible to the Holy see - all of these aspects are troubling . They may even be heretical or Satanic . " <p> " Your Holiness , " Portas said with quiet insistence . " Our systems and research , while always open to any visitor from the Holy see , must be kept from our competitors and the general public . We need that advantage if we are to develop new systems and improvements . We reference imps and angels strictly in metaphor . It is easier to say imp , for instance , than ' unknown fault attributable to uncertain system parameters . ' " <p> Alexander nodded . " Go on . " <p> " Yes . And as to any implications of a philosophical or theological nature , we make no claims . We are merely building machines and have been given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we may make our technical advancements to the Glory of God . " <p> It was plain to Archibetto that Portas had been practicing this speech for some time . His Holiness listened , nodded , pursed his lips . After a moment he smiled . " Well said , Signer Portas - and quite what I expected you to say . " <p> A moment of panic crossed Portas 's face , but the Pope 's smile deepened . " After all , I am the Vicar of God and considered by some to be intelligent . You must permit me to anticipate all arguments ; yours , the Inquisition 's - but the final decision will , of course , be mine . " <p> And then the Pope turned to Archibetto . " And you are the one who convinces the others to buy this marvel ? The Suadeol " <p> Archibetto bowed humbly . " Holiness , while I do not conceptualize or design the Computes , my position requires me to be as knowledgeable in their operation as possible . " <p> Alexander smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Computes Fenestrum . " <p> With a glance at Portas , Archibetto turned the clavis that opened the grand conduit , and dynamos flowed into the circuit . Happily , the machine , after being dragged over half the roads in Italy , showed no hesitation . Archibetto showed /J Papa the keyboard with its ivory keys balanced on their silver tympani , how to change case and font , number and symbol . The Pope picked out his name and then looked with delight as it appeared on the speculum dynamic . <p> " At present we have only succeeded in turning Volframio 's tungsten filament to light and darkness , but I am assured that , within a few months , we shall have colors . " <p> " No ! How many ? " <p> Archibetto paused . This was leading into dangerous ground . The Church only recognized the seven colors of God 's blessed rainbow . " Why ... as many colors as God has given us , Holiness . " <p> " Amazing . God has been generous with his inspiration . " <p> Archibetto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility . He demonstrated how files were kept , added to , and protected , how to use the storage disks of pressed fiber and mica , and how mathematical calculations were accomplished . " And this can be used to make documents ? " <p> " Simple ones at present , but we are learning more and more every day . We managed to find a promising young apprentice of Leonardo 's and are training him in the elements of graphic design . Or rather , he is now training us . " <p> " You mean , on the Computosl " <p> " Si , Holiness . Allow me to show you our latest graphic program . " <p> Servitors brought food and wine and Portas dined sparingly as he watched Archibetto 's bravura performance . As the huge , clacking autoscriptor came to life , he walked over to join the Pope and his Eruditas . The great machine was grinding out a letter , a missive of greeting from the Holy see to the Sultan of the Ottomans in a demonstration that he and Archibetto had prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it critically . <p> " We are improving the quality of all our systems on a daily basis , " Portas said . <p> " And color soon ? " Alexander 's eyes twinkled in anticipation . <p> " Within three months , Holiness . It should be available to the public within a year . " <p> " Why so long a delay ? " <p> " Our experts need to de-imp the systems , " Archibetto said , then stopped , reacting to the Pope 's frown . <p> " Perhaps it would be better to use a less inf ! amatory term , one with no religious overtones . Perhaps a metaphor of insects . You might say , ' deflea . ' " <p> " An inspired idea , Your Holiness . " <p> " Do think on it . " Alexander took Archibetto 's arm and walked him down the hall . " You have made a sublime effort , my son , and it is not for naught . I am most impressed by Computes Fenestrum and I predict great things for you as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " <p> Archibetto stared , nonplussed , marveling that the most powerful human being in Christendom had just used his childhood nickname . Il Papa laughed . " I have a very efficient intelligence service . They , too , will benefit from the genius of your labors , as will the Inquisition . Bad for the heretics , good for us . <p> " And do not fret about your contract with Magister Michelangelo . His considerable talents are now in our service , and we shall see that he is well supplied with your Computos . " <p> Then Il Papa 's face grew sad and thoughtful . " I also examined the Computos Malum Opera and interviewed Operarius at some length . I found them to be stronger in the area of graphics but with less flexibility of theory . This is significant - and politically unfortunate . You must not hold yourself in any way responsible for what must happen . " <p> " Holiness ? " <p> " I told you , I read all of your technical abstracts , even the ones not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product is superior . Good for you , bad for them . " <p> ARCHIBETTO WAS never to forget those words . Two days later he and Portas were released and allowed to return to their workshops in Parma - with an order for Computos that would take five years to fill . They immediately set to expanding their workforce . Many of the new technicians came from Computos Malum Opeia , but it took a special Papal dispensation to get them released from prison . <p> For , while Computos Fenestrum prospered , the demise of Computos Malum Opera was short and bloody . Operarius , Zucca , and many of their top lieutenants were taken by the Inquisition for examination , and , after suitable questioning , to the stake . Because if the Pope had decreed Portas 's labors to be blessed of God , it must follow that Operarius and his works must be of the Devil . That was the way they thought , Archibetto realized . For every good there must be a corresponding evil , for to them life was painted in stark strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of that , he mused . Soon , we shall bring them colors . <p> - For Don Calvert <p> Author Affiliation
