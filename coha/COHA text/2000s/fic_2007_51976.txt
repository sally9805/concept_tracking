Fred Chappell says he is currently pondering the essays of Montaigne , leading through Herodotus , and enjoying Warren Rochelle 's new novel , Harvest of Changelings . He is curious about why he reads so many books that make his own stuff look so inferior , but those of us who are developing a taste for these tales of the shadow trade ( such as the one we ran in our Match 2007 issue ) can only hope that whatever feelings of inferiority he might experience wo n't deter him from spinning out more such fantasies . " WE WERE FOOLS TO COME to this place , " I said . " This place , " said the right-hand shadows . " Disgrace , " said the left-hand shadows . " We were fools , Falco , " Astolfo said , " before we were invited . You must not lose courage . " " Courage , " said the dexter shadows . " Rage , " said the sinister . " I am none a-f eared , " I said . " But I mislike these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mazes . " " The shadows do not speak , " Astolfo said . " They stand silent in their long corridors . Only a peculiarity of this dim hall 's construction makes them seem to speak . When we stop , they will stop . They own no breath . " " Breath . " " Death . " And so I said nothing more until we had pushed open the heavy door that blocked the corridor and swung it shut behind us . It might seem these doors had been hung to keep back the shadows , for the space we entered was bright with ensconced torches and batteries of flaming candles that swathed in soft glow each object here . There were a good two dozen people ranged about - grave courtiers , expensively appointed ladies with their maids and young daughters , quick-smiling lads in silken trunks and with curiously sheathed short swords - and though they made the noises a pleasant company makes , they now fell silent and looked upon Astolfo and me with undisguised curiosity . I felt as if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostess was no more than a thrice-widowed countess . So Astolfo had informed me . A countess then , yet she sat like a princess in her high-backed chair of stout oak with its carvings of gryphons and lion 's heads and fleurs-delis and with seat and back so sumptuously brocaded . There was no dais , but a respectful clear space surrounded this chair as the men and women kept their distance . They watched closely as we approached , as if they had gathered there for no purpose other than to observe Astolfo and me . We made proper obeisance and Astolfo addressed her in a confident , easy voice . " Milady Triana , we have come at your bidding . " " At my invitation , Master Astolfo . I have no power to order you about . " Was it the bulk of the chair that made her look so petite ? Though her face showed her to be a woman of handsome middle years , the way she was perched upon her seat caused her to appear no larger than a child . Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quavery , but with an uncertain timbre and a thinly veined crackle . Her hair was blonde streaked with white and when she moved her head it seemed to shimmer with a quick opalescence . Her eyes were not unfocused but fixed at a point somewhere between herself and the person whom she addressed , as if she looked inward more than outward . This gaze gave her a distracted air , though her words were clear enough . " We are honored by your kind invitation , " he replied and bowed again , pulling back his stiff linen cape with his left hand and sweeping the right before him like a violoncellist drawing his bow . " May I inquire into the health of your wife and children ? " the countess asked . " I have none , " Astolfo said . " As an unfortunate , I five alone with my mute manservant Mutano and with this man , Falco , " - he nudged and I bowed - " and with such house servants as I require . It is sometimes a cheerless existence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life has enabled you to gain the skills and arts you need in your cult of shadows . I have been informed that your craft requires constant and stringent application . " " I have labored in my discipline , but maybe to a quick-witted chap it would come more easily . " Now she said nothing for a moment and paused to take in the figure of my plumpish , balding master with his swift hands and his unaccustomed finery and the mild gray eyes that never threatened . It was evident to me that she already knew about Astolfo , and perhaps about me also , and that her questions had been put merely to give her time to form impressions . Yet I was a little surprised when she said , " I think that we have met aforetimes . " He paused before answering . " I believe we have not met before , milady . I am certain I would remember one so gracious and charming . " Her tone sharpened as suddenly as a gust of icy wind off a frozen lake . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . It is true that my mind is not so agile as formerly , nor so integral in its workings , yet I must recall Astolfo the thief who filched the shadow of the assassin Torrodo and delivered it to his mortal enemy to ravage at will . " " The stories of those days long past are more rumor than history , milady . " " " Twill do no good to set at me crosswise , " she said . " If I say we have met , we have met . If I say you have done such-and-such , you have done so . " And she drummed her heels under her broad skirt of figured white silk against the stretcher of her chair , as an impatient child might do . " Milady . " Astolfo bowed once more . " I do not much like shadows , " she declared . " Creeping , sneaking things they are . People say that you are a thief who steals shadows to sell for profit . I do not understand how anyone can steal a shadow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be stolen . There are thieves everywhere . I am continually missing rings and gold and silver bangles , tiaras , and suchlike . Some thieves are in this room now . " " Milady . " " Not you , Astolfo , but these others . Oh , I might tell you tales about this crowd that you would scarcely credit . Fine lot they are , very fine indeed . " Most of the assemblage must have heard her words , but none showed sign of response . They continued to amble about and chat together in muted voices . I received the impression that they were accustomed to the countess 's cross outbursts and took little account of them . " Perhaps there have been misunderstandings , " Astolfo said . " I am sure we are in gentle company here among these nobles . " " Never believe it , " she said . " Why do you insist on contradicting my observations ? Do you think me a fool ? " " Oh no , milady . Never . " " Sometimes I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud that comes into my head so that there are hours when I do not know who I am . I am not myself and I lose all placement in the world . That is when these betrayers take advantage , when they perceive I am not all that I need to be . " I looked the crowd over again , but they were as placid and unconcerned as before . " Why would anyone wish to purchase shadows from you ? Nasty , whispering , slithering things , always dogging one 's heels or leaning against the walls , wearing sullen faces , never a cheerful countenance among " em . Tell me why . " " Oh , " said Astolfo lightly , " I am often surprised by the various usages people put shadows to . Generally they are employed only to lend coolness or a certain kind of atmosphere to an area . They promote intimacy of discourse and soften the edges of social interchange . Harpists and lutenists may be hired to play softly at a gathering , furnishing a pleasant background ; shadows may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other uses . Perhaps you know that winemakers often steep wines in certain tints of shadow to gain subtlety and depth for vintages that lack sufficient character .... A thousand , thousand usages . Do you yourself not employ a coterie of shadows in the hallway leading to this grand salon ? I assume you had them placed there to unsettle visitors of unknown purpose , to serve to test those who come to visit you . " " I do not desire them . They have flocked to my walls unbidden . Unless - " She looked around at the company with bitter eyes and continued in a low , angry mutter , " - unless some of my betrayers have brought them in to do me evil . Since my mother died , I no longer can say who is my loyal friend and who my secret enemy . " " I am sorry to hear of your loss , " Astolfo said . " When did this happen ? " " It might have been yesterday . Or it might have been some years ago . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . " It might have been tomorrow . " " It is a sorrowful loss at any time . " She waved a graceful , brightly bejeweled hand at me . " Why does your young friend keep silent ? I am suspicious of those who stare and stare and say naught . " " Falco is newly from the farm , " Astolfo explained . " He is unfamiliar with polished society and fears to make a fool of himself . But as an aide to me , he does well enough . " " In your business with those shadows . " He smiled gently , nodded . " Well , it is about filthy shadows that I bade you come . " " I am honored by your kind invitation . " " Why must you continually abrade against me ? I say I bade you come at my deliberate insistence . I do not know you well enough to invite you . Few there are these days whom I invite . I can not easily trust anyone . " " You have no one you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a surprisingly sharp report . At once the murmuring of the company desisted . They all fell silent as an elderly man rose from where he sat on a curve-armed bench against the wall , walked slowly to a large table with a white runner-cloth , and lifted from it a small casket of embossed leather bound with iron straps . As he was bringing it to the Countess Trinia , she waved him aside toward Astolfo . " Please examine the jewel there , " she said . " I would know your thought of it . " He took the casket from the old gentleman and opened it to disclose , lying on plush purple velvet , a diamond that seemed as large as a crab apple . Though I stood some seven paces away , I could see what a brilliant light it gave off , how it gleamed with the candlelight . It was as if it captured the mellow flames and made them one within itself and then dispersed that glow in a thousand warm points throughout this broad salon . Astolfo looked at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countess , " Have I permission to take it in hand , milady ? " She assented . Between thumb and forefinger he held it before his eyes , peering closely . Then he wheeled slowly on his heel , bringing the stone round in a complete circle and turning it over and over to expose every surface . Polished but uncut , it throbbed as the torchlight and candlelight pierced its cool center . Then he laid it carefully back in place and bowed to the old courtier , who returned it to the long table . " Well , " said the countess , " what do you see there ? " " I am not certain , " Astolfo answered . " At first I thought I saw a flaw , but then it seemed more a smudge . Yet nothing mars the outer surface . Lf only I had brought hither my enlarging glass to examine it more closely . " " No , " she said , " no magical glasses . I do not trust them . What is to be seen must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see what I see . " " I saw a shadow . " " There ! " She clapped her hands again , startling me and all the company around . " I too saw the shadow , a horrid , dark , oozy , smoky thing wriggling in the very core of my stone . It was not there before . My diamond was formerly all clear , as bright and sharp in its glitter as starlight . Now it has gone golden , yellowish . I do not like that . Every day it loses value , does it not ? " " It is an immensely valuable stone , milady . " " No . I tell you it is forfeiting its worth to the hours that pass . Why will you always quarrel with me ? " " If it is not as bright as formerly , it may be damaged . But I do not know the cause . May I ask where it was found and how it came into your hands ? " " You may not . I am weary of debating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated the old man who had borne the jewel casket " - will give such history as you may need to know . My head hurts insufferably and my mind slips like a donkey on greasy cobblestones . I am done with this audience . When you find out the problem with my best diamond , when you have found a remedy for it , you must return and inform me and I shall reward you most generously . I do hope you will not quarrel with me about this commission I have laid upon you . I am sick of your controversies . " " Milady . " The old man came to us , bowed , and padded away to a door at the farther end of the salon , and we followed at a courteous distance . THIS SMALL ROOM off the main salon was quiet . A single bowl-shaded lamp on the table between four chairs in the center gave off a genial glow and Chrobius put the jewel casket beneath it . He wore a thin , silvery beard that came to a point below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle , weary-sounding , and he displayed the slender , ivory fingers of a patrician philosopher . He seated us and offered refreshment , which Astolfo , and I , following his example , declined . Then Chrobius sat in the chair between us and told us that almost nothing was known of the provenance of this diamond that so exercised the countess . " How now ? " Astolfo asked . " So handsome a jewel must have a voluminous history . " " Perhaps so , but it will be a history of which we are ignorant . " Chrobius 's voice was extraordinarily calm , almost hypnotic in its measured cadences . " It was discovered among the effects of the countess 's second husband , Tyrin Blanzo . The Blanzi were a family of merchants quite powerful at one time but latterly fallen upon scanty luck . Like many another trading company , they had ventured ships into the perilous seas northward , hoping for trade among the woodland tribes of Justerland and with the fisher folk of the Aurora Isles . But tempest and piracy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading enterprises , and nowadays their finances rested upon the rents of their estates . It had been supposed by some that this diamond was derived from the profits of trade , but no record of its provenance was extant . " " How long after the death of Blanzo before its discovery ? " Astolfo asked . " A good two years , " Chrobius replied . " The countess had already remarried and thought that for economy purposes she ought to try to make an inventory of her late husband 's possessions . In going through one of his sea chests , she found the casket with the jewel . " " Was it , upon discovery , in the same condition as now ? " " I am unconversant in the lore of stones , but meseemeth it has changed since that time . Perhaps it has dulled somewhat . The countess says it has " goldered7 and that seems as apt a term as may be . " " And the countess herself ? Has she changed since the advent of this diamond ? " He hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She herself speaks of certain misapprehensions to which she is prey . You heard her say so . Whether this jewel has connection to that , I can not say . It appears very unlike , but it was at that time she began to complain . Some who have known her claim to have noticed a change , but she was always something bewildered in the world . " " Are there those who wish her harm ? " " You see our little universe here , so like a court of rural royalty . There is hardly anyone who is not wished some degree of harm by another . The countess is subject to arbitrary humors and peremptory demands , some say . Injured feelings follow in her train . " " Have you ever felt the brunt of her impulsiveness ? " Astolfo asked . " Not I , no . But it is well known that all women are prey to changeable moods . Her position is precarious and demands perhaps more will-call than she may possess . " " You use an odd term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am unfamiliar with it . " Chrobius smiled in the manner of an indulgent schoolmaster . " It would occur but rarely in your kind of business , I think . It is a philosophic term , meaning something like " fortitude " or " martial spirit . " Perhaps " manliness " comes closest to its meaning . " " Would anyone design the countess bodily harm ? Would anyone be bold to take her life ? " He rubbed the point of his beard with thumb and forefinger as if feeling the texture of cloth . " I do not know . I should think it not likely . Her last husband , the third , that count of some vague area he called Ondormo , was a dark and bitter man who never showed real love for her . But he has been banished by the countess and lives in exile . " " So she is not thrice widowed . " " She accounts him as dead . " " Where might he inhabit ? " " Again , I do not know . Some have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he coils within one of them like an adder in its hole . There are other rumors also . " " What were the points of contention ? " " There are rumors only , something about the division of a property . But I credit none of it . He was headstrong , willful , arrogant , - she is , as you see , sometimes distracted and of sudden waywardness . There may have been little other than a conflict of wills . " Astolfo took up the diamond and held it against the lamplight , turning it carefully . " I regret that she will not allow close inspection with a jeweler 's glass , " he murmured . Chrobius smiled slowly . " As to that - " he said , and produced from a sleeve pocket a silver loupe , intricately enchased . " I can see no harm in your looking at it and can not say why she objects . Probably it is no more than one of her personal superstitions . In these bad days , she lacks all proper and confident will-call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took for granted that the shadow master was expert in the knowledge of precious stones , as he is in so many other matters . But as he studied the object , bringing it closer to the lamp and withdrawing it , revolving it over and over , his expression troubled into perplexity and he began to hum to himself singsong , a sign that he had struck upon a puzzle . Finally he laid it back , almost reverently , upon the casket plush . " It would be shameful if such a prize should be an instrument of harm , " he said . " Do you think that it is ? " I asked . Instead of answering my query , he transferred it to Chrobius . " You , sir , do you believe that it is ? " The old gentleman gave his beard a short tug . " Today all my replies are but professions of ignorance , " he said . " I do not know . " " Falco and I must consult our sources , " Astolfo said . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folios . If you will guide us , Chrobius , back to the corridor of whispering shadows , we can find our way from there . " " No need for that nuisance , " he replied . " There is another way , speedier and more pleasant , to the entrance . " " Thank you for your kindness , " Astolfo said . " Yet even so , we should like to retrace our steps . Those shadows seem to have secrets they desire to share . " " I think you can gain but little from them , but I shall be glad to accoiiipany you the way you came . " He set off slowly , then paced lightly through the salon . The countess was absent and her tall , throne-like chair had been set against the wall . A few gabbling late-stayers stood about and seemed to take no notice of our passage . At the door to the corridor Chrobius made a final bow and bade us farewell . My mount at this period was a dapple gray cob of complaisant temper . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Torta , she was called - from Astolfo 's stable and handed the mare to me with that fleering sardonic smile that meant he had picked out an easy mount because he considered it best suited to my abilities . As to that , he was mistaken , but I accepted the reins in good grace and resolved to take excellent care of the animal . I could see that Torta had her points : not fleet but powerful and of steady courage . She would not flee a set-to . Astolfo had turned off on the way back to his mansion with a salute signifying he would return in a short time . I could see he was headed into Tardocco , but what his errand might be I could not know . It was late afternoon and the sun was just at the roof edges of this busy port city , now settling out of its workaday bustle , readying for the pleasures of twilight and early evening . I stabled Torta and looked well to her , then went for a stroll about the grounds . Early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare flowering shrubs Astolfo was partial to . It occurred to me that he might have gone to consult one of his friends , an astute jeweler probably , in the town , and I thought I might gain a little credit with him by some quick study . I went into the mansion , into the great library , and strolled to the area where the volumes on stones were kept . By this time , I had achieved some familiarity with this extensive collection of books and manuscripts , though I knew Astolfo would not agree . He held me as being only a little more learned than a runt beagle . It had been a long three seasons since I broke into this house , hoping to be apprehended as a thief and then taken in as the shadow master 's apprentice . My wish had come true - and had brought more burthen than I had bargained for . Yet I knew enough about the subject of stones to begin by looking into a late edition of the Grand Albertus and to follow its hints into Rhodius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lux opali et caibunculi . It was in these latter pages that I came upon the story of the lady Erminia . This antique baroness always wore a dazzling opal in her hair . The resplendently milky stone closely matched the character of its mysterious owner , sparkling brightly when her mood was lightest , spitting out red gleams when she angered , clouding like a wheel-parted lane puddle when she wept . When in her later years her heart was broken by a perfidious lover , the opal cracked into five pieces , spilling its various , shattered colors upon the air and extorting from the miserable lady her dying breath . When her spirit passed from her , the five fragments of the stone crumbled to a dull gray powder , as did the shrunken form of Erminia herself . I wondered if the story of this opal might suggest fruitful application to the case of our countess and when I mentioned the possibility to Astolfo he did not instantly reject it . He professed surprise at finding me searching in the library when he arrived from the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complicated and uncertain matter . " Superstition collects about expensive gems as thick as rumors around a beautiful woman , " he said . " And , as with the woman , the more pure and powerful the virtues , the darker are the conjectures that swarm . The brightest and clearest diamond will be accounted the most perilous to its owner . " " How does that come about ? " I asked . " Partly because of envy , " he said . " If you have not the means nor the good luck to possess the fine sapphire that I possess , thou'lt impute every sort of dire quality to it and find ready belief among your rabble friends . " " But is none of the hearsay true ? Ominous tales about jewels are as thick as the winter fur of an Aurora wolf . " " Some knowledge is certain . I for one would not wear a black pearl , " Astolfo said . " And I would not allow a mumbling priest with his ill-smelling censer and his murky sprinklings to come within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . But " ware you of anyone who says that a sard has been tainted by the poison of a dragon who guarded it in his hoard . " " Are there any so gullible as to believe ? " " There is many a merchant sharp-eyed in accounting , in the surveying of lands , in the lading of ships , in the interest rates of lending who will lose all compass when he come to the subject of gems . Those little bits of gleam seem to have been created to drive men 's wits astray . This is another quality they share with women . " " Is not the countess right to be concerned ? Her diamond seems of no steadfast state . It is changing from its former being , is it not ? " " ' Twouldseem so . But what have you observed about the lady ? We had but short time in her company , yet I found her a striking figure . " " She is a conundrum , " I said . " I could not even judge her age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The flicker of torches and candles made observation difficult , but I thought she possessed a double shadow . " " Two primaries , you mean - apart from all the penumbrae caused by multiple light . " " Two shadows that she would possess in any place . " " How would you describe them ? " " Both were small , " I said . " One was a playful , gray shade , lively in motion , with flirting , fluttering outlines . The other was of a cast much darker , its shape somewhat crooked , its edges crabbed and ragged . It was bent in upon itself , reclusive , whereas the first shadow was an outgoing thing , ready to engage with any surface or any slant of light . " " Which of the two would you say matched the countess herself in body and in spirit ? " I hesitated . " Neither of them . Perhaps both together in some way I can not explain . Yet not the both of them at once connect well to her . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it from where I stood . Its size is its salience . " T would be shameful if it is damaged , for a jewel of that size , if it be perfect , might bring a small kingdom as its price . " " And the velvet ? " " Velvet ? " " It was perched upon the casket 's purple cushion . What did you see there ? " Long I thought . " There was a little space where the nap was depressed , just next the diamond . " " Good . " Astolfo nodded . " Perhaps this estimable gem had a companion in the casket . " " Do you think the diamond might possess some spiritual bond with the countess ? " I asked . " For I have read how a certain lady Erminia was so closely soul-yoked with an opal that - " " Enough of that old tale , " Astolfo said . " It is as moldy as a cave for cheeses . " " Is it not true ? " " Even a truth , if too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that instance carries us too far from our present one . We must keep close our attentions upon the countess . What kind of person will cast two primary shadows ? " This was a question familiar to apprentices . " One whose twin died at birth . Or one who has been loved , adored beyond all reason , by someone who lies in the grave . Or someone whose mind is distracted , split into two minds , so that the man or woman is split into two . Or a mother or father who early lost two dear children . Or - " " Good enough , " he said and gave me a square look . " You are not the blockhead you once were . Now tell me , what manner of person will cast three shadows ? " " I am not certain . I have heard it said that priests who serve three gods or a triple god in one may drop three umbrae , but I have no real knowledge of this . " " Sometimes there are born , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three others , being themselves but vessels . They will be shadowed triply , but none of the shades belongs to them personally and are but evidences of these entities that inhabit them . Among women , however , there occur figures who are themselves three in one and embody the three great powers of womanhood : the capricious candor of the child , the copious beauty of the adult , and the age-wise , humorous , secret lore of the crone . These triple figures are rare in the world and much revered by members of the female gender when recognized . I believe the Countess Trinia to be such a person . As such , she will be a remarkable , strong leader of her people , if she is not attacked in some fashion . " " She is a beautiful woman , " I said , " and it is easy to find in her much of the child , the spoiled brat . But I saw no trace of the crone about her . And I saw only two shadows . " " She complains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with herself as formerly she was . " " If she lost one of her shadows , that might mean that one-third of her self was missing . " " Lost ? Stolen ? " " I can not say . " " I will suspect theft , " Astolfo declared . " Chrobius has warned us that there is something not right about the little " universe , " as he called it , of her great hall . We need to pursue further . I am particularly interested in that diamond that was shown us . We must examine it at leisure , with our library of jewel lore and history at hand . " " How is that possible ? " " You will have to steal it , " Astolfo said . " But only as a temporary condition . Being honest gentles , we would never plan to keep it . " " Steal it ? I ? I could never - " " Are you eager to learn the art of shadows or not ? This is but a simple early step . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart lurched within me like a young horse balking at a leap . I HAD MADE no long-drawn objections to Astolfo 's statement that I was to purloin the diamond from the countess . He and his manservant Mutano , who was my constant and ever vigilant drillmaster , would surely spend some weeks educating and training me for this nocturnal exercise . So I thought , but once again I had failed to apprehend the design . The theft was to take place on the second night from today - or rather , in the second morning , for I was to enter the grounds of the countess 's petite palace two hours before daybreak and to make my departure just as the earliest dawn-fight brushed the rambling brick walls surrounding the edifice . " We must be brisk about this business , " Astolfo said , " for I believe that the countess stands in danger to herself and to the little realm that is loyal to her . The task is not so difficult as it may seem . This is no iron fortress high-perched upon some vulturous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridors , many adits and exits . Formerly it was a religious institution with the great salon as its principal place of worship and the outlying rooms and buildings serving as quarters for the clerics and devotees . " T was never constructed to keep out intruders , expert or clumsy . Mutano will attempt to subtract some of your natural clumsiness , but it is unnecessary for you to gain the handiness of an experienced burglar . The place is not well guarded . The wealth of the countess is comparatively small - though I would not say meager - and her palace holds no strategic military position . " " What if I am apprehended ? " " ' T would be a sour business , " he replied , " for you will be recognized and the surmise shall be that you have come for the diamond . " " As will be the case . " " And so they will attempt to discover if you have entered there at my order and whether I am involved in some intrigue against the countess . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you came to thieve out of your own cupidity and that you have betrayed my trust in you and that I will be in a fury against you when I find out . " " Will they be satisfied ? " " After some hours of torture , you would undoubtedly reveal all . " " I do not savor this experiment . " " Mutano will supply you with a delightful drug . The first moment you are threatened with torture , you have only to swallow this bolus to die a swift and rapturous death . " His gray-eyed gaze never clouded its mild steadiness . When I looked at Mutano , he gave me a broad smile and held up a little sphericle , as carmine in color as the seed of the pomegranate . " Very well , " I said . Since the enclosing walls were of brick and attained to a height of no more than half again my own , my scaling apparatus consisted of a fight horsehair rope equipped with a small , three-pronged hook of iron . Only the claw-ends were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft leather to deaden its sound against the brick . My weapons were to be a short sword with a blade three hands in length , a poniard to tuck into the breast of my chamois doublet , and a short-steeled dirk hidden in my left boot . " This is feeble armory , " I complained . " If I am caught , there will be more than one to come against me . " " If you bear more weaponry , you shall go clacking about like a pelican , " Astolfo said . " Your only real advantage is a stealth that more blades would but diminish . Graceful stealth , that is your only method . And for that , you shall have the concealment of a shadow . " " Truly ? " I was enheartened by the prospect . Astolfo had not yet trusted me to wear a shadow . I was too fumble-footed , he said , too cockyjerky in my movements . The sturdiest shadow he drew about me would soon disintegrate to tatters and giblets , lose all its dark luster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was to don one and I began to think that this was a real engagement , after all , and not a mere exercise drill to sharpen my skills and broaden my education . Of course , that would mean that the scarlet suicide dosage was a real and earnest poison and that the prospect of torture was not a figment of fancy . I began to have a creeping uneasiness of mind , but there was no turning back . I had given my Yea and could never live down changing to Nay or shill-I-shall-I . One sandglass before daybreak was my time to enter the palace compound . " Late-reveling courtiers do not rise at cockcrow , " Astolfo explained , " and so there will be early light , fore-dawning and then dawn . A black shadow would be as noticeable as a camelopard and a gray one as visible as mist . So we must resort to the colors , Mutano . What tints should we drape about our daybreak thief ? " Mutano replied with a swift twittering of his fingers . I had puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mute manservant conversed and had learned that they communicated in at least three different gestural dialects . What they were signaling now I could not fathom . Astolfo smiled humorously and told me that Mutano thought I should have choice of colors since I was to be the wearer . " What then do you choose ? " The study of shadow color is long and intricate and I had but barely touched upon it in my reading . Since whatever tints I named would be declared mistaken , I made the obvious choices . " If the day is to be fair and bright , the early light will be purple changing to yellow and silver , " I said . " Perhaps a dun color might pass without note . " As I expected , my colleagues grinned at my blunder . " Well then , Falco , " Astolfo said , " it is time for a hasty lesson in the hues of shadows . " He signed to Mutano to draw the curtains of the tall library windows so that we were left in a dimness close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp sitting upon the smaller table , lit the wick with a single striking of flint , and set a concave , brightly polished mirror behind the lamp . He motioned me to step close to the table and when I did he laid flat upon it a blank sheet of snowy paper . " How many kinds of primary light have we in the room ? " he asked . " Two , " I replied . " A strong white one from the mirrored lamp and a duller , softer one that seeps through the linen curtains . " " Very well . Now observe the shadow upon this paper . What do you see ? " He took up a small dagger from the tabletop , customarily kept there to break the seals of documents , and stood it perpendicular to the surface with his fingertip . " I see two shadows . The one produced by the lamp is bluish ; the other , a dusty yellow , comes from the window light . " " That is what you believe you see , " Astolfo said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drapes over the curtains . " What do you see now ? " " The blue shadow made by the lamp glare has turned black . " " And the edges ? " " They were a little indistinct before . Now they are sharp . " He nodded and Mutano opened the drapes . Astolfo doused the mirrored lamp . " The dagger shadow now ? " " It is a thin , gray wash , dim . A common shadow , I should call it . " " There are no common shadows - you have been taught this lesson many times . The lamplight and the curtained light are complementary and result in a falsity of vision . Your eyes deceive you because of this commixture of lights . When you are at your business in the palace of the countess , there will be two kinds of light . The early fight of the east will commingle with the retreating darkness of the rest of the sky , a dark gray tending to mauve . The shadow you wear must be of a complementary color that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - but only deceptive to it . " " What color , then ? " " I put it to you . " " I can do no better than the evidence of my senses , deceived though they may be , " I said . " This mild blue is complementary , is it not ? " " It is one of the complementarles , but do not forget that as the hour wears , the light will change in intensity and hue . " " So then- ? " " We shall have a parti-colored shade of several tints , " Astolfo said . " They shall flow in and out of one another like the shades in a rainbow where a waterfall pours into the pool of a forest stream . In this wise , you may go from place to place and seem to be only a part of the natural changes of morning . " It did not sound plausible . " But will not so many colors present a garish , anomalous sight in a peaceful dawning ? " " Do you trust already the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose I must not . From what personage did you gain this shadow of many colors ? " " From the renowned actor Ortinio . A man who has portrayed many characters with true and convincing manner will have a various and variable shadow . But this particular shadow lacketh strong texture . It is a consequence of the actors " trade that they have but pallid personalities themselves and must rely upon the playwright to supply them with character . The shadow must be supported by an undergarment . You shall wear a many-colored tunic of several fight fabrics to help to sustain the delusion . The correct stratagem with colored shadows is to cause men to see what they already believe they see . " " Very well . How am I to enter the grounds of the palace ? " He laid down the dagger , took up a stick of sharpened charcoal , and began sketching a series of boxes upon the paper . " Here is a rough plan of the palace and the grounds . How shall you proceed ? Where do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the stone is kept , " I said . " Best to come as close as possible to that place unless it be heavily guarded and most closely watched . If it be so , then better to enter at a more distant point and make way to it by degrees . " Mutano and Astolfo traded gazes , nodding in agreement . " And where will the diamond lie ? " Astolfo asked . " I can not say . I think the countess would want it close by her , but now she has begun to mistrust her faculties . Perhaps she entrusts to Chrobius or another counselor for its safety . Perhaps it is in a separate room by itself under armed guard . " " Will you then steal into three places at once ? " " Time is lacking . On three succeeding nights I might do so , but the choice to begin with is easy . I would try the room set apart for it is where I would have less chance of being recognized . " Again the pair nodded agreement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Astolfo pushed the paper toward me . His sketch showed a long north-south rectangle with the large palace building against the east wall , flanked on both sides by a dozen adjoining boxes . In the middle of the whole he had drawn a box divided into two and this I took to be an armory and barracks for the guards . He had not drawn entrances there , but I supposed it to have four , faced in opposite directions . " Here . " I touched the third box on the left of the main palace . " I can go over the wall , onto the roof , and then along to the left . " " Well enough , " he said . " I believe that to be a sort of dormitory for the bachelor courtiers . I picture them sleeping in their cots , giving off winefumy snores , as you tiptoe cat-like above them . Only look below when you come to the corner and begin your descent , to make certain that guards are not hiding out of sight in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall be wary . " But his warning was a prediction . The night passed slowly and as soon as I had made my cautious , finger-straining descent of the terra-cotta drainpipe and the corner of the building , eight burly guardsmen appeared as if summoned by a silent bell . Beyond them a group of twenty or so stood in close order in the great courtyard . Six of the eight ringed me with drawn blades while a seventh sprang to pin my arms behind my back . The eighth , a villainous , scar-faced captain every bit as large as Mutano , searched me over efficiently , tossing away my short sword and dagger and fishing from my boot the favorite little dirk I had thought so cleverly hidden . " Your name ? " he asked in a voice that was accustomed to transmuting the blood of new recruits to cold cat piss . " Tombolo , " I said , naming the neighbor farm boy who had tormented my earliest years with bullying . " Doubtful , " he grunted . " Your occupation ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful , " he growled and his ugly brothers-in-arms seconded his statement with derisive giggles . " How came you here ? " " I say no more . Do your worst . " " So we may - and without your . permission . But please , I entreat you , answer one thing more . Why do you come clothed in this ridiculous , gaudy motley ? A man , be he thief or sea cook , will be seen in it seven leagues off . " I looked down at myself and was astonished . No subtle shadow of slowly shifting tints and flamy shapes enwrapped my shoulders , torso , and arms . Instead , I wore a filmy , light mantle or robe of ungainly cut all pieced together of vivid ribbons , with colors of lime , scarlet , azure , emerald , ember-gray , and inky purple . Now that I saw it I could feel its weight upon me , slight but palpable . " See his face , " crowed my chief captor . " His mouth hangs slack like a gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Should not the countess take him just as he stands for her court jester ? - But hold . He is too tall for the office of jester . We must subtract an ell or so . " He drew his sword and came close . " Where shall we lessen you , Sir Fool ? Shall we take from the bottom ? " He thwacked me across the knees with the flat of his blade . " From the top ? " He scratched a filthy thumbnail across the knob of my throat . " Or from the middle ? " He traced the sword tip across my chest , tearing open the flimsy contraption of ribbons . All his smug japeries brought forth unbounded hilarity from his whiskery , overfed troop , and I vowed that if ever I enlisted in a guard troop , I would choose one whose leader did not fancy himself a humorist . But at this moment I was so abashed by my capture and , more , by my ribbony motley , that I could form no response but to repeat my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our worst ? " he said and laughed a gravelly long minute . " Sir Fool , you would not beg for the worst if you could conceive what it might be . " A voice , cheerful , familiar , mild but incisive , came from behind the ring of soldiers : " The worst is mine . " With this sentence , the troop parted ranks and Astolfo came ambling toward me . He was dressed in his military best , a sea-colored caftan belted with a broad sash of cloth-of-gold , a short-sleeved red cloak , a tall , broadbrimmed hat with a white plume . A sword hung from his left shoulder in a brightly jeweled sheath and he bore a tall lance in his left hand . He came directly to me and said again , " The worst is mine , " and with that he balled his right hand and delivered me such a blow to the neck that I fell backward on the ground and the dawning sky , the roof of the building , and the faces of Astolfo and the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth of a drain . I tried to speak , but the blow to my neck , just there at the base of my throat , had made words impossible . I could not cough or croak and heaved for breath like a fresh-landed carp . " Stand him up , " Astolfo commanded , and when the captain gestured , two obscenely grinning troopers jerked me to my feet . If they had not gripped me on both sides by elbow and shoulder , I surely would have toppled again . Astolfo strode round in a circle , striking the ground with the butt of his steel-tipped lance and seeming to be in deep and furious thought . Finally he halted and addressed the guards at large : " Gentlemen ! Behold the spectacle that treacherous ingratitude and sneaking rebellion may make of a man . This Falco , when I first took him into my employ , was but an unlettered , unmannered peasant boy still aromatic from dunging the stony fields of his father . Like many another of elder years , I trusted his innocence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my table . His only duties were to better himself with study and to perform some fight labors under the guidance of my faithful manservant . " He ground the lance butt into the dust and paused . " But see him now . He has wantonly entered your palace compound , intent on I know not how many villainies . He came armed and that is always a proof of evil purpose . He has clothed himself in this tatterdemalion ragtaggery for no reason I can put name to . This outfit belonged to my young sister who wore it to Midsummer Eve festivals when she was a child of twelve years or so . Perhaps he thought " t would serve to excuse him as a madman if captured rather than the perfect natural he proves to be . " The soldiers laughed with hearty appreciation and Astolfo came to stand before me again . " It was a happy accident that led me to discover , by means of certain papers I found in his quarters , that he planned to come here tonight and steal what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide them away in my house and one night before the last quarter of the moon he would slit my throat as I lay sleeping , ransack my meager belongings , and join with the infamous pirate Morbruzzo to plunder all the city of Tardocco , murdering and burning . " He lifted the butt of the lance and thrust it heavily into my belly . My knees went water ; my gut surged with pain . " As soon as I found these darksome , infernal papers , I hurried here to warn your good minister Chrobius of Falco 's miscreant plans . That is why you were all turned out for the successful capture . The countess will be pleased with your dutiful performance . " He turned his back upon me and lifted his voice which , though still mild in tone , carried with powerful strength . " Look upon him and " ware you , " he declaimed . " See what the low taverns and fleshpots of the town have wrought upon a young lad too simple to withstand the easiest temptations , too weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take stock of his own character and come to proper discipline . Your wise Chrobius proposed that we hang him from the scaffold yonder at the far corner of the wall , but I have persuaded him that certain interrogations must first proceed , for we know not what other designs he hath formed nor which confederates might be leagued with him . We shall lead him back to my house , gentlemen , and put questions to him in such manner that he shall plead with tearful eyes and broken bones to be hanged with all dispatch . Your good captain has offered a detail of men to guard us homeward and I have gratefully accepted . " With this sentence two men fell into rank on either side of me while Astolfo and a shaggy corporal posted themselves before . Then we were off on a dolorously sluggish march out of the compound while the soldiers rattled their weapons in derision . Through the gates we went , over the road through the fields and into Tardocco . The pace became a little brisker yet was slow enough that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night watch returning sleepily homeward , the ostlers and sweepers and blear-eyed , unsteady revelers in their rounds - had a good long view of the sorry spectacle of dejected Falco trudging through the streets in soiled and bedraggled motley . When we reached Astolf o 's mansion he unlocked the gate to the east garden and led us to the springhouse there under the great hemlock tree . Into that cold , dank space he booted me , wrapped a chain around door-slat and jamb , and secured it with a massive lock . " There he 'll cool his senses , gentlemen , and my manservant will come out shortly to keep guard over him . Meantime , let us go into the house and try what the larder might supply to break our fast . I seem to recall a platter of kidney pies and a small keg of new country oat ale . " They responded to this invitation with ready good cheer and marched off , Astolfo leading them while whistling a merry martial tune . I heard him say , as they departed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your generous countess and the sage Chrobius do not reward us royally for this morning 's labor . " I sat down weakly on the stone ledge of the spring run , where jugs of fresh milk , oilskin packets of cheese and butter , and jars of wine were set to cool . As I was rubbing my tender belly and nursing my throbbing noggin , my eye fell upon a basket of woven willow in the corner by my left boot . I dragged it open to discover a pewter mug , a loaf of black bread , a knuckle of boiled beef , and some table cutlery . I had understood , from the first moment of Astolfo 's appearance , that my attempted burglary was but a staged mummery , a stratagem designed to force attention upon myself and away from some other occurrence , but I could not fathom what it might be . For the time being , I did not care . Despite my knocks and aches , I was perishingly hungry and fell upon the victuals like a gryphon tearing asunder an ox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones of this springhouse might serve as a bed . I was much a-weary and though food had restored my spirits a little , my pains did not desist . The little players " scene before the soldiery was but sham , yet Astolfo 's blows had been sufficiently genuine . THE STONES MADE no easy pallet , but they must have afforded some portion of comfort , for I had to be awakened by Mutano 's kicking my boot sole . When I opened my eyes I was startled ; I knew the dumb man to be of goodly proportion but had become accustomed . Now that I looked up at him as I lay prone he seemed as tall and maybe as solid as an astrologer 's tower . I rose shakily and with much groaning and followed him through the full morning fight into the kitchen of the great house . Astolfo was there , seated , according to his wont , on the large butcher block in the center . He swung his legs idly and hailed me as we entered : " How now , brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is't not a jolly existence , rife with surprise and unlooked-for reward ? Have you already determined to follow its ways to riches - or to the gallows ? " If I showed ill temper , his gibing would only sharpen . " When I take up thievery , " I said , " I shall make certain that my colleagues are trustworthy and will not betray me at whim . " " Come , lad . Do you truly find me a whimsical man ? " " I must suppose that my embarrassment and painful blows were parts of a design you had in hand . I have no doubt you will name them the necessary parts . " " We had to convince a skeptical guard troop and the canny Chrobius , " he replied . " You may be assured that he was watching our playlet from a high window , trying to discover any trace of deception . " I rubbed my rueful ribs tenderly . " He shall have been convinced , " I asserted . " And I am curious to know what Mutano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own wretched plight . When did you cloak me in this stupid ribbon-dress ? When I set out in the fore-dawn , methought I wore a shadow of subtle tints and colorations invisible in dawnlight . " " And so you did , " Astolfo explained . " This frock of giblets and flinders , which no sister of mine could ever wear , if ever I had a sister , served as undergarment to the shadow we cast over you at the last . But that shadow possessed some of its rainbow qualities because its genesis was in moisture . " T was the shadow of the actor Ortinio standing in mist with the fight bright behind him . As you went along , throwing off animal heat from your exertions , and as the morning grew warmer , this mist-shadow dissipated , leaving you all checkered in parti-colored motley . " " I hope you are content with the spectacle I made , for I think it could not have been completer . " " Let us see how content we are to be , for I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mutano , who nodded and with a grave smile unlaced a white leather pouch from his belt , fingered open its mouth , and poured into his left palm four small stones . I recognized them as black opals , ominous gems of grim reputation . They are warranted to bring ill fortune o anyone who possesses them . Astolfo counted them over : " Here is the sphericle ; here the mandorla ; here the small lozenge , - here the larger cartouche . " He pointed out each shape as he went , then looked at Mutano . " It is the tiny arrow-leaf opal , then ? " Mutano smiled more widely and from the cuff of his ocher leather sleeve plucked forth another opal , even blacker than the others , which had been cut at one end into a sharpish point . Astolfo clapped his hands lightly , then rubbed them together . " So our surmise was correct . The piercing form had been chosen , though there is but superstition in the choice and no science . " I began . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ridiculous , " Astolfo said and reached out casually and ripped away my robe of ribbons , crushed it into a ball , and flung it on the flagstone floor . " You will learn more thoroughly without reliving your embarrassment . Let us sip a mug of ale to help wash down the dusty matter of explanation . " He dropped lightly to the floor , rummaged three mugs from a cupboard , and poured them foaming from a stout stone jar . He , and then Mutano and I , raised our mugs in salute and tasted the brew . Such an ale would cheer even the glummest hour . " Do you remember when Chrobius showed us the diamond and the things he said of the countess ? " " He lauded her generosity , " I answered , " but lamented the late infirmity of her mind . " " Good . And do you remember how he termed this infirmity ? " " He said that she began to lack sufficient and proper will-call . " " Yes . Will-call . In your wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have you ever encountered this odd word ? " Something nibbled at the rearward of my memory like a mouse in the corner of a meal bin . " Is there not a school or maybe a cabal of philosophers who have formulated certain notions about the nature of authority , about who should be allowed to rule , and how succession of princes , counts , and other nobility should be arranged and that - that .... " The fusty wormeaten manuscript treatise began to crumble in my mind-sight . " Perhaps " twill aid your recollection to note that this gabble of thinkers is sometimes denominated by their deridere as the Prickalists or Pricktolites . " " The Masculinists , " I said . " Yes , they who believe that it is graven by the stars upon the tablets of fate that only men are to bear sway over other men and over women . That , they believe , is the true and proper order of things . Any female who occupies a throne or any seat of power is reenacting some ancient and illicit act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of degraded confusion . " " Now you have got it , " Astolfo said . " Those who follow this course of thought will not allow that it is legitimate for a woman to rule or to have power over any others , excepting her children , her animals , and her female servants . " " So , if Chrobius subscribes to this way of thinking - " " He may desire to overthrow any woman in a seat of state . Yet what sort of woman , what exemplar of the female mind , will he distrust , fear , and perhaps envy the most ? " " The woman who is three in one , " I said , " the triply endowed , triply powerful woman who is child , beauty , and crone in one . " The thought of it fired my enthusiasm so that I drained off my mug and held it out to be replenished . He pretended to demur . " We are not to the end of this knotty length of string . You had better keep your wits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in fee to me for another ale and many another after that , " I said , " because of the ugly drubbing you laid upon me at the palace . " He grinned and Mutano poured me full again . " But I can not cipher how Mutano 's stealing of that small black-opal arrow can hinder the schemes of Chrobius . " " He did not steal , - he traded for it , " Astolfo said . " You have studied the lore of precious stones . You have read how jewels , and diamonds in particular , partake or share , after being long in their possession , the spirits of their owners . " " Yes . I recalled to you the instance of Erminia , whose jewel crumbled when she died , but you dismissed the tale . " " ' T is worn thin from too much wear , but true enough . I have no quarrel with its kernel . Now you must have read also that the nature of one stone can be transformed by keeping it in proximity with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " In Maxilius " De gemmae et spinti mundi , there is a lengthy - " " Yes , and in Bertralius , Ronio , Militides , and many another . Chrobius had paired the countess 's diamond with a pernicious opal while the casket stood nighttimes in her bedchamber . By little and little , it drew one part of her tripartite spirit into the diamond , the opal serving as conduit . In due season , the other sides of her nature would also follow and the diamond itself would cloud to dull gray and finally to black . She herself would be left a husk , without memory , without spark , - she would lapse Lifeless in her mind , her body deteriorating like a drift of snow melting in the first heats of springtime . " " And Chrobius would then seize her state . " " No , he hath no lineage of blood . The people would not countenance the usurpation . But her third husband , the count with whom he is joined , would return from exile , pretend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all power to himself . " " This diamond found in the sea chest , this legacy of her second husband , has not proved the happy largess she thought it . " " It was no legacy . Chrobius or some accomplice secreted it there to be found . " " But why does Mutano hold not one but five black opals ? " " We did not know the design of the one Chrobius paired with the diamond and were forced to resort to surmise , choosing the most favored designs in which that gem is usually cut . Fortune was with us . " " But now Chrobius will see his opal absent , will think upon my stupid burglary attempt and its childish comedy , and know that you - " " He will not find the opal missing , for Mutano substituted a harmless bit of obsidian in that same shape to fie in the casket by the diamond . It hath no occult powers and in time the countess 's spirit shall escape its diamond imprisonment and she shall be three again and whole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewal , and know - " " He will know that we know his scheme and that if he move against her we can reveal all upon him . " " Why not do so at once ? " " Best to watch and wait . Has he confederates in the palace ? Has he formed secret alliances with other princes , other provinces or forces ? He shall be aware of our gaze and if he does attempt any hidden plan , we shall detect it forthwith . " " So we do nothing for the present . " " We watch and wait . You may improve the time by further study of gems , and Mutano will begin your preparation for exercises in the wearing of shadows , how to don them without causing damage , how to choose the best for the task at hand , how to fit them to your form , how to move in them so that you seem a play of light and dark and not a clown clopping through a murky fog . " " This is a more entertaining exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " There may be enjoyment in it . " " As may be , " said Astolfo , " yet this too is a discipline requiring rigor . And has Mutano ever disappointed you in the policy of rigor ? " I looked at Mutano 's broad smile and did not altogether like the cast of it . " No , " I said , " he has not . " We had arranged for the unmasking of Chrobius to take place in three stages in our next and final visitation at the court . The first stage was for me to be brought before the countess in chains and shackles , bearing the marks of ungentle treatment ; I was to make confession of my fictitious dastardly crimes and she was to conceive and pronounce sentence . This bit of prelude was to afford us opportunity to observe the countess , to see whether or not we could discover changes in her demeanor , in the movements of her mind , the health of her physic . We were to observe Chrobius also for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduit opal with an innocuous shard of obsidian-or for any change about the minister that might betoken danger to the countess or to us . Our audience with her this time proceeded in the beginning similarly to the first time . We were received , as then , before her imposing , elaborately carved chair in the large salon . Now Mutano was present as guard over me and he found it his part in the acting to cuff me about the jaw from time to time and to give my ankles an occasional contemptuous kick . This part he played with unfeigned relish . I stood before the countess , Mutano on my right side , Astolfo on the other , and Chrobius off to the left behind us , - 1 mumbled out the rigmarole Astolfo had rehearsed me in : how I had planned to steal the great diamond , keep it secret till I could use it to buy my way into the good graces of the bloody pirate Morbruzzo , then join with him in a campaign of pillage , rapine , and destruction . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimen of iron disciplines , I had become a miserable and sniveling penitent and content to live or die in any fashion at the countess 's desire . She spoke to Astolfo . " What think you , sir ? Is his penitence genuine or only a further sham with which he hopes to escape the severest sentence ? " He inclined his head , an ambiguous expression on his face . " I believe he is sincere at this moment , in this hour today . But who can read what thought will come tomorrow to such a viper's-knot of a mind ? " " You have him securely in hand ? " " Oh yes , milady . My man Mutano looks to him closely . " At these words , Mutano fetched me such a sharp slap that blood dripped from my nose . This , I thought , was overacting the part . I longed to take his place in our drama ; I could devise any number of painful cranks and pinches that would send him reeling , if we but exchanged roles . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she . " If he is reformable , well ; if not , mayhap the world should be unencumbered of him . " " Milady . " " Now as to the diamond , " she said , " in what condition will you say it stands ? " " It has been polluted by some means or other , " Astolfo replied . " You were correct to observe that its shine had somewhat muddied and its brightness occluded . Yet it is such a grand diamond , such a valiant one , that I believe it must possess inherent strong virtue to regenerate itself , to purge the darkness from it . " " That would be a beatific event . " " My advice is , Blight to blight and nevei night . That is , milady , " t would be best not to shut it away in casket or box or vault , surrounded by black gloom and tomblike silence . Better to bring it to its own likeness and let it breathe there and find itself again . Your own physic may strengthen along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the accounts of history and the writings of sages that the health of the possessors stands in close relation to the condition of the stones they possess . I could furnish many a treatise and pluck from memory countless examples . " He paused and cleared his throat . " Perhaps , if you have time and patience , you might hear the little known story of the lady Erminia and her opal . It so closely was attached to her thoughts and moods that it changed hue and some have said , even its shape , as her own thoughts journeyed and her moods shifted .... " And then Astolfo went on to tell at length , with intriguing detail and in high-colored language , that story of Erminia he would brook no syllable of from my lips . I found this most irritating and might even have preferred another of Mutano 's blows to Astolfo 's elaborate tale of Erminia . I rattled my chain and Mutano , as if to oblige my unspoken thought , delivered a solid kick to my leg . Astolfo was concluding : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessor and possession are intimate and enduring . For the sake of the stone and for the sake of your own well being , I would pray you to place th diamond upon a sheet of the snowiest linen on a table in an open room , with two lamps set about it day and night to shed on it the warmest and most lucent light . I am certain that you will then see it return to its former brilliance . " " It may be as you propose , " the countess said , " but I mislike exposing my diamond in such a public area , so prominent to the eyes of all , with everyone passing by and about . Why , " t is to welcome thievery with a handwrit invitation delivered upon a salver . " Her doubtful remark brought us to the third part of Astolfo 's scheme . " It will be broadly approachable , milady . So it must be constantly guarded and its care must be given over to the responsibility of one who is completely , nay , slavishly devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person whom no taint of suspicion can ever join to , one who has served you faithfully for many a long season , someone you have learned to trust without stint or reservation . " " You intend my minister Chrobius , " she said . " But milady - " Chrobius stepped forward and made as if to remonstrate . " Our Chrobius hath many a weighty matter already in his charge , " the countess said . " There are affairs of state which pluck at his attention like hungry children at their mother 's apron . Matters of finance bedevil him , rumors of armed revolt , whispers of intrigue and conflict : Every day his hours are so overfull with such considerations that they spill out of their allotted times like oat grain pouring from a torn sack . " " If't vex not your forbearance , milady , let me plead , " Astolfo said , " for I believe there is no charge in all your affairs so urgent as this one . It touches directly upon your health and therefore upon the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a special , particular office in this regard . Let your Chrobius become Master of the Jewel . If any stratagem advance against the diamond , he shall find it out , though it be bid like an adder coiled in a cave in the cliffs of Clamorgra . " Chrobius came forward with unexpected quickness for an elderly man . " Milady Countess , I feel I must turn away from this sudden and injudicious honor . There are affairs of - " The countess giggled merrily and clapped her hands like an excited child . She drummed her heels on the rung of her chair . " Mastei of the Jewel ! " she cried . " Oh , that is a dear , a precious title . I do love the ring of it . " " Yet it is a grave responsibility and much hangs upon the office , " Astolfo warned . " If anything were to happen to the Great Countess Trinia Diamond , as the gemologists now name it , then all the consequence would be on the head of the Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It is grave-but also frolicsome , " she said . " It is done . I now declare thee , my good and faithful minister Chrobius , Master of the Jewel . It shall henceforth be your sole duty to guard by night and day , in peace and in war , in foul weather and fair , the welfare of the Great Countess Trinia Diamond . You shall be well rewarded in your service . " Chrobius did not betray himself by so much as the quiver of an eyebrow . " Yes , milady Countess . " He bowed and stepped backward into his place behind our trio . " You too shall be fitly rewarded , Master Astolfo . You have but to name your fee , be it not too burdensome to our treasury . " He made one of his unhurried , elegant bows . " The service was too trifling , milady , and I am still embarrassed by the perfidy of my once-apprentice , this Falco here . I could expect no reward . " " You can . You must . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I shall return every fortnight or so to see if all is in order , that no other gem has been brought to a proximity with the diamond , that it is kept in a bright , bare place all its own , and that no shadow is stealing into its heart like some arrant villain crawling into a secret cave in Clamorgra . " " Well then , " she said , " I fear not that I shall find some way to recompense your good effort . And now , as his last duty before he attendeth only to the jewel continually , Chrobius shall lead you the way out . " " Milady . " Astolfo bowed once more and we departed , with the wretched , battered , peevish Falco shuffling along in chains and devising in his furious mind many little revenges upon his friend Mutano . Chrobius proceeded before us through the great salon , through the corridors where the shadows no longer whispered ominous threats , to the wide hall at the front doors of the palace . Here he stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze , signaled to the footmen to open for us , then turned and padded away to his task of nursemaiding to the end of his days that immense diamond . Outside , we climbed into the carriage provided by the countess and set off toward Astolfo 's mansion . I sat in the corner of the vehicle , weary and resentful , yet pleased withal . Master and manservant sat across from me in high good humor . " A stout piece of work , methinks , " said Astolfo . " We need no gold in our pouch for this work . We stand to flourish in the countess 's favor and gratitudinous good will . We have the treacherous Chrobius in our power . Is't not a happy day 's labor , Falco ? And none so onerous , either . " " Easier , " I said , " much easier for you than for me . " I clashed together my shackles . Astolfo and Mutano grinned at each other . " Ah , lad , " said the shadow master , " when I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much you have yet to learn , there swims into my brain a vision of the wide and starry sky . "
