<p> Whatever its many other deficiencies , American political reality has often seemed tailor-made for fictionalizing . Just consider the rich welter of issues and personalities that hover around our present-day national politics : Congress ' special session on the Terri Schiavo case ; the 2004 Swift Boat Veterans ads ; the ongoing agons of the Valerie Plame case and the 9/11 commissions . We have a born-again dauphin commander-in-chief striving in countless ways to surpass his father 's wan patrician legacy and usually failing . We have Justice Sundays , the Cindy Sheehan vigil , and the America Supports You Freedom Walk  --  events that beg for adaptation as low farce or high satire . <p> Or , dare one say it , literature . There is a broader point to American political fiction , easy to miss amid the familiar sound and fury of the nation 's political and cultural life : Democratic politics is the country 's national epic  --  with such key matters as the franchise , political representation and America 's role in world affairs all adapting themselves over time to encompass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just for starters , the genuine literary questions raised by our own political eras leading issue  --  the war in Iraq and the peculiarly American errand of coercing the Middle East into a state of political self-reinvention . The confident projection of American power into an alien political culture , rent by tribal divisions , mirrors back to us unexamined assumptions about our own national identity and purpose . Many of the same questions can be raised about the shoddy federal response to the collapse of New Orleans ' physical infrastructure in the wake of Hurricane Katrina 's devastation  --  a ghastly reverse-image of the confident projection of U.S. power abroad . <p> In the ever-accelerating information age , journalism has taken on the role of chronicling both the march of political events and the shifting character of the nation 's political imagination . But technology and programming demands have made much political journalism far more shrill , instantaneous , and unreflective , and thus brought into still higher relief the literary virtues  --  reflection and depth of character chief among them  --  that our political fiction should be delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral issues at the heart of today 's politics , one could do worse than ask , what would George Orwell do ? In i984 , the political novel 's most famous modern exemplar , Orwell reckoned with the most decisive forces loose in the modern world : not merely the rise of totalitarian political regimes , but also the triumph of a depersonalized mass culture , the humorless bureaucratized workplace , and the abolition of historical memory . Long after the Stalinist nightmare dissolved , i984 has survived as literature  --  conjuring the vivid stink of Victory gin , the grim footage of mass carnage played for laughs , and the furtive state-forbidden sex of Winston Smith 's Oceania . The novel 's continued relevance was more than a function of Orwell 's imaginative genius ; it flowed at least in part from his service as a British propagandist during World War II , which awakened in him both a reverence for the democratic culture he had worked to save , as well as a nuanced understanding of the corruptions of politics and spirit that occur under totalitarian regimes shoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested development of American political novels , one need look no further than the pallid state of our own literary satire . Christopher Buckley now passes for the high-water mark of political satire in the nation 's literature . In 1994 , Buckley drew upon his experience as a speechwriter for Vice President George H.W. Bush to produce Thank You for Smoking , an engaging send-up of the grimly farcical rounds of advocacy for the tobacco industry , as well as of the excesses of its opponents . Since then , however , Buckley 's novels have acquired a one-note tetchiness in both tone and subject . They read less like gimlet-eyed parody than gussied-up O'Reilly Factor transcripts . <p> His latest novel , Florence of Arabia , contains more pained winces than belly laughs . It is the saga of Florence Farfaletti , a Foreign Service agent covertly orchestrating an uprising in the fictional Islamic fundamentalist kingdom of Wasabia in the heart of the Middle East 's " no fun zone " Every political force in Farfaletti 's path is turned into a surrogate for the motifs on the contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the clear point that politics is the sport of distasteful appeasers and politically correct prudes . The French are surrender-happy snobs ; gay characters are raging queens ; feminists are frigid scolds . Need I go on ? Thank you . <p> And Buckley is arguably the best political novelist now going . Lest you think I 'm picking on him for ideological grounds , consider The Librarian , also published last year by Larry Beinhart , the provocateur behind American Hero , which Barry Levinson later adapted into the film Wag the Dog . Beinhart 's novel relates how college librarian David Goldberg , in the course of collecting archival documents for a wealthy political donor , stumbles upon a trove of material showing the incumbent president , Augustus Scott , a thinly disguised W-figure now up for reelection , to be implicated in a boatload of nefarious conspiracies . They include , for starters , ballot-disrupting race riots in Florida and a plot to blow up the Statue of Liberty and a nuclear power plant . This is all done at the behest of big oil and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who served as a nurse in Vietnam while Scott evaded the draft . <p> An ultra-earnest book like The Librarian produces much the same self-distancing perspective on the political world as does a ham-fisted farce like Florence of Arabia  --  a vision of politics as the squalid self-interested manipulation of events beneath the dignity of any sane moral actor . The result is an odd political literature of principled non-engagement , wherein the task of protagonist and author alike is to rise above the subjects that propel character , plot , and literary experience . This arm's-length disdain for our literature typically shows that the political process is a bit like expecting all of Moby Dick to unfold without any mention of the whale . <p> Writers like Buckley and Beinhart are heirs to a longstanding distemper in American political fiction . They both look upon the political process as a great ethical contaminant and task their protagonists with escaping its many perils with both their lives and their moral compasses intact . What might be bracing satires wilt into two-dimensional fables in which the same basic lesson is learned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . <p> Joe Klein 's much-praised , anonymously published book Primary Colors , a campaign-trail roman a clef based on Bill Clinton 's 1992 presidential run , is perhaps our most influential recent variation on the theme . Just as its presidential aspirant Jack Stanton is transparently based on Bill Clinton , so is its narrator , the young black political operative Henry Burton , clearly modeled on former divinity student George Stephanopoulos . There are , to be sure , superficial differences : Stephanopoulos seems to be a self-tutored prig , and Henry comes by his moral pedigree via his dad , who was a civil rights-era preacher and political leader . But Henry spends most of the novel as Stephanopoulos spent his White House tour as domestic adviser : conspicuously fretting about the high compromises and low moral trespasses of his chosen political mentor . <p> Mainly , though , Primary Colors is a shallow novel about politics because it is a novel exclusively about the campaigning process  --  the media-centric business of gaining marginal advantage among a field of pandering presidential aspirants . As such , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; its moral dilemmas and its vision of political success turn alike on the packaging of mass sentiment in which nothing more is risked  --  and nothing more is at stake  --  than the tactical logic of spin . In this hermetic , process-dominated environment , Henry Burton 's disillusion becomes just one more prepackaged sentiment . It 's an ironic fulfillment of Eudora Welty 's famous dictum that politics and literature should maintain a " private address " ; Primary Colors is a novel where the process of politics decisively rules out the formation of literary character . <p> Klein 's tale of seduction and abandonment by the adulated great leader interlocks closely with the plot trajectory of Robert Penn Warrens big message novel All the King 's Men , published 50 years earlier and now being remade as a Sean Penn vehicle directed by Steven Zaillian . It 's probably no coincidence that the name of Klein 's narrator echoes that of Warren 's  --  an aristocratic newspaperman named Jack Burden drawn into working for Willie Stark , the thinly disguised Huey Long character who propels Burden 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Warrens novel has aged poorly . Its Faulknerian prose manages to be both purple and flat while its political reflections are just banal . ( " Man is conceived in sin and born of corruption , " runs Willie Stark 's oft-quoted motto , " and he passes from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud "  --  a nugget of wisdom as hard-won as it is subtly voiced . ) At the simple level of characterization , Jack Burden 's odyssey is unpersuasive  --  his alleged innocence is more a product of tedious grad school soliloquizing than any discernible virtue . Likewise , Willie Stark 's temptation of Burden into the lurid exercise of demagogic power is pasteboard populism , an opportunity to score cheap points against a discredited leader like Long  --  and the grievously distorted political persuasion he represented  --  on behalf of what is ultimately an aristocratic conception of Old South noblesse oblige . Yet Warrens overheated language of sin and corruption does hearken back to the odd moral fastidiousness that shapes so much of the obdurate badness of American political fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frontier infatuation and intense individualism , and most American novelists treated public life , like most reminders of old world civilization , with marked suspicion . The first American renaissance roughly coincided with the rise of Jacksonian democracy ; but in the 1830s , few writers dallied with the mass fascination with democratic forms that foreign visitors such as de Tocqueville found so absorbing . Hawthorne and Emerson openly derided the idea of political reform ; Poe and Charles Brockden Brown turned their gaze morbidly inward . Meanwhile , America 's most popular storytellers , James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving , hymned homely virtues , heartfelt romances , and unsophisticated accents , and had them all triumph over the sinister plottings of Europeans and American Indians . <p> Walt Whitman  --  a former clerk for the U.S. Department of the Interior  --  recognized that the true frontier of America was not , in fact , geographic , but political . With the most deadly political failure fresh in the nation 's memory , Whitman , in 1871 , issued his famous call for a distinctive , politically minded American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national literature , Whitman argued , was the only force adequate to heal a newly sutured American nation . The country 's " most fundamental want , " Whitman wrote , was " the clear idea of a class , of native authors , literatures , far different , far higher in grade than any yet known , sacerdotal , modern , fit to cope with our occasions , lands , permeating the whole mass of American mentality , taste , belief , breathing into it a new breath of life , giving it decision , affecting politics far more than the popular superficial suffrage , with results inside and underneath the elections of Presidents or Congresses  --  radiating , begetting appropriate teachers , schools , manners , and , as its grandest result , accomplishing , ( what neither the schools nor the churches and their clergy have hitherto accomplish 'd , and without which this nation will no more stand , permanently , soundly , than a house will stand without a substratum , ) a religious and moral character beneath the political and productive and intellectual bases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Whitman 's faith in the larger political uses of literature was justified in an age when sweepingly composed  --  if only erratically distinguished  --  works of literature furnished the leading edge of political reform . It was after all , Harriet Beecher Stowe 's landmark novel Uncle Tom 's Cabin that had galvanized Northern antislavery sentiment at the advent of the war . Edward Bellamy 's utopian novel Looking Backward spurred the Nationalist Party , one of America 's earliest homegrown socialist movements . Years later , Upton Sinclair 's novel The Jungle famously launched key reform legislation for the meatpacking industry . To reassert Welty 's cool distance is to be willfully ignorant of the broader impact of American letters and the course of American political history . <p> But for all the impact of novels of advocacy , we have consistently failed Whitman 's prophecy in one crucial respect . America has almost never produced a serious novel addressing the workings of national politics as its main subject . Indeed , it 's hard not to read Whitman 's own rueful characterization of his own literary generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just " whimpering and crying about something , chasing one aborted conceit after another , and forever occupied in dyspeptic amours with dyspeptic women "  --  and not remember many of the scribes churning out the modern American political novel . The genre is as distressingly flat and uninvolving as it was when " Democratic Vistas " was published . <p> By the time serious American novelists took up politics as a mature literary theme , the moral perils formerly descried at the borders of frontier life had migrated to a specific set of forbidding institutions  --  in the specific locale of the nation 's capital . Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner made this the unmistakable point of the first modern American political novel  --  and certainly the only one to supply the name of an actual political epoch  --  The Gilded Age . Twain and Warner 's 1873 book traces the fortunes of a frontiers ingnue named Laura Hawkins who has moved to the heart of D.C. salon society via the wholesome way stations of Missouri and East Tennessee . When legislation before the Senate threatens her father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . Swept up in the shallow , glittering , scandal-ridden world of Washington power politics , Laura meets with a sad , melodramatic end after being tempted into adultery and murder . Her noble brother Philip , who deems politics " the maddest Vanity Fair one could conceive , " turns his back on the process and beats a sylvan retreat to upstate small-town New York and his one true provincial love . <p> The Gilded Age was successful in its time , and while it has become overshadowed by Twain 's more richly imagined works , its legacy can be seen in the genre it established . From The Gilded Age on , Washington was to be the premier setting of a strikingly continuous American political fable of innocence at risk . This sturdy tale typically pitches a political naif 's fateful interest in the machinery of reform against the backdrop of irredeemably fallen , endlessly seductive relations of power in the nation 's capital . If much of America 's signature literature remains , in the memorable formulation of R.W.B. Lewis , the saga of the American Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If Twain and Warner staked out these themes for the mass reading public , Henry Adams sharpened and refined them for his cultivated East Coast peers in Democracy , which he published anonymously in 1880 . Democracy was subtitled , pointedly , an American novel , and so it was : a prim , yet oddly frank Victorian saga of a young widow , Madeleine Lee , daughter of a famous Philadelphia clergyman , who has determined to make her way in the world of Washington political power after years of leading the half-hearted life of a reformer and society lady in New York . She soon establishes herself as the keeper of one of Washington 's more lively and fashionable salons , and is squired about town by the Illinois Sen. Silas Ratcliffe ( a.k.a. the " Prairie Giant " ) , a Washington kingmaker clearly modeled on Chester A. Arthur 's legendarily corrupt secretary of state , James G. Blaine : " The beauty of his work consisted in the skill with which he avoided questions of principle , " Adams writes in one of the novel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds along a simple narrative arc : Ratcliffe 's courtship of Lee is gradually requited and ripens just as his true nature is exposed in the revelation that he took a major bribe from a trans-Atlantic cable firm . The dour moral of Adams 's fable is laid out by a minor character  --  a European diplomat at one of Mrs. Lee 's salons who is ( far from incidentally , in Adams 's own Yankee patrician moral universe ) also a Jew named Baron Jacobi . Discussing the question of political corruption in America , the baron announces " with his wickedest leer " : <p> " I declare to you that in all my experience I have found no society which has had elements of corruption like the United States . The children in the street are corrupt , and know how to cheat me . The cities are all corrupt , and also the towns and the counties and the States ' legislatures and the judges . Everywhere men betray trusts both public and private , steal money , run away with public funds .. You gentlemen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the head of the civilized world , can never learn anything from the example of corrupt Europe . You are right  --  quite right ! The great United States needs not an example " <p> After Madeleine finally rebuffs Ratcliffe 's proposal of marriage , the shifty Baron gets the last heavily symbolic gesture . Seeing Ratcliffe on the sidewalk outside the Lee house just after the senator 's suit is rejected , Jacobi mocks him with insincere congratulations for the engagement he knows to be broken ; and then , when the senator sets upon him in a violent rage , he beats him in the face with his cane . What more gruesome testimony could there be to the depths that American democracy has sunk  --  to be called out and bested by the likes of a withered , cunning , and morally superior old world soul like Jacobi ? <p> In the century and a quarter since Democracy 's publication , remarkably little has changed in the depiction of American political affairs in American literature . Joan Didion offered up her own updated version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator 's wife , with the heavily symbolic name Inez Victor , who gets enmeshed in a doomed affair with a CIA operative , a reverse-image of the romantic alliance at the heart of Adams 's novel . Only in Didion 's vision , the seamy side of democracy has become a full-scale global delusion and imperial folly : Victor 's affair takes place in Southeast Asia at the time of the fall of Saigon , and is interspersed with dyspeptic flashbacks from earlier U.S. campaign and media appearances , all reinforcing the weightless unreality of a world that is nonetheless going definitively to hell . <p> The arch fastidiousness of Adams and his many literary descendants seems misplaced in one crucial way : The American political system has never really staked anything on the preservation of innocence . Indeed , its structural genius is very much the reverse  --  using the self-interested agendas of political players to cancel each other out , interlacing the powers of government in order to limit the damage that one branch can do , and making ambition at least address , if not fulfill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , as any good reader of " Federalist 10 " can report , is an instrument of cynicism erected on the open acknowledgment that human nature is flawed . It has unfailingly survived ( and thrived ) despite the vices novelists suggest have brought it to its knees . Expecting anyone to journey to the seat of national power and deliver a Mr. Smith-like blow for the sanctity of scouting and motherhood is a bit like wanting the final act of a musical to be all gun battles and explosions : It 's what the critics call a genre error . <p> What 's more , this stubborn moralizing impulse is what makes American political fiction , even today , such watery and unsatisfying literature : It deprives writers of the best material . Do n't the intrigues sprouting from our well-known human flaws and excesses ultimately make for more engaging plots and character studies than the falls from grace of a thousand or so Washington ingnus ? You can consult any of the scores of wiser , better-written European novels of politics  --  Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's The Possessed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charterhouse of Parma , Gunter Grass 's Dog Fears , Joseph Roth 's The Spider 's Web , to name but a few  --  and see how much richer and more nuanced political fiction can be . You can also see the parry-and-thrust of ambition and vice sparking Gore Vidal 's better historical fantasias  --  steeped as they are in a rather perversely relished old world fatalism-such as Burr ; Lincoln , and 1876 . <p> But most of all , you can see exuberant besotted sinfulness of all varieties on rich display in the one truly great modern American political novel , Billy Lee Brammer 's 1961 The Gay Place . Unlike most novelistic chroniclers of our politics , who got their first close-up views of politics as either journalists ( Klein ) , political confidants ( Adams , Twain , and Warren ) , or mere consumers of news ( Beinhart ) , Brammer wrote of the political from a true insider 's vantage . He had been a press flack and speechwriter for Lyndon Johnson during his illustrious arm-twisting , back-slapping , and deal-making career as Senate majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pro-politician "  --  the sort of literary disclaimer that only seems to be necessary in American letters . <p> Brammer 's inside view helped him , first of all , to bring off a deceptively simple inversion : For him , politicians are not the tempters in the garden of American innocence . They are moral protagonists . As political animals , they 're accustomed to honoring few clear distinctions between their messy , conflicted , adulterous , and boozy lives and their obligations to the public weal , and so they are not in the business of sacrificing one for the sake of the other . This means , among other things , that they have few two-dimensional virtues to jeopardize and no melodramatic Victorian corridors of power in which to sully themselves . Brammer 's protagonists are all sublimely self-aware adults : They bed each other 's spouses and broker parliamentary support with the same bleary-eyed aplomb , and reflect openly about the shabby compromises and disappointments they spring on themselves as they imagine they are doing good . <p> And presiding above them all is the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gay Place is actually three linked novellas , all set in the bohemian-cum-political capital of Austin of the late 1950s , and what links them is Fenstemaker , who manages to serve as the prime mover of each tale , with the foreknowledge and consent of precious few others . In " Room Enough to Caper , " he coaxes an appointed boy senator  --  whose marriage is on the rocks and who is wracked with grief over what he takes to be his role in the death of his brother  --  into a reelection bid , by forcing a thuggish McCarthyite opponent on him , and jolting his self-respect back to life in the process . In " Country Pleasures , " he engineers a favorable divorce and child custody agreement for a trusted adviser by way of pretending to bed the adviser 's actress wife  --  all on the pasteboard set of the Giant-style film set where she 's filming her latest movie . And in the book 's finest extended tale , " The Flea Circus , " Fenstemaker abruptly revives one assemblyman 's career as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all in the service of winning passage of an education reform bill benefiting neglected poor and black students from a largely hostile legislature . Indeed , throughout the novel , the governor brings the personal agendas of everyone around him into alignment with a higher good , whether they  --  and sometimes even he  --  know it or not . <p> Fenstemaker is , in short , an anti-Willie Stark or Jack Stanton . Disillusion in so perfectly rounded and self-knowing a scoundrel is thankfully irrelevant . " The first principle , " he announces to one of his protgs , " is that you 've got to learn to rise above principle . " No one in Fenstemaker 's vast retinue ever quite manages to disown or chastise him , for they know that , far from defying their high-flown principles of politics , he embodies the possibilities of genuine political action . As Roy Sherwood , the jump-started adulterous reformer of " The Flea Circus " says , Fenstemaker is " Mahatma Gandhi and Rasputin . The Prince of Darkness and the Goddamn Mystic Angel . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I lost faith . Just the reverse . Because I might put so much faith in him I 'd stop believing in myself ? ' <p> Fenstemaker represents something else as well : a kind of heroic vitalism rarely found in a culture sapped by the very sort of cheap moralizing that turns up in your average American political novel . " The Flea Circus 's " Roy Sherwood again zeroes in on this point as he ponders a pair of truly earnest naifs in his political circle : <p> " They were all such amateurs , he thought . Risen out of innocence , out of grace passing into awareness and a kind of hollow sophistication with hardly a corrupting experience  --  a genuinely horrific crime  --  come in between . And there were parallels . You could trace the wornout course of their piddling derelictions right alongside their politics . It was n't enough ; not enough to break through into awareness and good intentions ; not enough , moreover , to stand away and point to how the public and private business ought to be carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , it was ruinous . He wondered about the Governor . Had he somehow managed to transcend into some blessed state , passed them all , perilously close to the abyss until reaching a point of holy ground from which he could view the whole speckled landscape , viewing it with a tyrannizing emotion ? At least he remained operative  --  old Fenstemaker  --  he knew what absolutely had to be done ; he could engage himself and then withdraw without losing that commanding vision . . The truly able , it appeared , had only so much time to squander on disillusion and self-analysis . Then those destructive vanities were turned round and put to the business of doing what had got to be done . The truly gifted , as opposed to the merely clever , were too busy running things to be bothered . He thought of his cat.battling himself against a mirror ? ' <p> This half-drunken interior monologue neatly and sparely dispatches the self-serving lie of American political innocence and its many " piddling derelictions ? ' It also , far from incidentally , points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve even after tasting the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and setting up shop as harvesters and fermenters of that fruit . Fenstemaker is a forever unstable compound of means and ends , virtues and sins , righteousness and vanity  --  no less so than his real-life model , who masterminded both the Gulf of Tonkin resolution and the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts . <p> But he 's also , like any such tortured literary character from Ahab to Winston Smith , hostage to his own saving plan of action  --  that " commanding vision " allowing him to arrange and disarrange events according to his own holy ground " perilously close to the abyss . " The genius of Brammer 's novel is its willingness to wrestle openly with the implications of a tragic , divided political nature  --  not merely for stars of first magnitude like Fenstemaker but also for the many lesser political beings in his orbit , falling so continuously short of the glory . True knowledge of sin , after all  --  not the lurid self-dramatizing Robert Penn Warren kind  --  is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal democracy on the North American continent . Under that dispensation , everyone is an imperfect vessel of the people 's will  --  most especially those anointed its official servants . In this scheme of things , politics is , quite literally , Fenstemaker 's saving grace , and his often brutal and cunning course through Brammer 's novel charts a very American , though thankfully illusion-free , pilgrim 's progress . Such is the stuff of great literature  --  and , indeed , of reasonably good politics . <p> Whitman emphatically agreed . Toward the end of " Democratic Vistas , " he urged the nation 's young men never to scorn the stuff of political engagement , however unseemly it appeared under the grotesquely corrupt husbandry of the Grant administration : <p> " It is the fashion among dillettants and fops ( perhaps I myself am not guiltless , ) to decry the whole formulation of the active politics of America , as beyond redemption , and to be carefully kept away from .

America , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notwithstanding these antics of the parties and their leaders , these half-brain 'd nominees , the many ignorant ballots , and many elected failures and blatherers . It is the dillettants , and all who shirk their duty , who are not doing well . As for you , I advise you to enter more strongly yet into politics . I advise every young man to do so ? ' <p> Whitman was anything but pie-eyed about American politics , as befits a former Grant administration appointee who had been abruptly discharged when he was discovered to be the author of the " immoral " Leaves of Grass . He wrote candidly about what he confessed was the " appalling prospect " of a less-than-informed universal suffrage ; he also wrote of the grim watches he endured as a nurse to military casualties on both sides of the Civil War . But he was also a sufficiently sharp-eyed writer to see through the vapid pose of unearned political disillusion , and to savor the genuine imaginative promise of American democracy . One certainly ca n't read Whitman 's impatient litany of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the temper of our politics . Likewise for the prospect of the nation " doing very well " in spite of said temper . So let the dilettantes and fops of our own grimly diminished literature , besotted with its fashionable gestures of despair , reflexive irony , and terminal purism , take heed . In pursuing their own reveries of unsullied detachment from the political fray , they 're acting much like Roy Sherwood 's cat , ardently doing battle with half-comprehended superficial impressions of the world , and bumping up against its own reflection . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Christopher Lehmann <p> <p> Christopher Lehmann is an editor at CO Weekly and the author of Revolt of the Masscult .
