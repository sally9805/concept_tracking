Chapter One It was the cicadas that pushed everything into critical mass . The cicadas and a paranoid schizophrenic . The cicadas , a paranoid schizophrenic , and a hat made of defective aluminum foil . But mostly , it was the cicadas . St. Louis in the summer is miserable enough . Hot , humid , and suffocatingly still , it resembles an anteroom to hell . Tempers shorten . Frustrations sharpen . What would be annoying any other time becomes unbearable . But that summer was even worse . A cicada population of biblical proportions had awakened from two separate periods of dormancy to drive every person in the bistate region to violence . Breeding and eating at a ferocious rate in their hurry to mate and die , the insects whined out a satanic symphony of grinding dissonance that could incite a saint to suicide . Within days , minor car accidents escalated to hostage situations , suburban soccer morns were arrested on felony weapons violations , and sporting events saw more action in the stands than on the field . The recently declining violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts , and emergency departments started stockpiling antipsychotic drugs like nuclear arms . Which meant that nobody was really surprised when the disturbance call went out at 11:32 A.M. on a late-July morning for the four hundred block of Ohio Avenue on the city 's south side . A bare-bones kind of street , Ohio boasted faded brick multiple-family dwellings that housed the substrata of people hanging on to the fringes by their fingertips ; new immigrants , ex-project inhabitants , chronic defaulters . In a word , the kind of block where disturbance calls were as common as bill collectors . Usually , though , the calls came long after lunch , when the avenue 's less wholesome tenants woke from their nightly revelries . Eleven-thirty was a little early , even on this kind of hot , still , muggy day . But then , the cicadas were out . The responding unit arrived on the scene at precisely 11:53 A.M. to be met by a young black woman up to her elbows in toddlers , and one teary-eyed ten-year-old in a pom-pom skirt . A baby on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't bother to wait for the cops to get all the way out of the car before she started in on them . " He crazy ! " she shrieked , waving her free hand at the undersized cheerleader who slumped next to her . " He tried to boil my baby , say she a devil , and all she done was try and sell him some damn candy bars . You get in there and drag his skinny white ass down here ' fore I boil it myself , you hear ? My Sherees , she got ta sell forty bars by tomorrow , and he got the whole box in there , that crazy fucker . " Busy slipping batons into belts and caps onto heads , the cops , a rare two-person ride that consisted of a young white male and a more mature black woman , nodded like synchronized swimmers . " You know this man ? " the female officer asked . " He jus ' moved in a coupla weeks ago , " the mother said , following them up the sidewalk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with squirrels and bats and shit . I saw it when I grabbed my baby . Motherfucker 's crazy ! " After a few more pertinent questions , the officers left the woman in the street and ambled into the unremarkable square brick building whose only ornamentation was a bouquet of blue plastic flowers stuck into the address , atop which several of the ubiquitous cicadas were mating . Back on the street , the young mother raised her voice above the noise to regale gathering neighbors with her eyebrow-raised , neck-snapping rendition of Sherees 's run-in with the new neighbor . She 'd gotten to the point where she 'd grabbed little Sherees out of the crazy motherfucker 's arms when two quick pops brought the group to sudden silence . Gunshots . From the second floor of the apartment building . Everybody turned that way . Little Sherees , her tears dried , looked up at her stunned mother . " Mama , you tell them ' bout the gun that man stuck up his pants ? " Which was about the time the crazy motherfucker started yelling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she opened the door to the command trailer at the corner of Ohio and Wyoming . A normally unprepossessing 120 pounds over a five-foot-five-inch frame , Maggie looked instead like an extra from a Chuck Norris movie . Her thick umber hair was tucked up under a blue kerchief , and her rather normal figure was rigged out in blue-dyed urban cammos , elbow and knee pads , jump boots , Eagle pack , Camelback hydration system , body armor , overloaded medic vest , and gas mask . She carried her Kevlar helmet under her arm and her gloves in her helmet . SWATBabe , as her friends had dubbed her , was on duty . The four hundred block of Ohio had been evacuated of all but police equipment and personnel . Two perimeters had been established , the interior perimeter two apartment houses wide , the exterior taking up the entire block . Strobes flashed , radios crackled , uniforms cluttered the street , and a smaller knot of like-camouflaged men clustered near the midnight blue trailer Maggie approached just beyond the interior perimeter . Maggie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the rest of the newly minted St. Louis City/ County Cooperative Special Weapons and Training Team only moments before . It was her third call as the team 's Tactical Emergency Medic , the first that was still active by the time the team arrived . The very first in which she 'd been called into the trailer . She hoped nobody noticed that her hands were shaking . " You want me , Lieu ? " she asked , stepping up into a tiny space containing way too many bodies and an overworked air-conditioner . " Other side of the trailer , Mags , " the scene commander said from where he was bent over a grease-pencil-marked schematic of the block . " We have a medical situation inside the negotiators need you to help with . " Maggie nodded and backed out . It was standard operating procedure that the command center stayed separate from the hostage negotiators . The negotiators needed to establish a positive relationship with the hostage taker , something that could be jeopardized if that negotiator looked up to see the commander sending in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The way the St. Louis team had set it up , a third person stationed himself with the negotiators to relay news to command by headset . When a hostage situation involved a possible medical problem , the medics were trained to evaluate and assist along with the negotiators . So Maggie knocked on the back door of the divided trailer and waited for one of the extraneous personnel to decamp before climbing aboard . " We 've got a medical person coming to talk to you , Bob , " one of the negotiators was saying into the phone , his voice low and calm and soothing . The kind of voice you 'd use with a jittery horse or a crazy person . " ... yeah , sure , sit back a second . Let me fill her in , and I 'll let her talk to you . " The negotiator was a middle-aged , medium-sized black guy with old , soft eyes and fidgety hands who looked oddly out of place in jump boots and high-tech gear . Surreptitiously putting the caller on hold , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look fine , " he greeted her with a smile . She grinned back . " I look like a click beetle on steroids . " It would n't do to give her father 's old partner the kiss she usually greeted him with . " Hi , Uncle John . " " Tommy would be so proud . " Maggie held on to her smile by force of will . She did n't need to know how proud her father would be right now . " Oh , shit , " the other guy in the trailer moaned . " I just knew it . If we have a crazoid , O'Brien ca n't be more than five feet away . " The other guy Maggie knew , too . A sergeant out in Manchester where Maggie played paramedic part-time , he was trim and slim and military-issue , right down to his blond buzz cut and snapping gray eyes . And he just loved being a cop . " What do you mean ? " John asked , forehead creased . The other guy scowled . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut magnet . She 's the pilgrimage destination for every psychotic , schizophrenic , and dome-headed geek in the Midwest . " " Slander , Flower , " Maggie disagreed . " I 'm sure I do n't pull any more net-jobs than anybody else . " Flower , nicknamed in an homage to Bambi because of his unfortunate preference for Mexican food , hooted in derision . " So you really think it 's a coincidence that you 're the medic called for a guy who tried to parboil a pom-pom girl because her candy bars were possessed ? " Maggie shot Flower a sheepish grin . " Could happen to anybody . " Maggie spent a moment wiping the sweat from her forehead . It was damn near a hundred degrees outside , she was carrying about seventy pounds of equipment on her , and the cicadas were driving her to distraction . And to top it off , she had to score her first negotiating gig with John , whom she respected more than almost anyone in the world . Even the meat locker air-conditioning in the trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition is more than just little voices ? " she asked . John 's smile was a bit tight . " Suspect and hostage have both suffered gunshot wounds . Suspect to the right arm , hostage to the right thigh . That 's all he 'll give us so far . The suspect 's name is Montana Bob . " Maggie forgot about the humidity and sat down on the other chair . " Bob ? " she asked , peeking out the window . " No kidding . And in an apartment , too . I 'm so glad . He 's been camped out beneath the Fourteenth Street overpass for years . " " You know him ? " John asked . " Did n't I tell you she would ? " Flower retorted . Maggie smiled . " Oh , sure . You 've seen Bob , Uncle John . He hangs around the Toe Tag Saloon all the time . He 's a regular at the Biltmore . " The Biltmore being the nickname for Blymore Memorial , one of the big trauma hospitals in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trauma nurse . " Brings me flowers . Bob 's a paranoid schiz with delusions of U.N . invasions . Which means the candy bars are n't really satanic . Probably more along the line of a transmitter from ' them . ' " " Them ? " John asked . She smiled . " You know , John . ' Them . ' CIA , FBI , aliens . The ones who are trying to take over . The ones who wire his head and try and get him to do bad things . The candy bars probably had a diabolical device planted in them-computer chips being the latest favorite-to control his mind . " " To kill him , actually , " John said . Maggie nodded . " He is kinda fun to play with , is n't he ? " " The hostage he shot , " Flower snapped , " is an officer . " Maggie stopped cold . " We know who it is ? " Her Uncle John looked hard at her . " Yeah , Mags . It 's Scan Delaney . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . " Maggie was real proud of herself . She did n't give herself away by any more than by a blink or two . " You know him , too , I 'm assuming ? " Flower asked . Uncle John smiled gently . " Maggie knows everybody in the city . She grew up in the department . " Maggie did her best to smile back . " Delaney 's dad and Tommy were asshole buddies , " she said . " We kind of grew up together . " Then , before John could reassure her again , she set down her helmet and held out her hand for the headset . " Tell me what the status is . " " Delaney and Myla Parker answered a disturbance call . Evidently Montana Bob saw the uniforms and pulled out the .38 nobody knew he had . Sean got Myla out before Bob got him . That 's been about .... oh , seventy-five or so minutes ago . " " Myla 's okay ? " " Yeah . " " And Sean took a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it's- " " Just a scratch , " Maggie answered along with him . " He said the same thing last year when we put a chest tube in him . " A breath . A quick close of the eyes to lock out Uncle John 's distress . " Okay . " Maggie nodded and flipped the mike on . " Bob ? " she greeted her longtime patient , her tone an instinctive echo of John 's . " It 's Maggie-o , Bob . Can you talk ? " There was a brief moment of silence , a scuffling sound on the line , and then the tremulous voice Maggie knew so well . " You bastards . You 've taken her , too . " Maggie could n't help but grin . Well , at least she was on familiar turf . " No , Bob , I swear , it 's Maggie . Nobody 's hurt me . You know I wo n't let ' em hurt you if you listen real close . " Nothing . " Bob ? " " Prove it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , Bob , can you see the big blue van outside ? I 'm gon na step out the door and give you our sign . Now , I 'm going to be dressed like them , Bob , but that 's okay . They 're here just to make sure nothing worse happens , you understand ? If you listen to me , nobody else is going to get hurt . Okay ? " " I 'll shoot you if you 're lying . " John , on the other headset , twitched with distress . Maggie waved him off . " I hope you would , Bob . Now , watch out the window . " " Be advised , " Flower was murmuring into his own headset to the command post . " Subject is approaching the front window . Believed to be nonhostile . " " C2 to A10 , " Maggie heard in the receiver taped to her free ear . " Make entry to building on my word . " Which meant that while they knew where Bob was , the entry team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's apartment . Maggie yanked off the headset and eased her way out the door . It was oddly quiet out there , even the cicadas hushed . Weapons had been raised a notch higher , all attention focused on that window . Maggie saw a shadow in the apartment window , saw the blinds raised . She caught the sight of a lot of pale skin and the dull glint of metal and almost laughed . " What the hell ? " one of the guys demanded . " C2 to A10 , suspect is visible in side one number three window . Go now . " Maggie ignored the voice . She never acknowledged the dark snake of police that slipped toward the rear door . Lifting her arm as high as she could , she flipped the Longhorn salute . There was a pause , and then the odd figure in the window disappeared . Maggie squeezed back inside the van . " Did I see what I thought I saw ? " Flower demanded , lowering the binoculars he 'd been using . " A naked man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , reclaiming her chair . " Sure . His aluminum foil hat must have stopped working . " " What does that have to do with the Longhorn salute ? " " Bob went to University of Texas , " she said , sliding the headset back on . " Hence the moniker , ' Montana Bob , ' obviously . " Maggie grinned . " The CIA took over Texas years ago . " " I 'd heard that , " John concurred . " Bob ? " she asked , back on line . " You there ? " " Thank you , Maggie , " he whispered . " You walked the valley of death for me . Just for me , for me . But you have to get out . They know I know , and they 're going to kill me . I do n't want them to kill you , too . " Continues ...
