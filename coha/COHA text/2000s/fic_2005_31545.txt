Bad Boys to Go By Lori Foster Janelle Denison Nancy Warren KENSINGTON PUBLISHING CORP . Kensington Publishing Corp . Gil Watson was both nervous and excited-an odd combination he had n't experienced since his first years of college . These days he was confidence personified , commanding even , an in-charge guy perfect for the corporate world . He prided himself on his professional demeanor , his calm outlook on life . He had a business to run for his family ; they relied on him and he enjoyed that . He 'd grown up-kand in the process permanently buried all wild inclinations . But today , the figures blurred on the computer screen in front of him . He was n't getting much work done , which seemed to be the norm of late , rather than the exception . It had taken only one phone call to throw him off track , but then , it was n't every day a man learned he had a daughter , a daughter he had n't known of until two weeks ago . He had n't been the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half years , was a child developed enough to look like anyone ? What he knew about babies would n't fill a thimble . At thirty-two , he concentrated on knowing business , family responsibility , and finances . And not to brag , he also knew women . But he knew zilch about being a father . It still boggled his mind that Shelly had never said a word . He saw her two or three times a year , whenever business took him to Atlanta . He 'd been to her office , to her home , met her coworkers and friends . Right after his father 's death three years ago , he 'd been so sick at heart that he 'd done things he was n't proud of . Like using Shelly . Not that she had n't been willing . She 'd sent him one of her looks and he 'd reciprocated , and within the hour they 'd gone from business associates to lovers . He still remembered the wild , frenzied way she 'd taken him . For two days , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd catered to his sexual needs , his fantasies , and even his less than orthodox demands-the demands he 'd thought well under control . She 'd been everything he 'd physically wanted and needed at the time . In truth , she 'd wrung him out and left his body and mind thankfully blank for an entire weekend , relieving his sense of loss for his father , obliterating his concern about taking over the family business and the overwhelming responsibilities he 'd accepted as his own . It was when he 'd awakened and saw her looming over him , smiling with too much emotion for a mere sexual coupling , that Gil had realized his mistake . Shelly wanted a husband and apparently saw him as a prime candidate . But he did n't want the burden of a wife added to the new load he already carried . His oldest brother was a cop , his youngest brother still in school , and his mother had never involved herself with the company . Taking over the successful family novelty business and keeping them all financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most staid , the only one who 'd shown an interest , his father 's protg . No , the last thing he 'd wanted was a wife to further muddy the waters , so he 'd done what he considered wise and responsible . He 'd gently explained his lack of interest and had never again touched Shelly sexually . Yet she 'd had his baby and continued to associate with him as a close friend . Without once ever telling him . Gil 's stomach clenched over such a deception . He had n't known , damn it , but that was no excuse . Shelly had taken care of their baby alone and now she was gone . He could n't make things right by her-but he could raise their daughter . And he would . Giving up , he closed out the computer program and leaned back in his chair , his mind churning with regrets and curiosity and that persistent nervousness . A baby , his baby . Jesus . A small commotion in the outer office drew him forward again in his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the door opened and his assistant stuck her head in . Her frown rivaled his own . " Gil , you have ... company . " At fifty , Alice was n't prone to melodrama . Her expression had Gil rising from his desk in a rush . " Who is it ? " " Well , the young lady introduced herself as Anabel Truman . And the youngest lady is Nicole Lane Tyree , as I understand it , although all she 's done is suck her thumb . " Every muscle in Gil 's body went rigid . His brain cramped . His daughter was here-with Anabel-two weeks early . He rounded his desk with a long stride . Damn Anabel , he 'd offered to come to her , to buy her airline tickets , to pay for their transportation . As contrary and outrageous as ever , she 'd refused , telling him it 'd be at least ten days before she could leave . Ten long days before he 'd get to meet his baby . Yet she was here , at his office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than at his home where he might keep his private business private for a little while longer . At least until he could figure out what to do , how to proceed ... Arms crossed and eyebrows lifted , Alice moved out of his way as Gil charged forward . If this was a deliberate ploy on Anabel 's part to discredit him , he'd-well , he did n't know what he 'd do yet , but he 'd think of something . Because Anabel had been Shelly 's roommate , he 'd known her as long as he 'd known Shelly . She was always there when he visited , always twitting him , picking at him . Her presence was always unnerving ; she made him think things he should n't think , things he had tried not to think now that he had new responsibilities to consider . As Shelly 's best friend , she 'd been off-limits then . But no more . He threw the door wide and then froze , his heart shooting into his throat , his stomach dropping , his knees almost giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on him ? She looked the same as always : seductive . He 'd never really liked her . She was too outspoken and pushy . Too overtly sexual and in your face . Too ... hot . She was one of those women you just knew would be incredible in the sack and it made him nuts . It was n't just her jewelry , her overdone makeup and risqu clothing that had made her far too difficult to ignore . There 'd been something about the way she watched him , too , her close attention , the carnality in her gaze that made him wonder if their basic natures might mesh . That thought had kept him on edge whenever he was around her . Now he realized that she might have Watched him for the simple reason that he was Nicole 's father and did n't know it . He might have totally misread her . When she 'd called , her tone had been devoid of accusation , empty of any real emotion when usually she teemed with emotion . She 'd told him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a detachment that had left him bewildered and floundering-a situation he did n't like one bit . He was used to being in charge , of knowing what he did and why and having no doubts whatsoever . Did it matter to Anabel that he had n't known of the baby ? She stood there now in low-slung , faded jeans , a clinging stretch top of bright pink and ... oh God , she had a belly button ring . He fixated on that for what seemed like an inordinate amount of time before he heard her low , throaty laugh . He jerked his gaze up to her face . The woman was beyond outrageous , and in the months since he 'd last seen her she 'd only grown more so . " Anabel . " Thankfully , his tone was even , polite . " This is a surprise . " " I know . " She grinned , and that grin was so teasing that Gil felt it like a tactile touch . Then he saw the exhaustion she tried to mask , the utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed every other emotion . " What 's happened ? " At the sound of his voice , a pale face surrounded by dark curls peeked out from behind Anabel 's knees . Until that moment , Gil had n't noticed the tiny hands hugging around her legs , the little bare feet behind hers . The baby , his baby , was hiding . At his very first glimpse of her , Gil 's heart turned over . He could n't get enough oxygen into his starved lungs . She was so tiny , he had n't expected ... Without really thinking about it , he went to one knee , putting himself more on her diminutive level . " Nicole ? " The little girl blinked enormous chocolate brown eyes framed by long lashes . Her rosebud mouth crumbled and she tried to climb up the back of Anabel 's legs , saying , " Mommy ! " Mommy ? Taken aback , Gil lifted a brow and looked to Anabel for some explanation . Anabel pulled Nicole around to her front and playfully scooped her up , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little rat , remember what I told you ? I promise you do n't need to be afraid . " Little rat ? But the child had a stranglehold on Anabel that she could n't pry loose , so it did n't appear she 'd taken offense at the less than complimentary endearment . Anabel glanced at Gil and shrugged in apology . " It 's been a long trip and she 's tired . " Disappointment shook him , but Gil hid it . At least he hoped he did . He rose slowly to his feet again . " Come into my office . " Stepping back , he held the door open until Anabel had swept past him . He could feel her energy , detect her light flowery scent . Behind on his office floor she 'd left a large colorful bag overflowing with a tattered stuffed bear , a faded print blanket , a squeeze bottle of juice , and other baby paraphernalia . Blank-brained , at an utter loss , Gil looked at Alice . In her typical no-nonsense manner , Alice lifted the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might need this . " " Of course . " The damn thing weighed a ton . " Hold all my calls and cancel any appointments . " " You were meeting your mother and brother for lunch . " His brain scrambled in panic mode before settling on a course . " Call Sam . Tell him Anabel is here . He 'll understand . " " You 're the boss . " Alice hesitated . " Gil , if you need anything else ... " She 'd been his father 's secretary , and now his . She was protective and loyal , and Gil sent her a smile of gratitude . " Thanks . I 'll let you know . " Then , on second thought he added , " How about some coffee , Alice ? " " I 'll bring it right away . " " Thank you . " Gil stepped into his office , shut the door , and tried to figure out what to do next . He silently tallied the facts at hand : Anabel was here , a woman he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , a child he 'd only just found out about but already cherished . His life was about to undergo some drastic changes . He had to do something-but all he managed was to stand there , watching the two of them . Anabel had sprawled in his black leather desk chair , the child on her lap , and she was whispering in Nicole 's ear , kissing her downy cheek , and rubbing her narrow back . Gil wanted to hold her . He wanted to cuddle his child and know her and let her know him . The feeling was so alien , yet so powerful , Gil naturally shied away from it . " We 're starving . " Anabel glanced up at him . " You got anything to eat ? " Finally having a purpose , Gil strolled to his desk to perch on the edge and pushed the intercom button . " Can we order up some lunch , too , Alice ? " " Sandwiches , pizza , soup . " He turned to Anabel , leaving the choice up to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some salad for me , too . And a Mountain Dew if it 's available-I could use the caffeine kick . I have juice for Toots , here . " Alice said , " Give me fifteen minutes . " With that accomplished , Gil settled back , linking his fingers and resting his hands on his thighs . The pose was relaxed when he felt anything but . He made note of so many things at once . The dark circles under Anabel 's green eyes , the windblown disarray of her short , fawn-colored hair . The row of hoop earrings in her left ear , each increasing in size . Five total , he counted , the largest about as big as a quarter . A tattoo circled her upper arm . It appeared to be a horizontal flower vine , but it was too delicate for him to be sure without leaning forward for a closer look . And he was n't about to get that close to her . Nicole twisted slightly to see him , but she kept her nose stuck in Anabel 's neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were huge and wary . Gil tried for his gentlest smile . " Hello there . " " ' Lo . " He badly wanted to touch her , and he did n't deny himself . Slowly reaching out with only one finger , he stroked the silky soft hair over her temple . His heart threatened to punch through his chest . She shied away , going back into hiding and gripping Anabel with new fervor . " Give her time , Gil . She 's been through a lot . " The idea of what she 'd been though smote him clean through to his soul . He was her father ; he should have been there for her , protecting her , making her feel safe and secure no matter what else happened . He cleared his throat . " And you , as well . I know you and Shelly were close . " She looked away . In a whisper she said , " Toward the end , I barely knew her at all . " Toward the end ? The end of what ? Shelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him . What did she mean , then ? But his questions would have to wait until Nicole was n't listening . He did n't know how much a child her age might comprehend , and he would n't risk adding to her trauma . Alice knocked before stepping in with a tray of coffee and cups . " This will get you started before the lunch arrives . The little girl has something to drink ? " Anabel shoved to her feet with Nicole still clinging like a determined monkey . " Juice-never leave home without it . " " Juice , " Nicole mimicked . She stuck out one skinny arm in demand , grasping at the air with her tiny fingers . Gil wanted to melt on the spot . She was by far the most precious thing he 'd ever seen . " I 'll get it for her . " " Thanks . " Anabel hoisted her small burden a little higher in her arms . " Methinks naptime is closing in . " She winked at Gil , then moved to the leather couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to her . " You 're giving him a complex , rat . Say hi again , like you mean it this time . " Nicole sat there , her pudgy bare feet sticking off the couch cushion , sizing him up with an unblinking stare . To Gil 's surprise , she suddenly treated him to a beatific smile , wrinkling her little pug nose and scrunching her whole face up . " Hi . " " Good girl . " Anabel accepted the coffee that Alice handed to her and took a long sip , groaning in pleasure . " Wonderful . You 're an angel , thank you . " " My pleasure . " Alice retreated from the room . Cautiously , not wanting to startle her , Gil handed his daughter her juice . " Is it cold enough for you ? " " She does n't like it cold , do you , Nicki ? " Nicole did n't answer . She had the squeeze bottle tipped up , guzzling away until juice ran down her chin . Anabel quickly put her coffee aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicole turned to her side , put her head in Anabel 's lap , and just that easily , dozed off . " She 's run out of gas .
