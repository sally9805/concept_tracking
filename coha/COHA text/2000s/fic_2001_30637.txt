As Cassie Miller drove the Jeep Wagoneer down the sloping hill that led to the farm 's driveway , she caught herself chanting , " I think I can , I think I can . " Glancing ruefully at her reflection in the rearview mirror , she prayed that her nervousness would n't ruin her interview . The entrance to the driveway was marked by the sign Five Oaks . Pulling in , she steered the Jeep over to the side of the well-graded dirt road , cut the engine , and twisted around to face the backseat . " Okay , kids , time for a face and hands check . " Two small children looked back at her with matching deep blue eyes and golden curls . They waited expectantly . " All right , you guys , stick ' em up ! " Cassie said in her best James Cagney voice . The two giggling five-year-olds raised their hands to the level of the front seat and showed them to Cassie for inspection . Cassie took Jamie 's and then Sophie 's , examining each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean pairs of hands here . Now , Jamie , how many fingers have you got ? We do n't want any missing . " Jamie looked down , wiggling his fingers . " One , two , three , four , five , " he began and rushed on , " six , seven , eight , nine , ten ! " " That 's terrific . Now I know you 'll be able to shake hands politely with Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer . " " What about me ? " clamored Sophie , eager to be included in the game . " Have you got ten fingers , too , Pumpkin ? " " Yes ! " crowed Sophie triumphantly . " Just look ! " " Why , imagine that ! You 're right ! What luck . You do have ten fingers . " Cassie pretended to wipe her brow . " Whew ! I was so worried ! But what about your faces ? Are those peanut butter and jelly sandwiches you had at lunch in your tummies or on your cheeks ? " " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little doubtfully . " Hmm , I guess they look clean enough . " In fact , both Sophie and Jamie 's faces fairly glowed , Cassie having taken the precaution of arming herself with packets of moist towelettes for the trip . She leaned over and kissed their soft cheeks , marveling once again at the beauty of her two little imps . She was so proud of them . Had been from the day they were born . " You two certainly look smart to me . But let 's make sure of one last thing . Your shoes . Are they on the right feet ? We ca n't have you going off to an interview with shoes on the wrong feet ! " " But Mom , " cried Jamie in an aggrieved tone . " You 're the one who 's gon na get the job . We 're just kids . " " I do n't know about that . If I get this position at Five Oaks , you two will be my assistants . " " We will ? " Jamie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'll also need both of you to take care of Topper and Pip . Those ponies are a big responsibility . " " Yes , Mommy , we know . " " And , kids , I need you to be on your best behavior . Mr. Sawyer was super nice about letting you two tag along while I talk with him about working here . " " We know Mommy , Uncle Alex and Thompson told us that , too . " " About a zillion times . " " No , it was a quadrillion times . " Cassie smiled . " Right , well , do n't forget . I 'm counting on you . Now that that 's settled , how do I look ? Any muck on my face ? " Now it was the children 's turn to inspect Cassie . Treating the matter with utter seriousness , they leaned forward , bending at the waist to look at her more closely . Sophie pronounced judgement . " You 're the most beautiful mommy in the whole wide world ! " A bittersweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before attempting to speak . " Thank you , Pumpkin . I love the two of you very much . You 're so wonderful to me . " " But Mommy , " interrupted Jamie , who already knew he did n't like gooey kisses and hugs and wanted to stop things before they got out of hand , " Your hair is coming out again . " " Oh , dear , " cried Cassie in mock dismay . " Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer will just have to see the wild side of me . " As a child , Cassie 's hair had looked like Jamie 's and Sophie 's , but over the years the corkscrew curls had softened , so that now they more closely resembled riotous waves that flowed down to the middle of her back . But whenever she tried to tame it , pulling it back into a knot at the nape of her neck , as she had done for the upcoming interview , strands escaped and framed her face with golden curls . " Well , we 'd better get a move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to New York . I faxed the Sawyers and told them to expect us at about three o'clock . It 's just three now . " Cassie turned the key in the ignition and pulled the car back onto the driveway . The farm , she already knew , was spread out over two hundred acres of prime Virginia horse country . When Cassie had seen the job announcement , offering a dual position as trainer and rider for Five Oaks , she 'd immediately faxed her rsum and crossed her fingers . Professionals from all over the country would be responding to the ad . She 'd been thoroughly elated , as well as a bit astonished , when she received a call from Hank Sawyer asking her to come down for an interview . The driveway stretched for nearly a quarter mile with white wooden-fenced pastures on either side . Cassie and the children could see horses grazing on the new grass . As they reached the horse barns , pastures gave way to riding rings with brightly colored jumps set at various heights . Behind them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a wide circle around which stood five enormous oaks . Cassie parked , opened her door , then let the children out of the back . They clambered down from their seats , chattering excitedly . Cassie stood silently , taking a moment to gaze at the beauty of her surroundings . There were four barns in all , two attached together to form a T shape with the third one off to the side . As Five Oaks was a breeding farm , Cassie assumed that the separate barn was used for the brood mares . A fourth barn was set off at a distance . She noted with approval the pristine condition of the buildings . Painted white with dark green trim , they shone invitingly in the afternoon sun . Muffled noises and the occasional whickering of horses floated out on the air . " Come on kids , take my hands and let 's go find Mr. Sawyer . " They entered the shaded interior of the larger barn . Rows of box stalls flanked a wide concrete aisle . The barn smelled of horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as familiar to Cassie as the smell of her own home . As familiar and as loved . Hooked up to a pair of cross ties , a large bay was being groomed by a man wearing an Orioles baseball cap . He looked to be about thirty , and from his dark olive complexion Cassie guessed him to be Mexican . " Excuse me . Could you please tell me where I might find Hank Sawyer ? " The man stopped brushing but continued to lay his hand on the horse 's shoulder in a soothing gesture . A smile spread across his features when he saw the young woman holding the hands of two almost identical children . " He 's in the office . Follow this aisle down and then make a right . His office is around the corner . " From the man 's slight accent , Cassie knew that her guess had been right . " Thanks a lot . " The trio moved past the horse and Cassie ducked her head under the cross ties . " Mommy , " Sophie whispered excitedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Can we say hello to the horses as we go by ? " " Yes , a couple , but let 's not be late for our appointment . " Cassie knew only too well just how much time it might take two five-year-olds to say hi with this long a row of box stalls . Many of the horses standing with their ears cocked forward and their necks arched gracefully over the stall doors , seemed as inquisitive as the two chidren . They observed the humans ' progress down the aisle toward the office . The door to the office was shut , so Cassie let go of Jamie 's hand and knocked . From within , a voice called out instructing them to come in . Cassie , Jamie , and Sophie stepped inside . Behind a large desk piled high with stacks of papers and books , a man stood and came forward to greet them . " Hello , you must be Cassandra Miller . I 'm Hank Sawyer . You 're right on time . Hope the trip down from New York was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glance lighting on the two small children standing at her side . " And what are your names ? " " Hello , Mr. Sawyer , I 'm Jamie Miller . " Jamie stretched out his small hand . Hank shook it with a solemn smile , his large hand engulfing the tiny one . Sophie thrust out her hand , too , determined to be as grown-up as her brother . " Hi , Mr. Sawyer , I 'm Sophie . Jamie and I are twins . He was born before me . But I can count to twenty faster . " She boasted proudly . " That 's true for the moment , Sophie , but Jamie 's catching up to you . I 'd keep practicing . " Cassie glanced at Hank Sawyer . " Thanks again , Mr. Sawyer , for letting us impose on you this way . Sophie and Jamie learned all about the Baltimore Aquarium in school this year . They were desperate to come , so we 've turned the trip into a three-day cultural adventure . " " The aquarium 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll enjoy it . We 've taken our grandchildren there quite a few times . Just let me telephone my wife so that she knows you 've arrived . " Hank turned to his desk and picked up the phone . As he dialed , he looked up , " Make yourself comfortable . On the wall over there are photographs of some of our horses . " Sophie and Jamie scrambled over to the wall to peer excitedly at the pictures of horses soaring over fences ; horses standing in the judges ' circle , blue ribbons hanging from their bridles ; riders smiling as they leaned down to shake hands with women in sequined gowns . Cassie thought she could make out the younger features of Hank Sawyer as well as another , unidentified man . As she waited quietly while Hank spoke into the phone , she took the opportunity to observe him unobtrusively . He looked to be somewhere between fifty-five and sixty . His full head of hair was silver , cut short to reveal the strong bones of the face . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners of his mouth . The lines etched into his brow and the deep gold tone of his skin , even this early in spring , attested to the hours he spent under the sun . Cassie liked the way his eyes had crinkled up at the corners when he 'd smiled at Sophie and Jamie . She 'd also seen the shrewdness and intelligence in them , something she 'd expected to find . One could n't survive in the horse business , let alone run such a clearly successful establishment as Five Oaks , without those qualities . She hoped Hank was also a bit of a gambler , that he 'd be willing to take a chance on her . Hank interrupted Cassie 's thoughts . " Melissa will be here in just a few minutes . She was wondering whether the kids might be interested in a snack . " " That 's very kind of you . For the moment though , they seem pretty taken with your photo gallery . I noticed you rode at Devon , Mr. Sawyer . " " Call me Hank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about when I hear Mr. Sawyer . " His gaze skimmed the photographs on the wall . " Yes , a couple of those pictures are from Devon . I 'm just glad I was n't riding against you when those were taken . " At Cassie 's startled look , Hank smiled and continued , " Of course you did n't realize this , but I saw you compete both at Devon and Washington the year you were racking up points to qualify for the national team . You were amazing . And the way you handled that stallion , On The Mark , was incredible . You were what , barely nineteen , and you could hardly have weighed more than one hundred and ten , but you had him flying over those fences in the jump-off as if he were a merry-go-round pony in Mary Poppins . " The image of On The Mark being like a carousel ride brought a wide grin to Cassie 's face . " He was a great horse , a great teacher . I was lucky to ride him so early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen . And he taught me how important it is to figure out what makes each horse tick . In On The Mark 's case , it was his pride . " " Interesting . How did you come to that conclusion ? " Cassie 's hands lifted , gesturing as she explained . " He had such natural ability and he knew it . He was a cocky son of a gun . I realized that it really bothered him if he even so much as nicked a fence . He hated it , it threw off his whole performance . So I did my darndest to set him up perfectly for each and every fence . Then I tried not to mess around too much and let him do the rest of the work . By the end of that season , he was in a class by himself . Nobody could beat him . " " Well , when I got your rsum , your name rang a bell . It did n't take long to remember what you achieved with that horse . Those were some remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheeks . " Thank you . And please call me Cass or Cassie . I do n't think I 've quite grown into Cassandra yet . " That might be true enough . Although he knew from her rsum that Cassie Miller was twenty-four , there was a youthfulness to her face , especially with that charming blush that made her look hardly out of her teens . Far too young to be the mother of five-year-old twins . But the children looked a lot like her , he noted . Deep blue eyes and blond curly hair . It was like seeing the finished product when you looked first at the twins and then at Cassie . Even though Cassie 's hair was pulled back from her face , accentuating her wide , high cheekbones and her full lips , he figured that in about ten years , Sophie would be a close copy of her mother . Jamie , too , looked like he would be equally good looking . Cassie Miller stood an easy five foot eight good , she 'll be big enough to handle Orion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next took in the long legs and well-defined arms revealed by the ribbed cotton top she wore under her jumper . Hank would have been deeply embarrassed if someone had pointed out to him that he was cataloging Cassie 's attributes much as he might a horse he was interested in acquiring . But he would probably have argued that he had no use for a rider who was n't physically up to the challenge of riding their stallion , any more than he would be interested in purchasing a swaybacked , knock-kneed horse . Luckily , she had the look of a rider who kept her body in peak condition . Hank motioned for her to take one of the seats near his desk as they waited for his wife . As Cassie rested her elbows against the wooden arms of the chair , Hank noticed there was no wedding band on her left hand . Interesting . He was on the verge of broaching the awkward topic of why Cassie Miller 's bid for the national team had come to a disappointing nothing , when his wife , Melissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office . As he stood up to greet the women , he gave his wife a fond smile . Melissa had been his wife for thirty years and Hank loved her even more now than he had when they first married . She was his mate , partner , best friend , and his lover . She was also as good a judge of human character as she was of horseflesh . Hank wanted Melissa here for the interview with Cassie . Even with her excellent rsum and the memory of her skill with horses , Cassie was nevertheless something of an enigma . Why had n't she continued competing , trying for the national team ? After the Olympics , being a member of the U.S. equestrian team was most riders ' greatest ambition , so what had prevented her ? Riders with the kind of talent and skill she had just did n't drop off the face of the earth without a trace . As Hank remembered it , after that dazzling year , Cassie had vanished from the show circuit as if her season as the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question had been bugging him ever since he 'd recognized her name at the top of her rsum . He glanced at the twins , considering . No , not even a pregnancy should have kept her away from the circuit for so long . Pregnancy would have sidelined her for a year , eighteen months at most , but she 'd disappeared and had n't come back . He wondered if perhaps the twins ' father might have tried to discourage Cassie in her riding career , but if that was the case , what was she doing applying for the job at Five Oaks ? Thank heaven for Melissa . Hank had no doubt that a few subtle questions from his wife would provide them with answers to whatever had been going on in Cassie Miller 's life .
