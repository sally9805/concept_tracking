THE NEW NEIGHBORS across the street were a grave disappointment to my parents . Paint continued to peel from the clapboard , and the weeds that had conquered the yard during the long vacancy stood as bold as ever . What was one to think of such people ? The old van they drove was an offense in itself . <p> " They look like hippies to me , " my father said . <p> " What they are , " my mother said , " is artists . " She used the same tone of voice when she said " artists " that my father did when he said " hippies . " <p> There was one child , a boy named Dominic . He was about my age . Until then I had been the only boy on the block . It was through sheer grace that my parents allowed a friendship to develop between Dominic and me . <p> Dominic 's father , who never wore anything inside the house but a towel he called a lava lava , would let us stand close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail of his fingers . He talked about baseball a lot , but he did n't talk about anything when he was at the wheel . One day we watched him make a pot so tall it seemed to swallow his arm , all the way up to the shoulder . Dominic 's mother , who wore khakis and no shoes and kept her graying hair in one long braid down her back , glazed the pots her husband made . She gathered ashes from under the kiln he had built in the backyard , sifted them to a fine powder , made a mixture with water , and dipped the pots to be fired . She would let us help with the sifting and the mixing , but she always did the dipping herself . Sometimes she would dip a pot just so far and no farther . It was as though a voice , which we did not hear , told her when to swirl it out . <p> Except for the table and chairs in the dining room , there was almost no furniture in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a canvas directors chair he carried from one room to another , and his mother most of the time sat on bare floor , her head high , her back as straight as could be . Their books they kept on a board stretched between two concrete blocks . Above the books hung a matted and framed watercolor of a dragonfly . Even though it was larger than life , you could n't see all of the dragonfly . Mostly what you saw , and somehow saw through to sunlight , was a wing . Dominic told me that his mother did n't do watercolors anymore ; she had got them out of her system and was content to look at that one . The last part made sense because she did like insects and things of that order . I remember that one day she called us into the front bedroom to contemplate a spider web . It was not so much that she was holding class , but that she was inviting us to share her wonder . <p> In the back bedroom-or what would have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the wall , were the sacks from whose contents the clay was mixed . The dust of the mixing gave the floors a powdery look . Hardly a corner in the house was empty of pots . There were pots of every shape and of every color of earth . The only formal touch anywhere was the teapot on the mat in the center of the dining room table . It had been made by the master under whom Dominic 's father had studied in Japan . It was a gift of its maker-a priceless gift , Dominic said-and they used it every day because they loved it . <p> My familiarity with that family was conditioned more by the intensity of my response to their manner of existence than by the frequency of my visits . The truth is , I was not inside their house but five or six times . The intensity was prompted , no doubt , by the extreme contrasts between the two domains , that one and the one in which I lived . <p> My mother , though not a tyrant , believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the smells of it , and she was n't talking about the smells of artificial cleanliness that could be bought in a bottle or a can . She believed in scrubbing , vacuuming , dusting , polishing , straightening . Her house was her joy , she said . The irony was , she was so persistent in her warfare that on any given weekday the house was upside down . But by the time my father got home in the evenings , there was order . He sometimes complained to his friends that he was allowed to sit in only one chair in the house , his chair , and use only one ashtray , his ashtray . It was obvious , however , that in his own way he was actually marveling at the good choice he had made in a wife . As an accountant , he was an exacting person himself . His belief in figures was equaled by his insistence on neatness in their presentation , and he carried his professional philosophy over into his private life , right down to the Orioles . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records all the way back to the forties , crisply written in his own hand . He never had to wait for the statistics to be published , for during the season he updated them daily in the journal he kept on top of the television set . That Dominic 's father and my father both liked baseball did not blur their differences . While Dominic 's father talked about such things as the subtleties of movement which identified this or that man at bat , or the poetry of a freshly raked infield , my father held forth exclusively on those things which could be reduced to numerals . <p> I remember the time I was invited to spend the night across the street . It was a big decision for my parents . My mother called my father at the office to get his opinion , but he was busy and did n't have time to think about it right then , so I was kept hanging until he got home . I prepared myself for disappointment . I tried to prepare Dominic . I had to beat around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how much in question his parents were held by mine . I told him my parents were just strange , that was all . <p> My father came home and sat down and spoke of his reservations . My mother spoke of hers , and they were much the same . Did I think that those people across the street were our kind of people ? Had I ever observed anything at all that would lead me to think they were not ? <p> My father said , " They appear so loose to us . " <p> My mother said , " One does n't want to get into a situation where a friendship might lower one 's standards . " <p> They finally agreed that I might accept , provided that I help them make future decisions based on what I observed that night . <p> The invitation included supper . By the time I crossed the street and presented myself , I was afraid that supper might be over . That was hardly the case , though . Dominic 's mother was still cooking it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sitting on the floor in the living room , facing a row of new pots . The pots had been brought in from the kiln just minutes before my arrival . Dominic said that the pots would sing as they cooled , that we could hear them if we sat still and listened and waited . <p> I thought his father would explain what they were really doing , at least put it into believable terms . But no , his father continued to sit there in silence . His eyes were closed , yet you could look at him and tell that he was anything but asleep . <p> There was nothing to do but go along with the game . I certainly was n't going to laugh . I sat down cross-legged on the cold wood floor beside Dominic . Before us was a motionless procession of pots , rich in their glazes . I say motionless , but every time I looked away and looked back , there was a moment when they seemed to be still turning . One of them was as round as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of it was no bigger than a penny . Most of the pieces , like many of the others around that house , were not what I would now call pots , but I did n't then know what else to call them . They resembled large stones that had been washed smooth in a river . Yet they looked as breakable as they were , and more like things to look at than things to use . Their glazes suggested to me the eggs one might find in tall grass in a field somewhere . The holes in several of the pots appeared to have slipped , were almost on the sides . <p> I picked as my favorite a planet that had whirled so fast it had lost its shape and would have flown apart if some magic had not frozen it when it did . I remember that a tear of the glaze had run down on the part that was n't glazed . I think the tear was what I liked best about it , although I doubt that I could have said why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a very small voice . <p> Dominic drove a fist at my shoulder , as if to say , " I told you so ! " <p> Ping ! Tink ! <p> There was silence again , a deeper silence now . <p> In time came a regular chorus , or what we were happy to call a chorus . Silence answered silence more readily than sound answered sound-and how important the silences were in that music ! <p> " The sound of stars on a cold , cold night , " Dominic 's father said . <p> I had never thought of stars as making a sound , but I knew what he meant , and it was that kind of sound . <p> " I hate to interrupt the concert , " Dominic 's mother said , " but soup is on . " <p> And soup was what it was . Aromatic , delicious , hearty , homemade vegetable soup . My family sat down to vegetable soup frequently , but this was different , this was better . Perhaps it was the herbs in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing over the kettle watching the fury of colors boiling , the orange of the carrots , the emerald of the beans . Perhaps it was the pottery bowls in which it was served , which Dominic 's father had turned himself . Whatever the promptings , that was the occasion on which I first really looked at vegetables , looked at them and tasted them , tasted them and found them good . <p> That night I lay on the floor rolled up in the blanket they had given me , and I felt that I was about to escape one life and burst into another . I felt that somehow I was leaving my parents behind , to the point that I felt guilty about it , leaving those who loved me and would have fed me their last piece of bread . I lay there as still as possible , and now and then a small sound with an upward direction to it could be heard as the air chilled in the night . <p> The next morning I told my mother about the pots and how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was impossible to detect in her voice either belief or disbelief . <p> " They really did , " I said . <p> " I 'm sure they did , dear . " Her tone changed not at all . Her smile was as kind as could be . <p> My father , having overheard , became inquisitive . What did I mean ? How could a pot sing ? He seemed sincerely interested , and I was pleased . <p> He became a thoughtful audience as I imitated the sounds the pots made . He asked further questions , and I answered them the best I could . He put his hands in his pockets and walked through the house . <p> " The pots had just been removed from the kiln ? " he asked . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Ah- " <p> He turned to me and said he had it , he had figured it out . His eyes were lighted . He proceeded to tell me how the glaze on the pots was like glass , how it would contract when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still adhere to the pots and be almost invisible . Yes , that had to be it . The sounds were made by the cracking . It was perfectly logical . There really was nothing mysterious about it . <p> I sensed that a gift had been snatched from me , and yet I suddenly felt at one with my father , as though he had reached out and clasped me in his arms , his son . I do n't think I liked the feeling , but it warmed me in a way . Perhaps I realized that somehow I was being saved from the dangers he saw lurking behind certain marvels . At least I did n't have to feel guilty about bursting into another world and leaving my parents behind . The question I had to put out of my thoughts was why on earth I would have longed for such adventure . Despite the romance of the night before , and whether I wanted it so or not , we were clearly superior to the people across the street . <p> But I could not maintain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw things one way . When I was with Dominic 's family , I saw things another way . As it turned out , further decisions about spending the night were not necessary , for Dominic 's family moved away a few weeks after that . <p> They gave me a pot before they moved away . They told me that it was for my parents , but I understood that it was really for me . They gave me my choice . I picked the planet that had whirled so fast it had lost its shape , the pot on which the glaze had run down . Dominic 's father seemed pleased , and maybe a little surprised , that I picked the pot I did . <p> " You picked one of the better pieces in the house , " he said . " I 'm not ashamed of that one , not at all . " <p> I told him that my father had explained to me about the sounds the pots made . I do n't know why , but I felt compelled to tell him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Look closely . See all those cracks . They look like little veins , do n't they ? I can throw a pot as true as prayer , and my wife can glaze it with all that she is . But is n't it strange ? The finest character marks are right there , little cracks that go their own way . " <p> With great care I bore the pot across the street-across the Russian steppes , as it were . The thought of dropping it made a snail of me . I figured the trick was to hold it tightly but not too tightly . On that trip the houses seemed as far apart in actual distance as they were in spirit . <p> My mother tried to be appreciative , but she fell into frowns about what to do with the gift . It was quite lovely , she said , but the color did n't exactly " go " with anything in the house , nor did the mood of it . She called a friend of hers to come over and help her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she put the pot on the top shelf of the floor-to-ceiling built-in bookcase in the alcove off the living room , where it would n't stick out-and where , as her friend explained to me , it was less likely to get broken . My mother took her advice . <p> She wrote to Dominic 's parents a thank-you note on a sheet of paper that had a neat blue border around it . I delivered the note by hand the day before they moved . <p> " What do people like that live on ? " my father asked , watching their rented truck and their old van pull away . He and my mother had watched their possessions , few as they were , carried to the truck . <p> My mother said , " I wonder if they 're moving because they ca n't pay their rent . " <p> My father said , " Oh , you never can tell . They might have means we do n't know about . " <p> " They 're moving , " I told them , " to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusted the pot as dutifully as she dusted everything in the house , I 'll give her that . In its lofty exile it surely never collected but the thinnest film . My father , as far as I know , never again confronted the pot with his gaze or his thoughts . He was completely free of such things . <p> The house burned while I was away at college . The pot went with it , and so did my father . My mother said that she thought he ran back into the smoke to try to save his Orioles journal . She lived in an apartment the rest of her life . She lived in filth . What was the use , she said . I could say that she went with the fire , too . <p> I see Dominic occasionally . He 's a photographer . He makes the rounds of the agencies in the building where I work . We run into each other in the elevator . His mother died one of those long deaths you hear about , and his father , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck every last pot to bits . He had to spend some time in a hospital . I kept planning to visit him while he was there , but I never did . I even planned what I would say to try to get his mind off his loss . I was going to imitate some ballplayer at bat . I was going to give the particular hipwiggle of some ballplayer and say , " Who 's this ? " <p> I like to think that my life in architecture reflects , as practically as possible , both sides of the street . Yet it 's still a case of crossing back and forth , from one aspect of my work to another , from one person to another , from one relationship to another . There are times , when I allow myself a pensive moment , that I think my whole life is but a reverberation of the night I spent in that house across the street , and the morning after . <p> A house with better light is the house I have in mind when I sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a design element in itself . If my clients want a glass box , I 'm happy to oblige . In more traditional structures I poise fanlights above doors and windows . I consider the play of light on hardwood floors the richest carpet there is . <p> I hope to marry someday , but I do n't know . Dominic tells me that he is married and has three children already , two boys and a girl . He tells me that his father , who now lives with him , went out to the storeroom recently to look at the wheel . Dominic had saved it for him in case he ever decided to make pots again . He thinks it 's a good sign , that his father went out to look at it . <p> Any day now I expect to run into Dominic and hear that the wheel is turning . I can picture clay at his father 's fingertips coming alive . It gives me a good feeling , waiting for news like that . <p> Author Affiliation       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
