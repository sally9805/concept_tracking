<p> It takes Marcie Waldron only a few moments to explain the difference between men and women in the workplace . Right now , she says , she 's heading up a project at the architectural firm of DiMella Shaffer in Boston . All the members of the team are female , and when they meet , everyone takes part . They organize , parcel out responsibilities , and devise ways to check off tasks as the job progresses . Things at her old firm , though , were different . Sitting at a granite table in a meeting room overlooking Boston Harbor , she tells of one project , led by a male architect , that was a study in frustration . " Everyone would just sit around the table with their little calendars " and that 's it , she says . There was no receptivity to group planning . It 's a telling comparison , and it comes at a time when more and more evidence suggests that women make better managers than men . For years , companies wanted leaders who took control - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their goal no matter what the odds or obstacles . Business was a war game , and men were seen as the best field commanders . Today , a decade after the great wave of layoffs turned many workers into free agents with little corporate loyalty , businesses want teambuilders and communicators - people who create a relationship with employees and instill in them a commitment to the organization . Studies have repeatedly shown that this means women . To be sure , generalizations can be dangerous - no one sex has a monopoly on character traits , and some studies show little difference between how men and women manage . Yet in many others , women consistently rank higher on qualities that are of increasing importance in today 's transient workplace . While this has yet to tilt the gender balance in Fortune 500 boardrooms , it has taken hold in <p> mid-level management , and colleagues are increasingly showing their appreciation for a more-female approach . *More than 2,400 managers in 19 states rated women more highly than men in 17 of 20 leadership skills , according to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Associates in Kalamazoo , Mich . The skills included not only traits such as coaching , teamwork , and empowering employees - traditionally seen as women 's strengths - but also decisiveness and planning . *Women came out on top in 42 of 52 skills in a survey of 425 executives by Hagberg Consulting Group in Foster City , Calif. *A study of 58,000 managers by Personnel Decisions in Minneapolis gave women the advantage in 20 of 23 measures . *A survey of more than 6,400 questionnaires by Janet Irwin and Michael Perrault showed that women finished ahead in 28 of 31 management categories . " Women tend to be much more comfortable with ambiguity , sharing information , and sharing responsibility - when you have to be flexible , " says Judy Rosener , a professor at the University of California at Irvine 's Graduate School of Management . " And this flexibility is going to make women much more effective . " <p> Cultural roots of gentler style The reasons for women 's rise in the esteem of American business are intimately linked with cultural and economic factors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , the recession of the 1980s and early 1990s forced companies to downsize and become leaner . Unwieldy hierarchies were largely replaced by a more team-oriented focus . As a result , leadership has become more nurturing and inclusive . Now it 's not just unilaterally deciding who gets to collate and who gets to copy . It 's who 's got the ability to foster collaboration . " The most effective management style today is a consultative-management style , " says David Opton , founder of ExecuNet , a Norwalk , Conn. , business that helps executives manage their careers . Good leaders are " people who are effective and good listeners . " It is this quality , perhaps more than any other , that research most strongly identifies with women . Even in studies that see men and women as similar leaders , the ability to listen to and include others ' opinions stands out . In one survey of marketing executives released by Westport , Conn. - based Copernicus in 1998 , 73 percent of respondents said men make decisions without input from others , while only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's effectiveness as managers extends beyond their utility in new corporate structures . Women , many experts say , are more in tune with today 's working environment . When workers saw their fathers , uncles , aunts , and friends laid off during the economic downturn of the early 1990s - by businesses they 'd been a part of for years - priorities shifted : Life was not worth sacrificing for a paycheck . More and more , mothers wanted longer maternity leave , fathers wanted time off to be with their children , others just wanted flex time to go hiking . If they did n't get it , unemployment in recent years has been so low that they could quit and find a better job . It is an employment paradigm virtually unprecedented in modern history . " It used to be that males ran corporate America and had the attitude of ' My way or the highway . ' That 's not so anymore , " says Joyce Gioia , president of the Herman Group , a management consulting group in Greensboro , N.C. " Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out our employees . " She notes that it costs $ 85,000 in training to replace a customer-service employee who makes $ 23,000 a year . She and others say women have shown a particular adeptness at keeping employees happy . Indeed , according to the Irwin study , women 's greatest strength compared with men is responding to others ' needs . " I have seen more employees who are literally devoted to women managers than are even connected to male managers , " says Ms. Gioia . Dina Hampton might not go so far as to pledge devotion to female bosses she 's worked for , but the New York journalist says she 'd definitely rather work for a woman . " Women have a real empathy as to the special challenges women face in the marketplace , " says Ms. Hampton , an editor of the online publication Streetmail.com . The female style of leadership , however , has not been a salve for every workplace . For men and women who have grown accustomed to a more autocratic style of managing , the switch to a softer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in men - they do n't realize they 're being told what to do , " says Deborah Tannen , a linguist at Georgetown University in Washington . <p> It all began with kickball This difference in communication is something that began back in recess and continues to play a role through adulthood , says Dr. Tannen . Girls who put themselves above others , she suggests , are frowned upon , while boys are pressed to stand out and speak authoritatively to win respect . When these acculturated codes are broken , people become uneasy . A recent study by professors at Arizona State University West in Phoenix in found that employees - both male and female - were more likely to feel they were treated unfairly if disciplined by a female manager . Part of that , they surmised , was that women were seen as " overly aggressive " if they made the same points their male colleagues made . It 's a point that John Downie , a senior associate at DiMella Shaffer , agrees with . When a fellow female manager got mad at her staffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' If that were me , they would n't have thought twice about it , ' " he says . In some male-dominated settings , pressures like these have led to women becoming more man-like in their leadership . Muriel Siebert , for one , says she had two personalities . The first woman to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange , in 1967 , Ms. Siebert says she could not have succeeded without adapting to her surroundings . " It was pretty difficult , if not impossible , to keep a feminine perspective in the business world , " she says . " There were people who would have been shocked if I did n't use a four-letter-word . " From the stock exchange to the auto industry to information technology , research has shown that women have taken on more male qualities to survive . But , interestingly , a study by Marshall Sashkin at George Washington University in Washington found that women executives often reverted back to a more inclusive , nurturing style when they became owners of their own companies . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although only two of the Fortune 500 companies are run by women , there are signs of progress . In 1995 , only 25 companies had women filling one-quarter of the corporate officer positions , according to the New York-based research organization Catalyst . By last year , the number had doubled . <p> Craig Savoye contributed to this report . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
