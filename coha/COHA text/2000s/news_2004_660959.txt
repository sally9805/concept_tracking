<p> Sadr enters the mosque at Kufa where he 's led Friday prayers for nearly a year denouncing the authorities and warning of an " imperialist " conspiracy against Iraq 's majority Shiites . <p> The thousands fill the vast open courtyard , chanting the name of their hero when he strides through the gate , and they take up his call during the sermon . " No , no to America ! No , no to Israel ! No , no to imperialism ! " In Baghdad , the authorities worry about how to handle this militant cleric , his rising profile and his willingness to flex the street muscle he 's built up in Iraq 's slums . <p> But the Sadr in question is not Moqtada , the young cleric whose gunmen now occupy Kufa and the neighboring shrine city of Najaf . Instead , the year is 1998 and the man leading the prayers is Ayatollah Mohammed Sadek Al-Sadr , Moqtada 's father . <p> While Moqtada 's religious credentials are weak , his family 's political standing is as deep as the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1932 . And this young , militant cleric did n't spontaneously emerge after the fall of Saddam Hussein . US forces now entering the city of Najaf , are up against a man who has donned the well-cultivated mantle of his father , the leading Shiite thorn in the side of the Hussein regime in the 1990s . <p> Today , the younger Sadr has built on his father 's popularity and created a militant Shiite movement that has eclipsed many in the more moderate Shiite majority , who have remained largely silent . <p> For the moment , his movement is stalled . The uprising he sparked across southern Iraq in early April has failed . But the ability of a fairly junior cleric to defy the US-led coalition is a sign of how difficult Iraq 's political transition is about to become . <p> In his sermon last Friday , Moqtada threatened to use suicide attackers against US forces if they try to root him out of Najaf . Monday , as 1,000 Spanish forces withdrew , 200 US troops moved onto a base in Najaf three miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seen as a way to keep a foothold in the city , controlled by Sadr 's forces . <p> For his supporters , the stand-off with the Americans is evidence that he 's on the right path . " The tyrants always fear the ones who are most just , must good , " says Ali Yassawi , sitting in the movement 's main office in Sadr City , the sprawling Baghdad public housing quarter that is a hot-bed of Saddriyun , or Sadr supporters . " At first I was n't sure about Moqtada , but just like the father , our enemies are fighting against him . This proves he 's on the right path . " <p> Reverence for martyrdom <p> Fighting and dying for near hopeless causes inspires almost mystical reverence within the Shiite community , going back to the beginnings of the Sunni- Shiite split in the 7th century . When Imam Ali was assassinated after leaving the mosque in Kufa where he had set up a rival caliphate , his son Hussein later led 72 men into battle against an army of 4,000 opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Moqtada refers to the US as " Yazid , " the name of the Ummayid Caliph whose men killed Imam Hussein , and talks about the martyrdom of both his own father and his uncle , the prominent Ayatollah and philosopher Mohammed Bakr al-Sadr , killed by the Hussein regime in 1980 . His framing of the conflict in these terms has made it difficult for the US to deal with Sadr , a man US officials have charged with murder . <p> " The idea of martyrdom and persecution does resonate throughout the Shiite world , " says David Patel , a PhD candidate at Stanford University in California who 's studying Shiite political movements in modern Iraq . " The average Shiite is unlikely to empathize with Moqtada 's plight , probably thinking he brought it on himself . " But Patel says that if US forces move on Najaf , Sadr 's support could blossom . <p> Though it may appear as if Sadr came out of nowhere , he 's employed a philosophy of total opposition , and the means to carry out , inherited from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now stands against the US , their oppositionist position has always had one objective : To bring the rule of wilayat al faqih , or the rule of the jurisprudent , to Iraq , patterned after Iran 's theocracy . " In difficult situations like the ones we faced under the regime of Saddam Hussein , people will always look for leaders who stand up for their rights , " says Imam Hazim al-Araji , a cleric close to Moqtada . " The Sadr line showed themselves to be the ones willing to stand up to the regime , and suffered for it . The people really respect this . " <p> With a ruthless campaign of assassinations , Hussein had cowed most of the Shiite clergy in the 1990s , with major regime opponents in exile . The hawza , the senior Shiite leadership and seminary teachers in Najaf , were silenced . <p> Sadek courted by Hussein <p> Mohammed Sadek al-Sadr 's rise to prominence was an unconventional one . Close aides to Moqtada say the regime approached the father in the early 1990s and even steered funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shiite sentiment that had flared in the 1991 uprisings after the Gulf War . Though the Shiites make up about 60 percent of Iraq 's population , they have never held power . <p> Under the cloak of Hussein 's " Faith Campaign " in the early years of the decade , which was designed to recast the secular Iraqi dictator as a defender of Islam , Sadek al-Sadr sent emissaries throughout the center and south of the country , building up a network of clerics with similar ideas . But he did n't stay loyal to the Hussein government . By about 1995 , he began calling for the resumption of Friday prayers , which had been mostly banned by the Hussein regime except in mosques controlled by clerics loyal to the government . <p> " The regime was afraid of internal opposition so they were looking for a cleric they could control , " says Jawad al-Khalasi , a cleric with extensive contact with Moqtada 's network . " They thought Sadek al-Sadr was perfect , that he was weak and easily controlled . But he tricked them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a militant tone . He began to define the domestic Shiite clergy as split into two camps - the " speaking hawza " represented by him and clerics close to him and the " silent hawza " led by Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani and others , who spent the last decade of Hussein 's regime under house arrest and who eschewed overtly political statements . <p> Sadek al-Sadr , who studied Islamic law with Iran 's future leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini while the latter was exiled to Najaf , indirectly attacked clerics like Sistani in his sermons , saying their silence on political issues lent indirect support to the regime . <p> Sistani belongs to a Shiite camp that worries that involvement in politics can contaminate religious purity . This view is sharply at odds with men like Ayatollah Khomeini , who believe that only senior clerics are fit to rule . Both the elder and the younger Sadr have also attacked Ayatollah Sistani for being an Iranian by birth , and thus lacking their commitment to Iraqi national issues , though their criticisms ignore their ties to other Iranian clerics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tribal networks and the urban poor - and these efforts looked to Hussein as if Sadr was seeking to build his own power base . <p> By 1999 , Sadek al-Sadr was openly attacking Hussein 's rule . He called for Shiites to stop making direct donations to the Shiite clergy , since he said some of the money was being diverted to the regime for use on " women and liquor . " <p> According to a 1999 book on Sadek al-Sadr by Adil Rauf and cited in a paper by Juan Cole , a US expert on Iraq 's Shiites , Sadr senior issued a fatwa saying it was acceptable to kill Baathist " persecutors . " <p> This all proved too much for the regime . On Feb.18 , 1999 , the car carrying Sadek al-Sadr home to Najaf was riddled with bullets in an ambush , and he was killed along with two of his four sons . Most of his supporters believe Sadr survived the initial attack and was later finished off at a Najaf hospital . <p> The killing caused brief uprisings denouncing Hussein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ruthlessly suppressed by Hussein 's internal security forces , who killed an estimated 200 people in two days of fighting . <p> Emmad Sejad , a Mahdi army fighter who participated in the 1999 Sadr City uprising says Hussein 's forces fired continuously into the crowd , killing about 60 people , including women and children . He says the incident confirmed his support for the Sadr family . " They are all born to be martyrs , the line of the Sadrs is a revolutionary line . And we share the same vision : To bring a proper Islamic government to Iraq . " <p> Moqtada , who 's variously described as 31 or 33 years old , took control of his father 's organization , going underground to build a network of clandestine cells with the goal of overthrowing the Hussein regime and establishing a Shiite theocracy . <p> Sadek al-Sadr had left instructions for his followers to take religious instruction from Kazim al-Hairi , a cleric based in the Iranian shrine city of Qom . But on April 8 , 2003 , Hairi issued a fatwa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Moqtada and to ignore the US occupation , urging the Shiites to take power for themselves . <p> US officials have been consistently surprised by the virulence of Moqtada 's supporters and his willingness to promote his aims through violence . The US seemed to be unaware of his militant movement before the invasion in Iraq . In a National Public Radio interview on Feb. 18 , 2003 , Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz played down the potential for an militant Shiite religious movement . <p> " The Iraqis are ... by and large quite secular . They are overwhelmingly Shia ... they do n't bring the sensitivity of having the holy cities of Islam being on their territory , " Mr. Wolfowitz said . <p> But it did n't take long for Moqtada to attract US attention . On April 7 , two days before the official fall of Baghdad to US-led forces , Sadr 's supporters rose up in Saddam City , raiding police stations and weapons stockpiles . By April 9 , they 'd renamed the 2 million-strong district Sadr City after Mohammed Sadek al-Sadr . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic jurisprudence , began his own Friday sermons . <p> " Sadr has called us out to protect Najaf . The Americans have no intention of ever leaving Iraq , " says Jaffar al-Musawi , a Sadr militiaman lounging with a group of gunmen near the Shrine of Ali in Najaf , which the Sadr movement now controls , including the donations that flow to it from pilgrims . <p> But Sadr 's men have also turned their sights on other targets , most specifically their domestic Shiite political opponents . US officials say Sadr was behind the murder of Abdel Majid al-Khoei in Najaf last April . Imam Khoei was close to the US , and had returned from exile with US funding to win supporters in Najaf . After Khoei 's muder , Sadr militiamen surrounded the house of Sistani , who was briefly forced into hiding . <p> These incidents demonstrate Sadr 's long-term aims go far beyond simply getting the US to leave Iraq . " What 's happening now has more to do with the dynamics between Sistani and Sadr than it does between either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
