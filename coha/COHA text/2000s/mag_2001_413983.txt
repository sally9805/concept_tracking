The Southwest desert wonderland is at last getting the attention it deserves . Hike , drive , enjoy it now // THE SONORAN Desert DAWN announces its arrival with the sound of a thousand stirrings . It breaks a silence so complete that you might think nothing short of a sonic boom could dent it . Sure , coyotes howled during the night , their yips and yowls bouncing off the mountains and across the valley . Owls screeched and bats fluttered above our campsite in the Table Wilderness Area in south-central Arizona , about 20 miles off U.S. 8 . But the silence of the night always closed back in , reinforcing the illusion of emptiness common to deserts . The rising sun , still beneath the horizon , begins to light the morning , gradually repainting the sky shade-by-shade and minute-by-minute : from gray to pink to violet on its way to a cloudless midday blue . Photograph Desert sentinels , Sonoran , Desert 's signature saguaros rise at Saguaro National Park West , near Tucson . Photograph // The breeze picks up almost imperceptively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It carries with it a hint of moisture from the light dew that settled , seemingly incongruously , over the desert during the night . The wind rustles the brittlebush and whispers its way though the clustered needles of saguaros , the hallmark cactus of the Sonoran Desert . High on a 40-foot saguaro , a Gila woodpecker insistently calls as it flits about from branch to branch . Whitewinged doves coo , and a whiptail lizard scurries across the gravel . The spindly , 15-foottall branches of the ocotillo , bare and dead-looking things under dry conditions , are fully leafed out ; bees and hummingbirds sip from the tubular red flowers that blossom at the tips . The sweet melodies of songbirds-curvebilled thrashers and native sparrows-play off the low buzz . The morning surge lasts maybe an hour , but it stays with you much longer . Any notion of the Sonoran Desert as empty , a wasteland , is forever shattered in this first waking moment , to be replaced by an understanding that this is a kind of dryland Eden . As David Yetman , a research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , describes these mornings , " There is no more glorious time or place in the world . " The desert different The Sonoran Desert stretches some 120,000 square miles from its Arizona heartland into Southern California and Mexico . It includes not only wellknown spots , such as Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and Saguaro National Park , but also lesser-known areas on its fringes , like the Nature Conservancy 's Ramsey Canyon Preserve , a wooded , watered enclave that hardly seems desertlike . In fact , while the saguaro is the dominant image , the desert actually consists of six distinct plant communities , from vast creosote seas to hidden palm canyons two hours outside of Los Angeles . It is a rich environment . Half of North America 's bird species , 500 in all , are found here . There are 130 mammal species , including the endangered Sonoran pronghorn and even scattered jaguars . There are 5,000 plants , including 3,500 native species . Look hard enough and you may find 20 amphibian and 30 fish species , in larger streams and tiny oases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and a voluptuous profusion of saguaro blossoms ( right ) . // Yet the Sonoran Desert has been misunderstood . " When people go out to a desert , they normally start itemizing what is missing , " says Tucson-based writer Charles Bowden . " What happens over time is they cease to think something is missing . There 's no absence in the desert . It 's the place where the clutter of life is removed and you can finally see . " To Bowden and many other desert denizens , the Sonoran Desert is a paradise-not a word usually used to describe deserts . Indeed , at certain times and in certain places , it can be one of Earth 's harshest places . A single , careless misstep can lead to a long , agonizing afternoon of plucking cholla needles from your legs . There are scorpions , tarantulas , rattlesnakes , and the Gila monster , one of the two poisonous lizard species in the world . The other-the beaded lizard-also happens to live here . Photograph Photograph A spare world of surpassing beauty : ocotillos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cactus National Monument ( top right ) , and spring poppies ( below right ) . // Even with two separate rainy seasons ( winter and the furious summer monsoons ) that make the Sonoran Desert 's upland areas the world 's lushest desert , evaporation outpaces rainfall 10 to 1 . Some sections can go years without rain , and springs are almost nonexistent. in places , the bones of travelers who tried to traverse this expanse more than a century ago may still be bleaching under a sun that has shone here almost every day since . It seems a dangerous place , and sometimes it is . But as Bowden says : " Historically , we have a negative image of the desert that comes from the Bible itself And we are creatures of water in an evolutionary sense . At first we have an unconscious discomfort with and environments . We worry about becoming desiccated . But there are far more hospitable days in a year in the Sonoran Desert than there are in Yellowstone National Park . " A paradise threatened Paradise , almost by definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no exception . With Arizona 's population at 5 million and growing , urbanization has encroached upon pristine areas around Phoenix and Tucson . As Arizonans turn to the desert for recreation , a careless minority scars the land by taking vehicles off-road . Others , ironically , traffic in saguaros and other cactus destined for new suburban gardens . The fragile biology is also threatened by invasive plant species , such as the aggressive African import buffelgrass , which pushes out native plants and increases fire danger . The Sonoran Desert is uniquely vulnerable to such pressures . It does not recover quickly . To give some perspective on the desert 's time frame , it takes a saguaro 10 years to grow its first 1 1/2 inches . Photograph // Nor is the complexity of the Sonoran Desert or the interaction of its species fully understood . When you stop and marvel at the burst of activity of a Sonoran dawn , you are also witnessing the intricate workings of an ecosystem in operation . At the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum , researchers are looking at the migration patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moths , and bats that plants such as saguaros depend on to spread their pollen and reproduce . It is a case of mutualism , says Rick Daley , the museum 's executive director . " If bats stop migrating , you do n't have saguaros . If you do n't have saguaros , all the other animals and plants that depend on them will disappear , " he says . " These organisms are critical to the whole environment , but we hardly know anything about their real patterns . " A once-in-a-nation opportunity n the face of development pressures , there are growing grassroots and government attempts to provide the Sonoran Desert with additional protections . Pima County 's Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan seeks to balance development with habitat protection for such creatures as the endangered ferruginous pygmy-owl . More ambitious is a citizen proposal to create a 5,000-squaremile Sonoran Desert National Park . The park would include such existing federal lands as Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument , Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge , and the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range . More than 1.1 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Pinacate Biosphere Reserve in Mexico , such a national park would create an ecological preserve of global significance . Bowden and his longtime hiking buddy , author Bill Broyles , have been instrumental in creating the proposal . Bowden says that for all the development pressures on the Sonoran Desert , there is still plenty left to save . " It 's not just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . It 's a once-in-anation opportunity , " says Bowden . The Sonoran Desert National Park would n't be a national park in the classic sense . With its 360 perspectives and foreboding expanses , this desert does n't lend itself to easy postcard tourism . Still the ephemeral display of its full wildflower glory-those rare times when poppies , lupines , and owl-clover spread a blanket of golds and purples across the land-is as spectacular as anything to be found in the national park system . An important part of the Sonoran Desert experience is its vastness and the knowledge that a place so unspoiled still exists . Humans have long sought the mystical in the desert , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere and even on a driving loop in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument . We found it among the saguaros and palo verdes of the Table Top Wilderness Area-in the middle of nothing and at the center of everything . " Whenever I 'm out in the Sonoran , at first I 'm overwhelmed by its immensity , " says Bowden . " By the time I leave , I 'm chilled that it 's too small . Its sense of peace should be available everywhere . At first the idea that there 's not going to be a human for another 40 miles is frightening . Then it becomes the greatest comfort in your life .
