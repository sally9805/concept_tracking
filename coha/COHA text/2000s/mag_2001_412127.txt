WHO NEEDS GLOBAL CAPITALISM ? REVOLUTION IS JUST A CLICK AWAY <p> Rain casts a gray pall over the red and yellow leaves hanging down outside my window . There is a fog over the small lake , and the beautiful , fiery colored hillside opposite is grayed , too . Cold autumn in the mountains of central Quebec . Inside , a fire is blazing . I 'm sitting at the dining room table , drinking ten-year-old Scotch . Dvorak 's New World Symphony is playing from my laptop 's CD player as I stare at the screen , doing like so many young people these days . I 'm looking for a riot . Just an Internet connection away . <p> Google , Yahoo , Alta Vista  --  use whatever search engine you like : type in P-R-O-T-E-S-T , and up pops Protest .

This is a call for a mass mobilization against these killers . Shut them down . <p> Riot potential : are you kidding ? <p> This is a new notice . The Ottawa meeting was just announced today . The protest show is already being planned . Just a couple of hours down the road . Welcome to the brave new world . THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS <p> We all know you can buy a car on the Internet , manage your company 's inventory , and e-mail streaming video of the kids to relatives . Someone told me you can gamble and find pornography out there . But that 's all so 1999 . Nortel Networks has been running ads that ask , " What do you want the Internet to be ? " To an increasing number of angry young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a global war against the State , the greedy capitalist elite , the transnational sweatshop overlords , the Frankenfood manufacturers , the despoilers of the environment , the tramplers of indigenous rights , the billion dollar pimps of the world . And built , of course , by the very same greedy , trampling , destroying , transnational elite . But what 's globalization for ? <p> " We will rise up and seize the means of communication ! " as Protest . Net 's " About Us " section puts it . In fact , activists of all stripes  --  left , right and crazy  --  have been madly e-mailing , running listservs , tending antique servers and building Web sites for years . But the fresh-faced , pierced , maximally trendy global anti-globalization movement has taken Net activism to what Silicon Valley-ites call " the next level . " Since the now-famous 1999 " Battle of Seattle "  --  Bill Gates ' home turf !  --  the movement has ratcheted up its numbers , its impact and its profile on the Internet , making each new " action " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their agenda is no secret : tear down the world economic apparati . Free trade ? It 's a " race to the bottom "  --  sweatshops , ravaged landscapes , all in a bid to attract greedy investors . The WTO ? A secretive , un-elected threat to national sovereignty . World Bank ? Global loan shark . Genetically modified crops ? Goodbye family farmers , if not the entire human race . <p> So where did the love come from between socialists , human rights activists , Buchananites , church groups , United Students Against Sweatshops , the Green Party , Queers Against Corporate Globalization , Anarchist People of Color , the AFL-CIO and every other species of turtle-saver , tree-hugger and monkey-wrencher ? Where did they all meet , the laundromat ? How did so many tens of thousands come to travel to the big Shows in Seattle , Quebec City , Prague and Genoa ? Was there free beer ? In a movement that is proudly non-hierarchical , disorganized , and discordant , the Internet is the toothpick holding together the protest Club sandwich . FROM RONALD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists have a home-field advantage  --  way ahead of the corporations and governments they attack , and the law enforcement agencies trying to track them . <p> The potential for connecting technology and protest first became apparent in 1994 , when the Zapatista rebels burst onto the world stage from the jungles of the impoverished southern Mexican province of Chiapas . Zapatistas communiques spread like digital fire across the Net . Their leader , Subcommandante Marcos , writing in a bizarre mix of Shakespeare , Kafka and Mao , became a ' global resistance ' hero , an emblem for would-be revolutionaries everywhere . By linking the Mexican Indian rights with the fight against NAFTA  --  then just going into effect  --  Marcos gained sympathy with labor unions and environmentalists north of the Rio Grande . Mostly using e-mail , sympathizers began to organize around the world , demonstrating at Mexican embassies and consulates , pressing the Zapatistas ' demands . The Grand Alliance was born . <p> Landmark number two : on February 16 , 1996 , two London activists launch the McSpotlight website . McDonald 's , the restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Ronald literature . The company was spending whatever it took to agressively press their case  --  the longest in English history by the time it dragged to an end . The activists used a tiny office and a few computers to spread their story worldwide . Suddenly they had sympathetic pro bono lawyers , researchers to dispute every McDonald 's claim , a fundraising conduit and their own dedicated army of demonstrators . As Keith McHenry , co-founder of the WHERE-based group Food Not Bombs , later put it : " Every where I went in Europe I could attend a protest against McDonald 's . I thought that was convenient . " In the first month , the McSpotlight site received a million hits . McDonald 's won a token settlement . The movement saw what it could do . <p> The same year saw the formation of San Francisco-based CorpWatch , dedicated to holding corporate feet to the fire on issues of human rights , labor rights and environmental justice . " This was also the official ' Year of the Sweatshop ' , when Kathie Lee Gifford cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site , CorpWatch began monitoring previously obscure labor conflicts in places like the Philippines and Indonesia . Back home it could call out protests overnight against the U.S. parent companies  --  Nike , Disney , The Gap . It was cool stuff , genuine innovation  --  global dot.com politics . Unions , environmentalists , church and student groups all joined in . <p> Then in 1998 came the next logical step : a portal just for protest . Evan Henshaw-Plath ( nom de Net " Rabble-Rouser " ) had developed an Internet-based calendar tool in college , and got some venture capital funding to develop it . Just what you needed , some activist friends suggested , for keeping abreast of the global protest world . And so was born Protest . Net , an activist collective supported by donations solicited online , 87,000 events served ( and counting ) . As the site announces : <p> Every day from Kansas to India , activists are meeting , organizing , and protesting to demand a better world for all . When the corporate media takes note of our activities it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being misinformed bleading , heart hooligans with nothing better to do than march up and down blocking traffic ... Activists around the world are fighting for a better world . We ca n't rely on the media establishment to cover our movements . We will rise up and seize the means of communication ! <p> New-media Bolsheviks in their twenties and thirties are the engine of this new uber-movement . They get out the troops to bolster the Teamsters and other unions , and forge the links between the various protest streams . To young activists , surfing the Web and building sites comes as easily as making placards or chanting slogans . Geek expertise and skills are shared via e-mail . Server space is cheap : organizations such as TAO.ca and riseup.net provide it free for other groups , who may be physically located on the other side of the world ( or have no physical location at all ) . As the Webmaster of one protest group told me , " The Internet might be serving capitalism , but it 's serving the interests of the subversives too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE G8 <p> Clicking on the anti-EU notice on protest.net , I come to the Brussels-based site D14.be ( " D " for December ) . The banner shows a yellowed silhouette of a boy ( possibly Calvin , of Calvin &; Hobbes ) urinating on an EU flag . Sites such as this show the full power of the Internet as a propaganda medium cum travel service cum organizing tool . Oh , and nightlife directory . Here 's how it works : <p> As soon as a protest-worthy official meeting is announced , an activist group in the host city launches a dedicated site , which functions as the umbrella organization for any and all interested protest groups . The site includes travel resources  --  bus and train schedules , carpool lists from various points of departure , and links to out-of-town student and other groups organizing buses into the city . Housing options  --  typically local colleges , churches and private homes  --  are all coordinated on the site . There are maps of the city , including details of expected police cordons and barricades , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are schedules  --  marches , concerts , teach-ins , protest training  --  and info on free legal collectives ( you 'll want to get arrested ) , independent media ( nothing that might upset your fixed ideas ) , and food and medical facilities ( whose volunteer staffers conveniently can sign up right on-line ) . There will be tips on what to bring  --  do n't forget a vinegar-soaked bandanna , to protect from tear gas  --  and bank account numbers for making donations to the legal defense fund . Plus , of course , some suitably turgid verbiage : <p> What have neo-liberalism , globalization and privatizations brought the general population ? The people have a right to access public senses . But the European Union encourages privatisations and deregulation . The people have a right to live in peace . But the Union is creating an autonomous army . This will be able to intervene anywhere , either because the market economy is not master of the situation or because the economic interests of the big multinationals consider that their interests are in danger . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people . <p> Obviously . THE DAILY RANT : ALL THE NEWS THAT FITS OUR SERVERS <p> The activist groups themselves can be just as free-form . As one organizer said , " We 're not like some tight group with t-shirts . " Life on the Web sustains the movement in the off-season with gleefully partisan news sites and discussion forums . The Internet is a low-cost paradise for views under-represented in mainstream media  --  left , right and modes of thought that do n't fit any spectrum . Anti-globalization activists make it a particular point of spurning anything with the faintest whiff of a profit motive or commercial interest . TV stations and most newspapers are beyond the pale ; they 're owned by large corporations , the prime agents of global mayhem . Since corporate media ( a favorite term ) is not to be trusted , activists rely on their own news sources , most of them online and conveniently linked from both specific protest sites and larger portals like Protest . Net . " All media is biased , " an activist told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would do it with media that does n't serve capitalist interests . " <p> I take a pull on my Scotch and type www.commondreams.org  --  the number-one global source for news with a ' progressive ' slant . Common Dreams is a non-profit , funded by individuals and organizations including the World Wildlife Fund , AFL-CIO , Amnesty International , Senator Paul Wellstone , NOW , the Sierra Club , the ACLU , several Naderite groups and concerned individuals everywhere . The actual contents , culled from wire services , newspapers and magazines around the world , are a kind of " progressive " Top 40 : " Nobel Laureate Encourages Global Justice Movement : Keep It up . , " What Powerful States Call Terrorism May Be An Inevitable Response To Injustice " ; " War On The Poor And Working Class . " Naomi Klein , Arundhati Roy , Arianna Huffington , Bill Greider , Michael Moore , Ralph Nader and ( surprise ! ) Noam Chomsky  --  they 're all here . <p> But Common Dreams is too mainstream for hard-core protesters ; its writers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be trusted . Serious global citizens turn to the Seattle-based Independent Media Center , best known by its URL , indymedia.org . Anyone can post here . During this summer 's marches in Washington , " guerrilla " journalist Dan Berger fried a report that his roommate had just called to say that their march  --  about 300 strong  --  had been surrounded by riot cops : <p> People are in high spirits  --  playing soccer , playing with puppets , hanging out . Right now , a spokes council meeting is going on to figure out what to do . There are plans to write a joint statement .... That 's all for now . I will post more as I hear it . <p> Indymedia and its satellite sites throw together a mix of serious non-mainstream journalism , conspiracy theorist rants , activist updates , manifestos , and opinions of all types . On a recent day , the site bannered : " 20,000 Criticize EU in Ghent , Belgium . " A correspondent in Chicago contributed : " The Overthrow of the American Republic , Part Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George W. Bush : America 's Number One Evildoer . " At least he 's not number two . <p> Web surfing is fun , but most of the real heavy lifting for world liberation happens on listservs . Dating back to the Net 's earliest days as a Pentagon-funded tool for dispersed scientific researchers , listservs are e-mail lists , some with hundreds or thousands of members , some with a dozen . Some are public ; they can be joined just by finding the right website . Others have to be signed up for at meetings ( that is , in real space ) . A-infos , a popular multi-lingual anarchist listserv , is a managed forum  --  anyone can sign up to receive it , but input is controlled by the a-infos cabal . Motto : " Resistance is fertile ! " Mission : " To be the people 's scribe . On the other side of history , history has begun . And it will have new authors . It kicks . And so do we . " <p> Yeah ! A-info 's often twice-daily e-mails give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Commonwealth meetings in Australia , news on squatters in Helsinki , plans for anti-poverty marches in Toronto ... my inbox runneth over . Of course , activists realize that their listservs are n't secure ; organizers assume as a matter of course that police are on the list . " You should assume the FBI or CIA know what 's going on . " Now that would be news . LET 'S HEAR FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY <p> Cyberspace is full of strange sights and people , especially when one gets away from the AOL and Yahoo 's tourist traps . The Net 's mask  --  on the Internet , no one knows you 're a Scotch-sipping Canadian conservative  --  lends itself to extroversion . One of my favorite sites is www.flagblackened.net . I 'll admit it : I 'm a sucker for anarchist rhetoric . And of course , the anarchist movement has flourished in the no-rules , no-hierarchy environment of the Net . Flag-blackened is unrivalled , both for entry-level and hardcore enemies of authority in all its myriad forms . It contains an anarchist FAQ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " What would an anarchist society look like ? " and " Is n't libertarian socialism an oxymoron ? " There are links to anarchist groups worldwide  --  the Irish Workers Solidarity Movement , Heatwave ( from Texas ) and the All City Anarchists , from Australia . For real fun , check the message boards , where anarchists argue , not just over the use of violence in protests , but other burning issues  --  " Space Travel in an Anarchistic Society " for instance : TABLE HEAVEN FORBID ! <p> Message boards are a good place to find out just how crushingly boring anti-globalists can be . But there 's also a frequent undertone of rage , even menace . It 's easy to talk big on the Internet of course , but a significant minority of protesters do actively engage in violence for some , that 's undoubtedly the main point . Take www.nologo.org . The name is a reference to Naomi Klein 's book No Logo , a kind of anti-corporate bible that pulls all the movement 's disparate threads together . It 's been translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , the Web site is accessible and inviting , with cute graphical icons representing corporate bad guys . The discussion boards are notable for , their heated debates between activists of different stripes , for example anarchists v. environmentalists and socialists . On the topic ' Creative Images Of Police Brutality In Genoa , ' I come across this exchange : <p> Re : sweeping generalizations by Lemming on Thursday August 30 @04:34AM <p> ... I totally disagree with the notion that cops and protesters are 2 sides of the same coin . They are fighting to preserve the capitalist system ; we are fighting for freedom . It 's as simple as that really . Becoming a cop is an act of betrayal to your community , and they all have to bear some kind of collective responsibility for the role that the police play in society ... It 's our right to resist their oppression using whatever means are necessary , and when they come to demonstrations with tear gas , live bullets and riot gear that sure as hell do n't mean turning the other cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 02 @05:43AM <p> reply to lemming : <p> I repeat my utmost respect for your outspoken honesty . A refreshing change from the No Logo brigade whose ambivalence and double speak about violence is destroying their case . Now a counterblast : The problem with your hardline anarchist position is that you have absolutely NO PROOF that your method works . Why should people follow your neo-religious faith without proof ? . <p> You have NO PROOF that your violent tactics will produce the freedom you passionately proclaim . <p> There is NO PROOF in human history that your brand of libertarian anarchism produces a successful and sustained libertarian society . More importantly you have NO PROOF that your ardent desire to smash the big bad bogeyman of global capitalism is anything more than a monstrous alibi for your own personal psychosis . <p> Since you have no proof in these areas you have NO RIGHT to superimpose your personal psychosis and destructive desires on protest movements concerning the environment and global justice .... respect , steveh <p> Hmmm ... <p> This problem of violence has led to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a pacifist , but you need to respect the revolutionaries ' right to smash a bank window or turn over the espresso machine in Starbucks . At the Genoa G8 protest in July , the movement suffered its first death , an Italian protester shot in the head while smashing a police car with a fire extinguisher . But if you think that attacking heavily armed riot cops might not have been the wisest possible idea , best keep the thought to yourself . " We will encourage , as much as possible , all groups who speak to the media to talk about their own actions and refrain from negatively commenting on other protesters ' actions " the Ottawa n16 World Bank site counsels . " Public condemnation in one way or another , as has happened in the past , creates more division than anything else . " <p> That 's not an isolated comment ; many of the movement 's figureheads share a similar tolerance for violence . Let me tell you about a witch . She 's a California-based pagan activist named Starhawk , a self-described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among feminists , environmentalists , anarchists and  --  of course  --  voodoo adherents . She is also , with her first novel , the recipient of the 1984 Lambda award for Best Gay and Lesbian Science Fiction . She shared her thoughts on violence in a widely posted recent essay : <p> We 're moving onto unmapped territory , creating a politics that has not yet been defined . And to do so , it might be time to leave Martin and Malcolm arguing around the dinner table with each other and Emma , Karl , Leon and all the rest , and step out into the clean night air . The debate around ' violence ' and ' nonviolence ' may itself be constricting our thinking . The term ' nonviolence ' itself does n't work well from a magical point of view . Every beginning Witch learns that you ca n't cast a spell for what you do n't want  --  that the deep aspects of our minds are unclear on the concept of ' no . ' If you tell your dog , " Rover , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Walk ! " and runs for the door . If we say ' nonviolence ' we are still thinking in terms of violence . <p> Got that ? <p> In the book Republic.com , Cass Sunstein argues that the Net 's ability to filter  --  in effect , restrict  --  what we read and who we talk to endangers the deliberative aspect of democracy , which relies on considering opinions we would not have otherwise sought . Certainly , that trend is observable in the activist Web sites . Arguments spiral deeper into radicalism , as the more hard-line bully the moderate . Although activists look down on corporate-media consumers as naive , their solution is not to open up to a more diverse range of ideas  --  it 's to insulate themselves , within the walls of a pre-fabricated ideology , and then to wage muderous debate within those carefully defined limits . The Internet realm of the activist is full of amazing characters and voices . It is a world of witches and clowns , monsters and prophets . But no free trade proponents . That would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at places like Prague and Seattle are not , of course , IP addresses or network servers but real people , from the antiquated realm known as ' real-space . ' For instance , Geneva , a Montreal-based student organizer and veteran of Seattle , Washington and Quebec , as well as smaller local protests over bio-safety . I got in touch with her through a fellow-activist friend . <p> " I 've just about eliminated mainstream media from my diet , " Geneva says . " I do n't consider what 's in a newspaper news . They 're oversimplified soundbites of complex histories , and a lot of stuff which is irrelevant to me . Is it important to me to know if a bridge fell in Arkansas ? I went to broadcast journalism school and learned ' If it bleeds , it leads . ' That 's crap . And it 's all biased by corporate media . Capitalism provides variety , not choice . " <p> At anti-global protests in Quebec city this summer Gabriel , a 23-year-old student put it this way : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private sector . The problem is , the public sector has a mandate to make decisions of the good of the people , whereas the private sector has a mandate to make decisions which are for the good of their shareholders . So , when major decisions involving people , health care or social policies , or the environment are being made , I do n't think they should be in the hands of the private sector . Chapter 11 in NAFTA has shown occasions that corporations can actually sue governments . That 's a total breakdown of democratic society . " <p> NAFTA 'S Chapter 11 is a hot topic . Its intent is to prevent governments from imposing laws that discriminate against foreign corporations . But on the tear-gassed streets and the post-action message boards , Chapter 11  --  or the WTO or the planned Multilateral Agreement on Investment  --  represents nothing less than the transference of popular democratic power to multinational companies and secretive international tribunals . There 's a right-wing version of this : NAFTA et al sacrifice national sovereignty to creeping world government . Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But anyone having fantasies of left-right radical convergence should listen to Mike , a poli-sci student from New York whom I talked to briefly during the riotous Quebec demonstrations . He told me about a recent visit to Ecuador : <p> There were just malls and fucking McDonald 's here and McDonald 's there and it 's just disgusting . We 've taken away their culture and just imposed ours basically ... God I love the smell of tear gas ! <p> So there it is , the demon behind all the diverse arguments , especially for the younger protesters : a deep-seated hatred of corporate culture . No matter that without it , they  --  and their beloved Web  --  almost certainly would not be here . Trivial  --  indeed , reactionary  --  as it may seem in a world still full of hate and hunger , the ubiquity of modern marketing has spawned a fully articulated ( well , sort of ) counter-revolution . Some have described it as the fear of looking at the moon and seeing the Pepsi logo emblazoned on it . This is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nuclear weapons . But it 's no doubt heart felt . And it makes for a generation extremely receptive to anti-corporate , anticapitalist ideas from unions , environmentalists , socialists or anarchists alike . <p> In front of their computers , with their hands on keyboards and mouse pads , real people are attached to the ideas and plans that flicker on the screen . And they may . be planning to show up in your town . Meanwhile , back inside the looking glass , there is more to be seen on the cyberscape . ZAPATISMO , BABY ! <p> Standing out in the cyberswamp of essays , e-mails and news reports , Zapatista Subcommandante Marcos is the undefeated heavyweight radical communications champ . His enigmatic political communiques outline his beefs with the Mexican government , and he has also invented a new tool , the anti-globalization allegory , with his tales of Durito the Beetle . One of his famed essays outlines seven pieces of the global jigsaw puzzle , with the 7th being " pockets of resistance " : <p> Resistance does not only exist in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Latin America , in the United States and Canada , in the Europe which belongs to the Treaty of Masstrich , in Africa , in Asia , in Oceania , the pockets of resistance multiply . Each one of them has its own history , its differences , its equalities , its demands , its struggles , its accomplishments . <p> And that in fact is exactly what the Internet is making possible . In England , environmentalists , squatters and rave kids have created a type of protest/party known as Reclaim The Streets . Alerted through the RTS Web site , thousands of partyer-activists at the appointed hour take over a busy intersection . Barricades and stereo equipment are set up , street entertainers join the crowd , and a giddy party is underway , often lasting hours or even half a day before police can remove the barricades and clear the area . <p> The first Global Street Party , coinciding with a WTO meeting in Geneva , took place in May 1998 in cities worldwide , including ( just to stick with the Bs ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England ; and Brisbane , Australia . There was an RTS in Washington in late October . Another Global Street Party is planned to mark the November 9 WTO meetings in Qatar . <p> What that belies is another of Net-based anti-globalism 's little secrets : it 's fun . Here 's an e-mail missive from the Bay Area Radical Cheerleaders : <p> Hey y ' all : Here are the words for the cheers we made up or modified on Friday . Thanks for a fun practice and too much champagne . <p> " The system does n't work no more ! /What did you say ? /I said the system pushes down the poor ! /What did you say ? /I said STOMP ! LIBERATE ! /Let 's stop the hate ! /Organize ! Peace is swell ! /RISE UP , UNITE , REBEL ! ' <p> That kind of humor is the flip side to violence in the movement 's " diversity of tactics " equation . It 's also the magic of the Net  --  something for everyone . Say , legal advice . The Oakland-based Midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials on organizing legal protection for activists during protests , and on taking complaints against police to civilian review boards . " Fifty Years Is Enough " features ready-made rants against the new world order : <p> When the International Monetary Fund and World Bank arrive in southern countries , corporate profits go up , but so do poverty and suffering . Decades of promises that just a little more " short-term " pain will bring long-term gain have exposed the IMF and World Bank as false prophets whose mission is to protect those who already control too much wealth and power . <p> So now you know .

With the Internet 's influence , and a sprinkling of that Zapatismo fairy dust , the Rebel Alliance really is more or less everywhere . One less obvious utility of the Internet is simply its ability to mark your presence in the larger world , affirming one 's existence by staking a claim in cyberspace . It allows a kid in Mississippi to believe he is working hand in hand with , labor organizers in Manila , rebels in Chiapas , squatters in Helsinki , ravers in London , anarchists in Melbourne , socialists in New York , environmentalists among the redwoods north of San Francisco .
