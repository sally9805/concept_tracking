ESSAY Headnote Some business leaders have acted badly , but that does n't mean there 's a big problem with corporate America . // When even a co-worker at MONEY forwarded one of those mass e-mails in which the acronyms of business are retranslated-CFO stands for chief fraud officer-I knee that the status of America 's corporate titans had taken a hit . But let me offer a contrasting opinion . The notion that American big business-which has Produced unimaginable wealth-has systematically failed is simplistic , at best . There are some 8,000 publicly traded companies . A couple dozen fell into the hands of confidence men . That does n't mean that Wal-Mart , Ford , Maytag , Philip Morris and Dell can no longer produce great products and sell them all over the world . Are labor unions corrupt ? After all , plenty of crooks have used the dues of hard-working Americans as personal ATM machines . Are politicians corrupt ? An abundance of elected officials have certainly helped themselves to bribes , favors and illegal contributions . Charities ? Cops ? Clergy ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples does n't undo the enormous good the great majority of honest practitioners quietly perform every day . The same is true of big business . Indeed , if any generalized group is to " blame " for our market woes , perhaps it is all of us . Human nature dictates that greed and fear battle for the soul of the investor . Throughout the ' 90s , greed won handily . Buyers of stock abandoned common sense and were rewarded for doing so-if owning one profitless pet-productsby-Internet stock was good , owning two was better . Those who raised red flags were dismissed as Cassandras and killjoys while those who promised the good times would endure became superstars . In my opinion , the most tempting prize for CEOs was market dominance . The captains of industry did their best to swallow their peers and grow through buying rather than building . The endgame could not have been more clear : Left with little to buy , no one knew how to manage . Investors now speak of a " double whammy " consisting of Sept. 11 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're unrelated events . Not so . When Americans became scared-first by the slowing economy and-then by terrorists crashing planes into buildings- they began to stop suspending disbelief about everything , including optimistic assessments from corporations and their lapdog analysts . As fear seized the upper hand , it dawned on us that-oh my gosh-it really is n't possible to double earnings every year simply through acquisitions . No manager is so brilliant that he can wring enormous untapped value from both home burglar alarms and financing units . To use the great subjectless Reaganism , mistakes were made . But the current panic resembles every one that 's preceded it-in fact , it 's so predictable , it 's a commentary on the lack of human imagination . Read about the English stock market circa 1720 and substitute Enron " for " South Sea Company , " and you 'll see how little has changed . So , yes , we bought in , we went along for the ride . Now we 're paying the price . We should n't be surprised or be wringing our hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on with it . not expect multiples to continue to expand . Once again , though , we 'll give the last word on this to Peter Lynch . " Your original question does n't grab me , " he says , " because when I look at a stock at $12 , I do n't care whether four years ago it was $6 or $30 . I just care whether it 's attractive at $12 . " In other words , becoming fixated on what an investment used to be worth is a backward-looking loser 's game . The money that 's gone is gone , and there 's nothing you can do about it . Better , then , to focus on where your investments are now-and find whatever the best opportunities are for the future . - JON BIRGER WHO CAN YOU TRUST ? In today 's market , we 've learned , a little trust can be a dangerous thing . Investors trusted analysts even though 75% of their ratings were " buy . ' We trusted auditors even though accountants almost never publicly criticize their clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shareholders ' long-term interests even though executives ' options-laden pay packages gave them the incentive to think short term . With so many conflicts out there , putting all your faith in a single person or source is a recipe for financial disaster . That said , if you understand the conflicts inherent in the advice business-and if you accept that every prognosticator is going to make his or her share of blunders-then there are voices worth listening to . Even in the much maligned world of Wall Street analysts . To get an accurate assessment of which analysts are best at picking stocks-and thus most worthy of investors ' trust-we asked Wall Street data firm Starmine to rank the returns of Walls Street analysts with at least five years ' experience . Starmine created model portfolios for every analyst , treating buy ratings as long positions , hold ratings as cash positions and sell ratings as shorts . And in order to make the com parison apples to apples , Starmine evaluated ana lysts ' returns relative to sector benchmarks and then ranked analysts by how much they out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 2002 . So who fared best ? Not surprisingly , the Street 's best analysts turned out to be virtual unknowns . The analyst with the best stockpicking record was Carol Coale , a utilities analyst with Prudential Securities . Coale- , who got a smattering of press last October for the " sell " she put on Enron-was followed by Jim Parker , an airline analyst with Raymond James ; Bryan Maher , a lodging and real estate analyst with Credit Lyonnais ; and Gary Gordon , a bank analyst with UBS Warburg . Not one of these four are considered Wall Street stars , nor are they employed by firms with heavy investment banking business . Coale , Gordon , Maher and .. Parker all told MONEY  --  that they are quick to downgrade when problems arise or when recommended stocks reach their target prices . So what are these ace stock pickers recommending today ? Coale is bearish on most of her sector right now , but one stock she does like a lot is Equity Resources ( EQT ) , an Appalachian natural gas company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . Parker 's favorite name is Ryanair ( RYAAY ) , at $30- " the Southwest Airlines of Europe , " he says . Maher 's top lodging pick is Hilton Hotels ( HU ) , a stock he believes is both cheap , at $11 , and well positioned for an economic recovery . Gordon 's top pick is mortgage investor Freddie Mac ( FRE ) , which he believes has been unfairly tarnished by questions surrounding its financial disclosure practices , and trades at $56 . If what you 're looking for is big-picture insight into the market and economy , not stock picks , our advice is to bypass traditional Wall Street research altogether and click over to the monthly commentaries of Pimco bond fund manager Bill Gross at www pimco.com . Gross ' prose is virtually jargon-free , filled with interesting personal anecdotes that illuminate even the most complicated topics . And he readily admits when his forecasts have been wrong . While his commentaries are generally geared toward bond investors , equity investors would be wise to pay attention . Last March , Gross ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharp sell-off in GE stock . In July he noted how , after flubbing Enron , credit-rating agencies have been looking at bond prices for early warning signs of trouble . Aware of this , he wrote , hedge funds are shorting low-investment-grade debt in hopes of spurring downgrades . The strategy can be devastatingly successful because many institutions can not own junk , and their selling drives bond prices still lower-threatening the companies ' very survival . - JON BIRGER WITH ALL THE LOBBYING BY BIG BUSINESS , WHO 'S LOOKING OUT FOR THE SMALL INVESTOR ? The recent rash of corporate scandals may make it seem that the market is run by insiders for their own benefit-at the expense of the individual investor . But consider this : Even the largest , most sophisticated investors were blindsided . For example , the California Public Employees Retirement System ( Calpers ) lost more than $500 million on its WorldCom investments alone , and New York State 's pension fund lost about $300 million . As a result , institutional investors are now pushing hard for market reforms , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auditing and accounting for stock options as an expense-all of which can only benefit the small investor in the long run . During the leveraged-buyout binge in the late ' 80s , activist public pension funds such as Calpers and TIAA-CREF were instrumental in persuading companies to open up their boards to independent directors and to drop poison-pill provisions that protected management at the expense of shareholders . With the latest crisis , institutional investors have once again stepped up their efforts , and more pension fund managers have joined the cause . In July , for example , the state treasurers in New York , North Carolina and California-collectively controlling $370 billion in pension assets-threatened to pull business from investment banks and money managers that do not take steps to avoid conflicts of interest by brokers and fund managers . Even private institutional investors , who have generally been reluctant to go public with grievances , are beginning to speak up . Well-known fund managers , including Bill Miller of Legg Mason Value and Chris Davis of Selected American , among others , have gone on record to declare their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what pension funds can accomplish , given the slow pace of change at the corporate level . One of their main tools , for example , is the proxy vote . But proxies coming out of today 's scandals generally wo n't be voted on until 2003 ; by that time , if the Enron and WorldCom scandals fade , there will be less public pressure for change . Meantime , there are plenty of powerful interests seeking to stall reforms ; lobbyists for hightech firms recently forced Calpers to table a resolution that would have pressured companies to count stock options as expenses . Still , given that institutional investors collectively hold , by some estimates , more than 50% of the $12 trillion in publicly traded securities , their concern over their losses wo n't subside anytime soon-and their reform efforts will be impossible for companies to ignore . As a result , institutional investors will continue to be one of the most powerful forces for fairer markets .

" In the end , the best watchdogs are the investors themselves . ' - PENELOPE.WANG . Sidebar TECH RECOVERY ?
