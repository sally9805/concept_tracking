INTRODUCTION // For those of you who think beauty is about mirrors , makeup , and how many pudding packs you have to sacrifice to fit into your skinny jeans , then pull up a chair , postpone your top-of-the-hour Botox appointment , and hear this . // Beauty is n't some vapid and superficial pursuit that exists solely to sell products , wag tongues , and produce drool . Beauty is actually precisely perceived , purposeful , and rooted more in hard science than in abstract and random opinion . From the time we started prancing around the world with our body-hair parkas and leafy lingerie , evolution has pushed us to be more beautiful . And that 's why beauty serves as the foundation for our feelings , our happiness , and our existence . In fact , beauty does n't reflect our vanity as much as it does our humanity . // Beauty  --  dear appearance-obsessed friend  --  is health . // We already know that beauty is always on your mind , because it 's on everyone 's minds . You ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not  --  every time you step in the shower or in front of the mirror . It drives many of the decisions you make about exercise and eating , and it determines how you choose between the black dress and the white pants . // This kind of traditional beauty  --  the outer kind  --  really is n't just about looking good . Outer beauty serves as a proxy of how healthy you are ; it 's the message you send to others about your health . Way back when  --  before we could decode your genome , use fertility tests to see when you 're ovulating , and order MRIs to see what was going on with your liver  --  people used beauty as the serious assessment of the potential health of a partner . Beauty was the best way to figure it out ( and in a tenth of a second , mind you ) . Now , if you take the concept of beauty a few steps deeper , you realize that inner beauty  --  the idea of feeling good and being happy  --  also has tremendous health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 've had it all wrong . We 've thought of beauty as nonessential and superficial . Just look at our most popular beauty-based clich ? s : // Beauty is in the eye of the beholder . Translation : Just as we all have different taste buds , we all have different beauty buds , as well . Some like blond ; some like brown . Some like their men to wear boxers ; others prefer leopard-print Gstrings. // Do n't judge a book by its cover . Translation : Do n't make assumptions or judgments about people just because they have big boobs , no hair , or a belt that 's longer than a circus tightrope . // Beauty is only skin deep . Translation : Stop linking outer beauty with the inner kind . They 're as separate as mashed potatoes and maple syrup. // The logic behind all these myths argues that external beauty is unimportant , most likely misleading , and at best relevant only until more useful information becomes available . But we have three words for these three clich ? s : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that these popular principles are more myth than reality . // In fact , research shows that human beings have evolved universal standards of beauty , both within and across cultures . Research also shows that attractive people are judged more positively than unattractive people  --  even when there 's other information available about them . The data show that more attractive people are judged to be better liked , more competent , and more exciting ( all by about a two-to-one margin ) . Research also indicates that external beauty is linked to personality and behavior. // Though there are biological and social influences on beauty , it does seem that being deemed attractive creates a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy that reinforces and internalizes certain behaviors and self-concepts . And guess what ? Most of these crucial factors are ones you can change for the better . // In YOU : Being Beautiful , we 're going to share with you the biology of beauty , as well as what you can do to be your most beautiful self by making choices and taking actions that will help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel and be the way you want . // We 're going to clarify what beauty really is  --  and give you the tools to become healthier and happier by paying a little more attention to it . How ? We 're going to chop up beauty into three distinct pieces  --  pieces that will give you a perspective that may change the way others view you and , ultimately , the way you view the world . These three hunks serve as the structural outline for this book . // Part 1 : // LOOKING BEAUTIFUL : You do n't have to be a screen star to know that outer beauty matters . Simply , appearance is the proxy  --  the instant message to others  --  for youth , fertility , and health . In this section , we 'll explore some of the ways that you can improve your looks when it comes to such things as your skin , your hair , and your body shape . Most of all , these things are important because how you look partly helps determine how you feel . // Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our minds that looking like diamonds does n't mean squat if you feel like a wooden nickel . You can have the best hair , skin , and butt this side of Kalamazoo , but if you lack energy or your knees creak or you 're sadder than a leashed kitty , then all the outward magnetism you may have will be obscured  --  and fade fast . Here we 'll take a look at the big things that can keep you from feeling beautiful  --  things like fatigue and chronic pain and destructive attitudes  --  so you can help turn the blues into , well , hot pinks or purples . // Part 3 : // BEING BEAUTIFUL : Though you may assume that we 'd be imposing morality in a section about " being beautiful , " we 're not really talking about behaviors here . We 're not here to tell you what 's right and wrong but to explain how to take your life one step deeper  --  to find a more authentic and happier you in your life and relationships  --  and how to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these three kinds of beauty is that they 're all tied together : Looking as good as you like helps you feel good about yourself , which serves as the foundation for developing that sense of authenticity and deeper purpose that so many of us crave as we search for meaning in our lives . Plus , being authentic and happier makes you physically more attractive . // Now , let 's get one thing straight so you can relax a bit . You would n't be here unless your ancestors were beautiful . You need to accept the fact that we 're all beautiful ; sexual selection guaranteed it , because your ancestors mated with the most beautiful partners . We all have beautiful elements in us ; we 're going to talk about ways that we can expose and maximize them . // The beauty industry is one of the biggest money-takers around ( it sells us a lot ) . We have cosmetics companies and cosmetic surgeons . We have supermodels with their own magazine covers , commercials , and reality shows . We 're obsessed with fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inopportune places . We exercise our bodies , we scrub our faces , we wax off gnarly hair , we buy expensive underwear to push our breasts up and suck our stomachs in . And maybe you 're right . We 're all emphasizing the wrong things . // Here we argue that beauty is also much more than outer appearances alone . As we 'll explore through the middle and the end of the book , beauty is also about how you feel and how you define your life . These three interlocking elements  --  look , feel , be  --  work together to form what we believe is the ultimate goal in all of our lives : to feel good about yourself because you have strong self-esteem and a healthy , energetic existence that allows you to appreciate the subtle beauty of day-to-day life , and because you know your purpose in life  --  and to show off that purpose by helping others do the same . // YOU : Being Beautiful is really about the fact that we 're all hardwired with automatic thoughts and perceptions about beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over thousands of years to form a foundation for human behavior , emphasizing that it 's especially hard to overcome some of the automatic drives . // To that end , beauty is very serious business  --  as in survival-of-the-species serious . When we think about survival of the species ( living long enough to pass your genes on to the next generation ) , it 's natural to emphasize the survival part of the equation . But when it comes down to a choice between surviving and breeding , breeding often wins . ( Think of male grizzlies fighting to the death for a mate . ) Considering the stakes , you 'd better be sure that the object of your affection ( that man with those magnificent abs ) is worthy of the effort to attract him . But how can you know for sure ? Thankfully , just like the metal detector-toting treasure hunter who leaves luck and serendipity to the amateurs , you come fully equipped with your own professional-grade beauty detectors . // When we spot a particularly attractive person , somewhere deep in our reptilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us when we 've struck gold , and it does so automatically and subconsciously . Just like a reflex , it 's automatic , impossible to stop , and Annie Oakley accurate . Your beauty detectors have the mathematical precision of a Swiss watch , and this precision comes in the form of some very specific numbers that you 'll learn about in this book , including something called the Fibonacci sequence . You 'll also learn that 's the reason why we make so many decisions with our emotions and not our logic ; those decisions play a major role in how beautiful and healthy we feel . // To teach you about these things , we 're going to use some of the same techniques you may be familiar with if you 've followed us along this wonderful journey about YOU . We 'll offer YOU Tests to allow you to assess your various states of beauty . We 'll explain ( both verbally and visually ) all of the biology that makes up the systems we talk about ; once you know the why , you 're more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer plenty of YOU Tips and YOU Tools that you can use to look and feel better than you ever have before . Right after this introduction , we 'll test your YOU-Q  --  a measurement of how well you 're doing in your overall pursuit of authenticity and happiness , since there 's quite possibly a large difference between the current you and the potential you ( it 's hard to be happy if that difference is big ) . And we 'll end up with the ultimate beautiful day  --  24 hours of simple changes that can help you get where you can . // Along the way , you 'll be challenged , shocked , and surprised  --  and your perceptions about inner and outer beauty may very well implode right in front of your freshly exfoliated face . You 'll learn why shampoo may not be all that necessary , why and how the perfect smile can be measured down to the millimeter , how a secret to effective foreplay centers around your ten toes , why female orgasms are crucial to the continuation of the species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why a simple change in language fosters or stops addictions , and why our definition of spirituality is like nothing you 've ever heard before . We 'll cover lots of topics in these three parts of beauty  --  including all the health implications and easy-to-follow solutions that can help you get the most out of life . ( In our humble opinions , it does n't get more beautiful than that. ) // As you dive into this book , you 'll come across essential information about the seemingly inconsequential things in life ( hello , pores ! ) , and you 'll come across mind-blowing inspiration about the absolutely consequential things in life ( how to find true meaning and purpose ) . While we 'll hit you with the nuts and bolts of outer beauty , we also hope to inspire you to make changes about how you feel on the inside . Throughout , we 'll try to challenge your assumptions about what true beauty is. // Along the way , you 'll surely look in the mirror  --  both literally and metaphorically . You 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongues , on depression , on knee pain , on energy levels , on sexuality , on prayer , on so many things in your life that you can strengthen to live healthier and happier . It may be hard to imagine that hangnails and deities belong in the same book . But as we hope you come to appreciate , beauty is n't about the parts . It 's about how those parts work together to form the whole . The whole YOU . //
