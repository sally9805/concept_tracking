<p> Colorado 's budget crisis is now entering its third year . While many factors combined to create the mess , Gov . Bill Owens and most state legislators are now convinced that they need to ask voters to make some changes in the 1992 Taxpayer 's Bill of Rights if our state 's finances are ever to return to normal . <p> But with only eight legislative days left before the lawmakers are required to adjourn on May 5 , they still are debating what specifically to change in TABOR - and whether to also modify Amendment 23 , which mandates increased funding for public schools even when state revenues are falling . <p> As far as TABOR goes , reform proposals fall in two categories - those written to release the short-term ratchet effect and those designed to fix the amendment 's long-term ' glide path ' problem that continuously shrinks state spending as a share of the state economy . <p> The ratchet effect is TABOR 's most obvious flaw . The TABOR formula calculates next year 's state revenue limit by adding an allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue limit or the current year 's actual revenue collections - whichever is lower . <p> To keep the numbers simple , imagine the state collected $ 100 last year . With 1 percent population growth and 2 percent inflation , that formula means the state is authorized to collect $ 103 this year . But if a sharp recession cut this year 's actual income to just $ 50 , the TABOR formula would limit Colorado to collecting just $ 51.50 next year - the new , lower base of $ 50 collected this year plus the 1 percent population growth and 2 percent inflation allowances . <p> Obviously , state government revenue did n't fall by half this year . But it did fall sharply in the fiscal year that began July 1 , 2001 . The result was that the next year 's general fund budget had to be cut by $ 236.2 million , or 4.2 percent , from the 2001-02 level . While overall revenues fell slightly again the following year , the state used some one-time revenue gimmicks to increase general fund spending by $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous depressed spending level but below the increase that TABOR would have allowed . <p> Looking at the two fiscal years together , the state is still spending $ 114.6 million less than it did in 2001-02 in nominal dollars , even before adjusting for population growth and inflation . <p> Total state revenue subject to the TABOR limit dropped even more sharply over those two years than budgets did - from $ 8.877 billion in 2000-01 to $ 7.752 billion in 2001-2002 - a $ 1.125 billion drop , or 12.6 percent . Revenue dropped an additional $ 40 million in the next year , to $ 7.712 billion . <p> The key fact to remember as you wade through those numbers is that the current state budget is $ 869 million less than if state spending had been allowed to grow by the amounts permitted by TABOR above their pre-recession , 2001- 02 levels . More important , the TABOR ratchet means cuts can never be restored unless voters specifically authorize additional spending . <p> The simplest way to release that ratchet would be to ask voters to override @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such elections , an action popularly known as a ' de-Brucer ' after TABOR 's author , anti-tax activist Douglas Bruce . <p> The advantage of a de-Brucer is that the General Assembly could refer it to the ballot by a simple majority of the House and Senate . Yet , most lawmakers are reluctant to put a TABOR override alone on the ballot . Republican lawmakers in particular put much of the blame for the state budget crisis on Amendment 23 - which forced the legislators to increase the state 's $ 4.3 billion K-12 education budget by an amount equal to enrollment growth and inflation plus 1 percent despite the falling revenue , forcing them to slash or obliterate other programs . <p> Amendment 23 has no provision for voter overrides and can be changed only by a constitutional amendment . Thus , several package deals have been introduced to suspend or eliminate provisions of Amendment 23 as well as offering temporary or permanent revisions of the TABOR ratchet clause . <p> While the Senate hosts a number of TABOR/23 reform plans , none has yet won the two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Representatives did give final approval to three competing reform proposals but they may also have a hard time winning the two-thirds margin necessary to pass the Senate . <p> Two House plans , HCR 1009 by Rep. Keith King , R-Colorado Springs , and HCR 1001 by Rep. Andrew Romanoff , D-Denver , simply release the short-term TABOR ratchet while making some additional trims in Amendment 23 funding mandates . The third , HCR 1010 by Rep. Brad Young , R-Lamar , is the only one that attempts to deal with the long-term glide path problem in TABOR . Young 's plan includes some reductions in Amendment 23 . But its core provision would replace the current TABOR formula limiting revenue growth to population plus inflation with a new revenue limit of 6 percent of the state economy , as measured by the aggregate personal income of all Colorado taxpayers . <p> Total personal income in the state automatically increases with population and inflation , the factors enshrined in TABOR . But it also rises with economic gains resulting from productivity increases . TABOR excludes such real growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic - shrinking the state budget as a share of the state economy by more than a fourth since TABOR was adopted . In the 1993-94 fiscal year , the first affected by TABOR , state government spending equaled 7.35 percent of aggregate personal income in Colorado . In the current fiscal year , state government spending equals just 5.2 percent of the state economy - a 29 percent reduction in 10 years . <p> Young 's proposal would continue to require voter approval for actual tax increases . But it would permit the revenue from existing taxes to rise to 6 percent of total personal income in the state . Part of that total , 0.25 percent , would be earmarked for a rainy-day fund equal to 10 percent of the general fund - about $ 580 million . When that reserve fund was filled , the revenue limit would drop to 5.75 percent of personal income . <p> In concept , if not detail , Young 's plan is similar to the one being drafted by a coalition of citizens groups that Rutt Bridges describes in an accompanying article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizen proposal would limit state revenue to 6.39 percent of personal income , the level it reached in 2000 , before the current recession hit . <p> Whether Young 's plan or any of the competing de-ratcheting proposals can win legislative approval by May 5 is uncertain . But if the legislature adjourns without addressing the budget crisis , it 's very likely that the citizens coalition led by Bridges ' Bighorn Institute for Public Policy and the Bell Policy Center will launch an initiative drive in behalf of their own TABOR-reform amendment . The coalition also has a second proposal that would postpone Amendment 23 's requirement for a 1 percent increase in education funding during recession years . <p> Thus , whether by legislative action or citizen initiative , it 's likely that Colorado voters will be asked on Nov. 2 whether they want to ease up on the fiscal diet that has already shrunk the state government by 29 percent as a share of the economic activity that government is required to support . <p> To TABOR 's critics , that 's the difference between a successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an endless TABOR-driven anorexia that will eventually kill Colorado 's higher education and other vital programs . @p#
