We were gypsies , Sooni and I. Two sisters in saris surrounded by tuxedoed strangers . But instead of taking our Banjara bullock cart to the nearest water hole , we were in a limo en route to the Oscars , where our first film , Salaam Bombay ! , was nominated as Best Foreign Language Film . It was 1989 , before the government even recognized filmmaking as a legitimate industry . Armed with just good wishes and some telegrams from family and friends , we spent a few days in the luxury of the Beverly Wilshire , not really minding that we were neglected by our own country . When it came time for our award , Jacqueline Bisset and Candice Bergen tripped and stuttered through the foreign names . As Jackie and Candy announced the winner in another miasma of mispronunciation , Sooni leaned across and said , " India is still too far . " <P> <P> It was back then . In 1976 , when I 'd trekked across Radcliffe Yard to the Charles River to meet the person who would become my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a handful of Indian undergraduates at Harvard . As an Indian filmmaker in New York City in the 1980s , I would ride Greyhound with my documentaries , showing my films to anyone who 'd have me . I tolerated audiences who would ask whether there was tap water in India and how come I spoke such good English . Later , raising money for Mississippi Masala , starring Denzel Washington , a studio head asked me to " make room for a white protagonist . " Back home , my films were also alternative . They were the opposite of Bollywood , and I was an outsider . The publicity campaign for Salaam Bombay ! was a horse-drawn carriage stuffed with the street kids from the film , re-enacting scenes through megaphones . <P> My breakthrough was Monsoon Wedding  --  a love song to my Delhi and an ode to masti , the Punjabi intoxication with life . I wanted to capture my India , a place that has always lived in several centuries at once , an India of cell phones and peacocks , where housewives play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent man reinvents himself as an event manager , only to be undone by love . Little did I know then that people from Iceland to Hungary to Southern California would claim the Vermas as their family and our wedding as theirs . <P> Today Bollywood is on as many screens in midtown Manhattan as in an Indian neighborhood in Queens . The literary world has learned to pronounce Vikram and Amitav and Jhumpa , and an Amrita Sher-Gil can fetch as much as a Warhol at auction . A click on the Internet instantly conveys the burgeoning scope of South Asian cultural confidence , yielding details of hundreds of art galleries , concerts , readings , plays and indie films . When I was invited back to Harvard for a South Asian night in 2001 , I was ushered into a hall brimming with 1,500 heads of shiny black hair . " They 'd better be careful , " I joked . " Soon this country will be run by people who look like us . " <P> But why is it that India arrives only when the West says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a century , as every Russian cabdriver in Manhattan will tell you . And if the West is now waking up to our energy and confidence , will we be tempted to change ? Will Oscar fever mean we temper our spice to suit Western palates ? Will the few Indian actors and directors cherry-picked by Hollywood shove the khadi and brocade under the carpet and make chick flicks on Fifth Avenue ?
