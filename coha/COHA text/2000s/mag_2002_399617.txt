Come with me into the workroom of a tumble-down old blacking factory on the River Thames , in England , about the year 1823 . The room is full of little tables , and at each table is a little boy , just about your age . Each table is full of pots of blacking paste for blacking stoves and boots and things . The little boys are covering the pots with oiled paper , tying on caps , and pasting on labels . All day long , in a room almost as dark and ugly as the blacking paste , the children work , without any play or any school to make them happy . If you look very hard in the dim light of a cloudy day you will find a little boy about eleven years old , with a thin white face and big black eyes . He is working very hard and trying to like the employment . But surely it seems that " Friday 's child is full of woe , " as the old jingle goes . He is Charles Dickens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy days , when his father met with misfortune , in order to go to work to make a living . " I was born ( as I have been informed and believe ) on a Friday at twelve o'clock . It was marked when the clock began to strike , I began to cry simultaneously . " This is the way Charles Dickens described his birth in a book called David Copperfield which you will all know and love some day , and which is , for the most part , the story of the author 's life . Up to the time he was eleven , little Charles laughed at the Friday rime . A happy mother and father and a little sister Fanny were very glad indeed , on February 7 , 1812 , when Charles was born . It was the year of America 's second war of independence against England , but John Dickens and his family did n't pay much attention to that , for they had a comfortable home on the Hampshire coast , and Mr. Dickens only knew of the war because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office . For eleven years they were all happy together . Charles loved outdoors and all the things and people around him . He watched the trees and the animals in the barnyard intently , and loved them , and thought out little stories about them . And he watched and talked with the sailors at the docks . He never forgot those old men , with their smells of salt and tar , with their hard hands and red faces and their marvelous tales of foreign lands , and he loved them , so he made them live forever . He would sit on the docks and watch the ships come in and go out and imagine the great tales he afterward so carefully wrote for you and me , and which are among the most treasured in English literature . // Charles was not a strong boy and did not like to play games with his neighbors . But he found the most beautiful play-land imaginable in his father 's books . Don Quixote and Robinson Crusoe and the Vicar of Wakefield helped keep him company and were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school and enjoyed doing his lessons , as all of us do who know the romance of books and figures . But when he was eleven , something perfectly terrible happened . His father had to go to the debtors ' prison ! In those days when a man owed money , he was sent to prison . It was a very dreadful thing , for , you see , he could not then earn the money to pay his debts and be freed . At this time Fanny Dickens was the only fortunate member of the family , for she won a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music , but little Charles had to go to work . He had to go to work and perhaps grow up very ignorant and useless indeed , when he did so wish to go to school . " The blacking factory was a crazy old house , with a wharf of its own , abutting on the water when the tide was in , and on the wind when the tide was out , and literally overrun with rats . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , I dare say ; its decaying floor and staircase ; the squeaking and scuffling of the old gray rats down in the cellars , and the dirt and rottenness of the place ; are things not of many years ago in my mind , but of the present time , " he wrote much later . It is here we find the sensitive little boy , who loved the sod and the growing things and his books so much . For a while he hated it terribly , but after awhile he determined to make the best of it . And that time , you know , is just when things brighten , for they are only as bad as you make them . There are other romances besides those found in books : the stories of the streets . Charles loved to watch the odd people he saw strolling about him and the places in which they lived ; he liked to talk to them and hear their thoughts and their adventures . It was from these folks that he learned the tender lesson of sympathy and understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London streets . And it was from them that he came to know the living truths that made him the loved writer he has come to be . At night when his work at the blacking factory was over , he would slip away so quietly that none would see him . For never in the world would he have anyone guess that his father was at the old Marshalsea prison ! Up a long flight of stairs , into a poorly furnished room with only a very little fireplace , Charles would climb after his long day and his long walk . He would seat himself quietly at the table , very sparsely covered with food ( for in Marshalsea prison in those days , the prisoners did a kind of housekeeping in their quarters ) , and then he would eat hungrily . He made very little money at the blacking factory , just enough for his barest needs , and being much like other boys and girls I know , preferred to spend part of it on pastry even when he might have to go without his dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and father would plan for ways to make enough money to get out of the prison ; but Charles would read by the light of a very dim tallow candle until his head drooped on his shoulder and his eyes grew heavy . And at last his father would say regretfully , " You 'll have to be leaving , my son . " Now was n't that a dreadful thing for a poor father to have to say ! Grimy and poor as the jail was , it was much better than the attic room where Charles lived . He could n't sleep there long and would awaken early to eat his bit of bread and cheese . So he would slip down by a wall beside the Thames , from which point he could look at London Bridge , and a little maid-of-all-work , whom later he described as the Marchioness in his book Old Curiosity Shop , would come and sit with him . And the tales he would spin about the people that passed ! That woman , so cold and handsome , riding betimes in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in BLeak House ) ; and that old sailor had just come from India , with a cargo of silks and precious gems ! " Oh , there 's only one thing I 'd rather do than read books , and that 's write them , " Charles would sigh . " Shucks , you better run " long " n " make your rent tomorrow , " the little maid-of-all-work would say regretfully , as she realized their play-hour was up . But the portion of hard times meted out to Friday 's child came to an end as all hard times do , if you only work hard enough . After awhile Charles ' father came into a little money , with which he paid his debts . Then he was released from prison and sent his son to school . Of course , the little boy loved that , and was particularly happy after the hard times he had suffered . He invented new games and new languages by adding syllatiles to words ; and wrote stories , which he traded for marbles and white mice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright scenery . He even wrote plays for the boys to give . It was wonderful to Charles , after the blacking factory . Mr. Dickens decided that his son should be making a start in some respectable business . If you read David Copperfield and recognize Mr. Dickens in the character of Mr. Macawber , you will see how very , very respectable he was . So he obtained for the boy the position of clerk in a law office . Here Charles was the delight of the other clerks , for he could mimic everyone he saw // in the street . For this reason , he thought , inasmuch as he found the study of law dry , he would like to be an actor . Because of a sore throat on the day he was to meet the great actor Charles Kemble , however , he never realized this ambition but began to work as a court reporter . Here was adventure ! No more digging facts out of big books , but the catching of speeches in shorthand and the sight of new people and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent away to report speeches , sometimes writing out his notes in a galloping coach by the light of a lantern . Soon he began to be sent to write reviews of plays . He signed his writings " Boz , " and they became very popular . When his first stories-the Pickwick Papers , written to fit pictures already made-were printed , and when Sam Weller took the public 's heart by storm , Charles ' feet were well turned down the highway of success . Charles Dickens was never a man who was interested in the results of his work . He was interested in his work for its own sake , and that , you know , is the only way to do great things . He gained a keen insight into people in the difficult days of the blacking factory , and he understood their troubles and their sorrowful little lives , and he loved them . Nothing but the revealing of hypocrisy , the plea for the sordidness of the poor , the condition of the unfortunate , and a tender love for all creatures can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Little Nell and Nicholas Nickleby and his friend Mark Tapley , and poor little Oliver Twist and all the people of London who come to live forever and ever in Charles ' wonderful books , to make folks laugh and cry and laugh again . <p>
