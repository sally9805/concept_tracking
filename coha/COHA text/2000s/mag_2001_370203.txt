Kate Mulgrew stars in Star Trek : Voyager ; the finale airs May 23 at 8 p.m . <P> Q. I promise this will be painless . <P> A. I like it painful . Then I know I 'm fully alive . Let 's engage here . <P> Q. Why did n't you and Chakotay ever get it on ? I have no idea what that means . <P> A. To get it on ? <P> Q. No , Chakotay . <P> A. Chakotay is my first officer , right ? <P> Q. Sure . <P> A. I had a hell of a task in front of me , to demystify a female in command for all those teenage boys who are Star Trek fans . Dropping trou , getting into all that trouble  --  red alert . <P> Q. Jeri Ryan plays this half borg , but the only inhuman thing I can see about her is this little design on her cheek , unless borgs have giant breasts . <P> A. She 's amply endowed , but I do n't think that 's typical of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rated show on UPN , but is n't that like being the second best student at Gonzaga ? <P> A. How dare you . That 's my former husband 's school . <P> Q. You played Mrs. Columbo . How much time did you have to spend visualizing having sex with Peter Falk ? <P> A. As an actress it was my obligation to do so on a daily basis . As a human being I summarily avoided it . <P> Q. At home before sex , do you ever yell " Engage ! " at your husband ? <P> A. No , I talk about tachyon emissions . <P> Q. What 's that ? <P> A. Tachyon emissions are the most powerful subspace emissions . So I just pretend my husband is the ship . And we go to impulse . <P> Q. How do you spell this tachyon thing ? <P> A. This is a hopeless interview because you 've never watched even two seconds of Voyager . T-a-c-h-y-o-n . And I 'm sure you know how to spell emissions . <P>  --  By Joel Stein    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
