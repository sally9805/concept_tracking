Chelsea was being followed . It was crazy . True , this was n't the best neighborhood in Boston , but it was seven o'clock in the morning . It was broad daylight . She glanced behind her . There were three of them-lean , dangerous-looking young men dressed in gang colors . She slipped the strap of her purse securely around her neck as she moved more quickly down the sidewalk . She could be wrong . Maybe they were heading toward the H &R; Block that was three doors down from her office . Maybe they were looking to have their taxes done . They were right behind her now , and she moved aside , toward the street , praying that they would walk on past . They did n't . " Hey , blondie . " The taller of the three leered at her-if it was possible for a sixteen-year-old to leer . They were only kids . Kids with fuzz on their upper lips and chins that was supposed to pass as facial hair . Kids pretending to be grown men . Kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who probably carried knives and could hurt her badly before she could even shout for help . " You part of the beautification program in this part of the city ? " the shortest of the three asked , laughing at his own joke . He wore an enormous ring in his nose-obviously to make up for his lack of height . He could n't have been more than fourteen yearsold . The third boy made animal noises-part dog , part barnyard pig-as he invaded her personal space . Chelsea stepped out between two parked cars , into the street . " Excuse me . I need to get to work , and you should probably get to school- " She had to stop short to keep from bumping into the tall one . " Excuse me , " he mimicked her . " Excuse me . We do n't go to no friggin ' school . " " Maybe you should reconsider . You could use a little help with your grammar . " She stepped around him , but the dog-boy blocked her path . He grinned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp little points . He snorted and woofed at her obvious alarm . That 's all they wanted . They wanted to scare her . Well , okay . She was scared . They could let her go now . " You got some money we can borrow ? " the nose-ring wearer asked . " We 'll pay you back-we promise . " She felt a flash of anger , wondering how often that had worked-how often the people they intimidated simply handed over their money . As the other boys laughed Chelsea pushed past them onto the sidewalk , aware of the cars moving down the street , aware that not a single one of them had even slowed to see if she needed help . " Go away , " she said sharply , " before I call your mothers . " It was the wrong thing to say . The dog-boy pushed her , hard , and she went down onto her knees . The tall one grabbed the strap of her purse and it lifted her back up as it caught around her throat . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was dragged and bounced along the cracked , uneven sidewalk . She heard herself screaming and she felt her shoe come off , felt her toes scrape along the concrete . Her head snapped back and her arm twisted behind her as the boy yanked her bag free . God ! All the work she did at home last night-those disks were in her purse ! Chelsea pushed herself up off the sidewalk , kicked off her other shoe , and ran after them . They were nearly a block ahead of her , but she could think of nothing but all those hours of work , and she ran faster . And then it happened . With a squeal of tires , a white delivery truck bounced over the curb , right onto the sidewalk in front of the three kids . The driver swung himself out the open door of the cab , landing directly on top of the tallest boy . The kid was no match for a full-grown man , and the truck driver was extremely full grown . All it took was an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her shoulderbag pulled free from his hands . But the dog-boy and the kid with the nose-ring were both behind the man . Chelsea saw a glint of sunlight reflect off the blade of a knife . " Look out ! " she shouted , and the man turned . The way he moved was graceful , like a choreographed dance , as he disarmed the kid with a well-placed sweep of his foot . He moved threateningly toward the dog-boy , who turned tail and ran after his friends . Chelsea slowed to a stop , aware that her heart was pounding , that her panty hose were torn , her clothes askew , her hair loosened from her usual French braid and dangling around her shoulders , aware that the soles of her feet burned and stung from her shoeless run down the rough city sidewalk . She had to bend over to catch her breath , hands braced above her bruised knees . She tilted her head to look up at the man who 'd rescued her handbag . He looked even taller from this position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue jeans and worn white leather athletic shoes . He wore a Boston Red Sox cap backward over a dark head of unruly curls and a T-shirt that proclaimed in large red letters i 'm too sexy for my shirt . Given a leather jacket and a studded dog collar , he could have been those kids ' older and far more dangerous brother . " You all right ? " he asked her , moving closer , his dark eyes even darker with concern . " You need me to call the paramedics ? " Chelsea shook her head no , taking quick stock of her bruises and scrapes . Both knees were bleeding slightly , as were both elbows and the heel of one hand . The top of her right foot and most of those toes were sore . Her neck felt raw where the strap of her purse had given her a burn . " I 'm okay . " She straightened up , trying to tuck her blouse back into her skirt , trying to ignore the fact that her hands were shaking so hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't ignore it . " Maybe you should sit down . " Chelsea nodded . Sit down . That would be good . She let him lead her across the sidewalk to a building that had a stone stairway going up to the front entrance . He helped her sit on the third step up , then sat next to her , setting her handbag between them and pulling off his baseball cap . She glanced at him , aware that he was gazing at her . He was n't what she 'd call classically handsome . His nose was big and crooked , as if it had been broken one too many times . His cheekbones were rugged and angular , showcasing a pair of liquid-brown , heavily lidded eyes . His mouth was generously wide , with full , sensuous lips that seemed on the verge of a smile . His hair was dark and curly and long , and as he steadily returned her curious gaze he pulled it back into a ponytail at the nape of his neck . " I 've seen you around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . His voice was deep and husky , with more than a hint of urban Boston coloring it . " You opened up that computer consulting business around the corner , right ? " She nodded . She had n't seen him around . She would 've remembered . " I 'm Chelsea Spencer . " She held out her hand . " I know , " he said , finally letting his smile loose as he gently clasped her fingers . It was a smile that was set on heavy stun . Chelsea was not normally affected by such things , but this man 's smile was off the scale . It was a smile that seemed to echo the words on his T-shirt . She glanced at those words again . He followed her gaze and actually blushed , a delicate shade of pink tingeing his rugged cheekbones . " A friend got me this shirt , " he explained sheepishly . " I 'm visiting him today , and I wore it , you know , kind of like a joke ? " He was still holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends call me Johnny . " " Thank you for saving my bag . " His smile faded as his gaze swept her scraped knees and dirt-streaked clothes . " I wish I got there sooner . They did n't do more than knock you over , did they ? " He was watching her closely . His eyes may have been lazily hooded , but Chelsea got the sense that this man missed nothing . She shook her head . " No . " He ran one hand down his face . " Jeez , will you listen to me ? ' They did n't do more than knock you over ' - as if that was n't enough . I saw you bounce when you hit the ground . You sure you do n't want some professional help getting cleaned up ? There 's a hospital not too far from here and it wo n't take too long . " " Oh , no ! " Chelsea pulled her hand free and closed her eyes . " Oh , God , I 've got a meeting with a client in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly hysterical , so she stopped . " I look like I 've been hit by a train . " " You look like you 've been mugged . " Chelsea stood , searching the street for a taxi . " If I hurry , I can take a cab home and get cleaned up and only be a few minutes late . " She turned to face him . " Thank you again . If you had n't come to my rescue . . . " Johnny stood up , too , and again she was startled by how very tall he was . " Lookit , I 'm running a little early . Hop in the truck , and I 'll give you a ride home and back . " She gazed at him in surprise . He laughed , as if he could read the trepidation in her eyes . " I 'm not dangerous , " he told her . " I promise . Come on , I work for Meals on Wheels , delivering food to helpless little old ladies who unlock their apartment doors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a key ring the size of New Hampshire for all the people who ca n't get up to answer their own door . " Meals on Wheels . The words were painted on the side of the truck that was still parked in the middle of the sidewalk . Meals on Wheels was a charity organization that delivered precooked meals to shut-ins . Some of them were ill , some elderly , all of them unable either to get to a grocery store or cook their own meals for whatever reason . Whoever this Giovanni Anziano was , the Meals on Wheels organization trusted him enough to allow him to make deliveries . He smiled again , and Chelsea felt her stomach flip-flop . She could imagine him smiling at her that way as he leaned over to kiss her , as he pulled her against that rock-solid body , encircling her with those powerful arms . She could imagine him smiling at her as he helped her out of her clothes and . . . Where on earth had that thought come from ? She was n't prone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . No matter if they were , indeed , too sexy for their shirts . " Hop in , " Johnny said again . " I 'll go get your shoes . " Chelsea Spencer . She was sitting in the Meals on Wheels truck . She was sitting next to him , holding tightly to her bag as he took the right turn onto Beacon Street , heading out toward Brookline , where she lived . Johnny glanced at her again , smiling as he met her eyes . Man , she was the definition of incredible . It was weird , because she was n't especially pretty-at least not in the conventional sense . Her nose was a touch too pointy , her chin too sharp . But taken with the rest of her face , she was strikingly attractive . Her eyes were a shade of blue Johnny had n't even known existed before he first caught sight of her . Her hair was silky and golden blonde . And her mouth . . . Her lips were gracefully shaped and gorgeously full . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been doing a hell of a lot of fantasizing lately . . . . " I 'd been meaning to stop in your office and introduce myself for a couple of weeks now , " he said , pulling up to a red light and turning to look at her . She glanced at him again , and he could see an answering flash of attraction in her eyes . He felt his pulse accelerate and forced himself to slow down . He had a shot here . If he asked her out , there was actually a chance that she would accept . But he had to chill out , take it slow , be cool . Be very , very cool . The light turned green , and he stepped on the gas . He could n't believe it when he 'd seen the three punks knocking Chelsea down to the ground . And he really could n't believe it when she started chasing after them . The lady had guts . When most people were mugged , they got up and ran in the opposite direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . She snorted . " Of course . " Johnny nodded . " Of course . " He tried to hide his smile . " Silly question . " " Will you do me a favor ? " Oh yeah . Especially if it involved full body contact . . . He nodded again , aware that she was watching him . He forced himself to sound cool . Nonchalant . " Sure . " She smiled . " Do n't you want to know what it is first ? " " Nope . " " Hmmm . In that case , maybe I better think about whether there are any other big favors I need done . . . " She was flirting . Chelsea Spencer was flirting with him . " How about we discuss the terms of this favor over dinner tonight ? " he countered . There . Damn ! He did it . He asked her out . But she just laughed . " There 're no terms . I just need you to file a statement with the police . You probably got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All right , but . . . " He shook his head . " Just do n't expect the police to be able to do too much with what we tell them . " Her smile faded . " I know there 's only a small chance the police will be able to find those boys , but . . . " She suddenly sat forward in her seat , pointing . " Take the next left . My building 's the second on the right . " He followed her instructions and double-parked in front of her building . This block was all high-priced condominiums . The buildings were perfectly maintained , their grounds well kept . It was Nice , with a capital N , and a silent but very present dollar sign in front of that capital N. Chelsea Spencer had money . A lot more money than he 'd imagined . Johnny gazed up at the ritzy building . It was possible this lady was out of his league . Not that he necessarily thought so , but if she thought so , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to look back at him . " I 'll be quick . " " Do n't be so quick that you forget to wash out those scrapes with soap . " She smiled . " You sound like my mother . " " No , I sound like my mother . She was a doctor . " " No kidding . " " Nope . " She was just sitting there , one hand on the opened door , gazing across the truck into his eyes . Johnny gazed back , hardly daring to breathe . " I 'll , um , go change , " she said breathlessly . " I 'll be right here . "
