Section : THE Pastel PAGE <p> Pastel is the ideal medium for exploring a full range of artistic possibilities . I enjoy painting an array of subjects , from realistic still lifes to abstract landscapes . My work in acrylics , before I discovered pastels , was tight and highly detailed , but now , applying dry pigment , with no medium or brash , allows me to work more freely . In addition , since my children are demanding of my time , I paint at odd hours and often have to leave a painting in progress . Pastels require little cleanup , no chemical solvents , and there 's no drying time . <p> Besides these benefits of the medium , I enjoy pastels because they help me achieve a high level of realism yet maintain a painterly appearance in the final work . One of the most important aspects of my approach is to achieve balance and cohesion . To do this , I rely on careful composition and effective lighting on both the subject and my work surface . <p> To begin a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in terms of unusual shape and design . For a still life , I arrange the objects in natural light near a window , emphasizing an appealing abstract quality , such as long shadows or an interesting texture . I never use artificial light ; sunlight is more convenient , and I like its softness . As I assemble the objects , I look for a balance of color and form . <p> Once I 'm satisfied with the setup and lighting , I take photographs from different angles . Later , I study the pictures carefully by laying them on a table . I then select a few for specific details , such as highlights or shadow shapes and colors . I take note of value and color changes , and I never use just one photo for reference . With a small notepad kept near at hand , I study the photos to jot down certain details or ideas that I want to remember , then refer to those notes throughout the painting process . <p> To finalize my composition , I make small studies in graphite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me develop it further . Next , I make a quick study with a few pastels . When I have selected my palette , I put away the rest of the pastels . A limited palette helps narrow my choices and prevents my overworking the piece . <p> My surface of choice is Canson Mi-Teintes paper . Generally , I favor a medium-gray tone such as felt gray . To begin painting , I project the image from my compositional sketch onto the paper , although I never rely on the projector because it can create distortions . As I transfer the composition I make corrections . This step of redrawing may take a few days to complete , depending on the details involved in the piece . Then I begin to fill in the shadows very lightly with a No. 2 graphite pencil , a step that establishes the values before I apply any color . I am careful not to push too hard with my pencil , as this will leave a permanent dent in the paper . <p> Since I often paint at night when my children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from both the left and right sides on my work surface . An additional benefit of two light sources is that they eliminate any shadows that my hand creates on the paper . Once the lighting is set up , I put down several layers of newspaper on my drawing table to make a cushion for my pastel paper and ensure my strokes will be soft . <p> Working on a flat table , I generally begin each painting from the top , but I sometimes start with the focal point and progress outward . After these initial sections are complete , I move everything to my easel , taping the drawing and newspaper to my drawing board and positioning it vertically . I always work from the top down , completing each section as I travel down the paper . This approach prevents the pastel dust from falling on any completed areas . <p> First , I establish the underpainting with Nupastel sticks . Painting loosely , I exaggerate the forms and block in color masses . Next , I blend and rub with my fingers until all areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I squint my eyes so I can see the lights and darks as masses , ignoring any detail or color inside the masses . At this point , I occasionally turn down the lights to check and recheck that my darks remain dark and that my values are correct . <p> I blend the pastels with my fingers , using a different finger for each colon To keep the colors clear and bright , I wash my hands when switching from dark to light hues . Also , I keep pull-up baby wipes near my easel for quick cleanup . I spend about half my time during this stage standing back from the painting and studying it . Viewing my picture from a distance helps me see any errors I may have made in value changes or colors . Using a mahlstick enables me to work on a certain section of the painting without laying a hand on the paper , which is critical , because doing so can cause the paper to buckle from skin heat and oil . Sometimes I use a piece of tracing paper as a temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is complete , I switch to Rembrandt pastels for the next layers , finishing with a softer pastel , such as Sennelier . When changing colors , I find it helpful to make small marks on the outside of the painting with the pastel . This reminds me of the color and value I will be applying before I actually put it on the painting , and it helps eliminate errors . <p> Since I apply my pastels in many layers , the tooth of the paper fills quickly . I spray fixative if I need to regain some tooth , but I never use it at the end because fixative darkens and dulls the pastel , especially the highlights . Instead of blending the lightest highlights , I " chunk " them together thickly on the paper . I want them to jump out at the viewer and add sparkle and depth , as in Sunlight on Statue , Beef Behind Bars , or Homegrown Tomatoes . <p> As a piece nears completion , I review the painting as a whole and touch up any area that may have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also soften edges that are too harsh , not wanting to lose the effects of natural lighting . <p> A painting is finished when I feel that it shows balance , good lighting , mood , depth , and a striking composition . Once satisfied that I 've accomplished all of that , I hold up a precut mat to my work to see how it should be cropped . Sometimes I decide to frame only a small portion of the painting instead of the original composition . Before framing a piece , I hold the paper up and tap the back of it with my fingers to knock off any loose dust . This step prevents pieces of pastel from falling off onto the clean mat . I usually frame the piece using a double mat , which prevents the pastel from touching the glass . <p> As a self-taught artist , I believe it 's important to paint as often as I can . The support of my family and friends motivates me , as does the pleasure I derive from painting . It gives me a wonderful feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not match in any other way . DEMONSTRATION : BEAUTY OF A BULB <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 1 . I took many photographs of this setup from different angles and studied them carefully . After selecting a few to use as reference , I drew the image on Canson Mi-Teintes paper with s graphite pencil . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 2 . Working from top to bottom , I began laying in each area with Nupastel colors . I loosely applied the pastel , rubbing and blending with my fingers , completing one section before moving on to the next . The small marks on the margins reminded me of the colors and values I had applied . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 3 . I gradually began to build the form as I increased the number of layers , using soft pastels such as Rembrandt and Sennelier . After I completed the bulb and flower , I deepened the background color , which created a greater sense of space and depth . By developing the background first , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was careful not to disturb any completed sections . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 4 . I roughly laid in the underpainting of the vase . At this point , I stood back and studied the painting , making sure my colors and values were correct and balanced one another . I wanted my darks and lights to stay clear and bright . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 5 . I completed the layers of the vase using Rembrandt and Sennelier pastels . I also touched up the areas that had lost some of their glow from falling pastel dust . I reviewed the piece as a whole and brightened up the highlights and softened some of the edges , creating a balanced piece . The completed painting : Beauty of a Bulb , 1998 , pastel , 20 x 10 .
