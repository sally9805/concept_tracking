Clever , You My Jesuit training from long ago leads to love your magazine , although at times do consider it , in matters financial , an addendum to Das Kapital . Imagine my surprise , nay , my amazement , then , to agree with your views on the current financial crisis ( " Encourage Savings " and " Gekko and Aquinas , " Current Comment , 1 1/3 ) . A small , dark recess of my mind , however , is hollering , " Watch out ! They 're just softening you up ! " Fernando Palomeque , M.D. Houma , La . Toxic Waste Your commentary on " Bishops and the Conference " ( Current Comment , 1 1/10 ) gently made its point about the teaching authority of bishops ' conferences , but it missed the larger point at issue : Does the U.S.C.C.B. pastoral letter Forming Consdences fir Faithful Citizenship ly follow the Catholic tradition on conscience formation , on the virtue of prudence , on cooperation in evil and on the range of moral issues to which a wellformed Catholic conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bishops ' position on these issues is faithfully Catholic . That is ultimately why their teaching is relevant in the Diocese of Scranton . But that raises a further question . Is Bishop Joseph F. Martino 's rejection of the document also implicitly a rejection the Catholic moral tradition on these issues ? In pre-Vatican ? theology , this would be called prxima haeresi , " bordering on heresy . " If that is the case , then Bishop Martino 's teaching on these issues is irrelevant , if not toxic , in his own diocese . John Topel , SJ . Pon Townsend , Wash . Hands off Revelation In her article on St. Paul 's teachings on women 's roles in church and society ( " Paul and Women , " 1 1/10 ) , Barbara E. Reid , O.P. , suggests some sections of Paul 's letters may be later additions . But when we do not understand a passage in the New Testament ( or when we do not like it ) , an easy - and most unwise - way to deal with it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who would deny Peter 's authority by alleging that Jesus ' conferrai of authority upon him in Matthew 's Gospel is a later addition ? What makes us think that we can better determine what was an authentic writing than what the early councils determined to be truly inspired ? I admit I do not understand several of Paul 's writings , but I would not dare to deny their divine inspiration . That would be manipulating God 's revelation to fit my own opinions . Eduardo Garza Katy , Tex . A Fond Farewell It was with regret that I read the farewell by Daniel J. Harrington , SJ. , in his final Word column ( " The Last Judgment , " 1 1/17 ) . His scholarship was appreciated by those of us not so gifted as he , yet still responsible for preaching . ( Rev. ) Dan Arnold Erie , Pa . Thanks for the Help Thanks to Daniel J. Harrington , S.J. ( " The Last Judgment , " 11/17 ) , for his three years of dedication in sharing with us his insights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always the first bit of the magazine I read every week , and I have always found his writings and insights most helpful in sharing my insights about the readings with the people of God in my homilies . I now look forward to his successor , Barbara E. Reid , O.P. , another insightful Scripture scholar who will be sharing her theological expertise with us . ( Rev. ) Joe Annese Henderson , Nev . Military Clout Tom Cornell suggests in " The Chaplain 's Dilemma " ( 11/17 ) that the military chaplaincy should be disestablished so that chaplains do not " serve two masters . " But chaplains must be commissioned officers in the military if they are to have the clout needed to do their jobs . Consider the account in the same issue by John J. McLain , SJ . ( " Showing God 's Face on the Battlefield , " 11/17 ) , of his experience accompanying a seriously wounded soldier to a hospital by helicopter . What chance would he have had to get on that helicopter if he had been a civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer and a priest to his enlisted congregation . S. J. Skahill Shelton , Wash . The Editorial Wall I found that the articles on military chaplaincy ( 1 1/17 ) outlined the positions around this issue in a thoughtful manner and fairly represented each side of the question . What seemed to be left out , however , was the role of America in carrying advertisements sponsored by the United States government to attract chaplain candidates . It is without dispute that the men and women in our military should have religious and spiritual support available to them . However , does the prominence and content of these advertisements cross the line of maintaining editorial independence regarding these " wars of choice " being waged by our country ? Tom Cornell proposes that military chaplaincy be disestablished so that chaplains are not forced to serve two masters . But when your publication carries advertisements recruiting chaplains for the military in such a prominent manner , does the magazine not fall into the same category ? Can you take advertising revenues from the military establishment on the one hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other ? To continue this policy brings your editorial credibility into question . Frank McCaffrey Weston , Vt . Last Rites Re " Showing God 's Face on the Battlefield , " by John J. McLain , SJ. ( 11/1 7 ) : There once was a priest ministering to wounded and dying soldiers on the battlefield during World War I. He came to a dying soldier to offer help . The man said , " But Father , I do n't belong to your religion . " The priest answered , " No , but you belong to my God . " It does n't get any better than that ! Justin Nolan , O.S.B. Latrobe , Pa . A Generous Gift Lyn Brignoli 's winning submission to your essay contest ( " Dragen , Here Is Your Letter , " 10/27 ) gives new meaning to faith in a most profound way . We all benefit from her obvious humility and spiritual generosity . The essay also reveals in her thoughts and deeds the profound nature of conversion . It merits repeated readings by pastors and other spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing and publishing this inspirational essay . Brignoli has deeply affected my own priorities . William Huth Fairfielo , Bolt 's " A Man for All Seasons " ( " Today 's Man , " 1 1/17 ) glossed over one salient line delivered by Cardinal Wolsey in a scene with Thomas More : " There is much in the church that needs reformation , Thomas . " That idea is as pertinent today as it was in Tudor England . Has nothing changed in 500 years ? John Faust St. Louis , Mo . Divine Milieu I feel that William Reiser , SJ. , misses the point of Ancestral Grace , by Diarmuid O'Murchu , M.S.C. , in his review ( " ' And the Word Became Primate ' ? " 11/10 ) . Or better yet , he unwittingly seems to drive it home . While Reiser does pose some challenging questions , he summarily reduces this exploration of the evolving Catholic consciousness to silliness by asking whether the evangelist John would say , " And the Word became primate " or " And the Word became cyborg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's crises in both the world and in religion is in itself an example of the patriarchy that suppresses and suffocates those who dare to think beyond the 2,000-year history of Christianity and find there a different reading of our human story . While Reiser might not find this book " worth the effort " to explore in his course on systematic theology , it is certainly worth a read for those with an evolving Catholic consciousness , for whom Catholic teaching on incarnation , creation , redemption and the Eucharist has become too narrow and suffocating in a world in crisis . I think that another Jesuit , Pierre Teilhard de Chardin , S.J. , would feel somewhat vindicated by the way that O'Murchu has advanced his thought in order to bring hope to a fragmented world and to bring new meaning to what it is to be human . Alice MacDonald Santa Barbara , Calif . Quality Control It was a gift to read about the research on Catholic higher education being done by Melanie Morey and John J. Piderit , SJ . ( " Identity Crisis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Catholic colleges and universities is quite revealing . Truth be told , the same criteria can be applied to high schools , even elementary schools . Why have we not ensured that lay teachers in all our educational institutions receive the advantages in faith education that religious teachers were given in the past ? How do we deal with the numbers of Catholic students and teachers , uneducated in the faith , who enter our high schools , colleges and universities ? Where is the quality control ? Plaudits to Morey and Piderit for bringing into public view a situation that desperately needs attention . Mary Ann Foy , R.C.SJ . Redwood City , Calif .
