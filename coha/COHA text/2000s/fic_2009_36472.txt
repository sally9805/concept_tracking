I snapped awake at 2:18 a.m. , the bloodshot numerals staring at me from the nightstand . For years on end , I woke up at this exact time every night , regardless of what time zone I was in . But after seventeen years I had just started sleeping through the night . I had finally outrun the old fears . Or so I had convinced myself . <p> <p> Remote sirens warbled in the night . At first I figured they were in my head , the sound track to the dream . But the distant wail got louder instead of fading . I had n't awakened on my own . <p> <p> I ran through what I remembered from the previous evening  --  the presidential debate had closed out prime time , and after the commentariat finished yammering , I 'd fallen asleep watching a high- speed chase on the news . A guy in a beat- to- shit Jeep Cherokee , hauling ass down the 405 , a legion of black- and- whites drawn behind him like a parachute . <p> <p> I blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pledge scent of my third- floor condo . My sweat imprint on the sheets and pillow . Breeze rattling palm fronds against my balcony in the next room . <p> <p> And a watery blue light undulating across the bedroom ceiling . <p> <p> I sat up . <p> <p> The TV , across the room on the steamer trunk , was off . But the distant sirens continued . <p> <p> And then , along with the light on the ceiling , the sirens abruptly stopped . <p> <p> I threw off the sheets and padded across the carpet , stepping over a discarded Sports Illustrated and sloughed- off dress shirts from the job I 'd left a week ago . In my plaid pajama bottoms , I ventured into the all- purpose living room , heading for the balcony . The police lights had flickered through the locked sliding glass door . Halfway to it I froze . <p> <p> A thick black nylon rope was dangling from the lip of the roof , its end coiled on my balcony . Motionless . <p> <p> No longer groggy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the balcony , rolling the screen shut behind me . My balcony with its Brady Bunch  --  orange tiles overlooked a narrow Santa Monica street populated by other generic apartment buildings . Streetlights were sporadic . I confronted the rope for a quiet moment , then looked around , expecting who knows what . <p> <p> Bulky shadows of cars lined the gutters . An SUV was double-parked , blocking the street . No headlights , no dome light . Tinted windows . But a huff of smoke from the exhaust pipe . A sedan , dark and silent , wheeled around the turn and halted , idling behind the SUV . <p> <p> Terror reached through seventeen years and set my nerves tingling . <p> <p> I squinted to see if I could make out a police light bar mounted on either roof . In my peripheral vision , the tail of the rope twitched . The roof creaked . Before I had a chance to think , a spotlight blazed up from the SUV , blinding me . A zippering sound came from above , so piercing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , two boots striking me in the chest . I left my feet , flying back through the screen , which ripped free almost soundlessly . I landed on my shoulder blades , hard , the wind knocked out of me . The black-clad figure , outfitted with a SWAT- like jumpsuit and an assault rifle , filled the screen frame with its bits of torn mesh . Even through the balaclava , the guy looked somehow sheepish  --  he had n't seen me beneath the overhang before he 'd jumped . <p> <p> " Shit , " he said . " Sorry . " <p> <p> He 'd made an expert landing , despite the collision , and was aiming the rifle at my face . <p> <p> I guppied silently , a knot of cramped muscles still holding my lungs captive , and rolled to my side . He stepped astride me as I curled around the hot pain in my chest . <p> <p> A hammering of boots in the hall matched my heartbeat , so forceful it jarred my vision , and then the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dead bolt as if a hurricane had hit the other side . It skipped on end , landed flat on the carpet with a whump , and slid to within an inch of my nose . <p> <p> As I writhed between the assailant 's boots , fear gave way to panic . Three men flipped me and proned me out , my face mashing carpet , my front tooth driving into my bottom lip . Gloved hands ran up my sides , checking my ankles , my crotch . More black- clad forms hurtled through the doorway , aiming assault rifles in all directions , a few men streaking off to the bedroom . I heard my folding closet doors slam back on their tracks , the shower curtain raked aside . <p> <p> " Nick Horrigan ? Are you Nick Horrigan ? ! " <p> <p> My chest released , and I finally drew in a screeching breath . And another . I rolled onto my back , stared up at the one face not covered by a hood and goggles . Lean , serious features , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved back from a side part . The salt- and- pepper stubble darkening the jaw matched neither the neat knot of the standard- issue red tie nor the high and tight haircut . <p> <p> " Are you Nick Horrigan ? " <p> <p> I nodded , still fighting to draw in a proper breath . A warm , salty trickle ran from my split lip down my chin . The other men  --  fifteen of them ?  --  had spread through the condo , dumping drawers , knifing open the couch cushions , overturning chairs . I heard flatware tumble onto the linoleum . My clock radio blared on  --  a jingle for antifungal ointment  --  and then I heard someone curse , and it abruptly cut off . <p> <p> The gray- haired man frowned at me , then surveyed the others , radiating authority . " The hell 's the matter with him , Sever ? " <p> <p> " I hit him in the chest when I rappelled from the roof . " A faint southern accent  --  Maryland or Virginia , maybe . The guy tugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a military- looking flattop . He was much wider than the boss man crouching over me . Younger , too  --  probably in his mid- forties , though his creased tan aged him up a bit . His bearing suggested he was the alpha dog among the jumpsuits . <p> <p> The boss returned his gaze to me . " Nick Horrigan , born 6/12/73 ? Son of Agent Frank Durant ? " <p> <p> " Stepson , " I managed . <p> <p> He shoved a photograph in my face . A man shown from the chest up , wearing a blue blazer and the scowl of the unphotogenic . A wide mouth and slack lips lent him a slightly wild quality . His blond hair was slicked back , the camera catching furrows left by the comb . <p> <p> " What 's the last contact you had with this man ? " <p> <p> " I do n't know this guy , " I said . <p> <p> " Then you 've been in phone or e-mail contact with him . " <p> <p> I caught a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty Cup o ' Noodles I 'd left on the kitchen counter . The photo moved abruptly in front of my nose again . " I told you , " I said . " I do n't know who the hell he is . " <p> <p> The boss grabbed my arms and tugged me to a sitting position . Over his shoulder I could see my framed Warner Bros. still , sitting shattered at the base of the wall . Yosemite Sam was looking back at me with an expression of matching bewilderment . Glancing down , I stared numbly at the bootsize red marks on my bare chest . " Who are you ? " the man asked , pulling my focus back to him . <p> <p> My voice still sounded tight . " You already know . I 'm Nick Horrigan . " <p> <p> " No , I mean what do you do ? " <p> <p> " I just left a job at a charity group , " I said . <p> <p> One of the guys behind me guffawed . <p> <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now- empty nightstand drawer by the handle . " I got nothing . " <p> <p> The boss swiveled to face a guy wanding the kitchen with a magnetometer . The guy shook his head . " Sorry , Mr. Wydell . " <p> <p> " Okay . " Wydell ran a hand through his gray hair . It fell back precisely into the side part . His exacting demeanor fit his professional bearing  --  the sole suit among rugged operators . " Okay . Get him a shirt . " <p> <p> A T-shirt flew from the vicinity of my bedroom , hitting me in the head . <p> <p> " Put this on . Let 's go . " <p> <p> My Pac- Man shirt . Great . I tugged it on , and two guys hoisted me to my feet . Figuring I 'd want ID wherever I was going , I grabbed my money clip from the kitchen counter and stuffed it into the floppy pocket of my drawstring pajama pants . <p> <p> " Let 's go , let 's go , " Wydell said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stopped moving , and the two men commanding me to the door stumbled into me . " Can you please show me a badge ? " I said , though I pretty much figured . <p> <p> Wydell 's lips pinched . His hand darted behind his lapel , withdrew his commission book with its recessed badge . Hunched eagle and flag , rendered in gold . u.s. secret ser vice . His commission was behind plastic inside the leather book . joseph wydell , special agent in charge . He was from the Los Angeles Regional Office , which meant he was n't on the protection detail of a par tic u lar politician but oversaw general intelligence in Southern California . Why was the head of the Secret Ser vice L.A. office on site at a raid instead of waiting back in his air- conditioned office ? <p> <p> " What do you think I did ? " I asked . <p> <p> Someone handed him my sneakers , and he thumped them against my chest . I took them . He hustled me out into the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one at each side . They held the diamond formation as we barreled toward the stairs . <p> <p> Mrs. Plotkin stood in her doorway in a white spa bathrobe , her copper hair heaped high , showing off white roots . She looked worried  --  one of her favorite expressions . <p> <p> " Get back in your apartment , ma'am , " Sever said , the accent more pronounced now . <p> <p> We were approaching fast , but she held her ground . " Where are you taking him ? " <p> <p> " I 'm okay , Evelyn , " I said , wiping blood from my chin . <p> <p> " What did he do ? " <p> <p> " Out of the way , now . " <p> <p> We reached her , and Sever straight- armed her back into her apartment . Her head snapped forward , and the glasses she wore around her neck on a beaded chain flew up , trailing her fall like the tail of a kite . As we whisked past , I caught a flash of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair , the door pressing against her side . It was just a shove , nothing drastic , but even a portion of a man 's strength applied brusquely to a woman in her sixties had a certain grotesqueness to it . <p> <p> I tried to stop , but the agents propelled me forward . <p> <p> " Hey , " I said to Sever 's broad back , " let me at least make sure she 's okay . " <p> <p> The agents kept moving me along . No time for retorts or even threats . That scared me even more . <p> <p> I stumbled down the stairs , trying to keep pace , nearly dropping my sneakers . The lobby was empty save the vinyl couches and smoky mirrors , and beyond , the street was lit up like day . Police cars , spotlights , men in dark suits talking into their wrists . A few spectators , hastily dressed , stood on the opposite sidewalk , straining on tiptoes , waiting to see who would emerge . <p> <p> We burst through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the other , pulling on my Pumas . <p> <p> " Cut the goddamned spotlights , " Wydell said . " This is n't a fashion shoot . " The spotlights clicked off with a bass echo , and suddenly the night was darker than it should have been . Wydell grabbed the arm of another agent . " Where is it ? " <p> <p> " Almost here . " <p> <p> " It needs to be here now . " <p> <p> I said , loudly , " Are you gon na tell me what the hell is going on ? " <p> <p> All of a sudden , a bass thrumming filled the night , as much a vibration as a sound , and then a Steven Spielberg glow came over the rooftops , turning the palms a fiery yellow . On the sidewalk a little girl white- knuckled her father 's hand , her mouth open in sleepy disbelief . <p> <p> A Black Hawk loomed into view , massive and somehow futuristic in this context , on my street . The wind from the rotors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clothes to me . Wydell 's tie pulled clear of his jacket and stood on end . The helicopter banked and set down magisterially on the asphalt . The spectators stared at me in expectation . <p> <p> Wydell grabbed my arm in a vise grip and started moving me toward the The helicopter . The sight of that waiting Black Hawk finally broke me out of shock , or at least helped me catch up to myself , to what was happening . I jerked free . " Wait a minute . You ca n't just take me . What 's happening here ? " <p> <p> I had to follow him closely to hear his words over the noise of the rotors . <p> <p> He was shouting . " A terrorist has penetrated the nuclear power plant at San Onofre and is threatening to blow it up . " <p> <p> I felt a sudden hollowness at my core , that rushing emptiness I 'd felt only twice before : clutching stupidly at Frank while he died and watching live footage as that second plane hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jesus . But what 's that got to do with me ? " <p> <p> Wydell stopped , poised , one leg up on the skid of the chopper . " He says he 'll only talk to you .
