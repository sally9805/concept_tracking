In the past two weeks , 21 civilians have died in the minefields of the Shomali Plain north of Kabul . Everyone knows about the mines . This was the front line between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance , and the road is flanked by red warning stones . But now the Taliban has gone , and people displaced by the war are moving back to the plain . " They know what the red stones mean , but they are going back for economic reasons , " says Rafik Hayaty of the mine-clearing group Halo Trust , which put down the stones . " We can not physically stop them . " <P> There is a saying in Afghanistan : " Fear is the brother of death . " After 22 years of war , Afghans have learned to deal with fear the hard way : they have raised their threshold of danger . Whether it be walking through mined areas to collect wood or stray animals , or standing above the trench lines while bullets are pinging through the air , Afghans have redefined levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> With the killing last week of a Swedish journalist during a robbery in the northern Afghan town of Taloqan , a total of eight foreign reporters have died in Afghanistan in the past month . The danger to journalists ratcheted up last week with reports that Mullah Mohammed Omar , the leader of the Taliban , had offered a $50,000 reward for the death of any Western journalist . Since Tuesday no vehicles have been allowed closer than a quarter mile from the Inter-Continental Hotel in Kabul , where many journalists are staying , after the hotel received a " credible threat " of a planned bomb attack . <P> Afghans have been sympathetic about the deaths of the journalists but not shocked . " During these last years , we have seen a lot of bodies on our streets , so we are a little bit used to danger , " said Ataullah Rauf , a professor of education at Kabul University . Some 2 million Afghans have died in the wars since 1979 . Everyone has lost family members to Soviet bombs , mujahedin rockets or Taliban fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travel outside major towns has become particularly perilous . A minibus that was traveling last Thursday between Moqor and Ghazni , some 150 miles southwest of Kabul , was chased for 10 miles on the road by bandits firing rifles from a pickup . The bus escaped , but the passengers were shaken . " These men will steal anything , even your scarf , " said a man on the bus . In many towns basic levels of security have broken down . In Jalalabad grain sent by the World Food Program is sitting in warehouses ; conditions are too dangerous to distribute the food . <P> Everyday exposure to danger has hardened Afghans . " I have changed a lot , " says Mohammed Zarif Azhar , a professor of political science at Kabul University . " When the mujahedin started rocketing Kabul in 1992 , I was scared by each explosion . I would shout for help if I found someone bleeding on the road . But now if I see a dying person , I do n't care . I just walk by . " Mines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are injured or killed by explosions every day in Afghanistan . But somehow , life goes on . Two weeks ago , a landlord in Kabul rented a house to an American TV network . One problem : he knew there was an unexploded 500-lb. bomb stuck in a kitchen closet . The TV crew had already moved in when U.N . mine clearers arrived and found the bomb . That 's the Afghan way . <P>  --  By Terry McCarthy/Kabul
