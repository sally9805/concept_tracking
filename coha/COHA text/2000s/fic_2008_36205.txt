" Meg , are you busy ? " Dad asked . <p> I did n't turn around . The iron rod heating in my forge was approaching white hot , which meant it was the perfect temperature for working . So instead of answering , I gripped the rod with my tongs , pulled it out , slapped it onto the anvil with a satisfying clang , and began hammering one end into a point . Okay , I confess , I showboated a bit , just to emphasize how very busy I was . I worked faster than I normally would , with just a little flourish as I turned the rod , left , right , left , right , over and over , shaping the point . Then I moved an inch and a half back and began shaping and narrowing another area . <p> When I 'd done as much as I could without heating the metal again , I plunged the rod abruptly into the water bucket , sending up a cloud of faintly acrid steam . I closed my eyes as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it was n't the odor I found soothing . When you 're feeling annoyed , whacking things with a two-pound hammer works infinitely better than counting to ten . <p> " Yeah , " I said . " I 'm busy . " I turned to see both Dad and Dr. Blake standing in the doorway of the barn where I 'd set up my smithy . Technically , I was allowed to call Dr. Blake " Grandpa " now that the DNA tests had proved he was Dad 's long-lost father , but that would take some getting used to , so for the moment I went to great lengths not to call him anything at all . <p> I pulled the iron rod out of the bucket , held it up and sighted along the shaft . The end I 'd been working on had now taken on a shape like a rough spear point . I smiled at the smooth , flat surfaces , with just enough faint dimpling to prove that they had been hammered on a forge rather than poured in some factory . Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good start on having a productive Monday morning . <p> " That 's not finished , is it ? " Dr. Blake asked . <p> My mellow mood evaporated . <p> " No , of course not , " I said . <p> " What is it ? " he asked . " Some kind of primitive boar spear ? " <p> " A towel rod . This is only step one of a five-or six-step process . When it 's finished , it will look like this . " <p> I strode over to the section of the barn where I stored completed work and picked up a towel rod made of a single iron bar hammered into a graceful curve with a curling leaf on each end . <p> " The part that looks like a spear point is what I 'm going to turn into the leaf on this end , " I said . <p> " Oh , I understand , " Blake said , in a falsely hearty tone that suggested he did n't understand at all . <p> " She sold a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lieutenant governor , actually , " I said . " And it was his wife doing the shopping . " <p> " Nice , " Blake said . I suppressed a sigh . I could tell he was trying , but since my work had nothing to do with zoology or the preservation of endangered species , his own particular obsessions , he was having a hard time . <p> " Still , " Blake went on . " Think of all the time you could save if you could find a way to automate some of those steps . You could make ten times as many iron doodads in the same time . And more cheaply , I expect . " <p> " That 's not the point , " I said . " It 's handmade . It 's not like every cookie-cutter towel bar you can buy down at the hardware store . Every one is unique . " <p> " Unique , handmade  --  I suppose they 're nice , but look how labor-intensive this is . " <p> " Yes , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals down at your zoo . Think of all the time you could save if you just freeze-dried and stuffed them all . No need for feedings several times a day , cleaning the cages , hauling them to and from the vet  --  just dust them off every few weeks . You could probably take care of ten times as many animals with the same staff . And more cheaply . " <p> " That 's not the point , " Blake said . <p> " So you 're busy , then ? " Dad asked  --  probably to change the subject and keep the peace . Blake was frowning at me . Did he disapprove of my sarcasm ? Surely he did n't think I was serious about taxidermying the zoo 's inhabitants ? <p> " Very busy , " I said . " The cupboard is nearly bare . " I swept my arm in a dramatic half circle to indicate how very large the storage end of the barn was , and then fixed my gaze on the pitifully small pile of finished metalwork in one corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking his head in sympathy . <p> " And I 'm scheduled to do that really big craft show over the Labor Day weekend , " I said . " Only three weeks away . What with all the distractions I 've had this summer , I have n't had nearly as much time to work as I thought I would . " <p> " Hmph ! " Blake snorted . " Does young Michael know you consider your wedding and honeymoon distractions ? " <p> I ignored him . <p> " We wo n't bother you , then , " Dad said . " But can we use your shed ? " <p> " Which one ? " I asked . " And for what ? " The three-acre property Michael and I had bought contained not only an enormous Victorian house and a two-story barn but also a bumper crop of small sheds and outbuildings in various states of disintegration . <p> " Any one you 're not using , " Dad said . " Do n't you want us to tell you about our project ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an interminable one . <p> " Later , " I said . " Pick a shed as far from the house as possible . " If both Dad and Dr. Blake were involved , they almost certainly wanted the shed for some project related to birds or animals from the small local zoo that Blake had recently bought . " Down-wind , if that 's likely to be a problem . And I 'm not doing any midnight feedings . " <p> " Oh , of course not , " Dad said . " Thanks ! " <p> Blake nodded his thanks and dashed off without speaking . Dad lingered . <p> " Something else ? " I asked . <p> " He does n't mean to be insulting , " Dad said . <p> " No , but he manages it quite brilliantly . " <p> " It would help if you 'd show an interest in some of his projects , " Dad said . <p> " There 's a difference between showing an interest and letting him take over my life , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me . " <p> " Wolverines are really quite sweet at that age . " <p> " And require feeding every hour with an eyedropper , " I said . " No thanks . I 'm letting you use one of the sheds  --  try to convince him that 's a sign of profound interest in whatever you two are doing . " <p> Dad shook his head and followed Dr. Blake . <p> I picked up the iron rod and stuck it back in the forge . <p> It had barely begun to redden when my brother Rob ambled into the forge holding a leash . <p> " Hey , Meg , " he said . " Mind if I borrow Spike ? " <p> " I do n't mind if you take him off our hands permanently , " I said . Technically Spike , an eight-and-a-half-pound furball with delusions of Rottweilerhood , belonged to my mother-in-law , but Michael and I had had custody ever since her allergist recommended a trial separation . We 'd grown used to having him around , but I still cherished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spike and insist on adopting him . So far , Rob was the only possible candidate , and Rob was n't responsible enough to be trusted with a pet rock . <p> " No , I just want him for the afternoon . " Rob strolled over to the indoor pen where Spike usually snoozed while I worked , and climbed over the fence . <p> " Just do n't let anything happen to him or Michael 's mother will kill you , " I said , turning back to my forge . <p> " No problem . " I heard the small scuffle as he cornered Spike and a muffled ouch as he failed to avoid getting bitten . I was pulling the hot iron rod out by the time he led Spike through the gate . He stopped to watch . <p> I did n't rush it this time , because I was performing the slightly more complicated job of spreading the point at the end of the rod and working it into a rough leaf shape . Sometimes it took me two heatings to finish the transformation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaf , plunged it into the water bucket , and drew it out to examine . <p> " That 's so cool , " Rob said . <p> " Thanks , " I said . I sloshed a dipper full of water over the rod , to cool the parts that had been above the water line . My good mood was returning . <p> " I could never do that in a million years . I think you 're so lucky to have a creative outlet . " <p> I frowned slightly . Rob did n't usually lay it on this thick unless he had an ulterior motive . <p> " Something else you wanted ? " I asked . <p> " No  --  what do you mean ? " <p> From the expression of utter innocence on his face , I deduced that Rob did , indeed , want something , but had decided now was not the right time to ask me . <p> Just then Spike lunged toward the forge , barking wildly . He hated all large mechanical objects , but seemed to feel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise it made sounded like growling to him . We 'd built his holding pen after the third time he 'd nearly flambTed himself while trying to attack the forge . <p> " Go find something his own size for Spike to pick on , " I said . As Rob and Spike sauntered out , I thrust the rod back into the forge for the third time . Should I start heating another rod or two ? It was more efficient to have several pieces going at once , working on one while the others were in various stages of heating . No , I decided I 'd rather work up to a good rhythm before I started to multitask . After all , I had all day . Michael was at the college , attending more of the interminable faculty meetings that filled the weeks before Labor Day and everyone else who wanted me for anything would just have to take " I 'm busy " for an answer . <p> I pulled the rod out , picked up the cross peen hammer , and began the next  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strokes that flattened the iron and gave the impression of the veining that ran through the leaf . Again , I managed the job in a single heating  --  I was definitely in good form today . I held up the leaf and was nodding with satisfaction when  --  <p> " Oh , Meg ! Thank God you 're here ! I need your help ! " <p> I jumped and accidentally hit the leaf with my hammer . The metal was in that awkward stage , still hot enough to cause third degree burns , but not hot enough to be flexible . The leaf cracked off and dropped to the ground , landing on a few leaves and bits of straw that sizzled when it touched them . I grabbed the dipper and doused the area before looking up at my newest interrupter . <p> I saw a petite , plump woman with short , blond hair in a pixie cut , wearing jeans and a pale blue t-shirt with a faded Caerphilly College logo . She looked vaguely familiar , but it took me several embarrassingly long moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Karen ? " I said finally . " I did n't recognize you with the new haircut . " The last time I 'd seen her , she could sit down on the end of her long , thick , wavy blond mane . The fact that she 'd gained a good thirty pounds since our last meeting did n't help with recognition either . <p> " Oh , I know , " she said , ruffling the hair with a sheepish look . " Ever since I had Timmy , I just could n't seem to find the time to take care of it . " <p> I nodded . Odds were Timmy was also the reason for the thirty pounds , not that I was going to mention it . Just because I was currently winning the diet battle did n't mean I could n't understand someone who was having a harder time . <p> " And then when Jasper ran out on us , I decided the hell with it . I 'm going to make things easier for me , and never mind what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right , " I said , nodding . Jasper had run out on Karen and baby Timmy ? Had I forgotten that , or had it been longer than I remembered since I 'd seen Karen ? <p> Apparently I did n't do a very good job of concealing my surprise . <p> " I 'll tell you all about it later , " she said . " But right now  --  could you do me a big favor ? " <p> " Sure , " I said . " If I can . " <p> " Could you take care of Timmy ? Just for a little while ? I need to do something without him along . And my day care lady had to go out of town yesterday because of a death in the family and there just is n't anyone else I can trust . Do n't worry ; he wo n't be any trouble ; he 's a little angel . Wait ; I 'll show you . " <p> She dashed out the door and then returned , pushing a large stroller . A blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with chocolate and he was clutching a small green blanket and a ratty black stuffed toy . <p> " Is n't he adorable ? " She smoothed a lock of his hair that had n't been out of place . <p> Yes , he was adorable . Of course , he was also fast asleep . Even Spike looked adorable while asleep . And it must have been longer than I thought since I 'd last seen Karen . Timmy was much bigger than I expected . At least two years old . Maybe three if he was small for his age . My youngest nephew was twelve now , but I remembered what he and his siblings had been like at that age . Angelic would n't exactly be the word I 'd choose to describe them . <p> " I know it 's an imposition , " Karen said . I looked up to find her staring at my face with an expression of desperation , almost panic . " There just is n't anyone else I can trust . Meg , please , take care of Timmy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But what 's going on , anyway ? You seem  --  " <p> " Timmy , honey ! " Karen said . I glanced down to see that Timmy had awakened . <p> " You remember Aunt Meg , do n't you , Timmy ? " Karen cooed . <p> I did n't think it likely , myself , and Timmy did n't waste much time trying to place me . His bright little eyes were already busily exploring the surroundings and he was squirming as if the rest of him could n't wait to follow . <p> I glanced around and felt a sharp twinge of protective anxiety about my workspace . " Let 's go up to the house , " I said . " This really is n't the best place to turn a kid loose . " <p> " Good idea , " Karen said . The protectiveness on her face was aimed at Timmy , but at least we saw eye to eye about the fact that Timmy and my blacksmithing tools were not a match made in heaven . <p> " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . As Karen wheeled Timmy out , I turned off the gas to my forge and looked from it to my still depleted stock of merchandise . <p> " Just for a little while , " I said , echoing Karen 's words . I allowed myself to feel a moment of resentment that something was interrupting me just as I was finally settling down to do some real work . <p> But a shriek from outside broke into my moment of self pity , and I rushed out to see what was wrong . <p> Excerpted from Cockatiels at Seven by Donna Andrews <p> Copyright 2008 by Donna Andrews <p> Published in 2008 by Thomas Dunne Books , St. Martin
