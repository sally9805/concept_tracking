<p> A VOTER OUT OF STEP WITH THE BAY AREA <p> Editor  --  The first sentence of a recent article by Carl Nolte ( " Voters in the Bay Area Are the Contrarians of California , " March 10 ) is a perfect example of why the rest of the country , including the rest of California , makes such fun of San Francisco and the Bay Area . I have never encountered such egocentric and narcissistic thinking . You people really think you 're enlightened , do n't you ? Mr. Nolte asks , " . . . Why is the rest of the country out of step with the Bay Area ? " I 've got some sobering news for you , Mr. Nolte . The Bay Area is grossly out of step with the rest of the country , not the other way around . When I return to visit my family ( in Georgia ) or go on business to other parts of the country , I never tell them I live in the Bay Area ( Benicia )  --  they would immediately discount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . They automatically assume that I am insane and out of touch with the real world as is San Francisco . But I do n't expect you to understand this . You 're from San Francisco . <p> MARK F. FRY <p> Benicia <p> INTERTWINED ISSUES <p> Editor  --  Eleanor Dick ( Letters , March 11 ) believes that voters should ignore such issues as " pro-choice " and campaign-finance reform , focusing solely on environmental issues when selecting a candidate . <p> Simple ? Not really , since these three issues in particular are intertwined . The recent disasters of Honduras , Bangladesh and now Africa are almost entirely due to the denuding of forests in the face of population explosions . Environmental degradation is directly related to overpopulation . Giving women the choice to control their fecundity through U.S. governmental aid to international family planning agencies has been denied by past Republican administrations and certainly will be in the immediate future . <p> As for campaign-finance reform , the polluters and degraders of the environment will lobby ( read money ) all of our legislators to prevent real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is one of the worst-polluted states in the country , has recently created clean air legislation . However , Gov . George W. Bush has made sure that the requirements were only voluntary . <p> ANNE SPANIER <p> Oakland <p> REFORMING THE GOP <p> Editor  --  Sen. John McCain 's cry for campaign-finance reform rallied millions to the polls . It is a mistake for him to end his run for president . Since the Republican Party needs as much reform as the Democratic Party , it would seem wise for Sen. McCain to run as a New Republican or Reform Republican Party . <p> History has shown that true reform parties with support from the people bring about great reform , such as the end of slavery . Perhaps McCain is the herald for the reform of the Republican Party . ( Call it the Reform Republican Party . ) He has nothing to lose and much to gain by making campaign-finance reform his rallying cry . And he will have done all Americans an immeasurable service whether he wins or loses . <p> Running for president is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of all Americans for the common good . I hope McCain comes back into the race . His voice for campaign-finance reform will be better heard if he stays in the running . <p> CAROLE GRAPPO <p> Oakland <p> THE $8 GALLON <p> Editor  --  The real cost of gasoline is closer " on average " to $8 a gallon when all of the direct and indirect public subsidies and other associated down-the-road costs are included . <p> So if the " oil-producing states " can artificially regulate petroleum supplies to affect pricing , why can not a free and democratic people , the real and ultimate owners of our marketplace , regulate gas prices to artificially affect supply ? <p> If Congress or the state Legislature is unable or unwilling to do the job , just put it on the ballot . Let " We , the People , " decide if establishing a gas price ceiling ( with annual increases limited to cost of living or inflation rates ) based on historic regional price averages is fair . <p> Or perhaps inflated gas prices is a none too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $125 billion Congress gives away of our money in direct corporate-welfared government checks to unneedy highly profitable corporations every year ? <p> Regardless of whether we fairly regulate gas prices this time around , this is a good time to reflect on the rate of transportation in California and America . <p> By not investing substantively in automobile and petroleum dependent transport alternatives we merely ensure that highly uncompetitive and inflated auto-related prices and costs will be the only item on our transportation cafe lunch menu . <p> May n't we will all be better off to diversify our one-note transportation monoculture ? Even we auto addicts will benefit when everyone has safe and efficient auto alternatives available . Enlightened self-interest , anyone ? <p> RAND KNOX <p> San Rafael <p> FABRIC OF THE CITY <p> Editor  --  I am both surprised and distressed that the family of Peter Gardner felt that my response of February 26 to Ken Garcia 's feature article was personally directed at Mr. Gardner . My letter was not intended to indict any individual for bigotry as none was named and I thought that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardner was a righteous man , as well as others of his generation who also could be excepted and whose families deserve an apology , which I am willing to give if I offended them . Unfortunately , individuals like Mr. Gardner did not constitute a critical mass ( enough to influence opinion ) during the period in question and that was the problem . <p> I wanted to point out that not all San Franciscans could fully participate in helping to weave this great city 's fabric during that time . If more individuals who formed the city 's backbone had spoken out against bigotry by their votes or interactions with family , friends and neighbors , things would have been better . The passing of a generation must include the deaths of both the good and the bad . While I can not find comfort in the deaths of either , I can not mourn the passing of the bad . <p> ARTHUR LATHAN <p> San Francisco <p> LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE <p> Editor  --  As predictable as Fox Television , every execution The Chronicle gives graphic , front-page descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vengeful victims families , and a prurient countdown to the state 's executioner doing his/her deed in the death chamber at San Quentin . <p> There is an alternative to the death penalty , Life Sentence Without Possibility of Parole ( LWOP ) , although you clearly do n't like to cover it . There 's no blood , no drama , no last meals or appeals to the Supreme Court . Quietly , effectively , more than 2,300 murderers in California have been given LWOP since 1977 . Not one has been released . <p> KRISTIN VORHIES SKINNER <p> Albany <p> ADS INVADE PARADE <p> Editor  --  Our city 's Sunday St. Patrick 's Day Parade exposed a trend many in attendance found disturbing . <p> Dot-com companies shamelessly advertising their products while making a pitiful attempt at disguising their intentions by driving green VW Bugs . Nice try . <p> Parades are not for advertising ; rather they are , and have always been , to honor and cheer a particular group or event and/or the accomplishments realized by such . <p> It is insulting to the intelligence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting a few hours away from commercial intrusion . <p> One would expect the bars and beer companies to exploit such events , but at least they did not invade the parade itself . <p> Event organizers have crossed the proverbial line between good , clean fun and big business . If this trend continues , they can expect turnout to appropriately decline . <p> DENNIS LAWLOR <p> San Francisco <p> SMILES IN THE SKY <p> Editor  --  Thank you , thank you , three bags full , to the anonymous pilot of the yellow biplane , who sky-drew the half-mile diameter smiley face above Vallejo late Sunday afternoon . It was the perfect ending to a beautiful spring-like day . <p> MICHAEL HAWORTH <p> Vallejo
