The Key to A Slim Body // " Before I started Jorge 's program , my weight was out of control . I looked in the mirror and saw a huge , short , fat person . I hated buying clothes . I was tired and had no energy . I started Jorge 's plan and I have lost 56 pounds so far and dropped four sizes . This program has shown me that even with five kids and a busy schedule , I can succeed with weight loss . Best of all , I did not have to give up the foods that I like . This plan is simple to follow . Thanks , Jorge ! " - Brenda Johnson - Lost 56 Pounds // Today , 65 percent of all Americans are overweight . This is n't just an American problem . Half of the people who live in the UK are overweight , too . It 's an epidemic . Despite the abundance of diet books , pills , and programs , people are getting fatter . Obviously , the current dieting regimens are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Centers of Disease Control , more than 300,000 Americans die each year from obesity-related illness . This means each day more than 800 Americans die from problems related to obesity . This means every 5 minutes 3 people die . Twenty years ago , only 4 percent of American children were overweight . Today , that number has swelled to 15 percent - and it 's growing larger by the day . On average , research shows Americans are gaining 1 to 2 pounds a year . Nine out of ten people who lose weight on a fad diet gain it all back within a year . // So here 's the question : " Why are you unable to successfully lose and keep the weight off ? " I wanted to know the answer to this question . So I studied the effects of many different diets and questioned thousands of my most successful online clients . // This is what I learned . Do you want to know why YOU ca n't lose weight and keep it off ? Well , you wo n't find the answer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup diet , or any other fad diet . Yep , it 's not there . In fact , these diets actually make you fatter in the long term . ( You 'll learn more about why and how in chapters 2 and 3 . ) Starving yourself and cutting out your favorite foods never works . If you 've ever tried such deprivation diets , you know this already . With every fad diet you tried , you may have lost weight , only to hit a plateau and then gain it all back and more too . // Indeed , the answer lies in something much simpler , much easier to implement in your life , and much more enjoyable to tackle . It lies in a dieting secret that has worked for many years for my most successful online clients - and for many other people as well . When I studied my most successful clients , I learned that the secret to dieting success lies in a revolutionary concept : timing . Yes , timing . You see , the secret to losing weight and keeping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . It centers on when you eat . // Specifically , it 's not allowing more than 3 hours to pass without eating . Not every 5 hours or every 2 hours , but rather ideally every 3 hours . Why every 3 hours ? Research study after research study confirmed the power of 3 hours . You see , if you allow more than 3 hours to pass between meals , your body turns on its natural " starvation protection mechanism , " what I call your SPM . When your body 's SPM gets switched on , your body thinks that it 's in a famine . When this happens , your body does everything it can to preserve the most calorie-rich tissue in the body to ensure your survival . That tissue is body fat . Yes , your body begins to store fat and consumes precious fat-burning muscle instead . So now you might be losing weight on the scale , but you 're not losing the ideal kind of weight . You 're losing muscle instead of fat . // Why is losing lean muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting metabolism . Yep , lean muscle controls how many calories you burn when doing nothing ... when resting on the couch , driving your car , sitting at the computer , even when sleeping in your bed . Each pound of muscle burns approximately 50 calories every day just doing nothing . Lose just 5 pounds of muscle and your metabolism burns 250 calories less a day ; in the course of just one year that will equal 26 pounds of new fat ! // You see , the fat on your body is not the source of your problem . You may not like having the excess fat , but the fat is not to blame . It 's only the symptom . The true problem is the loss of lean muscle tissue from years of poor meal timing ( see chapter 5 ) and/or fad dieting ( see chapters 2 and 3 ) . And muscle loss equals a lowered resting metabolism and thus a life of chronic weight gain . // On the flip side , if you eat at the correct times , you " turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourages your body to burn fat without losing muscle . This preserves your resting metabolism and whamo ... you get and stay slim more easily ! // You may be wondering , " Is it just about eating every 3 hours ? Is that all there is to this diet plan ? " The answer is no . There is more . It 's all about what I call Visual Timing(tm) . What do I mean ? Visual Timing(tm) has two secrets . It 's all about creating an automatic eating schedule by being visually aware of : 1 ) when to eat and 2 ) how to eat without restricting food options - ever . Yep , you need to know how to easily eat without any restrictions on the food options you love . And my Visual Timing(tm) formula will ensure you eat automatically every 3 hours and not forget to eat . It will feel effortless . Depriving yourself of the foods you love leads to bingeing and failure in the long term . Chapters 5 and 6 will cover these two critical secrets . So get ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dieting . Get ready to start thinking about timing - when you eat . // ( Continues ... ) //
