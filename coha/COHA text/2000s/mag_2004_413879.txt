John Ford 's How Green Was My Valley would win the Academy Award for best picture that year . Baseball dominated the world of sports that summer as Bostons Ted Williams wore out the best pitchers in the American League , while in New York a fisherman 's son named Joe DiMaggio was carving out his own piece of immortality by hitting in 56 consecutive games . The economy had turned upward , and more people were going back to work . In general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain leered another reality . In Europe , Germany had conquered France , and Adolf Hitler 's one remaining foe , Britain , had lost a dangerous amount of its war materiel on the beaches at Dunkirk . In the North Atlantic , the U.S. Navy was escorting Allied ship convoys to protect them from U-boat attacks . In effect , the United States had entered an undeclared war with Germany . Relations with Japan were not much better . The country was preparing for the war that would mark my father 's generation forever . And so , three days before his 24th birthday , on August 21 , 1941 , John Pricer walked into a recruiting station in Des Moines , Iowa , and enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps . On August 23 , the record lists him as a private in the 2nd Recruit Battalion at the Marine recruit depot in San Diego . // After surviving an agonizing , watery quarter-mile slog from the outer reef under heavy Japanese fire , Marines find cover behind a knocked-out amtrac or whatever else the beach can offer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eby. // In fact , though , John Pricer was completely ill-fitted for Marine Corps basic training . He failed to qualify with the rifle , pistol and bayonet . Dad 's only comment about boot camp was , " It was ten weeks of bullshit and I was what they called a shithead . " Nevertheless , the Marines know how to make Marines . In November 1941 , John Pricer , despite his shithead status , qualified as a Marine . All it took was for the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor on December 7 , and his destiny was sealed . By September 15 , 1942 , he was a member of Company K , 3rd Battalion , 8th Marine Regiment ( K/3/8 ) . In August 1943 , U.S. Navy strategists began to develop plans for a push through the central Pacific . Success in this island-hopping campaign required establishing air superiority . To move toward Japan the Americans needed airfields . There were two options : spend time and build them , or spend lives and take them from the Japanese . When the invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence . That meant spending lives . The 2nd Marine Division , of which Pricer 's 8th Regiment was part , was ordered to capture the Japanese airfield on tiny Betio Island at Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands . It would not be easy . Japanese commanders , fully realizing the strategic importance of the Gilberts , meant to hold on tight to their airfield . To defend their highly strategic possession , they turned to the 1,247-strong 111th Pioneers and the 970 men-half of whom were conscripted Korean laborers-of the 4th Fleet Construction Unit . With a mix of sand , concrete , railroad ties , coconut logs and the then-vast sum of $1.7 million , these talented engineers impregnated Betio with a complex of fortifications that combined strength with resilience . Manning those defenses since March 1943 were 1,122 marine infantry ( rekusentai ) of the 3rd Special Base Force , later reinforced with 1,497 more , in the form of Commander Takeo Sugai 's elite Sasebo 7th Special Naval Landing Force . As he surveyed this showcase of defensive fortifications , the atoll 's commander , Rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " A million Americans could not take Betio in a hundred years . " Sunday , November 20,1943 , was debarkation day . Aboard the troopship USS Monrovia , the 3rd Battalion of the 8th Marines awoke in the pre-dawn darkness . After a traditional precombat meal of steak and eggs , they changed into clean uniforms to help prevent infection from soiled clothing , should any of them be wounded . A strange quiet prevailed in the hold 's eerie light . Almost half the men , including Dad , were veterans of Guadalcanal , and while there was anxiety , there were no overt displays of fear . The 3/8 was to be held in reserve for this battle . If they did go in , their assignment was supposed to have been the adjacent island of Bariki , where they were to wipe out the small contingent of Japanese and set up positions to repel any of the enemy escaping from the main assault on nearby Betio . Every combat veteran of Guadalcanal in the 3/8 knew this was good news , or at least as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private at the time , remembers it well . " We were told that after the Navy bombed Betio there would not be a Jap alive , " said the now-retired trucking executive . Down in the stifling heat belowdecks , Dad sweated with the rest of L Company . Finally their boat assignments were called , and the long climb up the labyrinth of ladders to the main deck began . Topside , hundreds of sailors and Marines bustled in the darkness . The air was filled with the sound of intercom systems and bullhorns issuing last minute instructions .

" " Now hear this-Marines report to the debarkation stations . " " Our Father who art in heaven ... " " Hail Mary full of grace , the Lord is with thee ... " Marines knelt in prayer and chaplains quietly blessed the young warriors , many of whom would be dead in a few short hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landing force . " Dad hitched up his gear , secured his rifle to his pack and scrambled over the gunwales with the rest of the Marines of L/3/8 . There was no turning back now . The 60-foot climb down the cargo nets to the Higgins boats below was perilous . The seas were churning waves between 2 and 4 feet high that Sunday morning , and the small boats slammed violently against the sides of the looming Monrovia . No one moved quickly under his heavy load . A Marine going into battle at Tarawa carried about 70 pounds of gear , including his M1 Garand rifle and bayonet , four hand grenades , 125 rounds of ammunition , rations and water for three days , a bedding roll , an inflatable rubber life preserver around his waist , a gas mask , toilet articles , three pairs of socks and underwear , his entrenching tool , a first-aid kit , and 15 packs of cigarettes in individual waterproof bags . Some men carried even more equipment and literally had to be helped to their feet in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fell into the water , never to be seen again . To the shouted warnings of " Keep your hands on the vertical ropes " ( so the men above would not step on their fingers ) , the Marines inched like clumsy insects three abreast toward the bobbing boats below . Finally loaded , the landing craft began the endless circling in rendezvous , waiting for the other assault waves to form up . While they were circling , the sun rose to illuminate a beautiful tropical morning with white clouds in the bright blue sky over a truly awesome sight-hundreds of warships , battle flags snapping from the mastheads in the warm Pacific trade winds . All the power of a mighty navy was being brought to bear on a tiny islet no bigger than New York 's Central Park . Plan A at Tarawa was for the Navy to bomb and shell Betio so thoroughly that the Marines could walk in and occupy it with little resistance . " We will obliterate it ! " said Rear Adm . Howard F. Kingman . Major Henry P. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 8th Marines , was so confident that he told his men all they would need was a piece of chalk and a bayonet-the chalk to mark the spot on the Jap and the bayonet to stick him . The first assault waves were to go in on LVTs ( landing vehicles , tracked ) , penetrate the Japanese perimeter , then drive toward the airfield . The rest were to follow in the untracked Higgins boats . If the tide was too low for the shallow-draft Higgins boats to cross the reef , the men were to transfer to the returning LVTs and be ferried to their respective landing zones on shore . Things started out well enough . As the Japanese defenders watched , the LVTs reached the reef and the drivers shifted into overland gear , gunned the engines and climbed over the coral shelf , then chugged toward the beach . The naval shelling of Betio had been thoroughly merciless . The island 's surface was literally a smoking moon-scape ; communications had been completely knocked out , and Japanese troops had been hammered into a stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A gallant and fanatical foe , the rikusentai remained hunkered down in their pillboxes and bunkers . Photograph Marine reinforcements , heavily laden with equipment , climb down netting to their landing craft before joining their beleaguered comrades on the Betio beachhead. // Then the artillery maelstrom was suspended as the assault waves approached the beach . This respite gave the Japanese just enough time to catch their breath and sight their guns . By the time the first waves of LVTs were in range , the defenders of Fortress Betio were ready to give some back to the Americans . They opened fire with a disciplined , savage vengeance . Al told , however , the first waves managed to put 1,500 Marines on the beach within about 15 minutes , with acceptable casualties . Then the wheels came off . As the Japanese gunners found the range , they began sighting in on the remaining LVTs with murderous accuracy . In the meantime , the coxswains in the Higgins boats had made a chilling discovery . The tide was lower than expected , too low to negotiate the reef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly diminishing , there was no way to ferry the remaining Marines to the beach . Their only choice was to dump the Marines on the reef , where they were fully exposed to the blistering fire . The slaughter had begun . While all this was going on , Dad was circling 10 miles offshore with the rest of the 3rd Battalion . They had no way of knowing that all was not well on the beaches . Then the commanding officer ashore , Colonel David M. Shoup , called for reinforcements . Landing team 3/8 was ordered to the line of departure . Major Robert H. Rudd , commander of the 3/8 , got his orders at 10:18 a.m. he organized his battalion into seven waves , with K Company in the lead and Dad 's Company L to its left and slightly behind . The companies formed up adjacent to the minesweeper Pursuit , which served as the marker boat At 11:07 a.m. , they crossed the line of departure and moved for the beach . The assault of 3/8 has been described as one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wept openly at what they were forced to witness . Historian Joseph Alexander , a retired U.S. Marine colonel , described the assault of 3/8 like this : " Japanese anti-boat guns zeroed in on the landing craft with frightful accuracy , often hitting just as the bow ramp dropped . Survivors reported the distinctive " clang " as a shell impacted a split second before the explosion . Some Navy coxswains , seeing the slaughter just ahead , stopped their boats seaward of the reef and ordered the troops off . The Marines , many loaded with radios or extra ammunition sank immediately in the deep water . Most drowned . Seventy percent fell attempting to reach the beach . " Michael B. Graham , in Mantle of Heroism , described what happened to the first waves : " As the boat waves approached they came under rapid 20mm and 40mm fire . They were still closing on the reef when-WHAM ! -a thunderous crack near the tail end of the island was heard . Marines ashore , stunned , moved instinctively closer to the protection of the seawall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a strange sound , like the noise of a " steel girder hitting concrete , " said United Press correspondent Richard Johnston , reverberated across the lagoon . The noise , recalled Johnston , " pierced the ears , above the howling fury of the battle , and echoed for seconds . ' Out in the blue water , the westernmost Higgins boat disappeared . Quite literally . It had been there and suddenly it was not . In its place for a split second there was a blur in the air , and then there was nothing . " Platoon Sergeant Darrell " Bud " Albers of K/3/8 was in the first wave . Albers was only 15 yards away when the lead boat was hit . " We were in the middle boat of the first wave of three boats . The boats were about 15 yards apart . The one next to ours , number 1-1 , took a direct hit . There were some demolition guys on it and they were carrying charges that were 60 percent dynamite ....

" I admit with no shame that I was in complete shock , " said Jim Crumpacher , now a retired third-grade schoolteacher . " All I could think about was keeping my cigarettes dry . I had wrapped them in some oilcloth to protect them . When we got in the water I could see the Jap machine gun bullets as they skimmed off the water . They were sweeping from front to back . I timed it so that before they got to me ducked under and walked under the water . If they had fired from back to front they would have killed us all .

When we hit the reef the water was about waist deep . I had a tin box of cigarettes in my shirt pocket and they floated away from me in the water . As I reached for them a bullet hit them . After that everything got clear . Up to that point it was all real hazy . We were walking point blank into antiboat guns and machine guns . Guys were getting picked off all around me . They told us that if you got hit to go back to the boat . Guys would call to me that they were hit . I had to yell for them to work their way back to the boat . I saw people go over to them and try and help them . But when they did , the tracers would converge on them and hit them too . For years I felt guilty that I could n't help them . It was awful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on the reef . We worked our way over to the pier . It was our only cover . On the way I ran into a fraternity brother of mine from college , Karl Hoffman . I yelled , " How the hell do we get out of this ? ' " Beats the hell out of me ! see ya later , ' he answered . " Private Jack Quinn ( L/3/8 ) waded across the lagoon in the same wave as Dad . " When we got to the reef we had about 500 yards to walk , " Quinn told me . " The Japs were in bunkers no more than 100 yards from the beach . When the ramp lowered into the water , the only thing that saved my ass was one little Italian guy . He looked at me and said , " Where should we go ? " I motioned toward the pier . He stepped in front of me and was about 10 yards away when a heavy machine gun tore into him . He was cut completely in half from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood and floated between two other dead guys , like I was dead . I could touch the bottom with my hands and I sort of crawled and waded over to the pier . I do n't even know how we finally got ashore . " In the midst of the fury and carnage , Dad jumped out of his boat with his fellow messmates : " I lost all of my equipment , " he said , noting that it was too heavy to carry and swim at the same time . " We just tried to keep going and eventually made it ashore . There were dead Marines everywhere . We had to wade through them . I 'll never forget that as long as I live . " His battalion was shot to pieces . Of the first wave , only 30 percent reached shore . Of Dad 's wave , the second , only 20 percent .

We lost some sure enough good Marines , but not one man faltered . Not one head turned the other way . There were none braver . " On the beach confusion reigned . " There was absolutely no organization , " recalled Quinn . " No one could fight as a cohesive unit . We were just pinned down on the beach . There was a guy next to me who was hit four times as we lay there . Every time he moved the sniper shot him again . We could n't see the bastard to shoot back . There were a couple of officers next to us . The one captain yelled at the lieutenant to get these guys off the beach .

" Photograph A member of the 8th Marines gets a moment of rest in a shallow foxhole as the slow , savage advance across Betio nears its end . // Dad , along with many others , struggled to the beach unarmed . In K Company , only one Marine in five had managed to get a weapon ashore and L Company was n't much better . Every Marine is first and foremost a rifleman and a fighter . For a Marine to lose his rifle is unthinkable . For nearly 80 percent of those Marines to wade ashore without their weapons is testimony to the ferocity of the fire they were under . Nothing was moving forward . " I remember looking behind me , " Dad said . " There were dead everywhere ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a football field . We just lay on the beach . There was nowhere to go . We could n't move and we could not fight . People were getting shot where they lay and men were crying and dying everywhere . " The Battle of Tarawa lasted 76 hours . Finally , on November 23 , 1943 , Betio was declared secure . The tiny island had been reduced to a charnel house . The cloying heat and stench were so bad that Navy pilots reported becoming sick and vomiting as they flew over the island . Below , those still living were in an almost inhuman state . Covered with the filth of war and stressed to the breaking point , most had gone without sleep and food for the entire time ashore . Eleven hundred thirteen Marines died and 2,290 were wounded . Almost 5,000 Japanese were killed ; only 17 were taken prisoners . We do not know for sure when Dad came off the island . At various times he has recalled it in different ways . Apparently , confusion like this is normal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories and memories often clash . It is reasonable to assume that he was in serious shock , and after so many years his memory is bound to be jumbled . In any case , he was back on board Monrovia with what was left of L Company when the ship sailed for Hawaii . " When we got back on the ship Admiral Chester W. Nimitz came on the loudspeakers and congratulated us for our victory , " he said . " I could n't accept his congratulations . There were one thousand dead Marines on the beach . What the hell was there to be congratulated about ? " The return trip , as described in Wilbur Jones ' Gyrene , was no pleasure cruise : " For the 2nd Marine Division the 2,000 mile voyage was in itself a postscript to horror . The transports reeked of the awful smell of the island , of disinfectant , and of blood . There were no fresh clothes for the surviving Marines , and almost everyone had lost his gear . Every day there were the funerals at sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled into Hilo in the Territory of Hawaii . There , it offloaded the wounded before moving on to the Big Island of Hawaii . At the Parker Ranch on the Big Island , the Marines of the 2nd Division pitched their tents at the newly established Camp Tarawa and settled in to rest up for the next campaign . The relentless shelling and vicious jungle fighting at Guadalcanal , the constant bouts with malaria and mumu , and , of course , the unspeakable horrors of Tarawa became too much for my father . Dad was hospitalized for a time in Hawaii , and , we are told , was in such a severe state of neurosis that he actually attempted suicide . When I asked him about it he was direct and to the point . " I crapped out , " he said . " I had a complete nervous breakdown . It was battle fatigue . I was evaluated and sent home .

As a boy , I can clearly remember watching him as he lay on the sofa and shivered uncontrollably with malaria chills . And when he was in his late 50s , the deterioration of his retinas that caused his blindness was traced to his use of Atabrine , an anti-malaria drug he had taken on Guadalcanal . His reluctance to be with people , his aversion to noise , his need to never be hungry , his chronic nervousness were all results of his experiences as a Marine . In the jungles of Guadalcanal , in the lagoon at Tarawa , and in subsequent daily travails of family life , he did not falter . He raised us all the best he could .
