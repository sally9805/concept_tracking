Chapter One AS SOON AS I WALK IN , the woman gives me the eye . This is not quite as promising a situation as it sounds . First of all , I 'm in a Laundromat . The actual name is the Law-dromat , owned by my associate Kevin Randall . Kevin uses this business to emotionally , as well as literally , cleanse himself of the rather grimy things we 're exposed to in our criminal law practice . In the process he dispenses free legal advice to customers along with detergent and bleach . Also , the woman giving me this particular eye is not exactly a supermodel . She 's maybe four feet eleven inches tall , rather round , and wearing a coat so bulky she could be hiding a four-gallon jug of Tide under it . Her hair is stringy and most likely not squeaky clean to the touch . Truth be told , even if we were in a nightclub and the woman looked more like Halle than Boysen Berry , I doubt I could accurately gauge the situation . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no experience with women giving me the eye . In fact , though I 'm not in the habit of counting offered body parts , it 's safe to say that over the years I 've gotten the finger more than the eye . And I 've probably gotten the boot more than both of them combined . To totally close off any romantic possibilities in this encounter , I remain inlove with , and totally faithful to , one Laurie Collins . So no matter how this round stranger tries to tempt me , I 'm not about to engage in an early evening bout of tawdry Laundromat sex . I notice that the woman 's eyes start alternating between me and the door , though no one else is entering . And as I move in her general direction , she starts to inch toward that door . This woman is afraid of me . " Hi , " I say , figuring a clever opening like that will put her at ease . Instead , she just nods slightly and seems to draw inward , as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask . The woman mutters , " No ... I do n't know ... , " then gathers her clothes , which she had n't yet put into the machine , and quickly leaves . In the process she bangs into Kevin 's cousin Billy , who is just coming in . Billy runs the place when Kevin is not around . " Hey , Andy . What 's with her ? " Billy asks . " I 'm not sure . I think she was afraid she might succumb to my charms . " He nods . " We 've been getting a lot of that lately . " " What do you mean ? " Billy just points toward a shelf high up in the corner of the room , and for the first time I realize that there is a television up there . It 's turned to local news , though the sound is off . There was a day when that would have been a problem , but now all the stations have that annoying crawl along the bottom of the screen . The subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in Passaic , the third such murder in the last three weeks . The killer has chosen to communicate and taunt the police through Daniel Cummings , a reporter for a local newspaper , and in the process has created a media furor . The woman who just left is not alone in her fear ; the entire community seems gripped by it . " They making any progress ? " I ask , referring to the police . Billy shrugs . " They 're appealing to the guy to give himself up . " I nod . " That should do the trick . Where 's Kevin ? " " Doctor . " " Is he sick ? " I ask , though I know better . Kevin has as many admirable qualities as anyone I know , but he happens to be a total hypochondriac . Billy laughs . " Yeah . He thinks his tongue is swollen and turning black . Kept sticking it out for me to look at . " " Was it swollen ? " He shakes his head . " Nope . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell him that ? " I ask . " Nope . I told him he should get it checked out , that he might be getting ' fat black tongue ' disease . " He shrugs and explains , " I 'm a little short this month ; I needed the hours . " I nod ; the more time Kevin spends at the doctor , the more time Billy gets to work here . I hand an envelope to Billy ; it had come to the office for Kevin . " Give this to him , okay ? " " You making deliveries now ? " he asks . " I 'm on my way to the foundation . " Billy nods . " Listen , do me a favor ? When you see Kevin , tell him his tongue looks like a bowling ball . " " No problem . " ( Continues ... )
