Smart Mice , Burying Fake Boobs &; How to Fudge a Job Interview ESQUIRE 'S ANSWER FELLA believes that there are no stupid questions , just stupid people who do n't ask questions , fearing they 'll look stupid . So ask Answer Fella anything . If he does n't know the answer , he 'll find out who does or who has a guess that sounds right . Do mice actually get smarter over time ? The traps I 'm using no longer work . Mice are bright  --  sometimes brilliant : witness Steve Buscemi  --  and if their life span were much longer ( the average is a year in the wild , two to three years for a lab dweller ) , we might all be speaking Squeakish and fretting over our tail size . Because rodents ca n't read , however  --  and rarely opt for more than basic cable  --  their wisdom is limited to their life experience , which is often trapcentric . " Typically , " says Ron Harrison , an Orkin training director , " that experience would be negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snaps but does n't catch him , it 's very rare that he will go back . Go to another method . Maybe try a glue board . If the trap is n't working anymore , it may be because you 've handled it a lot . If you 're a smoker or you have cologne or perfume on your hands , sometimes that smell will transmit to the trap and be a discouraging factor to mice . " Harrison does not recommend cheese or any other food as mouse bait , preferring a " cotton ball with a little bit of water . That 's much more attractive than any food , because they 're so curious and interested in having material for their nest . If you want to impress your girlfriend and she has a mouse , go over with a snap trap and a cotton ball and in just seconds  --  usually  --  the mouse will be trying to get that . " In fact , that 's just how Harrison wooed his first wife , Minnie . I was railroaded out of my previous job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue in job interviews ? It has long been Answer Fella 's firm belief that the only thing worse than looking for a job is finding one . That said , Mr. Rumsfeld , the various experts consulted by AF 's team of crack researchers unanimously recommend that you : 1 . Spin it . " Say something that 's close to the truth about the situation but viewed through rose-colored glasses , " says Vicky Oliver , author of 301 Smart Answers to Tough Interview Questions , adding , " I would also quickly follow up with what you 've learned from the experience . " 2 . Move on . " As quickly as you can , " advises Neil Yeager , coauthor of Power Interviews , " shift the conversation to the job you 're applying for and why you think you would be a good fit . " 3 . Speak no evil . Caryl Krannich , coauthor of Job Interview Tips for People with Not-So-Hot Backgrounds and Only an Idiot Would Choose a Book Title That Long , stresses , " Do n't bad-mouth your former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tone of voice , the set of your jaw , or the look in your eye . " Sir ? AF has one more idea : Think Halliburton . What happens to breast implants after death ? If you unearthed Anna Nicole Smith in 50 years , would you find only a pair of silicone bags ? Assuming that Howard K. Stern does not wind up peddling Ms. Smith 's ersatz love sacs on eBay and that they remain inside her corpse  --  breast implants are sometimes removed prior to cremation ; rarely , if ever , otherwise  --  and that she is buried inside a sealed casket , it 's safe to say you 'd find those sad and lonely falsies fully intact centuries from now . " Silicone does n't really deteriorate , " says Dr. Kenneth V. Iserson , author of Death to Dust : What Happens to Dead Bodies ? and Naming Books Without Using Colons : A Guide . " The embalming fluid does n't do much to them , so they just sit there . " Depending on the humidity of the climate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burial chamber , you may well find bones , too . And a copy of J. Howard Marshall 's last will and testament . And a single pink silk rose , tossed into her coffin just before it was closed forever , by Wolf Blitzer . The Useful Part HOW TO WRITE AF AF cares deeply about every one of his non-Canadian readers and is especially grateful for the hundreds of questions he receives . But he is just one man , and even with the indispensable help of Christendom 's finest fact squad  --  since AF 's Arabic is rusty , he wo n't presume to judge the researchers at the Tora Bora Shopper 's " Ask al-Zawahiri " column  --  AF ca n't answer every query . Hence , a tip or three for landing your very own question in the pages of Esquire : 1 . AF regularly receives dozens of questions about toilets , toilet seats , defecation , urination , and bathroom etiquette . He wishes you would give it a rest . ( The same is true of all questions about dogs , body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions , questions about word origins are anathema ( from the Greek word meaning " thing devoted to evil " ) . 3 . Questions that include your Web site 's URL are n't likely to run , unless you are a lifestyle dominatrix . Got a question ? Send it to Answer Fella via esquire.com/talk . <p>
