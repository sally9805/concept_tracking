Earlier this month in New Orleans , after announcing $90 million in hurricane-recovery grants , George Bush and Bill Clinton sat down for their first joint print interview , with TIME 's Michael Duffy , who covered both Presidents when they were in office . The two men were in a good mood , referring and deferring to each other throughout the 30-minute session and recalling a joint adventure on the high seas . Here are some excerpts : <P> TIME Your partnership struck a chord with the American people this year . How come ? <P> BUSH Some people do n't expect that if you run against each other , you then could ever work together again or be friends . But in my case , it 's something that 's very easy . Bill 's gone out of his way to make me feel comfortable in this work together . On the plane to the tsunami region , he would n't take the bedroom on the Air Force plane . I said , " No , come on , you go in there , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , " he said . I guess he wanted to play cards all night . But nevertheless , that means something to me . I 'm older , and it was a very great courtesy . So the relationship is fun for me . And you have this feeling of doing something important , doing something bigger than ourselves . <P> CLINTON Americans like politics ; they like debate . They like us to air our differences , because they know we have got to have an honest debate to come to a good answer . But then they also think that debate ought to have limits to it . And I think they believe that for more than 20 years , we 've gotten into thinking that people we have disagreements with are people we have to despise or demonize . They think that in turn it has had a boomerang effect on our country . It 's kept us from solving a lot of problems and doing a lot of things we could have done otherwise . So I think people see George and me , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . " But like President Bush said , it 's fun for us . I always liked him , and it 's been really fun . I 've been honored to do it . <P> TIME What is the one thing you 've seen in the other man that perhaps you did n't expect to find ? <P> BUSH President Clinton has shown a certain deference to me based perhaps on me being the older guy . And I appreciate that . It 's something I 've seen firsthand many times , in very subtle ways , like today , walking in , " You go first . " That kind of stuff . We come from an old line , my family , kind of courteous kind of guys , and this means something to me . It 's not just social niceties . There are many ways he makes me feel that this is a two-way street and that he 's enjoying it . <P> There will be differences . He 's still active . He 's still a guy who 's going to be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and certain members of my family , but that can be handled . It does n't have to interfere or ruin our personal relationship . <P> CLINTON The interesting thing is his son is the President and my wife is a Senator  --  <P> BUSH Half-joking I 'd like to speak to you about that in the future . <P> CLINTON  --  and we made this work anyway . It 's been a joy . I even like the arguments we have . <P> TIME Like what ?
