Regarding this story , Mr. Jablokov says : Once , in an impoverished period , I owned a Subaru GLF that I had bought from a nonimpoverished friend who had abandoned it behind his house after it stopped working . It was an earnest car , a hard-working car , but its upbringing had resulted in many bad habits , among which was a need to visit the local repair shop every couple of months . Bob , of Uncle Russ 's , had one piece of advice , which he gave me whenever I brought the car in : " Sell the car . " Eventually I did , and then missed my visits . Uncle Russ 's is gone , replaced with a crisply efficient Valvoline , and so " Wrong Number " will have to stand as a belated Valentine to that vanished crew . <p> STEPHANIE FOUND HERSELF wide awake at 2:13 A.M. , remembering a phone number . Hers , but with one digit wrong . She could see the thing , rounded numbers on a cocktail napkin with a blue ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong on purpose . She had n't thought of that night since ... well , probably since it happened . She 'd been working on the campaign of a state rep , and had started talking with some guy vaguely associated with the rep 's auto leasing business at the low-key victory party . Decent-looking guy , nice jacket , with , as she remembered , an interest in collecting antique cars . Everyone was in a great mood . Then he began to seem creepy . Maybe it was the excessive emphasis on the size of the garage he kept his car collection in , or the way he made sure that she could see that the buttons on his jacket sleeve really buttoned , or the fact that along with the sleeve she also observed that he neither trimmed or cleaned his fingernails regularly . Whatever , she lost interest and decided to go home . Despite her watch checking and " now , where 's my coat ? " scan of the rack by the entrance , he did n't catch on , and asked for her phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He became insistent , in an oddly compelling way . She was there alone , and , at that moment , felt weak . After a moment 's hesitation , she wrote down a fake number , changing the fifth digit of the actual number . She 'd heard of obsessives working their way through all ten variants of a wrong last digit , but the fifth seemed safe . And it worked . The feared call never came , and she forgot about the incident . Until now . But it was more than a memory now , it was a compulsion . She could not stop thinking about it . Around four , she gave up on trying to get back to sleep , and watched a couple of old episodes of Law &; Order . It was like something on a camera lens , showing up in every picture . That number . That wrong number . It seemed like the worst thing she had ever done . Worse than the time she had called her seventh-grade friend Fran , who had a limp , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class queen bee , Mandy Beekman , to like her . Worse , even , than not calling her grandmother Eleanor in the last week before she died , even though it was clear that the kidneys had failed and that was it . When she 'd gotten the call from her mother on Monday morning , with the funeral date , she 'd implied without actually saying so that she 'd had a chat with Gran just a day or two before the end . Nothing really interesting , no great revelations , but it was really nice that she had managed to talk once more to Gran before it was too late ... and it was that , that implied - no , real - lie to her mother that stuck with her . " Quick update , " her friend Marlene said . " You 've been an incredible troll this past week . " There did n't seem to be a good reply to that , so Stephanie just looked at the dead spider plant that had been on the bookshelf in Marlene 's office for at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about the presentation ? " Marlene said . " Everyone knows Edith was way out of line on that . Not your fault , and who cares anyway ? Nobody even noticed . " " ' Everyone " has been paying a lot of attention to things " nobody " cares about . " Marlene tossed her blond hair . She 'd gotten a short cut last week , seemingly just so she could do that . " Okay , you 've uncovered the logical flaw in my argument . You 're still a troll . " " I need a drink . " " Brilliant suggestion . " The Cromlech was their high-end Friday after-work bar . None of their usual cronies had been able to make it that week , so Stephanie and Marlene were on their own . They picked seats near a mixed-sex group from some other workplace , away from bathrooms , drink pickup , and dart board , hoping to discourage drive-by sexual suggestions . As soon as the drinks arrived , Stephanie told Marlene about the phone number . " Is n't stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the salt . " Why do our minds have minds of their own ? " " But it 's not like some dumb pop song you ca n't forget . Somehow .... " " What ? " " More is hanging on it than that . " " Like what ? Futility ? Mortality ? Still no children ? Existential meaninglessness ? Drooping boobs ? " " They 're not drooping ! " " God did n't invent support garments , honey . Madame Olga did . Another reason to doubt . " " Do you ever regret having done something ? " Stephanie asked . " Sure . " Why did I get the maple walnut ? Would n't a scoop of the coffee have been a better choice ? I do n't even like maple , or walnut . What made me think the combination would be better ? ' " " You know what I mean ! " Marlene examined her . " Okay , I guess I do . Do you think this guy could have been important to you ? Like in a house-and-kids kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't . He was just a nice-looking guy who turned out to be not so nice . " " Millions of those . " " Exactly . So why am I obsessing about this one ? " Marlene did not have a quick answer to that , so Stephanie sipped her own drink . Once she tasted the bite of the tequila under the lime juice and Cointreau , she could n't stop . The Cromlech did not use a flavored corn syrup mix , but delivered something a grownup could drink . She drank steadily until there was nothing but a couple of bits of lime membrane at the bottom of the glass . The bartender , noticing her single-mindedness , had another ready even before she raised her finger . " Whoa , " Marlene said . " You better watch that . Best way to make sure you make decisions that lead to another such pointless discussion some time in the future . " " Oh , for heaven 's sake ! " Stephanie suddenly found Marlene 's hipyet-wise attitude intolerable . The second drink tasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it slowly , but failed . " Let me tell you a story . " Marlene , who never had a second drink , and was n't even finished with the first one , ordered another one as well . " Junior year of college I got involved with this guy . Archaeologist . Not my usual line , you understand . You know I like " em big and stupid . I 'll accept complexity in a Cabernet , but never in a man . " seeing Stephanie 's impatience , she hurried on . " I guess maybe we all go through our outdoorsy phase , just like we all once liked horses , even if it was just My Little Pony . Spencer had that tang of wood smoke . Specialized in Anasazi stuff , out in the Southwest . Got to go to a lot of pretty places . " Anyway , he was going away for a semester , to a dig in southern Utah . He wanted me to go with him . I did n't know we 'd gotten that serious . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind , like getting through school , and was n't interested in spending four months in a tent somewhere out in the desert , watching him clean dust off some potsherd with a camel's-hair brush . " It became kind of a big thing , and we had a fight , and he left . He published a few papers about his excavation , I think . My next semester did n't go well . Bad relationship , too much partying , failed a couple of classes . Everything kind of turned to crap , in other words . And I started to think about Spencer , about the clean dry desert , about the wind , about the clear blue sky , and the canyon walls , and the mysterious ruins , and realized how badly I had screwed up . I searched for him and found him , already junior faculty at San Francisco State . I planned a trip up there , thought I might surprise him , see if , at least , we could have dinner , and think about maybe fixing up what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember that . I had a bunch of clothes in stacks on the bed , and I reached in the back of the closet and pulled out a bag I had n't used in a long time . I 'd forgotten I even had it . It was the perfect size for an overnight bag . I opened it up . Inside was a photograph . It was of me and Spencer at some stupid party , our arms linked , holding drinks , smiling at the camera . Well , he was smiling . My head was gone . Someone-Spencer - had cut it out with scissors , and replaced it with a dog 's head . " Stephanie found herself resisting asking what breed of dog . " He called you a bitch ? " " Stephanie , he cut my head off ! " " You must have been devastated . " " I was furious ! But relieved . I do n't know if I 'd ever really believed something would be different if I could see him again , and go sit in the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this corked it . But how gracious of him , I realized later , to have made it so clear that that hope was ridiculous , and that I 'd made the right choice in the first place . That none of it was my fault . Like salespeople who get nasty with you when you give their product a pass . Kind of lets you off the hook . " " But this is different , Marlene . This is something I 'm doing to myself . " " Do n't be so sure , girlfriend . " Stephanie stopped herself from ordering another drink , but only by finishing Marlene 's second , virtually untouched one . " What do you mean ? " " You free tomorrow ? " Marlene said . " I need to get some body work done on my car . " " I did n't notice anything wrong with your car . " They 'd driven over in it . " I guarantee you 'll see it tomorrow . " " This looks really recent . " The mechanic , a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marlene 's shattered right taillight . Stephanie wondered what the mechanic would say if she told him that Marlene had , in fact , backed deliberately into a Dumpster just that morning , after picking Stephanie up . " You know I do n't like letting things like that go , Jason . " Marlene was blithe . " No , I do n't know that . " " Does it tell you anything ? " " It tells me you could work on your driving . " " Really . " Marlene arched her back . " Is that all ? " Not having an answer , Jason scratched his head with scarred knuckles . Every once in a while , Marlene got a yen for " someone who works with his hands . " The relationships with plumbers , carpenters , and deli counter employees had never worked out well , and the wiring some horny but unlicensed electrician had installed in her bedroom had once set off the smoke alarms in her apartment during a dinner party . The fire crew had taken off with all the carpaccio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirtiness with the somber mechanic that showed the situation was more complicated than the usual predatory approach . While the two of them tested their anxieties on each other , Stephanie took a turn around the dark repair shop . Light had pretty much given up struggling through the wire mesh safety glass of the windows . The tarp-shrouded cars seemed to have been there for generations . Two guys way past retirement age , pointed out by Marlene as Cliff and Gordon , slowly hand polished the one alive-looking car in the place , a blue Alfa Romeo Spider , a sweet little convertible . One man had started out white , the other black , but both were now a general sort of grease-covered gray . " You missed a spot . " " That 's on your side , brother . " " I do n't have a side . I 'm kind of like overseeing this operation . " " Since when ? " " Since you missed putting fresh tissues in the glove box . They got ta be fresh , every week . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason and Marlene . " Think he 'll ever get tired of this ? " Cliff microscopically adjusted the Alfa Romeo 's rearview mirror . " And move on ? Who can say ? " " Hey , is n't that kind of your job around here ? Predicting things ? " " Sure . " Gordon put some more polish on his cloth . " I can predict that you better be nice to me , because you 'll never get another job , flapping that chamois the way you do . " Stephanie walked back around , past the partition that separated the office from the shop . She wondered if they had a refrigerator in there . She could do with something cold to drink . That damn wrong phone number . She was still thinking about it . If Marlene had brought her here to distract her , it was n't working . " I think you 'd better go somewhere else , " Jason was saying . " I do n't think I can handle this . " " It 's just a taillight ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taillights ? " " You know how I work . You know what I do . Please do n't treat it casually . " Stephanie felt something cold on her knuckles and jumped . " Sorry . " It was Cliff , the old white guy , with a Diet Coke . He had hair on his ears , and white hair straggling out from under a PawSox cap . " Did you want regular ? " " No , this is fine , thanks . " " Hey , Jason ! " Gordon , the old black guy , lumbered by with a tailpipe on his shoulder . " Help this lady out . You need to actually fix something that will stay fixed . " Jason and Marlene stopped their discussion and looked at Stephanie , Jason pouty-lipped in an oddly aristocratic way , Marlene nearer tears than she usually allowed herself to get . The world seemed full of nothing but romantic disappointment . " Where are you going with that ? " Cliff looked at Gordon . " It 's got to go in the back there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're making a mess . " " I am not ! " Jason came quietly into the office , sat at the battered steel desk . " You have a problem , then . " " My car is fine . " " Not with your car . " So , just like that , Stephanie found herself sitting down and telling an absolute stranger about the guilt she felt about having given some guy an incorrect phone number . And she did n't even feel like an idiot doing it . " What else do you remember ? " Now that he 'd made his decision , Jason was intent and clinical . " Not about the evening as a whole . Just about writing down the number . About him , about that man . Close your eyes . Let the image come up . Then think about your peripheral vision . It 's not as sharp , but sometimes it 's surprising what it will catch . " Obediently , Stephanie closed her eyes . She 'd been trying desperately not to think about that night , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seem like a really unpleasant job , a place you thought about all the time , even when you were n't there , so that it colonized all your available soul , and ruined your Sundays . Scribbles on a paper cocktail napkin decorated with a blue ship 's wheel . A bit of table , a paper plate with a smear of frosting . A man 's hand .... " I see his cufflink . " " Can you draw it for me ? " " I do n't draw very well . " " It 's not a contest . Nothing off a matchbook cover . I just need something to go on . " He rummaged around on the office 's Steelcase desk , searching for a piece of paper that was not already covered with scribbles , and finally came up with an empty paper bag only slightly stained with grease . He smoothed it out and handed Stephanie a ballpoint . To her surprise , the image that appeared under her hand was a clear and accurate rendering of the oblong crystal of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception room 's chandelier , which she had not consciously noticed . Maybe somewhere in those swirls was her own trapped face . " Wow , " she said . " I ca n't even draw things right in front of me this well . " " It 's a symptom . It confirms my suspicions . Do n't worry . The symptom is serious , but the cause is curable . Cliffie ! " " What , boss ? " " Can you make me one of these ? " Cliff squinted at the drawing on the white paper bag . " With what ? We do n't got a lot of cubic zirconium around here , unless you 've been getting shipments I have n't been inventorying . " " Just do the best you can with what we got on hand . There 's the rearview that broke . It 's in the trash , but you can get something off of it . " " Great . I love wiping mayo and jelly donut off broken glass . " Jason just looked at him and Cliff eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd taken a square of the mirrorbacked glass and glued it to a hose clamp . It did n't look that much like the cufflink , but Jason seemed happy with it . " Here 's what I want you to do , " he said . " I 'm going to give you a tube of polymer adhesive . When you get home , take the cap off your crankcase , the one the oil goes in . Glue this to the underside of the cap . Let it harden , should n't take more than a couple of minutes , then put the cap back on . Make sure it 's glued on tight , or it will fall off and screw up your entire engine . " Stephanie waited a couple of seconds , waiting for some explanation that made sense , but it did not seem that one was forthcoming . " What does this get me ? " she said . " It gets you in an accident . And that gets you back here . Where I can do what I do : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's sake just listen to him , Stephanie . " Marlene was sparkly . She 'd arranged something , gotten everyone interested . That was what she liked . " What will it run me ? " Stephanie ignored Marlene 's gasp at the crude question . " Nothing in cash . " Jason really was a most attractive man , Stephanie thought now . He listened hard when you talked , and his eyes were a nice and unusual dark blue . Clean him up , dress him up , and cheer him up , and he 'd be great to be out with somewhere . " But , there will be something .. . a piece of information , a connection . I do n't know what yet . That 's what I work for . " But it was no doubt that air of great and secret tragedy that Marlene had really bought into . " I think I can deal with that , " Stephanie said . What happened to test patterns ? There was a time when people went to bed but ponderous electron-spitting tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stephanie 's dad had many dates for when civilization had passed the knee in the downward curve , and the end of the test pattern was one of them . " Its disappearance marked the end of the era when the TV itself would tell you that you were wasting your time , " he said . " Though no test pattern I ever saw said explicitly " you 're a miserable loser . ' " Miserable insomniac loser . Thanks , Dad . So , instead of a test pattern , Stephanie found herself at three in the morning watching a rerun of a TV movie about ... what was it about ? A once-famous murder-or-maybe-not in a wealthy suburb . The TV movie came down in favor of murder by the entitled wealthy husband . Stephanie had once wondered who in the world watched TV movies . Now she knew : terminally depressed people . A bigger market than she might have anticipated , it looked like . Hell of a target demographic . According to Marlene , she 'd met Jason when she came in to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuring out a way to leave her old job without half a year of misery and poor performance : her usual MO . " And you think he had something to do with that ? " Stephanie was incredulous . " Well , yes . He makes connections . That 's just kind of the way he works . Just relax . It will work out for you . " Stephanie thought about some of the things Jason had said . " What did it cost you ? " " Cost ? " " He said that solving that kind of problem does n't cost anything . Not in cash . But in - " " Oh . Well , it was a little odd . I will say that . " " What ? " Stephanie was suddenly apprehensive . " What did he want ? " " Nothing gross or intrusive . The name of my imaginary childhood playmate . And the last time I had played with him . " " Him ? " " Sure . Besides my two sisters , all my friends were girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until that day when I saw a Batman comic at school . One of the boys had it . I lost my heart to that dark knight .... " " And Carlo got dumped . " " Like a sack of concrete . So that was what I gave to Jason . An out-of-date imaginary playmate . Not too scary , right ? " " Um , no . Probably not . But weird . " " Unusual maybe . " Marlene was oddly insistent . " Not weird . Maybe life would be easier if I went for guys like Jason . You know , the non-lummox type . But it does n't really do anything for me . Plus .. . oh , jeez , this is going to sound really dumb . Jason 's looking for someone . A woman . Someone he was once hooked up with . They broke up .. . she ran away .. . it all sounds wretched and melodramatic andbook-groupish .. . anyway , he 's still hooked on her , wherever she is . " " I 'll let him work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer whatever question he has . " " It will be great . He 's really got some ... magic . " As she remembered that afternoon 's conversation , Stephanie reached over the side of the bed and grabbed at the pint of Karamel Sutra . The thing was empty . She scraped at what was left on the lid , then threw herself back on the bed . Ouch . She reached behind her and pulled out an InStyle and a Vogue , each the size of an organic chemistry text . She 'd read and dogeared them both . That spa in Costa Rica looked great ... maybe she could sell everything she owned and go there . Or maybe the nice patterned stockings from Saks would be a more reasonable choice . She 'd gone to sleep just fine , but had again woken with a jerk at a little after two A.M. The husband and the husband 's blow-up doll mistress were setting up a perfect murder in the bedroom only ... oh , the girlfriend was supposed to be innocent , a dupe . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was whose now-remaindered memoir the movie was based on . Well , if she was n't going to get back to sleep , and was n't going to enjoy anything tawdry , she was going to get another pint of ice cream at White Hen Pantry . By God . She pulled out of the apartment complex parking lot The car came around the corner with a screech . A big powerful sedan from some other era , wide , flat , and edged , rather than overinflated like modern SUVs . It was some pale color , and flashed across her field of view like a lightning bolt . Stephanie swerved toward the curb , but it was too late . The sedan sideswiped her , making her car rock up onto one pair of wheels , and then was gone , not even slowing down . She stared in shock after its red taillights , then whimpered . Even a brief moment of thinking she was going to die had n't gotten her mind off that telephone number . What was she going to do ? The driver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had to climb across the gear shift and out the other door . The car was a mess , scraped and pushed in all the way from the front of the rear quarter panel to the headlight which , miraculously , still worked . Then she remembered . Her little afternoon task . Epoxy , a mockup cufflink , an oil cap . She did n't know any more about what was happening to her , but now , at least , she was good and mad . Thunder rumbled overhead . She 'd never had an imaginary friend , male or female . So there was no way Jason was ever going to get that from her . THE SHOP ENTRANCE came up more quickly than Stephanie expected . She skidded on the wet pavement as she made the turn , and was satisfied to see Jason leap out of the way as she slewed into the bay . She let the water flick off her windshield wipers for a moment before turning off the car . They froze halfway down . She wrestled with the dented door for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger side . She was so mad she banged her head on the top of the door as she jumped out . Jason stood right there , a printed diagram of a car hanging from his hand . Parts of the car were circled and marked with red pen . Looked like an insurance company was about to be charged for some hefty repairs . " You bastard , " she said . " You set that up . " A pause when he did n't say anything . " How ? " " ' How " is just technique . " Jason was calm . Cliff and Gordon sat in the near background , placidly playing cards despite the fact that it was still only midmorning , while a radio played some endlessly rotated " 60s song whose name Stephanie had never learned , and that the two old men must have heard for the first time when they were already adults , married with children . Water dripped through the leaky roof and into a line of mismatched buckets . " I could go into how , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wet side of her car , and it stuck . Water seeped through the thin paper . As she watched the ink blossom , she realized that it was a diagram of her car . It showed the damage she had just brought in . What had she gotten herself into ? Marlene 's answering machine message had cheerily noted the day 's wet weather , so she had n't disappeared or died or anything . Stephanie had yelled her message , in case Marlene was in the shower , but there had been no answer , and the machine had eventually cut her off . " Distracting ? I could have been killed . " " Not likely . " Jason was dreamy , and a bit sullen . " Not likely at all . " She wished she 'd clipped him coming in , but had to be satisfied with the line of wetness her wiper had thrown onto his coverall . " Did you think I understood what I was agreeing to ? That I was signing up to have a car smash into me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's ridiculous . Do I seem like someone who understands the workings of whatever ... magic you play at here ? Like someone who can give informed consent to whatever nutty contagion or psychic inertia or whatever the hell is your stock in trade ? " " She 's got you there , Jason , " Cliff said . " Yeah . " Gordon got up , dug around in a locker and came up with an incongruously fluffy white towel . He draped it over his shoulder . " Hard to keep up the rent and maintenance on the kind of metaphysical freight you charge . Just does n't translate into , like , bill-paying stuff . " " Maybe if you charged in cash ... , " Cliff said . " This is the best job I 've ever had . " Gordon put a couple of cards down . " Do n't want to lose it . " " Do you work here ? " Cliff , clearly losing , picked Gordon 's discards up . " I 'm sorry , " Jason said to Stephanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty strong curse . " " Curse ? " She felt like someone had just kicked her in the stomach . " There are more technical terms , but yes , of course . Curse . You angered someone . Someone who had either developed or acquired the power to do you harm by influencing nonphysical states . So he cursed you . " " Your job is uncovering curses ? " " No ! " He stepped past Stephanie and knelt by her car , looking carefully at its scraped side . " I 'd like nothing better than to just fix cars . That 's what I did , for a long time . Fix cars . But , sometimes things would unfix , stop working in ways I could not explain . I realized that I had not adequately defined the boundaries of the problem . Nine tenths of solving any problem is knowing what the boundaries are . Keep that in mind . Your man drives a yellow car . " " Yellow - " She had n't really seen it , but now the flash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know ? " He gestured , and she knelt down and looked , even though it was painful to see what had happened to her car . The metal was buckled and scraped . But , yes , there , deep in the scratches : streaks of gold in the bare metal . Beyond that , the dark blue of buckled paint , so they seemed a gleam of sunlight darting , at the last possible moment of evening , through the clouds that had hovered in the sky the entire day . That color made it real . A real car had hit her . Driven by - ? " You made him hit me , " she said . Jason shook his head . " He 'd already hit you . I 've just processed the damage so that it 's a little easier to see . And thus to understand . " He frowned and looked more closely at the paint . " Jesus ! " Marlene strode into the shop from the rain outside . " What 's up with this weather ? " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain , and it looked like she 'd walked for quite some way . Mud had spattered up her calves and caked on the high-heeled sandals that curved their straps around her calves . She wore a bright red dress that looked like it was made out of rubber . Stephanie had run out of the house in dress appropriate for a spring cold snap , in a Fair Isle sweater and wool skirt . Gordon handed Marlene the towel . " You 're dressed like Polly Pocket , " Stephanie said . Marlene toweled her hair . " You 're dressed like my mother . " " Ouch . " Jason quietly stood up from his examination of the dent , grabbed a Makita drill , and slid a wire brush wheel onto it . Everyone watched him put on goggles , step back to the car , spin up the drill , and lower it to the scraped quarter panel . " Jason ! " Gordon stepped forward . " That 's the evidence there . The only connection to the accident you 're trying to repair . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cliff was equally agitated . " That 's just not good business . " Jason jerked back , almost scraping his nose with the wire wheel . " None of your business , gentlemen . Get back to whatever you were doing . " " Jason . " Marlene raised a hand , but , seeing the expression on his face , did not touch Jason 's arm . The drill whined to a halt as his finger ceased to press on the trigger . " What 's wrong ? What do you see there ? " " What did that man look like ? " Jason spoke to Stephanie . " The one who cursed you . " " I said as much as I remember . I was n't paying attention at that point . But I 'm still thinking about the telephone number . " " The telephone number .... " Jason looked stunned , as if hearing all of it for the first time . " Old cars ... cuff link .... Did he ... his fingernails .... " " Terrible , " Stephanie said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed by how nice you keep your hands , Jason . Given what you do for a living . " Jason ignored Stephanie 's feeble compliment and looked at Marlene , who stepped back , startled by the intensity of his gaze . " When we met , I was looking for someone . A woman who - " " You 're still looking for her , right ? I mean , you have n't told me anything different . " Marlene 's cheerful mood had vanished . " That 's true . " " So I did n't add in any hope . It 's still the same amount . " Jason closed his eyes . " I 'm sorry . " Gordon leaned over Stephanie 's car , ran a finger down the streak of yellow . " That 's it . The track . We got him , Cliffie . We got him . The guy she ran off with . Right here . " He rubbed his bald head with a large-knuckled hand . " Amazing , " Cliff said . " Great thing about guys like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them again . " Gordon grabbed a box from the desk and handed Stephanie a tissue . A few seconds later , she turned and sneezed . " Does anyone seem particularly happy about that , do you think ? " Gordon shrugged . " Jason 's been looking for this guy for a long time . He thinks finding him will solve his problems , get his girl back , all kinds of stuff . Even smart people do n't understand anything . Only way the rest of us can get by in this world , I always say . " " That trace on my car is going to let him find his old girlfriend ? " " He thinks so . And he seems to know his business . " " Buff it out . " Stephanie 's voice came out harsher than she expected , almost a bark of command . Gordon and Cliff jumped . " What ? " " Clean out the paint . Then you can pull the dent , put in some Bondo , do your thing , right ? Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't listen to her . " Marlene was just as peremptory . " Jason . Do what you do . " " Do you ... do you mean that ? " " Was this girl someone who would say things she did n't mean ? " Marlene shook her head slowly . " That gives me some hope , then , because I always mean what I say . Find her , Jason . Find her , however you do that . We 'd have to deal with her eventually anyway . Right ? Then we 'll see . " " This was just coincidence , you know . I was n't looking for her when I decided to help Stephanie .... " " Keep denying things and I 'll start to think there 's something worth denying . " Without another word , Jason went into his office . " Marlene .... " Stephanie was irritated with Jason for agreeing so easily , even though she could see that he would have had to eventually . " Gordo , " Marlene said . " Got any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what looked like a set of jeweler 's tools : picks , scrapers , swabs . This time , when he removed the yellow streak from the side of the car , no one tried to stop him . " I usually have more paint to go on for a match than this . " Jason looked at a small glass vial . Clear solvent filled most of it , but a thin layer of yellow floated at the top . " This is really police lab stuff . Fortunately yellow 's a pretty straightforward color . Blues shift into green , reds into orange , with oxidation and light . Makes trying to figure out what color it was when it rolled off the line almost impossible . Yellow 's pretty stable and has a nice single pigment , so there are no ratios to worry about . " He cleared some space on the desk and turned on a bright white light . He pulled a peacock-tail Pantone color chip book out of a locked drawer , fanned it out , and held paint swatches against the tube . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Stephanie asked . Jason snorted . " Auto makers do n't make their own paint . It 's a huge web of contractors and subcontractors . Those polymers , resins , metal flakes , desiccants , pigments ... I wo n't call it a craft industry , but it still is way more fragmented than most things are nowadays . No way I can tell the make of car from that . And , you know what ? The exact color does n't really matter to me here . This is really more habit than anything else . But I do have the actual pigment with me here - given your description of the accident , probably from the front right portion of this car . There are resonance linkages , aesthetic to retinal . Pretty technical stuff , not usually of interest to clients . " He sighed . " The worst part of my job , color . Bumper gets painted at the same time as the car , and , you know what ? It comes out different , right off the line : temperature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bumper paint . Clients always remember the bumper being the same color as the car . No one ever really looks at their car , except when it comes out of the body shop . Then it 's " Why does n't it match ? " " It never matched " just is n't an answer they 're ever going to hear . " He shook his head in despair at his doomed position , trying to satisfy the childish needs of emotionally vulnerable people who 'd had car accidents . He looked so comfortable with his color chips and pigment matching . It was a pity to have to rile him up again . " Did you lose her through a curse ? " Stephanie said . He froze for a second , then folded up his Pantone book , cleared off his desk , and stood up . " Yes . He ... took her . That was how I got started , on all this . Her car . " He pointed at the Alfa Romeo Spider . " It was smashed flat , under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't dead . The guy with the car collection . I think he collected her too . " " Did you think repairing that car would help you find her ? " " It did . It taught me a lot . But it was only the first step on a long road . " " A road you 're getting to the end of . " Stephanie could n't believe that the solution to her problem was going to hurt her friend . But Marlene had already offered to back away once . Any more , and Marlene would get annoyed . No new information had surfaced , so there was no reason for her to reconsider her decision . That was the way Marlene worked things . " Maybe . We 'll see . " Jason sighed . " The price .... " Stephanie felt a chill . " Yes ? What will you need from me ? I never had an imaginary friend . " " You and Marlene talk a lot . " " Is that bad ? Was she not supposed to have told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Just ... when you talk to her , tell her that ... this does n't make me happy . " " Come on ; Jason . You really want to use me as some kind of back channel to give her some idiotic nonsense like that ? It does n't matter if it was accidental , or coincidental , or what , but you 're going to hurt her because of what she brought in here for you . Because of me . You can stop . Just fix my car like a normal body shop would . I 'll deal with the damn number . I 've almost forgotten it . " " Now who 's giving nonsense ? You 're a good friend , Stephanie . But Marlene 's right . If I do n't do it , if I leave it hanging , I wo n't be doing anyone any favors . Plus , I want to give that arrogant s.o.b . one in the eye . " His voice was suddenly fierce . " Do n't you ? " " What will you want from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone number . The wrong one ? " " Yes . If this all works , it will be wiped from your mind . When it goes , I want it . " Stephanie took a breath . Was it valuable in some way ? Was she giving up something crucial ? " Okay . It 's a deal . " They shook hands , and looked over at where Marlene stood by Cliff and Gordon as they played an old board game of Panzer warfare , an endless expanse of hexagons representing the entire Eastern Front . The two old men , one bald , one hairy-eared , fiddled with stacks of cardboard squares . Gordon was Stalin , Cliffie Hitler . " Guderian , " Cliff looked at Stephanie . " I 'm Guderian , for God 's sake . " " What ? " Stephanie said . " Are n't you going south along the Dnieper ? " Marlene asked him . " Think of all that grain ! " " Excuse me , missy , but could you please stay out of it ? " Marlene looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regretted letting things go ahead , she gave no sign of it . Jason reached into a dark corner and pulled out a big chunk of Styrofoam that had once cradled a computer or piece of audio equipment . He grabbed a screwdriver off a shelf - every level surface seemed to have at least two or three tools on it - and dug a small round hole in it , just the right size to hold the vial firmly . On the other side of the shop , he shoved the Styrofoam in one of the holders on a four-unit paint shaker that usually handled gallon cans . He tugged and readjusted until he was satisfied that it would hold . The shake started loud and got louder , until Stephanie was sure it would shake itself into pieces , somehow unbalanced by having only one tiny container with a few fluid ounces in it . The vial blurred into a line , and the streak of yellow seemed to get brighter , as if glowing . Then the line - that shaker really was out of adjustment - shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old sci-fi movie : an oval , an hourglass , a ridged thing , then a dancing wiggling thing that froze , for an instant , into a jagged ideogram , which then vanished . " Cliffie ? " Jason looked up at a car that had just pulled into the far bay . " Could you take care of that guy ? He 's here for an inspection . Overdue , looks like . Give him whatever help he wants . " " Hey , I was just about to capture Moscow ! Okay , okay . " Cliff got up and limped over to the yellow 1965 Pontiac Bonneville . " What do you know , the car that owned the " 60s ! And , boy , do we have some legacy emissions standards for you . " It was the car that had hit her . She could see the way the right headlight tilted away , shining on the Spider 's gleaming blue fender . But she could n't see anyone behind the black windshield . She started for it . " You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . " Neither of us is . Not yet . Please . " " What do I get if I resist bashing his head in with a tire iron ? " " Release from the curse . Otherwise - " " I 'll be stuck with it ? " " Let 's just say it would n't be under warranty . Here , put this on . " He handed her a coverall . " It 'll keep your clothes clean . Please excuse the name . It 's our designated newbie coverall . " Above the right breast pocket on the stiff , oil-stained blue coveralls was an embroidered " Fartley . " Stephanie paused , then shrugged and put it on . " Who 's your newbie ? " " Cliffie . Well , he 's been here eight years now and he 's kind of not liking that coverall anymore . So we use it for guests . " Cliff had set up the headlight alignment test . " This guy should fail , Jason . Look at - " " I know . We 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't anything Stephanie had to do with . That was Jason 's game . But it had all come together . Her need had played into what Jason needed . How much of that , she wondered , was accidental , and how much was planned ? " Hey , Cliffie ! " Marlene yelled . " I 've been playing your pieces for you , while you 're busy . I just seized the Caucasus oil fields . " " That was n't my strategy , girl ! I was going for the urban areas . " " Show a little gratitude . That 's all I ask . " " Ca n't you let him lose on his own ? " Gordon hunched , trying to figure a way to escape the complete collapse of his strategy . That was Marlene : a smart babe in a rubber dress with a genuine talent for mechanized warfare . " Here 's what I need for you to do . " Jason handed her a clean blue wipe rag from the dispenser . " As I adjust the light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My actual number ? " " Your actual number . I 'll take it from there . " He knelt by the Bonneville and adjusted the headlight with a screwdriver . The misaligned headlamp beam left the Spider and crept toward the orientation cross on the wall . Stephanie grabbed a ballpoint and scribbled her phone number on the rag . As she got to the next to last digit , she hesitated . What was ... she could n't believe she was having trouble remembering her own phone number . But ... was it ... Jesus , of course , this was ridiculous . She managed to get the correct digit down , then finished . As she did , the headlight hit the cross , and she could see . There , in the light , was that room , the room where she had met him , and given him the bad number . It had only been ... Jesus , six years ago ? But already it looked like history . The clothes had funny proportions , the celebrities discussed no longer interesting , the cell phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't look horrifying . A bit self-satisfied , maybe . And then there were those fingernails .... He watched her intently as she wrote down the phone number . He was n't used to being balked . He would get back at anyone who did . God , that bastard , putting that delayed-reaction booby trap into her temporary weakness . Sure , she should just have stood up to him and told him there was no way on Earth he was ever getting her telephone number . She 'd tried , but he had n't let it go . Stephanie stepped forward into the scene , plucked the cocktail napkin off the table , and replaced it , neatly , with the completely out of context blue wipe cloth from the body shop . Let someone else worry about how little sense that made . The headlights went off . Stephanie stumbled forward in the sudden darkness . Her foot slipped on a patch of grease and she was falling A hand caught her under the armpit and hauled her up . Once she was steady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for moving so quickly It was the driver of the Bonneville . The guy with the number . The man who had cursed her . He stared at her . " Who the hell are you ? " " Who ? " Stephanie was outraged . " You do n't remember ? Six years ago ? I gave you my phone number , but I ... changed it ? " " No , I do n't remember . But I guess you deserved whatever I gave you . " He started to smirk , but his expression turned to one of pain . He stared at her . He sucked in a breath . Then he started to cry . She caught a glimpse of the vision he was having . A vision , she thought later , of their collision , the one she had avoided . She had given him the right number . He had called it . They had gone out . Then ... a haze of possible courses as a relationship that should n't have happened limped to its death . Grim meals pressed flat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The final savage indifference of a relationship gone zombie . " Now , " she said . " Are n't you glad you never got that number ? " " That never could have .... " He was gasping for breath . " Did that happen ? " " No way . Because I 'm smarter than that . " She noticed that a sleeve of his shirt was flopping loose . " I have something for you . " He wiped his nose with his sleeve . As she popped the hood of her car she noticed , without surprise , that the damage had been repaired . The side of her car was gleaming , perfect . She unscrewed the oil cap and there it was : a cufflink . Not a piece of shattered mirror on a hose clamp , but a real cufflink , beautiful and elegant . She wiped the oil off with a rag and handed it to him . He stared at it in wonder . " What ... ? " " You must have dropped it . That night , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist around it . " It 's that stupid .... " He raised his voice . " Hey , Jason ! You out there , buddy ? This is what it 's all about , eh ? " " No , " Stephanie said . " This is about what you did to me . That 's it . " " Oh , sure . That moron . He 's just playing around . You were in trouble . He helped you out . Aw . " He made a mock sympathetic face that made her want to hit him . " Next time do n't play so hard to get . " " Pay the cashier on the way out , " Jason said from the darkness . " Go ahead . Use the number . Call her . Then you 'll learn what you never wanted to know . " The guy laughed . " Hey , " Stephanie said . " Can I tell you something ? " " Yeah , sure , go ahead . I 'm sure you can set me straight on everything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when people disappoint you , just be kind . " " That 's it ? " " You 'll meet someone , someday . " " Screw you . " He got into his car and pulled out of the shop . " Jeez , " Marlene said . " What a sorehead . " Marlene finished up her chess game with Gordon , while Cliffie kibitzed and Jason sat on a high stool in the corner by the welding gear , talked on the phone , and cried . " Hey , that rook 's pinned , " Cliff said . " Do n't count on that to save your sorry old butt . " " Dammit , I can see that , ca n't I ? Just shut up . " " And look out for that knight - " " What did I just say ? " " It 's here , " Jason said through his tears . " Your car looks great . Perfect , just like before . You can just ... yes . That 's all . Just come get it . " Marlene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Check . " " Hey , man , " Cliff said . " Look , a revealed check from that rook back down there . I 'd forgotten about it . " " Great , thanks for pointing that out . After it already happened . " " Oh , you want me to predict the future ? " " Predicting the past is n't as helpful . " " Okay . Here 's your future : mate in two , buddy . " " What ? " Gordon stared at the board . " Ah , hell . " He toppled his king , which rolled off the board , to be neatly caught by Cliff 's foot , flipped into the air , and caught by Gordon , who set it back up . " Thanks for a good game . " " Thank you guys for a great afternoon . " Marlene beamed . The two old guys exchanged a glance . " Well , you know ... , " Cliff said . " Once you 've had old , you 'll be sold ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two guys quit way before Marlene . THE RAIN had stopped , but black clouds still covered the sky . Then a clear flash of sunlight came from behind , to illuminate the houses and trees on the other side of the street . The yellow light made them both vivid and flat . Everything glistened . " I like a man who can cry , " Marlene said . " Depends on what he 's crying about . " Stephanie started the car . It was perfect , like nothing had ever happened to it . And she could n't even remember the false phone number , the one that Jason had reused to contact his vanished girlfriend . " Me . He has to be crying about me . " " Or his mom . " " Okay . His mom . But not the Red Sox . " " Or his stock options . " " Right . " Marlene rubbed her nose . " That 's not sensitive . That 's just dumb . " " You okay , Marlene ? " " Been better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You 're all goosey-pimply . We 've got to get you out of this wet wind and into a dry martini . " " Green apple . There 's a good place over in Davis Square . " " Do you have any idea of what 's in one of those things , Marlene ? " Marlene stuck out her lower lip . " You never take me seriously . " " Oh , I certainly do . " They stopped at the corner . Behind them , they heard the garage door rumble up . A blue Alfa Romeo Spider pulled out . It accelerated down the street , then screeched to a halt at the stop sign . The stocky , strong-jawed woman driving it was pretty , but was n't an obvious candidate for romantic obsession . She turned and looked at Stephanie and Marlene . " The throw 's off on this shifter , " she said . " He did his best , but sometimes you ca n't get things back exactly the way they were . " She squeezed her eyes shut for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Someone honked behind her . She did n't look back , but just waved her hand in a vague gesture , jangling her bracelets . After another blast on the horn , the other car pulled around . It was a yellow Bonneville . It tore past , and , ignoring the stop sign , turned into traffic , causing a few honks of its own . None of them watched to see it disappear . " Well , " Stephanie said . " At least you 're free now . " The woman turned to look at her . " He caught me through my weakness . How did you escape ? " " I would n't have talked to him in the first place , " Stephanie said . " But I was trapped behind the pastry table . " " Do n't you have weaknesses ? " Stephanie surprised herself by laughing . " Oh , I have weaknesses , believe me . But ... I also have friends . " The woman did n't say anything else . Off throw or not , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disturbance . " So , Marlene , " Stephanie said . " Is it time to get back there ? " Marlene looked at the garage as its door finally came back down . " Not just yet . It would look a little ... desperate , do n't you think ? Unattractive trait , desperation . " " No one likes being pulled under by a drowning person . " " Jeez , Stephanie , how charming . " " I was just agreeing with you . Let him wait a couple of days . " " You know , he learned this business , how to do it , looking for her . That was what got him started . So , finally , he found her . Now he 's got a nice little career going . I hope he sticks with it . " " He sure enough saved me . " " No number ? " " My brain is totally clear . So transparent I could go into modeling . " Marlene snorted . " You want mental transparence ? Did I ever tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you liked men who worked with their hands . " " Do n't make fun . It ends up being a more interesting story than you might think .... "
