Chapter One KARRIE ALBRIGHT LOOKED AROUND the crowded living room of the impeccably decorated SoHo brownstone and wondered again what the hell she was doing here . Another Friday night , another party with meaningless chitchat , vague passes from men who 'd sell their own mothers for a decent day at the brokerage and scathing looks from women who would n't be caught dead in anything less than designer labels . The saving grace was , of course , that she was here with Madison . Karrie had never quite figured out why the two of them kept getting invited to these soirees , given that neither of them were terribly hip , they preferred jeans to Dolce &; Gabbana , and they were n't in the same hemisphere when it came to income , but about two years ago , they 'd hooked up with marvelously witty book editor Nancy Kragen , and they 'd been included ever since . It was great to have a regular social outlet , and they 'd met some terrific women and a few nice men , but lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't believe in this nonsense , do you ? " Madison asked , her gaze focused on the door to Sonya 's bedroom . " Of course not . " The door opened and Karrie ducked to get a look at the infamous Madam Zora . Last month , one of the girls had had a candle party , the month beforethat , Madison 's friend Elizabeth had thrown a roll-your-own-sushi night . But this had to be the weakest get-together of the year . A psychic ? Please . " Are you going to sign up for a reading ? " Madison rolled her eyes . " I 'm not wasting my time . " " As if you have anything better to do . " Karrie cast a dismal gaze around the room . Women outnumbered the eligible men by three to one . She loved Manhattan but this was getting old . " Come on . We 're here . I ca n't bear to go home yet . You know what night this is , right ? " " Ah , yes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he goes through two cases of Rolling Rock beer . " " You 've got ta love three-floor walk-ups with paper-thin walls . " " That are more expensive than most five-bedroom houses in any other state . " " But at least the heat does n't work in the winter and there 's none of that noisy air-conditioning in the summer . " Madison nodded and had another big sip of martini . " Girlfriend , it 's tough for us young , gorgeous career gals . " Karrie 's eyebrows rose . " Gorgeous ? " It was true for Madison , of course , with her willowy figure and stunning blond hair . Karrie herself never considered her own looks to be anything more than passable . Her saving grace was that she did n't have to fight the weight battle too much , and that her hair was n't a disaster , but her mouth was too big , her eyes not big enough , and of course , being around the professionally beautiful women in New York could bruise anyone 's ego . " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play pretend , I really am leaving . " " Which is exactly why we 're going to see Madam Zora . " " Oh , no . " " Oh , yes . You and I. Together . " Madison shook her head . " I do n't know what Sonya was thinking . " " Probably trying to take our mind off the fact that we have a better chance of winning the lottery than we do of getting lucky tonight . " Karrie sipped her peach martini and watched a tall woman with dark waist-length hair and red lipstick emerge from the room . Her dramatically made-up eyes widened when Nancy , who looked ravishing , damn her , in a Prada wrap , asked her what happened with the psychic . " She 's amazing . Totally awesome . " The woman , who 'd never been to one of the regular shindigs , shook her head , her expression a haze of disbelief . " She knew everything about me . Even that I 'm engaged . " Madison poked Karrie in the ribs , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karrie hid a smile . " Come on , you chicken . What can it hurt ? " " Do n't make me do this . I hate this kind of stuff . You know I break out in hives when I 'm exposed to too much schlock in one evening . " Karrie laughed , but she was n't about to ease up on her friend . " Madison , do n't be such a wet blanket . Who knows , maybe she 's going to see a tall , handsome stranger in your future . " " Yeah , right . " " Okay , so she wo n't . But do it anyway . Please ? " " Fine . " " Okay , then . " Madison caught a passing waiter and exchanged her empty glass for another martini . " You 're really not nervous about this ? " " Of course not . It 's all nonsense . " Karrie grinned . " Good . Because I put our names down an hour ago . We 're next . " Madison glared at her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle party fame , emerged , her face flushed , the sparkle in her eyes an odd mixture of fear and excitement . Which was strange , because Camilla was n't the type to be snowed by a con game . Karrie suddenly had second thoughts . Maybe this was n't such a great idea . What if Madam Zora predicted something bad about Karrie 's job ? Like that she would n't get promoted to Public Relations Director when her boss retired at the end of next year ? Or that she 'd lose the apartment on Sixth , even though she 'd been on the waiting list for over a year . Her thoughts suddenly turned to her brother , stationed in Germany . If Madam Zora ... No , it was all twaddle . Pure guff . Nothing but the science of watching people and playing the odds . Psychics kept things so general the facts could fit hundreds of people . Even if Madam Zora guessed Karrie had a brother , she was n't going to know anything real about him . Now that she thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was her bad . Regardless of psychic predictions , his job as an air force pilot was n't without risk . Like her , he 'd been desperate to leave Searchlight where they 'd grown up and he 'd joined the service the day he was eligible . Karrie had used a college scholarship to escape the small desert town , and since their mother had remarried and left five years ago , neither of them had returned to Nevada , or the shabby trailer that had provided no privacy , only a lot of shame . She swallowed and turned back to Madison , who was busy nibbling a blini with a dollop of sour cream and a smidge of caviar . " You do n't think she 'd predict anything bad , do you ? " Annoying amusement lifted Madison 's eyebrows . " Like what ? " " I do n't know . Like a death , or something . " ( Continues ... )
