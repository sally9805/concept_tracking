Revolt Against the MRS // Imagine it 's Mother 's Day , and you are being taken out to one of those god-awful brunches where you and hundreds of other mothers will be force-fed runny scrambled eggs and flaccid croissants by way of thanking you for the other 364 days , when instead of the brunch you get " Mom , you shrank my sweater in the dryer and I need a new one by tomorrow , " or " All the other mothers will be at the hockey banquet , " or , simply enough , " I hate you . You never listen to me ! I wish you were n't my mother ! " As you walk toward the restaurant , you notice broadsides posted on the telephone poles all over town . They begin , " Today , one day of the year , America is celebrating Motherhood , in home ... church ... restaurant ... candy shop ... flower store . " Obvious enough . But then the tone changes . " The other 364 days she preserves the apple pie of family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male ego and profit . She lives through her husband and children . " Now things get more radical . " She is sacrificed on the altar of reproduction .... she is damned to the dreary world of domesticity by day , and legal rape by night .... She is convinced that happiness and her lost identity can be recovered by buying - more and more and more and more . " // Or a bunch of women are handing out flyers . They are titled " Notice to All Governments " and then demand " Wages for Housework . " ( Yes ! ) They read : " We clean your homes and your factories . We raise the next generation of workers for you . Whatever else we may do , we are the housewives of the world . In return for our work , you have only asked us to work harder . " As a result , " we are serving notice to you that we intend to be paid for the work we do . We want wages for every dirty toilet , every painful childbirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every smile . And if we do n't get what we want , then we will simply refuse to work any longer . " The result ? " Now you will rot in your own garbage . " The broadside ends with " We want it in cash , retroactive and immediately . And we want all of it . " Oooo-weee . Do n't you think this would make Mother 's Day a lot more , well , interesting ? // The poster described above actually appeared in Cleveland on Mother 's Day , 1969 , courtesy of The Women 's International Conspiracy from Hell ( WITCH , founded in 1968 with the express purpose of staging outrageous and often very funny profeminist actions ) . " Wages for Housework " was a feminist broadside as well , one of many that appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s denouncing the fact that housewives and mothers were overworked , underpaid , and very much underappreciated. // Once upon a time , and not so very long ago , millions of women across the country , many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why women , and housewives and mothers in particular , were second-class citizens , consigned to financial dependence on men , relegated to do housework that was necessary , endless , yet looked down upon , and why women were deemed to be the only gender who should give up everything in exchange for raising children . Young women started wondering why they should get married at twenty-one , let alone eighteen , if that meant getting chained to the diaper pail all the sooner . Simply put , motherhood became political . // Welcome to the Women 's Liberation Movement , which was , for those involved , lots of hard work , scary , exhilarating , dangerous , exasperating , infuriating , and fun . " Fun ? " you ask . " Were n't feminists these grim-faced , humorless , antifamily , karate-chopping ninjas who were bitter because they could n't get a man ? " Well , in fact the problem was that all too many of them had gotten a man , married him , had his kids , and then discovered that , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , their own identity , their own aspirations , time to pee , or a brain . And yes , some women indeed became bad-tempered as a result . After all , no anger , no social change . But to see that you had common cause with other women , to fight for your rights , to believe that you could change the world , your very own future , and that of your kids - all this was bracing , invigorating . So we want to unearth from the graveyard of history the brazen , outrageous , passionate things that women dared to say about motherhood and child-rearing in the late 1960s and early 1970s so we can see how far mothers have and have not come since those heady , rebellious days . // As outlandish as the expectations are today surrounding intensive mothering , they are hardly the fault of feminists . Feminists never said , " Hey , great , mothers are working ninety hours a week as it is , let 's add a forty-hour-a-week job on top and not ask Dad to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feminists were the ones who tried to make motherhood less onerous , less lonely , less costly to women . Look at Gloria Steinem 's hopes for the future , printed in U.S. News and World Report in 1975 . She predicted , " Responsibility for children wo n't be exclusively the woman 's anymore , but shared equally by men - and shared by the community , too . That means that work patterns will change for both women and men , and women can enter all fields just as men can . " Well , we 're not there yet , but if you are a mother and have your own salary , let alone a job you find remotely rewarding , a day care center near you , after-school programs , maternity leave ( however stingy ) , a daughter who gets to play soccer or basketball , a partner who understands that making lunches , finding baby-sitters , and taking the kid out in the stroller are not entirely your responsibility , and if you stay at home and see this as a choice and not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionized by feminism . // Nonetheless , one of the reasons so many women say " I 'm not a feminist , but ... " ( and then put forward a feminist position ) , is that in addition to being stereotyped as man-hating Amazons , feminists have also been cast as antifamily and antimotherhood . Since we are feminists and mothers ( and married , too , to men we actually like ) , and in point of fact know lots of unabashedly doting mothers who are also feminists , a question persists : How , exactly , have these stereotypes been sustained ? // Sometime in the 1980s , in what we imagine to be a deep , subterranean grotto filled with stalactites , bats , and guano , a coven of men and women came together with an apparent simple mission : to rewrite the history of the women 's movement and distort what feminists said and did . We 'll call this group the Committee for Retrograde Antifeminist Propaganda ( CRAP ) . The high ministers of CRAP have included - but have hardly been restricted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Phyllis Schlafly , Anita Bryant , Pat Robertson , John McLaughlin , and George Will , to name a few . Because they were always invited to hold forth on political talk shows , or hosted their own ( sponsored by GE , or cures for male-pattern baldness , or God ) , they got to rehearse the CRAP version of history on a regular basis , which is how you turn something that is false into something everyone starts to take for granted as true . The CRAP version of women 's history was essential to the promotion of the new momism , because the alleged evils of feminism made the new momism seem all the more reasonable , natural , inevitable , and just plain right . Of course , millions of women see through the CRAP line and would rather leave the planet for a space station than inhabit a world designed by Pat Robertson ( who , we remind you , blamed September 11 , 2001 , on feminists and other evildoers , like gays ) . But the CRAP line has nonetheless sustained major misconceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , by administering the patented " Full o ' CRAP " quiz . What was the very first thing feminists attacked in the late 1960s and early 1970s ? If you answered " motherhood , " that is the correct CRAP answer . ( If , however , you said " patriarchy , the fact that women made fifty cents to a man 's dollar , widespread discrimination against women in education and employment , and the assumption that the only things women 's tiny little brains were capable of handling was scraping cradle cap off their kids ' scalps , " then maybe you were around in 1970 or have read some real history and know what actually happened . ) Who did these feminists hate the most ? The correct CRAP answer is " stay-at-home moms " followed closely by " children . " ( Now , do n't go saying things like " Wait - I remember Gloria Steinem insisting that housewives were getting ripped off because they did so much invaluable work that was unpaid , " because that does not fit into the official CRAP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a view and a history that CRAP has sought - with considerable success , we might note - to super-glue to what passes for our national " common sense . " CRAP put forth two versions of the antifamily feminist man-hater . The first - Limbaugh 's feminazi - is the never-married , child-loathing battle-ax in steel-toed boots . The second is the overly ambitious careerist who may , indeed , have kids , but neglects them in favor of her work . At the core of both versions is their alleged hatred of kids and of " real " mothers . // Let 's just briefly sample a typical CRAP offering . In 1999 , CRAP sent forth one of its high ministers , Danielle Crittenden , queen bee of the notoriously antifeminist Independent Women 's Forum , with her very own CRAP history , What Our Mothers Did n't Tell Us : Why Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman , to much media fanfare . ( Danielle should never be confused with the fabulous Ann Crittenden , whose 2001 book The Price of Motherhood is must reading for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for anyone who has a say in policies affecting parents and children . ) The book is a primer on the importance of the new momism . The " us " in Danielle 's title refers to twenty- and thirty-something women , and " our mothers " refers to women who in the 1960s and 1970s got " taken in " by feminism . Even though these fem-bots excoriated motherhood , they decided to have children anyway . ( " Why ? " remains one of the innumerable mysteries of the book. ) // According to Crittenden , young women today are deeply unhappy and confused because they ignored the siren song of the new momism and instead followed the really bad advice of their feminist mothers , who allegedly told their girls to forget marriage and motherhood . Instead , feminist mothers supposedly insisted that happiness only comes to those who climb the corporate ladder by impaling men 's balls on their Ferragamo heels . ( We are both card-carrying members of the feminist axis of evil , and we know of no mothers of twenty- and thirty-something daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want grandchildren . I want you to get that promotion and work seventy hours a week instead of sixty . " ) Having heeded their feminist mothers ' advice , these loser young women have " postponed marriage and childbirth to pursue their careers only to find themselves at thirty-five still single and baby-crazy , with no husband in sight . " ( No mention of the fact that once you remove the 10 percent of guys who are gay , and the other 30 percent who are snorting wasabi till they puke because they saw it on Jackass , the pickings can be slim. ) // How did Crittenden determine that most women in America are miserable because they have failed to embrace the new momism ? Instead of talking to actual , real women , she scanned the previous thirty years of women 's magazines like Cosmo and Glamour , and concluded that " ... my contemporaries are even more miserable and insecure , more thwarted and obsessed with men , than the most depressed , Valium-popping , suburban reader of the 1950s . " Not only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages is the inevitable outcome of certain feminist beliefs . " If she checked out a less glitzy source , Statistical Abstract of the United States , she would have to confront the fact that 80 percent of women between the ages of thirty and thirty-four in the 1990s had married at least once , and that the figure rises to 86.5 percent for women aged thirty-five to thirty-nine . True , some of these women divorce and do n't remarry immediately , but the specter of an entire generation of women with " no husband in sight " is not borne out by what scholars refer to as " numbers . " ( This is hardly statistically valid , but none of the college women we meet in our classes ever want to go back to 1957 . It , like , scares them. ) // So let 's get back to the actual feminists , not those of the CRAP imagination , and remind ourselves why they might have , for example , handed out leaflets at the New York City Marriage License Bureau that asked , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marriage is a ' Slavery-Like Practice ' " ? To review briefly , in the late 1960s , men got paid more than women ( usually double ) for doing the exact same job . Women could get credit cards in their husband 's names but not their own , and many divorced , single , and separated women could not get cards at all . Women could not get mortgages on their own and if a couple applied for a mortgage , only the husband 's income was considered . Women faced widespread and consistent discrimination in education , scholarship awards , and on the job . In most states the collective property of a marriage was legally the husband 's , since the wife had allegedly not contributed to acquiring it . Women were largely kept out of a whole host of jobs - doctor , college professor , bus driver , business manager - that women today take for granted . They were knocked out in the delivery room , birth control options were limited , and abortion was illegal . Once women got pregnant they were either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were women of color , it was worse on all fronts - work , education , health care . ( And talk about slim pickings . African American men were being sent to prison and cut out of jobs by the millions. ) // Most women today , having seen reruns of The Brady Bunch and Father Knows Best , and also having heard of Betty Friedan 's The Feminine Mystique , the bestseller that attacked women 's confinement to the home , are all too familiar with the idealized yet suffocating media images of happy , devoted housewives . In fact , most of us have learned to laugh at them , vacuuming in their stockings and heels , clueless about balancing a checkbook , asking dogs directions to the neighbor 's . But we should not permit our ability to distance ourselves from these images to erase the fact that all women - and we mean all women - were , in the 1950s and ' 60s , supposed to internalize this ideal , to live it and believe it . //       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
