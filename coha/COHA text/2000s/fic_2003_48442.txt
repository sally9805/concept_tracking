With Apologies to Grendel Briarton <p> ON A DECEMBER TRIP to Frostbite Falls , Minnesota , Ferdinand Feghoot was summoned to the local college , Wossamotta U. by Inspector Fenwick , the Chief of Police . There he was confronted with an appalling scene . Bullwinkle , the town 's leading citizen , had been smashed flatter than a kippered herring by a falling safe . <p> " It 's a common enough means of death for cartoon characters , " Fenwick opined . " Every year we lose five or six citizens to falling safes . But this time it was no accident . This time , it 's murder ! " <p> He showed Feghoot the ingenious deadfall trap rigged to rain financial ruin on an unsuspecting victim . Bullwinkle 's antlers were still entangled in the tripwire . Grasped tightly in one hand was a small statue of a Hindu god . <p> The dead quadruped 's best friend , Rocky the flying squirrel , had been with Bullwinkle at the time of his death , but when questioned by Feghoot the distraught rodent said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene upon , of all things , a pogo stick . Fenwick immediately issued an APB for the rabbi . <p> " You 're wasting your time , Fenwick , " said Feghoot grimly , as he stood from his examination of the body . " The rabbi has been framed . When you find him , he will tell you of some elaborate ruse that induced him to be on a pogo stick at this time and this place . " <p> " How do you know that , Feghoot ? " asked the Inspector . <p> " This is the work of the Christmas Killer , " Feghoot declared . " I have been on the trail of this fiend for years , and I fear we might never catch him . Every December he arranges one of these grisly messages . Look ! Did n't you notice the smile on the victim 's face ? The corners of his mouth have been propped up ... by these ! " He displayed two toothpicks he had taken from Bullwinkle 's mouth . <p> " I still do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Fenwick . <p> " Is n't it obvious ? " Feghoot asked . " Wee Vishnu , a merry crushed moose , and a hoppy Jew near .
