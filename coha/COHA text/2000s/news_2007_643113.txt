<p> Central banks around the world acted in unison yesterday to calm nervous financial markets by providing an infusion of cash to the system . But stocks still fell sharply in Asia and Europe , and in early trading in New York , before they recovered and closed essentially flat for the day on Wall Street . <p> As in recent weeks , the markets moved in wild swings  --  sharp drops were followed by steep gains and vice versa  --  underscoring the uncertainty . Investors weighed concerns that losses in the American mortgage market would deepen and spread against their faith in the ability of a strong global economy to withstand additional shocks . <p> Hoping to provide some comfort that there is ample cash available , the Federal Reserve made its largest intervention since the markets reopened Sept. 19 , 2001 , in the wake of the terrorist attacks . The central bank injected $38 billion into the financial system on top of the $24 billion it put in on Thursday . <p> The intervention steadied the markets  --  at least for the day . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gain of 0.55 point , and the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 31.14 points , to 13,239.54 . For the week , the Dow was up 0.4 percent , the S. &; P. 500 rose 1.4 percent and the Nasdaq was up 1.3 percent . <p> The question that remains is just how exposed the financial system and the economy are to losses in the credit markets and the increase in borrowing costs . The answer will set the agenda at the Federal Reserve , which finds itself confronting its first major financial crisis under the leadership of Ben S. Bernanke , who took over last year . <p> The Fed will be guided by its assessment of how much do banks , hedge funds , pension funds and others stand to lose and whether consumers and businesses will be able to stomach higher interest rates and stricter loan underwriting . <p> " There are a lot of risks in front of us , " said Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab . " Financial crises , in the past , when not accompanied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But , she added , " if the economic landscape deteriorates much from here , then we are going to have to suffer through a more difficult market period . " <p> That debate , Ms. Sonders and others agree , will not be resolved anytime soon , which suggests that markets will remain choppy as information about failing hedge funds and mortgage companies dribbles out . <p> Investor anxiety has been so heightened in recent weeks that days of stability have been shattered by the first sign of trouble tied to the debt markets . <p> Volatility , as measured by one popular index of options trading , has surged to its highest levels in more than four years , though it remains far lower than it was early this decade and in the late 1990s . <p> The financial sector has been among the most volatile  --  stocks there fell by as much as 1.7 percent during the day , only to climb as much as 1.1 percent before closing little changed . <p> Shares of Countrywide Financial , the nation 's largest mortgage lender , and Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both companies said they were facing a harder time selling loans and could potentially have problems raising money . <p> While those stocks recovered much of their losses for the day , they are both down significantly for the year . <p> A common pattern has been a surge in trading late in the afternoon , around 3 p.m. , that has often sent stocks higher , as it did yesterday  --  though on some days , like Thursday , the move has been just as sharp on the downside . <p> Richard X. Bove , an analyst at Punk Ziegel &; Company , noted the trend in a recent note to investors and suggested that the reason was strong buying from portfolios that use computer models to buy and sell quickly , a practice known as program trading , or a foreign source like the investment arm of the Chinese government . <p> " We are talking about such a sizable amount of buying and volume goes up and stocks react strongly one way or the other , " Mr. Bove said . " What I have trouble with is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> But he acknowledges that the pattern will probably not last long , because as sophisticated traders figure it out they will jump in on the other side to profit from the trades . <p> Using data from the New York Stock Exchange , Ms. Sonders of Charles Schwab estimates that program trading accounted for about 40 percent of all trades on the Big Board in recent days , up from the 30 percent range earlier this year . <p> " That 's why we are getting these swings , this is professional- to-professional trading , " she said . " This is money that has a time horizon measured in minutes . " <p> Indeed , there is evidence that the average individual investor has not been a big player in recent days . <p> Flows into mutual funds that specialize in American stocks were essentially flat for the week that ended on Wednesday , according to AMG Data Services . But investors put $36.2 billion into money market accounts , the largest weekly inflow this year . Investors often put cash into money market funds , which earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest in the market . <p> It is not surprising that individuals are sitting on the sidelines , given the sharp moves in the market . Yesterday , for instance , all three major American indexes fell immediately after the opening bell , and at one point the Dow Jones industrial average was down 212 points . By noon , stocks were on the rebound and the indexes were briefly in positive territory , then declined . The Nasdaq finished at 2,544.89 , down 11.60 , or 0.4 percent . <p> " You ca n't invest into a market that does that , " Mr. Bove said . " You have a better chance at making money on the craps table than in this market . " <p> Treasury prices were little changed yesterday . The 10-year note fell 9/32 , to 99 18/32 and the yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , rose to 4.81 percent , from 4.77 percent on Thursday . <p> Earlier , stocks in Japan , Hong Kong and Australia dropped by more than 2.5 percent . The benchmark Kospi in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 2004 . Most major European indexes plunged by 3 percent or more . <p> In both Asia and Europe , fears about the American housing market prompted investors to sell assets and forced commercial banks to reel in credit lines . <p> Central banks around the work stepped up efforts to slow the losses . The Bank of Japan added liquidity for the first time since the market problems began . <p> The European Central Bank injected money into the system for a second day , adding another 61 billion euros ( $84 billion ) , after providing 95 billion euros the day before . The Federal Reserve yesterday added $19 billion to the system through the purchase of mortgage-backed securities , then another $19 billion in three-day repurchase agreements . <p> In Washington , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr . spent the day in what his aides said was hourly contact with the Fed , other officials in the administration , finance ministries and regulators overseas and people on Wall Street  --  where until last year he had worked as an executive at Goldman Sachs . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies and among the financial regulators and are monitoring the situation carefully , " said Michele Davis , the Treasury Department spokeswoman . " Beyond that , we are not commenting . " <p> As investors in Asia sold off assets considered relatively risky , like Philippine stocks , they bought those considered safer , like Japanese government bonds . Asian currencies like the Thai baht also retreated against the dollar and more liquid and stable currencies like the yen . <p> " Everyone 's been talking about a credit crunch , and not surprisingly it turned into one , " said Jan Lambregts , head of Asia research at Rabobank . <p> While Asian banks did not seem to be directly affected , he said , " the main problem is we do n't know who is bearing the losses , and that kind of uncertainty is creating the situation that we 're in right now .
