Two guys , two bikes , two months , one robbery , and Headnote eleven hundred miles of mountains , jungles , and white sand By Wil S. Hylton Photograph Photograph // I am lost.Or rather , we are lost . My buddy Lou and 1 , two skinny yanquis in the middle of Cuba , drenched with sweat , doubled over our bicycles , gasping for breath , exhausted . It 's late and dark and hot and sticky . We 've come sixty miles today , lugging two hundred pounds of equipment , and despite our best efforts to stay on the main road , we ended up here , inside a field of sugarcane . Yes , inside it , buried in it , wedged between twelve-foot stalks , which arc over us like a canopy , painting the navy sky in narrow black streaks . We 'd happily get on our bikes and cycle out of here if only we knew where " here " was , if only we knew which way was out . I 'm holding our map under Lou 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I hear a sound in the distance . A low , rattling sound . Lou and I exchange relieved glances as we wait , listening to the noise approach ; then a young cyclist in cotton pants and boots emerges from the stalks . " What 's the problem ? " he asks , smiling . " Lost , " I say . " We 're trying to get to Jaguey Grande . " He shrugs . " I 'm going that way . You can follow me . " We pedal behind him , and after a few miles , he stops at an intersection . " I have to go straight . You should turn left , " he announces , looking expectant . But just as I 'm reaching into my bag for a tip , his hand snakes out , grabbing son@bin from my handlebar pouch . And then he 's gone , disappeared into the night , leaving behind only a slight suction sound , a whispered whooph that nearly evaporates in the breeze . For a second , I 'm dazed , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was just a plastic baggie . But it happened to be an important baggie . It was the baggie with my camera , my glasses , my driver 's license , my passport , and almost all our money . " What was that sound ? " asks Lou , straining his eyes in the darkness . " He took my shit , " I mumble , dumbfounded . " What shit ? " " Everything . " Lou 's quiet for a minute , then straps on his helmet . " Let 's go after him . " We mount our bikes and take off as fast as we can , but it 's soupy with blackness and we 're fatigued , and after only a few minutes , our pace falters . It 's hopeless . We 'll never find him . Not here . Not now . So we just cycle along slowly , hoping we 'll come upon a town . Darkness whirls by , warm breeze , sugarcane . In the hazy recesses of my imagination , I picture the guy 's shit-eating grin as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. passport , a New York driver 's license , and a palm-sized digital video camera . He 's probably wondering when the next flight leaves for Miami , Me , I ca n't even think about America . With no money and no passport-no identification whatsoever-I wo n't be going home anytime soon . 1 It seemed like a good idea at the time . Really , it did . Bicycle across Cuba . Sounds so ... dramatic . So stouthearted . So manly . And we were pretty sure that nobody had done it before . Not all of it , anyway . Not from tip to tail , not every painful latitudinal inch . After all , the western end of the island is a military zone . You need special permission just to enter . Even with permission , you 'd have a brutal ride : thirty-five miles over loose sand . After that , there are eleven hundred miles to go , through rain-forested mountains , across dry savannas , over winding dirt roads and diesel-dusted highways , knocking on doors for shelter , trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles from rusty public tanks . Cuba is bigger than Haiti , the Dominican Republic , Puerto Rico , Jamaica , the Bahamas , and all the U. S. Virgin Islands combined-no small feat to cycle . We doubted that anyone had even tried . // Of course , like so many big ideas , ours seemed gradually dumber as we looked into the details . For one thing , and we realized this would be important , neither of us knew anything about bicycles . I had n't even owned a bike in more than a decade . Lou estimated that he 'd cycled about two hundred miles in his life . Neither of us could tune brakes , adjust a derailleur , or even change a tire . We were what you might call , in bicycling lingo , idiots . Still , we began planning our route . We decided to start at the western tip of the island , in the military zone , for a variety of questionable reasons . For one , we thought it would be nice if our route began on the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like a sentence . For another ; we knew that the western end was flat , whereas the eastern end was mountainous , and we preferred to start with the flat part . Finally , we chose to start at the western tip because it 's closer to Havana , so if we ran into early trouble , it would be easier to pack up our gear and bail out . We estimated that the trip would take two full months , not because it would take that long to cycle across the island but because it would take us that long to cycle across the island . We chose October and November , in order to return home for Christmas with a tan . Then we got two Stumpjumpers and considered ourselves ready . We did n't bother to look at the precipitation maps or the temperature indexes . We did n't bother to consult any experts . We simply cleared our calendars for those two months , and when the first week of October arrived , we packed our stuff into Lou 's car and drove up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right in the middle of hurricane season . We 're just getting comfortable , lounging around a thatchroofed bar in Maria la Gorda , on the western tip of the island , when the hurricane strikes . It does n't look the way you 'd expect : terrifying , tormented , raging with electricity . Instead , it looks merely like a hard morning rain , and as we amble back to our room to prepare for the day 's ride , we think it 'll pass . We 're overconfident . Yesterday , we covered the first thirtyfive miles , the military zone , and it went more smoothly than we 'd expected . I took several falls when my bike hit the sandy patches , but it did n't matter because nobody was looking . We cruised along the southern shore , the nearly transparent water lapping at the white sand , and somehow we did the distance in less than four hours . Then last night , the military guards and some of the hotel staff toasted us at the outdoor beach bar , saying we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . So today we 're all ego , tuning our bikes in the rain , filling our water bottles from a public tank , unintimidated by the storm . But when noon rolls around with no break in the cloud cover , I start to worry . All around the hotel , employees are rushing around frantically , reinforcing windows with masking tape . It occurs to me that there 's probably a reason for this odd behavior , so I ask somebody , who breaks the news . It 's gon na be blasting at a hundred miles per hour . It 's gon na be here soon . When I tell Lou , he looks alarmed . " What 're we gon na do ? " he asks . " Start riding ? " I suggest . And sure enough , in half an hour , we 're on the road , hydroplaning wildly over potholes , trying to break through the burri-. cane 's wall . I 'm shrink-wrapped into my rain jacket , which is stretched so tightly over my backpack that I can barely move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've got all my luggage wrapped in plastic , but I know that everything is going to be soaked . The plastic was supposed to protect my things from rain . But this is n't rain . This is a hurricane . Riding against a **25;919;TOOLONG head wind is a Sisyphean affair , and it 's no use trying to enjoy the landscape , no use trying to make out the contours of the horizon . All we can see are gray streaks of rain growing dim as night falls . It 's five hours before we get to our destination . Sandino is all but invisible at night , a little huddle of cinderblock houses along the road , with about ten electric lights among them . Lou and I knock on doors , asking for a place to crash , and find an obliging family with two spare bedrooms , which we rent for thirty-five dollars . We hang our clothes on the furniture to dry , then lie down to sleep . Outside , the wind is howling , the rain is bucketing , and trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , when we stumble into the living room , we get our first glimpse of Fidel . He 's on TV , telling reporters not to worry about the hurricane , that it always rains in October and everybody ought to know that . He looks old but strong in military fatigues . His manner with the reporters is very personal , very informal , standing in a big crowd of them , leaning close to each questioner , smiling as if they share a secret . He reminds me of Bill Clinton , the way he affects a rural sort of warmth . After breakfast , we hit the road . Against the head wind , we go slowly , pulling into the next town at dusk . Sumidero looks a lot like Sandino , except the electricity is out , so it 's darker . We spot an old man standing on his porch , eyeing us in our spandex and our bulbous helmets . He waves us over , inviting us out of the rain , and we ask if he knows where we could spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he disappears down a muddy alley . A few minutes later , he comes back with a younger friend , who smiles under a straw hat and shakes our hands furiously , saying , Welcome , welcome , my name is Antonio , welcome . 2 The electricity is still out when we pull our bikes around to Antonio 's place , so we stand in the kitchen with his wife , Xiomara , who 's cooking beans and rice by candlelight . Xiomara has her straight brown hair cut to her shoulders . She has high cheekbones and a flirtatious smile , and she 's given her good looks to their daughter , Angelica , a nine-year-old with deep black eyes and rose-colored skin . When the lights finally come on , Antonio fixes a bath for Lou . First , he takes a bucket of water and drops a bundle of exposed wires in it , with two of the wires sticking out over the side of the bucket . Then he sticks the two stray wires into a wall socket , and the underwater bundle makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes the water is scalding . As Lou washes up , I sit with Angelica , who tells me about her schoolwork . She 's studying Cuban history , she says proudly . They 're focusing on the early colonial years , and she beams as she recounts the tale of Diego Velazquez , who sailed across the Atlantic in 1511 to stake his claim on Cuba . " For what country ? " I ask . She frowns , confused . " Do you know what country he was from ? " I ask again . Pursing her lips , tentative , she says , " The United States ? " Cuba has never belonged to the United States , but for more than two hundred years American politicians have been working to rectify that . In 1783 , our second president , John Adams , floated the idea of seizing the island from Spain . in 1801 , his successor , Thomas Jefferson , speculated that Cuba would be a " most interesting " addition to the union . And in 1823 , our sixth president , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba to a ripe apple that should be " severed " from the tree of Spain so that it could " fall to the ground " of the United States . But the first American to make a physical grab for Cuba was Theodore Roosevelt . It was 1898 , and Roosevelt was assistant secretary of the Navy , an undazzling position he bore with flush-cheeked ambition . Roosevelt was well aware that the Cuban people had spent three decades fighting for independence from Spain and that victory was almost theirs . Still , he decided to get involved , entering Cuba with six thousand soldiers , outnumbering the Spanish troops eight to one at San Juan Hill . In spite of the odds , Roosevelt and his Rough Riders suffered twice the casualties of the Spaniards and barely won the battle . Nevertheless , that same year , Roosevelt-still riding high on the victory-was elected governor of New York and became president in 1901 . ( It is a testimony to his facility with public relations that American children are still taught to call the Cuban War of Independence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a village just west of Havana . Photograph HOURS BEFORE REACHING the lighthouse , near Punta Maisi. // If Roosevelt was the first American to use Cuba as his personal launching pad , he certainly was n't the last . Over the next four decades , prominent U. S. businessmen , from du Pont to Capone , maintained discreet control of the island . They installed a series of corrupt presidents , who pandered to foreign investors and helped turn the island into a tropical country club where tourists ruled and the third of the population that was black was forbidden , in some places , to walk on the beach . To ensure tranquillity , the U. S. Army built a pair of bases , one on the northwestern coast , the other in the southeast . By the 19SOs , foreign interests controlled 90 percent of telephone and electric services , 80 percent of public railroads , and 70 percent of petroleum imports . Of course , most Cubans never saw an H. Upmann , let alone a Ben Franklin . A quarter of them were illiterate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The infant-mortality rate was astronomical , and by the late fifties , things were coming to a head . Though hungry and barely armed , many rural Cubans were ready to revolt against the Havana establishment . What they could n't predict was that they 'd find their leader in the heart of the Havana hubbub , in a young , ambitious lawyer , an idealist in his late twenties willing to wade in the mud for as long as it took to rise to the seat of power . By the time Lou and I pedal into Havana , we can see just how different the capital is from the rest of the country . We 've come two hundred miles in two weeks , battling our way across the Pinar del Rio province , a tumbling landscape of tobacco and sugarcane , of box-shaped mountains and vine-draped porches , where hunchbacked old men till the soil with oxen and children rush to the road when we pass , shouting , " Ole ! " 3 Havana , by contrast , is another planet , a modern metropolis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discotheques . We dig in and enjoy , but after three days of luxury , we begin to feel guilty , so we remount our bicycles and head east , back into the real Cuba , rural Cuba , the other forty-four thousand square miles . It 's a relief to be back on the bikes , and although we 'll miss the soft mattresses and air conditioning , we 're glad to be rid of the hustlers , or jineteros , who circle the streets of Old Havana selling illicit everything . In fact , we 're so happy to be away from them that we let down our guard . In the town of Matanzas , we ignore people who warn us to lock our bikes . In the town of CArdenas , we let a crowd of strangers mill about our equipment while we eat lunch . And by the time we get to the savanna near Jaguey Grande , we feel relaxed , even safe . Then it happens . Nightfall , the sugar field . Two skinny yanquis lost in the middle of Cuba . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full thirty minutes of cycling through night soup before we find a town . Another twenty minutes , and we 're telling our story to three cops . One of them wears a uniform . A second wears a white sweat suit . The third wears green fatigues . They walk us to the police station . The floor is littered with car parts and cigarette butts . I 'm put in a tiny office with three new cops . Two of them glare at me while the third spits out a series of rapid-fire questions : Name and address ? Married ? Parents ' names ? It occurs to me that these are strange things to ask a robbery victim . How did I get to Cuba ? What airline ? How big was the plane ? How much did my ticket cost ? Did the plane make any other stops ? Then he asks for my address again . Again about the price of my ticket . Again about my parents . At first , I 'm confused . I ca n't figure out where he 's going with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third time , it hits me : He is n't trying to help me ; he 's trying to trip me up . He thinks I 'm lying . 4 And as soon as I realize that I 'm being tested by this cop , I can feel my heart rate quicken . It 's 2:00 A.M. One of the plainclothes is asleep , snoring . Then the guy in fatigues comes into the room with a fifty-pound sack of oranges . In another room , Lou is answering the same questions . I realize that this is n't likely to be over soon . It takes two hours to convince the cops that we 're not spies , but they 're not done with us yet . They still have to hammer out a report on a manual typewriter , get a sketch artist to draw a picture of the thief , and send out an alert to the Cuban National Police detailing our description of the suspect . By the time they 're done , it 's morning . Outside , roosters are bleating freedom cries . Inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.M. , they throw us into an unpainted , unupholstered patrol car , which sputters and stalls and stinks of gasoline as it hurdles over potholes , heading back to the scene of the crime . We 're in the custody of about thirty officials , mostly out of uniform . They stand in the middle of the sugar field , arguing among themselves , waving their hands wildly , trying to guess where the thief might have gone . Lou and I fall asleep in the car . In midafternoon , they take us to another precinct for a lineup . Along the way , we are assured that the whole thing will be anonymous , that we 'll be looking through a one-way window . When we get there , two fat guys take us to the " one-way " window , which is actually just a square hole in the wall covered by venetian blinds . There 's no windowpane , and as soon as they 've lined up the suspects , they flip open the blinds , leaving me and Lou face-to-face with eight guys who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of them looks remotely like the thiefour guy was young , light-skinned , clean-shaven , muscular , and fairly short . We 're looking at tall guys with dark skin , skinny old dudes , even one guy with a full-grown goatee . After explaining this to the cops , they finally give up and take us to a private home where we can spend the night . It 's about 5:00 Pm . We huddle in our room , trying to figure out what to do . Two things seem clear : 1 ) The police have no idea what they 're doing . 2 ) They 're wasting our time . We decide to leave town quickly , but we are n't sure where to go . We know that we 'll have to go back to Havana if we want to get more money . But we also know that if we ca n't get money , we 'll have to go home . After three weeks and three hundred miles , we 're not ready to give up so easily . There are two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Bay of Pigs . Then we 'll talk about giving up . Fidel Castro never gave up . In 1952 , he made a bid for office , but a military coup canceled the election . The next year , he took up arms , leading a group of 120 revolutionaries in an attack on a military garrison . They lost spectacularly , and most of the survivors , including Castro , were deported to Mexico . Unfazed , Castro began preparing for another round . In Mexico , he and his men recruited a young Argentinean radical named Ernesto " Che " Guevara , bought a failing forty-foot yacht , and , with some difficulty , motored back to Cuba in December 1956 . They crash-landed on the rocky southwestern shore and hustled into the Sierra Maestra Mountains . 5 There , they set up an elaborate camp , with medical facilities , a dining hall , and a radio tower , from which they broadcast political dispatches across the island . in those broadcasts , Castro promised to build new roads , to provide free health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And fourteen months later , when Castro 's rebels advanced out of the mountains , they were joined in the streets by tens of thousands of peasants . By the time this makeshift army arrived in Havana , it was so great in number that the dictator , Fulgencio Batista , fled . Once in power , Castro began making good on his promises , building roads and electrical lines , schools and hospitals . To pay for these projects , he seized all the country 's large farms and factories . To him , it seemed fair enough , taking from the rich and giving to the poor . To the owners of those businesses , however , it seemed like theft . Those people were mostly American businessmen and the Cuban upper class . So it was no surprise when wealthy Cubans began fleeing in droves ; nor was it a surprise when the U. S. government took pity on them , creating the largest financial-aid program since the GI Bill , offering low-interest home loans , credit distributions , and job-training programs . And , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA project : a plot to overthrow Castro . Determined to reclaim their position in Cuba , hundreds of Cuban exiles signed up for that mission . They were flown to CIA bases in Guatemala and Nicaragua for training , and on April 17 , 1961 , they landed at the Bay of Pigs , a desolate swampland on the south-central coast of Cuba . Their plan was to take the beach , build a fort , and advance north to Havana . But the CIA had made one mistake : It had underestimated its opponents , or more specifically , had undercounted them . By April 1961 , Castro had given every citizen the title to his home and every poor farmer a patch of land to keep . He had closed the universities and sent educators into the countryside to eradicate illiteracy . Hospitals no longer charged for their services , and many food products were free . So when Castro made the call on April 17 for the Cuban people to defend their government at the Bay of Pigs , tens of thousands of young men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle was over . Almost twelve hundred invaders , all Cuban exiles , were captured , then ransomed to the U. S. government for $53 million in food and medicine . It would be the last transaction between the U. S. government and Cuba . To Americans , the Bay of Pigs is a battle . To Cubans , la Bahia de Cochinos is a place . And the Bay of Pigs is quite a place , surrounded on three sides by a marshland known as Zapata National Park . By the time Lou and I arrive , we 're more than ready for the soothing splendor of wilderness , and we spend a full day in the company of a bald , burly park employee named Francisco , who takes us out in a flimsy sedan , raising German binoculars to his eyes and pointing out dozens of species of birds-flamingos , herons , ibis , wrens , and the smallest bird in the world , the bee hummingbird , which hovers above a quarter-sized nest holding two tiny eggs . Francisco flashes delicate smiles , pauses at a watchtower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the day , we invite him out for a drink in the dining area of a crocodile farm , where we sip beers surrounded by reptiles lashing at the walls of their cages . 5 The next morning , Lou and I cycle farther south , to Playa Gir6n , the landing site of the Bay of Pigs invasion . As we pass through town , a tiny middle-aged woman with cropped hair and dark , glittering eyes rides up beside us on a blue Chinese bicycle , asking if we need a place to stay . When we say yes , she offers a room in her home , and we accept , following her to a colorless six-story apartment building , then lugging our bikes up three long flights of stairs . 7 Her name is Maritza and her apartment is an oasis of hue : blue walls , a yellow tablecloth , pink bedsheets . There 's a photo of Che Guevara on one wall and a collection of glass figurines on a small wooden bureau . We 're surprised to find a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing into our cleanest dirty clothes . With some coaxing , Maritza sits with us for dinner , but she does n't eat , saying she 's not hungry . She notices that I 'm sniffling from a slight cold and offers me medicine , a difficult item to obtain in Cuba . I accept , and she looks pleased , and somehow , as the evening progresses , we open up to her , tell our story , how we 've been robbed and have very little money , how we must return to Havana to see if we can get more . Maritza frowns , says that crime is very uncommon in Cuba . She apologizes in the name of all Cuban people , saying it 's terrible when one person makes the whole country look bad . She tells us that Cuba is a wonderful place and that she hopes we do n't get a bad impression , that she has a friend who can drive us to Havana , that she can keep our things at her house , can do our laundry for free , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our room and board when we return with more money . We 're stunned . This poor , single woman offering to help a pair of Americans-here , of all places , in the Bay of Pigs . When Maritza 's friend arrives the next day in his 1957 Chevy , we kiss our hostess on both cheeks , then make the drive back to Havana in less than four hours . Photograph A U. S. ARMY TANK , captured by the Cubans at Playa Giron . Photograph NEAR PUNTA MAISI , waiting for a bus back to Havana . // Once in the city , I suddenly feel alone , scared . We have less than $300 . We ca n't use American credit cards , because they are n't accepted by Cuban banks . We ca n't withdraw money from our accounts . We ca n't write checks . Nothing . The Western Union office will make transfers only to Cuban citizens , and even then there 's a maximum of $300 . On three hundred bucks , I could probably make it a month in , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuban economy does n't adhere to market principles ; you pay whatever the Cuban government feels like charging , which is usually more than you 'd like to pay . As far as Castro is concerned , the main reason you 're allowed in the country in the first place is because you 've got the cash to help save his foundering economy . Knowing this , we figure we 'll need at least three grand to finish our trip , and even that 's cutting it close . We check into a hotel and spend a restless night , wondering what sucker will be willing to send us so much cash . Before we can focus on money , though , I 've got to get a new passport . This is a little tricky , since there 's no American embassy in Cuba . Instead , I have to work through the United States Interests Section , a division of the Swiss embassy where a few American diplomats hang out , much to the chagrin of Castro , who routinely accuses them of espionage . When I meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regular American barbecue kings , sporting button-down short-sleeves and well-worn khakis . Without hesitation , they accept a blurry computer printout of my passport , which , thank God , I had on disk . Getting it off the disk was another adventure , but two days later , I 've got a new passport that says is SUED AT : REPUBLIC OF CUBA , CITY OF HAVANA . 8 I also ask the spies about money , and they tell me to have a friend wire money to the Department of State in Washington , D. C. , then it 'll be wired down to Havana . Hurrying back to my hotel , I call my editor , heart pounding . With a sigh , he agrees . The money is coming . Now all we have to do is survive while it processes . It takes a week . We get by on the kindness of strangers , begging at times . A family takes us in , feeds us , and allows us to spend three nights in their home without pay . It 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money arrives , I 'm sick and tired . We 've been in the country for more than five weeks , have cycled only four hundred miles , and during that time , we 've taken no more than four hot showers , eaten approximately seven decent meals . I 'm ready to give up , go home , leave the bikes with Maritza , and never come back . But I ca n't . We ca n't . We came here to discover Cuba , and now , for the first time , frustrated and exhausted , anxious and irked , with barely enough money to survive , I feel like we 've finally found it . Back at Maritza 's place , our spirits brighten considerably , and not only because she 's done our laundry , has a hot shower , and prepares a steaming plate of fried bananas with fresh fish , but also because she 's such a cheerful soul , chatting excitedly about her week and saying that she 's called several friends along our route who will be expecting us . In particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in Cienfuegos , the next stop on our itinerary . So in the morning , Lou and I take off for Casa Leonor . It 's one of our most tranquil afternoons , cycling along dirt roads , skirting the southern shore on the leeward side of the island . While it 's been several weeks since the hurricane , we pass countless houses with flooded yards , bridged from road to doorway with planks of wood . When we arrive in Cienfuegos , we 're surprised to find a modern city-or , at least , modern by Cuban standards . Leonor 's home turns out to be a sort of monument to communism , decorated with pictures of Lenin , Mao , Che , and Leonor 's husband , Armando , in his younger years , sporting military fatigues . These days , sixty-year-old Armando is short and wiry , wearing a yellow school uniform outgrown by one of his young friends . Armando was in his teens when the revolution began , and he fought at the Bay of Pigs . " I , like many people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy the bandits , " he recalls . " Everybody in Cuba receive military instruction . If one day the United States invade Cuba , the war never finish , because all the Cuban are soldiers in condition to defend the revolution in any moment and in any situation . " Armando and I spend the evening in his den , debating politics , while Lou snoops around the house , taking pictures of Leonor 's ancient kitchen appliances . Leaning back in his leather chair , wiping his hair from his face , Armando rails against " the capitalism . " 10 " In the United States , homeless . In Cuba , everybody have a home . In Cuba , do n't exist people that not have any means to life . Everybody have means to life . " Later , we settle in front of the TV for a speech by Castro , which turns out to be a denunciation of the U. S. embargo . After several minutes , I look at Armando from the corner of my eye , expecting him to be uncomfortable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . Next to him , Leonor is leaning back in a rocking chair , also asleep . I head for bed . Lou 's already out cold . I pull back the sheets on my bed , climb in , and disappear into a fantasyland , a paradise of beer and peanuts , unaware that as I sleep , Cuban immigration officials are hunting for us , carrying orders to stop our journey . Most Americans in Cuba do n't have trouble with the immigration department . Castro wants you there . After all , as an American , you 're more than just a walking wallet ; you 're a potential ally . If you have a good time in Cuba , you might speak out against the embargo . For Castro , that 's invaluable . The embargo is every bit as crippling as it was intended to be , prohibiting any foreign company from doing business with both Cuba and the U. S. If , for example , a British fast-food chain wanted to open a franchise in Havana , the company would promptly be banished from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss few companies are willing to take , and those that do take the risk generally prefer to ship top-dollar tourist items , like soda and cigarettes , not the low-revenue products that Cuban citizens need . As such , tourists rarely lack for amenities , while in the general population , scarcity is customary , dearth routine . There is one place where food and medicine enter Cuba from the United States without difficulty : the U. S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay . Located in the far eastern portion of Cuba , a landscape of sandy plateaus and cascading rocky cliffs , Guantanamo is hardly the " hot zone " that it 's made out to be in movies like A Few Good Men . Though the perimeter is surrounded by Cuban guards , forty years of stalemate have tempered the hostility on both sides , reducing confrontations to an occasional middle finger or mooning . The American side of Guantanamo resembles nothing so much as a suburban subdivision , freckled with shrubbery and cul-de-sacs , movie theaters , Laundromats , even a golf course . The Cuban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with disheveled buildings , tattered roads , stray dogs , and beggars , including one little girl in a ripped dress who keeps trying to steal money from Lou 's pocket . We check into a hotel on the edge of town , and we 're just starting to settle in when Lou and I are accosted on the back patio by a group of five men who tell us to follow them into an unused room . At first , I 'm skeptical , but when one of the guys produces a card that says IMMIGRATION , we go along without argument . 11 Inside the room , the windows are boarded shut and there 's no bed , just a telephone and a few plastic chairs that are difficult to see in the darkness . Right off the bat , the immigration guy starts thinking of reasons we should stop our trip . First , he instructs us to return to Jagi ! ey Grande and help the robbery investigation . Then he warns us that the roads ahead are poorly paved , that the mountains are too steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him that we do n't care about catching the thief , that all of the roads have been poorly paved , and that we 've been through a hurricane , he gets firm .

You know so much more about the system here than we do . " It seems to work . By the time we walk out of the room , he 's promised to call us by 5:00 P.M. with an answer from Havana . But when five rolls by , then six , then seven , we realize we 're being jerked around . Lou and I have a conference . Two things seem clear : 1 ) The immigration guy has no idea what he 's doing . 2 ) He 's wasting our time . We decide to slip out early in the morning . We 're only 120 miles from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there without getting caught . And the next morning , we 're off , heaving over mountains , spinning our pedals wildly on the uphills , then barreling down at forty miles per hour , then buffing it back up . By evening , we 're within fifty miles of the tip . All we want is to collapse on a bed-even a lumpy Cuban bed-but we know we can't. if we go to a hotel , we 'll probably be apprehended . So at dusk , we swerve off the - road. stash our bikes in some bushes , and spend a night tossing and turning on hard ground . 12 Sunrise , we hit the road again . Same thing : five-thousand-foot peaks , blistering sun , salt crystals on every skin surface . Only this time , we 're operating on about two hours of sleep , and when we arrive at a tenmile dirt road leading down to a lighthouse , we wonder if it 's an optical illusion . Our trip is supposed to end at a lighthouse on the eastern tip . Could this really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around on rutted mud and rocks , wobbling and groaning as we jump bumps and skid through slicks . And after half an hour , almost unbelievably , we 're there , staring over the windward passage toward Haiti , the first people ever to cycle across Cuba . 13 There 's a small staff working at the lighthouse-the operators , the cooks , a security guard , and a medic who 's wearing a Red Cross T-shirt and drinking moonshine out of a plastic cup . He offers me a shot , then another , and pretty soon I 'm getting tipsy as we stare out over the vast water , the sun dropping behind us . " I 'm drunk , " he mumbles , and at first I just nod , like , " Yeah , well . . . " But then he gets more serious . " I 'm drunk , but I 'm proud . " He juts out his jaw . " I 'm Cuban ! " With a flourish , aware that everyone is watching him now , he walks over and grabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War of Independence . " Cuban ! " he shouts , hugging the statue . " We 're with Castro until we die ! ' And somewhere in the back of my mind , something clicks . All this time I 've been agitated about not having a good time in Cuba . Because I like the idea of the place . I like the history , the people , and I like that it 's a social experiment , a grand , sweeping vision that reconstructed an entire country from the bottom up . The whole thing sounds great on paper , this share-andshare-alike bit , but being here , I 've been disappointed . I 've felt that the place is full of filth and squalor , that by my standards , it 's as free as prison . I 'm sure , in fact , that I 'd be miserable here , where I could n't leave my province without special permission , where the electricity goes out for half an hour a day , where information is controlled by the government . All this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I like the idea , but I have n't been able to . And yet , sitting next to this medic , this effusive , proud medic , I realize that I 've been disappointed precisely because I do n't live here . The people of rural Cuba , the people outside of Havana , the majority of Cubans , are n't comparing their nation to ours . They do n't know anything about us . They 're comparing their nation to what it used to be . And looking at it that way , a lot of Cubans are satisfied . In fact , most of the people we 've encountered are satisfied . Many of them not only like Cuba , they love it . Francisco loves Cuba . Maritza loves Cuba . Armando loves Cuba . Leonor loves Cuba . This drunk , happy medic loves Cuba . I do n't need to love Cuba . They do . And they do .
