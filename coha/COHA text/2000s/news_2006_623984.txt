<p> In the world of electronic toll collection , FasTrak is sitting in the slow lane . <p> Seven years after Caltrans switched on the high-tech toll system , about 39 percent of drivers in the technology-savvy Bay Area are using it to pay their tolls on the Golden Gate Bridge , the Bay Bridge and six other state-owned bridges  --  compared with about 70 percent on New York City 's bridges and tunnels and 75 percent on Illinois ' tollways . <p> The vast majority of Bay Area commuters pay the old-fashioned way , braking to a stop at the toll plaza and handing over cash to a person standing in a booth . FasTrak users slow down and roll past the toll booth while an array of gadgetry identifies their vehicles via an inkpad-size plastic device mounted on their windshields , then deducts the toll from pre-paid accounts . <p> Bay Area transportation officials are struggling to get FasTrak up to speed . In the past two years they 've offered temporary toll discounts for FasTrak users , added seven dedicated lanes at three bridges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened a new customer service center , started selling FasTrak transponders online and began advertising the system . <p> And they 've had some success . The percentage of drivers using FasTrak on state-owned bridges rose from 25 percent two years ago to roughly 39 percent . <p> But to climb higher , toll industry experts say , may require something Bay Area transportation officials have so far avoided and say they ca n't afford  --  <p> a regular discount . Other toll agencies have also had success with aggressive marketing efforts  --  including sales of transponders at grocery , drug or convenience stores  --  and continuing to open new dedicated lanes or eliminating toll plazas altogether for drivers who pay their tolls electronically . <p> Cash tends to be the most effective motivator , experts say . Most toll agencies offer discounts to those who pay with electronic passes like FasTrak or the dominant East Coast system , EZ-Pass . And systems with the highest use rates offer the biggest discounts . New York 's Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey offer discounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half what cash-users are charged . <p> " Price incentive is the biggest driver , " said Peter Samuel , editor of Tollroads News , a Web site that covers the tolling industry . " Giving a discount really works . " <p> The Bay Area Toll Authority , the regional agency that took over FasTrak operations from Caltrans last year , can probably drive use up to about 40 percent , Samuel predicted . " But to get it beyond that , " he said , " you need to offer a discount . " <p> Many toll agencies offer discounts in connection with an upcoming toll increase , boosting the toll higher for those who prefer to pay with cash , said Neil Gray , government affairs director for the International Bridge , Tunnel and Turnpike Association , which represents the toll industry . On the Illinois Tollway , for instance , when tolls were raised a year ago for the first time in 20 years , they were doubled for those paying cash while drivers using the I-Pass saw no increase . <p> Sales of I-Pass transponders boomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were seeing daily and weekly sales that equaled previous monthly sales , and monthly sales that equaled previous annual sales , " she said . " It was amazing . " <p> Rod McMillan , director of bridge oversight and operations for the Bay Area Toll Authority , said the authority plans to offer a one-month discount for FasTrak customers in January , when the toll on state-owned bridges rises to $4 . A four-month discount when the toll went to $3 in 2004 persuaded 70,000 motorists to sign up for FasTrak  --  the biggest boom since the program started . <p> But a regular FasTrak discount on the seven state toll bridges ( FasTrak users get a $1 discount from the $5 toll on the Golden Gate ) is unlikely , McMillan said , because the revenue from the increase must go to pay for the Bay Area 's share of the new eastern span of the Bay Bridge and the seismic strengthening of other toll bridges in the region . <p> " One month is a $5 million hit , and we can afford that , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term . It would be a tremendous hit . " <p> The toll authority , said McMillan , has discussed the possibility of charging higher tolls during peak commute hours and lower tolls at other times but has not considered boosting tolls for drivers who pay with cash . And while it can raise tolls to pay for the new Bay Bridge span , McMillan said , the authority needs legislative approval to boost tolls for other purposes . <p> While offering a discount may be the most effective way to drive electronic toll collection use higher , it 's not the only way , McMillan said , and the authority is in the midst of preparing a FasTrak strategy that it expects to complete in March . <p> Several agencies have gone beyond Internet and telephone sales to market electronic toll collection , putting transponders in retail stores . In Illinois , the toll authority enlisted the help of a popular grocery chain , Jewel/Osco , which sold the electronic toll tags at 200 Illinois stores without a markup or a charge to the tollway authority . For $50 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pre-paid tolls . They call an 800 number or go online to activate the device . <p> Kimberlee Poulton , spokeswoman for Florida 's SunPass electronic toll collection program for bridges and tollways , said an aggressive marketing campaign can also work . SunPass used radio advertisements , traffic-report sponsorships and highway billboards . It also started selling the electronic tags at Publix , the state 's dominant supermarket chain . And it has seen its overall usage jump from below 40 percent to 58 percent , and close to 80 percent during commute hours . <p> " If we had just done marketing , we would have seen a lift , " she said . " If we 'd just done retail sales , we would have seen a lift . But the combination is the reason for the success we 've had . " <p> SunPass can also be used to pay for parking at Orlando International Airport , and other Florida airports may join the program soon , Poulton said . The New York and Newark , N.J. , airports are also set up to allow electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's just another convenience , " she said , " and most people say they purchase SunPass for convenience . " <p> Some toll agencies , including the Illinois Tollway Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are taking convenience a step further , eliminating toll booths altogether , and instead using sophisticated overhead readers  --  a technology known as open-road tolling  --  that allow drivers to pay their tolls electronically without taking their feet off the gas . <p> McMillan said the Bay Area Toll Authority is looking at open-road tolling , retail sales and using FasTrak to pay for parking as ways to bump up its use . The authority also plans to work with Caltrans to open more FasTrak-only lanes . <p> " The more convenient you make it , " he said , " the better chance you have of signing people up .
