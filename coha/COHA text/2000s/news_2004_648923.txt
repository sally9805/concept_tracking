<p> Barry Bonds 's personal trainer , a prominent track coach and two executives of a nutritional supplements laboratory were charged yesterday with illegally distributing steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to dozens of professional athletes in football , baseball and track and field . <p> The indictments were the first to result from an investigation that began in August 2002 when federal agents began looking into the activities at the supplements laboratory , known as the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative , or Balco . <p> The allegation that the illicit drugs were sold to dozens of athletes seemed to indicate that their use was more widespread than has previously been reported . Nine athletes have been identified in news reports as failing tests for the steroid known as THG , which has been linked to Balco . More than a dozen athletes testified before the grand jury investigating the company . <p> The four men indicted yesterday were accused of conspiracy to distribute steroids , possession of human growth hormone and money laundering , according to the 42-count indictment handed down by a federal grand jury in San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Anabolic steroids are a controlled substance , and under federal law it is illegal to distribute them without a prescription . <p> The charges were filed against Victor Conte Jr. , 53 , who founded Balco and is its chief executive officer ; James J. Valente , 49 , the vice president of Balco ; Greg Anderson , 37 , Bonds 's trainer , and Remi Korchemny , 71 , who coaches the sprinters Kelli White of the United States and Dwaine Chambers of Britain . Ms. White tested positive for the banned stimulant modafinil after winning two gold medals at the world championships in August . Mr. Chambers tested positive for THG in October . <p> An affidavit that accompanied the indictment alleged a concerted effort by the men and the athletes to conceal the use of the illegal drugs . The scheme allegedly included the use of code names to disguise the kinds of performance-enhancing drugs being distributed , fictitious names on labels used for mailing the steroids , e-mail messages that warned against being caught and bogus explanations for athletes if they were caught . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a masking agent ; another , called " the clear , " was THG , the indictment said . <p> The indictments follow recent complaints by international anti-doping officials that American professional sports leagues and the United States Olympic Committee had failed to respond aggressively to the use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs by American athletes . <p> The issue was also raised by President Bush in his State of the Union address last month when he called on professional athletes , coaches and team owners to rid sports of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs . <p> Mr. Ashcroft , in his news conference at the Justice Department , said : " Illegal steroid use calls into question not only the integrity of the athletes who use them , but also the integrity of the sports that those athletes play . Steroids are bad for sports , they 're bad for players , they 're bad for young people who hold athletes up as role models . " <p> The existence of a federal investigation into Balco became public last September , after federal and county agents raided the company 's offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials of the American anti-doping agency said that an unidentified track coach had given them a syringe containing a drug that the officials said was tetrahydrogestrinone , or THG , a previously unidentified steroid that had been designed to avoid detection . <p> Mr. Conte has denied being the source of the THG , and his lawyer , Troy Ellerman , told Reuters yesterday that he would fight the charges . <p> Athletes like Mr. Bonds , Jason Giambi of the Yankees , the track star Marion Jones and the boxer Shane Mosley appeared before the grand jury . <p> Mr. Bonds , a San Francisco Giants outfielder who has been named most valuable player of the National League a record six times , has acknowledged being a client of Balco since before the 2001 season , during which he hit a record 73 homers . <p> Mr. Bonds weighed 186 pounds as a rookie in 1986 , and weighs 228 pounds now . He has attributed his weight gain to nutrition , weight-lifting and the use of legal supplements . He has steadfastly denied using steroids . <p> The drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for hospitalized patients losing muscle mass or bone . Its ability to build muscle mass makes it attractive to hard-training athletes looking to enhance their performance . <p> Some steroids convert food into tissue , particularly muscle , and such anabolic steroids can damage kidneys , harden arteries and increase blood pressure . Some kinds can be metabolized into estrogen , causing feminizing effects , and overdoses can shut down a man 's own testosterone , causing infertility or impotence . <p> " The tragedy of so-called performance-enhancing drugs is that they foster the lie that excellence can be bought rather than earned and that physical potential is an asset to be exploited rather than a gift to be nurtured , " Mr. Ashcroft said . <p> He stressed that the investigation is continuing . <p> " We do n't want to signal in any way that we are closing the book on this , " Mr. Ashcroft said , adding that more indictments are possible . <p> The 52-page affidavit , which was written by an Internal Revenue Service agent , accused Mr. Conte , Mr. Anderson , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled substances , including steroids and human growth hormone , " to numerous elite professional athletes at a local , national and international level . " <p> The I.R.S. agent , Jeff Novitzky , said that Mr. Conte laundered the proceeds of the illicit sales through his personal bank account . Mr. Novitzky cited dozens of personal checks from unnamed athletes that had been deposited into Mr. Conte 's personal account between February 2000 and May 2003 . <p> One check , for $6,200 , was " from the account of a current N.F.L. player , " Mr. Novitzky said in his affidavit . Another , for $7,350 , was " from the bank account of an elite track and field athlete and Olympic gold medal winner , " he wrote . <p> Mr. Novitzky also said he had examined the trash discarded outside Balco 's offices about once a week over many months . Among other things , he said he had found an empty box of vials of serostin , a human growth hormone ; an empty box of testosterone , an anabolic steroid ; an empty pill container @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Epogen , a prescription version of erythropoietin , or EPO , which is used by some athletes to increase endurance ; and dozens of syringe wrappers . <p> Mr. Novitzky said that medical waste from Balco had been tested and that several discarded syringes contained steroids . <p> He also said in the affidavit that he had found letters in the trash " from an elite track and field athlete , who is currently the United States champion in his event . " <p> He said the letter read : " Vic , here is a check for the next cycl . I need it by the end of the week . " The misspelled word " cycl " refers to cycle , which is a common phrase used to describe the taking of steroids on an on-and-off basis , according to the affidavit . <p> In addition , Mr. Novitzky provided examples of a half-dozen e-mail messages that were among hundreds that he said had been obtained through federal search warrants of e-mail accounts belonging to Mr. Conte and other defendants . <p> The e-mail messages " show Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeating steroid testing , attempts to keep these activities covert and concealing financial transactions , " Mr. Novitzky wrote in the affidavit . <p> One e-mail message that was said to be written by Mr. Conte and sent to someone identified only as an elite track and field athlete warned the athlete not to use both " cream " and testosterone gel , saying the combination would cause a positive test result . " Whoever told you that it is ok is a complete idiot , " said the e-mail message , which later warned , " Please understand that too much is just as bad as not enough . You are ready to rumble . It is time to run in the 49 's . " <p> The affidavit also said that among the retrieved garbage were two personal notes from an elite track and field athlete and world record holder . One dated March 24 , 2003 , read : " Victor , Thank you for the help at nationals ! " The other , with the same date , said : " Victor . . . Jim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that you did . All that I have accomplished this season would not have been possible without your support . Thanks ! ! " <p> In another e-mail message to a coach , Mr. Conte noted that " L=liquid , C=cream . " The e-mail message said : " L and C is what I gave you for your triple jumper . S is what they take before competition readily available in Greece . And remember that all e-mails are saved for a very long time , so be careful about how you say what you say . Searches for keywords like ' anabolic ' and many others are going at all times by big brother . " <p> The affidavit noted that anabolic steroids come in liquid and cream forms . <p> The grand jury has subpoenaed baseball 's drug-testing results from last year , but Major League Baseball and the Players Association are in discussions with the United States Attorney 's office to quash the subpoena . If the talks fail to keep the confidentiality of the results , baseball will probably go to court to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But three lawyers said it is unlikely that baseball will be able to prevent the grand jury from securing those anonymous test results . <p> " They 'll get the stuff , " said Stephen Saltzburg , a law professor at George Washington University who is a former deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division of the Department of Justice . " This kind of testing is not doctor-patient protected . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
