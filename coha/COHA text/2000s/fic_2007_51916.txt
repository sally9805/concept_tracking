" In case you needed proof that books can save lives - Michael Auberry , the 12-year-old who disappeared from his Boy Scout troop on Saturday in North Carolina , was found alive Tuesday morning in a remote mountain area , and a children 's book may have helped him survive . A few years ago Auberry read Gary Paulsen 's Newbery Honor novel Hatchet , about a boy who is deserted on an island after a plane crash and learns to live off the land , and some of its survival lessons may have sunk in . " I think he 's got some of that book on his mind , " his father told CNN . " - " Gary Paulsen , Lifesaver ? " , Publishers Weekly , 3/20/2007. " - and here to answer all your questions is Patrolman Ordway Dollarhide . As you know , Patrolman Dollarhide , along with his K-9 partner , Peanuts , was the brave and resourceful rescuer who discovered our lost camper , Michael Valentine Atreides , after a five-day campaign involving hundreds of searchers . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy is just too debilitated from his ordeal to attend . " Now , please welcome Patrolman Dollarhide . " " Thank you , Mayor Galliard . I appreciate the flattering introduction . But I was just doing my job . And to continue doing my job now , I find I have to take polite but firm exception to some of your characterizations of the case . " " Why , I - " " No , please , let me continue , Mayor . There 's no point in glossing over any of the details of this incident . It 's the sorriest mess I ever took part in , and if we hope to prevent anything like it from occurring in the future , it 's best to lay all the facts out straight . " " Well , go ahead then , Patrolman .... " " First off , Michael Valentine Atreides is not no little boy . He 's thirteen and weighs more than me . I figure him at around two hundred and thirty pounds , give or take a Twinkie or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Yollabolly Middle Eel Wilderness Area , and the temperature never fell below sixty degrees , even at night . So he could 've lived off that fat of his for about another month . His life was never in no real danger then . " " Still - " " I know , I know , it 's no fun for a youngster to be lost all alone , even under those mild conditions . And his parents were going plumb crazy with worry and fear . But the facts of the matter are , Michael prolonged his own troubles and made " em worse by his irresponsible actions . And they all came out of his reading . Books ! That 's what caused this whole dang misadventure . Nothing but books ! " I was in charge of debriefing the boy , and I took extensive notes . Notes which I 'd like to share now with you all . " First off , we got the reason why Michael wandered away from Camp Wanna-Beah-Ledge-Un in the first place . He claimed he was looking to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that comes straight outta those Tarzan books , stuff that thankfully never got in no Tarzan movie I ever seen . So right away you got him putting himself in harm 's way due to crazy notions he picked up from a book . " What 's he do next , when he gets a few miles into the woods and ca n't find his way home ? He keeps on playing Tarzan and starts traveling through the treetops . Lord knows how a butterball like him even did it without breaking his fool neck . But through the treetops he went , making it impossible for our dogs to find his scent . " So after a day or two he 's miles from where we expected him to be . Getting tired of Tarzan , he comes down out of the treetops . And what 's he do next ? He decides that he 's living in - and I quote the boy without quite understanding what he 's talking about - " an S. M. Stirling post-apocalypse novel . " " Now , he 's right by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed it downstream straight into Junction City . But does he ? No . Instead of using the common sense that God gave a grasshopper , he sets about trying to make a crossbow , to protect himself from " the Lord Protector 's soldiers . " " As you can imagine , he did n't get nowhere fast with that project , so he switches to playing Conan the Dang Barbarian ! The next thing we can figure , he 's climbing a set of cliffs with a stick for a sword , heading for a turkey vulture 's nest he 's seen , just so 's he can try'n bite the poor harmless bird 's head off ! That little maneuver throws the dogs off'n his trail even worse . But he survives that climb and ends up on the Parched Plateau . " By now it 's day three , but Michael Valentine Atreides ai n't done playing yet . " He was in a good spot to be found . The Parched Plateau is pretty bare and wide-open . The aerial searchers would 've spotted him right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some book called Dune , that he 's a " Fremen native , " and has to hide from everyone , including " sandworms . " He 's got a desert-pattern camo tarp with him . Did I mention he 's been lugging a knapsack full of books and whatnot around with him all this time ? Like he needs more goldarned inspiration ! So anyhow he uses this tarp to hide anytime a plane passes overhead . " Now right here is where I want to call Michael 's parents , Leia and Luke , to account . They 're the ones who aided and abetted his bookishness . He would 've been a normal kid if not for them . Turns out they 're what 're called " fans , " second-generation fans in fact , making Michael third-generation . They even changed their family name to one outta of this here Dune book . The shameful way they raised that boy , without a lick of reality-based common sense , is almost a crime . " But back to Michael . He makes his way across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into the Lonesome Valley . What 's he do down there ? seems the sight of an anthill , of all things , sets him off ! He decides he 's living in some book named City . He sets up what he calls a " huddling place " in a little cave , starts building a " robot butler " outta sticks and vines , and tries training up the ants to do his bidding ! " That 's where me and Peanut find him on day five , thank the Lord . But even then things could n't go easy . When Michael spots Peanut , he flips out . Why ? Well , you see , Peanut 's wearing doggie saddle-bags with his dogchow in it . Michael spots them innocent packs and starts screaming , " Puppet master ! Puppet master ! " He hightails it for a quarter mile before we could catch up to him . Guess nearly a week in the Yolla Bolly done improved his stamina somewhat , because back at Camp Wanna-Beah-Ledge-Un he never done nothing except lay on his bunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outta the Yolla Bolly , he kept on squirming and fussing , saying his name was " Han Solo , " calling me " Darth Vader , " and begging me not to " freeze him in carbonite . " That part might be movie talk , but I bet it 's in a book somewhere too . " And that , as I might put it , is all she wrote . " Now , I 'll be happy to take all your questions , if'n you can answer one of mine " Any of your reporter-types know a good literary agent for my story ? "
