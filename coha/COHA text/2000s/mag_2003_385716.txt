Section : Methods AND Materials <p> Matthew Hickey , of Huntington , New York , remembers a time when the subtle variations of skin tones were the hardest subject for him to paint . " I started out thinking I could use one set of flesh tones for every model , but it did n't work , " he says . " My figures looked like mannequins . My goal was to paint things the way I saw them , with accuracy and clarity . " Over time Hickey developed a system of base colors that he now successfully uses to achieve the subtle color variations found on the human body . He 's discovered that when it comes to painting flesh tones , beauty is skin deep . PRELIMINARIES <p> Hickey carefully adjusts the pose and lighting of the model before starting to paint . " I arrange the model to best show off the variations of skin colors , " he says . " I also do n't want the model to appear too posed . This is difficult if the model is just sitting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , using north light and my studio flood-lights , I place part of the head or body in shadow . I find that this contrast of light and shadow fortifies the three-dimensional illusion of the body . " <p> Once Hickey is satisfied , he completes many loose drawings , paints numerous color studies from life , and shoots two or three rolls of film for reference . " Photographs are very helpful when painting skin tones because they record details that I may have missed upon direct observation , " the artist explains . " For instance , I may see an obscure shadow that I did n't notice when observing from life . Also , I like to work into the wee hours of the morning , but then my original light has changed  --  and I ca n't expect a model to stay that late . The photographs solve both of these problems . " The artist warns not to rely on photos for accurate skin tones , however , adding , " They 're not a substitute for capturing the skin colors from life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered final drawing on gessoed canvas or linen , then loosely blocks in the hair and clothes and prepares to paint the skin . THE BASIC SYSTEM <p> Hickey centers his palette for flesh tones on five base colors : cadmium red light , alizarin crimson , cadmium yellow deep , burnt umber , and a mixture of 2 parts burnt umber to 1 part alizarin crimson . He lightens these with a titanium white to which he has added a tiny bit of Naples yellow to lower the intensity of the white . Hickey uses only high-quality artist-grade oil paint because he believes paint made of only pigment and medium helps him achieve the effects of skin more easily . Once these five base colors and white are on the palette , he begins his preparatory mixing . " I mix together the cadmium yellow deep and the cadmium red light and then add white to make five lighter values of the skin color , " he describes . " Next , I take the same combination of cadmium yellow deep and cadmium red light and mix it with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Hickey does n't view his palette as limited ; instead , he sees it as a base that demands adaptations and changes depending on the particular skin tones of each model . " I 've found this to be a good starting point , although I adjust both the hue and value of the colors as I go , " he explains . " I start by choosing the value most like the skin tone of my model . I 'll modify the paints by adding , most frequently , Naples yellow light , cadmium red light , and raw sienna for the lighter skin tones . " <p> Hickey says the colors an artist can add to the light areas of skin are endless . " Frequently I will add small amounts of light yellows , light reds , light browns , light blues , and muted greens for the light skin tones , " says the artist . " What I see in the skin of the model dictates the changes . In the darker areas , I start with a mixture of transparent gold , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent gold is one of my favorite ways of making the flesh look as alive as possible . Sometimes I adjust this by adding burnt sienna or ivory black , depending on how dark the shadow is . " Hickey also likes to use minuscule amounts of rose madder deep to " give a hint of redness when needed and to give the shadows a hotter , livelier mood , " he says . <p> The artist deliberately avoids paints labeled as " flesh . " He explains , " I ca n't think of a good reason to use flesh-colored paint . I find it too pink , too hot . Plus , when it 's mixed to different values , it 's too red . I do n't believe that even top-of-the-field portrait painters can turn flesh-colored paint into believable skin tones . " <p> Hickey uses a stiff medium containing 1 part damar varnish , 1 part Venetian turpentine , and 1 part stand oil because he likes the " viscous , gummy texture , " finding it perfect for building up colors with a scumbling technique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I put some medium on a brush , dip the brush into the color on my palette , and scumble the color onto the painting . The way previous colors shine through the subsequent layers creates the translucency of skin . The method gives me an incredible , very fleshy appearance of skin . For a highlighted area , one of my favorite techniques is to scumble white over a midvalue color that was mixed with a touch of rose madder . The redness of the rose madder under the white looks just like blood beneath the skin . In a situation where I have a very bright light directly from the window , I might even apply a titanium white and medium directly over a light-value color . " <p> Hickey says that painting flesh requires patience , and artists may not get it on the first try . " It 's important to go slow and not to give up , " he advises . " I recommend placing colors on the canvas and leaving them alone . " Hickey obtains gradual blends and a diffused light by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush or a badger-hair blending brush . He works with a wide variety of oil-painting brushes , although he will pick up a watercolor brush for fine details . INDIVIDUAL VARIATIONS <p> Variations in skin colors are caused by different amounts of melanin ( a brown pigment ) that is affected by the colors of hemoglobin ( red ) and carotene ( reddish-orange ) . Hickey observes that skin colors vary greatly depending on a person 's complexion , race , and age . However , the commonality of the pigment melanin allows Hickey to use the same palette for every model . <p> He begins by mixing a general tonal value of the model 's skin and later works on the nuances in the particular parts of the body . " Obviously with darker complexions I will mix more burnt umber into the colors because the initial pigment is darker , " the artist says . " For lighter complexions I use more white . " Hickey notes that he can use very light or dark colors on about any model . " It 's less about the tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin . It 's a process of trying , refining , scraping away , and trying again until I get the skin colors refined and polished . It does n't matter whether the paint builds up or remains thin . When the painting starts looking worse , I know it 's time to stop . " <p> Hickey notes that certain parts of the body are naturally more colorful . " Cheeks or the nose are redder on most people , " he says , " and as a final step I will apply a subtle glaze of rose madder or light pink to these areas . Then I will step back and judge how it changes the color structure of the painting . For veins under the skin , I like to mix in a small amount of green or cerulean blue into the skin color . Veins that are raised , like on the arms of a thin male model , often cast a small shadow that I can capture with a touch of burnt umber or Payne 's gray . " <p> According to Hickey , skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman is wearing makeup or the man has facial hair . But , he explains , " There is a real difference in skin coloration between children and adults . A child usually has flawless skin , so I have to make my colors lighter and not as intensely colorful . Darker colors will age the face of a child and are better suited for adults . <p> " A dynamic also exists between skin and hair color , " the artist adds . " A model with dark hair and light skin sets up a whole different scenario than does a model with red hair and light skin . As an artist , I have to pay attention to and compensate for these changes . If I have a model with a ruddy complexion and gray hair , I usually find the gray hair makes the skin look redder , so I will have to pull back on the red a bit in my painting . " Finally , the artist emphasizes the importance of watching how background colors can directly affect the appearance of skin colors . <p> PHOTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x 36 .
