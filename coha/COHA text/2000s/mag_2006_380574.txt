Is it possible for a major Hollywood studio to make a $50 million movie in which the hero is a terrorist ? A terrorist who appears wearing the dynamite waistcoat of a suicide bomber , and who utters the line  --  from beneath a full-face wooden mask that he never takes off  --  " Blowing up a building can change the world " ? A movie written and produced by the Wachowski brothers , the cyberauteurs who created The Matrix ? Starring Natalie Portman , shaved as bald as Demi Moore in G.I. Jane ? <P> These are not rhetorical questions . V for Vendetta , set for release March 17 , is that movie , and it is the most bizarre Hollywood production you will see ( or refuse to see ) this year . It 's the kind of film that makes you ask questions like , Who thought this was a good idea ? <P> It definitely started with a good idea .

V for Vendetta starred , instead of a superhero , a bitter , brilliant , at least half-insane resistance fighter known only as V , whose face was permanently hidden behind a grinning mask that , if you 're English , you recognize as the face of Guy Fawkes .

That was the sick , sad genius of the comic book : the government had taken everything from V , even his goodness . <P> You can see why all this would have appealed to Larry and Andy Wachowski , the band of brothers behind the Matrix trilogy . In the same way those movies did , V for Vendetta melds big ideas about power and liberation with futuristic blowuppy thrills . " I 've made a lot of stupid action films , " says Joel Silver , a producer on V. " But when we made the Matrix , we saw that people wanted more than that . " In the mid-1990s , back before Keanu knew kung fu , the Wachowskis wrote a screenplay of V for Vendetta . When Matrix mania finally subsided in 2003 , they had the time to get the movie made .

Instead of directing it themselves , they tapped James McTeigue , who worked under them on the Matrix trilogy .
