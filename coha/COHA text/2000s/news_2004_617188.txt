<p> Children 's issues <p> Gov . Sonny Perdue plans to push a child endangerment bill that includes penalties for parents who make methamphetamine . Georgia is the only state in the nation without a law that penalizes parents and caregivers who recklessly put children in peril or fail to keep them from danger . The governor is crafting legislation that would help protect children from abusive and reckless behavior . In recent years , however , efforts to pass a child endangerment law have failed , despite the efforts of Democratic Lt. Gov . Mark Taylor . Legislators working to get a bill enacted have had to mollify various groups who fear they would be targeted by its broad language . One worry is that overzealous prosecutors might try to punish well-meaning parents who make mistakes , such as the mother who turns her head for a moment and her child runs off . Late last week , the Perdue and Taylor camps said they would work together on the issue , which should avert any potential political problem that might threaten passage of a bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 180 school systems must hire more highly qualified teachers and force third-graders to pass the state 's reading test to earn promotion . Meanwhile , teachers are waiting for a raise . All of that , and much more , has to be done with less money . School advocates will push legislators to keep or increase funding for education , even though the governor has told all state departments to gird for more budget cuts . They will argue that federal- and state-mandated school reform wo n't come cheap and must be protected . If education funding is cut , legislators will be forced to consider  --  again  --  whether to delay or eliminate class-size reductions and other provisions called for in the state school reform package passed in 2000 . And while politicians  --  including the governor  --  favor giving teachers an across-the-board raise of 1 percent or 2 percent , that tab could reach $150 million . Meanwhile , Big Brother is watching . The federal No Child Left Behind Act has many expensive parts that must be protected  --  including testing , teacher training and technological upgrades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial holes in the Medicaid budget will be the biggest health care issue in this year 's session . Medicaid , which covers 1.4 million low-income Georgians , is expected to run out of money to pay claims in March . It needs $173 million to fill that gap . Later , the fiscal 2005 Medicaid budget could face severe cuts . Further , eligibility rules might be narrowed , which would dump thousands of poor people from the program . Meanwhile , medical providers could confront payment cuts . A potential wild card involves problems with the new Medicaid computer system , which has vexed providers . Another funding shortfall looms in the benefits plan that covers state employees , their dependents and retirees . Hospitals are expected to battle doctors over stricter state regulation of ambulatory surgery centers . A separate health issue is a proposal that would ban smoking statewide in public buildings , workplaces , restaurants and bars . <p>  --  Andy Miller <p> Ethics <p> Ethics reform , the victim of a bitter partisan battle in 2003 , will return in slightly different form in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by government watchdogs for trying to make public officials disclose more about their finances and those of their immediate family . The governor also set penalties for conflicts of interest , restricted gifts from lobbyists , barred donations between candidates and prevented governors from giving judicial appointments to contributors . But Perdue was criticized for seeking to engineer a Republican majority on the board and oust the commission 's executive secretary , Teddy Lee . House Democrats , who countered Perdue with a proposal to slash maximum contributions to statewide campaigns and reduce the governor 's authority to appoint state Ethics Commission members , let the governor 's bill die . " Last year , the House killed a chance for meaningful ethics reform in Georgia , " Perdue spokesman Shane Hix says . " And this year , we will give them another chance . " <p>  --  Ben Smith <p> Lawsuits <p> Georgia 's business lobby and its trial lawyers will face off again this year over tort reform . Last year , a $250,000 cap on jury awards for pain and suffering in medical malpractice lawsuits passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia Chamber of Commerce , the Medical Association of Georgia and the Georgia Hospital Association , Sen. Tom Price ( R-Roswell ) will try once more to pass tort reform legislation through the General Assembly . Price is expected to introduce a series of bills that would put a $250,000 cap on noneconomic awards in medical malpractice cases , limit venue shopping and grant limited immunity to doctors in emergency rooms . The medical community contends that runaway jury awards have caused malpractice insurance premiums to skyrocket and put some doctors out of business . The Georgia Trial Lawyers Association says the insurance industry is to blame for higher premiums  --  not jury awards . <p>  --  Bill Rankin <p> Atlanta and the state <p> Sewers : They are the topic of most discussions concerning the city of Atlanta , as they have been since Shirley Franklin took office as mayor . Already on the agenda is legislative approval of a $500 million loan , announced late last year by Gov . Sonny Perdue . The loans , which would come over 10 years but would have to be approved annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its crumbling sewer system . Last week , the City Council approved a compromise sliding-scale payment plan for customers who feared escalating sewer bills to pay for the $3.2 billion project . Also on the agenda is legislation allowing cities under court orders for infrastructure repairs to call a referendum for a five-year , 1-cent local-option sales tax . If approved , the bill would directly affect Atlanta 's sewer project , along with other municipal projects across the state . Other issues expected to come up during the session include the annual effort to incorporate Sandy Springs as a separate city and discussion , at least , about privatizing Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport . <p>  --  Ernie Suggs <p> Redistricting <p> The issue of where to place political lines supposedly was settled more than two years ago , but redistricting continues to split the Legislature  --  if only for the political ammunition it offers in an election year . " This is a tremendous story with big-picture implications , " University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock says . Republicans say voters are " continually offended " by misshapen , illogical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With two lawsuits still pending in federal court , the GOP state Senate will try to pry its own map out of committee in the Democratic House , while passing separate new congressional and state House maps to send over . In Washington , the U.S. Supreme Court , which seemed to rule last summer in favor of Democrats over Republicans , has asked three federal judges to revisit the previous state Senate map with new guidelines in mind . Meanwhile , in another case back in Atlanta , three other federal judges promise a quick decision that could force this General Assembly to spend time drawing new maps for legislative and congressional districts . <p>  --  Rhonda Cook <p> Transportation <p> Once again , leaders in metro Atlanta will push to change the way the state distributes transportation funding across Georgia 's 13 congressional districts . A proposal to exempt interstate projects from the funding formula could gain traction . The state Department of Transportation will seek legislative approval to create a bank to make loans to state agencies and local governments for transportation projects . Up for debate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highway Authority or the State Road and Tollway Authority , which issues state transportation bonds and operates the Ga . 400 extension . Advocates of commuter rail will push to fund a proposed passenger rail line from Lovejoy to Atlanta . Operating the line would cost about $7 million a year . Gov . Sonny Perdue is expected to ask for another $400 million in loans for transportation projects . The funding package would be similar in scope to one passed in 2003 , most of it to help fund rural road development . <p>  --  Duane Stanford <p> Water <p> After last year 's false start , state leaders are hoping to fast-track a bill for Georgia 's first effort at water planning . The controversy over whether farmers and industries could sell their excess water sunk a management bill in the final hours of last year 's General Assembly . For this session , the main players , including House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bob Hanner ( D-Parrott ) have agreed to a pure planning bill . Instead of legislation to prohibit water transfers between river basins , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We got the cart before the horse last time , " said Carol Couch , director of the state Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources . EPD is likely to be in charge of the water plan . Couch , a former biologist and hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey , said she has asked the governor for $500,000 to study creating a water plan . Early estimates are that the plan could take three years and cost $12 million to $18 million . It would assess how much water each region has and estimate future needs based on projected growth . <p>  --  Stacy Shelton <p> Payday loans <p> Critics have portrayed the businesses that offer high-interest , short-term loans as vultures circling outside the gates of military installations and in low-income areas in wait of gullible victims in desperate need of $100 to $500 in cash until the next payday . The industry , however , says the demand for " payday " loans is huge , even though interest rates rocket to three or four digits  --  it 's why the businesses have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbyists are asking for regulation , not criminalization . A key feature of the loans that target the working poor is that they can be " rolled " beyond the next payday  --  and often are ; the borrower still owes the original loan but also must pay interest and a renewal fee . Last year , the state Senate approved a bill that would make it a felony with a 10-year prison sentence to offer a payday loan , would allow victims to sue as a class and would allow the state to levy a 50 percent tax on the loans . House Banking Committee Chairman Johnny Floyd ( D-Cordele ) said the bill should be ready to move onto the House floor for a vote early in the session . <p>  --  Rhonda Cook
