<p> Human rights can be a fragile victim in a nation 's zeal to battle an enemy . We Japanese-Americans learned firsthand how , once lost , individual justice is painfully difficult to regain . <p> So it is that with every news story about Americans hashing through their uneasy post-9/11 relationship to all things with an " Arab face " - from the outright abuses at Abu Ghraib to the detentions without charge of " enemy combatants " at Guantanamo , to the lingering suspicions on America 's Main Streets - I 'm reminded of what it was like to be an " American with a Japanese face " during World War II . <p> It was 61 years ago that this newspaper published my account of being a nisei ( second generation Japanese-American ) , born in Seattle , college educated - senior class president at Whitman College - and forced to relocate to a resettlement camp surrounded by barbed wire . <p> " An American with a Japanese face , " as it was headlined , was written 17 months after Pearl Harbor . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalist I was , I read it now and recognize all the elements of fear , suspicion , and outrage contained in today 's stories of post-9/11 prejudices and injustices . Likewise , I see in it a good bit of the human kindness that peeked through the troubles of the time then - as they often do today . ( The article can be read at **26;1280;TOOLONG . ) <p> The 9/11 commission - which heard testimony about the security backlash Japanese-Americans suffered in World War II - touched briefly on the conundrum of security vs. civil liberties in its final report last week : " Our history has shown us that insecurity threatens liberty . Yet , if our liberties are curtailed , we lose the values that we are struggling to defend . " <p> Indeed , this is nothing new . But my own experience is an example of the difficult trial and error - and eventual adjustments - America , under its remarkable Constitution , is capable of . <p> My article told of the beginning of a fascinating , circuitous , ultimately rewarding American journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents ' modest Seattle home to the comfortable house alongside an Orlando area golf course where I write today . As well as my life turned out and as enjoyable and carefree as my retirement years have been , today , the shadow of world hostilities and the way they play out in our American experience troubles me . <p> The tragedies of 9/11 , like Pearl Harbor , have triggered shock and anger . And the resulting war has created hatreds and suffering that will affect us for a long time . As civil rights controversies mount in our " war on terror , " I feel that old knot of worry I once knew : Being perceived as an enemy by my own , beloved country . <p> More than 100,000 Japanese-Americans ( citizens and aliens alike ) on the West Coast were forced into relocation camps in 1942 because the Roosevelt administration - in the fearful haste of war - deemed us a military threat . We were charged with no crime and denied due process and equal protection out of racist motives . That 's clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different time . <p> The lessons of the past - that a foreign face does not always equate with danger - ought to give Americans today the courage to safeguard freedoms and the wisdom to protect the rights of all who are affected by hostilities of the moment . <p> Being an " American with a Japanese face " in 1942 was probably emotionally a lot like what people with an " Arab face " feel in America today . All told , I was incarcerated for 10 months and , after release , not allowed to return to the West for two years . <p> Our family 's journey started humbly 100 years ago when my father , a scared 15-year-old Japanese peasant , staggered off a creaky ship at a West Coast port after a month at sea . He 'd left home naively hoping to make his fortune as a contract laborer on a railroad construction crew in the western desert . Of course , he never made his stake and did n't return to Japan . Like many other young immigrants , he worked a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture bride . They settled in Seattle , where their two sons were born . <p> My role in the placid generational journey took a devastating jolt with Pearl Harbor in December 1941 . The brew of suspicion and fear started soon after as West Coast Japanese-Americans were rounded up and sent to camps . By May , my family - along with 6,000 other bewildered , apprehensive Japanese-Americans from Seattle - was interned at the Puyallup , Wash . fairgrounds . <p> When the government had announced the mass evacuation some weeks earlier , we were immediately placed on curfew and limited in our movement . We had tried to picture the incarceration - dreading it , despising it , denying it , and finally resignedly awaiting it . We knew we were n't the enemy , and the vast majority of us who did not resist told ourselves that if our government decreed that we be interned , then we must comply as our contribution to the war effort . <p> The reality of internment was even worse than feared . We all take freedom for granted . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were loaded on buses for the 90-minute ride to Puyallup . <p> My bride , Yoshi , and I held hands tightly as the caravan headed south . She 'd dropped out of college so we could be together in whatever our internment would bring . <p> How would it be behind barbed-wire walls , under watchtowers , living in one bare room per family ? Not easy . One June evening , Yoshi and I walked up the steep steps of the fairgrounds grandstand . From the top section we could see the green fields and the wooded hills beyond , soft and lush in the sweet summer dusk . We gazed silently at the countryside - so close and yet out of reach . But as tears ran down our cheeks , we could look no longer . We retreated to our sparse quarters near the livestock pavilion . <p> The summer was long , but we adjusted as best we could . I was on the recreation staff and planned the limited activities we were allowed . Yoshi worked as a librarian . And in August , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclamation area near Jerome , Idaho . Elementary and high school classes were started . Residents staffed a camp hospital . We even published a mimeographed camp newsletter called the Irrigator . We were coping . <p> A few months later , word came that those who could pass security and find employment away from the West Coast would be released . And the government reopened military service for nisei volunteers . Americans would learn of heroic young Japanese-Americans who fought in Europe and the Pacific after having volunteered from behind barbed wire . Their wartime service to prove their devotion to the US is a glorious chapter that aided immensely in postwar integration of Americans with Japanese faces . <p> Yoshi and I knew we must seek release from the Minidoka Relocation Center , go inland , and rebuild our lives . She was several months pregnant , and we did n't want our firstborn to join us in internment . <p> With prodigious help from Prof. Tom Howells , my journalism adviser at Whitman College , we found a small Missouri weekly newspaper willing to give me an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving our worried parents , started a new life in aptly named Independence , Mo . <p> " The pavement is wet this morning , " I wrote in that 1943 Monitor article , " glistening like diamonds where the sunlight falls across it . It is good to be out , walking past houses with neat lawns , flowering tulips and greening hedges . It is good to have somewhere to go in the morning , a place to work , and in the evening somewhere to return ... <p> " It has not been without interesting episodes . Three subscriptions out of 3,700 were canceled when residents heard of my boss 's negotiations to employ a ' Jap rat . ' One church had a stormy session ... of elders because a suggestion had been made to invite me and my wife to worship there ... and two war plant workers walked out of a restaurant because I was being served . <p> " On the other hand , people have gone out of their way to be kind . We have been invited to homes for dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People have been interested and friendly enough to stop and talk with us ... on the street . " <p> Friends and neighbors were as delighted as we with the birth of David , who we like to say " was conceived in a wartime concentration camp and born in Independence . " <p> After two pleasant years on my first news job , the Des Moines Register hired me , and with some misgivings we moved on . When World War II ended , I won a journalism fellowship at the University of Wisconsin . In the years following , Yoshi and I lived in Iowa , Minnesota , Missouri , and Florida as I pursued professional opportunities in academics , newspapers , and public relations . <p> Our world changes , but the idea of locking up groups of people does not necessarily . Some time ago , a friend got me involved in speaking to young jail inmates . I urged them to take advantage of their time - wherever it is . But I found that what moved them most was the fact that anyone actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in Independence , Mo . <p> Despite our current war concerns , I 'm hopeful that our diverse society will progress - if painfully sometimes - toward understanding and valuing human rights and safeguarding justice for all . <p> On my family 's long journey there were countless individuals who were kind and helpful without whom our lives would have been drastically difficult . <p> How far we have traveled . The children and grandchildren - even great-grandchildren - of those young interned Americans now enjoy the blessings of our diverse society . Their progress is a credit to them , but even more to a society that once incarcerated their forebears . <p> My Japanese face becomes less noticeable , and the younger generations blend more and more into their communities and an ever-evolving America . I hope someday that America 's Arab faces will enjoy similar blessings . <p> * Robert Hosokawa is a retired journalist who plays golf and likes to putter on the golf course looking for lost balls and good oranges that have dropped from the trees .
