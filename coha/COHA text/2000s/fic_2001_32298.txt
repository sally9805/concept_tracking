One Ruth walked down the narrow , crowded streets of Kir-hareseth , her mind and heart in turmoil . Her beloved husband , Mahlon , was dying of a lingering illness that had come upon him months earlier . She fought the sorrow and fear stirring in her . How would she live without Mahlon ? She 'd dreamed of living a long life with the man she loved , bearing his children , growing old with him . And now , she suffered watching him suffer . She grieved that there would never be children to carry on his name . But it was the new moon , and her mother was expecting her for her monthly visit . They would drink tea , eat the delicacies of her father 's table , and talk about family matters . Ruth dreaded this visit . She could n't keep her mind from her troubles . And she did n't want to hear what her mother thought was the cause of them . Poor Naomi ! How could her mother-in-law bear another loss ? Ten years ago , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , Kilion , had died last spring . Would Naomi 's faith in the God of Israel continue to give her peace , or would she finally crumble beneath the crushing grief of losing her last son ? Oh , Lord God of Israel , hear our cry ! From the time Naomi had told her about the true God , she had believed because she saw such peace in her mother-in-law . It was a peace that defied circumstances . Ruth had never seen such peace , certainly not in the house of her mother and father . She and Naomi had spoken often of God , especially when questions had arisen in Ruth 's heart . And the answers had always come down to trusting God , obeying Him , accepting His will , knowing there was a purpose in what was happening even if they could n't see it . But sometimes the pain seemed unbearable . And Ruth was afraid . Would she be inconsolable like her sister-in-law , Orpah , had been when Kilion died last year , wailing and rocking and refusing to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Lord God , do n't let me be a burden to Naomi . Give me the strength to help her . When she reached her father 's house , she took a deep breath , squared her shoulders , and knocked . A servant opened the door and smiled brightly . " Ruth ! Come , " she beckoned eagerly . " Come . " It was difficult to enter her father 's grand house with its expensive furnishings and not make comparisons to the humble abode of her husband . Here , everywhere she looked was the conspicuous evidence of wealthfine urns , rugs , beautifully colored linen curtains , low tables inlaid with ivory . She had grown up in this house and taken her father 's wealth for granted . Then she met , fell in love with , and married a young Hebrew merchant who was having difficulty keeping the family business going and , sometimes , keeping food on the table . Her father and mother took great pride in their possessions , but over the years of living with Naomi , Ruth had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a richness in Naomi 's life that had nothing to do with the house she lived in or the material possessions she had . " Ah , my beautiful daughter . " Ruth 's mother entered the room and embraced her . They exchanged kisses . " Sit , my love . " She clapped her hands , gave quick orders to a maiden , and sat on one of the plump scarlet-and-blue cushions . " Do you notice anything new ? " Ruth glanced around . Was there a new table or wall hanging or rug ? When she looked back at her mother , she saw her fingering a gold necklace . " What do you think ? It 's beautiful , is n't it ? A gift from your father . It 's from Egypt . " " He 's always been generous , " Ruth said , her mind drifting back to Mahlon . He 'd insisted she come today , insisted she leave him for a while . His mother was with him . Everything was fine . Go . Go and enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about was Mahlon and how quickly she could leave this place and go home to him , where she belonged . A servant entered with a tray laden with fruit , bread , two goblets , and an urn of wine . A second servant set down a platter of cooked grain with bits of roasted lamb . Ruth 's stomach cramped at the tantalizing aroma of the well-seasoned food , but she did n't extend her hand , even when her mother pressed her . How could she take a bite when Mahlon was too ill to eat anything at all ? How could she enjoy the delicacies her mother spread out on the table before her when her mother-in-law had nothing in the house but bread , olive oil , and sour wine ? " You must keep up your strength , Ruth , " her mother said softly . " You 're so thin . " " Perhaps in a while , Mother . " " Orpah 's mother spoke with me in the marketplace yesterday . Has everything been done that can be done ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was always hope , continued to pray and beseech God . She and Ruth both prayed . Prayer had become an unceasing habit . " Oh , my darling . I 'm so sorry you 're going through this . " Her mother reached out and placed her hand over Ruth 's . For a moment , she was silent . " What will you do when he dies ? " Ruth 's eyes filled with tears at the blunt question . " I will grieve . I will comfort Naomi . Beyond that , I do n't know . And I ca n't think about it now . " " But you must . " " Mother , " Ruth said softly in protest and then drew in a sobbing breath as she covered her face . Her mother rushed on . " I did n't ask you here to cause you more pain . I know how much you love Mahlon . If your father did n't love you so much , he would have insisted you marry Kasim , and you would n't be facing such anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're welcome to come home . And you know how much I 'd love to have you here with me again , even if only for a little while . You need n't stay with Naomi if Mahlon dies . Come back to us . " Ruth dropped her hands into her lap and stared at her mother through her tears . " After all Naomi has been through , could I leave her ? My duty is to my husband 's household , Mother . You know that . " " Naomi would be the first to tell you to return to us . Do you think she 'll want to stay here when her last son dies ? She will go home to her own people where she belongs . " The words cut into Ruth 's heart . Her mother spoke as though Mahlon was already dead and Naomi best forgotten . " I must go , Mother . " She started to rise . Her mother caught her hand . " No , please , listen to me . Naomi 's husband was eager to adopt our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always held herself aloof . She still dresses like a Hebrew . She 's never set foot in one of our temples nor given a single offering to any one of our gods . Perhaps that 's why she suffers so . Our gods are angry with her . " " She has a God of her own . " " Oh yes , and what good is he ? What has he given her but poverty and grief ? " She made a sweeping gesture . " Look around you , Daughter . See how the gods of Moab bless us . Look at what we have to show for our faith . " " But you 're never satisfied , Mother . " Her eyes darkened . " I 'm satisfied . " " Then why do you always want more ? Possessions do n't matter to Naomi . " Her mother released her hand angrily . " Of course not . Why would possessions matter to someone who will never have them ? " " You do n't understand , Mother . " " I understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to worship hers . And what good has come from it ? You 're being punished for it . Turn back to the gods of our people , Ruth . Leave that house of sorrow and come home . " Home to what ? Her father and mother had never been content . The more wealth her father accumulated , the more he wanted . Their appetites were ever whetted for increase . Nothing satisfied . In a few days , her mother would tire of the gold necklace she wore , and she would hunger for something new , something about which to boast . Naomi boasted in nothing but the God of Israel . And she found peace even in the midst of chaos when she went to Him in prayer . God , oh God , help me ! There are so many things I do n't understand . I have no answers for my mother . Can you hear the voice of a frightened Moabitess ? I do n't want my faith to die if You choose to take Mahlon from me . My mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wept . " We know you must stay with Mahlon to the end , Ruth . And we understand that you 'll want to stay for a few weeks after that and comfort Naomi . Fulfill your duty to her . Then come home to us , my love . Come home where you belong and where life will be so much easier for you . Everyone will understand . Naomi loves you . She 'll want the best for you , just as we do . There 's no need for you to live in poverty . You 're young and beautiful . You have your whole life ahead of you . " But Ruth could n't imagine her life without the man she loved or the mother-in-law who had opened her heart to her . How could staying a few weeks fulfill her obligation to Naomi ? Duty was not the only bond between them . There was also love . Not just love for one another but love for the God they both believed in . " I ca n't leave her , Mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father ? What about me ? Come home , Ruth . Please come home to us . How can I bear to see you live in such poor circumstances when ... " Ruth felt torn between her love for her mother and father and her love for Naomi and Orpah . If Mahlon did die , could she turn her back on them and walk away ? Could she go back to living the way she had before , bowing down to the statues representing the gods of her mother and father , gods she no longer believed even existed ? The bond she had with Naomi was deeper than a relationship by marriage . Ruth had come to embrace her mother-in-law 's beliefs in an unseen God . She had explained her new beliefs to her mother and father , and heard them laugh and shake their heads . " How can you believe such nonsense ? An unseen god ? " She loved her mother and father deeply , but she would n't turn her back on Naomi or the truth she had come to realize through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , Mother , just as Father became yours when you married him . " When her mother 's face crumpled in tears , Ruth embraced her . " You know I love you , Mother . I 'll always love you . But I must do what 's right . " " This is n't right ! You 're throwing away your life ! " Ruth saw that her mother refused to understand . Things could never be the same as they had been when Ruth was a child in her father 's household . She was a woman now , with a husband and a mother-in-law and responsibilities toward both . Her life did n't belong to herself anymore . And even if it did , would her decision be any different ? Oh , Lord , give me strength . I feel like a broken jar with all the oil spilling out . She had to tell her mother the truth . It would n't be fair to leave her with false hopes . " I wo n't leave Naomi , Mother . You have Father . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sisters and their families . If Mahlon does die , who will Naomi have left ? " " She will have Orpah , " her mother said stubbornly . " Let Orpah stay with her . " Orpah did n't believe in the God of Israel . She still worshiped idols and burned incense to Ashteroth . " Orpah is a kind and loving daughter-in-law , but she does n't share Naomi 's faith . " Her mother 's eyes darkened in anger . " How can you persist in believing in this unseen god of hers after all that 's happened ? It 's not fair that you give up your life for this ill-fated family ! If Naomi decides to leave , let her go ! " Ruth refused to be drawn into another argument about whose god had grander temples or the most elaborate and pleasurable worship services . She drew back and stood . " Mahlon needs me . I must go . " Her mother rose with her , weeping again as she followed her to the door . " Please consider carefully what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! Do n't throw your life away ! " Ruth 's emotions warred within her . Love ... grief ... impatience ... confusion . She turned and embraced her mother quickly . " I love you , " she said in a choked voice . " Tell Father I love him , too . " She released her hold , turned away , and hurried out the door . As she sped along the narrow city streets , she covered her face with her shawl so those passing would not see her anguish . Grief is deeper when the sun goes down and memories rise up with the moon and stars . The streets of Kir-hareseth were deserted now , everyone home and asleep , but Naomi 's mind was whirring as she sat at the end of her pallet , her back against the cold stone wall of her small house . She felt alone , even though her two beloved daughters-in-law lay sleeping within a few feet of her . They were worn out with sorrow . Each had lost a husband , Orpah first and then Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing their children , for they had none . My sons are dead ! My sons , oh , my sons ... Naomi wanted to scream out her pain , but for the sake of the young women sleeping nearby held it in instead . It was dark now , so dark the night closed in around Naomi , bringing with it fear and doubt . She tried to pray , but her whispered words seemed to bounce off the ceiling and land back in her lap unheard . And she began to wonder . Had God ever heard her prayers ? Had the Lord ever listened to her pleas ? Like the approach of locusts ready to feast upon her faith , the silence hummed inside her head . She pressed her hands over her ears and clenched her teeth . Why was the night like this ? Sometimes the darkness was so still she could hear her own blood rushing through her veins . The sound was like a heavy rain washing open the doors of her mind , flooding her with memories she wanted to forget . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're going to Moab whether you like it or not , Naomi ! There 's no famine there . " " But , Elimelech , we must n't leave Bethlehem ! It 's our home . " " Our home is turning to dust ! " " If we trust and obey God , He will provide . " " Are you blind ? Look around you , woman . God has abandoned us ! " " Because you and others bow down to baals ! " " I bow down to Baal because he 's the lord of this land ! " " Moses told our fathers the Lord is God and there is no other ! " " And what good has God done for us lately ? " Elimelech argued . " How long since rain last fell on our land ? When was the last time our crops produced even a little more than what we need to fill our own stomachs ? " " But you are saying it yourself , my husband . The Lord has provided what we need to survive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the one taking care of us , Naomi . I 'm the one working my flesh to the bones on this rocky ground and watching my crops die ! Do n't tell me God is taking care of us ! Look at my hands ! Look at the calluses and tell me it 's God who takes care of you and our sons . God stands far off and watches while everything I own turns to dust . He 's abandoned us ! You 're just a woman . What do you understand of these things ? I 'll do what 's right in my own eyes . " That same day , Elimelech had mortgaged the land he 'd inherited from his father . He 'd come home , packed their possessions on two donkeys , and taken Naomi and their sons , Mahlon and Kilion , away from Bethlehem . She 'd barely had time to bid good-bye to her friends and few remaining family members . Elimelech had been so certain he was making the right decision ! What man wanted to hear the constant dripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt she could do : she kept silent with her doubts and she prayed . She prayed in the morning when she first awakened . She prayed throughout the day as she worked . And she prayed when she lay down upon her pallet at night . She prayed and prayed and prayedand watched her life turn to ashes . Elimelech found work in Moab at Kir-hareseth . He cut off his locks of hair , shaved off his beard , and donned Moabite clothing to make his way easier . There were other Israelites sojourning in Moab and living in Kir-hareseth . They , too , had come to wait out the famine in the Promised Land , and they , too , quickly embraced the ways of the people around them and forgot the Law of Moses and the promises of God . It was summer when Elimelech died . " I just need to rest . " He 'd come home complaining of pain in his chest . " I 'll be fine in the morning . " He 'd sat right where she was sitting now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , grimacing . " Naomi ? " The strange catch in his throat had brought her to her knees before him . " What , my love ? " She took his hand and covered it with her own , wanting to comfort him . " Naomi , " he said again , the sweat beading on his forehead . He 'd looked terrified . " I only did what I thought was right . " His lips were blue . She 'd wanted to comfort him . She 'd held him in her arms and tried to soothe him . But nothing had helped ease his torment . Even now , after fifteen years , the grief rose up in her again , renewed by Mahlon 's untimely death , just as her grief had been renewed and deepened last year when Kilion died . There was no escaping the pain , no hiding from it , no pushing it down deep inside her anymore . She remembered everything so acutely , especially her unanswered prayers . She 'd prayed so hard that God would n't take her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and kept praying even as she watched the light ebb from Elimelech 's eyes . Then she prayed for mercy and saw death take him . Her sons had buried their father among Moabites . At first , she could scarcely believe Elimelech was gone . She kept thinking she would awaken from this nightmare and he would be there , complaining as always . When full realization had sunk in that she would never see him again , she had become angry with him . But that , too , passed . She had been too busy helping her sons put food on the table . It had been fifteen years since Elimelech died , and still the grief would rise up unexpectedly . It was never as sharp as those first weeks , but it never fully dulled . She had thought the pain of losing her husband was the greatest of all , but that was before she had lost sons . Now , she was drowning in a sea of sorrow . She could n't even pray anymore . She had always had a glimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now she felt God was beyond reach , His mercy not meant for her . All her prayers were like smoke blown away by an angry wind . Every one of them . Perhaps Elimelech had been right after all . God was standing far off , watching her suffer . God , where are You ? How do I find You ? She wanted to defend herself against His judgment . Had n't she pleaded with her husband to stay in Bethlehem ? Had n't she begged him to trust in God ? Had n't she prayed that God would change Elimelech 's mind and they would go home ? Had n't she wanted to return to Bethlehem when Elimelech died ? When God had taken Elimelech , had n't she tried desperately to convince her sons that they should go back to the land God had promised them ? But Mahlon and Kilion had been old enough by then to decide for themselves . " What is there for us , Mother ? This is our home . " Their hearts had been turned away from God and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than a bad memory to them , a place of hardship and heartache . Their father had never said a good word about it . Why should her sons want to return ? They knew little of Hebrew customs and laws , for Elimelech had neglected his duties . He 'd never taught his sons the history of the Israelites , the Law of Moses , the way of righteousness . Her sons had watched how Elimelech lived and done as he had done . When their father died , they listened to the elders of Kir-hareseth . They listened to the priests of Chemosh . They listened to their own desires and thoughts and did as they pleased , even unto taking Moabite wives for themselves . Oh , the grief her sons had caused her ! Nothing she had said to them had mattered . They loved her , but she was just a woman . What did she know ? So they said . So they 'd been taught to believe by their father before them . Naomi looked at her daughters-in-law sleeping nearby . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young women she 'd grieved over when first she heard about them . Foreign wives ! The shame of Israel ! Oh , how she had despaired . Yet she 'd managed to put on a smiling face when Mahlon brought Ruth home , and Kilion brought Orpah . What else could she do ? She could not bring herself to risk losing the love of her sons . And she 'd hoped to have some small influence upon their young wives . Now they were widows like her , and as dear to her as if they had come from her own womb . Nothing brings people closer together than shared suffering . She remembered in the beginning , she had accepted them and tried to build a relationship with each of them in order to keep peace in her house . And secretly , she 'd prayed that Ruth 's and Orpah 's hearts would be softened toward the God of Israel . If she could teach them about the Lord , perhaps there would be hope for the next generation . But now her last hope for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last spring . Then a lingering illness had brought Mahlon down . Kilion had died in the space of a few days , suffering little discomfort , but poor Mahlon had received no such mercy . When he fell ill , the suffering went on and on . She could do nothing but watch her eldest son , the firstfruit of Elimelech , be eaten alive by disease . She 'd prayed countless times for God to ease his suffering , for God to put all the sins of her husband and sons upon her , but the days wore on and on . Poor Ruth , poor faithful , loving Ruth . How many nights had the girl sought to ease Mahlon 's pain and ended up weeping over her helplessness ? Sometimes Naomi wished she could escape the city and run out into the fields and scream and tear her hair and throw dust over herself . She had wept when Mahlon looked up at her with the eyes of a wounded animal in agony , hounded by terror . Her own grief had almost consumed her during those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahlon often and gently of the mercy of the Lord . Mercy ! her heart had cried within her . Mercy ! Lord God , mercy ! While Ruth had ministered to her husband 's physical needs , Naomi sat by and told him about the signs and wonders God had performed in Egypt and in the wilderness , and in the land of Canaan . He could n't resist her now , but was he ready to repent and seek the Lord ? She told Mahlon how God had delivered the Israelites from Egypt , not because they deserved it , but because He had chosen them to be His people . She told him about Moses and the Law and how the people were stubborn like Elimelech and rebelled . She told him about the blessings and the cursings . And she told him about the promises . When he slept , she bowed her head and prayed . Oh , Lord , Lord ... She could n't find the words . Oh , Lord , search my heart ... . She prayed and prayed and prayed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and holding his hand when he died . She let out a long , anguished cry when he stopped breathing , then wailed and covered her head . Had it been only twenty-two days ago ? Orpah had tried to comfort her and Ruth by saying Mahlon would be at peace now ; his pain was over . Naomi wanted to believe these words , but they seemed hollow , without foundation . What did Orpah know of God ? Naomi 's sorrow was so deep that she felt paralyzed by it . All she could do was wait for the sun to rise so she could go on sitting in this dusty , dank corner and listening to the rush of people going past her door . How dare life go on as it always had , when her sons were dead ! She resented the laughter of neighbors outside her door . She was embittered by the changeless activity . Were her loved ones so unimportant they might have been mere grains of sand cast into the Dead Sea , leaving hardly a ripple ? Only Orpah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more with each day that passed . She hated these foreign people . And she hated herself for hating them . It was n't their fault Elimelech , Kilion , and Mahlon had taken up ways displeasing to God . Men decide their own path , but it is God who judges , God who prevails . The sun rose , and Naomi wished she could close her eyes and die . Instead , she found herself alive and aware of what was going on around her . She could hear Orpah and Ruth weeping together and talking in soft voices so they would n't disturb her . She ate when they asked her to do so and lay down when they pleaded with her to rest . But she felt lost and angry and hopeless and afraid . She wallowed in memories , thinking back over the early years of marriage with Elimelech . Oh , how they 'd laughed together and dreamed of a fine future brought by hard work and dedication to the land . Naomi , his merry one , he 'd called her . She remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anticipation , the celebration when a son was bornfirst one , then another . She had sustained them with her body , nursing them until they were able to walk . She had rejoiced in their childish exuberance , laughed at their antics , relished their presence . Life had been full then . She 'd felt God 's presence in every blessing . What do I have now ? Nothing ! I will never know joy again . Things had been bad in Bethlehem , but everything got worse when they left . She 'd triedand failedto have influence over Elimelech . She had wanted to raise her sons in the ways of the Lord , but Elimelech felt the Laws of Moses were too rigid , too intolerant . " Our way is not the only way , Naomi . Look around you and see how the Moabites prosper . Those in Bethlehem are still reduced to scraping out a living from the earth . " In her heart , she 'd known Elimelech was rejecting God , but she could never find the words to convince him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being punished ? Should I have been more determined in reasoning with Elimelech ? Should I have gone to the elders for help instead of being too ashamed to admit what was happening in my home ? Should I have gone to his brothers ? I should have found someone he respected who might have been able to dissuade him from leaving the land God gave us ! Perhaps if I 'd refused to leave Bethlehem , everything would have turned out differently . Perhaps if we 'd stayed , my husband and sons would still be alive . How she tormented herself wondering if she could have done things differently , worrying that she had failed those she loved so much . Oh , why did n't I teach Kilion and Mahlon the importance of the Law ? I should have been a better mother . I should have made them sit down and listen . I should have worried less about losing their love and more about losing their souls . And now I 've lost them forever . I 've lost my sons ... oh , my sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , but she was scourged with self-recriminations day after day and night after night . Father , forgive me . I was weak . I was foolish . I took the easy way and followed Elimelech because I wanted peace in our family . I did n't want to be a contentious wife . I wanted to support him in his endeavors . I wanted to be his helpmate . But You warned us of the cursings to come if we were unfaithful . Oh , Father , I wanted to be faithful . I tried to be faithful . Every day , I felt torn , my husband on one side and You on the other . I did n't know what else to do but pray in silence and hope in secret and walk alongside Elimelech and then my sons . I hoped and prayed every day they would come to their senses and we 'd go home to the land You gave us . Oh , God , I 've prayed and prayed all these years , and not one prayer has been answered . My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped me bare ! You have poured me out ! Who is left but You , Father ? What do I have to cling to now but You ? She rocked back and forth , moaning . Ruth rose and put her arms around her . " Mother , I 'll take care of you . " The girl 's tenderness broke Naomi 's heart . She wept in her daughter-in-law 's arms , allowing herself to be held and rocked like a baby . But it was no comfort , for other thoughts rushed into her tortured mind and made her cry all the harder . There would be no children to carry on the names of her sons . It would be as though they never lived at all . Their names will go down into the dust along with them . No children ... there will be no children ... Seventy days passed before Naomi went outside the door of her small house . The sunlight hurt her eyes . She was weak from grieving , having wept enough tears to fill a cistern , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to life . She must think of the living . Ruth and Orpah were young women , too young to spend the rest of their lives mourning over Mahlon and Kilion , or taking care of an old woman whose life was over . She sat on the stool outside her door and watched someone else 's children . They raced down the street , their laughter echoing back as they rounded a corner . Children were life , and hers were no more . But there was still a chance for her daughters-in-law , if she did what she knew she must . If she remained in Kir-hareseth , Ruth and Orpah would continue to live with her . They would spend their youth looking after the mother of their dead husbands . How could she allow these sweet girls to waste their lives on her ? She loved them too much to continue to see them begging for a handful of grain from strangers or living off charity from friends and relatives . But if she left Kir-hareseth and Moab , her daughters-in-law could return to their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fathers would find husbands for them quickly , for they were young and beautiful . Then Ruth and Orpah would have the joy of children . Naomi wanted that for them more than anything . As for her , she wanted to go home to Bethlehem . She did n't know if any of her relatives or friends remained there or had survived the famine , but she had heard that the famine had finally ended . Perhaps the Midianite raids had also come to an end . Even so , what did it matter ? She longed to go home , and she was willing to accept whatever she found when she reached Bethlehem . If she must be reduced to spending her last years as a beggar , so be it . At least she would feel the Promised Land beneath her feet again . At least she would be where others worshiped God as she did . Oh , Lord , make it be so . Bring me safely home before I die . Oh , Father , have mercy on me , for I 'm alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worse . And I want to do what 's right in Your eyes . Help me ! Neighbors greeted her as they passed by . She smiled and nodded her head while her mind raced on . Why am I sitting here ? Am I waiting for God to speak to me audibly as He did to Moses ? Who am I that God would speak in such a manner ? Do I expect Him to write a letter to me on that wall over there telling me what to do ? I know what I must do ! I will repent and return to my homeland . Naomi put her hands on her knees and pushed herself up . Lowering her shawl to her shoulders , she went back into her house . Ruth was kneeling , flattening bread dough and laying it over the metal stove , while Orpah was mending a garment . Both young women glanced up and smiled at her . She paused , gazing between them , trying to find words to explain , and failing . She turned away and began gathering her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , Mother ? " " I 'm packing . " " Packing ? " Orpah said . " But where are you going ? " " I 'm going home . " Naomi had known that Ruth and Orpah would insist on accompanying her to Bethlehem . Impetuous youth . She did n't argue with them ; she knew they would soon understand the immensity of leaving Moab and their families behind . She was sure they would be ready to go home again by the time they reached the Arnon River . It would be far easier to dissuade them at the boundary of their country than to waste her breath arguing with them now . She would enjoy their company awhile longer and then send them home . She did n't want to ponder the fact that she would never see them again after they left her . She would never forget them , and she would pray for them every day for as long as she lived . As they prepared to leave the house , Naomi wondered if they would even make it down the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The poor girl . She could n't bear to leave anything behind . She was loaded down with everything she had accumulated during her marriage to Kilion , including a small stool . Orpah moaned in distress . " Oh , I wish we could bring the table and rug ...

" Where are the rest of your things , Ruth ? " Naomi asked her . " I have all I need . Let me carry the cooking pan , Mother . It 's too heavy for you . We 'll travel farther today if I carry it . " Naomi had spoken to the family next door , telling them Orpah and Ruth would be returning in a day or two . She wanted to be sure no one bothered what was left in the house . When the young women returned to Kir-hareseth , they could sell everything , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't care about any of the belongings she was leaving behind . She preferred the plain things of her people to the finery of the Moabites , Philistines , and Egyptians . It was Elimelech who had placed such importance on the gifts he gave her , and they would be out of place in Bethlehem . She suspected that Ruth would give everything to Orpah . Dear Ruthshe had such a generous heart , not to mention a wealthy father who would want her to return to his house . Naomi knew him well enough to suspect that he already had another husband in mind for Ruth , a rich merchant 's son or an official in the king 's court . Her heart sank at the thought of Ruth married to someone other than her son . Curious ... the same was n't true of Orpah . Perhaps it was because Ruth had responded to her teachings about the true God . How Naomi had rejoiced as she watched the slow budding of the girl 's faith . " Did you see your father and mother yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? They should know you 're leaving the city . " " They will know that I 'm with you . " " Do they know I 'm going back to Bethlehem ? " " My mother said you would , and I told her that even if you did , I belong with my husband 's family . " Naomi said no more about it . She started off , carrying only a small sack of parched grain , a skin of water , and a leather bag in which was a sandalwood box containing crystals of frankincense . She would give it to the priest when she reached Bethlehem , an offering for the Lord . She felt a sense of relief as she walked through the gates of Kir-hareseth and saw the road before her . Whatever hardships came , at least she was on her way back to Canaan . She did n't look back . Orpah did look back , weeping softly , but Ruth merely smiled and gazed off toward the King 's Highway to the Dead Sea . " It 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day wore on and the sun rose , hot and oppressive . Naomi felt despair creeping into her heart . Soon she would say good-bye to these daughters . Lord , give me the strength to place their needs ahead of my fear of being alone . Father , bless them for their kindness to me . Take them safely home , and give me the courage to go on alone . At midday they stopped to rest beneath a terebinth tree . Naomi accepted the raisin cake and cup of water Ruth offered , but Orpah declined food . She was quiet , her eyes downcast . Ruth sat down and wiped the perspiration from her face . She looked weary but was more concerned about her sister-in-law than herself . " Are you not feeling well , Orpah ? " " I 'll be all right after a rest . " Naomi knew what was wrong , but the knowledge gave her no satisfaction . She must send them back now . There was still time enough for them to be safely back inside the city walls before nightfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own back the bundle Ruth had insisted upon carrying to this point . " What are you doing ? " Ruth said , rising as well . " I 'm going on alone . " " No , Mother ! " Orpah came to her feet and joined Ruth in protest , weeping profusely . " Do n't go ! Please do n't go . " Naomi 's heart broke , but she knew she must remain firm . " Go back to your mothers ' homes instead of coming with me . And may the Lord reward you for your kindness to your husbands and to me . May the Lord bless you with the security of another marriage . " Ruth wept . " No . " She shook her head . " No , no ... " She stepped forward . " We want to go with you to your people . " " Why should you go on with me ? " Naomi said , striving and failing to keep her voice from becoming strident with restrained emotion . " Can I still give birth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , my daughters , return to your parents ' homes , for I am too old to marry again . And even if it were possible , and I were to get married tonight and bear sons , then what ? Would you wait for them to grow up and refuse to marry someone else ? No , of course not , my daughters ! Things are far more bitter for me than for you , because the Lord Himself has caused me to suffer . " Ruth and Orpah wept harder . Orpah embraced her . " I shall never forget you , Naomi . May you have a safe journey home . " " Nor I you , " Naomi said and kissed her . " And a safe journey to you as well ! " Orpah took up her bundles and started back toward Kir-hareseth . She paused after a little way and looked back , perplexed . " Are n't you coming , Ruth ? " " No . " Ruth shook her head , her eyes awash with tears . " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to embrace her . " Are you certain , my sister ? " " Never more certain . " " Please ... " " No . Go back without me . I will go on with Naomi . " With one last look back , Orpah started off again . Naomi watched Orpah walk quickly away and then looked at Ruth . She stretched out her hand and pointed toward Kir-hareseth . " See . Your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods . You should do the same . " Tears slipped down Ruth 's face , but she did n't move . " Do n't ask me to leave you and turn back , for I wo n't . " " But how can I not tell you to go ? " Naomi came closer . " You heard what I said , Ruth . Should I take you back to Bethlehem with me so you can have the same bitter existence I 'll have ? Should you grow old without a husband and children ? Go after Orpah ! Return to your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weeping . " I wo n't leave you . Make me your proselyte . " Naomi 's heart squeezed tight . " Oh , my sweet one , think of what you 're saying . The lives of my people are not as easy as what you 've known . We 're commanded to keep sabbaths and holy days , on which we may not travel more than two thousand cubits . " " I will go wherever you go . " Naomi knew she must speak the truth , even if it hurt Ruth 's feelings . " We 're commanded not to spend the night with Gentiles . " " I will live wherever you live . " " We 're commanded to keep over six hundred precepts ! " " Whatever your people keep I will keep , Mother , for your people will be my people . " Naomi kept on . " We are forbidden to worship any strange god . Chemosh is an abomination ! " " Your God will be my God . " Naomi spread her hands . " We have four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning , strangling , and slaying with the sword . Reconsider your words ! " When Ruth said nothing , she went on , beseeching Ruth to see the many ways their people were different . " Our people are buried in houses of sepulchre . " " Then let it be so for me as well , Mother . " Falling to her knees , Ruth wrapped her arms around Naomi 's waist . " I will die where you die and will be buried there . " When Naomi tried to press her back , Ruth clung more tightly . " And may the Lord punish me severely if I allow anything but death to separate us ! " Weeping now , Naomi placed her hands on Ruth 's head and stroked her hair . Naomi looked up at the heavens . She had never hoped for this , never expected that this young Moabitess would be willing to give up everything in order to go with her . She looked down again , stroking Ruth 's head absently . " You will never see your mother and father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that ? " " Yes . " Ruth raised her head . Her face was streaked with tears . " Your life will be easier if you return . " " Oh , Naomi , how can I go back to my old life when you hold the words of truth ? " Her arms tightened again as she began to sob . " Please do n't plead with me to leave you . Do n't lead me into temptation . I 'm going with you ! " Your God will be my God . How could Naomi say no to such words ? Had n't she prayed that Ruth 's heart would be softened toward the God of Israel ? One prayer had been answered , one prayer among thousands . " Be at ease , " she said gently and loosened Ruth 's arms from around her waist . Cupping Ruth 's face , she smiled down at her . She smoothed away Ruth 's tears . " As God wills . Whatever comes , we 'll face together . " Ruth 's eyes shone as she smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I know you 'll teach me what I need to know . " " Everything I learned at my mother 's knee I will make known to you . All I have is yours . I give it to you with pleasure . " For Naomi knew now there was more than marriage to her son that had grafted this girl into her life and heart . And now she would pray that Ruth would be grafted in among her people as well . You have not forgotten me , Lord . You knew I could n't make it home alone . You have not abandoned me . " Come , " Naomi said , taking Ruth 's hand and helping her up . " We must make a long journey before we reach home . " Ruth did n't dwell on what hardships she and Naomi might encounter when they reached Bethlehem . Each day of travel was enough trouble to bear without fearing what might come when they reached their destination . Ruth had lived in fear all during the months of Mahlon 's illness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she could n't save him . All her efforts to make him better had failed , and the fear of losing him had n't prevented death from coming anyway . Nor had fear helped her face the difficulties of surviving without a man to provide for the household . After Mahlon 's death , she decided she would never again allow her mind to dwell on things beyond her control . The future was one of these things . She would face whatever came and do the best with whatever life God gave her . Naomi often comforted her without even realizing it . " The Lord will take care of us , " she 'd said last night , and Ruth had lain awake on the hard earth , staring up at the stars and thinking about those words . The Lord will take care of us . After all Naomi had suffered , she still clung to her faith . Ruth was comforted by Naomi 's strength . The Lord will take care of us . She chose to believe it because her mother-in-law said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , Ruth had known there was something different about Naomi . First there was the outward sign : her clothing . Even after years of living among the Moabites , her mother-in-law continued to dress as a Hebrew . She did n't do so with an air of pride , as though she was better than those living around her . It was simply who she was . Ruth had also seen her deep faith in God . At first , she 'd worried that Naomi 's long silences meant she did n't like Mahlon 's choice of a wife . But Mahlon had said that was n't so . " She 's just praying , " Mahlon told her with a shrug . " She 's done it for as long as I can remember . Do n't let it upset you . It does n't do any harm . Just ignore her . " But Ruth had n't ignored her mother-in-law . She could see that prayer meant a great deal to Naomi , and Ruth wanted to understand more about it . So she had surreptitiously watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she talked to her god , and at other times , anguished . Every morning , often at midday , and always during the evening hours , Naomi would draw her shawl over her head , sit in the corner of the house , and become still and quiet . Ruth asked her once what she prayed about , and Naomi had smiled and said , " Everything . " Her eyes had grown sad . " Mostly about my sons . " She 'd reached out and put her hand over Ruth 's , her eyes softening . " And my daughters . " The kind words had brought tears to Ruth 's eyes . Naomi 's good opinion had mattered very much , for Ruth admired her greatly . Naomi was kind and pleasant , fair in her division of chores , and she always worked as hard as everyone else . She loved both of her sons deeply and equally , and despite their cultural differences , she embraced Ruth and Orpah as daughters . Love seemed to be a gift Naomi had in abundance . And though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and wisdom in her mother-in-law , knowledge and wisdom she longed to share . Yet Ruth sensed her sorrow as well . Naomi was never quite settled in Kir-hareseth , never quite at ease with the world around her . It had to do with her God . Ruth had been afraid to approach Naomi and talk with her about it . So she approached her husband instead . Mahlon had never had much to say about the God of his people . In fact , he seemed to know very little about him . " Why are you so interested in God ? " " Should n't I be able to teach your sons about him ? " " Teach them about Chemosh if it pleases you . It does n't matter to me . I 'm sure my mother will teach them about Yahweh . The important thing is for them to be tolerant of all religions . That 's the only way they 're going to succeed in Kir-hareseth . " In Mahlon 's eyes , one god was no better than any other , but Naomi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ' beliefs , but she held to her faith in Yahweh with quiet tenacity . Ruth looked at her mother-in-law now , curled on her side , her head resting on a stone for a pillow . She 'd fallen asleep within minutes after eating the bread Ruth prepared for her . The sun was down and the air was cooling quickly . Ruth rose and carefully draped her shawl over Naomi . The journey was already very difficult for her mother-in-law . She had eaten very little during the weeks following Mahlon 's death . Ruth had feared that Naomi would waste away in grief . So she had prepared savory stews in an effort to entice her mother-in-law 's appetite . Now it was the physical exhaustion that dampened Naomi 's appetite . She was so tired after walking all day , she could barely keep her eyes open long enough to eat anything . It was strange , but Ruth felt as though they had traded positions . Naomi had become the child , and she the caring mother . " But I do n't mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . She smoothed the tendrils of black hair back from her mother-in-law 's sunburned brow . Ruth rose and hugged her arms close to her body , shivering slightly . Mount Nebo stood in the distance . Naomi had told her this morning that Moses had gone up onto that mountain and died there after putting Joshua in charge of God 's people . They had crossed the Jordan River soon afterward and claimed Canaan . She loved it when Naomi talked about what God had done for the Hebrews . She felt a strange stirring within her as she learned of His mighty feats and His unfailing love . She closed her eyes and lifted her face to the heavens . " Lord , help me to take care of your servant Naomi , " she whispered . " It 's because of her that I 've come to believe in You . Please guide our steps and bring us safely home to Bethlehem . And , Lord , if it is n't too much to ask , let there be old friends to greet Naomi upon her return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to love her in the difficult days ahead . "
