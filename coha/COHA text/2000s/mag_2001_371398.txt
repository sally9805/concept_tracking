Federal investigators suspected Zacarias Moussaoui of plotting terrorism even before Sept. 11 . He was arrested in August on immigration charges after he attracted attention in Minnesota by offering thousands of dollars in cash for lessons on how to maneuver a plane in the air  --  but not how to land . Since his arrest , many observers have said Moussaoui was to have been the 20th member of the Sept. 11 hijackers . <P> But several ranking investigators have told TIME they do not believe Moussaoui was part of the group . Not so much as an ATM receipt connects him to the hijackers , and he was inquiring about lessons well after the others had finished theirs . These same officials wonder if he may have been part of another radical cell . They now suspect that the 20th hijacker was meant to be RAMZI BINALSHIBH , 29 , a Yemeni who once shared an apartment with ringleader Mohamed Atta . On Sept. 21 , Germany issued a warrant for Binalshibh , naming him as an accomplice in the attacks . U.S. investigators believe Binalshibh tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hijackers but was denied a visa for unknown reasons . He wo n't be coming back soon ; he left Germany just before Sept. 11 , possibly for Pakistan . <P>  --  Reported by Elaine Shannon/Washington
