HERE WE ARE , STANDING IN THE DOORWAY AT LAST , bidding goodbye to the Year of St. Paul . It 's entirely possible that some Catholics never had a clue that , starting in June 2008 and running through the end of June 2009 , the church has been celebrating a year dedicated to Paul , the great " apostle to the Gentiles . " Still others - church professionals , mostly- have been inundated with books , materials , workshops , and reminders that our teaching , preaching , and guidance this year should be informed by the words of this unparalleled figure . At my house , it 's as if St. Paul 's been living in the guest room , hanging around all day , poking his nose into all of my affairs . One might think under these circumstances that I might be looking toward the end of this month with relief that I am finally able to send this extended squatter packing . And yet I have to admit I feel sorry to see him go . What comforts me is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an institution within the institution , and we could n't have pulled off 20 centuries of Christianity without him . So while his picture wo n't be as prominent in Catholic literature over the next year as it was in the last , it 's not like we 've heard the last of Paul . Not by a long shot . WHAT MAKES HIS UBIQUITY SO REMARKABLE IS THAT PAUL should never have been part of this story to begin with . Although he lived in the same century as Jesus and may have been in Jerusalem at the same time Jesus taught there , we have no evidence that their paths ever crossed . Before the Resurrection , that is . It could be that Paul was deliberately avoiding contact with a known sinner , as a good Pharisee should . What we know for sure is that Paul found nothing in the reports of Jesus ' words and deeds to convince him this rabbi was an agent of God . Rather , everything Paul knew about Jesus confirmed that the preacher from Galilee was a liar and blasphemer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the founder of a movement that had to be stopped . Unhappily for Paul , as for many of his contemporaries , the death of Jesus did not put an end to his movement . If anything , the horrific execution followed by rumors of a spectacular return and transfigured disciples made the memory of Jesus even more dangerous than he 'd been in person . Like those in the Sanhedrin who gave Paul papers of authority to act on their behalf , Paul was convicted by the moral imperative to seize and kill all those who spoke in " that name . " It 's hard to imagine anything that would have prevented Paul from carrying out his consecrated mission in Damascus . But along the road he ran into what must go down in salvation history as the ultimate snag : the Risen Lord himself . Jesus spoke to him as a brother , using his Jewish name , Saul , rather than his Roman street name , Paul . With this intimate address used only in the synagogue between fellow believers , Jesus asked him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROHR HAS ASTUTELY GRASPED the significance of this question for Paul . Rohr points out that Jesus did not say what Paul might have expected . Jesus did not ask , " Why are you persecuting my friends , my church ? " Jesus revealed to Paul that the violence he was committing was against Jesus himself . The identity of the church was so closely bound to the life of Jesus that they were one and the same . Never mind the part about having this conversation with a man quite some time dead . Never mind coming face to face with a person Paul imagined to be the devil incarnate and discovering him to be a glorified being . Paul never got over the implications of these words : " I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting . " Nearly everything Paul later preached and wrote about the mystical nature of the church in Christ was rooted in the overwhelming implications of this profound unity . This is how Paul , outsider and virulent denouncer of the church , was dragged to the center of it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God once drove him to destroy the Christian movement would later write urgently to his friends , " The love of Christ impels us " ( 2 Cor. 5:14 ) . Here was a man patently incapable of being a fence sitter or a cool observer of his times . Truth was n't something to which you gave your assent and then filed away under " creed . " Truth was something you plunged into up to your neck , even if it cost you your head . PAUL NEVER TRIED TO WHITEWASH HIS RESUME OR LIVE down his reputation . He incorporated the truth about himself into his message , in fact , making it a crucial part of the gospel he proclaimed : " For you heard of my former way of life . . . how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it " ( Gal . 1:13 ) . Paul was like a prisoner witnessing to his former inmates about the discovery that had set him free despite his chains . And perhaps this is what made Paul the superstar who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since : He 's one of us . He 's a person who did some terrible things for very good reasons and then had to repent and renounce them . His humility is as deep as his pride was originally wide . Seized by the truth and forced to change , he did not allow guilt and remorse to paralyze him . Rather , he permitted the forgiveness of Christ to make a new man out of him altogether and he surrendered to that amazing grace like a lover in ecstasy . Paul 's gospel was convincing precisely because he was convincing . Remember , he did n't have the advantage of toting around the written testimonies of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John in his briefcase . There was no New Testament yet- Paul was writing its first chapters with every letter dashed off to his little house churches . Therefore Pauls gospel was not a third-person narrative of a man named Jesus who did a lot of amazing things , was killed for it , and rose again . Paul made himself the medium of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurrection , and used himself as Exhibit A in the case for Christianity . " I have been crucified with Christ ; yet I live , no longer I , but Christ lives in me , " he declared with astonishing directness and conviction ( Gal . 2:19-20 ) . The word chutzpah was invented for folks like this . Few of us might have the nerve to use our own lives and examples as proof-texts for the gospel of Jesus Christ . And along with our wonder and admiration for Paul comes our own shamefaced recognition that we should not find his example so alien . What would it take for you or me to become a Christian like Paul , so aligned with Christ-life that the resemblance is unmistakable ? IT 'S WITH REAL REGRET THAT I STAND IN THE DOORWAY AT THE end of this Pauline Year , knowing that Paul wo n't be constantly at my heels , asking , telling , coaxing , and compelling . I listen to his words for the Pauline feast that closes this year : " The time of my departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have finished the race ; I have kept the faith " ( 2 Tim . 4:6-7 ) . Goodbye for now , Paul . But do n't be a stranger .
