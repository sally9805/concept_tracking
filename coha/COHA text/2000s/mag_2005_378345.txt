Nigel Parsons zips through his day like any other top media executive . He has just dispatched his programming director to visit independent production houses in London , and shortly he will hold a personnel meeting with his news director . But in ticking off the specs for his new global headquarters , Parsons illustrates why there is nothing ordinary about his job . " We 'll have an open-plan newsroom , and we hope to put in a small gym , " he explains as he surveys the building site , a former parking lot in the tiny Persian Gulf state of Qatar . After a brief pause , he adds , " And the prayer rooms  --  do n't forget the prayer rooms ! " <P> As the boss of al-Jazeera International , Parsons is creating from scratch an English-language sister channel to the controversial Arabic broadcaster best known in the West for bringing Osama bin Laden to the world 's television screens . In early 2006 , al-Jazeera 's English channel plans to start going head to head with the likes of CNN and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The channel 's budget is a closely guarded secret , as are the identities of the distributors and advertisers it is wooing , but al-Jazeera is clearly aiming high . " We think it is a fairly tired old industry , " Parsons , 53 , the son of a British army officer once stationed in the Middle East , says with a mildly cocky air . " We are quite happy to shake it up . " <P> The idea is bold . The founding of al-Jazeera International marks the first time that a broadcaster based in the developing world will transmit English news and current-affairs shows to viewers throughout the U.S. , Europe and the rest of the developed world . And there 's more to come from al-Jazeera and its fabulously petro-rich bankroller , the government of the tiny state of Qatar . The English channel is the centerpiece of a plan to transform the company into a media powerhouse with greater clout in the Middle East and far beyond . " We are expanding to become a major international media group , " al-Jazeera chairman Sheik Hamad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The market is open . Our ambition is to be among the big broadcasters of the world . " <P> It wo n't be easy , not the least because of al-Jazeera 's reputation in the West for having an anti-American , pro-Arab bias . The network may have money to expand without worrying too much about revenue from potentially skittish advertisers : Qatar 's Emir underwrites roughly 60% of the government-owned network 's estimated $85 million annual budget . But whether the English channel will be able to wrest spots on U.S. cable networks or persuade satellite services to run its programming , not to mention grab an audience , is unclear . Even Arab Americans tend to watch other cable news stations , like Fox News and CNN , instead of al-Jazeera in Arabic , which is available in the U.S. on some satellite systems .
