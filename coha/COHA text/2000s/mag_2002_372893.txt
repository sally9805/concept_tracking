Back in the dark , scary days of autumn , top law-and-order men like John Ashcroft and Tom Ridge pinned little silver sheriff 's stars to every American chest and told us to be vigilant , form neighborhood watch groups and report anything suspicious . The 911 lines promptly jammed , local cops chased flocks of wild geese , and no one felt much safer . <P> Too much information , it turns out , is sometimes not much better than too little  --  especially if the information ends up in the hands of a federal agency that does n't know what to do with it , an agency that hates embarrassment above all things . So it was extraordinary to see last week what it takes to bring an agency like the FBI to its knees , make it admit defeat and promise  --  yet again  --  to mend its ways . Minneapolis , Minn. , agent Coleen Rowley 's blistering 13-page memo , first published by TIME , detailed some warnings that had been ignored and the opportunities that were missed even when the FBI agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implored headquarters to act before something really bad happened . <P> Rowley 's memo ripped into FBI chief Robert Mueller just as he was changing the way the bureau hunts terrorists in the U.S.  --  nine months after he first made that very same promise . Mueller announced Wednesday that he was retargeting more agents at the terrorists , empowering local field agents to seize the initiative , centralizing information in Washington so that every agent would know what every other agent was doing and creating a special branch of analysts to think through every unimaginable possibility . Mueller cited Rowley 's memo and an e-mail written last summer by agent Kenneth Williams in Phoenix , Ariz. , as proof that the bureau was broken and needed repairs . " We have to develop the capability to anticipate attacks , " he said . " We have to develop the capability of looking around corners . " <P> Nobody was arguing with that , but not everyone was applauding Thursday when Attorney General Ashcroft announced that he was rewriting the rules that govern the way FBI agents launch and conduct probes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ashcroft said , would help the feds prevent terrorist strikes rather than deal with them after they happen . But lawmakers of both parties complained that Ashcroft had cast off a 26-year-old policy without giving them any notice . Civil libertarians cried that the FBI was trampling on privacy in the name of security . And even George W. Bush 's chief of staff , Andrew Card , was irked that the White House had been left out of the loop .
