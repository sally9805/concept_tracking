Ask Annie // Dear Annie : About 100 of my colleagues and I have just been notified of a change in our status at work , and I 'm wondering if there 's anything to it that we might be missing . We had been salaried employees , but now the company is classifying our jobs as hourly instead . The message we 're getting is that basically nothing will change-our current salaries will just be broken down into the hourly wage equivalent-except that we 'll have to punch a time clock and we 'll have the potential for overtime pay if it 's been approved beforehand . That sounds okay to me , but is there anything our bosses are n't telling us that we should watch out for ? - New Blue Collar Dear NBC : " Legally companies are generally free to make this change , and there 's no particular downside for the employee , " says Jonathan Sulds , an employment lawyer and partner at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &; Feld ( www.akingump.com ) . Indeed , if you often work more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay could be quite a nice thing . Sulds has just one suggestion : " Ask whether any of your current benefits-including things like profit sharing , stock plans , and options grants-will be affected . Usually when companies offer these benefits to salaried people only , and then reclassify large numbers of employees , they open up the benefits to hourly workers as well , so as not to shortchange anyone . But it never hurts to check and make sure . " While we 're on this subject , here 's a bit of background , since I 've heard from so many people who seem a bit confused-for instance , software programmers who complain that their employers have wrongly classified them as salaried to avoid paying them overtime . Federal and state wage and hour laws dictate that everyone who works 40 hours a week must be paid no less than the minimum wage ( currently $5.15 per hour ) and must earn overtime pay ( typically time and a half ) for hours exceeding the weekly 40 . Salaried workers-that group of employees you are now leaving-are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be an issue for you , the number of hours you 've been putting in could be a different story . Here 's why : According to Department of Labor guidelines for the federal Fair Labor Standards Act , only people with management , administrative , or professional duties , whose work requires " advanced knowledge " and the " exercise of discretion and independent judgment , " are supposed to be exempt-i.e. , ineligible for overtime pay . Also exempt : highly skilled computer systems analysts , programmers , software engineers , and other techies whose pay , computed hourly , exceeds $27.63 per hour , and teachers , who are given a blanket exemption . Anyone else is technically not exempt , and there are penalties for employers who deliberately misclassify people . If you and your newly blue-collar colleagues have been working way more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis without meeting the Department of Labor 's criteria for exemption , then by reclassifying you now , your company is correcting an old mistake . In that case , says Deb Keary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resource Management ( www.shrm.org ) , " you could sue for back overtime . But your employer is probably hoping you wo n't think of that . " Dear Annie : I 'm an African-American woman graduating from college in June , and my goal is to work for a company where I 'll have a real chance to be recognized for my contributions . Recruiters say their companies value diversity , but they would , would n't they ? How can I pinpoint companies that " walk the talk " ? - Slightly Skeptical Dear SS : Not to blow our own horn , but if you have n't already done so , check out FORTUNE 's list of America 's 50 Best Companies for Minorities ( www.fortune.com ) . Next , the folks at research and publishing firm DiversityInc. ( www.diversityinc.com ) suggest you ask recruiters where else they 're looking . Companies serious about diversity comb the campuses of historically black colleges and have partnerships with groups like the National Society of Hispanic MBAs . Then search the Internet for news articles on awards an employer may have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the company 's website , look for a mission statement on diversity , signed by the CEO or someone almost as high up . Such a statement does n't necessarily reflect reality , notes employment lawyer Jonathan Segal , " but the absence of one means they do n't even realize it 's an issue . " Study the annual report to see who 's running things . Is top management all white and male ? The board of directors ? Says Segal : " To be real about diversity , you have to share power . " And obviously , when you interview at the company , look around . In this as in so much else , what you see is what you get . Now , friends , I 'd like to repeat a request I made at the end of December-when it may have been overlooked in the holiday hubbub-on behalf of Dress for Success ( www.dressforsuccess.org ) , a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged women to join the workforce . The organization would like to tap into your collective wisdom . So please write and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given you before you ventured into the business world ? What advice do you have for someone just starting out ? Dress for Success will use your insights in its training materials . Many thanks !
