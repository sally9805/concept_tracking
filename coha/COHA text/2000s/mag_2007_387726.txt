Headnote Part I of a special three-part series , " The Christian History of the Constitution , " which examines the eradication of religious values from American life since our country 's founding . // AMONG HIS OTHER ODD DISTINCTIONS , Jean Jacques Rousseau might be considered the patron saint of modern historiography . He at any rate caught the spirit of it when he said , in a famous passage1 , " Let us begin by setting aside all the facts , because they do not affect the question . " This fact-free technique , used often by Rousseau , wowed the literati of Europe circa 1750 and made him the toast of Paris . It seems to have impressed a lot of other people since , as the same non-empirical method has been routinely wielded in many academic studies , from retrospectives of the Middle Ages to discussions of the Cold War . In countless books and essays , relevant facts have indeed been set aside-or baldly misstated-to support some view already held before the history writing started . In few cases has this been mo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of our republic , with particular emphasis on the War of Independence and constitutional founding that followed . The guiding concepts of these a priorist studies have been intense hostility to religion , a concomitant wish to downplay its importance , and a determined effort to write our history in keeping with such notions . The effects of this have gone beyond the realm of academic error , had as that is , to help work enormous changes in the social order . In obedience to lessons allegedly taught in these irreligious histories , archly secularist views have been imparted , and measures taken , severely wrenching the lives and customs of our people . This has in turn led to angry conflict on a host of faith-related issues-abortion , euthanasia , homosexuality , marriage-that now so painfully divide us . In legal terms , the most obvious manifestation of the problem has been a series of federal court decrees barring religious value and observance from vast sectors of American life . Bible reading and prayer in the public schools , display of the Ten Commandments . Christmas manger scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stamped out as contrary to the wishes of our Founders . The legal pretext for these rulings is that tax support for such observance violates the clause in the First Amendment prohibiting an " establishment of religion " in official practice . The locus classicus for this view is the statement of Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black in a 1947 decision . " The " establishment of religion " clause of the First Amendment . " said Black , " means at least this : Neither a state nor the Federal government can set up a church , Neither can pass laws which aid one religion , aid all religions , or prefer one religion over another .... No tax in any amount , large or small , can be levied to support any religious values or institutions , whatever they may be called , or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion . " This dictate has been enforced with increasing rigor through the years and , despite anomalies in the process , Black 's absolutist doctrine is now accepted as conventional wisdom on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as some would like , the legal watchdogs of the American Civil Liberties Union and such are ever alert to enforce its sanctions . Thus by relentless pressure are the words and symbole of traditional faith driven from our discourse . The court decrees that have produced all this are closely linked to the Rousseauvian method , as these edicts-somewhat distinctively for legal rulings-are based on a purported history of our founding . As explained in discursive comments by Justices Wiley Rutledge and David Sou ter . among others , we have to do these things because that 's the way the Founders set it up . These far-seeingstatesmen , we 're told , mandated astrict separation of church and state when they adopted the First Amendment , so we 're obliged today to banish tax support for religious doctrine . The main champions of this outlook , it 's said , were James Madison and Thomas Jefferson , who worked to disestablish Virginia 's Episcopal Church in the 1780s , then carried the battle to the national level with the First Amendment . In this telling , Jefferson , Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted a purely secular system . Banning prayer from the schools and all the rest are in alleged fulfillment of their vision . ASTONISHING AS IT MAY SEEM , given the axiomatic status of such notions , all of this is absurdly false-Rousseauvian history at its worst , running amok mid at full throttle . Un any fair examination of our country 's past , the **25;2046;TOOLONG rendition is not only wrong , but an exact inversion of the record . From the religious views and practices of the founding era , to Madison and Jefferson in Virginia , to the adoption of the First Amendment , the Court 's rulings on these matters , and the history they embody , have blithely set aside the facts to reach a pre-ordained conclusion . While the proofs of this are mam- , among the simplest ways of grasping the truth of the matter is to consult the views of leading politicians in the **28;2073;TOOLONG epoch . In this respect the obvious place to start is with George Washington , military hero of the War of Independence , presiding officer at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Far from being a secularist or skeptic . Washington throughout his public life was a staunch supporter of the view that religious piety was essential to the well-being of the country . Washington 's most notable comment to this effect-though by no means the only one-was his Farewell Address , wherein he stated that " reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle . " In the course of a long career he backed this precept with many actions , including proclamations of Thanksgiving to God and support for tax assessments to advance religious teaching . As commander of our military forces , he made diligent efforts to provide the armies with chaplains and require attendance at religious service . WASHINGTON 'S STATEMENTS on these topics , be it noted , were n't merely religious in some indefinite sense hut were expressly Christian . Among his messages to his troops , for instance , was this from 1776 : " The blessing and protection of Heaven are at all times necessary , hut especially so in times of public distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer and man will endeavor to live and act as becomes a Christian soldier , defending the dearest rights and liberties of his country . " And this from 1778 : " The commander in chief directs that Divine service be performed every Sunday at 11 o'clock , in each brigade which has a Chaplain .... While we are duly performing the duty of good soldiers , we certainly ought not to he inattentive to the higher duties of religion . To the distinguished character of a patriot , it should ht1 our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of a Christian . " All of which looks a lot like1 religious advocacy in a tax-supported setting though tax support for Washington 's armies was admittedly meager ) . Not too different from Washington 's comments were those of his successor to the nation 's highest office , John Adams of Massachusetts . Adams frequently expressed in both private and public statements the belief that political liberty required religious virtue . As he wrote to his wife Abigail in 1775 : " Statesmen may plan and speculate for liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand . A patriot mus I be a religious man . " Adams would reinforce this view in public statements when he became the country 's leader . Vide his presidential proclamation of 1798. urging lus fellow citizens to " acknowledge before God the manifold sins and transgressions with which we are justly chargeable ... beseeching Him at the same time of His infinite grace , through the Redeemer of the world , freely to remit all offenses and to incline us by His holy spirit to ... repentance and reformation . " This Trinitarian message was issued from the highest office in the land within a decade after adoption of the First Amendment . Jefferson , who followed Adams as chief executive , is much cited by the secularizers , as he held views in some respects congruent with their model . Even so , the fit is n't a very good one , as Jefferson repeatedly voiced his faith in a providential God . and likewise expressed the view that freedom depended on religion . " Can the liberties of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have removed their only firm basis , a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God ? " Or . as he put it on another occasion : " The God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time ; the hand offeree may destroy , hut can not disjoin them . " Madison , Jefferson 's political ally and successor in the White House , is likewise cited in the standard histories , as he did hold scparationist views , up to a point and with provisos . Yet he was on all the evidence not a skeptic , hut a believing Christian . He was , for instance , a protg of the Calvinist John Witherspoon at Princeton , read theology with his mentor , and maintained his interest in the subject for years thereafter . Between 1772 and 1775 , he undertook an extensive study of Scripture at Montpelier . His papers include notes on the Bible made at this period and a pocket booklet on The Necessary Duty of Family Prayer , with Prayertifor Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only because they were among the most eminent Founders , but also because they are often depicted in the standard histories as skeptics , theological liberals , or devotees of secularizing doctrine . Without pursuing that aspect here-and there is more to he said about it-suffice it to note that , if these were the liberals , we can well imagine what things were like in more orthodox circles of the era . And , indeed , if we examine some of the other Founders , we find their ranks so replete with Biblebclieving Christians as to suggest that America at the epoch of the founding was a country awash in religious fervor . Space permits only a sampling , but even a cursory survey is enough to suggest the errors in the standard version . Moving roughly North to South along the coastline , following are a few case studies . Samuel Adams of Massachusetts , the wily strategist of independence , was an old-fashioned Puritan who saw in America the makings of a " Christian Sparta " not unlike the city on a hill envisioned by his Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continental Congress of ' ' 74 in favor of having chaplains lead the group in prayer , despite denominational disagreements . As he put it : " I am not a bigot . I can hear a prayer by a man of piers ' and virtue , who is at the same time a friend of his country . " SAM ADAMS WAS NOT ONLY PURITAN but represented a state with an established , tax-supported church-one that would remain established for the next six decades . His staunchly Calvinist views were shared by others from Massachusetts , including Caleb Strong and Elbridge Gerry , both delegates to the constitutional convention and members of the Federal Congress . Things were n't very different in Connecticut-yet another Puritan state with yet another tax-supported church-where1 constitutional founders Roger Sherman and Oliver Kllsworth were mainstays of the Puritan-founded Congregational Church , and served in Congress also . Sherman . one of the most important but also most neglected of the Founders , was as much an oldfangled Puritan as Sam Adams . He objected to traveling on Sunday , was a leader in the ecclesiastical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even while tending to his worldly obligations . One of his writings is entitled , A Short Sermon on the Duty of Self-Examination Preparatory to Receiving the Lord 's Supper . He would later play a pivotal role in shaping the religion clauses of the First Amendment . New York State was more heterodox than New England , but even here the religious com-ictions and activities of the I'oundinggeneratkm were impressive . John Jay , co-author of The Federalist and later Chief Justice under the Constitution , was a devout evangelical Christian of Huguenot extraction . Hufus King , formerly of Massachusetts , would become warden of New York City 's Trinity Church . The formidable Alexander Hamilton-often depicted as a skeptic-was another believing Christian who would prove his faith in dramatic fashion . Next door in New Jersey , religious zeal burned more hotly still , as this was the home of Witherspoon. a one-man Christian Coalition . A Presbyterian divine from Scotland . Witherspoon was not only an influential preacher , but a member of the Continental Congress and signer of the Declaration of Independence . He was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders were his students , and which at the era of the founding was a stronghold of Calvinist Christianity . Less acclaimed than Withcrspoon , hut known finpiety also , was his New Jersey colleague Elias Boudinot. ; i leader in the Continental Congress and in the new Congress under the Constitution . It was Houdinot who , in September 1789. moved that Congress go on the record " in returning to Almighty God their sincere thanks for the many blessings He poured down upon them . " This resulted in an overwhelming vote in favor of a day of prayer and Thanksgivingpassed the day after the T louse approved the language of the First Amendment . In Pennsylvania ( and Delaware ) , the learned John Dickinson . pamphleteer of America 's cause in its legal contests with Great Britain , was a devout Quaker , and in 1781 would deliver a tough official message warning against the threat of creeping irreligion . Upon retirement from public life , he pursued intensive biblical studies , with particular focus on the Book of Matthew . His Pennsylvania colleague James Wilson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another evangelical Christian , who opined that the " will of God " was the supreme law of nations . Benjamin Rush , the surgeon general of the revolution , was a stalwart Calvinist who believed " the Bible must be the center of education . " In Maryland , there was small ehance that irreligion would flourish , as this was the refuge of America 's then small band of Catholics . Foremost among these was the remarkable Carroll family-Archbishop John , signer of the Declaration Charles , and constitutional delegate Daniel . The two political Carrolls. like others mentioned , were members of the Congress that approved the First Amendment . Moving southward to Virginia , we find still other staunch religionists holding office . Though portrayed in many histories as a hotbed of irreligion-and there had been instances in the earlier going among the Cavalier squirearchy-the Old Dominion in the late 18th century was Ground Zero for religious fervor . This resulted from the so-called Great Awakening led by the Presbyterian Samuel Davies and the Baptists captained by John Leland . Patrick Henry was , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Virginians such as Edmund Fcndleton . Richard Bland , and Kdmund Randolph were likewise known for their devotion to religious causes . Such examples might be multiplied indefinitely . but a few other instances may be briefly cited by way of wrap-up . Looking strictly at tie-legates to the constitutional convention , we note that David Brearly of New Jersey was a delegate to the Episcopal Convention of 1786 ; Richard Bassett of Delaware , a strong supporter of Methodist Bishop Francis Ashury ; Hugh Williamson of North Carolina , a former Presbyterian preacher : Charles Coteswurth Pinckney of South Carolina , the longtime president of the Charleston Bible Society ; and William Few of Georgia , " a staunch believer in revealed religion " - to cite only a handful from a considerable roster . OF COURSE , no such discussion can omit the case of Benjamin Franklin , with Jefferson the quintessential American enlightenment figure , and likeJefferson a Unitarian in doctrine . Vet it was Franklin who at the Constitutional Convention called for prayer to aid the dnifters in their efforts , saying that , the longer he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the affairs of men . " Cynics have suggested that the old philosopher was showboating , as he sometimes did . but his private papers tell us he was sincere in this avowal. reflecting as his personal credo that " there is one God who made all things . " who " governs the world by his providence . " and who was to be adored and worshiped . Ironically , Franklin 's motion was opposed by Hamilton , objecting that a sudden resort to prayer might suggest things were going badly . This has led some secularizers to conclude Hamilton was the skeptic-the " least religious of the founders . " in one version . Yet as a youthful member of the Continental Army . we 're told , he was known for religious devotion , and as a mature politician , sought to found a " Christian constitutional society " in " support of the Christian religion . " Most tellingly , in the fatal duel with Burr , as Hamilton wrote beforehand , he resolved not to tire his weapon . " as the scruples of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any extent rather than subject myself to the guilt of taking the life of another . " If Hamilton was the " least religious " of the Founders , what does this say about the rest ? And . more to the point of the larger history , what 's the likelihood that people holding such opinions would have decided to ban religion from the conduct of the nation 's business ? As may be shown in some detail , the secular history in this respect is still more mistaken than in its casual disregard of fact in treatments of the individual Founders . Sidebar Jefferson , who followed Adams as chief executive , is much cited by the seculanzers , as he held views in some respects congruent with their model .
