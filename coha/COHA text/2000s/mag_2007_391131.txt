Q CAN RIDING ROLLER COASTERS TOO OFTEN BE BAD FOR MY HEALTH ? A Not if you 're healthy to begin with . The forces generated by a coaster can equal those of a fighter-jet takeoff or shuttle launch , which can prevent blood from reaching the brain and lead to blackouts . But on amusement rides , this force rarely lasts longer than three seconds ; even with multiple loop-de-loops , that 's safe . No serious long-term risks have been associated with frequent riding , and most experts agree that your main concerns should be temporarily cramped muscles and head and neck aches . You might experience some irritation from the rides ' restraints  --  lap bars can leave bruises , and shoulder harnesses have been known to cause " nipple burn . " And it can take a while for your inner ear to return to normal after the prolonged twisting and turning , so you may feel off-balance for up to a few days , says John Gerard , a San Diego physician and member of the American Coaster Enthusiasts . Perhaps the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been riding roller coasters for hours at a time for 30 years .

" Sometimes I have to push my right hand open with my left . " We caught up with Rodriguez in August , three days after he set the Guinness world record for continuous time on a coaster : 401 straight hours ( that 's 16 days , 17 hours ) set in Blackpool , England . " My balance has been a little off and I 've wanted to lie down a lot , but I always bounce back quickly , " he reported . " I 'm still peeling a bit from the windburn  --  I look like I spent a week at the beach . " All the screaming kids on the coaster did cause him frequent headaches ( he 's fine now ) , but at least he managed to escape the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making ethanol : corn or sugarcane ? A At a glance , corn appears to be the more energetic crop : One ton of corn yields 100 gallons of ethanol , whereas one ton of sugarcane creates only 20 gallons . But sugarcane grows in denser clumps than corn , so one acre of sugarcane produces at least 590 gallons of ethanol , as opposed to just 400 gallons of ethanol per acre of corn . Converting sugarcane to ethanol is also more environmentally friendly , says Jose Goldemberg , a Brazilian physicist and secretary for the environment for the state of Sao Paulo . Distillers in Brazil , the world 's largest producer of ethanol , get eight gallons of sugarcane ethanol from just one gallon of fossil fuel . Corn , the primary source of ethanol in the U.S. , yields only two gallons of ethanol per gallon of fossil fuel . So why does the U.S. , the world 's second-largest ethanol producer , prefer corn ? The answer is economic and political . Brazil has the right climate for sugarcane and lots of cheap labor . Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethanol demand is n't as high in the U.S. as it is in Brazil , so American farmers make more money growing cane for sugar rather than fuel . Still , even converting the entire U.S. corn crop into ethanol would satisfy only one fifth of our fuel needs and leave no corn for animal feedstock and barbeques . A better solution , says Gregory McRae , a professor of chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , could come from cellulosic conversion technology , which uses enzymes or other chemicals to break down the tough plant fibers in corn husks , grasses and even trees to unlock the additional energy stored in it . Scientists have yet to identify enzymes that can perform this task cheaply and efficiently , though . " It 's pretty easy to eat the corn , " McRae says , " but chewing through the cob is tough .

Columbia University Press ; $23 BOX ASK AN EXTREME-SPORTS PHYSICIST JAMES RIORDON : Is it possible to do more than two backflips on a motorcyle ? My son and I are huge fans of freestyle motocross superstar Travis Pastrana , and after he pulled off the first-ever double backflip in the 2006 X Games , we wondered how many more flips he might be able to do . These guys push the limits , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backflips one can do on a motocross bike . So I applied some Newtonian physics to the trick to figure it out . The average rider and bike together weigh about 330 pounds , and the highest they can jump ( without flipping ) is about 36 feet . But it takes energy to rotate the bike , which a rider pays for in lost height . I did some calculus to figure out the best way to budget the rider 's energy between jumping and rotating , and it turns out that a 50-50 split is best . This means that the rider will launch 18 feet high and will be airborne for 2.12 seconds . In this amount of time , spinning at 1.67 rotations per second , there 's no way for anyone to do more than four backflips . Remember , though , that this is the absolute limit on these bikes . If the rider rotates only , say , three and a quarter times , he 's going to crush his front fork and end up in the hospital . That said , Travis : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foam landing pit first .
