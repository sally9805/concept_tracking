MY DRESS ! Graham ( left ) and Bledel match wits ( and outfits ) on Girls // GILMORE GIRLS THE WB. 8-9 PM DEBUTS OCT. 5 The funky family drama GILMORE GIRLS nudges The WB beyond its teen horizons and takes on Friends with its thoroughly modern mother-daughter act ON THE L.A. SET OF THE WB 'S GILMORE GIRLS , THE titular twosome-Rory and Lorelai-are having a good old-fashioned mother-daughter spat . Rory 's swamped with - cw ork , but Lorelai keeps bugging her to take an ice cream break . Finally , Roy erupts : " Lm-elai , go to Your room ! " 0 It sounds like vour average family th.une ( ly scene , except for one thing : Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) is a serious-minded lti-year-old prep schooler , and Loreli ( Lauren Graham ) is her free-spirited : 332-year-old single mother . Do the math , and you 'll figure out this is not your stereotYpical American TV elan . " lGi ) ; ' ' ( sl strength is that it 's a family show that does not pander or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) . " It 's not so soft that your grandmother could watch it with her dentures out . " In other words , " it 's not going to be 7th Heaven , " declares Gilmore creator Amy Sherman-Palladino ( Roseanne ) . What sets the show apart are its sardonic one-liners ( " On the way home , you can pull a Menendez , " Lorelai tells Rory before dragging her to dinner at her stuffy grandparents ' house ) , its multicultural cast ( Lorelai manages a hotel in the diverse fictional hamlet of Stars Hollow , Conn. ) , and unusually close familial bonding ( Rory and Lorelai share the same taste in lip gloss and Macy Gray CDs ) . Yet Sherman-Palladino can thank shows like Heaven for helping get her series on the air . As that 991/ percent pure drama started cleaning up in the ratings , a group of advertisers ( including Procter &; Gamble and Johnson &; Johnson ) formed the Family Friendly Programming Forum to fund the development of similar series . When Graham learned Gilmore was supported by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so nervous .... I would be more comfortable if it were called the Dysfunctional Family Friendly Forum . " Not to worry : Despite its ominous moniker , the FFPF has no political agenda . " It 's not a right-wing thing , " says Graham .. " It 's mainly supporting shows with a multigenerational element that you could watch as a family . " Sounds good , but up against NBC 's Friends , will there be any families left to watch Gilmore ? " People really like those six kids , " Sherman-Palladino says , adding tartly " Well , they 're not kids anymorethey 're all , like , 80 . " Still , " there probably is n't a tougher time slot , " WB Entertainment president Susanne Daniels concedes . " But in a strange way , that 's a vote of confidence from us . " If the show can overcome this potentially crippling " vote of confidence " and attract a small , loyal cult the way Popular did in the same spot last season , Daniels promises Gilmore wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to switch from UPN 's WWF Smackdown ! to watch something with the far less macho title of Gilmore Girls . " It 's not just a chick show , " insists ShermanPalladino . " There are funny , interesting characters .. and I 'm adding a couple more guys . " Offers Bledel ( an 18-year-old model making her TV debut ) , " Guys are interested in girls , so maybe they 'll check it out . " And while Graham agrees that the name may turn off a few males , she prefers it to an alternative she 's heard : " One title that has been flown is The Gilmore Way , which sounds like a method of natural childbirth . I 'm not behind that . " Besides , the actress is convinced that men will eventually come around . " That 's why my shorts will be very short , " she quips . Even though she 's playing a TV mom , " this will be the sexiest character I 've ever gotten to do , ironically , " says Graham , who nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom " on the set , it sent a chill down my spine that I ca n't say was pleasant . " More appealing for The WB is the prospect of Gilmore attracting a few moms along with their daughters . The network learned the hard way last season that you ca n't survive on high school shows alone , as its youth-appeal-heavy schedule helped drag it down from fifth to sixth behind UPN in overall ratings . " They really saturated the teen market , " says Sherman-Palladino . " Last year some good shows went down because people were like , Ugh , another show about teens-who cares ? " ' That 's why Gilmore will deal as much with Stars Hollows quirky residents as with Rory 's adolescent travails . " School 's a place we 've all seen before , and this town is n't , " says The WB 's Daniels . Adds Graham : " I do n't think there are that many high school stories left to be told . The focus of this show is the family and their relationships . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's words , " two unbelievably beautiful women , " all the better . While Graham is n't gunning for the Sexiest Mom on TV title ( " Sela Ward has that one " ) , she has been indoctrinated into the ways of The WB Women : " I 've already gotten the briefing : Do n't cut your hair , and be prepared to wear only a bra at any time .
