Six-month-old Cassandra loves to touch things . " She rubs her hands over every surface - in fact , right now she 's sitting in her high chair with one arm reaching back to feel the plasticky upholstery , " says her mom , Stephanie Wood . Cassandra also likes to touch the nubby texture of the throw cushions on the couch and the rug , and the smooth crib sheets . " I give her lots of toys with different textures , but she 's really more interested in the real stuff . She 's learning about the wider world through her hands , " says Wood . " And about two weeks ago , I noticed that she was able to transfer an object from one hand to the other . " Cassandra is right on track when it comes to fine motor development - the ability to use the fingers , hands and wrists , says Vancouver paediatric occupational therapist Ronit Kabazo . Read on for a grasp of hand development milestones and how to encourage your baby 's growing dexterity . The hands open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers 80 to 90 percent of the time , says Kabazo . Over the next three months , those tiny fingers will unfurl . Hand movements are general and not purposeful at first : Tiny babies do n't know that their hands belong to them . Gradually , those random movements become more organized . Wood says she noticed how , at about two months , Cassandra started to look intently at her hands . " You could tell she was beginning to recognize that they were hers . " Right from birth , if you put your finger into baby 's palm , she 'll hold on . This grasp reflex lasts for several months . Gradually , though , more purposeful grasping develops , along with the ability to see and be interested in an object . Young babies enjoy having a mobile so they can bat at dangling toys . Try putting things in your baby 's hands - blocks , rattles , your finger , says Kabazo . " The palm provides baby with a lot of sensory information . " Grasping and raking By four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will begin to be able to hold onto an object for a few seconds . Putting objects to the mouth is a sign of healthy , normal development , says Kabazo . At this stage , babies are also able to clasp their hands together , and hold onto a soft toy with both hands along the midline of the body . " Cassandra loves her toes , " says her mom . " We leave her socks off whenever it 's warm enough because she 'll grab and pull them off anyway , and she really enjoys grabbing her toes when it 's bath time . " Tummy time is now a bigger part of your baby 's life . With the ability to hold up her head and support her weight on her hands and arms , she will begin to push with her hands and roll over . By six months , the fingers operate as a unit and babies typically rake objects toward themselves . If she 's holding a toy in one hand , she may pat it with the other .

Holding on and letting go Between six and nine months , your baby has a lot more control over his hands as he learns to use his fingers more effectively . He 's beginning to hold on and let go , bang objects together or on the floor , and throw things . He is also gaining the ability to use his hands independently - perhaps holding a rattle in one hand and reaching for a block with the other . " Now that baby is sitting with more stability , he can do more things with his hands , " says Kabazo . Wood says one of the best toy buys she 's made is a shape sorter . " Cassandra has n't figured out how to put the blocks through the sorter , but she loves to fill the bucket with them and then dump them out , " says Wood . " And while she does n't wave goodbye yet , she does extend her arm so that I can wave her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll likely see your baby perfecting the pincer grasp , the ability to pick up small objects using the thumb and index finger . Of course , the best place to practise this ability is during mealtimes . Picking up raisins , cereal and small pieces of cut-up fruit gives babies lots of practice using the pincer grip . A word of caution : The ability to pick up small objects and the propensity to put everything in their mouths demands careful babyproof ing . Small non-edible objects within baby 's grasp are a choking hazard .
