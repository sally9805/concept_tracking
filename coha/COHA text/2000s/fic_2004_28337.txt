The Imperial Star Destroyer moved silently through the blackness of space , its lights dimmed , its huge sublight engines blazing with the urgency of its mission . The man standing on the command walkway could feel the rumble of those engines through his boots as he listened to the muttered conversation from the crew pits below him . The conversation sounded worried , too , as worried as he himself felt . Though for entirely different reasons . For him , this was a personal matter , the frustration of a professional dealing with fallible beings and the capriciousness of a universe that refused to always live up to one 's preconceived notions as to what was fitting and proper . An error had been made , possibly a very serious error . And as with all errors , there would likely be unpleasant consequences riding in its wake . From the starboard crew pit came a muffled curse , and he stifled a grimace . None of that mattered to the Star Destroyer 's crew . Their worries stemmed solely from their performance , and whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boot in the rear at journey 's end . Or possibly they were merely worried about the sublight engines blowing up . On this ship , one never knew . He shifted his attention downward , his gaze leaving the grandeur of the starscape and coming to rest on the bow of the Star Destroyer stretching out more than a kilometer in front of him . He could remember the days when the mere sight of one of these ships would send shivers up the spines of the bravest of fighters and the most arrogant of smugglers . But those days were gone , hopefully forever . The Empire had been rehabilitated , though of course manywithin the New Republic still refused to believe that . Under Supreme Commander Pellaeon 's firm guidance , the Empire had signed a treaty with the New Republic , and was no longer any more threatening than the Bothans or the Corporate Sector or anyone else . Almost unwillingly , he smiled as he gazed along the Star Destroyer 's long prow . Of course , even in the old days of the Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fear . It was , after all , hard to take a bright red Star Destroyer very seriously . From behind him , audible even over the rumble of the engines , came the sound of clumping boots . " Okay , Karrde , " Booster Terrik grunted as he came to a halt at his side . " The comm 's finally fixed . You can transmit whenever you want . " " Thank you , " Talon Karrde said , turning back toward the crew pits and trying hard not to blame Booster for the state his equipment was in . An Imperial Star Destroyer was a huge amount of ship to take care of , and Booster never had nearly enough personnel to do the job right . " H'sishi ? " he called . " Go . " Yes , Chieftain , the Togorian called back from the comm board , her fur fluffing slightly as her clawed fingers touched the keys . Transmission complete . Shall I begin alerting the rest of the network now ? " Yes , " Karrde said . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board . With that , Karrde knew , he 'd done all he could for the moment . Turning again to face the stars , he folded his arms across his chest and tried hard to cultivate his patience . " It 'll be all right , " Booster murmured from beside him . " We 'll be around this star in half an hour and be able to jump to lightspeed . We can be in the Domgrin system in two standard days , tops . " " Assuming the hyperdrive does n't break down again . " Karrde waved a hand . " Sorry . I 'm justyou understand . " " Sure , " Booster said . " But relax , all right ? This is Luke and Mara we 're talking about , not some fresh-hatched Neimoidian grubs . Whatever 's going on , they 're not going to be caught flat-footed . " " Maybe , " Karrde said . " Though even Jedi can be surprised . " He shook his head . " But that 's not the point , is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it when that happens . " Booster shrugged his massive shoulders . " Like any of the rest of us do ? " he asked pointedly . " You have to face the facts , Karrde , and Fact Number One is that you simply ca n't know everyone who works for you anymore . " Karrde glared out at the mockingly cheerful red ship stretched out in front of him . But Booster was right . This whole thing had gotten completely out of hand . He 'd started out modestly enough , merely offering to provide timely information to the leaders of the New Republic and Empire so that both sides could be assured that the other was n't plotting against them . And for the first couple of years everything had gone just fine . The trouble had come when the various planetary and sector governments within the New Republic had woken up to the benefits of this handy service and decided they wanted aboard , too . After the near civil war that had broken out over the Caamas Document , Karrde had n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clients on Coruscant and Bastion he 'd gone ahead and expanded his operations . Which naturally meant expanding his personnel as well . In retrospect , he supposed , it had only been a matter of time before something like this happened . He just wished it had n't happened to Luke and Mara . " Maybe not , " he told Booster . " But even if I ca n't handle everything personally , it 's still my responsibility . " " Ah , " Booster said knowingly . " So it 's your pride that 's hurt , is it ? " Karrde eyed his old friend . " Tell me , Booster . Has anyone ever told you you 're truly irritating when you try to be sympathetic ? " " Yeah , the subject 's come up once or twice , " Booster said , grinning . He slapped Karrde 's back . " Come on . Let 's go down to the Transis Corridor and I 'll buy you a drink . " " Assuming the drink dispensers are working today , " Karrde murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , yeah , " Booster conceded . " Always assuming that . " ... As cantinas went , Mara Jade Skywalker thought as she sipped her drink , this was definitely one of the strangest she 'd ever been in . Part of that might simply have been due to the locale . Here in the Outer Rim , culture and style were n't exactly up to the standards of Coruscant and the rest of the Core Worlds . That might explain the gaudy wall hangings juxtaposed with ancient plumbing woven around modern drink dispensers , all of it set against a background decor consisting mainly of polished droid parts dating back to before the Clone Wars . As for the unbreakable mugs and the heavy , stone-topped table she was seated at , the smoothed-over blaster scars in the walls and ceiling were more than enough explanation . When the patrons dived under the tables in the middle of a firefight , they would want those tables to afford them some protection . And they would n't want to find themselves sitting on bits of broken crockery , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the very loud , very off-key music . A brush of air touched her shoulder , and a heavyset man appeared from behind her , pushing his way through the milling crowd . " Sorry , " he huffed as he circled the table and landed his bulk back in the seat across from her . " Business , business , business . Never lets up for a minute . " " I suppose not , " Mara agreed . He did n't fool her for a second ; even without Force sensitivity she would have spotted the furtiveness hidden behind the noise and bustle . Jerf Huxley , master smuggler and minor terror of the Outer Rim , was up to something unpleasant . The only question was how unpleasant he was planning for that something to be . " Yeah , it 's crazy out here , " Huxley went on , taking a noisy swallow of the drink he 'd left behind when he hurried off on the mysterious errand that had taken him away from their table . " ' Course , you know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He eyed her over the rim of his mug . " What 's so funny ? " " Oh , nothing , " Mara said , not bothering to erase the smile that had caught the other 's attention . " I was just thinking about what a trusting person you are . " " What do you mean ? " he asked , frowning . " Your drink , " Mara said , gesturing to his mug . " You go away and leave it alone with me , and then you just come back and toss it down without even wondering if I 've put something in it . " Huxley 's lips puckered , and through the Force Mara caught a hint of his chagrin . He had n't worried about his drink , of course , because he 'd had her under close surveillance the whole time he was gone . He also had n't intended for her to know that . " All right , fine , " he said , banging the mug back onto the table . " Enough with the games . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a man like this , Mara knew , there was no point in glaze- coating it . " I 'm here on behalf of Talon Karrde , " she said . " He wanted me to thank you for your assistance and that of your organization over the past ten years , and to inform you that your services will no longer be required . " Huxley 's face did n't even twitch . Clearly , he 'd already suspected this was coming . " Starting when ? " he asked . " Starting now , " Mara said . " Thanks for the drink , and I 'll be on my way . " " Not so fast , " Huxley said , lifting a hand . Mara froze halfway to her feet . Behind Huxley , blasters had abruptly appeared in the hands of three of the men who had hitherto been minding their own business at the bar . Blasters that were , not surprisingly , pointed at her . " Sit down , " he ordered . Carefully , Mara eased back into her chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Huxley gestured again , more emphatically this time , and the off-key background music shut off . As did all conversation . " So that 's it , is it ? " Huxley demanded quietly . In the sudden silence , even a soft voice seemed to ring against the battered walls . " Karrde 's going to toss us aside , just like that ? " " I presume you read the news , " Mara said , keeping her voice calm . All around her , she could sense the single-minded animosity of the crowd . Huxley had apparently stocked the place with his friends and associates . " Karrde 's getting out of the smuggling business . Has been , for the past three years . He does n't need your services anymore . " " Yeah , he does n't need , " Huxley said with a sniff . " What about what we need ? " " I do n't know , " Mara said . " What do you need ? " " Maybe you do n't remember what it 's like in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the table toward her . " But out here , you do n't split things three ways against the ends . You work for one group , period , or you do n't work at all . We burned our skyarches behind us years ago when we started working for Karrde . If he pulls out , what are we supposed to do ? " " I expect you 'll have to make new arrangements , " Mara said . " Look , you had to have known this was coming . Karrde 's made no secret of the direction he 's been taking . " " Yeah , right , " Huxley said contemptuously . " Like anyone believed he 'd really go straight . " He drew himself up . " So you want to know what we need ? Fine . What we need is something to tide us over until we can get back in the business with someone else . " So there it was : a simple and straightforward pocket-shake . Nothing subtle from this bunch . " How much ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly . " In cash credits . " Mara kept her face expressionless . She 'd come here prepared for something like this , but that number was way beyond reason . " And where exactly do you expect me to get this little tide-me-over ? " she asked . " I do n't carry that much spending money on me . " " Do n't get cute , " Huxley growled . " You know as well as I do that Karrde 's got a sector clearinghouse over on Gonmore . They 'll have all the credits there we need . " He dug into a pocket and produced a hold-out blaster . " You 're going to call and tell them to bring it to us , " he said , leveling the weapon at her face across the table . " Half a million . Now . " " Really . " Casually , keeping her hands visible , Mara turned her head to look behind her . Most of the cantina 's nonsmuggler patrons had already made a quiet exit , she noted , or else had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying well out of the potential lines of fire . Of more immediate concern was the group of about twenty humans and aliens who had spread themselves out in a semicircle directly behind her , all of them with weapons trained on her back . All of them also showing varying degrees of wariness , she noted with a certain malicious amusement . Her reputation had apparently preceded her . " You throw an interesting party , Huxley , " she said , turning back to face the smuggler chief . " But you do n't really think you 're equipped to deal with a Jedi , do you ? " Huxley smiled . A very evil smile . A surprisingly evil smile , actually , given the circumstances . " Matter of fact , yeah , I do . " He raised his voice . " Bats ? "
