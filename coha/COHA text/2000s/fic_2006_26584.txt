He was introduced to me as " Reddy "  --  short for Ryan Edward Millbanks III . And I should have known better . He was younger . Too young . Sexy . Too sexy . Dead sexy . Exquisite manners . And as he leaned in , kissing me lightly on the cheek , I nearly fainted from the pheromones the man emitted . " I 've heard so much about you from your ex-husband , " he whispered , his mustache tickling my ear . Alarms should have gone off . Sirens , blinking lights . Robotic voices should have warned me away . But the band was playing something Gershwinish , and I would n't have listened anyway . I only heard what I wanted to hear . At the mention of my ex , I looked around the tightly packed ballroom with alarm . " Richard ? What 's Richard doing here ? They were supposed to notify me when he was released . " Reddy looked confused and laughed to cover up his embarrassment . " Richard ? But . . . Sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you were his ex-wife . That is , he pointed in this direction and suggested I come talk to you . In fact , he suggested you might need rescuing from your date . You are BeBe Loudermilk , have I got that right ? " Now it was my turn to laugh . " Oh , Sandy . Yes , you 've got that right . Sandy is my ex . Or I 'm his . Twice , in fact . Sorry , I 've been drinkingwine all night . As for my date , I 'm not sure he remembers he brought me . " I grimaced in the direction of Tater Love , my so-called date , who 'd spent most of the evening drooling down the front of my ball gown , and who was now draped over the bar , consuming one beer after another . Tater was a last-minute fix-up , and I should have known better , but it was the Telfair Ball , which was the social event of the year in Savannah , and I 'd already paid for the tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Emery Cooper , would be joining me . Emery , one of the Cooper-Hale Mortuary Coopers , had called long distance , the previous week , to let me know that he and his ex-wife were on their way to Jamaica , to be remarried on the beach , which was the site of their first wedding . And their second honeymoon . I thought I handled the news rather well . I took the salmon steaks I 'd bought for our dinner that evening , drove over to his town house on Lafayette Square , and slid them through the mail slot in the door . That way , when Emery and his new bride returned home in a week , they 'd have something to remember me by . There was no way I was going to skip the Telfair Ball . For one thing , I was on the host committee . For another , by now , everybody in town knew that Emery had thrown me over for Cissy Drobish , the bucktoothed millionairess mother of his three children . It would n't do to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to talk , by God , they could just do it to my face . " Hold your head up high , girl , " I could hear my late father saying to me , nudging me as I slumped down in the pew in church . So I did as I was taught . I 'd spent the whole day of the ball getting ready for battle : manicure , pedicure , facial , herbal massage , and new honey-blond highlights in my hair . I 'd gotten all my big-girl jewelry out of the safe-deposit box , and had Roi , my hairdresser , pile my hair on top of my head so everybody could see that I had n't returned Emery 's diamond earrings . However fabulous I looked , however , did not change the fact that I was stuck for the evening with Tater Love , friend of a friend of a friend , confirmed bachelor , who 'd been too cheap to rent the evening shoes to go with his tux . Scuffed-black-loafer Tater Love . **32;183;TOOLONG Tater Love . It was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd decided to anesthetize myself with chardonnay as soon as we arrived at the dance . Reddy took my elbow and guided me firmly from the dance floor to a remote corner of the ballroom occupied only by a grotesque marble statue of an unidentified Greek goddess and a large potted palm . " About my exes  --  " I started to explain . " Shhh , " Reddy said , putting a finger to my lips . " Be right back , " he promised . And when he reappeared , he had a plate of lobster in one hand and a pair of crystal flutes in the other . He lifted the front of his dinner jacket  --  it looked Armani , but I could n't be sure  --  and extracted an unopened bottle of Mot &; Chandon from the waistband of his trousers . Which should have signaled another set of alarms  --  beware of men bearing gifts in their pants . He popped the champagne cork with one smooth , expert motion  --  I was soon to learn that he was an expert on many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Reddy clinked his flute lightly against mine . " To new beginnings , " he said , and he smiled that rogue smile . And that was the end of all my good intentions .
