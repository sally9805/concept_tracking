// There is no shortage of good information about dieting and exercise . What we do have is a shortage of good questions . Most questions contain unstated assumptions that completely skew the nature of the answer ( and the usefulness of the information you wind up getting ) . Most diet books jump right in and try to answer those commonly asked questions without ever questioning the assumptions the questions are based on . Here 's an example : Let 's say I 'm an explorer going off into the New World around the time of Columbus . I consult with the top navigational experts of the day in hopes that they can answer this question , " What 's the best route to take to avoid falling off the edge of the world ? " You can see immediately that the nature of the question itself forces a kind of answer that ultimately wo n't be very useful . Why ? Because both the question and the answer are based on the premise that the world is flat . See if you can find the underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cholesterol ? How can I reduce the fat in my diet ? How many calories do I burn on the exercise bike ? How many calories should I eat ? How can I get 1,500 mg a day of calcium ? The above questions may seem eminently reasonable to you because the assumptions that underlie them are so widely accepted as truth . But as we 'll see , lowering cholesterol by itself does n't necessarily lower risk for heart disease . Not everyone needs to be on a low-fat diet ( and the kind of fat you eat is way more important than the amount ) . How many calories you burn during a given exercise session may not be the most important factor in losing weight ( building muscle is far more important ) . And there 's a lot more to bone health than just calcium intake ( such as reducing the calcium robbers in our diet like sugar and getting the proper amounts of supporting minerals , like magnesium ) . So to get good information  --  and by good " I mean useful to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I used to do the following demonstration with my personal training students . I 'd ask them how they would answer a client who just asked them , " What 's the best exercise for the chest ? " Several hands would go up , each suggesting a different exercise and making a case for why it was " the best . " I would listen to their answers and then tell them that if I were the client , I 'd fire them . Can you guess why ? Because the question ca n't be answered property without first asking another question : " For whom and for what purpose ? " The best exercise for the chest is going to be very different if you 're a professional bodybuilder one week away from a big contest or if you 're Mrs. Jones who has never worked out before and wants to build enough upper body strength to open a jar . If you do n't establish who it is you 're talking about , any answer to the question is not only premature , but downright useless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , " What 's the best medicine ? " without asking a few questions of his own ? Like " Best medicine for what ? " A cold ? Arthritis ? Diabetes ? HIV ? A sinus infection ? What stockbroker worth his commission would answer the question , " What 's the best stock to buy ? " without first questioning the client about his/her financial needs , tolerance for risk , liquidity and the like ? As I 've said before , a program that teaches you what to do but does n't help you to actually do it is not very useful . However , a program that answers the wrong questions is not very useful either . The Shape Up program is going to start you off with the right information-or at least show you how to find it for yourself-so that you can spend the rest of our time together developing effective strategies for putting that information into action . So in the spirit of clearing a path toward better information , let 's begin by emptying our teacups of one of the biggest misconceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why The Food Pyramid Is Bad For Your Health I 'm often asked , " What 's wrong with the food pyramid ? " Well , off the record , just between us , I usually answer that questions with one word : everything . The USDA food pyramid , the current version of which was published in 1992 , is " committee-think " and in this case the committee is composed of representatives from the food industry plus the most entrenched and conservative factors of academic nutrition and medicine . As Robert Crayhon says , " It is a product of both expert lobbying and medical science . " Amen . It 's the government 's second try at coming up with a general template that they recommend for everyone ( anyone remember the four good groups ? ) and it undoubtedly wo n't be their last . You , however , do n't have to wait till they finally figure out what 's wrong with it to throw it out . Here are the top eight things that are wrong with the USDA food pyramid . 1 The food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs the same foods and that there is one healthy diet that works for everyone . You 've already learned to raise an eyebrow when you hear that bit of conventional wisdom , which is neither conventional nor wise . Hopefully you 'll be raising that eyebrow ever higher by the time you finish the program . Furthermore , the diet the committee chose to anoint as the one and only healthy way to eat is the familiar low-fat , high-carbohydrate diet that has caused such problems for virtually everyone for whom weight has been a lifelong struggle . The bottom line : One size does n't fit all and even if it did , it probably would n't be this size . 2 The food pyramid encourages you to think that fats are the " bad guy . " If there 's one concept that 's been wholesaled to us as a nation , it 's the idea that it is healthy to reduce fat intake to as low as possible . Making a case against this concept often causes people to look at you as if you just said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your teeth but nonetheless , the concept of wholesale fat avoidance is utterly wrong-headed . There are different kinds of fats and many of them are downright necessary for good health . Fats are the raw materials of many substances that are critical for human health , including eicosanoids , hormones and yes , cholesterol ( without which you could n't live ) . // The Food Guide Pyramid A Guide to Day Food Choices // Interestingly , eating some fats may even help you lose fat . Ann Louise Gittleman , formerly the nutrition director for the ultra-low-fat Pritikin Center and a 11 reformed " low-fat advocate , reports that she now adds essential fatty acids to the diets of many previously " fat-free " women who were stuck at a weight plateau and that the addition of these healthy fats has jumpstarted their weight loss . The food pyramid makes no distinction among the different kinds of fats , just as it does n't distinguish among the different kinds of carbohydrates ( see No. 4 ) . Fact is , the fats found in cold water fish , nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances you can possibly eat . Even some members of the universally demonized saturated fat group may have health benefits . Lauric acid , for example , found in butter and coconut , is antiviral and some traditional fats like butter ( far , far better for you than margarine ) are an unsurpassed source of vitamin A. 3 The food pyramid lumps fats and sugars together . The food pyramid demonizes both fats and sugars and tells you to eat both sparingly . As you are discovering , fats and sugars are very different animals and have very different effects on the body . Some fats should be increased ( see above ) ; nearly all sugars should be decreased as much as possible . Basic sugar is not only non-nutritive , it 's anti-nutritive . Here 's why . When sugar is found in real-life foods and plants like sugar cane , for example , it contains the vitamins , minerals and enzymes needed for its complete digestion . When it is found in your sugar bowl it contains none of these and actually has to " borrow " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to process it . That 's why many nutritionists consider sugar to be an immune system depressor . It literally steals from the nutrient stores your body needs to stay healthy in order to metabolize it . Furthermore , there 's a school of thought that believes many of us are " sugar sensitive , " meaning we react very badly to sugar of any kind . Sugar has demonstrated abilities to modulate pain thresholds and acts in your brain much like an endorphin . For this reason the concept of sugar addiction , particularly for people with susceptible brain chemistry , is gaining a lot of currency in integrative and alternative medicine and nutritional circles ( although you 'll rarely hear anything about it from conservatively  --  trained doctors or dietitians ) . If you think the insane amount of sugar we are now routinely feeding our kids is n't affecting more than their waistlines , think again . A recent study at California State University manipulated the diets of kids in 803 schools and nine juvenile correctional facilities . They gave them , among other things , more fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were astonishing . Grades rose 16 percent and even more telling , the number classified as learningdisabled fell by almost half . Without going too far afield here let me just say this : attention deficit disorder ( ADD ) is not a Ritalin deficiency . We ignore the sugar and nutrition connection at our own peril . According to most estimates , we 're now taking in an unprecedented 20 percent of our calories from sugar and that number is growing every day . These sugars are most often in the form of convenience and packaged foods . Fat-free foods are some of the worst offenders . Remember our old friend insulin ? Well nothing raises it like sugar and as we 've seen , consistently high levels of insulin make it virtually impossible to lose weight , not to mention making it a lot more probable that you will be a lot less healthy . Which leads us to the million dollar question : Why does the food industry and medical establishment continue to tell us that the best way to lose weight is to eat the very foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no distinctions among types of carbohydrates . The pyramid provides no inherent way of distinguishing junk carbohydrates from the real deal . One serving of slow-cooking whole grain oatmeal would be equal to the same amount of the latest **26;1436;TOOLONG cold cereal . That 's like telling everyone to buy a car and forgetting to tell them the difference between Yugos and Mercedes . Cauliflower and Twinkies are both carbohydrates , just as DHA and margarine are both fats . There is a huge difference between carbohydrates from vegetables and low-sugar , high-fiber fruits like berries and the junk carbohydrates that fill most of our plates . The Shape Up plan does not recommend " no carbohydrates " - it recommends no junk carbohydrates . There 's a big difference . 5 The base of the food pyramid consists of foods that will cause many people to gain weight . Most commercial pastas , breads and cereals are nothing more than highly  --  refined , processed foods without any fiber and with most of the nutrients missing , even though the food industry throws a few back in after the fact in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise blood sugar quickly , leading to a surge of insulin and setting in motion a whole roller coaster of events that ultimately result in both weight gain and poor health . The orthodox nutrition establishment tries to weasel out of this predicament by giving lip service to whole grains , which are definitely an improvement over the refined ones . But the problem is this-most Americans have never seen a whole grain . The commercial products on the market , despite an effort to market to the idea that " brown is better , " are usually little more than refined grains with a bit of whole wheat thrown in , or sometimes just some coloring . Remember that just because something started life as a whole grain does n't automatically mean that you 're getting any health benefits from it by the time it 's been turned into commercial bread . The whole process of making flour out of any whole grain involves so much pulverization , processing and heating that very few nutrients are left by the time it winds up on your plate . Furthermore , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grains in general . It 's far from dear that grains ought to make up the bulk of our diet . Wheat , for example , is one of the 10 most common allergens and in susceptible people can cause bloating and a host of other more serious symptoms often unattributed to the amount of wheat ( or other grains ) they are consuming . Remember that grains are a pretty " late comer " from an evolutionary , Paleolithic perspective . As Loren Cordain points out in Cereal Grains : Humanity 's Double Edged Sword , it 's pretty unlikely that the planet will be able to survive without adapting to grains as a food source  --  but that does n't mean that you as an individual with other options available need to rely on them nearly as heavily as the food pyramid folks think you should . The brilliant researcher Dr. C. Leigh Broadhurst once said to me that if she had to pick one strategy to recommend to chronically overweight people it would be to cut out wheat . At the very least , it 's something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grain products get the lion 's share of the food pyramid ? Well , if I went to the XYZ Dog Chow company and asked them to make a food pyramid for dogs , what do you think would be on it ? Do you need a second guess ? I 've got news for you . Left to their own devices in the wild , dogs do n't eat XYZ Dog Chow . They eat what their canine ancestors have eaten for as long as they 've been on the planet . Like us , their basic plumbing has n't changed . Preparing food that our domesticated best friends naturally prefer many not be as easy as opening a can or ripping open an easy  --  pour bag , but that is what they were built to eat nonetheless . I 'm not saying there 's anything wrong with letting the XYZ Dog Chow companies of the world help us out here , but I am saying it 's a little dangerous when you let them , under the guise of scientific objectivity be responsible for teaching us dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pop quiz : What is the number one source for nutritional information in the United States ? The dairy industry-which leads us nicely to our next questionable assumption . 6 The food pyramid assumes everyone should have dairy . Fully more than half the world 's population is lactose intolerant ( 75 percent in the case of African Americans ) , which may cause bloating , abdominal pain and diarrhea after milk is consumed . So it 's hard to understand the food pyramid recommendation that everyone should consume two to three servings of dairy a day until you recall that the dairy industry is the number one source of nutritional information in this country . Being hammered with slogans like " You never outgrow your need for milk " and cute ads featuring gorgeous models with milk moustaches does not change the fact that milk is hardly a healthy nor necessary food for adults . Naturally fermented dairy products like yogurt are a different story and are often tolerated well even by people who do n't tolerate milk . And certain cheeses like natural Swiss , are a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bottom line : Dairy is n't for everyone and all dairy is n't created equal . 7 The food pyramid is aimed at the " average person . " There is no such thing as the average person . Think about it  --  in what way are you average ? It 's demonstrably true that people of different ages , sexes , stress levels , activity levels , genetics and metabolic types have different nutritional needs  --  sometimes dramatically so . Even you at different points in your life have substantially different needs . How is it possible for the same old tired nutritional formula to be perfect for an active 18-year-old , a stressed-out college student , an expectant mother , an active 38-year-old mother of two , a menopausal CEO and a senior citizen bicycling around the country ? The answer : It 's not . 8 The food pyramid makes no allowances for seasonal changes in eating habits . One of the many differences between our Paleolithic , hunter-gatherer forebears and us is that they did n't have supermarkets . Through the modern miracles of manufacturing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it possible for us to have any kind of food , any time of year , anywhere in the world . This is quite out of sync with our long-buried ancestral impulses to go out into the woods and gather and hunt whatever is available at a particular time of year . One of the few principles of macrobiotic eating with which I agree is the one that suggests you eat what is grown locally and in season . Stuff changes . Many people are more active in the warm weather and more sedentary in the cold . This in turn affects all kinds of things including mood , serotonin production and even insulin sensitivity ( vitamin D-3 , which you get from sun exposure , has an effect on glucose metabolism ) . Your environment is not static and neither are you and it might just be a good idea to let your eating habits mirror that pulse . Fruits , for example , cool and hydrate the body , something we need far more of in the summer months than we do in the winter . Some rotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view . The " all-pyramid , all-the-time " approach makes no allowance for this . I 'll go on record as saying that I think the Shape Up plan for health and weight loss is a far healthier and more flexible set of guidelines to use than the USDA food pyramid . Here 's the recipe : Protein from high-quality sources , like eggs , whey protein powder , lean organic meats , free-range poultry and uncontaminated fish , tons of tons of vegetables , low-sugar , high-fiber fruits like berries and fat from the best sources on the planet like fish , nuts , avocados , extra-virgin , cold-pressed olive oil , flaxseed , coconut and occasionally butter . Some raw foods or vegetable juices every day . Small amounts of " good guy " starches like sweet potatoes , oatmeal and maybe lentils or beans . Add to the menu naturally fermented products like miso , tempeh , yogurt and kefir . If you like , have some cheese , especially soft ones or ones made from raw milk . The exact mix , proportions and amounts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on which you can live healthily for the rest of your life .
