THE HUNT <P> The U.S.-led military campaign has devastated al-Qaeda 's training infrastructure , destroyed its sanctuary and scattered its forces . But thousands of al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters survived the war , and some are regrouping at the Afghanistan-Pakistan border . The latest fighting is taking place on the border in Paktia province , where some 1,000 allied troops are hunting down about 100 al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters . " That is where most of these guys have gone to ground , " a Central Command officer says . <P> But no one knows whether the most prized targets  --  Osama bin Laden ; his top deputy , Ayman al-Zawahiri ; and Taliban leader Mullah Omar  --  are among them . Last week a London-based Arab newspaper carried a purported interview with Omar in which he claimed that bin Laden is alive , warned that " we do n't consider the battle has ended " and vowed to bring " fire and hell and total defeat " on the U.S. <P> Bin Laden 's ability to plan more attacks has been degraded , but the danger he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intelligence officials say they continue to pick up " chatter " from al-Qaeda operatives vowing to strike another huge blow . Last Friday Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said he has n't seen " good , hard information " on the fate of bin Laden and Omar since December . " We continue to see scraps , " he said . " But none of it seems to prove out . " <P> PLUGGING HOLES <P> After Sept. 11 , the Bush Administration tried to bolster the federal counterterror effort by creating the Office of Homeland Security under Tom Ridge . The office is responsible for plugging holes in the bureaucracy and coordinating some 70 federal agencies and thousands of local government organizations  --  but Ridge wields little clout over any of them . Bush gave him no authority over Cabinet departments ; as a result , many of Ridge 's proposals have stalled . Now the Administration is studying ways to give Ridge 's office the power he needs to get the job done . The redesign will be unveiled in July . <P> The CIA and the FBI , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration officials about the hijacking threat , are trying to make up for their mistakes . The staff of the CIA 's Counterterrorism Center , where FBI and CIA agents work side by side , has doubled to 1,000 since Sept. 11 . Analysts from both agencies have worked closely to investigate al-Qaeda materials recovered by the military in Afghanistan for clues to possible terror plots . Bush now receives reports from both agencies in a single daily briefing . But the intelligence community is still struggling to get up to speed . Last week FBI Director Robert Mueller announced plans to create a " supersquad " of Washington-based agents to handle terrorism investigations . It will require the bureau to hire almost 2,000 new agents in the next 18 months . <P> AIRPORT SECURITY
