<p> Similar to many of the artists in this issue , Ken Budd is steeled in his allegiance to the traditional techniques of drawing and painting . The symbols and metaphors of his still lifes , however , manifest his fascination with the modern world . <p> Oil painter Ken Budd believes unequivocally that a modern viewpoint and traditional forms of painting can coexist . A painter and teacher of classical realism at the historic Fenway Studios in Boston , Budd features objects of modem culture in his still lifes and juxtaposes them with classical subjects . " It is essential that artists pay homage to the richness of humanity 's past , both culturally and spiritually , " he stresses . " Whether the painting is of conventional subject matter or more modem , it 's important that my work speak to the themes , needs , and desires that are timeless . " <p> Paradoxically , this reverence for the past provides a framework for Budd to communicate his ideas about the world today . " As a classical realist , an artist may explore traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a still life , and in many ways that approach lends itself to a modern context , " he explains . For example , in Quo Vadis Budd wanted to create a piece whose historical source represents not only the classical Dutch tabletop still life set with opulent food and silverware , but also antiquity . " I am basically after a sense of the ironic , perhaps the darkly humorous , by taking a genre of the past and setting it in a modem context . The bust is of Roman origin ; the poster is of the movie Ben Hur , one of the themes of which is violent revenge . The television set is turned on but shows a blank screen , coaxing the viewer to picture his or her own images . This is classical realism with a twist . " <p> In all of Budd 's paintings , symbolism and metaphor are a focal point . In Parable of the Ego , for instance , the anatomical figure wearing a fedora much too large for his head refers to a self-important , swelled head , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adding , jokingly , that he himself sometimes wears the fedora while painting to reduce glare . " The tiller wheel , sextant , and microscope are elements of guidance from which the figure is walking away . The mirror in the painting serves as a visual reference to purgatory , which the figure of Dante suggests . The figure , however , is merely a reflection in the mirror , a flat surface , and not in the space of the painting itself , metaphorically referring to something not of this world . " Budd believes that the theme of an inflated ego leading to blindness is timeless and not necessarily a modem viewpoint , although he added a model car and crystalline structure model to provide a 20th-century dimension . <p> Budd works under natural , north light . He paints from life with minimal or no use of photography and insists that doing so forces him to observe acutely the delicate balance that nature provides . <p> He usually decides the borders of the composition as well as the eventual size of the painting by viewing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract composition of light and dark shapes pleases him , he moves on to small , quick oil paintings on 9 " - x- 12 " canvas board . He then stretches the full-size canvas . <p> Budd first masses in the painting in terms of light- and shadow-color relationships . At this point , the concepts of light , color , and atmosphere come into play . " It is essential for me as a painter to coordinate these three factors in the masses in order for the painting to remain true to nature , " he remarks . " The light must relate to the color , the color to the light , and they both must relate to the atmosphere . " From this point he further subdivides the various mass relationships " until the painting takes on a more realistic look , " the artist explains . " Even with the most minute area , however , I insist that it maintain a kind of abstract , painterly look , yet appear realistic at a distance . " After subdividing , he selects the main point of interest or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finishes that part of the work completely . Budd 's final check focuses on the edges and , ensuring an overall appropriate softness . <p> In keeping to the classical method Budd paints with the sight-size method , in which the figure or still-life subject matter and the canvas are positioned side by side , and the artist makes all decisions from a distance of about 10 feet . " When I walk to the canvas to paint , " the artist explains , " I seldom view the subjects ; only when stepping away do I view both the subject and the canvas . The advantage of this method is an assurance that the artist will more readily see mistakes . It also serves as valuable training for the eye . <p> " Two four-hour work sessions are the best for me , a 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. session and one from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. ( 4 p.m. in the dark of winter ) . An antique cheval mirror firmly set behind me is an invaluable aid in checking my work , " the artist notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 colors , with no black . Generally , it consists of cadmium lemon yellow , yellow light , yellow medium , orange , scarlet , quinacridone red , yellow ochre , raw sienna , burnt sienna , cerulean blue , cobalt blue , ultramarine blue , permanent green light , viridian , permanent magenta , quinacridone violet , and white . For landscapes he adds cadmium yellow green . Most of his colors are professional-grade Winsor &; Newton or Canson-Talens . Odorless paint thinner is his medium of choice . <p> Budd 's preferred brush type is a bristle brush . He is particularly fond of the short Grumbacher filbert , the Edgar Degas , Nos. 8 through 12 . " For more refinement of details , I usually revert to Loew-Cornell sable filberts down to a No. 2 , ' he says , " and for highlights , I rely on sable spotters from Nos. 0 to 00 . " Budd prefers double-primed Belgian linen canvas from Utrecht . At times he paints on untempered 1/4 " Masonite with a ground of an acrylic gessomodeling paste . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushwork and gradually achieving a more tightly finished , realistic look depending on what he wants to express in a particular painting . <p> When Budd graduated with a B.F.A . from the State University of New York at Stony Brook , he was so frustrated in terms of what he wanted to learn that he temporarily gave up painting and drove a taxi in New York City . At the Art Students League of New York he attended a demonstration lecture on anatomy by Gustav Rehberger and was " floored , " as he puts it , by the knowledge and skill exhibited there . " It was nothing like I had ever seen before , " he recalls . Enamored by what the league had to offer , he studied pastel and oil painting with Daniel E. Greene and , later , Richard Goetz ; drawing with Robert Beverly Hale , Michael Burban , and Hilary H. Holmes . But it was Goetz who encouraged him to study impressionism with Henry Hensche at the Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown , Massachusetts , where he learned more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere . One of the highlights of his career was when he was invited to study with Paul Ingbretson at Fenway Studios . <p> A private teacher of painting and drawing at various venues in Boston since 1988 , Budd has participated in myriad national and local juried exhibitions . Among them are ones sponsored by the Oil Painters of America and the Akron Society of Artists , as well as the Knickerbocker Artists Open Exhibition , at which he received the Grumbacher Gold Medal . <p> Budd 's work , which in addition to still lifes includes portraits and landscapes , is on view at The Copley Society of Boston , on consignment through Bakker Galleries of Boston , ArtSouth in Philadelphia , and on the Internet at art4business.com .
