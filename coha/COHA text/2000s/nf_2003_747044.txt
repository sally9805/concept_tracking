In recent years , human dignity has attracted considerable attention as a policy standard . From bioethics and constitutional law to torts and the regulation of the Internet , human dignity has seemingly become the most salient touchstone for assessing current policy initiatives . Yet dignity is a slippery concept , as illustrated by the opening scene of the movie Singin ' in the Rain. ( n1 ) Set at the premiere of a Monumental Pictures hit , the stars arrive in limousines and walk down a red carpet into the theater . While adoring fans " ooh " and " aah , " the screen celebrities grant brief interviews to a prominent gossip columnist . Don Lockwood , played by Gene Kelly , is asked to explain how he became a star . Lockwood responds with a speech in which he claims that he has always lived by a simple motto : " Dignity , Always Dignity . " <p> Lockwood then recounts episodes from his " privileged " upbringing , while the considerably less appealing reality of a hardscrabble childhood is depicted . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mom and Dad 's society friends , " as he is shown tap dancing in poolrooms to harmonica music and collecting thrown pennies from the floor . He talks of accompanying his parents to the theatre ( " They brought me up on Shaw , Moliere  --  the finest of the classics " ) as he is shown sneaking into B-movies . Playing fiddle in a three-man band in a smoky bar is labeled " rigorous musical training at the Conservatory of Fine Arts . " Similarly , " an apprenticeship at the most exclusive dramatics academy " is actually an amateur night audition with a slapstick vaudeville routine . The " dance concert tour at the finest symphonic halls in the country where audiences adored us " is a cross-country tour of obscure hamlets ( including Dead Man 's Fang , Arizona , and Coyoteville , New Mexico ) , during which Lockwood is regularly booed off the stage after tap dancing and fiddling . <p> Lockwood is " spinning " his origins , but the disparity between his words and objective reality implicates some of the difficulties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes too far to suggest that one man 's dignity is another man 's dishonor , but there are nonetheless broad areas of human existence on which there is little agreement about what behavior is dignified , let alone a consensus that dignity is the correct standard for judging conduct . Part I outlines some of the reasons for these difficulties . Part II considers the history of using dignity as a policy standard for regulating technology and innovation . Part III outlines several ways in which professional norms and forms of discourse undermine the possibility of using human dignity even in those areas where it has considerable saliency . Part IV offers a brief conclusion . I. PROBLEMS WITH DEFINING HUMAN DIGNITY <p> Assessments of human dignity are quite subjective , with considerable variation temporally , ( n2 ) chronologically , ( n3 ) geographically , ( n4 ) and culturally. ( n5 ) Social class , religion , wealth , and the degree of industrialization matter as well. ( n6 ) There is also a considerable degree of individual variation . Consider whether human dignity is enhanced , diminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloning , decriminalization of drug possession , gay marriage , genetically-modified food , gun control , legalized prostitution , partial-birth abortion , physician-assisted suicide , prohibition of hate speech , school prayer , school vouchers , state lotteries , and three-strikes laws . Would Ted Kaczynski ( the Unabomber ) , Ted Kennedy , Howard Dean , Zell Miller , George W. Bush , Ronald Reagan , and the Pope have the same answers to that question ? <p> Even if people agree that human dignity is the appropriate standard for assessing policy initiatives , they are only likely to agree on what is dignified for matters at the extreme end of the policy distribution ( e.g. , incest , slavery , and cannibalism ) . On matters that fall closer to the mean ( e.g. , organ transplantation , cloning , affirmative action , tobacco regulation , church-state relationships , hate crimes , private gun ownership , and euthanasia ) , the preferences of individual citizens , groups , and nations vary tremendously . <p> These preference variations are exceedingly important , since actual behavior ( including voting ) maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferences , and the inherent subjectivity of those preferences , it is unlikely that we , as a nation , will be able to settle on a single notion of human dignity , let alone be able to apply the resulting standard to a particular policy issue in a way that puts it permanently to rest . <p> Abortion provides a useful test case for these claims . Both sides believe with the utmost sincerity that human dignity is on their side . In the thirty-odd years since Roe v. Wade(n7) was decided , they have engaged one another repeatedly in the courts , legislatures , and media . Election campaigns have emphasized the candidate 's views on judicial bypass procedures , parental consent , and partial birth abortions . Protest marches , boycotts , and demonstrations have been staged ; lawsuits and counter-suits have been filed and litigated . The issue has been as thoroughly debated as any other subject in recent history . Yet neither side has been able to persuade the other that human dignity requires the result it advocates . The issue of abortion shows every indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Justices Kennedy , O'Connor , and Souter to conclusively end the debate in Planned Parenthood v. Case ) , was a complete flop. ( n8 ) To be sure , this outcome is not all that surprising when the best these three Justices could come up with was to assert it was all part of the mystery of human life . " ( n9 ) Alternatively , the American public may have concluded that the Supreme Court had neither expertise nor authority to decide what issues were appropriately open to public debate . <p> The Civil War provides another test case for these claims . Almost 140 years after Lee surrendered , the United States remains sharply divided on the purpose and necessity of the war . In the North , the Civil War is viewed as being solely about ( and therefore necessitated by ) slavery , an institution widely viewed as the greatest affront to human dignity in the history of the United States . In the South , by contrast , the central issue is perceived to be a conflict between state and federal power , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n10 ) Recent attempts to remove Confederate flags from state capitols or change state flags which incorporate Confederate symbols were viewed by manly Southerners as a direct assault on their heritage and their dignity. ( n11 ) To this day , Maryland 's state song is based on a poem intended to push Maryland into the Confederacy  --  not that the residents of Baltimore needed much encouragement. ( n12 ) The first stanza of the song refers to Abraham Lincoln as a despot , and the last verse proclaims that Maryland " spurns the Northern scum . " ( n13 ) All attempts to change the state song to something less offensive to the dignity of " Northern scum " have proven unsuccessful. ( n14 ) <p> In short , although there is unanimity of opinion on a handful of issues , perspective matters when it comes to human dignity. ( n15 ) Subsidiarity offers one way out of this box , as local decisions are much more likely to reflect majoritarian local preferences  --  particularly where exit is an option. ( n16 ) Yet subsidiarity encourages the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the claim that there is a single coherent notion of human dignity separate from the idiosyncratic preferences of those writing and enforcing the rules. ( n17 ) <p> The subjectivity of human dignity as a policy standard is compounded by the variability between first- and third-party assessments of dignity . What I consider to be dignified behavior may not comport with your expectations . Worse still , even if I respect your assessment of your own dignity , I may be reluctant to embrace legislation or regulation that reflects that assessment for symbolic or instrumental reasons . Indeed , one might well select a default rule inconsistent with widespread preferences in order to force individuals to conclusively reveal their actual preferences . <p> The disputes that periodically erupt over end-of-life care surface these tensions . Most Americans do not wish to receive certain forms of end-of-life care , yet non-treatment has not become the legislatively-mandated default rule. ( n18 ) Indeed , some states require " clear and convincing proof " that an individual wishes to terminate treatment , when the opposite approach ( i.e. , requiring clear and convincing proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual distribution of preferences regarding end-of-life care in the population. ( n19 ) Why then have legislators adopted a default rule favoring treatment ? One possibility is that they might have believed that the consequences of erroneous over-treatment are less significant than the consequences of erroneous under-treatment . Alternatively , they might have believed that a default rule mandating non-treatment would undermine society 's general commitment to the sanctity of human life . It is not necessary to differentiate between these two possibilities to conclude that first- and third-party assessments of the requirements of human dignity are likely to differ , both frequently and systematically . <p> More importantly , variation between first- and third-party assessments of dignity can have real consequences . Consider the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington , D.C. , located just off the Mall next to the Tidal Basin. ( n20 ) Situated in a park filled with waterfalls and reflecting pools , the memorial itself is composed of four outdoor galleries , one for each term of Roosevelt 's presidency , the progress of which " is recorded in bronze bas-relief , sculptured figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in walls of carnelian granite . " ( n21 ) Since its opening in 1997 , the memorial has drawn millions of visitors each year and is widely perceived as a stunning tribute to President Roosevelt and his accomplishments. ( n22 ) <p> Unfortunately , the memorial President Roosevelt actually wanted was much more modest . He told Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter that the only memorial he wanted was a plain desk-sized block of stone , bearing the simple inscription " In Memory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt , " to be placed in a grassy spot near the front of the National Archives. ( n23 ) In accordance with President Roosevelt 's wishes , a plain three- by six-foot block of unornamented marble sits in that location , ignored and virtually unnoticed , ( n24 ) while the $48,000,000 memorial he did not want receives millions of tourists annually. ( n25 ) The symbolic utility of the monument Roosevelt did not want  --  and the shortcomings of the memorial he had requested  --  became clear to me when I showed a visiting colleague the monument in front of the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A family of curious tourists joined us to read the small bronze plaque that describes President Roosevelt 's wishes for his own memorial . After looking at the explanation and memorial for about five seconds , one person pronounced it " boring " and expressed interest in getting ice cream . <p> If we are prepared ( and even enthusiastic , in some cases ) to privilege third-party assessments of dignity despite the existence of crystal-clear evidence of first-party wishes , how much more likely is it that we will do so when the evidence of first-party wishes is less obvious  --  if it is available at all ? Thus , before we can assess the consequences that should flow from an assertion of human dignity , we must decide whose assessment of that dignity actually counts . Relying primarily on third-party assessments will lead to the paradoxical effect of undermining dignity by privileging the opinions of elites instead of the autonomous choices of those most affected . Elites may well believe that they would make better choices than their less well-informed and less articulate fellow citizens , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which first-party assessments should be accorded considerable deference , if not dispositive weight . <p> Behavioral economics offers two additional reasons  --  future selves and group polarization  --  to be skeptical of the utility of human dignity as a policy standard . " Future selves " refers to the fact that we do not necessarily know what our future preferences will be. ( n26 ) If we can not accurately predict our future preferences , it becomes extremely difficult to use human dignity to protect us from problematic decisions and technological innovations . Indeed , even our best efforts could easily misfire , at least when judged by our future preferences . Worse still , future preferences are themselves influenced by present decisions . <p> Group polarization  --  the phenomenon that individuals who deliberate in a group often reach conclusions more extreme than those they held individually prior to deliberation  --  makes matters even worse. ( n27 ) What a group deems to be dignified can be greatly affected by the initial distribution of views among the deliberating group and is likely to differ from the results had there been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see why the results of these processes should be entitled to any particular deference on the grounds that they represent an immutable and invariant standard of human dignity . Instead , human dignity is clearly a highly contingent and contested vessel under the best of circumstances . II . A SHORT HISTORY OF TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN DIGNITY <p> For centuries , technology has enjoyed a generally favorable reputation in the Western world . The motto of the 1933 World 's Fair held in Chicago accurately captured the degree of techno-optimism : " Science finds ; Industry applies ; Man conforms . " ( n28 ) However , not everyone shares this loyalty to technological innovation ; in every generation , philosophers , ethicists , religious figures , politicians , and professional worrywarts have cited human dignity as a reason to restrict innovation or prohibit it outright . Consider a few examples . Galileo was forced to recant his heliocentric views because the Roman Catholic Church had already embraced the Ptolemaic system as more consistent with Biblical revelation and with man 's dignity as God 's creation. ( n29 ) Indoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , automobiles , television , the Sony WalkmanT , and the franchise for women were all met with the objection that they were inconsistent with human dignity . The Industrial Revolution , which laid the foundation for the modern world , was criticized because machines were expected to destroy human dignity. ( n30 ) Even the lowly potato had difficulty being accepted in most of the world because people thought it was beneath their dignity to eat " ugly , misshapen tubers ... that had come from a heathen civilization . " ( n31 ) <p> A list of future threats to human dignity would certainly include microwave popcorn , Twinkies , and " super-sized " French fries , since they contribute to obesity  --  a state that public health authorities believe is clearly inconsistent with maximizing human dignity. ( n32 ) What about pagers , cell phones , and BlackberriesT , all of which tend to isolate people from one another and force them to work all the time ? What about the Internet , which makes pornography available twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week to anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventions about which the editorial pages are perpetually exercised ( e.g. , sport utility vehicles , daytime talk shows , reality television , smoking , and drinking ) ? What about commodification , the bte noire of communitarians ? ( n33 ) Unless those determining the substantive standards for human dignity are libertines or libertarians , life will quickly become extremely dull . <p> To be sure , the pursuit of knowledge and the resulting technological advances bring their own unintended consequences , some of which are distinctly unpleasant. ( n34 ) The higher the risks and stakes , the more prudent it is to be cautious , but a precautionary approach imposes its own costs. ( n35 ) Those inclined to " cry wolf " on any and all occasions have no incentive to do otherwise if their future predictions are not discounted for past over-statements . <p> Finally , it is useful to ask , " Compared to what ? " when scoring the costs and benefits of innovation . As C.P. Snow neatly observed : " It was no fun being an agricultural laborer in the mid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snobs that we are , think of only as the time of the Enlightenment and Jane Austen . " ( n36 ) III . THE EFFECT OF PROFESSIONAL NORMS AND DISCOURSE <p> Human dignity is an abstract aspiration , but policy decisions are necessarily concrete . These decisions must therefore be created and implemented by those " in the trenches , " but there is little evidence to suggest that anyone in the trenches really wants to use human dignity as the touchstone for decision-making or has any particular expertise in this area . Indeed , local norms and modes of discourse routinely undermine the ability of practicing professionals ( such as physicians , scientists , and lawyers ) to actually use human dignity as a decision rule , even were they inclined to do so . Consider the following revealing observations from a well-known physician-anthropologist following his residency in internal medicine : <p> I have developed the impatience with ethical discussions characteristic of most house officers . It is n't that I do n't consider them important , it 's just that I do n't consider them my job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning , the rules laid down by society . Tell me in plain English what the Do Not Resuscitate order means and exactly whom it applies to , and I will carry it out . Tell me which fetuses you want saved and which thrown away ; to the best of my technical ability , I will comply . Tell me what sort of craziness warrants involuntary commitment and I will know which patients to keep off the street . Tell me the rules  --  define them as strictly as you can  --  for taking the heart out of patient A and putting it into patient B , and I will go on with that dazzling technical miracle ; I wo n't have pangs of conscience , which I really do n't need and which only make my work harder. ( n37 ) <p> Lest these observations be dismissed as an idiosyncratic anecdote , it is clear that law has largely replaced ethics as the " decider " of such controversies. ( n38 ) Physicians now routinely defer to ethics committees and legal counsel , and risk-aversion has become a widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of their time determining where and how the law has defined boundaries for professional discretion , instead of dealing with medical ethics . <p> Anyone who thinks these institutional changes have somehow made human dignity the touchstone for all decisions does not know many lawyers . Consider the fate of legal ethics in the modern academy , where , over the past few decades , the relevant course has changed from " legal ethics " to " professional responsibility " to " the law of lawyering . " These changes parallel the rise of a legalistic approach to these issues ; punitive disciplinary rules supersede aspirational standards , private litigation trumps norms of practice and professional self-regulation , and rule-bound procedural justice replaces open-textured professional discretion . <p> Scientists also turn out to be highly unreliable advocates for human dignity . With all due respect to practicing scientists , introspection about the implications of their work is not their strong suit. ( n40 ) Worse still , the default norms of science define the discovery and application of knowledge to be the highest manifestation of human dignity . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge or in favor of restrictions on technology . <p> The deliberations of the President 's Council on Bioethics regarding cloning demonstrates the consequences of these belief patterns . The Council includes four scientists and thirteen physicians , philosophers , law professors , and public intellectuals. ( n41 ) It voted unanimously to support a ban on cloning for reproduction ( " **27;1709;TOOLONG " ) but split 10-7 regarding a temporary ban on cloning for research. ( n42 ) Although a substantial majority ( 71% ) of the non-scientists supported the temporary ban , not one of the four scientists concurred . Instead , each scientist filed a personal statement reciting the importance of this research and the benefits of allowing scientists to pursue knowledge more or less as they saw fit. ( n43 ) <p> Finally , leave aside the variability of the standards likely to be employed by those in the trenches and focus on the decision-making process . If the past is even remotely predictive of the future , those implementing these standards are likely to overestimate their expertise ( " often wrong , but never in doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own particular area of expertise , and generally adhere to the path-dependent social norm that prevails among their colleagues. ( n44 ) IV . CONCLUSION <p> Almost four centuries ago , Francis Bacon imagined a prosperous and happy society based on " the knowledge of causes , and secret motions of things ; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire , to the effecting of all things possible . " ( n45 ) He promised that these endeavors would result in the " relief of man 's estate . " ( n46 ) Today , we have far surpassed Bacon 's wildest dreams ; human invention , the protection of private property ( real and intellectual ) , hard work , good luck , and good laws have combined to make life immeasurably better . Romanticism about what has been lost is all well and good , but most people prefer to take advantage of the fruits of science and technology , and they find ways to reconcile it with their human dignity. ( n47 ) <p> To be sure , the recent controversies over science and technology have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The possibility of " engineering the engineer " raises more complicated and difficult questions ( and potentially greater risks to human dignity ) than the kind of problems we have faced in the past. ( n48 ) The systematic application of biotechnology and cloning may well lead us down the slippery slope to a Brave New World. ( n49 ) Each step has its own predictable logic , justified in no small part by the fact that a series of prior steps were taken. ( n50 ) <p> As a pragmatic matter , it may seem sensible to take a " better safe than sorry " approach to these matters , particularly if the risks and stakes are high enough. ( n51 ) Yet , our dismal record for predicting genuine risks to human dignity actually counsels in favor of a reverse precautionary principle in handling such matters. ( n52 ) <p> More generally , it is hard to see how human dignity can be quantified in a way that does not beg all of the hard questions about using it as a policy measure. ( n53 ) If dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how appealing as a policy standard it might otherwise appear to academics. ( n54 ) As such , although there is likely to be a considerable amount of storm and fury on the subject of human dignity in coming years , it is unlikely that any of this effort will actually do much to enhance human dignity . Instead , there is a significant risk that these efforts will actually undermine the cause they seek to advance . <p> Given the difficulties identified in this article , one obvious question remains : " Why has human dignity taken center stage as a policy standard ? " A full response to this question lies beyond the scope of this article , but the most important reason is that human dignity constitutes the moral " high ground " in most policy disputes . Neither side is willing to surrender this valuable terrain to the enemy , and the plasticity of the underlying standard makes it possible for both to assert ownership of the moral high ground with the utmost good faith. ( n55 ) Unfortunately , once both sides have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest dispute on a minor issue is converted into a super-charged normative battle . Compromise solutions are much less appealing when first principles are ( or seem to be ) at stake . <p> In The Music Man , Professor Harold Hill warns the citizens of River City that the arrival of a pool table " spells trouble with a capital T " for the positive social norms that prevail in their community. ( n56 ) He explains that playing pool ( instead of billiards ) necessarily leads to sloth , " the first big step on the road to the depths of degradation . " ( n57 ) In short order , the children of River City will start smoking , drinking , gambling , and even worse behavior. ( n58 ) <p> Of course , Professor Hill is exploiting the fears of the parents of River City so he can sell them band uniforms and instruments for their children . Playing pool does not inevitably lead to human degradation , and participating in a band does not inevitably avoid that state . Similarly , technology is not pool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are behaving more like Professor Harold Hill . More importantly , even if some forms of technology could rightly be deemed " trouble with a capital T , " human dignity is not an effective policy tool with which to attack that problem . <p>
