There was a moment in the fall , back when baseball was suspended and planes were empty , when the prospect of the 2002 Winter Olympics was confounding at every turn . We were waging war ; who could think of fun and Games ? Some Salt Lake City residents , sensing a bull's-eye painted on their town , wished it would all be canceled ; students petitioned that their school be closed for security reasons . The athletes , like the rest of us , were disturbed , distracted ; a couple had lost relatives in the attacks . NBC was worried that its $545 million investment for broadcast rights might be wasted , and started polling to see if anyone planned to watch . <P> But as the Olympic torch burned its way from Olympia to Atlanta , then started winding toward Salt Lake , the ground began to warm . The flame will travel 13,500 miles by dogsled and wheelchair and snowshoe and tennis shoe and tugboat . Rudy Giuliani carried it , exempted from the organizing committee 's rule against elected officials as torchbearers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Flight 93 , carried it , along with 11,498 others , through frigid streets lined with cheering people  --  and that was just for the torch . <P> Olympic organizers , more determined than ever to market the meaning , began talking about the Games as a chance for restoring America 's hope . There were recollections of the 1980 U.S. hockey team that won its proxy war against the Soviets , who themselves were then at war in Afghanistan . These Games would transcend even politics and patriotism on their way toward therapy . " This is an important event under any circumstance , " Utah Governor Mike Leavitt had said a few weeks after the attacks , " but fate may have fallen upon this state and city to host an event where the world will come together to heal . " <P> That 's a lot to ask , given the history : 2002 had been called the Bribery Games , for the million-dollar booty dangled before Olympic bigwigs by Salt Lake officials in hopes of its being picked as host . Once the financial scandals passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed , although the government is appealing  --  the security nightmare erupted . Ever since the Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta in 1996 , law-enforcement agencies have known they would have to reinvent Salt Lake 's security . The Atlanta budget was more than doubled for Salt Lake , and after Sept. 11 , it increased an additional 25% , to $300 million , for the creation of the Bubble . There will be metal detectors and spy cameras everywhere , antibiotics and vaccines stockpiled , F-16s overhead and the Secret Service on snowmobiles . It 's a whole new team sport , the FBI and Secret Service for once sharing information , patrolling in tandem . Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge has called Salt Lake the safest place in the world ; but , he adds , there is no guarantee that the system is fail-safe.
