What The Lady Wants By Jennifer Crusie Harlequin Enterprises Limited Chapter One Mae Sullivan frowned up at the grimy old office building and shifted from one aching spike-heeled foot to the other , trying to keep the weight off her blisters . From the looks of the neighborhood , her chances of getting mugged were only slightly greater than the chances of the building falling on her . Only a loser would work in a place like this . Good . It had n't been easy finding an incompetent private eye on such short notice in a midwestern city like Riverbend . But now there was Mitchell Peatwick . She could picture him , leaning back in his office chair , balding and overweight , slack-jawed and beady-eyed , no brains to speak of . He 'd patronize her because she was female . She 'd play him like a piano . All she had to do was convince him that he was investigating a real murder case , and he 'd swing his paunchy weight around , creating noise and confusion until whoever had taken her uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bury it forever if he did n't want to be accused of murder . Yep , that was all she had to do . So go do it . She took a deep breath and winced as the waistband of her borrowed pink skirt cut into her flesh . Then she pulled the veil on her hat over her eyes and walked toward the cracked glass doors of the old building , watching her reflection as she climbed the steps . Even through the dumb pink veil , she really did look sexy . It was amazing what clothes could do . Now , if she could just get this damn interview over with before the waistband of June 's skirt cut her in two and June 's heels made her lame for life , she 'd be on her way to solving all of their problems . Please let Mitchell Peatwick be dumb as a rock with a weakness for women in tight skirts , she prayed as she rang for the elevator . Please let him be everything I need him to be . * * * The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan above him stirred the air , and Mitch was sure if he got any hotter , he 'd die . As it was , he was pretty sure that the only thing that kept him alive was the fact that he was n't moving . If he moved , his body temperature would rise , and he 'd melt right there in his office chair . He did n't want to move , anyway . He was too depressed to move . He leaned back in his cracked leather desk chair - sleeves rolled up , hands laced behind his head , heels crossed on his battered metal desk - and thought about the way he 'd planned things and the way they 'd turned out . Big difference there . Anticipation was a lousy preparation for reality . That 's why he was giving it up for fantasy . Fantasy was not particularly productive , nor was it lucrative , but it beat reality hands down . Reality sucked . Fantasy was leaving a prosperous career to become a private detective . Reality was regretting it . He closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part where he 'd be the Sam Spade of the nineties . Then the elevator cables rumbled across the hall and Mitch knew another divorce job was coming his way . He had n't had many illusions about relationships before , he thought sadly , but he had absolutely none now . Even the people who were n't married had him investigate to see if the people they were n't married to were telling the truth . And of course , they were n't . That was the one irrevocable truth Mitch had learned in a year , the only thing , he realized now , that he 'd taken away with him . Everybody lied . Sam Spade would have understood that part , but he would have spit on the divorce work . Mitch had the uncomfortable feeling that he should be spitting on it , too , instead of making a precarious living at it . Too precarious . He had one week left in the year , one week to earn the last of the twenty thousand dollars and win his stupid bet and go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a client who would shell out $2,694 before Friday . It was n't going to happen . Prying money out of clients was the second least favorite thing he 'd learned about this job . So when he heard the elevator cables rumble in the hall opposite his office door , he did n't leap to his feet with enthusiasm . It was n't just because the heat would kill him if he moved . It was also because it had been a long time since he 'd done anything with enthusiasm , and he 'd forgotten how it worked . If I was Sam Spade , this would be Brigid O'Shaughnessy . The ancient ceiling fan creaked above him , and buttery sunlight spattered over him , and in spite of himself , he began to feel optimistic again . Maybe hope was n't dead yet . Maybe this was a Brigid heading his way , a woman uninterested in marriage and commitment , willing to seduce him to get what she wanted . He was sure as hell willing to be seduced . She would come into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of those white suits with the wide lapels and a tight skirt that was slit to the hip . She 'd have incredible legs . And maybe she 'd be wearing a hat over her glossy red curls , a dark veil that dusted over blue , blue eyes and a straight little nose above moist , pouty lips . And in between the lips and the legs would be the best part . Her jacket would be tight under her breasts . Round breasts . Full , round breasts . High , full , round breasts . With an effort , Mitch pried his mind off the breasts . And she 'd come in and say , " I need you to find the Maltese Falcon , " and her voice would be throaty and soft . And somewhere along the way , she 'd take off her hat , and they 'd have passionate , steamy , slippery , sweaty sex ... Mitch lingered for a moment on the sex .... and then he 'd find out that she 'd been the guilty one all along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , " he 'd say , and they 'd take her away for murdering his partner . Okay , he did n't have a partner unless he counted Newton , and nobody ever counted Newton , but still .... No wonder that book was a classic . Sam Spade got to nail her without a commitment and still feel good about himself when he dumped her . First , great sex , and then he walked out on her , free as a bird , a hero instead of a schmuck . Now there was a fantasy . Then the door opened , and he looked up , and she came in . Her hair was dark brown , and so were her eyes behind the veil , and her suit was pink instead of white , but everything else was pretty much his fantasy . The nose , the lips , the ... " I 'll be damned . " With enormous effort , Mitch raised his eyes from her breasts to her face . " Probably . " Her low voice reverberated straight into his spine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mitch swung his feet to the floor and stood up , wiping his sweaty palm on his shirt before offering her his hand . " Mitch Peatwick , private investigator . Listen , did you ever read The Maltese Falcon ? " " Yes . " She ignored his hand as she surveyed the dingy office , her pout deepening as she took in the cracks in the upholstery and the dust . " Is this really your office ? " ( Continues ... )
