A bare stage . We see two women smoking . They are LILLIAN HELLMAN and MARY MCCARTHY . They 're wearing suits and heels . LILLIAN HELLMAN Did we ever meet ? MARY MCCARTHY Once or twice . LILLIAN HELLMAN I do n't really remember . MARY MCCARTHY Well , then I do n't remember , either . LILLIAN HELLMAN All right . Where was it ? MARY MCCARTHY At Sarah Lawrence College . Stephen Spender invited us to speak  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN I was invited . You turned up . MARY MCCARTHY You thought I was a student because I looked quite young . LILLIAN HELLMAN I did n't even notice you . MARY MCCARTHY My point . I walked onto the sunporch , and you were telling all of them a huge lie  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Naturally  --  MARY MCCARTHY  --  about the Spanish civil war . I could n't bear it . You were brainwashing them , and they were looking at you like wide-eyed converts . So I interrupted and corrected you . And we had a fight . To the audience . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great many bracelets , gold and silver  --  A long string with a hook on the end falls from the rafters with a bunch of gold and silver bracelets dangling from it . LILLIAN puts them on .  --  and they began to tremble in her fury and surprise at being caught red-handed in a lie . LILLIAN holds out her arm and makes the bracelets jangle against one another , louder and louder . p. 3 LILLIAN HELLMAN Like that ? MARY MCCARTHY Exactly . The incident at Sarah Lawrence was in 1948 . I was teaching there at the time  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN I never had to do that . I did teach , but I never had to teach . Although once , after I testified , after I stood up on the bad morning before the House Un-American Activities Committee and said  --  LILLIAN AND MARY Together . " I can not and will not cut my conscience to fit this year 's fashions . " A beat as LILLIAN looks at MARY . LILLIAN HELLMAN You 're not suggesting I never said it . MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After I said it , and had to sell the farm  --  MARY MCCARTHY It was n't a farm . It was a house  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN It was too a farm . It was upstate  --  MARY MCCARTHY Westchester County is not upstate  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN There were cows and chickens  --  MARY MCCARTHY Fine . It was a farm  --  p. 4 LILLIAN HELLMAN  --  after that I had no money  --  MARY MCCARTHY  --  and no place to live but your New York town house  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Plunging on.  --  I had no money to speak of , but I did n't teach . I went to work part-time at Macy 's , selling groceries . MARY looks at her , entirely unbelieving . After a beat , she turns back to the audience and plunges on . MARY MCCARTHY Stephen Spender invited us to speak at Sarah Lawrence because we were  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Women . Let 's face it . MARY MCCARTHY You are so right . They were having a writers ' conference , and they could n't invite only men  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELLMAN We were the logical choices . MARY MCCARTHY There were others . LILLIAN HELLMAN Who ? MARY MCCARTHY There were plenty of others . LILLIAN HELLMAN Hmmph . MARY MCCARTHY Martha Gellhorn . LILLIAN HELLMAN She was good . p. 5 MARY MCCARTHY She was first-rate . LILLIAN HELLMAN During the war . But then what ? She took herself out of the running . She stayed in England , doomed to be known forever as Ernest Hemingway 's third wife . And no one reads her any more . Jean Stafford . MARY MCCARTHY Yes , I suppose Jean Stafford . LILLIAN HELLMAN Well , I do n't suppose Jean Stafford . I brought her up only to make myself seem open-minded . MARY MCCARTHY And she drank herself right out of the competition , did n't she ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Yes she did . MARY MCCARTHY And no one reads her anymore , either . LILLIAN HELLMAN No one reads any of us . MARY MCCARTHY " We all lead our lives more or less in vain . " I said that only a few months before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and death , and the sense that it had all beenfor nothing . To have no one know who you are after all that typing  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN  --  all that typing and thinking and drinking and flirting and fucking and feuding . But some of it was fun , was n't it ? We did n't do all that typing and thinking and drinking and flirting and fucking and feuding just so people would know who we were , did we ? A pause while they think about it.When would you say that you and I started feuding ? p. 6 MARY MCCARTHY From the beginning . And then , of course , the lawsuit . Lillian Hellman versus Mary McCarthy . LILLIAN HELLMAN We never liked each other . MARY MCCARTHY Yes , I was always hearing you did n't like me . LILLIAN HELLMAN Well , I was always hearing you 'd written mean things about me . MARY MCCARTHY I did n't write much about you . LILLIAN HELLMAN When you did , it was always mean . But we rarely saw one another . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea what you were going to look like after all those years . I was watching , you know . I saw you say it . I was lying in bed , completely happy at seeing how badly you 'd aged , and then you said it . And now , on the scrim behind them , we see a television show projected : MARY being interviewed by DICK CAVETT . DICK CAVETT Are there any writers you think are overrated ? MARY MCCARTHY The only one I can think of is a holdover like Lillian Hellman , who I think is tremendously overrated , a bad writer , and dishonest writer , but she really belongs to the past . DICK CAVETT What is dishonest about her ? p. 7 MARY MCCARTHY Everything . But I said once in some interview that every word she writes is a lie , including " and " and " the . " A beat . MARY MCCARTHY Most people outgrow the feuding , do n't you think ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Well , I never outgrew it . MARY MCCARTHY Nor I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LILLIAN HELLMAN " You must choose your enemies well . " MARY MCCARTHY Who said that ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Goethe . It 's my favorite line from Goethe . I once read a book about two U-boats . It was written with alternating chapters , and the first was about the German U-boat . The captain woke up in the morning and trimmed his mustache and spoke to the cook about sausages . Then came the chapter about the English U-boat , and the captain woke up in the morning and looked at the starboard diesel and spoke to the cook about kippers . This went on throughout the day , day after day , alternating , until the boats finally met up with one another . MARY MCCARTHY And then what happened ? Did they collide ? p. 8 LILLIAN HELLMAN They did collide . Shall I begin ? MARY MCCARTHY Why not ? You came first . LILLIAN looks around . We hear music.Music ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Why not ? We have musicians . Beat . I needa fig tree . She exits . p. 9 Act 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden house with a front porch . Next to it is a big fig tree . The ENSEMBLE does a cakewalk onto the stage as we hear a New Orleans band start to play . Maybe the band comes onto the stage , like a New Orleans parade procession . Projected on the back of the stage , we see the words " New Orleans " and a picture of baby Lillian . And the ensemble starts to sing " The Fig Tree Rag . " ENSEMBLE THERE 'S SOMETHIN ' HAPPENIN ' IN DIXIEI 'M FROM DIXIE SO I KNOWWE GOT A RAG WE CALL " THE FIG TREE " FOR THAT BIG TREE THAT WE GROWAND WHEN WE 'RE HOPPIN ' ON THE BAYOUI DEFY YOU TO BE STILLGET YOU A RAGGY TUNEGET YOU A CAJUN MOONGET YOU A JACK OR A JILL COME ON ALONGWE 'RE GON NA DO THE FIG TREE RAGYOUR BODY GON NA ZIG AND ZAGTAKE A LOOK ATEV'RY CHAP AND EV'RY CHIPPY ALL ALONG THE MISSISSIPPIDOIN ' THE DANCETHEY 'RE DANCIN ' TO THE FIG TREE RAGI WAN NA DO THE FIG TREE RAG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a child and wearing a white dress almost identical to the one in the picture . The effect should be half baby , half Baby Snooks . She walks toward the tree . p. 10 LILLIAN HELLMAN I was the sweetest-smelling baby in New Orleans . You probably heard that about me , and it is one hundred percent true . My father was a traveling salesman , so my mother and I lived in the Garden District with my two aunts , Jenny and Hannah , who owned a boardinghouse . I had a Negro nurse named Sophronia , who took care of me until I was six , when we began to spend half the year in New York and the other half back in New Orleans . Behind my aunts ' boardinghouse was a fig tree , an enormous fig tree . It was quite a ways from the house , and it was so leafy you could n't be seen . So I rigged up a seat for myself , and a set of pulleys for soda pop and books , and I would sit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block , who seemed wildly glamorous  --  ENSEMBLE COME WITH MEUP IN THE TREEUP IN THE TREEALL OUR TROUBLES ARE FAR AWAYSWING AND SWAYUP IN THE TREEUP IN THE TREE WE 'LL STAY LILLIAN HELLMAN There was Frances , whose father had been killed by the Mafia , and Louis , who took me to Mass , and Pancho , who once gave me a lock of his hair and then pushed me into the gutter , which was without question the most romantic thing that had ever happened  --  so romantic that I put the lock of hair into the back of a wristwatch my father had just given me for my birthday . And my watch stopped . LILLIAN climbs into a seat at the base of the tree and raises herself into it . p. 11 ENSEMBLE SO IF YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR A HAVENWITH A CRAVIN ' TO FULFILLI 'LL SHOW YOU WHAT HEAVEN MEANSMEET ME IN NEW ORLEANSI 'LL KEEP ON HUMMIN ' UNTILYA GET HERE COME ON ALONGWE 'RE GON NA DO THE FIG TREE RAGYOUR BODY GON NA ZIG AND ZAGYA GOT ME THINKIN'THIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDENADAM AND EVEWERE TRYIN ' OUT THE FIG TREE RAGI WAN NA DO THE FIG TREE RAG WITH YOUWITH YOU WE 'RE CRANKIN ' LIKE A HURDY GURDY LILLIAN HELLMAN FLAPPIN ' LIKE A PERDY BIRDY ENSEMBLE DOIN ' THE FIG TREE RAG LILLIAN HELLMAN From the tree I could also watch the people who lived in the boardinghouse  --  Mrs. Stillman , who was crazy , and Carrie , the cook , who plucked chickens in the yard , and Sarah and Fizzy , two dizzy sisters who were always picking on me and giggling over nothing . " She 's so wiiiiild and willful , " they 'd say , and just stand there together and giggle . FIZZY comes out of the boardinghouse and sits down on the porch.That 's Fizzy . Giggle for everyone , Fizzy . FIZZY giggles . FIZZY takes out a fan and fans herself in a kind of exaggerated southern way . MAX HELLMAN , Lillian 's father , comes from around the back of the house and looks at FIZZY as she sits there. And that 's my father . LILLIAN hides behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree . FIZZY turns and sees MAX HELLMAN. p. 12 FIZZY Max ! What a surprise . When did you get back ? MAX HELLMAN Train just got in . Beautiful morning , is n't it ? Even prettier now that I see you . FIZZY Giggles again . Oh , Max ! The leaves in the tree rustle wildly , but FIZZY and MAX HELLMAN do n't seem to notice . MAX HELLMAN What were you thinking about ? FIZZY Just now ? Summertime , and my mama 's hummingbird garden . Sarah and I used to sit still as statues on the stone bench and see if we could get the birds to buzz around our heads . Once I put a piece of honeysuckle in my mouth  --  MAX HELLMAN suddenly kisses FIZZY , a long , passionate kiss . LILLIAN spreads the branches of the tree just a little and peeks out wide-eyed at what 's happening . Then she closes them over herself again . MAX HELLMAN I missed you so much . Beat . Can I see you this afternoon ? FIZZY Two o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the house and closes the door . MAX HELLMAN walks off . A long beat . LILLIAN falls from the fig tree . Splat . A horrible noise . She lies face down on the ground . And now we see the real LILLIAN walk onstage and pick up the LILLIAN that fell from the tree  --  which turns out to be a large stuffed doll of LILLIAN . She carries it to the front porch , where she sits . She puts her hand melodramatically over her nose . p. 13 LILLIAN HELLMAN I broke my nose . So I went running off to find my old nurse , Sophronia . I told her I 'd seen Fizzy and my father kissing each other , and I decided to kill myself . Sophronia bandaged me up and told me that I must never ever tell anyone about Fizzy . I promised her I never would . A few minutes later , as she walked me home , she said , " Do n't go through life making trouble for people . " I said , " If I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't . " LILLIAN stands up , carrying the doll . Then she walks into the house and closes the door . The words " New Orleans " vanish from the scrim and are replaced with " Seattle , " and some sort of music begins . The baby picture of LILLIAN changes to one of MARY MCCARTHY . MARY comes onstage carrying a large doll of herself dressed like the little girl in the picture . She walks over to the musicians and looks at them . MARY MCCARTHY To the musicians . Please do n't . They stop playing . My father was a lawyer , although he never really practiced law . He was sick and home most of the time , and he read me stories in the daytime , and once , when we were together , we heard a nightingale sing , I remember that . My mother was beautiful , and she had three more children , my brothers , and one day when I was six years old , we all got on the train to go to Minneapolis to visit my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the influenza pandemic , and we all caught it on the train , and my parents died . The word on the scrim changes to " Minneapolis . " No one told us they 'd died . We got off the train in Minneapolis , and there were nurses and ambulances waiting , and I woke up weeks later and everything was different . We were orphans . Not that we 'd ever heard the word , and not that anyone had to tell us , really , because they told us in every way  --  there was to be no jam for the toast , and why anyone had ever let us have it in the first place no one knew , and " Sit up straight " and " Right this minute " and " Children should be seen but not heard , " especially spoiled children  --  that was the problem , you see , we were spoiled , like food that had been left out too long . Something would have to be done with us , but what ? And then , finally , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enormous relief , for she was old and plain as a wet sidewalk , and she and her new husband , Myers , were given a small house to live in , and the four of us wretched children . And still no one told us our parents were dead . No one ever told us . For a while they said Mommy and Daddy had gone to get well in the hospital . And then they stopped saying things like that , and it was assumed we all knew , even though we 'd never been told . UNCLE MYERS walks out of the house.That 's Uncle Myers . UNCLE MYERS takes out a leather razor strop and flicks it against the porch railing with a sharp snap.And that 's his razor strop . p. 14 UNCLE MYERS Mary  --  MARY MCCARTHY Yes , Uncle  --  UNCLE MYERS I gave your brother a tin butterfly several days ago . MARY MCCARTHY I know . From a Cracker Jack box . Will you get me one ? Please ? I would love one so much . UNCLE MYERS He ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY MCCARTHY No . So it 's lost ? UNCLE MYERS Well , that all depends , does n't it UNCLE MYERS flicks his strop against the railing again . Then he walks into the house . MARY MCCARTHY The last thing I remember about my father was that I was sitting with him on the train . We hear the sound of a train.Everyone else is sick , tossing in their sleeping berths , but we 're not , we 're sitting there together , and I feel so proud of my father  --  the conductor tried to throw us off the train because so many of us are sick , but my father had a gun and would n't let him . Now we 're riding through the Rockies , and he 's saying that sometimes there are boulders that tumble down and crush the train and kill all the passengers . I remember it so clearly  --  the moment my father lifts me up so I 'm standing on the seat , looking out the window as the mountains rush past . My heart is absolutely filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel completely safe because I 'm in his arms  --  The sound of the train dies away.But it never happened . My father was sick long before we rode through the Rockies , and he could n't possibly have told me anything about boulders . And no one tried to throw us off the train , and my father did n't have a gun , and there are no nightingales in North America . UNCLE MYERS comes out of the house again with the strop . p. 15 UNCLE MYERS Mary  --  He hits the strop against the railing with a sharp snap . BLACKOUT . p. 16 Act 1 , Scene 3 Scene 3 A nightclub . Two bars onstage , each with a BARTENDER mixing martinis . We 're in a wonderful nightclub . The BARTENDERS are wearing white jackets that exactly match what the bartenders wear in an early scene from The Thin Man . On the scrim are the words " New York . " And now we see LILLIAN and MARY , both in their late twenties and chic in simple black dresses , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARTENDERS pour their perfect drinks into stemmed glasses . LILLIAN and MARY each light a cigarette and blow smoke . The BARTENDERS sing " A Smoke , A Drink , and You .

The BARTENDERS pour another drink into MARY 'S and LILLIAN 's glasses , and each lights another cigarette . p. 17 MARY MCCARTHY Vassar . LILLIAN HELLMAN NYU . MARY MCCARTHY Graduated . LILLIAN HELLMAN Dropped out . MARY MCCARTHY Married . LILLIAN HELLMAN Married . BARTENDERS THEY 'LL BE ETERNALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCCARTHY New York . LILLIAN HELLMAN New York . MARY MCCARTHY I slept with Philip Rahv . LILLIAN HELLMAN I slept with Philip Rahv . BARTENDERS THEY SLEPT WITH PHILIP RAHV MARY MCCARTHY You did not sleep with Philip Rahv  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Once . Once was enough . BARTENDERS A SMOKE , A DRINK , AND YOU LILLIAN and MARY drain their drinks . The BARTENDERS pour each of them another . MARY MCCARTHY I was very beautiful . p. 18 LILLIAN HELLMAN I was not . MARY MCCARTHY And very smart . LILLIAN HELLMAN Whip-smart . MARY MCCARTHY Cold eye . LILLIAN HELLMAN Sharp tongue . MARY MCCARTHY Sharp tongue . LILLIAN HELLMAN cold eye . MARY MCCARTHY Loved danger . LILLIAN HELLMAN Loved trouble . MARY MCCARTHY Loved fights . LILLIAN HELLMAN Loved fights . MARY MCCARTHY Quick . LILLIAN HELLMAN Just as quick . MARY MCCARTHY And very beautiful . LILLIAN HELLMAN I wish I 'd been beautiful . MARY MCCARTHY I wish I 'd been rich . LILLIAN HELLMAN But if I 'd been beautiful , would any of it have happened ? MARY MCCARTHY And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been sued many more times than you were . Philip Rahv wanted to sue you and so did Edmund Wilson and so did all those girls you went to Vassar with . Even your own uncle wanted to sue you . p. 19 MARY MCCARTHY You wanted to sue me . LILLIAN HELLMAN And I did sue you . That 's where all this is leading . MARY MCCARTHY And I did n't have enough money to defend myself . LILLIAN HELLMAN But people gave it to you . People felt sorry for you and gave it to you . People who hated me gave it to you . People who hated you gave it to you because they hated me more . And you took the money  --  MARY MCCARTHY For my lawyers . LILLIAN HELLMAN Hmmph . A beat . MARY MCCARTHY I was very beautiful . LILLIAN HELLMAN And I was not . But I had something . A tall man walks up to the bar , and a BARTENDER starts to mix him a drink . This is DASHIELL HAMMETT . DASHIELL HAMMETT A MAN APPEARS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A NORAFOR WHOM WE MIGHT POUR A FEW DASHIELL HAMMETT QUITE A FEW BARTENDERS A CATCH OF A CATCH , SUCH A COUP p. 20 DASHIELL HAMMETT WE SPOKE DASHIELL HAMMETT AND LILLIAN WE DRANK , WE KNEW BARTENDER The usual , Mr. Hammett ? DASHIELL HAMMETT Quoting lines from The Thin Man . " You know , Vic , the important thing is rhythm . You always have rhythm in your shaking . A Manhattan you shake to a foxtrot . A Rob Roy you shake to two-step time . A dry martini you always shake to waltz time . " To LILLIAN . Say , how many drinks have you had ? LILLIAN HELLMAN This will make five martinis . DASHIELL HAMMETT All right , will you bring me four more martinis , Leo ? Line them up right here . DASHIELL HAMMETT starts to drink the martinis , one by one . LILLIAN HELLMAN After he wrote The Thin Man , he told me I was Nora , and I was very pleased , and then he told me I was also the silly girl in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry , and he was so handsome , and he called me " My darling Lilishka . " Did n't you , Dash ? Dash ? DASHIELL HAMMETT , apparently drunk , falls off the bar stool onto the floor. I met Hammett  --  Dashiell Hammett  --  in Musso and Frank 's Restaurant in Los Angeles in 1930 . He 'd written The Maltese Falcon and The Dain Curse . He was the hottest thing in town . When I met Hammett , I was a reader at MGM and did n't have a political bone in my body or a nickel to my name . When he got done with me , I was Lillian Hellman . On-screen we see the scene from Julia in which Jane Fonda , playing LILLIAN , is living with Jason Robards , playing DASHIELL HAMMETT . She 's trying to write . She types a few words on a piece of paper and then crumples it up . She tries again and crumples another piece of paper . Then she throws the typewriter out the window.That never happened . p. 21 MARY MCCARTHY Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hammett  --  you rarely slept together , he was drunk most of the time , and he had the longest writer 's block in living memory . LILLIAN HELLMAN He loved me and only me . MARY MCCARTHY I 'm sure he did . But this romantic thin man who rode into your life and turned you into a femme fatale was a figment of your imagination . He was just a story . LILLIAN HELLMAN If you want to believe that , it makes no difference to me . Because you do n't know the first thing about stories . If you did , you would n't do silly things like telling us there are no nightingales in North America . Fine , Hammett was just a story . And one day he gave me a book of British court cases and said , " Here 's something . " In it was an article about a girls ' school in Scotland where two headmistresses were accused by a student of having a lesbian relationship . The scandal forced the school to close , and the headmistresses sued the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd given me something that had structure , it had a subject  --  MARY MCCARTHY Its subject was lying  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN I called the play The Children 's Hour , and it was , for its time , shocking . It 's always nice to begin with something shocking . It 's a way of saying  --  A little Mae West . " I 'm here . Notice me , boys . Come over to my corner of the play-ground and I 'll show you my underpants . " I was a sensation , and I was twenty-nine . The BARTENDERS shake up a new round of drinks , and a man in a top hat enters and sits down next to MARY . He is high-waisted and slightly overweight . This is EDMUND WILSON . p. 22 MARY MCCARTHY WE SPOKE , WE DRANK , WE KNEW  --  BARTENDERS EDMUND WILSON APPEARS  --  MARY MCCARTHY THE SCENT OF DISASTERTHE CLINK OF A GLASS AND YOU BARTENDERS HE WAS OLD HE WAS NEW MARY MCCARTHY A VOICE LIKE MY OWN SAID " I DO " I WOKE , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life , really  --  I tried to figure out why I married Edmund Wilson . He was , of course , brilliant . Say something brilliant , Edmund . EDMUND WILSON Something brilliant . MARY MCCARTHY And he was famous for being a great deal of fun . Say something fun , Edmund . EDMUND WILSON Something fun . MARY MCCARTHY And he was eminent . And clever . And he was interested in all sorts of odd things . Puppets . He could take a bow tie and turn it into a tiny mouse  --  He turns a bow tie into a tiny mouse . EDMUND WILSON Squeak squeak . MARY MCCARTHY  --  and he had met Harry Houdini , and he could do magic tricks . EDMUND WILSON stands and removes his top hat and pulls a rabbit out of it . He exits with the rabbit.He was called Bunny , but not because of the rabbit . Indicating LILLIAN . She loved him . p. 23 LILLIAN HELLMAN I did . I did n't really know him until years later , but I absolutely adored him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIM DOWN ANYONE 'S THROAT MARY MCCARTHY THIS IS TRUE BARTENDERS AND MAY WE NOTE THAT WE KNEWAND ADORED HIM LILLIAN HELLMAN Everyone did . Everyone but you . MARY MCCARTHY Did you ever  --  ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Sleep with Edmund Wilson ? Absolutely not . Although I did sleep with Philip Rahv . Once . BARTENDERS SHE SLEPT WITH PHILIP RAHV MARY MCCARTHY Not even once . Beat . I was sleeping with Philip Rahv when I met Edmund Wilson . I was in love with Philip Rahv . LILLIAN HELLMAN No one remembers Philip Rahv . They all think you 're talking about Philip Roth . To the audience . It 's Philip Rahv  --  She mouths the words , " And I did sleep with him . " MARY MCCARTHY Philip Rahv was tall and handsome and about to become the editor of Partisan Review  --  and I was just starting to write criticism . We lived together in a one-room apartment , and we argued endlessly about everything . Whether Jews were superior to gentiles  --  which he believed , of course . It was as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing a small table.Jewish geniuses for five hundred dollars . p. 24 PHILIP RAHV A slight Russian accent . Einstein , Marx , Spinoza  --  MARY MCCARTHY Exactly . He was very intense . We waged class struggle every day . LILLIAN HELLMAN " My First Jew " by Mary McCarthy .

PHILIP RAHV Marcel Proust , Franz Kafka  --  MARY MCCARTHY I 'm not playing this game with you anymore  --  PHILIP RAHV Because you always lose . MARY MCCARTHY I do not always lose . How can I lose with Shakespeare on my team ? PHILIP RAHV But Sigmund Freud is not on your team  --  MARY MCCARTHY I 'm not playing , Philip  --  PHILIP RAHV Or Jascha Heifetz , or Vladimir Horowitz  --  MARY takes a particularly vicious cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A SMOKE MARY MCCARTHY A DRINK PHILIP RAHV A JEW A beat.What are you doing ? MARY MCCARTHY I 'm cutting the crusts off . PHILIP RAHV Do you know why you 're cutting the crusts off ? MARY MCCARTHY Because the sandwich tastes better with the crusts off  --  PHILIP RAHV shakes his head  --  that 's not the right answer.Because I grew up in a family where they cut the crusts off  --  Wrong answer again. I give up . PHILIP RAHV The reason people cut the crusts off bread is so they can throw the crusts away . Which shows the world that they have money , so much money they do n't even need the whole piece of bread . It 's a way for the middle-class goyim to pretend to be upper-class goyim  --  MARY MCCARTHY Interrupting . It makes the sandwiches look nicer . PHILIP RAHV It 's very bourgeois . MARY MCCARTHY Liking pretty things does n't make you bourgeois . PHILIP RAHV Caring about them does . He stands and picks up a pretty little vase with a few flowers in it . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch this  --  He starts across the room toward MARY and lets the vase fly out of his hand  --  MARY screams . MARY MCCARTHY Philip !  --  He catches the vase . PHILIP RAHV It 's just a possession . Possessions mean nothing . MARY MCCARTHY It was my grandmother 's . It 's practically all I have from my grandmother . PHILIP RAHV It 's a thing . It 's just a thing . Who needs it ? MARY MCCARTHY What would you suggest I put flowers in ? PHILIP RAHV Where is it written we have to have flowers ? MARY MCCARTHY Oh , I suppose there 's a Marxist position on flowers  --  PHILIP RAHV And as for linen napkins  --  He holds up a linen napkin . MARY MCCARTHY They were my grandmother 's  --  He picks up a silver fork . PHILIP RAHV And silver  --  He puts the fork back as MARY says : p. 27 MARY MCCARTHY The silver was  --  PHILIP AND MARY Together . My grandmother 's .

" PHILIP RAHV Fracturing the pronunciation . Voila yourself . A beat . MARY MCCARTHY Repeating his line . Voila now what comes out ? PHILIP RAHV Voila , scratch a goy and you find an anti-Semite . MARY MCCARTHY I am not an anti-Semite . That is so ludicrous . It 's all right for you to accuse me of being overly attached to meaningless objects , but when I suggest that your people are not exactly  --  p. 28 PHILIP RAHV My people . Oy , oy , oy , that 's good . My people are not exactly what ? Say it , go on  --  MARY MCCARTHY Your people  --  some of your people  --  some of your people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly living on bread and water  --  PHILIP RAHV But if they were , they would eat the crusts . He stands . Good-bye . I 'm going into the bathroom to stare at my foreskin . MARY MCCARTHY You do n't have a foreskin . PHILIP RAHV Exactly . PHILIP RAHV goes into the bathroom and slams the door . A beat . MARY MCCARTHY We were incredibly happy . She goes to the bureau and takes out a fox stole and wraps it around her neck . Re : the stole . My grandmother 's . Beat . One day Philip had a lunch for the great critic Edmund Wilson and took me to it . I wore my best black dress and a silver fox stole . He  --  Edmund  --  was short and stout and pink and pop-eyed , and he huffed and he puffed all the way through lunch . A few weeks later he took me to dinner . Here 's what I had for dinner : three daiquiris , two double Manhattans , a bottle of red wine , and several tumblers of B&amp;B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his house in Connecticut . I was shown to a guest bedroom . I decided to come down to the study where I knew he would be . It was late . There was a couch . He misunderstood why I had come , and took me in his arms , and I gave up the battle . p. 29 BARTENDERS A COUCH , A KISS , AND YOUTHE RAPTUROUS FORCEOF A FUTURE DIVORCEFOR TWOBEFORE IT BEGANIT WAS THROUGH LILLIAN HELLMAN You slept with him because you were drunk . MARY MCCARTHY That was n't the reason  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Why are you making this into the turning point of the twentieth century ? MARY MCCARTHY But I did n't come down to the study to sleep with him . And I tried to explain that to him later . Not that he cared  --  the only thing he cared about was that it had happened . I 'd slept with him , that was the fact , case closed . But I had n't gone there to sleep with him . I 'd gone there to talk to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to him . LILLIAN HELLMAN Listen to this , you wrote this : " She married him as a punishment for the sin of having slept with him when she did not love him , when she loved someone else . " MARY MCCARTHY I also wrote , " It made no sense for me to sleep with him , so I married him so it would make sense . " LILLIAN HELLMAN Bullshit . What about ambition ? What about vanity ? What about how pleased you had to have been that this brilliant man had chosen you ? Or did you think it was only because you were " a princess among the trolls " ? p. 30 MARY MCCARTHY I did n't write that about myself . I wrote it about a character in a short story . LILLIAN HELLMAN Dismissively . It was fiction . Hmmph . MARY MCCARTHY Yes . It was . LILLIAN HELLMAN You wrote fact and called it fiction  --  MARY MCCARTHY And you wrote fiction and called it fact . LILLIAN HELLMAN Ooh ooh ooh , that is so painful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been friends ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Hard to imagine . They both think about it for a moment.When would it have been ? MARY MCCARTHY Hard to imagine . Beat . But is n't it odd ? The two of us might never have become real writers if it were n't for these two older men who came into our lives at almost the same moment . After we were married , Edmund led me to a small guest bedroom on the ground floor of his house . There was a desk and a typewriter . He put me in that room and closed the door , and I became a writer . I wrote short stories , and they were published , and one of them was called " The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt . " It was about a young woman who meets a traveling salesman on a train , and they get drunk , and she wakes up naked in his sleeping berth . It was very shocking , it was , it was shocking , and because of it , I was a sensation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Hey , boys , come on over and I 'll show you my underpants . " MARY MCCARTHY Literally . In the story was a pair of underpants . LILLIAN HELLMAN With a safety pin in them . MARY MCCARTHY You read it ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Of course I read it . Everyone read it . MARY MCCARTHY Did you like it ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Did I like it ? After all those horrible things you said about me and my work ? MARY MCCARTHY I was just wondering what you thought of it . LILLIAN HELLMAN I liked it . I liked Memories of a Catholic Girlhood , too . MARY MCCARTHY Thank you . I liked The Children 's Hour . LILLIAN looks at her , surprised.Your plays were so well made . Too well made , really  --  there was way too much of the gun over the mantel in the first act being fired at the end of the play  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Let 's just go back to you liked it .

ANNOUNCER Are you now or have you ever been a member of the  --  MARY MCCARTHY Me ? Are you serious ? I was the palest of pinkos . I marched in the May Day parade in my prettiest dress . I became a Trotskyite almost by chance  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN No one here even knows what a Trotskyite is anymore  --  MARY MCCARTHY No one here knows what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell them what you believed  --  p. 34 LILLIAN HELLMAN I never said I was a Stalinist . MARY MCCARTHY You 're dead . Tell them . What can happen ? LILLIAN is n't going to admit it.All right , then : had you been a Stalinist , what might you have believed ? LILLIAN HELLMAN The Stalinists believed that a certain amount of bad stuff was part of any revolution , and that it would eventually stop . MARY MCCARTHY And the Trotskyites believed that bad stuff was bad stuff and would lead to more bad stuff . LILLIAN HELLMAN The Stalinists turned out to be wrong . MARY MCCARTHY So wrong . So very very wrong . LILLIAN HELLMAN I said they were wrong . MARY MCCARTHY And we turned out to be right . Beat . Anyway , how I became a Trotskyite . It was 1936 , I was living in New York , and everyone in New York was a leftist . I would never have made a true Marxist  --  it 's something you have to take up early , like ballet  --  but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaders of the Russian revolution , was accused of being a traitor , and thousands of people were sent to Siberia or executed for being in cahoots with him . It was a monstrous frame-up engineered by Joseph Stalin , it was completely unjust , but the truth is that when it began , I did n't know a thing about it because I was off in Reno , getting a divorce from my first husband . When I got back  --  We hear the sound of argument and see a Village party . There 's a table with bottles and paper cups and a group of men intensely talking . One of them is JAMES T. FARRELL. p. 35 JAMES T. FARRELL You ca n't mean it  --  MARY MCCARTHY That 's James T. Farrell , who wrote Studs Lonigan  --  JAMES T. FARRELL You ca n't possibly read what Trotsky wrote and think there 's any way he collaborated with the Germans  --  All the following partygoer dialogue is meant to overlap . PARTYGOER #1 But Holtzman testified he met with Trotsky at the Hotel Bristol in Copenhagen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground in 1912  --  PARTYGOER #3 So they could n't possibly have met at the Hotel Bristol  --  JAMES T. FARRELL He 's being framed and he deserves a hearing . Surely he deserves a hearing . Mary thinks so , do n't you , dear ? MARY MCCARTHY To the audience . I had no idea what they were talking about . To JAMES T. FARRELL . Come again ? JAMES T. FARRELL Trotsky  --  MARY MCCARTHY Trotsky  --  JAMES T. FARRELL Deserves a hearing . Do n't you think ? p. 36 MARY MCCARTHY Has something happened to Trotsky ? JAMES T. FARRELL Has something happened to Trotsky ? She wants to know if something has happened to Trotsky  --  MARY MCCARTHY I 'm sorry . JAMES T. FARRELL Trotsky 's been falsely accused of plotting with the Nazis to murder almost everyone in the Kremlin . Sixteen Bolsheviks have implicated him , and they 've all been executed . Trotsky denies the charges . So he deserves a hearing , right ? MARY MCCARTHY To the audience re : JAMES T. FARRELL . I liked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A hearing . Absolutely . Everyone deserves a hearing . JAMES T. FARRELL Not to mention asylum , do n't you think ? MARY MCCARTHY Once again this is a surprise , but she 's trying to bluff her way through as best she can . Asylum . Great idea . She and JAMES T. FARRELL toast . MARY walks away from the party.A few days later I opened the mail and found a letter from a group that was demanding Trotsky 's right to a hearing and to asylum , and my name was on the letterhead . No one had even asked me . They had no right . So I decided to remove my name from the list that very minute . And I meant to . Truly I did . But I forgot . And then , after a day or two , the phone rang . It was a Stalinist I barely knew , calling to persuade me to resign from this committee I had n't even joined . I hung up , and the phone rang again , and again . " You must withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think it over , Mary . " It made me very angry . So I never took my name off the list . And  --  Shrugs. that 's how I became a Trotskyite . I became a fanatic Trotskyite . I signed letters , I marched , I slept only with other Trotskyites  --  with a few exceptions  --  and I went to meetings where I was shouted down and accused of being the sort of person who " looked for pimples on the great smiling face of the Soviet Union . " p. 37 LILLIAN HELLMAN So you were an accidental Trotskyite , just as you were an accidental Mrs. Edmund Wilson . Just out of curiosity , what decisions in your life did you actually make ? MARY MCCARTHY What I believe is that the decisions we agonize over are often the most insignificant  --  what to have for dinner , beef or chicken . What color to make the rug . But the big things almost seem to choose you . I was like " Stendhal 's hero , who took part in something confused and disarrayed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no idea that I was making the most important decision of my life  --  to be serious , to be involved with public affairs , to be an intellectual . And I had no idea that I was choosing not just to be a Trotskyite but to be an anti-communist . Of course , I was n't a right-wing anti-communist like Senator McCarthy , I was a liberal , you understand the distinction  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Well , I do n't , as you know . I do n't understand that at all . Are you done ? MARY waves to LILLIAN to proceed.I do n't have a little story that makes my politics make sense . But there was nothing whimsical about my ending up where I did , even though it 's hard to be explicit about why . But I suppose  --  growing up in the South , seeing the way blacks were treated  --  well , that 's probably too simple . Once I was with Sophronia , and I refused to sit in the back of the bus . The driver threw us off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought I was showing off . p. 38 MARY MCCARTHY Ladies and gentlemen , Miss Rosa Parks  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN When I got older and realized I probably would never make much of a radical , I was nonetheless attracted to them . And then I got involved with Hammett , who was committed , no question , and we all hated the Nazis and we all cared about the workers . Beat . Too simple , too simple . And guilt , guilt played a part . Because I was successful during the Depression . Beat . And , of course , I 'd gone to Russia before the war , and it was hard to go there and not have feelings for the Russian people . They were our allies at the time . I wanted the revolution to work . Sue me . Beat . And I had a kind of impatience with splitting hairs with people who were always finding ways to get around believing in something , people who were looking for loopholes  --  MARY MCCARTHY Finding pimples  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Seizing on technicalities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something that was worth taking a position on . Which side are you on , boys , which side are you on . I did n't want to be on your side , quibbling  --  it seemed like quibbling  --  I wanted  --  p. 39 MARY MCCARTHY  --  to be one of the boys . LILLIAN HELLMAN We all wanted to be one of the boys . MARY MCCARTHY I never wanted to be one of the boys  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN But you wanted to be the only woman at the table , which is practically the same thing . I wanted to be brave . I wanted to be on the side of change and equality  --  MARY MCCARTHY We were for change and equality  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN But it did n't feel that way . It felt as if you were just a bunch of critics . Being against things was easy . I wanted to be for something . That was the hard part . MARY MCCARTHY So you overlooked " the bad stuff . " The technicalities . The purges , the murders , the Nazi-Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi-Soviet Pact ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Miss Hellman does not wish to discuss the Nazi-Soviet Pact  --  MARY MCCARTHY I know . And you never did . You just said , " We were wrong , " as if that was that , as if that took care of the fact that you looked the other way when it was all staring you in the face  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN You 're just angry because we became heroes  --  p. 40 MARY MCCARTHY What ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Think about it . It 's true . The war ended , the Russians were no longer our allies , I was blacklisted , thousands of people were blacklisted . And all of you  --  all of you who were so " right " about things did n't lift a finger to help . And then the House Un-American Activities Committee came along and gave us all a chance to do something brave . Beat . And I went there on that bad morning  --  MARY MCCARTHY In your Balmain dress  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Yes . In my Balmain dress and a brand-new hat and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARY MCCARTHY And lest anyone forget , she wrote an entire book about it . You 'd have thought the woman had gone to jail . Years later there was a play on Broadway  --  the testimony of the people who 'd appeared before the committee , all of it in the public record , and of course her statement was read , it was the high point of the play , and she actually asked to be paid for it . LILLIAN HELLMAN I did . And guess what ? They paid me ! She laughs . MARY laughs , too . A knock at the door . LILLIAN stands and goes over to a door . She opens it . A SUMMONS SERVER is there . p. 41 SUMMONS SERVER Are you Lillian Hellman ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Yes ? He hands her a subpoena . LILLIAN opens the envelope . Then she puts on her hat and her white kid gloves . ENSEMBLE GIVE US NAMESDO YOU SWEARARE YOU NOWDID YOU EVERTHE COMMITTEE IS IN ORDERGIVE US NAMESARE YOU NOWHAVE YOU EVER EVER BEENSTATE YOUR NAMESO HELP YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Communist Party ? LILLIAN HELLMAN From her letter to the committee . " I am not willing , now or in the future , to bring bad trouble to people who , in my past association with them , were completely innocent of any talk or any action that was disloyal or subversive . To hurt innocent people whom I knew many years ago in order to save myself is , to me , inhuman and indecent and dishonorable . I can not and will not cut my conscience to fit this year 's fashions , even though I long ago came to the conclusion that I was not a political person and could have no comfortable place in any political group . I would , therefore , like to come before you and speak of myself . I am prepared to tell you anything you wish to know about my views or actions if your Committee will agree to refrain from asking me to name other people . If the Committee is unwilling to give me this assurance , I will be forced to plead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY yanks at the red parachute drop , and it vanishes . p. 42 p. 43 Act 1 , Scene 5 Scene 5 What happened at Sarah Lawrence . MARY emerges from the wings , pulling a rope that brings a porch onto the stage . LILLIAN HELLMAN What 's this ? MARY MCCARTHY Sarah Lawrence College . You skipped right over it . LILLIAN HELLMAN It was n't that important . MARY MCCARTHY It 's where we met . LILLIAN HELLMAN Referring to her letter to the committee . As far as I 'm concerned , that was the first-act curtain . MARY MCCARTHY But first Sarah Lawrence . It 's 1948 . LILLIAN HELLMAN I suppose I have to get the tea . MARY MCCARTHY I got the porch . LILLIAN goes offstage and returns pushing a table with a large silver tea service of cups and saucers . MARY arranges the women in the ENSEMBLE . She calls in HAROLD TAYLOR and places him to the right of LILLIAN 'S chair . LILLIAN HELLMAN There were many more people than this . MARY MCCARTHY We do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then use some of the men to fill in . Some of the men in the ENSEMBLE sit with the women.Where was I ? MARY MCCARTHY Over there . LILLIAN walks to her chair.Are you ready ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Are you ready ? MARY MCCARTHY All right . Stephen Spender invited us to speak  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN I do n't think so . Harold Taylor , the president of Sarah Lawrence , invited us to speak . Not that it matters . MARY MCCARTHY You 're talking to the students when I come in . Stephen is there . STEPHEN SPENDER waves hello.You 're out on the sunporch at the president 's house  --  STEPHEN SPENDER No , no , that 's not right  --  MARY and LILLIAN look at STEPHEN SPENDER.It was n't at the president 's house  --  MARY MCCARTHY Where was it , then ? STEPHEN SPENDER It was at my house  --  MARY MCCARTHY On Stephen Spender 's sunporch , then  --  STEPHEN SPENDER We did n't have a sunporch. p. 45 MARY MCCARTHY It was definitely on a sunporch . So it must have been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was at my house  --  LILLIAN stands . LILLIAN HELLMAN Never mind . What am I saying ? MARY MCCARTHY You 're talking about John Dos Passos . As LILLIAN sits back down : LILLIAN HELLMAN You have to explain who John Dos Passos is  --  STEPHEN SPENDER By way of explanation . A famous novelist and radical  --  MARY MCCARTHY You were saying that John Dos Passos had gone to Spain during the Spanish civil war and turned against the loyalist cause because he did n't like the food in Madrid . And you did n't notice me , probably because I looked quite young at the time . I could n't bear it . All those lies , so smooth , as if they were coming out of a tube . And you were so clever . You were n't being hostile at all . " Oh , that Dos , " you were saying  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Repeating . " Oh , that Dos . " Like that ? MARY MCCARTHY Just like that . " He did love his food . " p. 46 LILLIAN HELLMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY MCCARTHY Is it coming back to you ? LILLIAN HELLMAN No . It does n't sound like me at all . MARY MCCARTHY And I interrupted . And I said  --  To the STUDENTS , heatedly . " John Dos Passos did n't turn against the loyalists , he turned against the communists . And it was n't because of the food in Madrid  --  it was because one of his closest friends in Spain , an incredibly brave man named Andres Nin , had just been tortured and murdered in a communist prison by Stalinists , that 's why . " She has moved herself to tears . LILLIAN HELLMAN Were you actually crying ? MARY MCCARTHY I was very upset . And then you jangled the bracelets  --  MARY signals for the bracelets to descend . They do . LILLIAN looks up to see them . LILLIAN HELLMAN But I never wore bracelets . MARY MCCARTHY Of course you wore bracelets . LILLIAN HELLMAN You must have me confused with someone else . MARY MCCARTHY There are pictures of you wearing bracelets  --  p. 47 LILLIAN HELLMAN Nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanish . STEPHEN SPENDER Thinking it over . I 'm starting to wonder if I was even there  --  MARY MCCARTHY Of course you were there  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Maybe he was n't  --  STEPHEN SPENDER To MARY . I do remember that afterwards she said we 'd arranged the entire episode so we could red-bait her . MARY MCCARTHY Well , how could we have red-baited her ? How could we have arranged for her to say something so perfectly idiotic ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Are you the only person who 's allowed to say that people sometimes do serious things for shallow reasons ? MARY MCCARTHY But in his case , it was n't true . LILLIAN HELLMAN How do you know ? How do we know why anyone does anything ? In real life , I mean . STEPHEN SPENDER If I could just throw something in here that is only going to confuse things , I 'm afraid . A few months earlier , before any of this happened , I had dinner with John Dos Passos . He had been in England , which had just elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer believed in socialism because he 'd gone to a restaurant in London and found a bug in his chicken . A beat . p. 48 LILLIAN HELLMAN A bad moment for your team . MARY MCCARTHY Thank you , Stephen . Thank you for that . STEPHEN SPENDER It does n't mean your version is n't accurate  --  MARY MCCARTHY It 's not " my version . " It 's what happened . LILLIAN HELLMAN It 's not what happened . STEPHEN SPENDER What do you think happened ? LILLIAN HELLMAN What do I think happened ? I thought you 'd never ask . She stands and moves some of the furniture around . I was here . She sits down . Harold  --  you 're next to me . And the sunlight was coming into the room , like so  --  A light hits her . Even more sunlight . The light gets a little brighter . Lovely . And the students were sitting on the floor , because so many of them had turned up to see me that there were n't enough chairs  --  The STUDENTS sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at me like little fish  --  no , like baby birds in a nest , waiting to be fed  --  She motions to the STUDENTS to tilt their chins upward slightly . When I suddenly noticed  --  over there  --  She motions to MARY to move to the other side of the room . MARY crosses and the STUDENTS turn to watch her.The students never took their eyes off me  --  The STUDENTS turn back to LILLIAN .  --  a quivering dark cylinder of rage . To the lighting person . Even darker . The light on MARY dims . She was holding a teacup and saucer  --  MARY is handed a teacup and saucer , or perhaps a teacup and saucer are lowered from the ceiling on a hook.I was talking . I 'd been asked a question  --  A STUDENT raises her hand . p. 49 STUDENT Did you ever meet Ernest Hemingway ? LILLIAN HELLMAN " Did I ever meet Ernest Hemingway ? " And I was answering . I was saying To the STUDENTS . I would have starved to death in Spain but for Ernest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the war , he said to me , " Bring food , there 's none . " And when he and I had dinner in Madrid , in someone 's apartment , I brought sardines and pate . And Ernest said thank God I had , because Dos Passos had just been there and had n't brought any food at all and ended up eating everyone else 's . That 's what I said , it was completely harmless , and Madam over there began shaking  --  you could hear her teacup rattling against the saucer . To MARY . Go ahead . I did your version . Do mine . MARY starts shaking her teacup against her saucer.And she said  --  MARY MCCARTHY How can you say that about Dos ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Dos . So she would be sure I would know she knew him . " How can you say that about Dos ? " What had I said ? And perhaps I said something like " Well , Dos loved his food , " and she reacted quite bizarrely . She said  --  MARY MCCARTHY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because you ca n't stand that he went over to the other side  --  p. 50 LILLIAN HELLMAN Good . Keep shaking the cup . MARY MCCARTHY You 're just saying that because you 've never admitted what the Stalinists did in Spain  --  MARY continues , overlapping with LILLIAN . LILLIAN HELLMAN I had no idea what was going on . I turned to the president of the school and said  --  Turning to one of the people in the room . " Who is that girl ? " And he said  --  PRESIDENT Mary McCarthy . LILLIAN HELLMAN And I said " Oh . " I said , " Oh , the one who married Edmund Wilson for his looks . " And some of the students laughed  --  the ones who knew what Edmund Wilson looked like  --  Many of the students laugh . So does LILLIAN.And she dropped her cup and saucer on the floor  --  MARY MCCARTHY What ? LILLIAN HELLMAN And they shattered into a million tiny pieces . MARY MCCARTHY Never happened  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Go ahead , do it  --  MARY drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break into tiny pieces.And Harold Taylor 's maid came rushing in to sweep it up . p. 51 MARY MCCARTHY I knew a black maid would enter the scene . To the audience . She could never write a play that did n't have a black maid in it , speaking in the most appalling way  --  BLACK MAID Lawd , Lawd , Lawd , it ai n't right to let young ' uns use the good china , Mistah Taylor . Ah tol ' you this would happen  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Actually , the maid said nothing . MARY MCCARTHY Well , had she spoken , that 's the sort of thing you would have had her say . STEPHEN SPENDER I do n't remember any of this . Where was I ? LILLIAN HELLMAN You were n't there , Stephen . We went to your house afterwards . To MARY . You came to pick a fight . Why ? Was it because I slept with Philip Rahv ? MARY MCCARTHY You never slept with Philip Rahv  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Fine . Scratch Philip Rahv as a possible explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jealous ? Of what ? LILLIAN HELLMAN I know . What can it be ? Not my looks , certainly . So : my money ? My fame ? My farm ! ? Tell the truth , you always wanted a farm  --  p. 52 MARY MCCARTHY I am not a jealous person . LILLIAN HELLMAN Nor am I. MARY MCCARTHY It 's just too easy to say that the reason women fight with each other is because they 're jealous . LILLIAN HELLMAN Absolutely . We had plenty of reasons to dislike each other . Good reasons . MARY MCCARTHY Real reasons . I 'm just not a jealous person . LILLIAN HELLMAN Hmmmph . MARY MCCARTHY Although I have to say I have never known a jealous person who admitted to being a jealous person . LILLIAN HELLMAN Neither have I. They nod . A small moment between them , perhaps . STEPHEN SPENDER Trying to find some common ground . So are we in agreement about something ? MARY MCCARTHY We are . LILLIAN HELLMAN We had a fight . MARY MCCARTHY Exactly . LILLIAN HELLMAN And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You dined out on it for years  --  p. 53 LILLIAN HELLMAN Imitating MARY . " I was so young , she thought I was a student "  --  MARY MCCARTHY " They came there to red-bait me "  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN " Dos "  --  MARY MCCARTHY " Ernest "  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Was there ever a moment we could have been friends ? MARY MCCARTHY Friends ? Hard to imagine . STEPHEN SPENDER Ladies ! Ladies ! MARY MCCARTHY We had a fight . LILLIAN HELLMAN A skirmish , really . MARY MCCARTHY And the captain of the first U-boat straightened her stockings and drove back to her home . LILLIAN HELLMAN And the captain of the second U-boat straightened her stockings and drove back to her farm . Which was a farm . A woman enters from the wings . This is MURIEL GARDINER . MURIEL GARDINER Oh . Am I in the right place ? MARY MCCARTHY Hello . You 're early . I did n't expect you for an hour  --  MURIEL GARDINER I know .

UNCLE MYERS comes back out of the house with the strop.Mary  --  MARY MCCARTHY Yes , Uncle  --  UNCLE MYERS Are you sure you have n't seen the butterfly ? MARY MCCARTHY Of course I 'm sure .

UNCLE MYERS Well , someone took your brother 's butterfly and hid it under your plate  --  MARY MCCARTHY It was n't me . Why would I do that ? UNCLE MYERS You wanted the butterfly  --  MARY MCCARTHY But why would I take it and put it under my own plate ? MARY starts to run away , and UNCLE MYERS grabs her . UNCLE MYERS Admit you took it  --  MARY MCCARTHY I will never admit I took it . You can beat me until I 'm dead , but I will never admit I took it . Never ever . She squirms out of his grasp and runs into the house . He runs after her . The door slams behind him . We ca n't see them , but we can hear that he 's caught her and has begun to beat her . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the house . As she comes up the stairs , she hears MARY screaming . She stops . She puts her hand up to her ear in a sort of exaggerated listening pose . Then she marches up and bangs on the door . LILLIAN HELLMAN Hey , what 's going on in there ? She knocks louder . Open up ! And stop doing whatever it is you 're doing , or I 'll call the police and you 'll go to jail for the rest of your life ! The beating continues , and we hear MARY screaming in pain . LILLIAN kicks down the door like John Wayne and reaches in for UNCLE MYERS . She hauls him out by his suspenders ( it 's an UNCLE MYERS doll ) and flings him down the porch stairs . She leaps down the stairs after him , takes the strop from his hand , and beats him with it.You 're a bad , bad person , Uncle Myers  --  She picks him up again and flings him offstage . MARY appears in the doorway.Run , Mary , run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? They look around . LILLIAN HELLMAN We 'll hide . We 'll hide in this fig tree until we figure out what we 're doing . The two of them scramble up the fig tree . A beat . The branches open , and we see them now . MARY MCCARTHY I ca n't believe you did that . LILLIAN HELLMAN I 'm amazingly strong for my age . MARY shakes her head in wonderment.I saved you . MARY MCCARTHY Hey , wait a minute . It was my uncle , and my house  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN What are friends for ? MARY MCCARTHY  --  and my story . And now you 're the queen of it . You 're always doing that ! LILLIAN HELLMAN Doing what ? MARY MCCARTHY You always take over  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN I do not . MARY MCCARTHY You do , too . LILLIAN HELLMAN No I do n't  --  MARY MCCARTHY Yes you do . Look at us  --  we 're hiding in your fig tree . Guess what ? There are no fig trees in Minneapolis !

But famous . Beat . In 1963 I published a best-seller called The Group . It was made into a movie . It was a novel about a group of women who 'd gone to Vassar together  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN  --  viciously reviewed by some of your closest friends . In 1969 I published my first memoir  --  MARY MCCARTHY You were washed up as a playwright  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN It was a best-seller called An Unfinished Woman  --  MARY MCCARTHY I went to Vietnam and wrote about the war  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN No one read it . I wrote another best-selling memoir called Pentimento . MARY MCCARTHY " Pentimento " is Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just made it up . " p. 65 LILLIAN HELLMAN A chapter in it , called " Julia , " was made into a movie  --  MARY MCCARTHY We 'll get to that shortly . I went to Washington to write about Watergate  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Did you ? I 'd forgotten that if I ever knew it . I wrote another best-seller about the McCarthy period . It was called Scoundrel Time  --  MARY MCCARTHY  --  in which you canonized yourself . I lived in Europe with my fourth husband , and I really did n't think about you much at all . I mention this because people are going to think we spent our lives thinking about each other  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN We did n't . Whole years passed when I did n't think of you at all . You were , after all , gone . MARY MCCARTHY I was in Paris . LILLIAN HELLMAN A diplomat 's wife . Passing out cheese puffs for the deputy consul of the Norwegian Embassy . MARY MCCARTHY I was madly in love . LILLIAN HELLMAN Always a mistake to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York City . Always a mistake to choose love over your career  --  MARY MCCARTHY I did n't give up my career  --  p. 66 LILLIAN HELLMAN But you gave up the world you were part of . It was an awful world , worth giving up , but it was the world you 'd lived in your entire writing life . While I stayed in the thick of things  --  MARY MCCARTHY And became a celebrity . LILLIAN HELLMAN Well , do n't say it as if you did n't want a piece of it . You even did a People magazine interview . " America 's first lady of letters , " in People magazine . MARY MCCARTHY I was trying to sell a book . LILLIAN HELLMAN And you took a pop at me in People magazine . The interviewer asked you , " What do you have against Lillian Hellman ? " Implicitly saying , " Why keep attacking her ? " Why did you ? MARY MCCARTHY Because you were such a fraud . LILLIAN HELLMAN Nonsense . You were just using me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you that I stayed as famous as I did , or you 'd have to have found someone else to attack . You virtually sharpened your tongue on my reputation . I was your whetstone . I was part of your routine . " What do you have against Lillian Hellman ? " And you answered  --  MARY MCCARTHY " Well , I never liked what she writes . " p. 67 LILLIAN HELLMAN But it turned out you had n't seen most of my plays , and you had n't read my books , either  --  MARY MCCARTHY I 'd read as much of them as I could . I read that silly story in Pentimento about the turtle  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN What was wrong with the story about the turtle ? MARY MCCARTHY Who could believe a word of it ? You and Hammett kill a turtle , you slice its head off , you leave it in the kitchen to be made into soup , and it somehow manages to resurrect itself and crawl away . The next day , when it turns up dead somewhere on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastically elliptical , cutthroat debate over whether the turtle is  --  correct me if I 'm putting words into your mouth here  --  some sort of amphibious reincarnation of Jesus . LILLIAN HELLMAN Everyone liked that story . MARY MCCARTHY Every word of dialogue in it is cocked up , but of course there 's no way to prove it because everyone is dead , including the turtle . You never wrote about anyone until they were dead and were no longer around to correct you  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN And you never wrote about anyone unless they were alive and you could hurt their feelings . You barely even bothered to change anyone 's name . A beat . p. 68 MARY MCCARTHY We always end up this way  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN On opposite sides . A beat . MARY MCCARTHY And yet  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN What ? MARY MCCARTHY We both loved beautiful things  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN And we were n't ashamed of it . We both loved cooking  --  MARY MCCARTHY Yes , I always heard you were a wonderful cook  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN I was . Beat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARY MCCARTHY You thought you could feed the beast forever . Even bigger mistake . VOICES FROM WINGS Miss Hellman , Miss Hellman , Miss Hellman  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN I ca n't talk about this right now . I 'm late for my interview . Could I have some coffee ? MARY MCCARTHY Un caf , s'il vous plat . LILLIAN is surrounded by interviewers with cameras . MARY sits at a table in a Paris caf on the other side of the stage and opens a book . LILLIAN turns from one interviewer to the next and smiles as she 's bombarded with questions . p. 69 INTERVIEWER #1 Miss Hellman , tell me about the fig tree  --  INTERVIEWER #2 Miss Hellman , did Hammett help you with your writing ? INTERVIEWER #1 , #2 , AND #3 Together . Tell us  --  INTERVIEWER #1  --  about Sophronia  --  INTERVIEWER #2  --  about your imaginary playmate  --  INTERVIEWER #3  --  what " pentimento " means  --  INTERVIEWER #1 This ad  --  advertising ranch mink  --  what in the world is that about ? LILLIAN HELLMAN I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scrim we see a photograph of LILLIAN as the legend in the " What Becomes a Legend Most " Blackglama mink ad , as LILLIAN poses and preens for the camera and the photographers shout  --  INTERVIEWER #1 This way  --  INTERVIEWER #2 This way  --  INTERVIEWER #3 Over here  --  INTERVIEWER #1 I want to know why you did that ad . LILLIAN HELLMAN Laughs . I got talked into it one bad afternoon . Why ? Do you object to it ? p. 70 INTERVIEWER #1 No , but I do n't quite know what to make of it . LILLIAN HELLMAN I do n't blame you . LILLIAN now sits for a television interview , smoking a cigarette . We see her image projected onto the scrim behind her as the interview progresses . INTERVIEWER #1 Miss Hellman , the story of you and your friend Julia is about to be made into a movie . Tell us about her . LILLIAN HELLMAN Julia was a childhood friend who moved to Vienna to study with Freud and became active in the anti-fascist underground . In 1936 she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars  --  to Berlin . INTERVIEWER #1 Money that was to be used to save people from the Nazis . LILLIAN HELLMAN Yes . She knew that I was afraid of being afraid and might be willing to do something dangerous . So I brought her the money . INTERVIEWER #1 In the lining of a fur hat . LILLIAN HELLMAN Yes . I met Julia in a restaurant near the Berlin train station I knew she 'd been wounded in a demonstration , but when I saw her , and I saw the crutches , I realized she 'd lost a leg . INTERVIEWER #1 Did you ever see her alive after that day ? p. 71 LILLIAN HELLMAN Never . She was murdered by the Nazis . I went to London and brought her body home to America . She 'd left her daughter for safekeeping with friends in Alsace , and I never went looking for her  --  INTERVIEWER #1 Her daughter , Lilly . LILLIAN HELLMAN Yes . I suffered terribly for not looking for the child . Hammett always said I got my worst nightmares from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . This has never happened to me . All the technicians and makeup people rush in with boxes of Kleenex . LILLIAN dries her eyes , and more makeup is applied . INTERVIEWER #1 Are you all right , Miss Hellman ? Do you want to stop  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN No . I 'll be fine . And now we see MARY , in the caf in Paris , being interviewed by a very young REPORTER with a very low-tech tape recorder . This PARIS REPORTER puts a cassette into the recorder and presses record . PARIS REPORTER Just a second . Into the machine . Testing one two three four . Sorry about this . I always do this because I 'm sure it 's not going to work . The PARIS REPORTER presses the rewind button , and the machine rewinds . The PARIS REPORTER presses the play button . The machine says : " Testing one two three four . " I once interviewed Leslie Caron , and the machine did n't work , so I lost the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case , but then I usually forget to take notes . Pressing the record button . All right . All set . Picks up the recorder to make sure the tape is spinning , sets it down . You are not at all what I imagined  --  p. 72 MARY MCCARTHY Really . What did you imagine ? PARIS REPORTER I do n't know . I mean , I saw Julia recently . MARY MCCARTHY Who is Julia ? PARIS REPORTER The movie . It 's based on this Lillian Hellman story . Jane Fonda , Jason Robards . And I thought you were going to be more like  --  MARY MCCARTHY Like Jane Fonda ? PARIS REPORTER No , no . But  --  MARY MCCARTHY Surely not like Lillian Hellman ? PARIS REPORTER I do n't know . You 're so ladylike you 'd hardly guess you 're Mary McCarthy , if you know what I mean . MARY lights a cigarette.Cigarettes . That 's more like it . Fumbling with the notebook . I guess you did n't see Julia . MARY MCCARTHY No , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about how Lillian Hellman smuggled all this money into Germany in a fur hat and saved people from the Nazis . MARY MCCARTHY Mmmmmmm . PARIS REPORTER Did you read Scoundrel Time ? p. 73 MARY MCCARTHY No although I did read about it  --  PARIS REPORTER She stood up to Senator McCarthy , you know . She was the only one , really . She said , " I can not fit my conscience into your expectations . " Something like that . MARY exhales smoke straight at the reporter.What do you think of her ? MARY MCCARTHY Lillian Hellman ? I ca n't stand her . She smiles . PARIS REPORTER Really ? Gosh . Why ? MARY MCCARTHY I first met her at Sarah Lawrence  --  To the audience . Blah blah blah  --  Back to the PARIS REPORTER . John Dos Passos  --  Back to the audience . Blah blah blah  --  Back to the PARIS REPORTER . D-O-S P-A-S-S-O-S . Two " S 's "  --  PARIS REPORTER Thank you . MARY MCCARTHY did n't like the food in Madrid  --  Back to the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was just brainwashing those girls  --  it was really vicious . And so somebody like that writes a book like Scoundrel Time , and I think that it 's still scoundrel time as far as she 's concerned . It 's as if she thinks she 's the only person who behaved morally during the McCarthy period . Everything she writes is false , including " and " and " but . " MARY smiles again . Big smile this time , the smile you smile when you say something funny for the very first time and it 's a surprise to you . The PARIS REPORTER looks down at the tape recorder to make sure it 's working.Is that working ? p. 74 PARIS REPORTER Yes . MARY MCCARTHY Good . The PARIS REPORTER exits and we 're now in New York . MARY 's college friend ABBY KAISER sits down . Like MARY , she is dressed like a garden-club matron . ABBY KAISER How 's it going ? MARY MCCARTHY No one 's said a thing . Never a good sign , I 'm afraid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to be on Dick Cavett . He 's going to do two shows . ABBY KAISER Two ! Oh , Mary , that will help , wo n't it ? MARY MCCARTHY Let 's hope so . Does anyone watch it ? ABBY KAISER Less so now that it 's on public television , but the advantage is that everyone who watches it buys books , so you 're reaching the people you want to , the core audience , I think it 's called . What are you going to say ? MARY MCCARTHY I do n't know . I have to come up with something clever , I suppose . ABBY KAISER You always say the cleverest things  --  MARY MCCARTHY You think they 're clever . ABBY KAISER They are clever . They 're famously clever . p. 75 MARY MCCARTHY I did an interview in Paris a few months ago  --  ABBY KAISER I saw it . In that little English-language newspaper . MARY MCCARTHY You saw it ? ABBY KAISER Someone sent it to me . Someone I know who knows I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . MARY MCCARTHY It was not a very nice article . ABBY KAISER I know . MARY MCCARTHY The writer kept comparing me to Lillian Hellman . I had no idea that 's what he was going to do . All about dashing Lillian Hellman and frumpy me . ABBY KAISER Can you imagine ? Well , you ca n't let things like that bother you . MARY MCCARTHY Oh , I do n't , really . Beat . He wrote that I looked like a garden-club matron . Beat . But I said something funny in it , I think . About Lillian Hellman . I said , " Everything she writes is false , including ' and ' and ' but . ' " ABBY KAISER Yes , that is funny . And clever . " Everything she writes is false , including ' and ' and ' but . ' " That 's good , Mary . MARY MCCARTHY Do you think I should say it ? On Dick Cavett ? p. 76 ABBY KAISER Sure . How do you do that ? MARY MCCARTHY Do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pop it in ? MARY MCCARTHY Dick Cavett has to ask me a question that it 's the answer to . ABBY KAISER How do you get him to do that ? MARY MCCARTHY They call you ahead of time and ask you what you want to talk about . ABBY KAISER Oh , is that how they do it ? I 'm so stupid . So he says , " What do you think of Lillian Hellman ? " Like it just crossed his mind ? MARY MCCARTHY Well , that 's a little obvious . More like " What writers do you think are overrated ? " or something . ABBY KAISER And then you can say , " Lillian Hellman , everything she writes is false , including ' and ' and ' but . ' " Amazing . I had no idea . A beat . MARY MCCARTHY Do you think I should say , " Everything she writes is false , including ' and ' and ' but , ' " or should I say , " Everything she writes is false , including ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gosh , I do n't know . They 're not too different . MARY MCCARTHY Trying them both . Everything she writes is false , including " and " and " but . " Everything she writes is false , including " and " and " the . " Beat . I think if I say " ' and ' and ' but , ' " people might be confused by the word " but , " but if I say " ' and ' and ' the ' "  --  I mean , obviously I 'd have to pronounce it " the "  --  Sounding like " thee . "  --  as opposed to " the "  --  Sounding like " thuh. "  --  so people will be able to hear what I 'm saying  --  Beat . I do n't want to have to make little quote marks with my fingers . p. 77 ABBY KAISER I always do that . MARY MCCARTHY " The " is better , I think . It 's so much more devoid of meaning than " but , " if you see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She makes little quote marks and laughs . MARY MCCARTHY Do you think " Everything she writes is false " or " Everything she writes is a lie "  --  ABBY KAISER Including " ' and ' and ' the ' " or " ' and ' and ' but ' " ? MARY MCCARTHY Trying out other possibilities . " Everything she writes " ? " Every word she writes " ? A pause while MARY thinks about this . ABBY KAISER What are you wearing ? MARY MCCARTHY I do n't know . Probably something matronly . They both laugh . ABBY KAISER Are you nervous ? MARY MCCARTHY No , of course not . It 's just a television show that almost no one watches , right ? ABBY KAISER Absolutely . p. 78 Act 2 , Scene 4 Scene 4 The Dick Cavett Show . January 25 , 1980 MARY is being interviewed by DICK CAVETT . Her image is projected on the scrim behind her . On the other side of the stage , a television set hangs from the ceiling over a bed . LILLIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette . LILLIAN HELLMAN I was watching , you know . I saw you say it . She climbs into the bed . We see the bed from the back , so that what we mostly see is a headboard with a curl of smoke rising above it . DICK CAVETT Are there any writers you think are overrated ? MARY MCCARTHY The only one I can think of is a holdover like Lillian Hellman , who I think is tremendously overrated , a bad writer , a dishonest writer , but she really belongs to the past . DICK CAVETT What is so dishonest about her ? MARY MCCARTHY Everything . But I said once in some interview that every word she writes is a lie , including " and " and " the . " And now LILLIAN rises up in the bed like Frumasera , and we have some fantastic visual effect of a giant black beast rising up and causing a BLACKOUT . p. 79 Act 2 , Scene 5 Scene 5 Voila . We hear a doorbell ringing , and now we see the suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opens it . A SUMMONS SERVER stands there . SUMMONS SERVER Madame Mary McCarthy ? MARY MCCARTHY Oui ? SUMMONS SERVER Voila . He hands her the summons . She looks at it . BLACKOUT . p. 80 Act 2 , Scene 6 Scene 6 Imaginary friends . The fig tree again . The ENSEMBLE sings a reprise of " Fig Tree Rag .

She sits on the front porch and takes out a fan and starts to fan herself with it . The branches of the fig tree part , and we see LILLIAN and MARY sitting in it . MARY MCCARTHY Very Tennessee Williams . LILLIAN HELLMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just seems derivative . LILLIAN HELLMAN But it 's a hot day  --  MARY MCCARTHY Lose the fan . MAX HELLMAN , LILLIAN ' s father , comes from around the back of the house and looks at FIZZY as she sits there . FIZZY turns and sees him . She drops the fan with a huge clatter . MAX HELLMAN tips his hat . p. 81 FIZZY Max ! What a surprise . When did you get back ? MAX HELLMAN Train just got in . Beautiful morning , is n't it ? Even prettier now that I see you . MARY MCCARTHY You know what I have never understood ? Why is no one Jewish in your plays ? MAX HELLMAN Singing and davening . Oy oy oy oy oy  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Like that ? MARY MCCARTHY No , not like that  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN We did n't really think of ourselves as Jews . We thought of ourselves as southerners  --  MARY MCCARTHY Yes , and here comes a perfect example of it  --  MAX HELLMAN What were you thinking about ? FIZZY Just now ? Summertime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to sit still as statues on the stone bench and see if we could get the birds to buzz around our heads . Once I put a piece of honeysuckle in my mouth  --  MAX HELLMAN suddenly kisses FIZZY , a long , passionate kiss . MARY MCCARTHY The kiss , on the other hand , is good , if only because it gets her to stop talking . p. 82 LILLIAN HELLMAN I give up . You write the scene . MARY MCCARTHY All right . I will . MARY and LILLIAN cover themselves with the branches of the fig tree . MAX HELLMAN and FIZZY stop kissing . FIZZY slaps MAX HELLMAN . MAX HELLMAN Fizzy ? Why did you do that ? FIZZY I 'm practically not speaking to you , Max Hellman . MAX HELLMAN Why , Fizzy ? Tell me ? FIZZY shakes her head.Come on , tell me . He touches her gently . She softens.Come on . FIZZY You said you 'd send me a postcard from Chicago and you did n't  --  MAX HELLMAN How could I send you a postcard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  FIZZY I know . She spies on me when I 'm getting dressed , and she tells lies , too , Max , she tells lies all the time , everything she says is a lie , including  --  The branches in the tree start to rustle wildly . LILLIAN HELLMAN I hate you ! MARY MCCARTHY I hate you ! p. 83 LILLIAN HELLMAN I hate you more ! MARY MCCARTHY I hate you more ! And both of them fall out of the tree . Splat . FIZZY screams and runs off . The MAN playing MAX HELLMAN is left onstage with the two dolls . He takes off his MAX HELLMAN costume and starts to sing " I Would but I Ca n't .

We see LILLIAN and MARY . Both of them are older now . MARY MCCARTHY Hellman versus McCarthy . LILLIAN HELLMAN It was huge . MARY MCCARTHY She sued me for two million dollars . LILLIAN HELLMAN Two point two five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page of The New York Times . LILLIAN HELLMAN They called all my old enemies . MARY MCCARTHY And mine , who were suddenly my friends . LILLIAN HELLMAN At some point Norman Mailer got involved . NORMAL MAILER enters . NORMAN MAILER If I may  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Get out of here , Norman  --  MARY MCCARTHY At the same time . Go away . As NORMAN MAILER disappears.He wrote an article  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN In The New York Times Book Review  --  p. 86 MARY MCCARTHY I knew he would be on my side . LILLIAN HELLMAN And I knew he would be on mine . MARY MCCARTHY But he attacked us both . LILLIAN HELLMAN He said you were stupid to have said what you did . MARY MCCARTHY He said you should drop the lawsuit . LILLIAN HELLMAN I stopped speaking to him . MARY MCCARTHY So did I. LILLIAN HELLMAN And I certainly did n't drop the lawsuit . MARY MCCARTHY Although you offered to if I took it all back . Your lawyer had lunch with my lawyer  --  MARY walks over to a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her LAWYER . MARY 'S LAWYER I had lunch with her lawyer . MARY MCCARTHY Milk or lemon ? MARY 'S LAWYER Neither . Look , Mary , you do n't want to go to court with this . Just to answer the papers she filed will cost thousands and thousands of dollars . So if you 're willing to say something in the form of a retraction  --  MARY MCCARTHY Something like what ? She passes a tray of cookies. p. 87 MARY 'S LAWYER Something like " I did n't mean to suggest that Lillian Hellman was a liar . " MARY MCCARTHY But I did . MARY 'S LAWYER I know you did . But just say it . MARY MCCARTHY But it would n't be true  --  MARY 'S LAWYER Everyone will understand  --  MARY MCCARTHY Every day I get another letter from someone documenting yet another lie . Do you know what Gore Vidal said about her and Dashiell Hammett ? He said , " Did anyone ever see them together ? " MARY 'S LAWYER You ca n't win the case by proving she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lies . I am pinning them , like dead butterflies , on a wall of cotton . A beat . MARY 'S LAWYER So I should call and say you wo n't apologize . MARY MCCARTHY Never ever . I 'm not sorry I said it , I 'm not . I 'm sorry it did n't sell more copies of my book . I 'm sorry it will bankrupt me . And I 'm sorry about the sleepless nights  --  She lights a cigarette ; then , re : the cigarette.  --  one of my three a day  --  MARY 'S LAWYER Some people love sleepless nights . Some people thrive on litigation . p. 88 MARY MCCARTHY Presumably they 're people with more than sixty-three thousand dollars in the bank . In case anyone asks , tell them I 'm sleeping like a baby . I ca n't apologize . I did n't do anything wrong . MARY 'S LAWYER But you 'd just be saying it to make it go away . Everyone will understand . MARY MCCARTHY I could never do that . And not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my world . MARY stands and walks over to a table . We see a witness stand and a table on the other side of it.We had two arguments to make in court . One was that Lillian Hellman was a public figure . If you 're a public figure , you 're expected to take more criticism than if you 're a housewife . She sits down at the table . LILLIAN enters and walks over to the other table . LILLIAN HELLMAN A public figure , according to my lawyer , is a person who assumes roles of special influence in the affairs of society . I do n't try to influence anyone but my friends  --  MARY MCCARTHY And the second argument was that you can not treat hyperbolic language as if it 's intended to be taken literally . But , of course , I did mean for it to be taken literally . LILLIAN HELLMAN Exactly . Which is why I sued you . p. 89 MARY MCCARTHY Here 's what I do n't understand  --  did n't you know she was going to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking about . MARY and LILLIAN sit down at the tables on either side of the witness stand . And now we hear a gavel pounding . ANNOUNCER The case of Lillian Hellman , plaintiff , against Mary McCarthy , defendant . MARY MCCARTHY I call Muriel Gardiner to the witness stand . ANNOUNCER Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God ? The spotlight hits MURIEL GARDINER in the witness stand . MURIEL GARDINER I do . MARY 'S LAWYER State your name , please . MURIEL GARDINER Muriel Morris Gardiner . Dr. Muriel Morris Gardiner  --  MARY 'S LAWYER You are a doctor of  --  MURIEL GARDINER I 'm a psychoanalyst . MARY 'S LAWYER Could you tell us a little about yourself ? MURIEL GARDINER I was born in Chicago in 1901 . I was the heiress to the Armour meatpacking fortune . I was graduated from Wellesley College and studied at Oxford . I then went to Vienna to study psychiatry at the Freud Institute . This was in 1934 . My first marriage had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria . p. 90 MARY 'S LAWYER Can you tell us what happened to you as war approached ? MURIEL GARDINER I was a socialist , and I became increasingly concerned as the Nazis came to power . And I was in a unique position  --  I had both American and British passports , and considerable wealth . So I joined the anti-fascist underground , and I was able to help a number of people escape from Austria . I fell in love with a man who was a leader of the resistance , and we were married and returned to America just before World War II . MARY MCCARTHY Have you ever met Lillian Hellman ? MURIEL GARDINER No . MARY 'S LAWYER When did you first hear of her ? MURIEL GARDINER Soon after I came back to America . She was a well-known playwright . And for a while we had the same lawyer . MARY 'S LAWYER In 1941 Lillian Hellman wrote a play called Watch on the Rhine . Did you see it ? MURIEL GARDINER No , I did n't . MARY 'S LAWYER Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austrian resistance leader and his American heiress wife ? MURIEL GARDINER Really ? I did n't know that . p. 91 MARY 'S LAWYER When did you hear about Lillian Hellman again ? MURIEL GARDINER It must have been about 1972 or 1973 . A friend called me on the telephone and said had I read a book by Lillian Hellman called Pentimento ? I said I had n't . And she said did I know Lillian Hellman ? I said we 'd never met . And the friend said , " You must read this book , Muriel . She has stolen your life . " It was all very dramatic . So I went out and bought a copy of the book , and I read the chapter in it that was the one she was apparently referring to  --  MARY 'S LAWYER The chapter called " Julia " ? MURIEL GARDINER Yes . MARY 'S LAWYER Could you tell us about that chapter , in your own words ? MURIEL GARDINER Well , it 's about a woman Lillian Hellman was friends with , a woman named Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GARDINER No , according to the book , Lillian Hellman changed her name . Julia was a rich young American woman who 'd gone to live in Austria to study with Freud  --  MARY MCCARTHY At the exact same time you did  --  MURIEL GARDINER Yes . She began working in the anti-fascist underground  --  p. 92 MARY MCCARTHY At the exact same time you did  --  MURIEL GARDINER Yes  --  MARY MCCARTHY And she , too , had a daughter  --  MURIEL GARDINER Yes , she did , a daughter named Lilly  --  MARY MCCARTHY After Lillian Hellman . Presumably the daughter 's name was not changed . MARY 'S LAWYER Please continue  --  MURIEL GARDINER At a certain point in the story , Julia asks Lillian Hellman to bring some money into Germany that 's to be used to smuggle people out of the country . Which she does . In a fur hat . And she meets Julia at a restaurant , and they have some caviar , and Lillian gets back on the train and goes on to Moscow , I believe . MARY 'S LAWYER According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GARDINER She was killed by the Nazis . MARY 'S LAWYER And what happened to Julia 's daughter , Lilly ? MURIEL GARDINER Killed by the Nazis . MARY 'S LAWYER After you read " Julia , " what did you do ? MURIEL GARDINER Well , first I thought , " Who knows ? Perhaps " So , on my next trip to Austria , I asked my friends if by any chance they knew of any other American woman involved in the anti-fascist underground . p. 93 MARY MCCARTHY And did they ? MURIEL GARDINER No . So , when I came home , I wrote Lillian Hellman a letter . MARY MCCARTHY And did it say , " You 've stolen my life " ? MURIEL GARDINER No , no , heavens no , not at all . And I did n't write her the letter right away . But it kept happening . People kept coming up to me and saying , " Have you read this story ? It 's your story . " " You must be Julia . " And so forth . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the many similarities between Julia 's life and my own and could n't help being curious because I had never met her Julia . It was very polite , I assure you . MARY 'S LAWYER Did you receive a reply to your letter ? MURIEL GARDINER No , I did n't . MARY 'S LAWYER Did you ever hear from Miss Hellman ? MURIEL GARDINER Yes . Several years later . She telephoned . Out of the blue . Well , not quite out of the blue . First her psychoanalyst called . MARY MCCARTHY Her psychoanalyst ? MURIEL GARDINER Yes . I did n't know he was her analyst . He was a doctor I knew slightly . He said he was calling on Lillian Hellman 's behalf to ask me to deny that I was Julia . By then my memoirs were about to be published , and there had been some publicity  --  p. 94 MARY MCCARTHY Some articles saying that you seemed to be the basis for Julia  --  MURIEL GARDINER Yes . MARY MCCARTHY And how did you respond to this doctor ? MURIEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I had never claimed to be Julia , so I could hardly claim not to be . A few days later the telephone rang again , and a voice said , " This is Lillian Hellman . " She said she wanted to meet me , perhaps we could have lunch . I said that I was sick in bed , which was true . She said that perhaps she would come to New Jersey to see me , and she said , " I would like to bring with me a very charming young man I am sure you would enjoy meeting . " Well , I assumed  --  perhaps incorrectly  --  that he was a lawyer , so I said that if she was bringing a friend , I might have a friend there , too . I 'm afraid it got a little silly . A few days later she called again . By then I had pneumonia , and I told her I would have to postpone the meeting . And she said , " I wanted to explain to you why I never answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MURIEL GARDINER I do n't know . You see , she had trouble hearing me , and I had trouble hearing her , so she said she 'd call me back and hung up . p. 95 MARY MCCARTHY When did she call you back ? MURIEL GARDINER I do n't think she ever called me back . MARY MCCARTHY I have just a few more questions , Dr. Gardiner . When you lived in Vienna , did you ever smuggle cash into the country for use in your activities ? MURIEL GARDINER It was n't necessary . In that period , it was very simple to do bank transfers . MARY MCCARTHY And what happened to your daughter ? MURIEL GARDINER She lives in Colorado . MARY MCCARTHY Thank you . To LILLIAN . Your witness . LILLIAN HELLMAN My witness ? She 's your witness . And you 're welcome to her . Look what you 've done  --  a courtroom scene , you had the audience on the edge of their seats . You could hear a pin drop . And then your witness takes the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't really hear her , " " I 'm afraid it got a little silly , " and how does it end ? It just dribbles away in a gigantic anticlimax . MARY MCCARTHY But what about what she said ? What about her story ? LILLIAN HELLMAN It 's an amazing story . It 's remarkably similar to mine , but I told mine so much better , do n't you think ? Someone had to tell her story . p. 96 MARY MCCARTHY Are you admitting you told her story ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Of course not . But what if I did ? Muriel Gardiner had thirty-some-odd years to tell her story . And did she ? No . She just sat out there in New Jersey letting a perfectly good story go to waste . And then my book came out , and she finally told her story . Thanks to me . She got a book contract , thanks to me . And she finally wrote her book , and guess what ? It 's boring . The woman ca n't tell her own story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own story  --  or to be famous , or celebrated , or lionized . She is , forgive me , a good person . LILLIAN HELLMAN But she 's not a writer . To MURIEL GARDINER . You are not a writer . Sorry . MURIEL GARDINER I suppose that 's true . I 'm not a writer . Stands . I 'm a psychoanalyst . And our time is up for today . But may I say something to you both . To MARY . Look at you , Mary . Someone once told you a lie , a terrible lie , so you made a religion out of the truth . And it turned out to be your blind spot , because you never understood how subjective and elusive and abstract truth is  --  you simply thought that if you could prove someone was telling a lie , you 'd won . To LILLIAN . You , on the other hand , witnessed a traumatic version of the primal scene , and then you were persuaded to lie about it . So you spent your life telling lies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It all seems quite hopeless . If only there were a door to slam . Good-bye . She walks offstage . The two women watch her go . A beat . p. 97 LILLIAN HELLMAN Is she gone ? MARY MCCARTHY I think so . LILLIAN HELLMAN A perfect example of the limits of Freudian analysis . MARY MCCARTHY I could n't agree more . LILLIAN HELLMAN Of course , there was no trial . MARY MCCARTHY None at all . LILLIAN HELLMAN I died before there could be one . MARY MCCARTHY And that was the end of that . The case never went to court . But by the time you died , Muriel Gardiner 's book had been published , and everyone knew you 'd made the whole thing up . And not just anything . You stopped Hitler . You , Lillian Hellman , stopped Hitler and saved the Jews with your little fur hat . LILLIAN HELLMAN But you did n't win . MARY MCCARTHY I destroyed you . LILLIAN HELLMAN And yet the only reason you 're here is because of me . MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ? What if that light on your face  --  She points to the spotlight.  --  is shining only because you 're up here with me ? Who are you , anyway ? You 're what's-her-name who made the mistake of picking Lillian Hellman for an enemy . You 're that writer I sued because you were so mean  --  p. 98 MARY MCCARTHY That 's not why you sued me . You sued me for the fun of it  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN I do like a good time  --  MARY MCCARTHY You sued me to bankrupt me  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN How could I have known you 'd saved so little money ? MARY MCCARTHY You sued me to give yourself something to live for  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN All of the above . I was old and sick and blind and looking for a reason to go on getting out of bed every day , and you were as good a reason as any . I sued you so you would be awake at three in the morning , like me . I sued you so that when you looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would blame me for it . I sued you so that when you went to the doctor with the next awful thing wrong with you , you would see me smiling through the X rays . I sued you to shorten your life . Did I shorten your life ? MARY MCCARTHY Yes . You did . LILLIAN HELLMAN Good . I 'm glad . MARY MCCARTHY And I 'm glad I outlived you . Although I did n't want you to die . I was very disappointed there was no trial . I wanted you to lose in court . LILLIAN HELLMAN You said that at the time , and even your friends were horrified . p. 99 MARY MCCARTHY There 's no satisfaction in having an enemy die . LILLIAN HELLMAN I brought out the worst in you . MARY MCCARTHY I was your undoing  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN You were nothing more than an irritation  --  MARY MCCARTHY I was your nemesis  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN You rarely crossed my mind  --  MARY MCCARTHY You wanted to be me  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN You wanted what was mine  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a third act  --  MARY MCCARTHY I ruined your third act  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN I was your third act  --  MARY MCCARTHY Liar ! LILLIAN HELLMAN Bitch ! They look at each other , hatred burning . They grab each other . And then they kiss . MARY MCCARTHY I hate you . LILLIAN HELLMAN I wish you were dead . p. 100 MARY MCCARTHY I am . LILLIAN HELLMAN Even so . A beat . MARY MCCARTHY I 'm leaving . LILLIAN HELLMAN So am I. MARY MCCARTHY I do n't have to take this . LILLIAN HELLMAN Enough is enough . MARY MCCARTHY Where do you think you 're going ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Anywhere but here . MARY MCCARTHY Anywhere ? But here we are . LILLIAN HELLMAN You and I. There 's nowhere to go.Stuck  --  MARY MCCARTHY Together  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Forever . MARY MCCARTHY What did we do to deserve each other ? LILLIAN HELLMAN Everything , apparently . A long beat . MARY MCCARTHY Where did Goethe write " Choose your enemies well " ? LILLIAN HELLMAN He did n't . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 101 MARY MCCARTHY You never did say who Julia was . All you ever said was  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN Miss Hellman will reveal who Julia was at the right time . MARY MCCARTHY Well , tell us now . We 're here . We 're listening . When LILLIAN does n't answer . She was you . She was the person you might have been if you had n't been the person you were . LILLIAN HELLMAN Who would you have been ? If they had n't lied to you . For instance . MARY MCCARTHY Hard to know . A better novelist , perhaps . Re : Julia . She was just a story . LILLIAN HELLMAN I 'm just a story . So are you . The question is , who gets to tell it ? A beat.Was there ever a moment we could have been friends ? MARY MCCARTHY Hard to imagine.And what happened to the U-boats ? LILLIAN HELLMAN To the U-boats ? What do you think happened ? MARY MCCARTHY They collided . LILLIAN HELLMAN Absolutely . They collided . MARY MCCARTHY And one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCCARTHY Both of them were destroyed . LILLIAN HELLMAN Possibly . MARY MCCARTHY Both of them were damaged  --  LILLIAN HELLMAN And both of them survived . LILLIAN AND MARY Together . Possibly . MARY MCCARTHY But which one was it ? In real life ? And do n't tell me there 's no such thing . Do n't tell me there 's no such thing as the truth . I do n't believe that . LILLIAN HELLMAN I know you do n't . MARY MCCARTHY I believe in the truth . LILLIAN HELLMAN I believe in the story . The lights go down onstage , and LILLIAN and MARY stand there . Behind them , on the scrim , we see two lists . On Lillian 's side : " Works by Lillian Hellman , " and a list of her twelve plays and four memoirs . On Mary 's side : " Works by Mary McCarthy , " and a list of her twenty-six books .
