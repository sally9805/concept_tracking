If you think we 're going to get a democracy up and running in Iraq by midsummer , maybe you should know that it takes two hours to teach Iowans how to vote in their own caucus . And these are Iowans who have been to caucuses before . <P> Admittedly , the Iowa caucus is the most painstaking , complicated form of democracy to exist outside a campus women 's collective . Instead of walking into a voting booth , pulling the top lever for President and randomly yanking the rest of them like you 're supposed to , the caucus is a three-hour Monday-night political dorkfest reserved for the kinds of people who get psyched about jury duty . In 2000 , only 61,000 Iowans showed up to vote , and it 's not as if there 's a lot to do in Iowa in January . <P> To explain how it all works , Iowa Secretary of State Chet Culver is going around the state holding practice caucuses . At his workshop last Tuesday at the library in Clive , a suburb seven miles west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several of them young enough to be my parents . Most of these folks already knew how caucuses work and just wanted a refresher course . Clive needs to get itself a bowling alley . <P> As Culver , 37 , a former history teacher , began with an hour-long PowerPoint presentation on the history of the caucus going back to 1846 , a sign-language interpreter flashed signs  --  even though not a single person in the room was deaf . It hit me about 15 minutes into the speech that the sign-language guy must have realized no one there was deaf , but by that time it was too embarrassing to just stop . So he kept going , his bravery a further testimony to the lengths Iowans go through just to get David Broder to visit . <P> For the second hour , Culver had the audience stage a fake caucus . It turns out the Republican caucus is really simple . They pass around ballots , count them and go home to watch Everybody Loves Raymond while the Democrats are still reading their rules . I predict the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caucus begins at 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 19 , the first thing everyone in both parties will do is vote on a committee chair . Then caucusgoers will debate and vote on issues they 'd like to see on the party 's platform at the convention . Finally , the people at the Democratic caucus make speeches for all the Democratic candidates , including Undecided . Undecided , by the way , has taken the Democratic Iowa caucus several times , as in 1972 and 1976 . If Confused were a candidate , it would win even more often . <P> After the speeches , everyone then votes by walking to the section of the room designated for his or her candidate . Any group with less than 15% of the attendees is considered nonviable and has to disband . Then the realignment period begins , in which everyone walks around and tries to persuade the disbanded people , and anyone else , to join them . The classic way to do that is to bribe them by making them delegates to the convention . That 's like a trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have at least 15% , a formula Culver describes as " needing a Ph.D . in math to understand " is used to determine how many delegates each candidate gets . The percentage of delegates each candidate gets is the number reported in the media . Then the media , for reasons that are unclear , pretend that has something to do with whom the country wants to be President .
