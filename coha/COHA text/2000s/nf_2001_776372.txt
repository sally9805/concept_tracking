Why God Made Adam Last // God wuz through makin ' de Ian ' an ' de sea an ' de birds an ' de animals an ' de fishes an ' de trees befo ' He made man . He wuz intendin ' tuh make ' im all along , but He put it off tuh de last cause if He had uh made Adam fust an ' let him see Him makin ' all dese other things , when Eve wuz made Adam would of stood round braggin ' tuh her . He would of said : " Eve , do you see dat ole stripe-ed tagger ( tiger ) over dere ? Ah made . See dat ole narrow geraffe ( giraffe ) over dere ? Ah made ' im too . See dat big ole tree over dere ? Ah made dat jus ' so you could set under it . " God knowed all dat , so He jus ' waited till everything wuz finished before he made man , cause He knows man will lie and brag on hisself tuh uh woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made  --  he ai n't meant tuh know .  --  James Presley. // When God first put folks on earth there was n't no difference between men and women . They was all alike . They did de same work and everything . De man got tired uh fussin ' bout who gointer do this and who gointer do that . So he went up tuh God and ast him tuh give him power over de woman so dat he could rule her and stop all dat arguin ' . He ast Him tuh give him a lil mo ' strength and he 'd do de heavy work and let de woman jus ' take orders from him whut to do . He tole Him he would n't mind doing de heavy work if he could jus ' boss de job . So de Lawd done all he ast Him and he went on back home  --  and right off he started tuh bossin ' de woman uh-round . So de woman did n't lak dat a-tall . So she went up tuh God and ast Him how come He give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So He tole her , " You never ast Me for none . I thought you was satisfied . " She says , " Well , I ai n't , wid de man bossin ' me round lak he took tuh doin ' since you give him all de power . I wants half uh his power . Take it away and give it tuh me . " De Lawd shook His head . He tole her , " I never takes nothin ' back after I done give it out . It 's too bad since you do n't like it , but you shoulda come up wid him , then I woulda ' vided it half and half . " De woman was so mad she left dere spittin ' lak a cat . She went straight tuh de devil . He tole her : " I 'll tell you whut to do . You go right back up tuh God and ast Him tuh give you dat bunch uh keys hangin ' by de mantle shelf , den bring ' em here tuh me and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kin have mo ' power than man . " So she did and God give ' em tuh her thout uh word and she took ' em back tuh de devil . They was three keys on dat ring . So de devil tole her whut they was . One was de key to de bedroom and one was de key to de cradle and de other was de kitchen key . He tole her not tuh go home and start no fuss , jus ' take de keys and lock up everything an ' wait till de man come in  --  and she could have her way . So she did . De man tried tuh ack stubborn at first . But he could n't git no peace in de bed and nothin ' tuh eat , an ' he could n't make no generations tuh follow him unless he use his power tuh suit de woman . It was n't doin ' him no good tuh have de power cause she would n't let ' im use it lak he wanted tuh . So he tried tuh dicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de power if she would let him keep de keys half de time . De devil popped right up and tole her naw , jus ' keep whut she got and let him keep whut he got . So de man went back up tuh God , but He tole him Jus ' lak he done de woman . So he ast God jus ' tuh give him part de key tuh de cradle so 's he could know and be sure who was de father of chillun , but God shook His head and tole him : " You have tuh ast de woman and take her word . She got de keys and I never take back whut I give out . " So de man come on back and done lak de woman tole him for de sake of peace in de bed . And thass how come women got de power over mens today .  --  Old Man Drummond. // God done pretty good when He made man , but He could have made us a lot more convenient . For instance : we only got eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in de back , too , so nuthin ' ca n't slip upon us . Nuther thing : it would be handy , too , ef we had one right on de end uv our dog finger ( first finger ) . Den we could jest point dat eye any which way . Nuther thing : our mouths oughter be on top uv our heads ' stead uh right in front . Then , when I 'm late tuh work I kin just throw my breakfast in my hat , an ' put my hat on my head , an ' eat my breakfast as I go on tuh work . Now , ai n't dat reasonable , Miss ? Besides , mouths ai n't so pretty nohow.  --  George Brown . // One day Christ wuz going along wid His disciples an ' He tole ' em all tuh pick up uh rock an ' bring it along .
