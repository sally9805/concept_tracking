Plump , freshly picked berries warmed by the summer sun melt in your mouth , tickle your taste buds , and temporarily turn your tongue purple . Photograph left : ' Kiowa ' blackberries produce jumbo fruit that can grow to 1 1/2 inches long . The plants will yield juicy , ebony-colored fruit for around six weeks . // Wien I was a child , my grandmother would dust me with sulfur powder before I went out berry picking . The yellow powder helped to ward off the chiggers that could make me itch and be miserable for days . So each summer I was brave and fearlessly waded into enemy territory with only a small bucket in hand . Photograph below , left : The ' Kiowa ' blackberries on the left grow much larger than wild berries and are just as flavorful. // Battling the chest-high briar thickets always left my arms and legs scratched . The mission was complete only after I had harvested enough blackberries for a cobbler or two . All my pain and suffering was rewarded , though , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A large scoop of vanilla ice cream placed on top of a bowl full of hot cobbler would melt and meld with the berry filling for an unforgettable flavor . I still look forward to that summery dessert , but I 've learned that blackberry picking does n't have to be painful . Some of today 's selections can grow as big as the end of your thumb . Train these superior berries on a trellis , and you can pick the large fruit with ease . There are even thornless selections such as ' Arapaho ' and ' Navaho ' that have smooth stems and still produce large , juicy clusters of fruit . Easy Picking Last summer I visited Jason Powell in Jemison , Alabama , and picked kingsize berries at his Petals From the Past Nursery . Along with selling plants , Jason and his wife , Shelley , have a small you-pick operation . Customers can visit the nursery and gather blackberries , blueberries , apples , figs , muscadines , or persimmons , depending on the season . But Jason says everyone flocks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red and green fruit begins to swell and glisten purplish black . By mid-June , the berries are peaking . The plants produce ripe fruit for about six weeks , and each one yields 8 to 10 pounds of juicy berries . The Biggest Berries Jason planted several rows of ' Kiowa ' blackberries four years ago and has trained them to grow on a trellis . The upright plants do have thorny canes , but they produce enormous fruit . In fact , they have the largest of any blackberry . They can grow 8 to 10 times bigger than wild berries . ( See photo at left . ) Training on a Trellis Jason sets plants out 5 feet apart in a sunny location . A post-and-wire trellis supports the vigorous growers . ( See illustration on page 77 . ) Two wires run horizontally between the posts . The first wire is 24 inches off the ground , and the second is 48 inches high . Once the plants begin to grow , Jason selects the two strongest canes to train and cuts the rest to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw hat . above : Blackberries can be grown on a trellis for easy picking . // Throughout the summer , he prunes out any new canes that appear so they do n't take energy away from berry production . He allows the first cane to grow 2 or 3 inches above the 24-inch-high wire , and then cuts it off an inch below the wire . Two side shoots will branch out below where the stem was cut . These are then trained to run along the wire . The second cane is allowed to grow a couple of inches above the 48-inch wire ; then it 's cut an inch below that wire . The two side shoots that appear are trained to grow horizontally on the upper wire . As the side shoots lengthen , they are wrapped around the wires and loosely held there using plastic ties or twine . While training the thorny selections , you will definitely need a pair of leather gloves . ' Arapaho ' and ' Navaho ' are two outstanding thornless selections that can be trained this way and are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow on an existing fence or even espalier them against a wall . A family of four will need to grow only five or six plants to have plenty of fresh produce . Around Fourth of July , after the plants stop producing , Jason cuts all the blackberry canes back to the ground and starts the training process over again . The vines grow back rapidly , and by late August or early September , they will completely cover the trellis .

Many new , improved selections are available at nurseries and garden centers , but if you ca n't find them , they can be mail-ordered . Jason says the plants are really tough . Once established , they need little water and have few problems with pests or diseases . Ripe berries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw netting over the plants when berries are present . Jason fertilizes in spring with an all-purpose , slow-release product such as 12-6-6 at a rate of 8 tablespoons per plant . After the Fourth of July cut-back , he lightly fertilizes plants with calcium nitrate to force new growth . Find a sunny spot in your garden , and plant a few of the new , improved selections . Grow them on a fence , wall , or trellis , and you wo n't have to wade through thorny thickets in search of summer 's favorite berry . Photograph Blackberry Trellis A ) Select the two largest canes , and cut the rest to the ground . Allow one cane to grow a few inches above the 24-inch wire and the other to grow a tew inches above the 48-inch wire . Then cut each cane 1 inch below the wires . B ) Side shoots will sprout at the cutoff point and should be trained to the horizontal wires . // <p>                  @ @ @
