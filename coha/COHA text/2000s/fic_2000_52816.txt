It was his father 's wedding day . Roland had flown into London the night before and slept at the hotel off Russell Square where he 'd stayed during the last days of his mother 's illness . The ceremony , at the parish church near his father 's new house in Suffolk , was set for noon ; reception at the house to follow . Roland woke late and found to his surprise that he had had an erotic dream . He tried to remember it , but the attempt itself scattered the last traces still lingering in his head . <p> He cleaned off its physical residue in the shower , then dressed carefully in front of the mirror : his father had always been a stickler for tradition , and the words formal attire had been printed on the invitation . <p> The rented outfit , which came complete with gray top hat , silk tie , starched shirt , and even a red carnation , fitted him well , and in spite of the absurd tails hanging halfway down his legs , Roland was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He set off across London in a green Citroen  --  also rented  --  and was soon on the motorway . It was a bright day ; cool , with a few hooked scratch marks of cloud crisscrossing the blue . Cirrus Uncinus , he said to himself . His father , a naturalist , had made him learn the names of clouds when he was a boy , and he still remembered them . <p> The old man was in his seventies now . His bride , Rosemary , was n't much over thirty . In another man Roland might have been surprised at the gulf , but not in his father . Wiry and agile , with thick silver hair swept back from his forehead , sharp eyes still fiercely scrutinizing the world from his buzzard-like face , he had conceded little more than a kind of flinty hardening to the passage of time . <p> Roland had been introduced to Rosemary at a drinks party on his last visit . She was a biologist , and had met his father on a scientific expedition to Tierra del Fuego . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Roland think of a particular kind of craftsman 's tool-a planishing hammer , was it ? - in its smoothly molded planes and concavities ; its look of having been evolved to perform some highly specific , complex function . <p> She had come towards him with an expression that had in it both shyness and something propitiatory . She seemed to want to convey to him her innocence of anything that might smack of an intent to interfere in his relations with his father , to assure him of her friendliness , and even in some way to ask his forgiveness for anything in the situation that he might find uncomfortable . They had n't talked for long , but he had left feeling well-disposed towards her . <p> He had seen her one more time on that visit . She 'd come to London for the day , and had rung him at his hotel to invite him for lunch . They ate at a Greek restaurant and afterwards spent an hour wandering through the quiet streets around Hanover Square . Again the sensitivity , the propitiatory manner that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt relaxed , and in response to her tactful but evidently sincere curiosity , talked to her quite volubly about his life  --  the well-paid banking job in Brussels that his father disapproved of ( he disapproved of any profession that was n't explicitly dedicated to the betterment of the human race ) , his unraveling marriage , his childhood . <p> His mother 's unhappy existence had ended in a hospital not far from where they were walking , and as they approached the shabbier streets that had become so familiar to him from his daily visits , he began to feel all the harsh emotions of that period resurrect themselves inside him . Whether by chance or by some peculiar power of intuition , it was just then that Rosemary began to question him about his mother . Caught off his guard , which had been firmly up since her death , Roland had found himself delivering a long , fervent speech full of all the sorrow and exasperation that had lain pent up inside him for the past three years . Without criticizing his father , he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret symbiosis between his father 's vigor and his mother 's steady decline . However much the old man harangued her for not pursuing a career , for not seeing a psychiatrist when she became depressed , for drinking too much , for smoking after she was diagnosed with cancer , there was some part of him ( and for this Roland admitted he had no evidence beyond his own highly subjective instincts ) that required absolutely that she remain on the downward slide , just as a healthy plant requires the steady disintegration of the organisms in the soil around it in order to thrive . And by whatever convoluted action of the psyche , his irreproachable concern for her welfare had precisely the opposite effect of what was apparently intended . It kept her in thrall to her own failure . <p> Within about twenty minutes of leaving the motorway , Roland realized that he was lost . His father 's map , which plunged from A to Z without regard for any of the opportunities for deviation that country roads offer in between , no longer corresponded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to recognize a name on a signpost : without luck . Passing some houses , he considered stopping and asking for directions , but he felt awkward at the idea of going up a stranger 's garden path in his wedding regalia , and before he could make up his mind to do it , the houses were behind him . <p> He realized that unless he found himself soon he would be late for the wedding , which would not go down well with the old man . By now , though , he was deep in the country . Fields of ripe barley lay on either side of him . There were a few barns here and there , but no houses . Small , unmarked roads appeared , each one necessitating a brief debate as to whether or not to explore it , so adding further to his consternation . Finally he came to the entrance of a driveway with the name of a farm on a sign . <p> The driveway twisted sharply down through a wood , then came out into a bare brown field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offal-like smell of pigs blew in through the car window , though another quarter of a mile passed before he came to the gate of the farm itself . He parked to the side of the gate . The elegant Gallic contours of the Citroen looked almost as out of place here as he himself did in his tails and red carnation . Through the gate was a rundown courtyard of pigsties with a hundred or more pigs  --  gray and hairy with pink patches-rooting and snuffling inside them . As Roland walked past , they crowded forward to the iron bars , making loud , harsh squeals and grunts . Their sties were several inches deep in slop . Huge mounds of refuse were piled in the corners . <p> Not just the pigs themselves , but everything in the courtyard was covered in mud : buckets , bits of machinery , a small caravan occupied by chickens , even the chickens themselves . There was a forlorn oak tree with mud-covered leaves , and a wheelbarrow so caked with mud it looked as though it had been made out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the entrance of the farmhouse , and knocked . A woman wearing a short-sleeved dress and house slippers came to the door . She looked him up and down . He explained that he was on his way to a wedding and had got lost . <p> " Oh dear . I better get you a map . Come in . " <p> She brought him into the kitchen , where she found a map and spread it on the table . She was about forty ; large , with plump , pale arms . Her body in its thin cotton covering gave off a powdery odor  --  part perfume , part cigarette ash . Her eyes had a becalmed expression , almost dazed , but every now and then settling on Roland with a soft attentiveness . <p> " Who is it getting married , then ? " <p> " My father . " <p> " Ah . That 's nice . " <p> They found a route on the map . Thanking her for her help , Roland turned to leave . As he did , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white rabbit by the ears . Both the man and the rabbit were staring at him with expressions of amazement . <p> " He 's lost his way , " the woman explained . " He 's going to his father 's wedding . " <p> The man said nothing . Roland edged out of the door past him , giving him a nod , which the man ignored . As Roland left he heard a crunch and thud , and a moment later a white rabbit head , still wearing its look of amazement , sailed past him into one of the pigsties . The pigs converged on it in a cacophony of squeals . Roland noticed that a drop of blood from the severed head had splashed onto his polished black shoe . He turned back to the house , perturbed by the farmer 's aggressiveness , but the man had gone inside . <p> The gate out to the drive where the Citroen was parked was now blocked by a gigantic red tractor . Roland stopped , jarred by the sight into what seemed to be a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tractor before ? He had the sense of having recently seen a tractor exactly like this one , though since this was the first time he had been outside a city in years , it was hard to imagine where it might have been . Even so , there was something familiar about it . <p> As he moved on towards it , he realized he would n't be able to squeeze past it without dirtying his suit . He looked for another way out . On either side of him was thick , wet-looking black mud . A little way forward on his left , however , some planks had been laid down in a line leading to a gap in a brick wall . He stepped onto the planks , and walked gingerly along to investigate . <p> As he did , he thought again of the farmer 's behavior . It occurred to him that the man might have been a jealous husband wondering whether he had surprised his wife in the middle of a clandestine meeting with her lover . Dressed as he was , he perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image that a jealous temperament might have found irresistibly suspicious . Then , too , Roland surmised as he picked his way along the planks , perhaps he did have the face of an adulterer . A man 's more significant deeds might perhaps have a way of imprinting themselves on his anatomy , if in a manner visible only to the unconscious eye of other people . Had his marital infidelities left their signature on his flesh ? Had the farmer dimly perceived it ? Was he at some level even correct in his appraisal of the situation ; that Roland did have designs on his wife ? In a detached , clinical manner , Roland brought the woman back into his mind , imagined being in bed with her , was reassuringly unaroused , smiled to himself at the absurdity of it all , then suddenly remembered where he had seen the tractor before . It was what he had opened his eyes to on the nursery floor where he and the children 's Dutch nanny had first had sex . Unlike the one here at the farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant it had seemed vast and strangely menacing , perhaps because his three-year-old son was riding it . <p> By this point Roland had come to the gap in the wall at the end of the planks and seen that the wall itself enclosed a pool full of viscous greenish liquid that smelled like the contents of an open septic tank . There was no means of getting to the grass beyond it , and he turned to walk back . It was at this moment that the memory of the tractor had suddenly come to him , bringing with it a great wave of anxiety that seemed to contain in it the whole calamity of his marriage  --  the apparently inconsolable hurt he had inflicted on his wife , the silentness that had fallen on their young child , the bitter dismantling of the home  --  all of it surging through him with a force that for a moment overwhelmed him . He missed his footing on the plank . Groping at air to regain his balance , he fell backwards into the stinking pool . <p> A moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was aware of extending it for as long as he could . Although the day was cool , the liquid was warm , and in this state of surrender , what he felt seeping through his jacket and trousers was n't wholly unpleasant . He looked at the old farm buildings around him , the crops beyond , the sky overhead : for a while he felt almost blissful . It was only as he hoisted himself out of the pool , rising from it like a swamp animal dripping slime , that he began to feel the true foulness of his condition . There was no pain , not even any great physical discomfort . But the sensation of a vile uncleanness both soaking into him and emanating out from him was inexpressibly horrible . He trudged back through the mud ( what need now for the planked walkway ? ) towards the gate blocked by the squatting tractor . There before him , he saw what he had managed to conceal from himself before : just to the side of the main gate was another little one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attire . <p> Tearing up clumps of dock ( Rumex Crispus ) , he did what he could to wipe himself clean . He lined the seat of the Citroen with a protective layer of stalks and leaves before sitting down on it . In this manner , reeking , oozing greenish muck , he resumed his journey . <p> He was more than an hour late by the time he reached his father 's village . Coming to the church , he saw that the wedding service was already over , and he drove on to the house . <p> This was a large building of brick and cobblestones . A rounded glass conservatory , filled no doubt with his father 's specimens , protruded gracefully from the ample front . A brass band was playing in a marquee with fluttering pennants at the back of the wide lawn , where a couple of hundred guests were being served champagne . Under the shaggy arms of a cedar , long trestle tables had been set up , garlanded with flowers . <p> Large family gatherings had always unnerved Roland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the more troubling aspects of his mother 's personality : the outrageous remarks  --  cruel , snobbish , or simply bizarre  --  that any group above a certain critical mass seemed guaranteed to elicit from her ; and then later the drunken outbursts of weeping , cursing , even violence , that his father 's response of dignified silence served only to fan to ever more destructive heights . <p> He thought of the strange way his mother 's image had been transfigured in his own consciousness . Alive , she had been a perpetual source of pain and humiliation  --  hatred even . Dying , she had aroused a kind of morbid solicitousness in him , strong enough that he had taken two months off from his job to look after her as she moved from her flat to the hospital and then to the crematorium . Dead , she had undergone a final change in his imagination , turning into something frail , blossomlike , but enduring , for which he bore unexpected tenderness and love . He heard her voice , sad and low , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , she would say after each new attempt to make something of her life had been abandoned . The volunteer work , the college administration job , the gift shop ... It just is n't me ... A familiar dim helplessness washed through him . At moments he could glimpse something almost intentional behind his own calamities ; an obscure , insidious solidarity ... Abruptly , the dream he had woken from that morning in his hotel came back to him : the woman in it had been his mother . A sharp pang of dismay went through him . A wet dream about my own mother , he thought , almost wearily . What next ? <p> Clammy , still smelling badly , with bits of straw and torn leaves sticking to the slime on his suit , he made his way towards the guests . Before he reached them , he caught sight of his father : as ever a little shorter than he remembered him , but his silver hair gleaming with that curious vitality that had the effect of making you briefly question whether you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver was n't after all the color of youth , while brown , black , and blond were the colors hair turned in old age . Beside him stood Rosemary , slim and erect in her white outfit , her veil pinned back , flowers and seed-pearls gleaming in the silk and lace of her dress . <p> Moving towards the crowd of guests , Roland had the impression of entering the locus of a single , vast , living organism . The old man had always had a gift for ceremony , display ; for all those occasions requiring a particular complex of forces to be summoned into harmonious form . University chancellors regularly consulted him on their processionals and jubilees , as did the organizers of village fetes . What radiant entity had he brought forth here ? As Roland approached , its epidermis seemed to shrink from him , as though fine hairs or antennae had detected something inimical to its own rustling brilliance . <p> His father saw him . <p> " Ah . There you are , " he said , not unkindly . His manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Roland 's imagination . But when he saw the state Roland was in , he stiffened . <p> " What in heaven 's name  --  " <p> " I 'm sorry  --  " <p> As Roland moved towards him , he stepped back , drawing Rosemary with him . She pulled her arm free , however , and looked at Roland with the same warmth in her eyes as he had seen when he first met her . For a moment it seemed she had n't noticed his condition , but when he heard his father say , " Rosemary , be careful , he 's filthy , " and saw her continue on towards him , it occurred to him that she did n't care . Over his own swamp-smell he caught the fragrance of lilies-of-the-valley . She put her long , silkfurled arms about him and drew him close , her white dress surely staining in great oval blotches from his oozing suit . In her embrace he thought again of his dream ; his mother 's incontinent body whole , supple in his hands ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And yet as he stood there he felt as if he were on the point of being cleansed of the confusions , the glutinous horrors of his day , and instead of letting Rosemary go , he drew her tighter to him , burying his head in her sweetsmelling shoulder , while dimly beyond her he could hear his father tutting and fussing . And a strange elation rose through him , as though the great miasma that had hung upon his life so long it had come to seem a part of his own nature , might after all be about to lift . <p> <p> By James Lasdun <p>
