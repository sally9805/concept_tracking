Chapter One : Bugs The fascinating thing about bugs  --  all living creatures , really  --  is that they are designed to save themselves . Nothing is extraneous , nothing decorative ; every feature is part of an intricate mechanism of survival . Some disguise themselves as thorns or sand , others as dead leaves or tropical flowers . The damselfly poses as a blade of grass ; the golden wheel spider rolls into a ball and tumbles away . The walking stick can assume different forms . Sometimes it looks like a twig : thin , mottled brown , a cinnamon stick with feet . Other times it 's gold or green , splayed open like a ragged leaf . When the bug is sitting on a tree branch , it 's impossible to know it 's there . As Claire looks at her hand resting on the kitchen counter , a walking stick appears in her mind 's eye . Her pale skin is the same shade as her Formica . The freckles sprinkled across the back of her hand merge with a smattering of dots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly , then lowers it . She has become indistinguishable from her kitchen . She crosses the kitchen and pushes open the back door . It 's been raining all morning , a steady rain , the temperature hovering just above freezing . She steps into the backyard  --  half-mown , half-ragged  --  and shuffles across the long side , wet fronds darkening her slippers like paintbrush tips . She is wearing her bug slippers , a giftshe received from Bob shortly after they moved to New Hampshire . They are difficult to walk in , like shuffling inside two couch pillows . A year ago , the beetles ' heads were bright yellow ; now they are faded , their antennae limp , chins angled toward the ground in defeat . She grips the handle of Bob 's garage-turned-office and heaves the door open to the screech of rusty metal . Bob looks surprised to see her there ; rarely does she interrupt his work . Claire is equally surprised by this vision of her husband . Whenever she pictures Bob in his office , it 's with head bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , slack-jawed , eyes trained not on a slide or book or specimen but gazing into the dull vortex of his office , a nest of computer wires clustered at his feet . " Claire ? " Bob says , sitting up straight . " What 's  --  " " Nothing 's wrong , " Claire says . She pauses a beat . " I need to go . " " Okay , " he says . " No . I mean , I need to  --  leave . " Bob 's lips , at rest , are always slightly parted . Claire drops her eyes from his face . She focuses on the long , low cabinet behind him : a card catalog of insects , a hundred tiny coffins , glass-flattened , toe-tagged , angel-winged . The wall above it is covered with important papers in brown frames  --  diplomas , citations , their wedding photo , a merit certificate from YES , the Young Entomologists ' Society . " Maybe just for a while , " Claire says . " I just have to . I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses and is rubbing them with a satiny red square , plucked from his pocket like a magician 's scarf . It 's one of his signature habits , reverted to in moments of disorientation : as if by cleaning the lenses the problem on the other side will become clear . " But , " he says , pushing his glasses back on . " But , ah , where would you go ? " Bob is a rational man ; it is a large part of why Claire married him . He is steady with his emotions , realistic in his expectations , quick to unclog a sink . He is the kind of man who would never do a crossword puzzle in anything but pencil , who will always cut bagels in half before he freezes them . But when it comes to life 's more complicated moments , situations that demand emotion  --  in which another husband might ask why or how or what had he done or , my God , what could he do to change her mind  --  Bob 's first priority , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chest . She feels disengaged from herself , her mind from her mouth , hearing her own words as if spoken by someone else . She must hold herself in place carefully  --  too much talk , too much motion , and she might splinter apart . Then Bob stands up and takes a step toward her . " I 'm sorry , " Claire says . Her voice is trembling . She unclasps her arms , slides her wedding ring off , and drops it in an empty kill jar on the end of Bob 's desk .
