HALFWAY HOME FROM CAMP , Ben 's father stops the car in front of a slate blue ranch house . A yard sale . A woman squints at them from behind a card table . It 's dishes , a bicycle , ugly paintings , winter coats with orange linings and furry hoods , a beanbag chair , a turntable and some records . <p> Ben 's father surveys it all , hands in pockets . There 's nothing for Ben 's mother . Ben can tell he 's sorry they stopped . It 's awkward on this woman 's lawn . His father wants to buy something so they can leave . Or he 'll thank the woman and walk back to the car shamefaced . <p> A red box catches Ben 's eye . " Electronics Lab , " it reads . " Everything you need to build a timer buzzer , logic tester , first aid siren , voltage detector , conductivity tester , sound level meter , and much more . Safe , educational , and fun . Learn basic principles of electricity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is marked $6 . Ben holds it and waits for his father to notice . He does n't have to ask . <p> His father turns to the woman and opens up his yard sale talent : " Does it come with instructions ? " Not " What 'll you take for this ? " He starts by tearing it down . First ascertain value , he once explained to Ben , then haggle . <p> " All the pieces are there , " the woman says , " with the instructions . " <p> Ben is n't sure how long he can hold the kit . Yard sales are personal , not like stores where you can carry things around for an hour and then put them back if you change your mind . <p> The woman watches him set the box back on the table . " My son died , " she says . " This was his . " <p> " Drugs ? " Ben 's father asks . <p> " Leukemia , " she says . <p> " My sister died , " Ben says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Would you take five for it ? " <p> " Fine , " she says . " Take it . " <p> In the car Ben puts the kit on his lap and studies the top of the box . <p> " Son of a bitch , " his father says . <p> Ben wo n't open the kit now . If he does , his father will warn him about losing a piece . Instead , he plans his inventions . A timer buzzer would help him manage his homework . His mother might use it to time a cake in the oven . A voltage detector could save someone 's life . <p> " Read the instructions first , " his father says . " Do n't blow the circuits . " <p> Which is funny-the kit does n't connect to the outlets in the house , it uses batteries . <p> " You can sleep if you want , and I 'll wake you when we 're in Manassas . " <p> It 's not a long ride from Goshen , Ben thinks , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're home ; he 's not sure when he fell asleep . His bedroom is just as he left it : plastic army men lie scattered on the carpet . His favorite soldier has a gas tank on his back , a flamethrower in his arms . He 's torching something or someone , finishing up a battle or starting one . Flamethrower had no one to burn except his own men until Ben received a bag of Belgians from his aunt . They wore tall fur hats and skirts . Flamethrower torched them , over and over . The Belgians , whom he sometimes called Hessians , scurried for cover , hid behind chair legs . A few surrendered . Sometimes Flamethrower accepted their surrender ; other times he burned them , recognizing the white flag as deception . <p> Sunday they 're supposed to go to church , but his parents do n't get up . They 're sleeping late but Ben ca n't . He 's wet the bed , just like every night at camp . He does n't know why he 's started again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took frigid showers before the grabass and towel fights commenced . The smell was so bad he threw his sleeping bag into the woods and spent his last night in his poncho . <p> Ben cleans up in the bathroom , smoothes talcum powder over his raw skin , pink like a baby 's . He dresses and checks on his bean plants in the backyard . They 're dead , killed by the August sun . His parents were supposed to give fertilizer to one plant and just water to the other . Ben was going to measure their height and note characteristics of their leaves , stalks , and hue . It was for the science fairhe 'd modified the experiment from a library book . He 'll begin again . <p> Or will he ? The kit has everything he needs for a successful experiment . He 'll ask Mrs. Schiffer if it 's all right to change topics , and she 'll say yes . He 'll study circuits , test his theories , then introduce his inventions into the marketplace . And that woman 's son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had a secret , too . They canceled each other out , maybe . Bean plants for a sleeping bag was pretty much a fair trade considering the ruined science project . His father had already compensated partially with the electronics kit . Now it 's Ben 's turn . He can save his paper route money for a new sleeping bag and his parents wo n't be mad . <p> He starts a load of laundry with his camp clothes and the sheets from last night . He learned how by watching Elsie , though he thinks now she did n't do it right-sometimes she washed just a pair of jeans , some socks . Running a full load is more energy efficient . <p> After Elsie died , Bens parents locked the door to her room from the inside and pulled it shut . Ben could unlock it , put the ice pick in the keyhole . He 'd done it before to play with her Spirograph when she was n't around . In the linen closet he finds sheets and brings them up to his room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bed last night , Benny . " <p> Ben looks at him blankly . <p> " Shit , buddy , what are you , ten now ? You should have stopped that a long time ago . " His eyes rest on Ben 's backpack . " I was going to say you should air out your sleeping bag . " <p> " I lost it . " <p> " You 're grounded , " his father says ; and Ben smiles , he has to . He has sneakers on-the rubber soles automatically ground him . If he were standing in a puddle or leaning against something metal , he would not be grounded . His father made a Tom Swifty ; they could send it to Boys ' Life . <p> " Do n't laugh , I 'm going to have to find the Wee-Alert . " <p> As a little boy , Ben endured rubber sheets and crinkly plastic mattress covers . His parents limited his beverage consumption : He could not drink after six o'clock , seven on weekends ; his father woke him after midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parents returned from Sears with a battery-powered alarm . Two metal clips attached to aluminum sheets were placed beneath Ben 's bed sheet . The first drop of liquid to dampen the paper blotter set off the Wee-Alert . In theory , the device would wake the bed wetter from deep sleep and train the unruly bladder . In practice , the Wee-Alert caused fear of sleep and general anxiety . But it had cured Ben just a few years ago , an outcome the whole family celebrated . <p> First thing Saturday morning , before breakfast , before brushing his teeth , Ben rides his bike . He 's never done this before ; that 's reason enough . He pedals toward the shopping center and stops just as its within sight . He 's not supposed to go by himself . Elsie was always supposed to be with him . He 's not sure what the rules are now . <p> He goes to the library and reads on the carpeted steps of the children 's section . The library 's collection on electronics and electricity is surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When dry , the paper blotter is an insulator , preventing the flow of electricity between the two aluminum sheets . Once wet , the blotter becomes a conductor , completing the circuit and sounding the alarm . Ben finishes the shorter books so he wo n't have to check them out . He pays special attention to the lives of inventors . The risks , the setbacks , the eventual triumph : " Mr. Watson , come here . I want you . " To earn such a moment and to say the right thing when it comes-that 's the challenge . <p> Ben cruises along the sidewalk , swerving onto lawns to avoid people walking their dogs , pedaling hard and then coasting , hard and then coasting . He knows how to ride with no hands , but he does n't feel like it . He breezes past the gateway to the bike path as if he does n't know it 's there . Josh and his friends are probably already skipping stones and fishing rusty cans out of the creek with sticks . <p> The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk in colored chalk . The next morning his father went down to the curb with a hose . " Let the rain take care of it , " his mother said from the porch . He turned the nozzle and water hit the cement full force . Pastel dust rose up like a cigarette puff . <p> Ben pumps up a steep hill , coasts down Parkvale , and stops at his house . Cars are parked in front . People stand on the lawn . <p> His mother sits in the shade of the crab apple tree behind a picnic table piled with his sister 's things . Elsie 's piccolo is for sale , along with her sheet music . Her bicycle . His mother slips a dollar into her jeans pocket . A woman holds Elsie 's sundress up to her daughter and the girl makes a face . <p> Ben goes inside and runs upstairs . The door to Elsie 's room is open for the first time in weeks . His father is dismantling her bed . " Hey , buddy , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls open his dresser drawer for his paper route money . He bounds down the stairs and out the front door . His mother is talking to their neighbor . Both women stop and look at him . <p> " What are you doing to Elsie 's room ? " <p> " It 's going to be a den . Your father can do his actuary work there . " <p> " What 's actuary work ? " <p> " It 's your father 's job . Your father is an actuary . " <p> " Dad 's not an actuary . " <p> " Yes he is . " <p> He picks up his sister 's telephone , a pink plastic thing . " How much for this ? " <p> His mother rises from her chair . Ben touches a stack of sweaters . " How much for these ? " <p> " Save your money , Ben , " his mother says . " Save it for something you really want . " <p> The next day Ben goes to the basement with the kit . He slides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks brand new , its components clean and shiny . A button and a switch . A needle and a dial . Maybe everything has been invented . Toasters , telephones . What do n't people have ? Invisibility devices , time machines , shrink rays . This kit was made by people who did n't know how to invent things for people who did . The boy who owned the kit did n't know-maybe he got killed using it . Some pieces would be scorched if he 'd burned the house down . And the house was still standing when they bought the kit . The kit was fine , just a thing the boy 's mother could n't keep any longer . The boy had been sick . He died before he could invent anything . <p> Ben will invent a device that takes back words once they 're said , sucks them out of the air . Maybe a machine to attach to a typewriter that will beep when the typist misspells a word . Something useful . A robot . Before he can invent , he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to understand . Follow the wires . Some ca n't cross . He knows how to diffuse a bomb-it 's the red and green wires . Do n't cut the yellow . He 'll copy the inventions of others until he understands the basic principles . <p> He 'll write to the U.S. Patent Office for an application and fill it out with his mother 's typewriter . They wo n't have to know he 's ten . By the time they find out , his inventions will have altered the world and they 'll have to take him seriously . <p> This kit would have been good for Elsie , like the Holly Hobby oven . She 'd baked him a cake that smelled dusty like its light bulb heat source . <p> If he 's not careful he could start a fire , he could cut himself on sharp pieces . He might invent something dangerous before the world is ready for the responsibility . Maybe he 'd put his fingers in the wrong place and his parents would find him slumped on the floor , twitching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Upstairs his mother runs water in the sink " Why did you stay down there so long ? " <p> " I thought you 'd call me . " <p> " I thought you 'd come up when you got hungry . " <p> " I did n't get hungry . " <p> He sits on a kitchen chair while his mother loads the dishwasher . She turns the dial and the machine churns . <p> While Ben eats dinner , his mother types a letter to a business that advertises on DC101 . His mother is a part-time secretary for the Amway corporate office . Her electric typewriter hums as she hits the carriage return ; she types eighty words a minute , but her typewriter has a faulty G key . Frustrated , she stacks her scratch copies by the telephone for scrap paper ; Ben 's father says , " Maybe Christmas . " Usually she types her letters at work , on her lunch hour . <p> Ben picks up the onion paper from the table and reads it : <p> Dear DCioi Station Managger : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station plays . Its name is " Cocaine " and it gglorifies drugg use . Please consider the people who listen to your station are families who lead different lives than the superstars who make records . Children listen . <p> He stops reading . The library books piled by his bed should occupy his attention . He needs to learn the basics if he is to kick ass and take names at the science fair . He will take everyone 's name . He 'll make his own crystal radio and tune in to voices from foreign countries , befriend someone whose face he will never see . That 's looking ahead , perhaps prematurely . But that 's what inventors doanticipate the future . Fate transforms ordinary people into inventors . Louis Braille would n't have invented anything if he had n't accidentally blinded himself as a child . He had to invent a way to read . For the first several years of his life Ben has been ordinary , and that 's all right ; he was learning . He looks back on those early years with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennies used to have copper in them and now they have zinc . Copper makes the best conductor of electricity . Ben knows this already and the kids in his class do n't . He 's ahead , like the transfer kid from Vermont who skipped a grade . What you know you can skip . Physical science is cool-it 's over too soon and gives way to history . They memorize the Gettysburg Address , saying it aloud over and over , more times than Lincoln ever did . <p> At lunch the conversations touch on summer vacations briefly before settling on the science fair . <p> " Bean plants ? " Maureen Doyle says . <p> Rico cracks his knuckles and begins singing : " Beans , beans , the musical fruit , the more you eat- " <p> " Shut up , " Ben says . <p> " Make me . " <p> " I do n't make trash , I burn it . " <p> " - the more you eat , the more you toot ! " To punctuate his rhyme , Rico tries to punch Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doyle steps between them . " Ignore him . You 're smarter . " <p> " I 'm just good at memorizing stuff . My bean plants are dead . " <p> Just then Rico circles back , drops to his knees , and punches Ben in the nuts . <p> " Be nice to him , " Maureen Doyle says , " his sister died . " <p> " Were you sad ? " Rico asks . <p> Ben 's eyes tear up . He holds his nuts . " Shut up . " <p> " Make me . " <p> Ben comes home to the sounds of vacuuming . Why is one kind of vacuum noisy and another quiet ? He can devise an experiment to discover the way air moves . He shuts the door to the family room and turns up the TV . Instead of cartoons there 's a show about kids who smoke marijuana laced with PCR They jump offbuildings and die . Elsie died of heart failure . Her body could n't keep the drugs in it . <p> Elsie had straight brown hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she brushed her hair enough and wore her denim jacket , she looked like one of the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders . He wishes he had told her that . <p> Stupid chores hog time from his inventions . He 's got a circuit to complete . Ben throws down the sewer the papers he gets to deliver . No one subscribes to The Thrifty Dime . It 's free , mostly ads . Who would miss it ? <p> Home before the streetlights come on , he makes his way to the unfinished work in the basement . Under fluorescent lights he rearranges wires , breathing with his lips pressed tight , unwilling to make a sound . He awaits the soft wonder of discovery . <p> At dinner his father tells him not to ride on the bike path . <p> But that 's what its for . Ben 's friends are there . It 's safe . <p> " Its not , " his mother says . <p> " How 's the campaign going ? " his father asks . <p> " I sent out ten letters today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic Standard . " <p> " That 's good , " his father says . " How about Mister Action ? " <p> " No , but I wrote Andy Rooney and Erma Bombeck . " <p> ' " Hints from Heloise ' ? " Ben suggests . <p> " Be quiet , Benny , " his father says . <p> " You know what I found out ? I talked to that station manager today , and he said it 's not even a new song . It 's been out for years . " <p> " Why do they still play it ? " <p> " That 's what I said . I said , ' Why do you still play it ? ' " <p> His father waits . Ben waits . <p> ' " People like it , ' he said . They play it because people like it . " <p> As he passes Elsie 's room that night , Ben hears music . His father has put a radio on the windowsill and beneath it his desk . On top is his new TRS-So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape recorder to load programs and save data . He has a thermal printer . He 's not working , he 's just sitting . Then he notices Ben . <p> " Hey , buddy , " he says . <p> Ben 's not sure he 's allowed in . It 's not Elsie 's room anymore . But it 's the same place . He takes two steps onto an Oriental rug he 's never seen before . <p> " I 'm catching up , " his father says . " IfI work at night without distractions , I can catch up on my projects . " <p> He types for a while and then calls Ben over . " I programmed something . " <p> Over and over , the words " Hello Ben " appear on the screen . <p> " Kick . " <p> " What 's ' kick ' ? " <p> " It 's the same as cool . ' " <p> " Kick ? " <p> " Kick . " <p> Ben could learn to program the computer , too . He 'll wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does an actuary do ? " <p> " I manage risk . " <p> Participation in the science fair is mandatory in grades four through eight . Mrs. Schiffer urged her incoming class to start their experiments over the summer so they would be ready in September . No one did except for Ben and Maureen Doyle . If Ben wins , he 'll see his picture in the very newspaper he delivers . Customers will look at the paper and then back at him . " That you ? " they 'll ask . Ben needs a new project , pronto . How long can a paper clip keep a magnetic charge ? <p> He picks up his army men and stores them in an oatmeal box on his shelf . He quits the Scouts . His mother does n't notice . Instead of den meetings Wednesday nights , he 's got his inventions . Life is about choices , even a fifth-grade life . He does n't see much of Iosh anymore . Forget Josh : He does n't concentrate . He lacks vision . He 's hyperactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only serious people-investors , welders , and their spouses-can be around inventors . <p> Ben shouts up the stairs . " Mom ? " <p> " I 'm in the den , " she calls down . <p> She is in Elsies room . He 's never seen his mother use a computer . <p> " Sooner or later we 'll all need to know how to use these , " she says . <p> Ben looks at the green letters on the screen . It seems easy enough . <p> " You 're smart to practice with the electronics kit . You 'll be ready for the computer age . " <p> " What are you doing ? " <p> " More letters . They do n't look as good from the computer , but I can produce them faster . It 's a shame to waste this machine while your fathers at work . " <p> He closes Elsie 's door behind him as he leaves . With the door shut , it 's like Elsie 's in there . <p> He has a kit to work with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped if she 'd found out he 'd been dumping them . They never used to tell on each other , though they often teased each other in sing-songy threats : " I-I-I-I-I 'm gon na tellel-el-el-el Mom and Dad-ad-ad-ad . " <p> Things might have been different if he had had the kit back then . A light to blink twice for yes , once for no . Are you taking drugs ? No . Are you OK ? Yes . Should I tell Mom and Dad ? No . A lie detector , properly administered , would return yes , no , and yes as the right answers . He 'd had the scientific method and had n't applied it . Hypothesis : Elsie is taking drugs . Fact : she has matches in her book bag . Fact : she sits in the back of the bus with Dana Wyatt who was banned from Giant for stealing frozen meat . Fact : people who take drugs like Jimi Hendrix . Fact : Elsie likes Jimi Hendrix . He should have evaluated the evidence and come to a conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The smallest events with her seem vitally important now . He tries to remember all of them . They saw Star Trek : The Motion Picture on his seventh birthday after dinner at Shakey 's . He 'd wanted to go to Tippy 's Taco House , but his mother said they 'd have to wait too long for a table . Elsie had been the one to persuade their parents to take Ben to the movies , that he was n't too young , it was n't a waste of money . Elsie had done that for him when he was too young to do anything for her . <p> He used to sit on her bed and listen as she played her piccolo . She played in the school band for five years and then at Notre Dame Academy , a school for girls where you were n't supposed to take drugs . <p> " Every good boy does fine , " she said , before practicing her scales . " That 's you , Benny . You 're every good boy . You know what else ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember it . " And they did n't have fudge in the house , but Elsie could reach the shelf where his mother saved snacks for lunches . <p> " You get cookies , " Elsie told him , " because you 're a good boy . " <p> Rain beats against the siding outside his bedroom . A thunderstorm rages . What hath God wrought ? Lightning is five times hotter than the sun . A single bolt can contain a million volts of electricity , more than enough to fry Ben Franklin 's nuts . All through the house a current runs . Static rustles his hair , tingles his fingertips . He hears a siren , maybe an ambulance . Just months earlier he would have slipped out of bed and knelt to pray for whoever needed help . The wail dies down , and he knows he 'll be able to sleep . In the morning he can create a siren with his kit . There 's no limit to what he can make . He could build something to shock his teachers at school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car battery , watch people jump back . He will destroy Maureen Doyle and Rico , too . Before anyone knows what 's going on , he 'll attach the clamps from the Wee-Alert to the front of Rico 's trousers and fry his nuts . It is altogether fitting and proper to do so . <p> Urine is 95 percent water and it contains small amounts of sodium , potassium , and calcium . Water does not . Both liquids act as a conductor for electricity . Hence , lifeguards clear the pool during thunderstorms . Electricity might not have the same connectivity in urine as it does in water . How could he test that hypothesis ? He could improve the Wee-Alert to discern water from urine , to buzz in different pitches to signal which fluid had trespassed . It had a limited use . At the fair he would need a volunteer to urinate . He could do it himself but the crowd would be more impressed if he stood back from the experiment while his assistant urinated . Josh might do . <p> He listens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transistor radio under his pillow , his Wee-Alert turned on , the current above and beneath the sheets . Through the pillow he hears John Cougar , then Olivia Newton-John . Q107 wo n't play " Cocaine . " The DJ tries to figure out if the Go-Gos are new wave or punk . One blink for new wave , two for punk . And he 's asleep . <p> Though the science fair notice has been on the refrigerator for days , it 's not a good time to mention it . Not when pulpy shreds of The Thrifty Dime clog gutters all down their street , the overflow of storm drains . The papers did n't get dropped off on his lawn last Thursday , and when he called to let the dispatcher know , a woman told him his route had been reassigned . <p> He sees no reason to view this as a setback . Though research requires capital , it 's no longer necessary to compromise . He wo n't ride around the neighborhood with an unseemly newspaper sack slung over his handlebars . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He hears a crash and runs to see what fell . His father stands in the center of Elsies room looking down at the shattered black plastic . Ben ca n't fix the radio , but he might harvest its parts . Was it the cocaine song ? Ben tries not to be ashamed of him . <p> " Wheres your mother ? " <p> " Lying down . " <p> " She 's tired . " <p> " She wrote letters all afternoon . She makes each one different . " <p> " We knew about your sister , " his father says . " The reefer . " <p> " What 's reefer ? " <p> ' " Pot . " <p> His father tells him he had n't worried about Elsie because he thought she was only smoking pot with the kids on the bike path . Lots of kids did that and they did n't die . In fact , when he was in high school , he himself smoked reefer with other members of the marching band . <p> Ben crouches to pick up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> His father looks into the pile . " I guess so . " <p> " You were in the band ? " <p> His father nods . <p> " Like Elsie ? " <p> Sometimes Ben brings in the mail when he gets home from school , but lately he leaves it for his mother . Either way she lifts the lid of the mailbox and reaches inside . <p> Today she sits on the porch with the mail until Ben 's father comes home . She hands him a letter . <p> Ben tries to read it upside down . " What 's it say ? " <p> His father folds it shut . " Congratulations , honey . " <p> " They wo n't play the song before nine at night , " his mother says . <p> After dinner his father puts the dishes in the sink and goes up to Elsies room . His mother sits with the phone book . Ben gathers his equipment . All the parts fit in his backpack and reassemble with ease . He rides his bike to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the site of Bingo and band concerts . Ben sets up his experiment on a table near the other fifth graders . He stands a perfectly good chance of getting a ribbon-prizes are awarded for each grade level . <p> Practicality called for a scaled-down experiment-a pillowcase instead of a sheet , a beaker for urine in lieu of an assistant to pee on cue . He lowered the voltage from a car battery to six D cells . He does n't want to electrocute anyone . Not fatally . The Wee-Alert connects to the kit through a simple interface of copper wire and two clips . <p> He views his competitors with professional curiosity . Josh constructed a device to enable people to stare at eclipses without damaging their vision . Another kid made a plaster volcano erupt baking soda and vinegar . Maureen Doyle turned celery leaves red by adding food coloring to the water in which the stalks stand . In stenciled letters and Day-Glo poster paint , her lab report explains how plants use water ; if neatness counts , she 's the obvious winner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular . With two pushpins , string , and a pencil , he inscribed unsteady ovals onto stiff white cardboard . <p> Ben keeps an eye peeled for Rico . Jumper cables under the table stand ready to fry his nuts , to teach him to shut his stupid face . He 's not sure how bad it will hurt or how much damage it might do-there 's really no way to test it . <p> The seventh grade science teacher crouches down to peer at the Wee-Alert . " I do n't see any application for this , " she says . <p> " What 's the application , " Ben says slowly , scientifically , " of red celery ? " <p> Mrs. Schiffer puts her hand on Ben 's shoulder . " Did your parents help you , Benny ? " <p> " I invented it , " he says . <p> She scans the room . " Where are your parents ? " <p> Ben says nothing . He 's glad they are n't here to witness Rico 's project . They 're spared knowing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Author Affiliation
