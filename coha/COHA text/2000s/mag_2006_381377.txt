Until recently , Barbaro  --  the majestic 3-year-old Thoroughbred who stormed to victory in the Kentucky Derby in May  --  seemed to be recovering nicely after sustaining a severe break in his right leg during the May 20 Preakness Stakes . But after surgery on July 8 to replace hardware and clear up an infection in that leg , doctors found and treated an abscess in his previously healthy left foot . But the inflammation worsened : Barbaro had developed laminitis , a breakdown of the tissue joining his foot bone and hoof . <P> Laminitis , which is caused by favoring an injured leg and putting too much weight on the healthy ones , can be so painful that Barbaro 's doctors considered whether to put the horse down rather than let him suffer . His surgeon Dean Richardson at one point listed his prognosis as poor . But Barbaro fought back like a champion . At week 's end , his appetite and spirits , if not yet his body , seemed healthy . " As long as the horse is not suffering , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's worth the effort . "
