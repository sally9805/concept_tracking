The Rio Grande should be repaired sooner or later because it 's a shame what happened to it which is not pretty . Irrigation and all and no sturgeon any more and pubic hairs and pollution . <p>  --  Harve Benedict , English 12 , Elfego Baca High School O hundreds and hundreds of Harves , your writing should have been the death of me . It should have been . <p> In my memory I picture you and our off-white high-school cinderblock classroom , the stinking heated air , imbalanced orange plastic chairs and desks , **27;1159;TOOLONG fluorescence , spittled spatter-pattern tiles , and smeared chalkboards . More alone with my lesson plans than I had planned , I pay tribute , seat you , take attendance , mark you present but gone . <p> Gone . And missed . <p> Even the ass-kissing or dispassionate or self-obsessed wastedslacker slumming hopeless worst of you Harves are still dangerously present in me . <p> For the record , I should mark down that my grade books were amiss because I made a place across twelve columns to record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whim , the other matters at hand . <p> I had slots in my books for the good shit , for the shit , for the rewrite second shot , for the wasted second shot . I had a slot I could make you fit . <p> I have all the grade books . In thirty years of teaching they are the only books I wrote . <p> You knew firsthand my forms of insult to The Teaching Profession , so you would understand that I remember you best just when I have my pants around my ankles , my testicles in hand , fumbling with my most ordinary means of communication , my praxis and true praxis , my imagined spheres of influence , my twin inadequate vocabularies , my theses , my parallel narratives and my pure lyric impulses , my flesh 's synonyms and soul 's antonyms . My syllabi . <p> My syllabi . There , that clarifies , that has a ring . <p> I willed the essays you wrote to define but not defy the audience . I wanted your words , I willed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring true . And because I had been taught the dry , exhausted world would operate neither on beauty 's truth nor truth 's beauty , I knew from the beginning what curriculum I would teach you . <p> So , I repeat , I repeat myself as I self-examine , passing my fingertips like blind mandibles over the puckered , seamed curtain of my scrotum to discover the drama growing upon the drama within . Oh , I imagine I see you , see your eyes spin , the light in them dimming , as they always did when , in my less naked days , I exercised my prerogatives and lectured at you , poking parts of the enlarged diagrammed sentence I pinned to the cork strip at the top of the scored chalkboard . <p> Are you as embarrassed as I am by this admission into evidence of my two mortgages , two secret business files , yang and yang , And and Ampersand , my letter home and letter back , my Brothers Grimm , my Brothers Grimm ? Embarrassing . <p> It is embarrassing . Goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O hundreds and hundreds of Harves , I bent your attention from the words you had written to what I called " the matter at hand " to which we gave our concentration whether or not your essay was a yelp in the dark , a wild song meant to break you from the ranks of the marching . <p> I dynamited the secret daily deepening love for learning inside any of you who had the elemental need for beauty and brutality within . Strictly according to my orders , you obediently rode your hands and the nubs of your pens over the surface of the page in order to not enter , not swim in where your unsleeping secrets and first and final doubts might appear unhidden . <p> Your sparking faces reignite in my memory , and will not be drowned out as I drowned them out then . Self-loathing , self-loving , self-avoiding , I am self-examining , self-examining my classifieds , my want ads , questioning , and indulging , indulging and indulging my excesses of selfintimacy . <p> My motives will never be unugly , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassion I lacked made me ask you back any question you asked . <p> In a race against you dambreakers , I made dams . Wanting language to have use , I demanded you learn how to change its natural course , to divert it , drain every untamed cubic foot . <p> Of course . You knew , know that . <p> Do you remember ? When you picture me , is this what you picture ? <p> Showered and powdered . A midday desert storm makes the bathroom light fixture tremble , and the water swirling down the drain flashes at me like a whip snake . <p> The lights in my home are lowered and curtains drawn . I know my curriculum , my medical routine as one of " the predisposed , " as one of cancer 's pupils . <p> Goddamned . Oh , I do not want to remember , but I remember the hundreds of sentence-suffering student conferences with my chipped , unbalanced metal desk between us in my designated space of the giant communal school office . <p> There was weed and fast-food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the backs of your neck and hands sunburned and your palms blistered . <p> Nothing on either side of " because " seemed to flow right for you . O Harve , Harve Discussion-Killer , Harve Chain-Yanker  --  son of fourthgeneration Mesilla Valley cotton farmers-class of ' 90 ? ' 91 ?  --  second-sem junior Goth metalhead brilliant nonachiever  --  emerald goatee , emerald short spiked hair , mucous-coated skull ring hanging from your septum . <p> You wrote , The Rio Grande should be fixed because it 's a fuckin shame what happened to it . <p> " Harve , " I said , " what part should be repaired ? It 's a big river . " <p> You said , " The whole thing . " I said , " It 's a long river . " <p> You said , " Repair it , then . Do n't fix it . " <p> " It 's best to focus , Harve . " " Fuck you , " you said . <p> " And when  --  you should say when . " I asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yeah . " <p> " Listen . Can you put when ' in ? " <p> You said , " Fuck you . " I said , " Would you put when ' in ? " <p> You pinched the feet of the crucified Christ on your homemade earring , and you kind of put " when " in : The Rio Grande should be repaired sooner or later because it 's a fuckin shame what happened to it which is not pretty . <p> That 's better , I said , not believing my own words . Believing only in the complete sentence , I disliked your added fragment , which you would not change : Irrigation and all and no sturgeon any more and pubic hair and pollution . <p> O Harve , O hundreds and hundreds  --  with any luck , you have n't thought of me for years . I wish this for you : that I am dismissed , expelled , that I never come to mind , that I am your lost but replaceable crutch tips , your unrefillable prescriptions , the lecture notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get . <p> O you hundreds and hundreds of Harves missing the " because " gene , I have poured you in and poured you out of my bifocal lenses , I have insisted that we bow to the matter at hand , the curriculum , the curriculum , but I have needed , wanted your flooding truth to kill what I have been . For thirty years . <p> Now , I have my immutable troubles and truths , such as they are , unwarranted radials , **26;1188;TOOLONG hard disk drives , my riches , my riches , out in the poor light , though I understand that looking will not help me . I go by touch . <p> For thirty years I have made the same mean wrong wishes  --  to identify instead of know  --  to reach instead of search  --  and a third I could not or would not name : to put an end to anything that simply is . You , my matter at hand , my own overproductive , overeager metastasizing cells , have tumesced in me for three decades of daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You have taught me . You have taught me . <p> How blessedly terrifying to search for and know you , the truths gathering , gathering within me . You have grown upon and will destroy me . <p> <p> By Kevin McIlvoy <p>
