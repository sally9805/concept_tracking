<p> The mattress pads in the death-row cells of San Quentin State Prison are unusually thin . But former gang godfather and convicted murderer Stanley " Tookie " Williams has made that a virtue . He rolls his up tight , binds it together with shoelaces , and sets it on end . From that makeshift stool , using his metal bed frame as a desk , Mr. Williams writes books for children , warning them of the life he led and now rues . " I have to ad lib , " says Williams in a phone interview from his cell . " You do a lot of that in here . " Indeed , Williams 's life has been full of ingenuity and surprises . But perhaps none so great as the recent announcement that he has been nominated for next year 's Nobel Peace Prize by a member of the Swiss parliament . Williams is co-founder of the Crips , a gang rooted in <p> 1971 South Central Los Angeles but now with copycats scattered around the globe . But it 's what Williams has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past 19 years - that has brought him a Nobel nomination . He has created a cottage industry of programs to help at-risk youths in the United States and abroad to avoid gang life . He 's written nine books and created several anticrime programs run by the nonprofit Neighborhood House for North Richmond , not far from San Quentin . While Williams 's works have received wide recognition , including support from corporations like Kraft Foods and funding from the US Department of Justice , honoring him as a Nobel nominee is controversial and sure to play into the national debate over the death penalty . For opponents of capital punishment , Williams 's accomplishments are testimony to the power and usefulness of a life turned around . For supporters of the death penalty , the nomination is the ultimate affront to victims everywhere . Williams was convicted of four murders , which he denies committing . <p> Reverse role model For Tandrea Nix , a sixth-grader in tan pants and a black nylon jacket , Williams is a kind of reverse role model . Tandrea is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a converted duplex apartment building in North Richmond , a community with an ever present whiff of oil in the air , thanks to nearby refineries , and a per capita annual income of $ 4,500 . The children are participating in a project begun by Williams and administered by Neighborhood House that provides mentoring and resources , like Internet access , to spread an antigang message . In a dim upstairs room with windows covered by metal mesh , Tandrea is reading aloud from one of Williams 's books to a group of children bused here from their homes after school . Tandrea explains Williams 's message to a visitor simply : " It teaches us not to grow up like him . " Growing up for Williams meant an early introduction into the tough street life of South Central Los Angeles . He and his mother moved there by bus from Louisiana in the early 1960s . His first exploration of his new neighborhood led to a fight with the local bully , an experience Williams says convinced him that being bigger , tougher , and stronger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 , Williams and a friend founded the Crips gang , which begat heightened street violence and , ultimately , a couple of robberies and four murders that landed Williams on death row . He is appealing those convictions by requesting new evidentiary hearings . <p> Slow conversion Williams 's transition from gang leader to gang opponent was not sudden . Gang affiliations and animosities follow their members into prison , and San Quentin authorities were immediately suspicious of Williams . Convinced he was behind a budding gang power struggle , prison officials sent Williams to " the hole , " a place where even minimal prison liberties are denied , where he stayed for seven years . It was there , says Williams , that the conversion began . " It did n't happen overnight , " he says . " It was n't an epiphany . It was gradual , and that 's what made it more effective - not like one of those crash diets where it does n't last , " he chuckles . " He 's proof that someone can change the direction of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Mario Fehr , who , along with five fellow members of the Swiss Parliament , put forth Williams 's Nobel nomination . Williams is soft-spoken and , while not formally educated , clear and articulate . He credits God for making his life productive , and voracious reading for his impressive vocabulary . His favorite books : the Bible , the dictionary , and a thesaurus . Williams 's work and conversion have been given a strong helping hand by Barbara Becnel , executive director of the Neighborhood House . They met when she sought him out as a source for a book she is writing on the history of L.A. gangs . She became a conduit for his programs outside prison , including the books , which he dictates to her over the phone . She edits them and does the leg work to see them into print . Ms. Becnel 's initial quest for a publisher in the early 1990s failed . Only one was interested , but wanted a blood-and-guts inside account of gang life , which Williams rejected . She then took the idea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked from booth to booth . She found a taker , and the series of books was published in 1996 . Another book , " Life in Prison , " was published in 1998 , and presents a harrowing account of prison existence that has been applauded by juvenile-justice officials , as well as educators and young people . Becnel says Williams gets no proceeds from the books . Rather , earnings are funneled into his antigang activities . Williams founded the Internet Project for Street Peace , a Web site that allows at-risk youths to talk to each other in chat rooms . Right now , the network involves American teens talking to Somali immigrants in Switzerland . Eventually , the program will connect with black youths in South Africa , too . Gang life in the style of South Central L.A. has clearly gone global . Becnel recalls her astonishment on a trip to South Africa , when she visited Pollsmoor Prison , where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated , and noticed prisoners making hand symbols identifying themselves as followers of the Crips . <p> Little sympathy Because of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged by gangs , Williams gets no sympathy from victims-rights groups and death-penalty proponents . " We work very hard not to allow murderers to become celebrities . We find it insulting to the victims , because it just casts the victims aside , " says Jan Miller , president of Citizens Against Homicide . Whatever good work Williams is doing today , says Miller , can not negate his earlier crimes , nor should it affect his punishment . Mr. Fehr , the Swiss Parliamentarian , makes clear that the Nobel nomination is intended to honor Williams , as well as call attention to the injustice of the death penalty . " This will help push the death-penalty debate to a higher level , " says Fehr from Zurich . Of course , winning the Nobel Prize remains a long shot for Williams , who is just one of more than 100 nominations . But in terms of the debate over the death penalty , simply being a nominee will heighten the controversy that is sure to follow if Williams 's legal appeals are exhausted and his execution scheduled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams embodies a different , more pragmatic contention . If his life now accomplishes a social good , supporters argue , why end it ? <p> ( c ) Copyright 2000 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
