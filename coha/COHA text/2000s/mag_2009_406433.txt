America 's economic firestorm has torched the collecting arena , too  --  the frenzied buying that drove prices to unimaginable heights a year ago is over . But here 's the bright side : buyers now have the upper hand . How should they use it ? EDITED BY SARAH MEDFORD EXPERTS AGREE : With the speculators gone and the serious buyers remaining , many areas of the art and collecting markets are not only safe but ripe for another look . " This is an opportunity for everyone to calm down , " says Michael Findlay , a director of Acquavella Galleries , in New York City . " The frosting has been taken off the cake , but it 's a very rich cake underneath . " With the spring auctions and art fairs at hand , Town &; Country asked Findlay and five other experts in areas ranging from fine wines to contemporary design for their advice on navigating the current landscape . In these turbulent economic times , it turns out , you can still find a refuge in beauty  --  and it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ILLUSTRATION BY OLAF HAJEK MICHAEL FINDLAY , director , Acquavella Galleries , New York City , on modern masters and classic post-World War II art : I 'd compare prices for a highly touted contemporary artist versus a well-known deceased artist , like Mir . If you pay $3 million for a good late Mir , you 're getting a work by someone who is in the history books  --  that 's not true of some contemporary artists . And look at living artists of great historical significance , people like James Rosenquist and Lucian Freud  --  both of whom we represent  --  or Frank Stella and Helen Frankenthaler . People who have kept on the cutting edge and whose prices are really reasonable compared with prices of the most recent generation . They have not been part of the fashionable mix , though they have sales and exhibits and global reputations . acquavellagalleries.com .

I 'm finding that there is a resurgence of interest in the value of the classical , traditional pieces  --  really good mid-18th-century pieces . For example , we recently sold a great pair of open-armed chairs by William Hallett 1707-1781 for about a half million dollars . Last year it might have been considered an old-fashioned taste ; this year it 's just a more long-lasting taste . I 'd look for a good piece that came from a designer 's stable and a provenance that indicates it came from a well-known house or collection or that a respected designer like 18th-century architect Robert Adam commissioned it . In the past year prices have come down by about 20 to 25 percent . We 're on a long plateau  --  English furniture tends to have a plateau in prices and then a sharp step-up . The step-up will come as soon as people feel more comfortable in the economic climate . mallettantiques.com . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Beijing , on Chinese contemporary art : For a while , you could sell anything that was Chinese . That 's no longer the case . Find a good adviser , and check out what you like . Go where people are not going . For that , you need courage and you need to learn . I 'm still buying mature artists , like Huang Yong Ping or Zhang Xiaogang , filling in the holes in my collection . Last fall , Zhang 's Sailor ( Girl ) , from 2004 , fetched $482,500 at Sotheby 's ; Huang 's works sell for much less . Photograph : Guy Ullens and his wife , Myriam . But now we are promoting the younger generation . There 's an extraordinary video that was at the Ullens Center ; it 's by Wang Gongxin , and it mixes pictures of top models and ordinary young Chinese ladies wearing Dior . And there is someone from Taiwan I love : Wu Chi-Tsung , who used a lens and a metal thread to make a video projection suggesting an old Chinese landscape that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sotheby 's international wine department , on wine : Younger wines are an especially good value , and it is better to buy wines from the last ten or twelve years if you are setting up a collection . It is probably true to say that today winemakers , whether from Europe or the Americas , are at the top of their form  --  there has been huge technological progress , and competition also makes everyone even keener . And climatically , the world is making riper wines that you can drink younger . Wines worthy of collecting are generally those that cost more than $50 a bottle and are not in mass distribution . Regarding Bordeaux , obviously a 1995 or 1996 is cheaper than a rare 1961 . All are good vintages . It 's worth searching out top producers with large properties rather than those with very small estates : in Bordeaux , a bottle from the tiny Le Pin , for instance , would be more expensive than a bottle from Chteau Talbot . sothebys.com . NICHOLAS HALL , cohead of Christie 's international department , Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a safe place  --  not to invest , but a place where collectors wo n't lose . The appetite to acquire Old Master pictures is not going anywhere . There were more bidders in December 2008 than there were in December 2007 . There are Old Master artists who actually knew how to draw and can be had for $150,000 , versus the contemporary-art doodle that you 'd get for that amount . Francesco Guardi , for example . Unlike with other categories , there 's no reason to wait and see what will happen ; what 's more , our estimates are probably down by about 10 to 20 percent . There 's a revival of interest in early and Renaissance Italian painting . Dutch painting sales remain very good too . It 's as good a time now to buy a Rembrandt as it was in 2007. christies.com . R. CRAIG MILLER , curator of design arts and director of design initiatives , Indianapolis Museum of Art , on contemporary design : There will be more interest in this market in the future . But there are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what their significant works are . That 's what we 're trying to do with our exhibitions . The American masters include Robert Venturi , Michael Graves , Frank Gehry . Venturi has stopped designing small objects . I 'd look at his work from the ' 70s and ' 80s ; you have distance from that body of work . The European blue chips  --  there are a good dozen . In Great Britain there are Ron Arad and Jasper Morrison . In France , Philippe Starck and Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec . Mark Newson goes between London and Paris . In Italy , Michele De Lucchi and Antonio Citterio . In Germany , Konstantin Grcic . In Holland , Hella Jongerius , Jurgen Bey and Marcel Wanders .
