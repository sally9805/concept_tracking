Only the fog is real . Only the sand . Only the crashing of the sea upon the restless shore . The rest is a dream . It has to be . I say it again and again until I believe it , because I can not be here . Not now . Not with mist dusting my eyelashes , sand tickling my toes , salt bitter on my lips . Not when the whole world has narrowed to a strip of beach , a puff of fog , and a single gull crying in an invisible sky . <br> This is crazy . Impossible . And I 'm too old for crazy . I wo n't be some loony old woman with a house full of cats . I refuse to be . <br> Besides , I prefer dogs . <br> I touch my neck , and my breath stops . The chain is gone . My locket . <br> My mothers voice teases me . " Not impossible , hon. Improbable . Because with God all things are possible . " Her words , spoken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheezy with age . I hear her again . " Someday youll lose that locket , Thea Jean . You just wait . " Her grin turns the sides of her eyes into folds of old parchment . " And thats when the adventure will really begin . " <br> But I do n't want any adventure . All I want is a comfortable chair , a good book , the sounds of my grandchildren playing tag under the California sun , and my boxer at my feet . <br> I want to go home . <br> I glance out over the ripples of Monterey Bay . White-capped waves . Dark water . And then I know . Thats what I need to wake me up , get me home . I need a cold slap in the face . Something to shake me from this crazy-old-cat-lady delusion . <br> I stride forward until the surf kisses my feet , the waves swirl around my ankles , knees , waist , arms . Cold . Icy . Welcome . <br> The water engulfs me . And suddenly it does n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Kinna Henley as she fell to her knees and pawed in the sand . The grains bit into her hands , filled her fingernails like black soot . And still she dug . Deep into the oozing wetness . Deep enough to bury her sin . Or at least the evidence of it . <br> No , not sin . She would n't call it that . Desperation , maybe . Determination . But not sin . God would n't bless that , and He had to bless today . He just had to . She was betting everything on it . <br> Kinna glanced over her shoulder . Somewhere , a gull cried . Once . Only once . Somewhere , water broke along rocks and sand . Somewhere , the sun rose over the horizon . <br> But not here . <br> Here , there was nothing but the fog and the shore and the sand beneath her fingers . Alone . <br> Barren . <br> She hated that word . <br> With a deep breath , Kinna reached into the pocket of her nurse 's smock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name . She held them in her palm . Minute bits of liquid shimmered in the bottoms , reflecting only gray , all that was left of the medication that held her hope , flowed through her veins , and ended in her ovaries . Expensive medication she could n't afford on her own . But she needed it . She 'd tried too long , prayed too long , believed too longfor nothing . <br> This medication , this Perganol , would change all that . It had to . <br> She closed her fist . <br> What 's done is done . I had to take it , God . Do n't You see ? I had to . <br> She turned her hand over , opened it , and dropped the vials into the hole . Then she covered them and pushed a fat , heavy rock over the top . <br> Gone . Buried . <br> She would n't think of how those vials had been accidentally sent to the hospital . Of how they were supposed to be returned . Of how she said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket of her smock instead . She 'd told herself it did n't matter , no one would know , no one would care , no one would be hurt . She made herself believe this <br> was the only way . And it was . Nothing else had worked . Not charting her temperature , not a million tests , not herbal remedies , not two failed attempts at adoption . Not even prayer . <br> A dozen long years of it all had taught her that . God promised happily ever after , but so far , all she 'd gotten was month after month of disappointment , pain , and the fear that nothing may ever change . <br> But now , change would come . The medication was gone , the vials hidden , her ovaries full to bursting . <br> Finally . <br> A sound came . A shout , maybe . Kinna leapt up and turned , but no one was there . No one walking down the beach . No one swimming in the surf . No one making sandcastles along the shore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not remember the first time she had knelt in this sand , dug in it , made castles at the edge of the water . She would n't remember the boy who made her believe fairy tales could come true . Or what happened between them after that . <br> That was gone . Past . All that remained was the promise that had flowed out of those stolen vials and into her blood . That was all that mattered . <br> Today , everything would change . <br> Kinna picked up her bag and strode down the silent beach , her elbows bent , her arms swinging . Fast , determined . Five minutes up , five minutes back , turn and go again . Twice more , and she 'd check exercise off her list for the day . Once , she exercised for fun . Now , it was a means to an end , a way to prepare her body , to convince herself that she was doing everything she could , everything she should . That 's what life had become . <br> She sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one who laughed easily , who teased , who jogged along the beach just to feel the breeze in her hair and to smell the salty scent of the sea . The Kinna who still believed in fairy tales . <br> But soon she would believe again . She would laugh , tease , but not jog . Not for nine months , anyway . Because now her dreams would come true and the pain would end . God would finally do for her what she 'd asked , begged , and pleaded for so many years . <br> Once , she 'd been so sure that God would answer . So sure of her faith . God would not disappoint her , would not let her down . But the years eroded that faith , washing it away , bit by bit , as surely as the sea washed out the sand on the shore . <br> Until today . <br> Now she had faith again . She would stop being that woman filled with pain and doubt . She would be filled with faithand more . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or at least , nurse 's orders . <br> God did n't answer . <br> But it did n't matter . She 'd waited long enough . Tried , prayed , hoped . And finally , she 'd happened upon those vials as if they were meant for her . As though it did n't matter if she just slipped them into her pocket . A simple act . Easy . So why did she still have to bury them in the sand ? <br> She knew the signs of guilt . Growing up as a pastor 's daughter taught her that . She knew a lot about guilt . <br> I did what I had to do . That 's all . I ca n't live like this anymore . It 's got to change . <br> She 'd done what she never would have believed . Kinna Henley had become a thief . <br> She gripped her bag until it creased in her hand , pressing into the flesh of her fingers . Once , she 'd wept and stormed , screamed and threatened . She 'd sobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slammed too many doors . <br> Until now . <br> A chill slipped under her nurse 's smock and twirled around the short hairs near her neck . It was so cold here , so lonely . Not even the call of a gull or the chatter of a sea lion kept her company . Nothing but endless waves and the eerie silence of the mist . <br> And God , just as silent . <br> This time , God , do n't let me down . Please Not again . <br> This time she 'd made plans , acted on them . This time , she 'd sold her soul . No , it 's not that bad . It 's not ! <br> <br> What if ? What if I fail again ? <br> But it would n't come to that . It could n't . <br> God would listen . God would relent . <br> Kinna did n't want fame or fortune , shoes , clothes , or the latest Prada handbag . She did n't want a new car , a new house , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a baby of her own . What she 'd always wanted , as long as she could remember . A husband , a baby , and happily ever after . <br> Did n't God say that to His faithful ? Did n't He say that all she had to do was pray ? How could it be too much to ask for only what every other woman in the world seemed to have ? Just a baby . To be a mother . Nothing more . It seemed so simple , so normal , so impossible . <br> This was her last chance . At least that 's what the doctor said . " One more cycle , Kinna . " Cycles , not months . Everything was measured in cycles now . " And then you need to consider in vitro fertilization . " <br> But she could n't afford IVF . She could n't even afford Perganol . The credit cards were maxed , the house mortgaged and mortgaged again . And Jimmy had said no more debt . <br> She closed her eyes . She 'd done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamins , eaten her vegetables , not allowed a drop of caffeine to touch her lips , walked each afternoon . She 'd charted her basal body temperature for a week , logged the dates , bought not one but two ovulation predictor kits with seven sticks each . She 'd tested every day , twice a day , from day eleven to day fifteen . And this day , the time was finally right  --  the perfect time to conceive . <br> And , of course , there were the vials . <br> Around her , the fog swirled and thickened . The ocean murmured words of doubt . She would n't listen to that . Not anymore . <br> She kicked a bit of sand at her feet . A string of dried kelp slid between her toes and sandals . She flicked it away , then reached into her bag and took out the ovulation predictor stick she 'd put there . Two lines , both thick , equal . She squeezed it in her hand and then pulled a picture from her bag , a funny photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The perfect baby . <br> Her thumb brushed the baby 's face . She blinked . <br> Stop it , Kinna . God would n't let you f ind that picture if He did n't intend to answer your prayers . She glanced up . Do n't forget , God . I have faith . <br> Kinna reached the end of the beach and turned . Then she saw a glimmer in the sand . Silver buried in the tan-and-white blanket of a million tiny grains . She stooped and picked up the long chain , the dull necklace . She turned it over . An oval locket , old and worn . She grimaced . She had one just like it , except hers was new . A gift from Jimmy , who claimed it was an original . How like him to get a cheap knockoff and pretend it was something more . <br> She ran her finger over the intricate double-tulip design on the locket 's surface . She opened it , and a bit of sand fell onto her fingers . She brushed it away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman , their faces wrinkled but still unfaded by time , clear enough that she could see their smiles , could tell they were happy . <br> Happy faces , content faces , his half hidden behind thick glasses , hers yellowed by the years . Faces that made her ache . Once , she thought she would look happy like that when she grew old . She and Jimmy . And they would . Just as soon as God answered her prayers . <br> Kinna closed the locket , dropped it into her bag , and listened as the chain rattled against the ovulation stick . And then someone screamed . <br> Someone get me a cat , because I think I really have lost my mind . What was I thinking ? This is n't a dream . The water is real . Too real . God is making fun of me , sending me here like this . <br> But it 's not His fault I 'm in these waves . I should n't blame Him . I 've done this stupid thing . Batty old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd laugh , except my mouth would fill with salt water . It claws at me with freezing fingers Reaches , grabs , forces my head under its black surface . And then I feel the first tendrils of fear . Of real , honest-to-goodness terror . <br> What have I done ? <br> I fight and scream . My arms flail , my hands wave in air too gray , too heavy . The waves pull at me , drag me farther from the shore . My eyes go blind in the salty surf . <br> One wave . Another . I shout again . <br> My throat burns and I can no longer scream . Stupid . Crazy . Nuts . <br> The water grows colder . Arms of ice , embracing , drawing me down . Pulling me to the land of many cats . <br> Maybe I should have known . Should have seen the truth the moment I knew the locket was gone . Maybe . . . <br> But this is crazy . <br> This is real . <br> This . . . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <br> <br> Kinna whirled toward the sound of the scream . <br> It came again , a shriek like a blade across her nerves . She faced the water . The sound echoed off the waves . <br> A cry . A shout . A scream for help . <br> She heard frantic splashing , a final , desperate cry . She threw her bag onto the sand and raced to the edge of the sea . <br> There ! She could see the figure now , a black shadow on the water 's surface . <br> A wave crested and the figure vanished . No other sound came . Kinna kicked off her shoes and dove into the water . Cold surrounded her . Waves plunged against her , stinging her eyes , lifting her higher , crashing her down . <br> For an instant she glimpsed the figure in the water . A woman , older than Kinna , her arms thrashing , her head dipping beneath the waves . Sounds came again . Words and shouts that she could no longer distinguish . <br> The woman went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hard . Fast . Fighting against the surf and current . Water silenced any further sounds , filled her ears with only the roar of the tide . Stroke , stroke , breathe . Water in her mouth . Salt and bitterness . She paused , glanced up . She could n't see the woman . <br> Oh no . God , help <br> A flash . An arm . Was that ? Then , nothing . <br> She swam toward the spot . Hoping , praying . Though God had never answered her before , still she prayed , believing , driving herself into the undulating waves . <br> And then she was there . A froth of white on the surface of the sea . Floundering limbs . Gulping mouth . A final stroke and she was beside the woman , then behind her . <br> " It 's okay . I 've got  --  " A wave silenced her words , drowning them in a salty onslaught . <br> The woman thrashed . Her arm slammed against Kinna 's temple . The world turned black , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . <br> The woman twisted and reached out , shouting words Kinna could n't hear , could n't understand . She started to climb , thin feet kicking into Kinna 's legs . Weak hands , suddenly strong , shoved Kinna 's shoulders deeper into the roiling waves . <br> Water closed over Kinna 's head . She shoved the woman away , fought back to the surface . Air stung her lungs , water blinded her eyes . <br> The woman grabbed for her , but this time , Kinna was ready . She grasped the woman beneath the arms , turning her by force . A foot impacted her stomach . A hand scratched her face . <br> She shouted in the woman 's ear . " Relax ! I 've got you . " <br> The woman shuddered . <br> " Do n't fight me . " <br> Stiff arms stopped clawing . Kicking legs slowed . <br> " That 's it . Stay loose now . " <br> Kinna secured her grip , turned on her side , and swam one-armed toward the shore . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . " <br> The woman 's breath rasped in Kinna 's ear . She would be all right . They would make it safely to the shore . <br> A wave broke over them and still she swam , the woman pliable but breathing . A gasp . A cough . The waves came quicker , pushing them . Short , choppy , breaking in rolls of froth . <br> Then Kinna 's toes found the bottom . She fought against the last of the surf , the final stretch of the sea . Her feet pressed into soggy sand , her body rose from the water . And then they were free . <br> Kinna dragged the woman onto the beach and fell to her knees beside her . She spat out a mouthful of water , then leaned , trembling , over the woman 's pale face . <br> The woman 's eyes fluttered open and fixed on Kinna . " You ? " A single word , barely spoken . Then her eyes fell closed . <br> " No ! " Kinna grabbed the woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's eyes opened again , staring . Her mouth moved , muttering words Kinna could not hear . <br> She leaned closer . <br> " The faces . Not crazy . Not . " The words were slurred . " Not a dream . " The woman 's head tilted , her breath ragged and unsure . <br> " Shhh . We 'll get you to a doctor . You 'll be all right . " <br> A hand gripped Kinna 's arm . The woman 's fingers tightened and pulled her closer . Her mouth moved again , and this time , the words were clear . <br> " You 're Kinna Henley . " <br> Kinna shivered . " How do you know me ? " <br> The woman gave another shuddering breath , then fell back . <br> And breathed no more . <br> Continues ...
