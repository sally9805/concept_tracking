Prologue Entibor : An-Jemayne Eraasi : sus-Peledaen Orbital Station On a world not his own , in a life he had never anticipated , Arekhon sus-Khalgath sus-Peledaen sleptand sleeping , dreamed . In his dream he knelt in the meditation chamber of the starship **26;211;TOOLONG , where he had not gone in his waking body for over a dozen years . His staff , a cubit and a half of black wood bound with silver , lay on the deck in front of him , and all around him the Daughter vibrated with the urgency of her passage through the Void . Arekhon wondered what he was meant to do . Had he only now begun his meditation , here inside his dream , or had he just ended it ? He could n't remember ; but somewhere outside the chamber , an alarm began to sound . He picked up his staff in his right hand and got to his feet . Outside the chamber , the alarm bell continued its steady , pulse-note chime . He found the door and opened it , and stepped throughnot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but into the Old Hall at Demaizen , and the warm golden light of an autumn afternoon . Garrod syn-Aigal sus-Demaizengreat Magelord , Void- walker , and finder of worldshad taken the land and fortune that were his inheritance , and had used them to build a Circle strong enough and dedicated enough to carry out the greatest of great workings : to bring together the two parts of the sundered galaxy , crossing the interstellar gap and healing a rift that had existed since the unimaginably long ago . Arekhon had left the sus-Peledaen fleet and his family altars to become a part of Lord Garrod'sCircle , and when the working demanded it of him he had left his native world as well . He had walked through the Old Hall in dreams often enough since then , in the years after the Demaizen Mage-Circle had split apart in fire and blood , but never as now , with the weight of knowledge bearing down hard upon him . In these rooms , he had grown from a sus-Peledaen fleet-apprentice with a knack for seeing the eiran and making luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he came back to them with the sound of the Daughter 's alarm bell following him wherever he went . Sometimes in his dreams he saw the Mages of Demaizen as he had known them before . On those nights he sparred with Delath or Serazao in the long gallery , or talked of space and stars with Kiefen Diasul , though in the waking world both Del and ' Zao were dead , and Kief had betrayed all of them years ago . Tonight , though , was different . Instead of Delath or Serazao , the dream gave him Iulan Vai . Vaithe last-come member of the Circle , who had brought **26;239;TOOLONG from her employers , the sus-Radal , to save the Demaizen Mages from utter destruction , and who had stayed behind on Eraasi in order to repay the debt . Arekhon found her in the long gallery , with its tall , westward-facing windows and its racks of exercise mats and limber practice staves . She had n't altered her appearance since the last time he saw her in the flesh . Under the touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rusty- brown highlights , and she still clothed her compact frame in tunic and leggings of ordinary black . " Iule , " he saidthough she had always refused the forms of affection , even with those who might have had a claim to use them . " What are you doing here ? " " Looking for you . Did you think you could go away forever ? " " I did n't think I had a choice . " " You did n't , " she told him . " Not then . But everything changes , and we have to change with it . " As she spoke , the light from the westering sun struck the windowpanes at a new and sudden angle , dazzling his eyes for a moment . When the glare died , he was n't seeing Iulan Vai any longer . Another woman looked at him in her place : an older woman , whose thick black hair was shot through with wide streaks of iron-grey , and whose skin was the color of burnished copper . Not Vai , though like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , and not anyone else he recognized . " Do I know you ? " he asked her . " Not yet , " she said . " But soon . " Outside the long gallery , somewhere in the roomsand the lifethat he had left behind him , the sound of the Daughter 's alarm changed from a bell-note to a strident metallic wail . " You have to leave now . It 's almost time . " * * * Natelth sus-Khalgath sus-Peledaen stood with his back to the observation deck of his orbiting shipyard and stronghold , his face only a few inches from the armored glass that gave the deck its name . The world of Eraasi lay before him , a great globe against the starfield , black in the vacuum of space , stars glittering all around it . The sunset line lay across the world , on the left as he looked at it , the darkened crescent alive with city lights . He knew that elsewhere , hidden beyond the bulk of the planet , the citadel of the sus-Radal fleet-family circled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Natelth , secure in his own place , hardly thought of the sus- Radal . He led , and the other star-lords followed ; and if he started hopping on one foot , before long Theledau sus-Radal would be bouncing around on his head . Natelth heard the swish-click of the doubled inner airlocks that isolated the observation deck from the rest of the station , but he did n't turn . He would have known who was approaching him even if the armored glass had not shown him her reflected image . His sister Isayana , joining him in the safety of exile from the planet 's surface , had come bearing news . He hated living on the orbiting station . He watched Isayana 's reflection approaching , not a twin of his own , but close enough that he and she had often been mistaken for such when both were young : the same square frame and strong features , the same black hair now going grey . Isayana 's light-colored garments appeared stark against the black of space , under the dim illumination of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . The observation deck held no chairs , no furniture , no decoration . When Hanilat and the station slid under Eraasi 's nightside , then he could dial up the lights . He could . So far , he never had . " What 's happening ? " Natelth asked his sister , after she had walked , ghost-silent , to his side . " Not much , " she said . " The launch of Fair-Wind-Rising will be on time . " She fell silent , looking down at the world where they had both been born , and where they could never live at ease again . Star-lords they were , as their family had always been , but never so much as now . " We 'll need to spend some time in Hanilat before the end of the year , " he said . " Working out of the family house . " " The security people will hate that , " Isayana said . " I know . " Another long silence . " Have you heard any word from any of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About some kind of cooperative arrangement for dealing with problems down on the planet ? " Natelth 's face hardened . " There 's no cooperation between star-lords . " " We 're living in changing times , Na'e . What was true a generation ago is n't going to be true forever . " Natelth turned to look at his sister . The empty observation platform stretched out to his right , the light from Eraasi bringing up the profile of his face , his right side in shadow . " And how do you propose to bring about this new era of cooperation ? " " We need to make alliances , " she said . " Alliances based on trust , not fear . " " With the likes of Theledau sus-Radal ? " " Thel is n't a rival , " she said . " He has n't been building warships for almost five years now ; maybe he 's waiting for you to notice that he 's not a threat . " " He 's still there , " Natelth said . He turned back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globe below them . The orbital shipyard was in geosynchronous orbit , the starport city of Hanilat lying forever directly below them . Whatever the space station lacked in comforts for the souland Natelth thought that it lacked most of themat least here he could see strangers approaching from a long way off . " Down in Hanilat , waiting for me to make a mistake . And if he is n't building warships , it 's probably because he 's working on something else . I would be . " " We have larger enemies than the other fleet-families , Na'e , " Isayana said . She had n't stopped looking out , her feet square to the flat expanse of armor glass . A late-season storm washed over the southern ocean , but Hanilat , approaching its own sunset , had a cloudless sky . This station would be visible soon to those who lived and worked below . " We both know it . The other families know it too . You , me , the sus-Radal , everyone . " She turned to face him , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What will the people of Eraasi do , when the people of Garrod 's world come back across the gap to deal with us ? " " Garrod was a meddling fool , " Natelth said . " And I was foolish enough to help him . " " All done before we knew , and beyond recall . " Her hand continued to rest on his shoulder . " Will you come and inspect Fair-Wind-Rising with me ? " " I suppose I should , " Natelth said , and turned his back on the glittering world outside the armored glass windows . * * * Arekhon awoke into darkness . The hour was well past moonset , so that the starlit rectangle of his bedroom window took a long minute to resolve into a patch of grey against the black . The furniturebed , nightstand , chair , desktook a little longer to emerge from the undifferentiated night . When he could distinguish the outline of the half-open closet door , over on the far side of the room , he got out of bed and began to dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid them out before retiring : garments of local cut , but made in the plain black and white he had always preferred . He 'd never grown accustomed to the colors of this world , its alien dyestuffs and yet more alien aesthetics , and after a while he had given up trying . He put on shirt and trousers and a loose jacket , then hesitated a moment before pulling on his boots . Stocking feet would have been quieter , but far less dignified . Arekhon had nothing against suffering embarrassment in a good cause , but he had no desire to suffer it unnecessarily . He picked up his staff and fastened it to his belt , then stood for a moment , thoughtful , before opening the drawer of the night table and pulling out a hand-sized object shaped like a flattened cylinder . He slid the pulse-gun into the inner pocket of his jacket , then shut the drawer and left the room . The lower floors of the building were silent and empty . In the town houses of Arekhon 's childhood , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligences in their metal shells ; it had been impossible for anyone to move about in secret without first subverting the quasi-organic servitors . They did n't have aiketen here on this side of the interstellar gap . The men and women who did what should have been a construct 's laborand who worked late and rose early slept in a warren of small rooms high up under the mansion 's gabled roof . No one lived on the bottom floor except for Arekhon . He was , at least nominally , a scholar-savant under Mestra Elela Rosselin 's patronage , and entitled to maintain private chambers elsewhere at her expense . But those closest to the Mestra knew himby face if not by nameas the man responsible for House Rosselin 's domestic security , and they would expect to find such a one keeping his quarters under the Mestra 's roof . Arekhon , who had known the Mestra when she was still Elaeli Inadi syn-Peledaen , considered himself fortunate in the arrangement . The stairs ascending from the mansion 's lower level were dark and narrow . Arekhon went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the next set of stairs as well . These were wider , and lit by a night-glow in a niche halfway along . The door at the top answered to a palmprint scan ; Arekhon was one of the people it recognized . He placed his right hand against the pad and the lock clicked open . He passed through one darkened room , noting the dim shapes of chairs and cabinets and pieces of unobjectionable art , all unchanged since his last visit , and through another , this one a private office similarly unaltered , before he came to another door with a palmprint scan . Again he touched the pad , and , when the lock answered , opened the door . Elaeli was awake , though it took him a moment to spot her in the unlighted room . She wore a loose bedrobe of dark fabric , andstanding as she did a little to one side of the windowseemed at first like a part of the curtain that had been drawn aside . She looked around as he entered . " ' Rekhe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go looking for you . I could n't sleep . " He crossed over to where she stood , and put an arm around her , so that she could lean her head against his shoulder . She was as tall as he was , and her light brown curls were soft against his cheek . She still wore her hair short , after the style of the sus-Peledaen fleetit was almost the only part of her past she 'd been able to hang on to , he supposed . Arekhon had let his own black hair grow out long when he left the fleet for the Demaizen Circle , and he had n't cut it since , but Elaeli had more reason that he did to cherish the older style . She 'd been a bright young light in the sus-Peledaen fleet Pilot-Principal on the first exploratory voyage to make contact beyond the Edgeuntil Lord Garrod and the Demaizen Circle had conscripted her into the service of the great working . Arekhon was never sure whether her political maneuverings here on Entibor sprang from honest ambition in search of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hurt too much to remember . " I 'm here now , " he said . " I miss you when you 're away downstairs . " " This is the city , " he said . " If I stay in your rooms for the whole night , the servants will officially know , and if the servants know , the scandal-rags will have it by nightfall . " " Damn the scandal-rags . " She sounded tired , worn down with waiting for sleep that had n't come . " Fourteen years I 've been here , ' Rekhe , and I still do n't understand this place . " " Do n't try . Just ride the luck , and trust it to carry you in the right direction . " Which it would do , Arekhon reflected ; he had expended considerable energy over the years in working the eiran for this world , and for Elaeli Inadi syn-Peledaen . The threads of his own luck were tangled and untended by comparison . He would probably come to regret that one of these days , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Provost of Elicond does n't believe in luck ; he believes in biolabs . " " I know . " Nothing could make Arekhon like the idea of the Provost 's visitElaeli needed the Provost 's support in the complicated political maneuverings of the Federated Quarter , and the Provost had asked for a gene-link with House Rosselin in returnbut at least this alliance would be a matter for physicians and technicians , and not for more traditional methods . " It 's only for three weeks . " " I hope that 's long enough to suit him , " Elaeli said . " Because three weeks is about all I can handle thinking about . " " Tell him all the security arrangements are for three weeks , and that it 's too late to change them . Put the blame on me if you have to . " " That 's hardly fair . " He did n't bother telling Elaeli that nothing about their life together was fair ; she knew that as well as he did already . Instead , he told her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Venner " his second , a clever and ambitious young man from the rough side of An-Jemayne " has already been briefed on everything , and you can trust him to handle whatever comes up . " " If you trained him , ' Rekhe , I 'm sure he 's good . " She leaned against him for a moment in silence , looking out at the dark , and then said , " As soon as the Provost is taken care of , I 'm going to the country and staying there for a while .... will you stay there with me ? " " Yes , " said Arekhon . Elaeli 's summer cottage was isolated enough that the scandal-rags did n't bother with itat least not for something as commonplace as bedroom gossip . Arekhon thought of the pleasure of waking beside Elaeli in the morning sunlight , and sighed . You have to leave now , the woman in his dream had told him . It 's almost time . He did not think that she had been speaking of the house in An-Jemayne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farspace Entibor : Rosselin Cottage Herin Arayet sus-Dariv took his rented groundcar around the last curve on the uphill drive to Demaizen Old Hall . The burnt-out shell of the ruined building reared up against the sky ahead of him . A little later , he saw a line of rusting metal hulks drawn up in good order on the overgrown gravel driveway , with clingvine spreading over them and tall stalks of field weeds springing up around their treads . He slowed the groundcar into a careful approach . He 'd taken his usual precautions before setting out on today 's erranda pocket-pistol concealed inside his jacket , a knife hidden up his sleeve , a note to the family 's Agent-Principal filed among his personal effectsbut he knew that against Magecraft , such measures would do him little good . And whatever had happened to the line of blasted and shattered assault vehicles had been a Mage 's work . Nobody knew , or at least nobody admitted in public to knowing , exactly who had sent the private assault team up against Garrod syn-Aigal and his Circle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrest that had disturbed Eraasi 's main continent over ten years before ; but Demaizen had been an independent Circle during that period , supported by Garrod 's private fortune and not tied formally to any particular faction or institution . True , they 'd had an informal connection to the sus-Peledaen fleet-familyLord Natelth 's younger brother had been one of the Demaizen Mages , and members of the Circle had taken part in the sus-Peledaen exploratory voyage to the far side of the interstellar gapbut such a connection should have given Demaizen more protection , rather than less . The one thing Herin could say for certain about the attack was that neither side had survived the encounter , and that no guilty parties had revealed themselves by coming in to clean things up afterward . The house and grounds had passed into the hands of the Wide Hills District Wildlife Protection League , according to Lord Garrod 's testamentary wishes ; and the League so far had operated strictly within the boundaries of its charter , leaving the ruined Hall untouched . Herin was n't surprised . What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted the Old Hall left alone , and alone it stayed , unaltered except by the elements . No graffiti marked its smoke-stained walls , and no empty cans or broken bottles littered the shadowed ground beneath . Even the local adolescents , it seemed , chose to go elsewhere for their amateur debaucheries . He left his groundcar parked in the driveway and made his way up the front steps of the Hall and through the great , broken doors . Inside was more destruction , cracked brick and burnt wood and more than once a disturbing glimpse of something that looked like bone . He found the door that his contact had told him about , a small one that opened onto a service stairway , and started down the narrow steps into the basement . " Syr Arayet . " The voice came from the darkness ahead of him . It was low and not unpleasanta woman 's voice , he thought . A moment later , a light came on in the corridor . After a few seconds , he realized that the pale , apparently sourceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's right hand . He could n't see her face , and it took him another few seconds to realize that the blank , reflective darkness underneath the hood of her black cloak was in fact a spacer 's ship-combat hardmask . " Etaze , " he said , using the term of respect for a Magelord of high rank . Maybe this one was merely somebody 's Circle-Mage , disaffected enough to send along a request for a personal meeting . But if she was notif she was the First or even the Second of a major Circle , whether in Hanilat or in one of the fleetsthen she would need polite and careful handling . " Your message reached me only a short while ago . I came as soon as I dared . " The woman chuckled , a surprisingly warm sound to come from behind the dark plastic of a combat hardmask . " You mean you came as soon as you 'd made sure that my message was genuine . Nobody 's ever called you a fool , Syr Arayet . " " I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What is it you wanted to talk with me about ? " " I heard that you were interested in what became of the Demaizen Circle . " Herin nodded . " I 've only heard the rumors , and I 'm curious . " " That all happened a long time ago . Why start asking questions about it now ? " " Call it a hobby , " he said . " The past informs the present , and so forth . " There was a long pause . Herin could feel the woman 's gaze assessing him from behind the unrevealing hardmask . " A present , " she said finally , " in which the sus-Dariv are debating whether or not to deploy private ground security forces as an auxiliary to their fleet arm . " He said nothing , though he was uncomfortably aware that the damp , cobwebby basement of Demaizen Old Hall was the sort of place in which a too-curious researcher could conveniently disappear . Lord Garrod 's Circle had died there , as far as anyone could tell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another body moldering away in the dark would probably never be noticed . " Do n't worry , " she said , as if his hidden trepidation had somehow manifested itself around him like an aura . For all Herin knew , it could have . Mages saw things like that , where other people saw nothing but plain air . " I still have some standards . If I 'd wanted to do you harm , I would n't have come up with anything half as melodramatic as this . " " I 'm relieved to hear it , etaze . " " I 'm sure you are , " she said . " Now for the reason you came here : Ask me your questions , and I 'll answer them . At least , as much as I can and may . " " Very well , " said Herin . " What happened to Lord Garrod 's Circle ? " " Who sent the killers , do you mean ? " " Well , yes . " She shrugged . " The first time ? No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know .... what do you mean , ' the first time ' ? There was a second attack ? " " When the rest of the Circle came back from across the Gap Between . But the Hall had already burned down by then . " Herin felt a brief flicker of intellectual vindication . Investigating the destruction of the Old Hall had been a personal project . If he 'd made it official , he would have had some trouble justifying his interest in a bit of recent history that the family 's less irregular agents had chosen to overlook . Already , though , he had retrieved an interesting bit of previously uncollected knowledgetwo bits , if he counted the implication that the identity of the second group of attackers , unlike that of the first , was not unknown . " You must have a theory about why the initial attack failed , " he said . " You think that this " she used the hand that held the glowing staff to describe a vague circle , presumably meant to include the entirety of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack had been a complete success , somebody would have taken credit for it . Nobody ever did . " Herin paused . He 'd never intended to keep up his current pose as a hobby-researcher for very longit was a means of gaining entry , and little morebut he shied away from revealing his true interests quite so bluntly . " I think that whoever sent in the strike team was afraid . Those assault vehicles up there were blasted by Magecraft . They had to have been ; there 's no record anywhere of the Demaizen Circle having weapons . If one of Lord Garrod 's Mages survived long enough to do something like that " " then he or she might still be alive , " said the woman . " And still angry . " " Yes . " " A good theory . " " I like to think so , " said Herin . " What I do n't know is who he was . " " Or she , " said the woman . She gave a quiet laugh . " If it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't me . " " Can you tell me who ? " " Delath syn-Arvedan died in the first attack , " she said . " So did Lord Garrod and Serazao Zuleimem . " He knew the names of the Demaizen Circle , both the ones who had stayed behind on Eraasi and the ones who had gone exploring with the sus-Peledaen across the interstellar gap ; he 'd made it his business to find out when he began his researches . And he could do subtraction in his head as well as any man . " Diasul , " he said . " Kiefen Diasul. " * * * Iulan Vai stayed behind in the shadows and watched the sus-Dariv agent make his way out of the ruins and back down to the overgrown drive . He 'd come to her for this meeting , not the other way around , and she was n't sure what that meant . She 'd heard rumors that someone was asking questions about the Old Hall , and about Lord Garrod 's Circlemaybe she was n't the sus-Radal 's Agent-Principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her old contacts in the shadow world of information gatheringand she had taken steps to make certain that the questioner made contact with her . Herin Arayet sus-Dariv had not been what she was expecting . To begin with , he was n't a hireling . He was a family member from one of the inner lines , and probably well- off enough in his own right that he did n't need to work at all if he lacked the inclination to do so . She wondered what had induced him to take up his peculiar hobby . Was he moved by concern for the family good , or by the pleasure of finding out secret thingsor had somebody high up in the inner family trained him for the work ? He was suited for it , Vai conceded , at least inasmuch as nobody would take him at first glance for one of the sus-Dariv . That family ran to slightly-built blondes and redheads , especially in the inner lines , and Syr Arayet was dark and wiry and at least a head taller than the average . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrew from the ruins of the Old Hall and made her way back to Demaizen Town . She kept a rented room there , upstairs from an all-night staples-and-sundries shop . The name on the lease was n't hers , of course , except in the sense that she 'd created the identity and used it off and on for over a decade . She 'd wanted to have a bolt-hole available somewhere outside of Hanilat , and it had made sense , or so she told herself , to set one up where she could keep an eye on the Old Hall as well . The manager of the sundries shop collected the rent and watched over the place for her when she was absent . The cloak and hardmask Vai had worn at the Old Hall were out of sight in her daypack by the time she reached town . The staff was n't as easily concealed , so she did n't bother . As far as the townspeople were concerned , her local persona claimed affiliation with a minor Circle someplace in Hanilat , the kind of Circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fellowship and the occasional minor working . She stopped in the sundries shop to buy a pack of candles and exchange greetings with the night clerk , then went on upstairs to her room . She 'd told the store manager that she was a field investigator for the Wildlife Protection League , using the small apartment as a place to rest and write up reports in between assignments , and she 'd fixed up the room with that identity in mind : locally purchased secondhand furniture mixed in with a scattering of folk-art pieces from the Antipodes and the northern territories ; bedspread and curtains made of hand-spun fibers block-printed in traditional patterns ; maps and journals and data-readers covering all the available flat surfaces . She 'd thought for a while of painting a proper meditation circle in white and black on the wooden floornothing in the terms of her lease said that she could n't , and people would be unwilling to gainsay a Mage in any casebut in the end she had decided not to . The landlord would have to refinish the surface if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him extra work . A chalk outline scrawled on the floor served well enough for her purposes , and scrubbed away easily afterward . Vai shucked off her daypack and tucked it out of the way beneath her local persona 's cluttered desk . A pottery bowl at one end of the desktop held the stub end of a stick of chalk , along with a flick-top lighter , a spool of black thread , and half a dozen small , weathered stones . She stood for a moment undecided , then picked up the chalk and used it to inscribe a circle on the polished wooden floorboards . Nobody would be surprised if the Mage upstairs chose to meditate upon a private intention . They would assume that she held the shop and its environs in her thoughts as well , and would be , if anything , grateful . The cabinet in the kitchen nook held a quartet of cheap glass candleholders . She fetched them down and set them out around the perimeter of the chalk circle , then unwrapped the candles she 'd bought in the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the candles went into the cabinet . Then she took the flick-lighter from the pottery bowl and used it to light each of the candles in turn . A quick tap on the desk 's control pad , and the lamp that had come on when she entered the apartment clicked off again , leaving the room lit only by the yellow , unstable candleflames . Vai stepped into the circle she had drawn , and knelt . As always when she did this , she felt keenly the absence of the rest of Demaizen 's Mages , the dead and the estranged and the unimaginably far away . She needed them here with her , needed their greater strength and their longer training as she opened herself to the vision of the eiran . The silver cords of life and luck came to her sight hesitantly at first , in wisps and tendrils . She let herself watch them , and tried not to think about them overmuch . If she focused her attention on them too soon , they would fade , and all her careful non-effort would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbidden out of her thoughts , not as a distraction but as something to be dealt with , a part of the unsettled state of mind that had led her to this meditation in the first place . She considered the name , and marked how the words insinuated themselves into the weave of the eiran as she watched . The silver threads caught hold of the name , and ran in and out of it like vines on a wrought-iron fence . Vai smiled at their eagerness . The eiran knew Syr Arayet , whether Syr Arayet knew them or not . She considered the matter a little longer , then pulled on the cords enough to twist and lodge them yet more firmly into the man 's name and his place in the patternworking the luck , just a little , for a man who was , in some sense , a colleague in a dangerous profession . And if more should ever come of it than that , well , the universe had a strange sense of humor sometimes , and she herself had first come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she let her thoughts move outward from the troubles of the present , following the eiran as they traced their patterns through time and space . Arekhon sus-Khalgath had seen the pattern of the great working , the binding- together of the sundered galaxy , both as it stood now and as it would come to completionbut ' Rekhe was on the far side of the galaxy and not likely to be coming home soon no matter how much she wished for him . She needed him , though ; the working needed him . The Circles were changing , moving away from what they had been .... we served all of the people once , she thought , it was that way even when I was a child . Now the fleet-families and the merchant-combines want to make us tend the luck for them alone and not for the whole world , and I do n't know enough about the old ways to set things right . I do n't even know if it 's possible to set things right . Some things , when they change , ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her hand and mind had brighter and darker threads in it . She tugged at one of the dimmer lines , hoping to tease it out of the mass and straighten up at least a fraction of the disarray . When she pulled on the thread , it grew brighter in response . Under the surface of her meditation , curiosity stirred and came to life . This was a new thread , stretching away out of the local tangle and leading off into strange and uncharted realms . Something different was coming into the workingsomething fresh and unanticipated , yet at the same time very old and very strong . Something dangerous . * * * The sun was rising over the hills beyond Rosselin Cottage , and a light mist hovered between the branches of the spring-green trees . Arekhon had risen early , after his custom when he was here alone . He sat in a wicker chair on the screened-in verandah , sipping at a mug of the hot bitter liquid the people on this world drank for a morning stimulant . Elaeli 's summer cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosselin 's first home on Entiborpart of the fictitious identity that Garrod syn-Aigal had made ready for her , knowing that the great working would bring her to it in time . Remote , isolated , and rustic , the cottage had provided a safe haven from which to launch a political career , and Elaeli had used it to play politics with a will . " I was planning to be Fleet-Admiral for the sus-Peledaen , " she 'd said to him , " back before Lord Garrod conscripted me into the great working and then marooned me on Entibor with a bankroll and a fake identity . I could n't leave all that ambition behind just because I was n't with the fleet anymore ; I had to do something , or I 'd go crazy . And when I came here , politics was what there was to do . " The cottage itself was a rustic , sprawling building , built of wood and painted white , that floated like a low cloud on the brow of the mountain , against the forest 's edge . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted . Elaeli was in the city , entertaining and being entertained by the Provost of Elicond ; and it was better for everybody 's peace of mind if her chief of domestic securitywho was not , officially , her loverstayed away until the Provost had finished his business and gone home . As a domestic arrangement it was less than ideal , but far better than nothing at all . They 'd had a little over ten years of it , by local reckoning . Arekhon tried to do the arithmetic for converting the passage of time into Eraasian measures , and gave up when he could n't remember the exact ratio of one planetary year to the other . At the moment , though , he was content . This world was fair , and this country house was fair , and here , when her business with the Provost was done , Elaeli would be joining him . For a little while , at least , they could pretend that nothing would ever changethough the time he 'd had here with Elaeli would never be long enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far too long . But both times are the same , he thought . Like the Void , where all times are the same time ..... " . . . and all places are the same place . " The words were Eraasian , but marked by a strong accent , as though the speaker had learned the language as an adult . Turning , Arekhon recognized the strange woman who had come to him in his dream of Demaizen Old Hall , displacing Iulan Vai and telling him that he would know her soon . One of the wooden floorboards creaked faintly as she stepped forward out of what might have been a shadow left over from the night . So she was real , then , and a Void-walker as well , one of the powerful Mages who could journey alone and unprotected through the no-time , no-place that lay beneath the physical universe . Garrod syn-Aigal had also been a Void- walker , earning the nickname " Explorer " because of the worlds he had journeyed to in that fashion , marking a way through the Void @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arekhon was less startled by the manner of his visitor 's arrival than by the fact that she had spoken to him earlier in his dream . Seen in the unexpected flesh , she was n't tallperhaps half a head less than Arekhon 's own moderate height , even in the sturdy boots that she wore with her white shirt and black trousersbut compact and trim with muscle . The staff she carried in her right hand was a cubit and a half of ebony , bound and ornamented with silver wire . " Who are you ? " he asked . " My name is Llannat Hyfid , " she said . " I 'm your last student . " " Llann " He stumbled a bit over the unfamiliar syllables . The words were n't Eraasian , or any other language that he was aware of . That meant nothing , given that a Void- walker could be from anywhere , or any when . If such a one had deliberately sought him out , first in dreams and then in the flesh .... he tried the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If the name gives you trouble , " she said , " you can call me Maraganha instead . Some people find it easier on the tongue . " " Maraganha . " The name meant " from the forested place " in Eraasian , which told him something , at least , about his mysterious visitorand as she had promised , its syllables were easier for him to say . But the woman herself remained an enigma . " I do n't know you . And I 've never had a student . " " You wereyou will bequite a bit older then . " Arekhon shivered , even though the morning was warm . He remembered how it had felt to look upon Garrod syn-Aigal sus- Demaizen as a great Magelord in the vigorous prime of his life , and know that the same man would in time become the white-haired idiot the Circle had already left behind on Erassi . The thought of Maraganha or anyone else looking at him in the same manner was profoundly disturbing . " I said something like that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When Garrod came back through the Void to show the rest of us the way to Entibor . But there are n't any Mages on this world , Maraganha . Only Adepts , and they 're a cold and solitary lot . " " It 's their way . " Maraganha came forward and took a seat in the other chair , the one that was usually Elaeli 's , and laid her ebony staff across her knees . " I was one of them , until it did n't suit me any longer . My fault as much as theirs ; I 've known Mages who would do well in an Adepts ' Guildhouse " " I 've seen it happen , " Arekhon said . " It 's not for me . " " Here you are , though , as lonely as any Adept in the galaxy . " " None of it was my idea . I had a Circle once , but it 's broken and scattered across the interstellar gap . " " Scattered , maybe , " she said . " But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know that . How can you ? " " My first teacher was called the Breaker of Circles . Believe me , I know all about these things . " He sat for a moment in silence , not looking at her , gazing out into the flower-scented dawning . Then he said , " I 'm not sure I like my future very much , if it has people in it with names like that . " " It 's all part of the great working . Did you think that putting the galaxy back together was going to be a quick and easy job ? " " If I ever thought so , " he answered , " it did n't take me long to learn otherwise . And if that 's what you 're here for , you 've come a long way to tell me something I already know . " " Well , I did n't come here for the sake of sitting on your front porch and admiring the view , " she said , rather more sharply than before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at . " " Why , then ? " " I dreamed about you last night for the first time inlet 's just say , for the first time in a long whileand when I woke up I had a feeling you were going to need my help . So I walked the Void until I found where you were waiting . " " That 's certainly clear , " he said . " Did you happen to see what kind of help I was going to need ? " Maraganha shrugged . " It 's as clear as I can make it . And I 'm afraid the universe did n't bother to give me specific instructions . " " I do n't think anything scares you , etaze . " He gave her the title without thinking , and was n't surprised when she accepted it as her right . If Maraganha was a Void-walker , then she 'd have to be the First of her Circle as well . For all her superficial friendliness and ease of manner , Arekhon knew that he was looking at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " You 'd be surprised , " she said . " When I was young , I was scared to death of everything , and scared of myself most of all . That 's the biggest part of what you taught me , in fact to trust in what I knew and what I was . " " I 'm glad that I was able to help . Or will be able to , as the case may be . " He shook his head . " If we 're going to keep on talking like this , we need better verbs . " " I ca n't help you with the verbs , " she said . Then she looked at him straight on , and her voice had the same firmness and surety it had held in his dream . " But whatever else it is you 're planning to doI can help you with that . " " My Circle , " he said . There was no chance , not after all this , that his dreams of late had been mere homesickness , born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be something other than what necessity had given them . This was the great working , that he had pledged himself to finish when he was still the Third of Garrod 's Circle , and there was no escape from it . " I need to find the rest of my Circle on Entibor , and take them home . " * * * It was the damned ship-mind again . Lenyat Iraoknown to his cousins and most of his workaday associates as Lenwatched in disgust as the display on the chart table flickered . Fire-on-the-Hilltops was an old ship , a one-man light cargo carrier purchased secondhand from the sus-Radal after that fleet-family had upgraded all of their own vessels to the new style . Len had known she was obsolete on the day he bought her , but that was how the game was played . New construction was for the star-lords , and everybody else took what was left over . Still , he 'd expected the Fire to hold together long enough for him to finish paying for her . And it was starting to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to happen . Lately she 'd been growing reluctant to interface with anybody 's charts but her own , and if that kept up , there went any hope of getting another decent contract . The display blinked on and off and on again one more time , then settled down . The false-color display took on a three-dimensional aspect , the orbital lanes in blue , the world in yellow , and the marker-buoy in white . " Finally , " Len said . " Took you long enough . " As usual , he addressed his ship not in the Hanilat-Eraasian that he 'd learned in school , but in his milk tongue , the language of Eraasi 's antipodean subcontinent . The Irao had never intermarried with outsiders , and Len 's knife-blade nose and yellowish-hazel eyes would have passed without remark in the homeland that his family had left a hundred years ago . With the chart finally stabilized , he went to work setting up the Fire for emergence from the Void . The marker he 'd asked for was a deep one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lanes . He 'd have a long crawl past the outer planets , doing it that way , but he was n't hauling perishable cargo and safety was better than speed . For a good enough contract , sure , he 'd pop out of the Void close in over Eraasi , and risk having one of the big fleet-families take him for an unlawful intruder and respond with force . He 'd gotten his latest contract through the sus-Dariv , and Fire-on-the-Hilltops was listed with their fleet for the duration of the current voyage , but that would n't help much if a trigger-happy guardship captain decided not to bother with asking for his papers . All the Fire had aboard this time was mixed-lot bulk cargo : transport , not trade , most of it , and not big enough to warrant a fleet-family 's direct attention . Independents like Len handled the small jobs , and the urgent ones that could n't wait for a convoy or a fleet courier , but the star-lords would come down hard on any pilot they suspected of working without a contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it . " Hard times , old girl , " Len said to the Fire , as the ship-mind chewed its laborious way through the calculations for normal-space emergence . " Hard times . You and I , we were born too late . " There had been a time , not more than a generation or so ago , when a family working in the grey could gather enough ships ( by trade or purchase or outright capture ) to put a syn- or even a sus- in front of their name and have it stick . Len had daydreamed of it himself in his boyhood , back when he was the space-happy one among all the cousins . He 'd pictured himself taking the family out of the groundside shipping and transportation business and into the stars , making them syn- Irao and star-lords and a fleet-family in Hanilat . Then he grew up , of course , and understood that those days were gone . He took the figures the ship-mind ground out for him and entered the series of commands that would pass them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and keyed in the final sequence . There was only the ship-mind to hear him , but he 'd learned to observe the formalities during his training days , when he 'd served as hired crew aboard fleet-family ships . A little while later he felt the disquieting inner sensation of Void-emergence pass through him like an oily wave . The distinctive hum and vibration of the Fire 's passage changed in response . Even if he 'd somehow managed to sleep through the emergence , he would have known , by the sound and by the feel of the ship around him , that Fire-on-the-Hilltops was moving through normal space . It was eight hours before he heard the distress signal . He had the Fire 's search-and-scan routines set to a tripwire sensitivity these daysa lowly contract-captain could n't be too careful . They repaid him this time with a clamoring alarm and , when he put the signal onto ship 's audio , a voice : " This is sus-Dariv 's Garden-of-Fair-Blossoms , " it said , and the synthesized clarity of its pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of Len 's neck . The only thing in space with a voice like that was a ship-mind , and if the ship-mind alone remained able to put out a signal , something very bad had happened aboard Garden-of-Fair-Blossoms . " If you are receiving this transmission , know that we are in distress and call for aid . We beg of you , make all speed to our location at " there followed a warbling noise that Len recognized as the Garden 's ship-mind transmitting its reference coordinates directly to the ship-mind of whatever vessel might be listening . Then there was a pause , and the message started all over again . Len hit the Transmit button on the Fire 's communications board . " Garden-of-Fair-Blossoms , " he said . " This is contract carrier Fire-on-the-Hilltops . Try to hold onI 'm coming as fast as I can . " He turned back to the navigation console . For once , the Fire 's ship-mind had behaved itself properly . The false-color display now included a flashing amber dotthe Garden 's reference coordinates . He contemplated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapped in his course-query . More numbers and letters came up in reply , and the false-color display shifted , then shifted again after a second query and a second response . After the third query , he said aloud , " I think you 've got it this time , old girl . " The Fire 's ship-mind did n't have an internal speaker . Instead , the alphanumeric display at the navigational console reset itself to zero , then said , THIS COURSE CONTRADICTS PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED PREFERENCE FOR NORMAL SPACE RUNNING DURING ERASSI APPROACH . " That was then , " he said . " And this is now . I 'm not going to drag my feet through normal space on my way to answer a distress call , and neither are you . "
