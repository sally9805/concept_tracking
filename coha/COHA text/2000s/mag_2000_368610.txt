Competition has been a dirty word for decades in Italy , particularly for entrenched state monopolies like Alitalia and the electric company ENEL . But the private sector has n't liked the word much either . If the country 's suddenly energized Antitrust Authority has its way , however , businesses may have to get used to it . Last July Italy 's insurance firms got a rude awakening when the Authority slapped them with $350 million in fines after determining they had fixed prices for many forms of vehicle insurance . <P> The Authority , established in 1991 , has gone on a tear over the past couple of years , thanks to a strong-willed new President and a public that is fed up with rigged markets and insider deals . The insurance crackdown was its biggest to date , but earlier in the summer , the Authority slapped $320 million in penalties on eight oil companies for conspiring to fix gasoline prices . Even earlier , it fined the country 's two main cellular-phone operators for setting identical prices for fixed-to-mobile calls . The Authority has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production ceilings for individual producers . <P> " In theory , at least , the consumer should be the one who benefits from competition , but in fact , the entire system benefits , " says Giuseppe Tesauro , president of the Authority and the man behind its newfound rigor . " Competition is democracy in economic relations . The very companies that do things to block competition end up hurting themselves . " <P> Tesauro , a law professor and former advocate general at the European Court of Justice , was named to his post in 1998 and quickly set about giving the Authority real teeth . It helps that the country 's current Prime Minister , Giuliano Amato , was Tesauro 's predecessor . In the past two years , the Authority has imposed more fines than in the previous eight years combined . Mario Libertini , who teaches industrial law at the University of Rome , says Amato brought tremendous prestige to the Authority , but he notes that the body took on greater force after it started to levy heavy fines . " In the early years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " In the beginning , there was normally just an injunction , as if everything were a venial sin . " <P> The Authority , with a staff of 170 , ca n't follow up on every complaint it receives , and Tesauro wields considerable power in choosing where the agency will focus its energy . He has decided to take on high- profile cases that offer a big payoff in public support . In July the Authority opened an investigation into the National Association of Pharmacy Owners for prohibiting individual pharmacies from offering discounts on products whose prices are not regulated . " The monopoly of the pharmacies , above all for items that are not medicine , is somewhat medieval , " Tesauro says . <P> Tesauro 's team has kept a keen eye on the sale of a wide variety of nonmedical products sold by pharmacies and taken action as well . Last March the Authority dissolved a cartel of six producers of powdered milk for babies , which for years had denied supermarkets the chance to sell their product and instead used pharmacies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the Authority , powdered- milk prices were two to three times higher in Italy than abroad . Supermarkets at last started selling the product this summer .
