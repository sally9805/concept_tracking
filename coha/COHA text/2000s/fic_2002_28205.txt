Chapter One like most juicy stories , it started at a party " I watched Nickelodeon all morning in my room so I would n't have to eat breakfast with them , " BlairWaldorf told her two best friends and Constance Billard School classmates , Kati Farkas and Isabel Coates . " My mother cooked him an omelet . I did n't even know she knew how to use the stove . " Blair tucked her long , dark brown hair behind her ears and swigged her mother 's fine vintage scotch from the crystal tumbler in her hand . She was already on her second glass . " What shows did you watch ? " Isabel asked , removing a stray strand of hair from Blair 's black cashmere cardigan . " Who cares ? " Blair said , stamping her foot . She was wearing her new black ballet flats . Very bow-tie proper preppy , which she could get away with because she could change her mind in an instant and put on her trashy , pointed , knee-high boots and that sexy metallic skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The point is , I was trapped in my room all morning because they were busy having a gross romantic breakfast in their matching red silk bathrobes . They did n't even take showers . " Blair took another gulp of her drink . The only way to tolerate the thought of hermother sleeping with that man was to get drunk-very drunk . Luckily Blair and her friends came from the kind of families for whom drinking was as commonplace as blowing your nose . Their parents believed in the quasi-European idea that the more access kids have to alcohol , the less likely they are to abuse it . So Blair and her friends could drink whatever they wanted , whenever they wanted , as long as they maintained their grades and their looks and did n't embarrass themselves or the family by puking in public , pissing their pants , or ranting in the streets . The same thing went for everything else , like sex or drugs-as long as you kept up appearances , you were all right . But keep your panties on . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about was Cyrus Rose , her mother 's new boyfriend . At that very moment Cyrus Rose was standing on the other side of the living room , greeting the dinner guests . He looked like someone who might help you pick out shoes at Saks-bald , except for a small , bushy mustache , his fat stomach barely hidden in a shiny blue double-breasted suit . He jingled the change in his pocket incessantly , and when he took his jacket off , there were big , nasty sweat marks on his underarms . He had a loud laugh and was very sweet to Blair 's mother . But he was n't Blair 's father . Last year Blair 's father ran off to France with another man . No kidding . They live in a chateau and run a vineyard together . Which is actually pretty cool if you think about it . Of course none of that was Cyrus Rose 's fault , but that did n't matter to Blair . As far as Blair was concerned , Cyrus Rose was a completely annoying , fat , loser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyrus Rose , because the dinner party her mother was giving was in his honor , and all the Waldorfs ' family friends were there to meet him : the Bass family and their sons Chuck and Donald ; Mr. Farkas and his daughter , Kati ; the well-known actor Arthur Coates , his wife Titi , and their daughters , Isabel , Regina , and Camilla ; Captain and Mrs. Archibald and their son Nate . The only ones still missing were Mr. and Mrs. van der Woodsen whose teenage daughter , Serena , and son , Erik , were both away at school . Blair 's mother was famous for her dinner parties , and this was her first since her infamous divorce . The Waldorf penthouse had been expensively redecorated that summer in deep reds and chocolate browns , and it was full of antiques and artwork that would have impressed anyone who knew anything about art . In the center of the dining room table was an enormous silver bowl full of white orchids , pussy willows , and chestnut tree branches-a modern ensemble from Takashimaya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay on every porcelain plate . In the kitchen , Myrtle the cook was singing Bob Marley songs to the souffle , and the sloppy Irish maid , Esther , had n't poured scotch down anyone 's dress yet , thank God . Blair was the one getting sloppy . And if Cyrus Rose did n't stop harassing Nate , her boyfriend , she was going to have to go over there and spill her scotch all over his tacky Italian loafers . " You and Blair have been going out a long time , am I right ? " Cyrus said , punching Nate in the arm . He was trying to get the kid to loosen up a little . All these Upper East Side kids were way too uptight . That 's what he thinks . Give them time . " You sleep with her yet ? " Cyrus asked . Nate turned redder than the upholstery on the eighteenth-century French chaise next to him . " Well , we 've known each other practically since we were born , " he stuttered . " But we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't want to ruin it by , you know , rushing , before we 're ready ? " Nate was just spitting back the line that Blair always gave him when he asked her if she was ready to do it or not . But he was talking to his girlfriend 's mother 's boyfriend . What was he supposed to say , " Dude , if I had my way we 'd be doing it right now " ? " Absolutely , " Cyrus Rose said . He clasped Nate 's shoulder with a fleshy hand . Around his wrist was one of those gold Cartier cuff bracelets that you screw on and never take off-very popular in the 1980s and not so popular now , unless you 've actually bought into that whole ' 80s revival thing . Hello ? " Let me give you some advice , " Cyrus told Nate , as if Nate had a choice . " Do n't listen to a word that girl says . Girls like surprises . They want you to keep things interesting . You know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember the last time he 'd surprised Blair . The only thing that came to mind was the time he 'd brought her an ice cream cone when he picked her up at her tennis lesson . That was over a month ago , and it was a pretty lame surprise by any standard . At this rate , he and Blair might never have sex . Nate was one of those boys you look at and while you 're looking at them , you know they 're thinking , that girl ca n't take her eyes off me because I 'm so hot . Although he did n't act at all conceited about it . He could n't help looking hot , he was just born that way . Poor guy . That night Nate was wearing the moss-green cashmere V-neck sweater Blair had given him last Easter , when her father had taken them skiing in Sun Valley for a week . Secretly , Blair had sewn a tiny gold heart pendant onto the inside of one of the sweater 's sleeves , so that Nate would always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of herself as a hopeless romantic in the style of old movie actresses like Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe . She was always coming up with plot devices for the movie she was starring in at the moment , the movie that was her life . " I love you , " Blair had told Nate breathily when she gave him the sweater . " Me too , " Nate had said back , although he was n't exactly sure if it was true or not . When he put the sweater on , it looked so good on him that Blair wanted to scream and rip all her clothes off . But it seemed unattractive to scream in the heat of the moment-more femme fatale than girl-who-gets-boy-so Blair kept quiet , trying to remain fragile and baby-birdlike in Nate 's arms . They kissed for a long time , their cheeks hot and cold at the same time from being out on the slopes all day . Nate twined his fingers in Blair 's hair and pulled her down on the hotel bed . Blair put her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until she realized where this was all heading , and that it was n't a movie after all , it was real . So , like a good girl , she sat up and made Nate stop . She 'd kept on making him stop right on up until today . Only two nights ago , Nate had come over after a party with a half-drunk flask of brandy in his pocket and had lain down on her bed and murmured , " I want you , Blair . " Once again , Blair had wanted to scream and jump on top of him , but she resisted . Nate fell asleep , snoring softly , and Blair lay down next to him and imagined that she and Nate were starring in a movie in which they were married and he had a drinking problem , but she would stand by him always and love him forever , even if he occasionally wet the bed . Blair was n't trying to be a tease , she just was n't ready . She and Nate had barely seen each other at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible boot camp of a tennis school in North Carolina , and Nate had gone sailing with his father off the coast of Maine . Blair wanted to make sure that after spending the whole summer apart they still loved each other as much as ever . She had wanted to wait to have sex until her seventeenth birthday next month . But now she was through with waiting . Nate was looking better than ever . The moss-green sweater had turned his eyes a dark , sparkling green , and his wavy brown hair was streaked with golden blond from his summer on the ocean . And , just like that , Blair knew she was ready . She took another sip of her scotch . Oh , yes . She was definitely ready .
