The Army 's oldest special ops unit jumps into the future of warfare . // &gt; Pressing toward the door of the C-130 transport after the short flight from Fort Benning 's Lawson Army Airfield , you catch a glimpse of the Chattahoochee River and the drop zone just beyond in Alabama . The knot in your stomach tightens when you see the jump light turn from red to green . In a heartbeat you are at the door , and ready to take the first step toward becoming a member of the legendary U.S. Army Airborne Rangers . " Your first combat jump itself is n't really all that different from peacetime , " says Command Sgt. Maj. Douglas Greenway , thinking back to the night he earned the gold combat star on his own jump wings . " Because of all the events that are going on there 's a lot of stress-thinking about the mission , your men , and so forth . But for the most part , you 're confident like these soldiers and noncommissioned officers NCOs . Because of the training and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it would be in a unit that does n't have the money and the resources that we get to do our training here in the Ranger regiment . Those are what separate us . The great attitude . The resources . And the money and time that we get to do our training . " To learn more about how Airborne Rangers train , POPULAR MECHANICS is spending a week with this highly elite combat organization . " We are the largest direct-action force in the special operations comunity , says Col. Ken Keen , 75th Ranger Regiment commanding officer . Part of the U.S. Army 's Special Operations Command , the 75th Regiment comprises three 600- to 700  --  man battalions of Rangers . The 1st Battalion , 75th Rangers is based at Hunter rmy Airfield , Ga . The 2nd Battalion , th Rangers is based at Fort Lewis , Wash . And , the 3rd Battalion , 75th Rangers , together with regimental headquarters , is based at Fort Benning , Ga . " Our force structure is very much along the lines of a light infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique aspects of Army Ranger operations . " Our primary missions exist in the realm of being able to conduct forcible-entry direct-action missions . In particular , our missions include conducting forcible-entry operations to seize an airfield for a variety of purposes and to conduct raids behind enemy lines-anywhere from a platoon-size raid , which we did in Desert Storm , up to a battalion size . I like to say that we 're a tactical force with a strategic impact . " The Price Of Admission You can not simply enlist in the Airborne Rangers . First you have to prove you have the makings of a competent soldier . It all begins with nine weeks of U.S. Army initial basic training , which all enlistees undergo . From there , it is on to five more weeks of advanced individual training , with the majority of Ranger candidates focused on developing infantry skills . If you are still up for the challenge , you then learn how to jump out of an airplane , with three weeks of Airborne training culminating with your first jump to earn basic jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get steep . All Ranger candidates must pass through the Regimental Training Detachment . Here , privates and corporals complete the Ranger Indoctrination Program ( RIP ) . NCOs and officers attend a similar Ranger Orientation Program ( ROP ) . " The cadre at the training detachment is here to assess individuals for potential service in the regiment , " says 1st Sgt. James Hardy , who had his first combat experience in Somalia in 1993 . The assessment focuses on tough physical and academic standards . Of the 34 soldiers in the RIP class that PM observed , there were 22 failures . Voluntary withdrawals normally account for another 15 to 20 percent attrition during the three-week indoctrination phase . Completion of RIP/ROP is the basic price of admission . It allows a soldier to join the 75th Ranger Regiment where he serves for six to 12 months before being sent to the Army 's 62-day Ranger School . It is only after completion of this exhausting leadership training experience that the soldier returns to the regiment with the coveted gold Ranger tab above his left shoulder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color of that beret recently became the center of a controversy , the outcome of which remains undecided as this issue of PM goes to press . For the past quarter century Airborne Rangers , and only Airborne Rangers , have had Department of the Army permission to wear the black beret . Last October , Gen. Eric Shinseki , Army chief of staff , decided that the black beret should be standard issue for the entire Army . He reasoned that the black beret is a symbol of quality that will spur all units toward Ranger standards of excellence , as the Army itself attempts to becomes more Ranger-like by transforming into a lighter , more rapidly deployable force ( " Army 's New Ride , " Feb. 2001 , page 52 ) . Veteran Airborne Rangers reacted swiftly and negatively . A compromise may have the entire Army in black berets , except for the Airborne Rangers , whose new berets may be tan . Crawl , Photograph Fast-roping ( left ) puts large numbers of Rangers into action quickly . Experiments are under way to make greater tactical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Run In response to the uncertain needs of special operations mission planners , the Army 's Ranger battalions cycle through three different readiness postures . A component training cycle focuses on reinforcing individual and small-unit tactical skills . The operational preparation phase ties those skills into the activities of larger units and joint forces . And , a " ready " phase ensures that a powerful combat-capable force can be called up within 18 hours upon notification . PM joins the 1st Battalion , 75th Regiment during its operational preparation cycle . Here we have the chance to observe the regiment 's crawl-walk-run training philosophy in mastering the Fast Rope Infiltration Exfiltration System that quickly delivers large numbers of Rangers from rotary-wing aircraft . Fast-roping is often likened to sliding down a firehouse pole . Only this pole is a 40- , 60- or 80-ft. length of thick , composite nylon rope , with the soldier 's gloved hands acting as the brake . The crawl-walk-run training starts on the battalion 's 50-ft. fixed-platform fast-rope tower where all Rangers demonstrate their ability under increasingly heavy combat loads , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the airfield where the ropes are suspended from different types of helicopters . Finally , members of the unit demonstrate what they have mastered by fast-roping from helicopters during live-fire training exercises . Matching Weapons To Missions The Fast Rope Infiltration Exfiltration System is only one of a plethora of unique combat tools Rangers use to accomplish their demanding missions . " We 're always looking to equip the man and not man the equipment , " explains Keen . " We understand that the most lethal weapon on the battlefield is the individual Ranger , so we want to provide him with the best and most modern equipment but not to purchase equipment just for the sake of purchasing equipment . " Following this philosophy , Rangers are equipped with a wide range of small arms starting with the M4 5.56mm carbine , which includes the Special Operations Peculiar Modification package . The package provides multiple accessory mounting surfaces for optical and aiming devices . Additional modifications include a muzzle  --  mounted sound suppressor , commonly called a silencer . Several Rangers also supplement their small arms arsenal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add-on to the M4 and the standalone M79 provide grenade-launching capability . The sound-suppressed M4 is also one of the weapons available to the Ranger sniper teams . Depending on the adversary they expect to face , other weapon options available to the snipers range from the SR25 7.62mm Stoner rifle from Knight 's Armament Co. - for use in an urban environment-to the M82A1 .50-cal . Barrett sniper rifle . Ranger machine gunners rely on the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon modified with the M5 collapsible paratrooper buttstock and a forward handgrip . Photograph Night vision equipment and the M3 Anti Armor Weapon System ( above ) give the Airborne Rangers the ability to strike by surprise , and hit hard . // One of the most fearsome capabilities of the Ranger regiment is its antitank weaponry . It comes in the form of three company teams equipped with the M3 84mm Ranger Anti Armor Weapon System and the Javelin anti-armor missile . The Airborne Rangers also have an awesome indirect-fire capability , courtesy of each battalion 's mortar section . Mission planners can match the weapon to the threat by choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortar . Rangers On Wheels By definition , the Army 's Airborne Rangers arrive by air . But this does not mean they have to go without wheels . With us in tow , they travel with Land Rover Model 110 Defenders that ride inside CH-47 series cargo helicopters . A dozen of these Ranger Special Operations Vehicles ( RSOVs ) are assigned to Company A in each Ranger battalion . The vehicles operate in three platoons of four vehicles each . " The RSOV is n't a fighting platform , " says 1st Lt. Chris Ayers . " It 's a means of moving people around quickly with crew-served weapons . The whole idea is to move out quickly , put your weapons in place , and defend somewhere with those heavy weapons . " Along with moving Rangers and automatic weapons , other RSOVs are configured for medical transport and moving the battalion 's mortars . Photograph Ranger Firepower The Army 's Airborne Rangers use a diverse arsenal , with the firepower for a particular mission determined by the objective and the anticipated level of resistance . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Ranger 's armory contains 81mm and 120mm versions . Other basic weapons include the : M240B 7.62mm machine gun ; M4 5.56mm carbine with an M203 40mm grenade launcher ; M4 with a forward grip , special optics and a silencer ; M249 5.56mm Squad Automatic ; SR25 7.62mm Stoner sniper rifle ; M79 40mm grenade launcher ; Remington Model 870 12-ga. combat shotgun ; M3 84mm Ranger Anti Armor Weapon System ; and M82A1 .50-cal . Barrett " Light Fifty " rifle . // RSOV platoons are also equipped with a number of military motorcycles . From 1988 to 1995 , the Airborne Rangers relied on the Honda CR 250 . In 1996 , they switched to the Kawasaki KLR250 , which is used today . The 1st Battalion is also experimenting with a new bike , based on the Suzuki DS80 . One of the chief attractions of this smaller bike is that it can be palletized and dropped from aircraft along with the Rangers . As the tip of America 's strategic spear , the Rangers have top-flight radios for communicating among themselves and with commanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a control that straps to the wrist . This eliminates the need to pull the radio from a rucksack during intense operations . And , it underscores the importance of the small details that help the Rangers maintain their winning edge . Live Fire PM catches a glimpse of how well the Rangers ' specialized equipment and hundreds of hours of training come together during the Ist Battalion 's Gunsmoke field exercise , held at Fort Stewart , Ga . This is the " run " part of the training philosophy-the Rangers hone their skills in an environment that closely simulates actual combat . Here , as we watch one group of Rangers arrive in Air Force special operations helicopters , another battalion conducts live-fire missions with M252 81mm mortars , shown on this page . In between these two operations , observers direct the delivery of cannon and rocket fire from 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment helicopters that are hovering only a few feet above the treetops ( " Special Ops , " Jan. 1999 , page 50 ) . Lt. Col. Raymond Thomas , commander of the 1st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is pleased with what he sees , especially the regiment 's tactical flexibility . " From restrictive rules of engagement conflicts to high-intensity urban combat , we can bring all available firepower assets into play , " he says . " This battalion , as with all Ranger battalions , is prepared to fight in all extremes and conditions . " Photograph Rangers are equipped to fight in all climates , from deserts to arctic wastes , and to use the newest communications near .
