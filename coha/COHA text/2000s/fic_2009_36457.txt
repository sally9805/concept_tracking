2005 <p> Eighteen years later . In an apartment in Ann Arbor . In a bedroom hardly bigger than the full bed it contained , Kate Kinzler was waking up . Pinned down by the sandbags of her husband 's limbs , she closed her eyes again , but the dream came back : she was barreling through a grocery-store parking lot , inexplicably fast-45 , 50 mph . She was stomping on the brakes to no effect when a sleek brown Thoroughbred stepped into the aisle , in front of her . A smash of glass and metal , and his body flew through the air . She saw it through the sunroof , impossibly high and falling toward her fast . When she managed to wrestle the car to a stop , he had cracked the pavement , and was writhing and heaving , staring at her . Kate blinked at the dim ceiling . If she fell back asleep , it would go on , get worse . Her dreams often ended in catastrophes of her own making . She woke up most mornings wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her dreams . <p> It was a Sunday , six a.m . Late March , though through the window it still looked like February-lead gray and barren , with sparse piles of snow lining the streets . The trees were budless and black . Next to her , Stuart was giving off a faint snore , huffing out traces of rum . They 'd thrown a party last night , and now the tiny bedroom was littered with dirty clothes and half-empty beer bottles . Stale smoke wafted in from the living room , which was a mess of spills and dirty dishes . They were twenty-nine , full grown , seven years out of college . And still living like this . <p> She peeled herself out from under Stuart , trying not to look at him . His snoring stopped for a second , and she held still until it resumed . From the pile of clothes she put on a sweatshirt and a pair of socks , and pulled her long , frizzy red curls into a knot on the top of her head . Muscling open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mild slope of black tar with cigarette butts scattered around , dropped from the window above by the three college guys who rented the attic apartment . She kicked them toward the gutters and sat down against the wall , drawing her arms and knees up into the sweatshirt . <p> They lived on Packard Street , at the edge of the student neighborhood strewn with plastic cups and abandoned couches . It was just a few blocks from the dorms they 'd lived in as undergrads , and just thirty miles from the Detroit suburb where she 'd grown up . <p> " Hey . " Stuart stuck his head out the window . <p> His sandy , curly hair was mussed , his brown eyes still half-lidded with sleep . He had their blue comforter wrapped around his shoulders , like a boy with a cape . He smiled , locking his eyes on hers as if performing a magic trick in which everything except her disappeared from the world . <p> This was how he got her . Suddenly she thought of Bloody Marys and breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But then it took him two tries to squeeze through the window-he was thin , but clumsy and tall , and plainly still drunk . He dragged their new blanket across the damp , dirty tar and plopped down next to her with a thud that shook the porch . She pulled away . This was how it went lately : her rushes of feeling for him were so brief , so fragile . <p> " What time did you come to bed ? " she said . <p> " I do n't know . After three ? Oh , you missed it-Billy told this story about when he was studying abroad in St. Petersburg- " <p> " And got beat up by the cops ? " <p> " How 'd you know that ? " <p> " And had to sneak out of the hospital in his underwear ? " <p> Stuart nodded incredulously . <p> Billy had been telling that story for years . They 'd been hanging out with the same friends-mostly Stuart's-since college . They got drunk and had the same conversations over and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , mystified . <p> Kate sat quietly , watching the cars move up and down along Packard Street , a 30 mph zone that never cleared out . To the Laundromat . The food co-op . To church , to breakfast , to Kinko 's . Each car probably filled with pairs of mad , wild lovers . <p> " Do I have to go to your folks ' today ? " he said after a while . <p> It was her dad 's birthday . " Nah . If you do the laundry ? " <p> " Deal . " <p> " Deal . " <p> He fell sideways in relief until his head landed in her lap , heavy as a bowling ball . <p> " What 's the matter ? " <p> " Nothing , " she said . <p> He reached one hand up to her jaw . " What did you dream ? " <p> She tilted her head away as politely as possible . <p> She had tried drinking , exercising , pills from her doctor-for anxiety , for depression , for sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had tried telling herself everyone probably felt this way about their partner sooner or later . But she did n't believe it . No one had ever admitted such a thing to her . <p> They watched a college-age couple carrying duffel bags into the Laundromat across the street . The girl gave the guy a bump on the ass with her bag , and he stumbled and laughed , then held the door for her . The cars hissed past on the street , a white noise that you forgot about inside , though it was always there , if you listened . <p> " You should just skip your parents ' , " he said . " You always get this way when you go there . And then depressed after . Always . " <p> Kate came from strivers . Stuart had been a break from all that . The first time she met him , she was hiding out at her usual corner table in the basement of the library , studying for a calculus midterm and twirling a strand of hair from the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind got soft or sleepy , she snapped off a single hair at the root and felt herself spring to attention . She 'd lined up an almost perfect column of A 's on her transcript . And whenever she got scared about her lack of a plan for life after graduation , she pulled out her transcript and felt her heart slow down . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
