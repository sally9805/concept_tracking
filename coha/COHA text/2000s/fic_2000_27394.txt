Two old white ladies came to our village late one day , just before dinnertime , at the beginning of the dry season . Everyone else ran down the riverbank to greet them . I stood at the top . I could see them fine from up there . I had better things to do than run to greet old white ladies . It was Nonti , my mother 's brother 's wife 's brother , who had brought them up the river . When he docked , the two women stayed in the boat . They sat and smiled . Every so often they would talk to each other in some language none of us could understand . And then they would smile some more . Only their mouths moved . The other parts of their bodies were as still as when there is no wind at all , just before a big rain comes . Nonti told us they were called anthropologists . They looked like plain old gringos to me . One was very tall and skinny , with long yellow hair . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat and not tall , but her skin was a funny shade of pink . Her hair was not black enough or straight enough . It was long , but she had no bangs . They both wore no beads , no nose rings , no lip plugs , no anklets . They did n't pierce their noses or their lower lips . They did n't bind their ankles or flatten their foreheads . They did nothing to make themselves beautiful . Elena , my mother 's sister 's daughter , hopped right into the boat where the two women were sitting . She pointed to the tall one 's head and said , " Mapeu ! " Head . They looked at each other and repeated , " Mapeu . " But they said it more like " mopu . " Elena clapped . " Look at them ! This big tall one has hair like thatch.Can you believe it ? We could cut her hair off and patch the hole in our roof ! " Everyone laughed . Even me . Elena always makes me laugh . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what was funny . " Elena , how could you jump into their boat ? " I asked her when she hopped out and came back up the bank to me . " And point at their heads and talk to them ? How could you do it ? I would n't get that close to them . " " Oh , Alicia . You 're such a worrier . What harm could it do ? " " You worry about nothing ! Like a child ! " " You should have more fun , Alicia . That old man husband of yours will come back soon enough . Then will be the time to be worried and unhappy . " " He 's not my husband . My father was drunk when he promised me . I have no husband . My father was drunk ! " I hated it when anyone said I had a husband . I did n't have one . " And your old husband only brings home tiny birds when he goes out hunting , " I told her . " Soon you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat only what he brings home . " Elena laughed and stuck her tongue out at me . Elena would always be fat . Not like meskinny , ugly me . I would never get fat . No matter how much I ate , how tight I tied my honshe , my ankle bands , how much fat medicine my mother gave me . " Skinny Alicia . Your legs look like two cotton threads hanging from your skirt . " Ugly . Elena was beautifulshort , fat , with round cheeks and a big hearty laugh . Elena laughed at everything and everybody . She made fun of people and things all the time . She did it so they would like her . It usually worked . Me , I was not so sociable . The old ladies sat in Nonti 's boat and smiled . What did they want from us ? " Do they speak anything anyone can understand ? " asked Angel , our schoolteacher . Everyone laughed . " Nawa , all nawa are the same , " muttered old man Chichica . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They speak Spanish and something else . They came from the New York City , " Nonti was saying . " And I have taken them on a trip up and down your Paro River , looking for a village to live in . They want to live here , in Poincushmana . " Live here , with us ! Why would they do such a thing ? The old ladies sat and smiled . Everyone started asking questions at once . " Did they bring any liquor with them ? " " Did they bring pictures of their Jesus ? " Swiss missionaries had brought us funny pictures of their god carrying a big , oddly formed piece of firewood , dragging it on his back up a steep hill . " Have they come to steal our children ? " " Have they come to steal the fat from our bodies ? " " Will they kill us all while we sleep ? " Old man Ashandi roared with laughter . " They do n't look like they could even take care of themselves , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall oneshe is so scrawny . You can practically see through her skin , it is so pale . " " They look weak , but they 're not , " Nonti said . " They ask many stupid questions . But they are not mean . They are just incredibly ignorant . " " They will stay at my house , " Papaisi , the headman , announced , and told his daughters to go prepare dinner for the visitors . The old ladies stayed in the boat , still sitting , still not moving . They just sat and smiled . What were these old women doing here , so far away from their homes , from their parents , far from husbands and children ? What could make women travel so far all by themselves ? It was n't until later that we learned the most shocking partthese two women were n't even related to each other . Not in any way . They were what they call friends , amigos in Spanish , no word in Isabo . So they were really alone . One stranger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
