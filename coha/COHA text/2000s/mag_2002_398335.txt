Seinfeld ( with Sascha and Jessica in Central Park in June ) " just relishes every minute with his daughter , " says his sister Carolyn Liebling . " You see it in his face . " Photograph // Jerry Seinfeld enjoys serenity now as an author , documentary star , husband and new father . You 've got ta see the baby ! Coming next fall : CSI : Manhattan . George , Elaine and Kramer try to figure out which end is up on a badly decomposed corpse , while Jerry sidesteps a puddle of blood and keeps his sneakers immaculate . Surely a fan ca n't be faulted for dreaming up scenarios to put Jerry Seinfeld back in prime time , especially considering the lame premises of the two short-lived sitcoms starring Seinfeld alums Michael Richards and Jason Alexander . But four years after his groundbreaking NBC sitcom retired with a send-off audience of 70 million , Seinfeld does n't see himself as must-see TV . " I 've kind of graduated from show business , " he recently told The New York Times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated worth of $250 million , plus a $4.5 million , 3,500-sq. - ft. apartment in Manhattan and a hangar in Santa Monica to house his collection of Porsches . Most days he idles away the morning in his office , refracting ideas into jokes through the great whimsical prism of his mind . Then he 's free to take his daughter Sascha , who turns 2 on Nov. 7 , out for a play date . Or to pull a baseball cap down over his thinning haircut shorter than it used to be-and pop into Zabar 's food emporium for a snack . " He knows the names of all the counter people , " says one of them . " He likes Norwegian salmon . " Says Carolyn Liebling , 50 , his sister and business manager : " When you have the kind of success Jerry had on Seinfeld , you can never go back . " But Seinfeld , now 48 , is definitely rolling forward . More than a year into the sold-out tour that has returned him to his stand-up roots , Seinfeld is the star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary about how he developed the act by trying out new material at small , noisy clubs . " My perception is that Jerry was a standup comedian for years and years , " says his friend , Tonight Show host Jay Leno , " and then for 10 percent of his life , he did a TV show . " Will Seinfeld fans find it ticketworthy ? " Who knows , " says friend and fellow comic Colin Quinn , who appears in the film . " It 's sure not some damned Harrison Ford submarine movie . " No matter : Seinfeld also has three new American Express TV commercials taxiing on the runway . And-a sign that the man whose sitcom mocked ugly babies has softenedthere 's an illustrated kids ' book , Halloween , featuring a little Jerry in trick-or-treat overdrive . ( " Someone 's giving out candy ? Who 's giving out candy ? Everyone we know is just giving out candy ? I got ta be a part of this ! " ) With 325,000 copies sold in less than a month , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jerry , " says his friend , book producer Byron Preiss , who came up with the idea based on a Seinfeld stand-up bit . But that 's work stuff . More exciting to Seinfeld is that he and his wife of three years , Jessica , 31 , a former publicist who now runs her own children 's charity , are expecting their second baby in February . Seinfeld 's daughter Sascha " is the focus of his heart , " says longtime friend and manager George Shapiro . He keeps her photo neatly tucked away in his wallet but recently took it out to show Miramax cochairman Harvey Weinstein , whose company is distributing Comedian . " He 's funny , " says Weinstein , " talking about the baby and the baby to come . He 's become a family man . " Seinfeld has even made parenthood part of the act . Performing recently in Pittsburgh , he told the crowd , " When your eyes meet those eyes ... I never loved anyone so much at first meeting . " As the audience cooed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mistake why these babies come here : To replace us . We 'll see who 's wearing the diapers when all this is over . " Still , Comedian shows him with Sascha in the green room of David Letterman 's Late Show : He lulls her to sleep singing an old Cracker Jack jingle . " That one little girl laughing , " he told the Times , " is better than 3,000 people . " Most nights on the road he hops into his private jet and flies home so he can be there in the morning to greet Sascha when she wakes . " I 've seen him change a couple diapers , " says his sister . " I 've seen him pretty much doing everything . " After Sept. 11 , he brought Sascha along to pay his respects at the fire station in his Upper West Side neighborhood . " He came by with some brownies his wife made , " says a firefighter at Engine 74 . Thanks to his new family , says his manager , " Jerry 's life is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still " in recovery " from Seinfeld , which debuted in July 1989 . For nearly a decade , " he worked 18 , 20 hours a day . It was unbelievable . " Freed from the shackles of prime time , he wanted a happier commitment . " He was anxious to be married , " says Liebling . Anxious in the worst way , it seemed at the time : Seinfeld , who previously dated Shoshanna Lonstein ( now 27 and a designer ) , was first publicly linked with his wife in 1998three weeks after her wedding to Broadway theater heir Eric Nederlander . ( Nederlander quickly filed for divorce . ) But it would be a mistake to think Seinfeld , who wed Jessica in 1999 , rushed in recklessly , says Quinn : " Jerry does n't enter into anything lightly . " The couple , he adds , who sometimes escape to the Long Island mansion Seinfeld bought from Billy Joel for $35 million in 2000 , " have that comfortable thing , a quiet joking . There 's just that vibe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you ask him about candy , it 's still a very thoughtful subject , " says Preiss of his friend ( who , by the way , scarfs Twizzlers ) . " It 's not like you go behind doors with him and he 's calling his broker . He 's still an adolescent at heart . " Not that there 's anything wrong with that .
