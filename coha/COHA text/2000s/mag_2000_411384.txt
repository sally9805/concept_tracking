THE CAMERA PANNED away from a garbage fire in the middle of the street and followed the young men who had set it . The men were calling to a nearby band of demonstrators . " The people are afraid they might be provocateurs , under orders from Castro , " said the television announcer . " This is rowdier than most Miami traffic jams , but it is n't a riot ; it 's the beginning of a catharsis . " The disturbances that followed the removal of Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives ' home by armed federal agents were indeed part of a catharsis , though not its beginning . The outpouring of emotion started months earlier , not on the streets but in homes and churches , away from the television cameras . Some people say they are angrier than they 've been in years , but they are also talking and listening to each other more . If that continues , there is hope for dialogue within the Cuban exile community-which is probably prerequisite for dialogue with the rest of the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a third identify with the fervent anti-Castro old guard . At the other extreme , a small group ( mostly younger and American-educated ) favor normalizing political and economic relations with Cuba , although they remain critical of the Castro regime . In between are what some call the " silent majority , " who visit or send money and material aid to friends and relatives on the island , but avoid confrontation with the old guard . There is little public discussion among these groups . " We do n't talk about dialogue , " says Quaker peace advocate Eduardo Diaz . " Dialoguero has been a fighting word since the 1970s , " he says , for it was a term applied to those who supported negotiations with Castro . Others point out that public disagreement was never an option for ordinary citizens in Cuba , and for Miami Cubans it seems disloyal- " like hanging out our underwear for everyone to see . " Families have their own ways of communicating across the divide . " We know everyone 's viewpoint without making them say it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of dinner we all understand each other , and no one goes away angry . " I once heard two sisters talking about how they had persuaded their father to help pay for an expensive prescription that his brother in Cuba had asked for . " It was scary ; I thought he would choke on his meat , " said one sister . " He knew all along that we were sending Uncle money , " the other reassured her . " It was hard this time because we could n't do it alone , but you watch : next week he 'll be asking how Uncle is doing . " With Elian it was hard to separate the language of politics from the language of the heart . At first he was a safe subject of conversation : an innocent , five-year-old child , plucked from the sea in a miraculous Thanksgiving Day rescue . Of course he would stay , and his father would find a way to join him ; how could the immigration agents gainsay a miracle ? But when Juan Miguel Gonzalez said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became complicated . To deny the father 's right meant overriding the cherished principle of patria potestad-parental or , more literally , paternal authority . For some exile leaders , that was easy to do , since they were struck by the irony of Juan Miguel invoking a right that in Cuba is routinely usurped by the government . But many people were still reluctant to abandon the principle . Said a Cuban-born priest : " You can see how much we care about Elian , if we 're willing to go against patria potestad to save him . " Beneath this debate lay devastating memories of family separation . Some 14,000 Cuban children were sent away by their parents in the 1960s on a church-sponsored airlift called Operation Pedro Pan . Others were torn away from loved ones by Cuban officials , never to hear from them again ; or by the raging sea , as Elian 's mother was . Elian has been a reminder of how divided Cuban families are . It is too painful to talk about , and too important not to . He has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions . Most people agree tat the old guard is losing numbers and energy . " The young have no memory , " one said ruefully on a radio talk show . " And they do n't learn their own history in American schools , only tolerance and political relativism . " Perhaps Elian is changing that , said another : " Young people , children  --  even the imbeciles who talk about ending the embargo-they 're all coming out to demonstrations at the Gonzalez home , and seeing why we care so much . They 're learning about their past , lessons they never got in school . " Those lessons include a litany of perceived betrayals by the U.S. government : the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 , the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 , the post-Mariel agreement to halt the flow of refugees in 1980 , the downing of the Brothers to the Rescue plane in 1996 . Now President Clinton hopes to normalize relations with Cuba in order to expedite trade agreements . It is already a done deal , many exiles said : Clinton would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world economic order . " Folks are suffering right now , " says Eduardo Diaz . " Elian reminds them of all the impotence they 've ever experienced . " Peacemakers call this unresolved anger and mourning , and they know that the appropriate response is to listen to people-without judging , offering reality checks , or pressuring them into dialogue . That has not been the response of the Cuban exiles ' American neighbors . A Miami Herald poll in early April showed that 76 percent of white , non-Hispanic Miamians and 92 percent of African-Americans favored Elian 's repatriation to Cuba with his father , compared to 9 percent of Cubans . The survey director said that in 20 years of polling in Miami , he had never seen results that set Cubans and the other two groups so far apart . A week later , political analyst Max Castro admonished his fellow exiles : " When , after 40 years of preaching the cause , your neighbors in your community are the least convinced people in the world , it 's time for a reality check and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuban  --  born columnist , reflects a more widespread view . She sees indifference to the Cuban cause as " simply another surfacing of America 's antiimmigrant undertow , " especially against the exile community with " its Miami-generated political clout . " The public , she says , " does n't hear the rest of the story . It does n't hear about the refugee parents whose children are still stuck in Cuba because the Fidel Castro government refuses them exit permits . . . It does n't hear about the would-be rafters who are jailed for simply trying to leave the island . " Instead , the press has reduced " our enormously painful history to a few clever , recyclable phrases . " A woman in front of the Gonzalez home was n't blaming the press . She shook her head sadly as people shouted slogans into a reporter 's microphone . " I agree with what they 're saying ; that 's why I 'm here , " she said . " But I would say it differently . " " Then why do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who stole your tongue ? " " People like that , " she said , turning away from him . " They do all the talking . We do n't even try any more . " The struggle over Elian has produced two new forms of political protest , however : a human chain , which was well practiced but could not form in time to stop the sudden , early-morning raid , and a " rolling blockade " of cars driving slowly on major thoroughfares . The rolling blockade was harder to defeat than the human chain , but it also produced more backlash . Cuban-American leaders likened it to the Montgomery bus boycott , but many African-Americans called the comparison a mockery of the civil rights movement-and commuters called it economic strangulation . " Civil disobedience does n't come easily to us , " said one blockade driver . " We have n't seen it work , and we 're afraid of making more enemies . But it was new at first to black people too , and they learned ; so can we . " Some liberals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until now , the group was best known for sailing sport-fishing boats with banners into Cuban waters , a potentially provocative tactic ; and its leader , Ram6n Saul Sanchez , was once associated with violent anti-Castro groups . " It looks like the old guard in sheep 's clothing , " a liberal activist told me . " But I 'd like to be proven wrong . If they are still teaching nonviolence after the Elian battle is over , I 'll be a believer too . A lot of people will . " " Dios to salve Maria , llena eres de gracia . " Besides political slogans , prayer was the most common language in the struggle for Elian . Outside the Gonzalez home , Catholics distributed rosaries and led the Hail Mary ; a few yards away , shouts of " Aleluia ! " and " Amen , Senior ! " bespoke a strong evangelical presence . Catholic and Protestant clergy took turns at a makeshift pulpit every evening , and on Friday they led worship together . " Each of us is willing to sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a Herald reporter . " When we have a service in common we avoid mentioning the things that divide us , like the devotion to Mary , and we center ourselves in our faith in the Lord Jesus . " In contrast to the fervent advocacy of some Cuban-American clergy , the Catholic archdiocese and most Protestant leaders tried to maintain neutrality . Auxiliary Bishop Agustin Roman , who has publicly intervened in other crises , said that the Catholic Church must work with the whole Gonzalez family . Protestant pastors felt " caught in the middle , " one of them told me . " There are many Cubans in our congregations , and also many Americans who strongly support the father . We were really embarrassed by the National Council of Churches ' taking sides with the father . " The district office of the United Methodist Church was also embarrassed when an agency of the church set up a fund for voluntary contributions toward the father 's legal expenses . It was unfortunate , superintendent Clark Campbell-Evans told me later , that the denomination " took action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong way to proceed . " He said the Cuban-American reality is " vital to us as a community of faith ; we have to learn to hear and honor their stories . " United Methodist officials have since promised to come for a Miami meeting , Campbell-Evans said . On Easter Sunday , Miami officials , who were under heavy criticism for allowing police participation in the federal raid the day before , announced plans for a Miami-Dade Mosaic Initiative , led by " dozens of ethnic , civic and religious leaders and economic empowerment agencies . " Robert Simms , a former director of the Community Relations Board , said that , based on experience with the African-American community successful discussion requires leaders in the grieving community " to step forward and articulate the concerns of those who are offended . . . . You let people vent . Then you bring in leaders who can transfer pain into an action plan . " The plan promises wide participation rather than a blue-ribbon panel , but it may not work as quickly as city leaders hope . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievances in recent years . By the 1980s , after long experience in the civil rights movement , the black community had strong leaders and a relatively unified vision . Cuban-Americans are more polarized and less comfortable with public dialogue . And while African-Americans were slowly making their grievances heard , Cuban-Americans were becoming convinced that no one would listen to them . It may take time to reverse that distrust . Most non-Cubans see Elian 's story as a private tragedy turned into a political football by opportunistic politicians ; Cuban-Americans see him as a symbol of their own private tragedies , which are in fact political . " We 're all footballs , " said one . " If you have n't been kicked around as we have , by both Washington and Havana , you wo n't understand . " After 41 years in which a few Cuban-Americans have done most of the talking , the Cuban community should n't be rushed into an " action plan . " It needs time for more venting and dialogue .
