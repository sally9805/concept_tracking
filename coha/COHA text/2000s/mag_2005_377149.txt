Conventional wisdom has long held that mammals spent millions of years in Darwinian limbo . As long as dinosaurs roamed the earth , our distant ancestors never got to be much more than cringing , shrewlike creatures that slinked out at night to nibble timorously on plants and insects when the terrible lizards were asleep . Only when a rogue comet wiped the dinosaurs out , went the story , did mammals begin to earn a little evolutionary respect . <P> But that picture changed dramatically last week with the announcement in Nature of two impressive fossils . One , of a brand-new species dubbed Repenomamus giganticus , demolishes the notion that most dinosaur-age mammals were never larger than squirrels . The animal , which lived some 130 million years ago , had the dimensions of a midsize dog or large badger  --  by far the biggest dinosaur-age mammal ever found . And the second , a new specimen of a previously discovered species called Repenomamus robustus , refutes the notion that it was always the mammals that got eaten . Inside the skeleton where the animal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby dino . " This discovery was the chance of a lifetime , " says Jin Meng , a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and a co-author of the paper . " We ca n't expect to find things like this again . " <P> Indeed , Meng and his colleagues did n't expect to find things like this at all . The smaller skeleton was discovered about two years ago by villagers in China 's Liaoning province , site of some of the richest fossil beds in the world . They brought it to the attention of scientists , who took it to the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing for examination . " We did n't see the stomach contents at first , " says graduate student Yaoming Hu , who is affiliated with the institute and is the lead author of the Nature paper . <P> After they did , however , it did n't take them long to realize they had struck scientific gold . " The teeth showed that the animal 's last meal was a dinosaur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer examination , the scientists determined that the remains were those of a juvenile psittacosaur , a herbivore known to inhabit the region . Some of the arm and leg bones were still attached to each other , suggesting that R. robustus did n't chew its food thoroughly but wolfed it down in large chunks . <P> That proves that at least one mammal from the age of dinosaurs was carnivorous  --  and since R. giganticus is a close cousin of R. robustus , it 's reasonable to assume that the larger species ate meat as well . Moreover , the size and anatomy of R. giganticus , found in the same fossil beds as its smaller relative , suggest that it was an active predator rather than simply a scavenger . " It had a robust body , with short legs that splay out to the side , similar to a Tasmanian devil , " says Meng . " It could walk fast and probably run . It could certainly move better than a crocodile . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
