Dear Dr. Cory : I was wondering why all of my friends have had the chickenpox , but I have n't . My seven-year-old friend said that people have to have the chickpox one time . Can you tell me if people have to have it one time ? Kara Hauser Hamburg , Now York Dear Kara : In the past people sometimes thought that it was better to have chickenpox in childhood so you would n't have to worry about it as an adult . Because chickenpox is caused by a virus , once you have it , you usually do n't get it again . Now thanks to the vaccine that prevents it , you never have to have chickenpox . There are some very serious complications that can occur with chickenpox . For this reason parents are encouraged to have their children vaccinated against chickenpox . Children can receive the vaccine at any visit to their doctor on or after their first birthday . Any child 13 years of age or older who has not had chickenpox or has not been immunized should receive two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Dr. Cory : My bones break so easily . What makes my bones do that ? I broke my arm last year and I have not regained strength in it since then . Why ? Megan Landrum Deer Park , Alabama Dear Megan : Your bones are still growing in size and in strength . By age seventeen and a half , your bones will have grown in strength and size about as much as they are going to grow . The hard part of the bone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium phosphate . The combination of daily exercise and a balanced diet rich in calcium are the keys to developing strong bones . Early development of strong bones will not only help to prevent the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis later in life , but it can also help to decrease your risk of broken or fractured bones as you grow . If your bone has healed properly , your arm should be as good as it was before your injury . Your doctor can make sure your bone has healed the way that it should . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with exercises that will make your arms stronger . Dear Dr. Cory : I 'm only 14 but I have been shedding so much of my hair for the past year that I am scared ! I 'll be bald by the time I am 20 years old . Should I get some treatment for it ? If so , what kind ? Some people that I talk to say it is because of my age . Some say it is because of the water or because I do n't get enough vitamins . Well , I 've tried to balance it out , but it does n't help . I still shed my hair a lot . Could you please give me some advice ? Julia Yefremov Leola , Pennsylvania Dear Julia : A full head of hair normally loses 30 to 60 hairs a day . Just as we shed skin cells , we regularly shed hairs and grow new ones to replace the old ones . After shedding , the live hair follicle that grows the hair takes a rest for a few months , then grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strands at a time or is it coming out in patches ? Some older children or teens can get a condition called " alopecia areata " where the hair falls out in patches . Its cause is unknown but it usually clears up and the hair grows back within 6 to 12 months . People with this condition are often referred to a dermatologist , a doctor who specializes in skin conditions . Certain hair styles or procedures can damage hair and contribute to hair loss : tight braiding or corn-rowing , coloring , as well as curling and straightening chemicals or techniques . Going back to a more natural style usually decreases hair loss caused by these practices . Hair loss can also be due to skin infections , poor nutrition , high fevers , stress , and internal disorders such as diabetes and thyroid conditions . If you are eating a well-balanced diet , getting enough exercise and sleep , and are generally healthy , you may just be experiencing normal hair loss . If your hair loss is more than the normal amount , your doctor will want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue !
