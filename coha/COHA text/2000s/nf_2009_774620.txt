The Good Son // The back porch of the Emerald Park Retirement Center opens onto a large green lawn with a stone walkway that loops through the neatly trimmed grass and curls by a half-dozen benches . It 's not an entirely bucolic scene , though . Over a stucco wall , there is a sprawling strip mall where a pub boasts that it opens " daily at 7 a.m. " // Across the road out front there is a trailer park where residents live in single-wides on cinder blocks and aged RVs with broken headlights . A six-lane highway borders the center on the left , which makes this one of the noisier parts of Hollywood , Florida , with sedans , vans and 18-wheelers blasting past the corporate parks and the multiple storefronts for psychics. // Inside Emerald , where Muzak bathes a vast community room of white tile , Victor Rodriguez feels fortunate . // " It 's a nice place , " Victor says . " I 'm taken care of . " // He looks sturdier than any of the other residents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor , who is 79 . Behind him , a brittle-looking man in blue shorts , black socks and orthopedic shoes is slumped in a chair asleep , oxygen tubes plugged into his nostrils . A woman with a walker moves slowly across the lobby , asking why the room is so cold-again and again . Victor sits next to the glass elevator , upright in his chair , dressed in a crisp short-sleeved button-down shirt and brown slacks with a sharp crease . His jaw is still square . He still resembles the ballplayer he once was . // " My son , Alex , he is , let me tell you , a much better player than I was , " Victor says . " He is the best , I think . But I am a father , so ... " // His son is Alex Rodriguez , the 33-year-old third baseman for the New York Yankees . Alex is the richest player in baseball , set to make nearly $400 million before age 42 , as he glides along a seemingly clear path to pass Barry Bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball . // Alex and his father share the same caramel-colored skin and charming disposition . They both listen thoughtfully , never interrupting . They are both obsessed with neatness and speak with a similar cadence . Victor , like Alex , talks deliberately , with occasional pauses as he searches for the right word . Both men have been through a divorce that involved small children . // Cynthia filed for divorce in July 2008 . When it was finalized in September , ending two months of mud slinging , the iron-clad prenuptial agreement called for Alex to make generous childsupport payments . He moved out of the couple 's dream home , a Mediterranean-style estate on the water in Coral Gables , and put it on the market for $14 million . Cynthia also signed a confidentiality agreement ; if Alex 's secrets were going to come out , they would not be disclosed by his ex-wife . // By the spring of 2009 , the asking price for their estate was reduced to $10 million . Cynthia expected to receive the proceeds from the sale of the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 in a transaction that was mostly in cash , according to mortgage records . Meanwhile , Alex was living in a rental mansion on Star Island , where monthly leases were listed at $75,000 per month even in Florida 's horrifically depressed real estate market . // This enclave for the superwealthy is an artificial landmass shaped like a pill afloat in Biscayne Bay . It 's open to the public , but a guard at a gate takes the names of all who enter to protect the high-profile residents from autograph seekers and groupies . About 30 mansions of various pastel colors rise above the 15-foot hedges along the road . From the homes ' deepwater docks , where 40-foot yachts rest , residents can see the cosmopolitan high-rises of Miami to the west and the sun rise over the Art Deco vibe of South Beach to the east . // The glitziest of Miamians live here . Alex liked the idea of being one of them . Over the years , sugar cane magnates , financial barons , and entertainers such as Madonna , Sylvester Stallone , Shaquille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The Emerald Park Retirement Center is about 20 miles-and at least several tax brackets-away . Victor lives in an apartment ; they typically rent for about $2,200 a month , but he does n't pay a nickel . " Alex is a very good son , " he explains . " Of course , I never ask him for nothing , but he helps me . He does n't want me to pay for where I live . But I never ask . " ( Victor wo n't live here for very long . In early 2009 , he moved to another retirement enclave-with luxury upgrades. ) // He has n't spoken to Alex in several weeks . They were estranged for almost 20 years but reconciled in 2003-to a point . Part of Alex still ca n't fully embrace a father who left the family when he was 10 . Victor reads about his son in the papers and hears about him through the entertainment news . " I worry about Alex and Cynthia , " Victor says . " I hear about Madonna . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchildren , but the conversations are short . " // It 's before the holidays . He expects to see Alex but understands if he does n't . He does n't push Alex for fear of losing him again . " He 's so busy , " Victor says . " He has so many dealings . He is doing many big things at once . " // Victor was always ambitious , too . // Victor Rodriguez was born in a verdant valley below the Cordillera Mountains of the Dominican Republic , in the village of San Juan de la Maguana . Shacks and small houses in hard-candy hues of yellow , pink and blue dotted the valley ; most of them had walls made from palm trees and roofs made of dried branches and palm fronds . Victor remembers his town as an agrarian idyll-good land for rice fields and , farther into the plains , good grazing land for cattle . Donkeys pulled wagons loaded high with burlap sacks of grain , sugar and coffee beans over dirt roads toward San Juan de la Maguana . Men played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell in the market . " No one was rich , " he says . " We did n't know what rich was . Everyone was in the same situation . " // Victor was born in 1929 , one year before General Rafael Trujillo seized power in the Dominican Republic . Trujillo ruled for the next 31 years , regularly winning 95 percent of the vote through fraud and threats , bribes and violence . " He was all that I knew , " Victor says . " Let me tell you , he was one terrible dictator . He controlled everything . He abused people . He was cruel in many opinions . " // Trujillo was a diabolical despot who promulgated a cult of personality ; he erected statues of himself throughout the country and renamed the capital Ciudad Trujillo ( night and day , a large electric sign there blazed the words Dios y Trujillo- " God and Trujillo " ) . // Trujillo was also a brazen and brutal racist who tried to purge the African strain of his people ; he dreamed of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even used bleach to whiten his own brown skin . // Yet , despite his ironfisted persona , Trujillo fancied himself a refined gentleman with a sophisticated taste for fine art and racehorses . He loved equine pursuits , but he was savvy enough to understand how sport could play a role in perpetuating his stranglehold on his country . Baseball , he knew , would be an excellent distraction from his political manipulations . He encouraged the sport 's popularity . His son ran a team in Santo Domingo . // " Everyone played baseball to escape and dream , " Victor recalls . " We talked about it all the time . We breathed it . In every city , it was the sound of a bat and a ball that thrilled everyone . By the time I was seven , I played every day . " // The children played even when they had no gloves , no bats , no balls . The gloves of poor children were sometimes made from milk cartons or old socks . A broomstick or even a large wooden spoon might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tape . " Everyone played without knowing what a glove really felt like , " Victor says . " Your hands hurt , but we were crazy for baseball . For us , baseball was life . Boys and even the girls played . All the cities , no matter how small , had at least two teams . It was a small island , but it had so much talent . " // The D.R. 's thrumming amateur leagues first caught the eye of American baseball scouts in the 1950s when the amazing Juan Marichal was signed . He was a different kind of pitcher , one never seen before , with a high leg kick that gave him the vertical look of an exclamation mark . He became the nation 's first major-league superstar when he left the island to play for the San Francisco Giants in 1960 at age 23 . " He was the beginning for us , " Victor says . " He was a great , great hero . He brought so much good to the Dominican when he went to the major leagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor was a talented catcher who had a strong arm and a fine grasp of the game-calling pitches was his forte-but he never emerged as one of the country 's top stars . " I never played professionally , " he says . " I did n't play for money . " He played organized ball for 18 years , though , from age 18 to 36 , until injuries finally forced him to stop . // Victor poured his soul into baseball , but he did n't neglect his studies or restrict his dreams to sports . He was a well-read young man with a keen interest in current events , and his circle of friends included many polished professionals and businessmen . Politics was a close second to baseball as their favorite topic of discussion . // It is unclear how intensely active Victor was as a revolutionary . Former teammates of Victor 's remember him as a good catcher and simple man . Others who lived through the Trujillo era believe that Victor was a freedom fighter and a member of the underground resistance in the late 1950s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de la Maguana also portrays Victor as a rebel leader . Juan Rivas , who grew up in San Juan de la Maguana , says Victor was the editor of an anti-Trujillo newspaper near the end of the dictator 's reign . " Victor was a very smart man , " Rivas says . " He was a brave man . " // ( Continues ... ) //
