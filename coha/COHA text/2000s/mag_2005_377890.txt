Nicole Kidman is the go-to actress for a certain kind of grownup movie , and she keeps proving why she gets those juicy roles . It 's because she can do almost anything . She has a unique knack for letting a wide range of characters live inside her ; they radiate through that translucent skin . <P> This time she 's Silvia , a U.N . interpreter with a murky agenda and half the goons of an African country on her slim tail . Sean Penn is Keller , the federal agent assigned to figure out what she 's hiding . Is she simply a victim ? Or is grief driving her to assassination ? <P> Grieving is the appropriate mode in this middling Sydney Pollack effort ; the leads ' backstories are littered with the corpses of loved ones . Keller has just lost his wife in a car crash , Silvia most of her family back home in Africa , under the bloody rule of the man who is about to deliver an address to the General Assembly . Add Keller 's private anguish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the international-intrigue plot , and there 's enough narrative for three fine films . <P> But not enough for The Interpreter . The thriller pieces feel assembled rather than organic : this from The Manchurian Candidate , that from Pollack 's own Three Days of the Condor , the rest from the Robert Ludlum oeuvre . And the issue of whether a genocidal dictator will be killed does n't have much emotional weight . Nor does the moral question  --  Can a person do good by killing a bad man ?  --  mean a lot when a star is pointing a gun at a defenseless supporting player . <P> Once you scuttle hopes of Hitchcock-level espionage , you can enjoy the suspense of half a dozen people with murderous intent squeezed onto a Brooklyn bus ; the geometry of stares , whispered messages and sudden shifts of body weight is well calibrated . Penn keeps you wondering whether he 's going to im- or explode . Catherine Keener shines in support as Penn 's sidekick and just about the only sensible person in the movie . <P> Then there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by restless strands of her long hair , effortlessly commands an audience 's eyes , suspicion and fascination .  --  By Richard Corliss
