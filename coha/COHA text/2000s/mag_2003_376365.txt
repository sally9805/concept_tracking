The chalk markings appeared on the sidewalk a few days after I moved into my new house . A symbol that looked like two half-moons back to back was scrawled beneath the words " Outside the Box . " What did it mean ? Was it some bizarre pagan ritual conducted by aficionados of business slogans ? Nope  --  Outside the Box was the name I had assigned on my computer to my wi-fi network . There was only one explanation : I 'd been warchalked . <P> Warchalking began a couple of years ago in London , and has since spread to the sidewalks of Seattle , New York City and San Francisco . Wireless guerrillas walk or drive around a city with wi-fi  --  enabled laptops , sniffing out wireless networks . They leave hieroglyphs that , to the untrained eye , look like graffiti . The symbols not only alert those in the know to a hot spot but also reveal how fast the network is and whether it requires a password . No password required for me  --  hence the open-faced moons . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice was inspired by stories of Great Depression  --  era hoboes who left chalk markings outside the most charitable houses . It was hard for me to imagine a gang of digital hoboes so hard up for Internet access that they had to squat outside my house , huddled around a Thinkpad . But if they did , I could hardly chase these virtual varmints away with a broom . After all , my network was open . It was as if I had left milk and cookies on the sidewalk . They would n't be trespassing on my property . Or would they ? <P> On websites like
