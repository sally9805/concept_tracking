I eyed it dubiously - not only was it old , with the long sentences and leisurely unfolding of plot that implied , but it was hardly what you would call a " boy 's book . " But my 10-year-old son was attracted to the lavish cover and gorgeous paper , and we needed something to read , so I gave it a try . He loved it . I loved it .

And lo and behold , all three of my boys , in turn , became engrossed by the story of sullen little Mary and the spirited country children who bring her out of her shell .

Great books - both old and new - stand the test of time and they 're satisfying for readers and listeners of all ages . " Where to start ? We polled three children 's librarians - Ken Setterington , children and youth advocate at the Toronto Public Library , Kathleen Pine , manager of the children 's division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting places . But as Pine says , you have to fine-tune for your own child . " The last thing you want is for it to become a chore . If you start out reading a book and it 's not working , stop rather than go through 200 pages and have the child hate it . Find something he loves . " The only caveat is for you both to be aware that long-ago authors did not necessarily feel compelled to have the action start on page two , so encourage your child to give a book enough time - maybe a couple of chapters - to get into the story .
