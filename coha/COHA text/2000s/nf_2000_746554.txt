Section : LAW PRACTICE Understanding what your client is really saying makes for successful lawyering <p> If lawyers were a species unto themselves  --  and many people are convinced they are  --  some of their skills would be studied as near miracles of adaptation . <p> Think for a moment about a lawyer 's ability to listen . Like a falcon that scours the ground from dizzying heights , spots something moving and instantly determines its mealworthiness , a lawyer scans the environment for information , captures it , analyzes it and uses it to build a case to solve the problem at hand . <p> Unfortunately , while this process is going on inside the lawyer 's head , the client may be sitting across the desk feeling lost . <p> She does n't know whether she 's been seen . She is n't sure whether she has recounted everything relevant . And worse , she 's wondering whether she and her lawyer are occupying the same psychic space . Or even the same planet . <p> Law practice is all about words , whether they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons  --  most unintentional  --  words often end up , instead , keeping lawyers and clients at a distance . When that happens , something essential is lost : the lawyer 's opportunity to experience the satisfaction that comes from connecting with  --  and helping  --  another human being . <p> Lawyers who make it a point to really listen understand that too much talking and not enough listening throws things off balance . They realize that listening is how they bring a client 's world into their own . When more of that world gets m , their chances of being successful counselors and advocates increase . <p> Listening this way also happens to be good business . In a profession in which most practitioners are pretty strong technically , being a good listener can be a way to distinguish yourself . The Need to Be Heard <p> Intuition tells us that having the feeling of being heard is an important component of happiness . If you need proof , science can provide it . <p> In one of the better-known studies , James J. Lynch , author of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Dialogue , found that when we listen to people , their blood pressure goes down . Lynch understood this when he noticed that crying babies ' blood pressure continued to rise the longer they cried . <p> " I realized that 's exactly what the adult patients do , but their cries are inward , " he says . " And I began to understand that listening to people lowers their blood pressure because we hear their cries . " <p> The importance of listening to those cries is something James Nelson , a former chief judge of the Los Angeles Municipal Court , learned about his first day on the bench , in Small Claims Court . <p> " I had a case in which a lady had sued a dry cleaner for damaging her clothing , " he recalls . " Well , when she got through presenting her case , I was n't even clear about whether or not she was even suing the right dry cleaner . She just did n't seem to have a case . <p> " So as soon as she was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that point , the dry cleaner almost attacked me . I thought he was going to jump over the bench and grab me , so I said , ' Sir , sir , I just ruled in your favor . The case is over . ' But he was furious . He said , ' I wanted to tell you about what this woman did ! ' And at that moment I realized that most people would rather be heard than win . There is some kind of spiritual principle involved in hearing people . " <p> Maybe the principle is that although adjudication may cure a legal problem , healing requires that the parties feel they have actually been heard . To put it into the law office context , if a client needs to be heard , merely listening to the words while tuning out the person behind the problem will rarely do the trick . How Busy Lawyers Listen <p> If there were such a thing as a distraction index , it would probably be off the charts these days , reflecting overscheduled days and constant demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to everyone , so it is n't fair to single out lawyers for failing to be good listeners . They are probably no worse at it than other professionals . After all , their work requires that they listen , and listen well  --  at least up to a point . <p> Marrilyn Astin Tarlton , a law firm management consultant who also teaches at the University of Denver College of Law , says , " Lawyers constantly listen and analyze what they ' re hearing , but only until they get to the point where they think to themselves , ' Ah , I know the answer . ' Then they do n't hear what comes next . " <p> Tarlton says certain unique factors in lawyers ' training and legal culture make it especially hard for them to listen beyond that moment . First , they are trained in law school and in practice that people come to them for one thing : to get answers . Given that , " It 's easy to get into a pattern where you want to know the answer real fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the Socratic method used in law schools conveys a simple message : He who knows the answer gets the prize  --  and , Tarlton says , it is no wonder that lawyers tend to listen with a narrow focus on getting the right answer . There appears to be little incentive to listen any deeper or longer than necessary to do that . <p> But is there ? It depends on how you perceive your role as a lawyer . " I believe that when a client goes to see a lawyer , he or she wants more than just a legal fix , " says David Hall , assistant provost of Boston 's Northeastern University and former dean of the law school there . <p> " When I go to the store to buy a loaf of bread , I want to be treated a certain way by the cashier , and when he does n't look me in the eye and say hello , or acknowledge my presence , I feel diminished by the experience . And I 'm not coming to him in crisis , hurting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I would with a lawyer . " <p> Surveys have repeatedly shown that clients look for more than technical proficiency from a lawyer . They want to know that the lawyer hears and cares about their problems . In fact , a great many lawyer disciplinary actions can be traced to a failure to listen . After all , when clients complain that their lawyers refuse to return phone calls , are n't they really saying that they do n't feel heard ? What to Listen for <p> When it comes to working with clients , really listening means much more than accepting a list of facts at face value , finding a recognizable pattern and plugging it into a standard solution . It also means : <p>  --  Listening through role-playing . Clients often behave according to some notion of how a client is supposed to behave . <p> If you can detect this , and realize that such suppositions become filters  --  allowing only certain things to be expressed and others withheld  --  you have a chance to get at underling facts and feelings that might bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things . If you stop as soon as you 've got the answer , you may be closing yourself off to better options . Perhaps the client has a way to resolve the problem that is outside your experience but may be effective . Do n't ignore the client 's wisdom in your rush to get the right answer . Listening to your intuition . The legal culture does n't exactly embrace this source of knowledge , but that does n't mean your hunches and inklings should n't be respected and explored . If your gut tells you something is wrong with the picture , listen and check it out . Listening for clients ' listening problems . Clients who do n't listen can be maddening . They fail to give useful feedback and they waste time . Being aware of this problem early in the relationship gives you the opportunity to deal with it  --  directly and with tact  --  before it leads to abject frustration . <p> In an interesting twist on this suggestion , Tarlton , the Denver consultant , describes an extremely bright client of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often works . <p> " But sometimes he just stops listening . I can see him go away . So periodically I 'll have to say , ' I know you 're finished listening to me , but I have information I need to convey and I need you to listen . ' " He does , and , says Tarlton , he loves it when she calls his attention to it . <p> Keep in mind that encouraging clients to become better listeners can pay off . Their experience causes them to pick up on different nuances than you do , nuances you might miss that could prove decisive . <p> One rule to remember when your goal is to listen deeply is that judgment is deadly . No one wants to be judged while revealing personal information , so it is essential to offer the speaker a sympathetic , nonjudgmental ear . <p> The trick is to be aware of any tendency to judge the speaker 's ideas , use of language , appearance , or anything else . If you find yourself judging , do n't berate yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it and let go of the judgment so that you can turn your attention to the speaker and the message . It Takes Time <p> Merit Bennett , author of Law and the Heart and a partner at the law firm of Tinkler &; Bennett in Santa Fe , N.M. , says he encourages clients to " talk themselves out . " <p> " I will let them talk and I 'll ask questions to help them get what they came to say out , " he says . " But I 'll also allow them to explore how they feel about what they just said . " <p> That , Bennett says , is where the gold is . <p> " They come in with facts and ideas and behavior and all the rest , and after it 's all on the table , it 's easy for me to play the lawyer and figure out what the legal issue is , analyze it , come up with a course of action and so on . But what happens behind that  --  and usually it 's in a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , about the conduct of the other party , about what happened to them , and about what kind of an outcome would give them a good feeling . <p> " Once you go there , it 's like you 've opened up the door and the answer just comes , " Bennett says . " It comes right out of the client 's mouth . Suddenly you see what the real issue is . It 's usually not what they came in with . Usually it 's about hurt , and I get them to talk about why they are hurt , how to get at it and how to heal it . Suddenly it resolves itself at a whole other level . " <p> Bennett has learned it can be dangerous to push a client toward a result without listening to all the subtleties of what is being said . " If you do push too quickly into the case , and you fail to get to the feelings and the underlying issues , the case will often fall apart down the line , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a motion for summary judgment , and it 's because you did n't go far enough  --  you did n't listen well enough at the outset . I 'm really careful with this , and I guess it comes from the fact that in my younger days I was burned too many times by jumping on people 's horses , then getting too far out on the prairie and finding myself surrounded . " <p> There is significant danger , Bennett says , in simply accepting what the client initially tells you , which ordinarily is limited to what supports his or her position and justifies a desire to get back at the other guy . " When you do n't explore the underlying feelings , you often do n't reach the underlying facts . So getting to that level  --  by really listening well  --  is another way to make sure you develop the factual scenario so that nothing unforeseen happens . " <p> Listening well takes effort . But according to psychologist Lynch , it is also deeply satisfying and relaxing . His research shows that not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also lowers the listener 's . <p> There is something about forging the kind of basic human connection that good listening makes possible that calms and comforts everyone . Any fears that it will deplete your energy available for the rest of your law practice  --  if you 're listening openly  --  are misplaced . Hearing Aids for Lawyers <p> In any conversation , there are ways to be a better listener . Here are a few : Stop talking . It 's much easier to It 's much easier to receive information when you 're not also transmitting it . Allow the room to be silent . When you resist the temptation to fill the silence , you make room for what often turn out to be significant revelations . Limit distractions . Block incoming phone calls , move to a quieter room or put a " Do not disturb " sign on your office door . Listen with the intention of understanding , instead of replying . Be aware of the message your body and your face are sending to the speaker . Listen for meaning in a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way the speaker says them , in body language , and in what he or she is not saying . Tell yourself that nothing else matters at the moment but what the speaker is trying to say to you . <p> By STEVEN KEEVA <p> <p> Steven Keeva is a senior editor of the ABA Journal .
