A short history of the grudge match : The Hebrews invented it . Cain was the first winner , but God disqualified him on the grounds of poor sportsmanship . Abel was awarded the gold posthumously . <P> A longer history of the grudge match : The ancient Greeks invented games as a way of allowing men to fight one another without all that messy killing . Sport was literally a lifesaving idea : I hit you , you hit me , and an impartial observer determines who wins . ( This became known as boxing . ) I insult you , you trip me and the rest of the clan decides who played dirty better . ( This became known as politics . ) <P> These Olympics , like those that preceded them , are conducted in the spirit of fair play and sportsmanship  --  at least until the competition starts . Everything was a grudge match in the cold war days , when , for the U.S. , winning against the Russians and their vassals was a patriotic duty . Now it 's much more complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lithuanians  --  but one can learn . <P> From classical times to today  --  roughly , from Ben-Hur vs . Messala to the Rock vs. the Undertaker  --  grudge matches have spiced the playing and watching of sport . Badminton ? Fiercely contested by the Chinese and the Danes . Volleyball ? Watch out for that Cuba-Brazil match . Swimming ? You should hear the trash talking . Basketball ? Everyone would love to knock our block off . Man was not automatically civilized simply because he agreed to live , or play , by the rules . He did not abandon rancor , envy or the thirst for vengeance . Just watch any match between Yugoslavia and Croatia . <P> For every dispassionate contest pitting nature 's noblemen against each other , there is , or ought to be , one in which a festering resentment sends a sick thrill through the arena . Why get mad ? Because your rival got stupidly lucky . Because your rival took more effective drugs than you did . Because some friends of your rival clubbed you on the knee a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined slight goads the grudging one to greatness . Revenge spurs nearly every movie plot ; why should n't it juice the adrenaline that an athlete needs to excel ? <P> An athlete , at least a smart one , does not say publicly , " I 'm gon na kill him . " Such a statement , circled in red Magic Marker and tacked to a locker-room bulletin board , can be as inspirational as a Gipper speech . So this year 's Olympians will murmur only the mildest bromides . But some of them , in this Grudge Report , will quietly nurse their enmity to find a focus for their few moments in the quadrennial sun . The old Olympic rule applies : Get mad ; get even .
