Schizophrenia is the most personally destructive and least understood of all the major mental illnesses . Its principal hallmark is extremely disordered thinking  --  the kind that robs many of its victims of the ability to keep a job , maintain a relationship or even hold a coherent conversation . The first serious symptoms typically begin sometime after puberty , in the late teens or 20s . Some but not all schizophrenics suffer hallucinations . Some but not all schizophrenics hear voices . The cause is undeniably physical  --  perhaps the unhappy combination of a genetic predisposition and an infection suffered in the womb . In any event , it 's clear that the results can be heartbreaking . <P> In this way , schizophrenia affects far more than one person at a time . For a look at its extended impact , TIME visited one family to see how schizophrenia touched its members across four generations and how the family coped with the disease . In some ways , their story is uncommon  --  most schizophrenics do n't have a family history of the disorder . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stigma and isolation of a mental illness , the Beales of Howard , Ohio , are all too typical . <P> Ed Beale , 65 , never knew his mother , Emma , a vivacious former schoolteacher with a knack for picking up foreign languages . When she was 30 and Ed was just 7 months old , she was committed to a psychiatric institution with what the family later recognized as schizophrenia . When Ed was 3 , his dad told him that his mother had died soon after giving birth to him . Although she actually lived until 1973  --  when Ed was 36  --  he never met her , heard her voice or kissed her cheek . <P> Lying seemed easier than telling the truth . " His father wanted it to be a secret , " says Ed 's aunt Virginia Conrad , who eventually told Ed practically everything he knows about his mother . " There was a lot of embarrassment about it . " For a while , Ed blamed himself for his mother 's condition  --  he wondered if his birth had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his mind and go on with his life . He joined the Air Force and married his wife Velma . They had three children . <P> But the specter of schizophrenia returned with their third child , Peter . A happy , precocious youngster who learned to read in kindergarten , Peter focused less and less on school as he got older . It was n't until after he joined the Air Force in 1985 , however , that his life truly began to deteriorate . Peter remembers sitting next to another student in a training class and telling him about what seemed to him to be a wondrous , novel idea . " But then he just looked at me funny , " Peter recalls . " He says to me , ' You are n't saying anything . You 're just making noises . ' " <P> Peter started having delusions that interfered with his military duties . " I often thought I was being followed or that people were hiding in the trees waiting to come after me . " Eventually , he says , his thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't focus on anything . " Finally , the Air Force court-martialed him for dereliction of duty , and he was given a less than honorable discharge . Still , neither he nor his parents were ready to accept the idea that he had a mental illness  --  although by then his grandmother 's history was no longer a secret . " Maybe we were trying so hard to forget , " says Velma.
