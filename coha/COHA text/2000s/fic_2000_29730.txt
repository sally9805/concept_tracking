Stephan " How many womens you got now , boy ? " When I was in the third grade , my daddy came to visit us . I marveled at how dapper my old man was . Head to toe , he was always clean . Daddy leaned back in our tattered , creaking love seat , then glanced over my elementary school report card . He grunted as he puffed a hand-rolled cigarette . My old man was bland about my attendance being perfect , nonchalant about my conduct being above satisfactory . He even showed a touch of enthusiasm about my finally making the honor roll . After a few draws , he put his unfiltered smoke out in the red tin ashtray with one powerful twist of his wrist , took a gulp from his leather-cased flask , sipped a time or two , then yanked me tight against his side . He put his face close to mine and grinned . " You hear me , Stephan ? C'm on , you can tell me . I 'm yo ' daddy . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gold tooth shined when he whispered , " How many womens you got now ? " If I told him I had one , he 'd call me a sissy . Two , a punk . A punk was an upgraded sissy , I thought . A giver , not a taker . But still not a real man . " Got me three womens now ! " I bugged out my brown eyes and smile-lied , using eagerness to pump it up and make it sound real . " Good . " Daddy smiled , gripped me with his callused hands , and pulled me up into his lap next to his damp face . Mississippi 's humidity kept his roan complexion dank . He beamed and said , " Then you a man now , nigger . We mens . " I smiled at his acceptance . " When you gets to be a big boy , you know what you ' pose to do to womens , doncha ? " I shook my head . He whispered , " Find ' em . Fool ' em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what he meant , but the words stuck in my head . Momma came into the room long enough to ask Daddy , " Where 's yo ' wedding ring at ? Why ai n't you got it on ? " He grinned , winked at her , then started tickling my stomach . Momma looked outside at the passenger in his car , looked back at him , picked up her Bible , held it tight to her chest , then walked into the kitchen with her eyes closed . Walked like a woman gone blind . Her lips moved , like she was praying for strength . Each step was lead heavy . After Daddy watched our black-and-white television 's fuzzy picture for a couple of minutes , he reached into his pocket and gave me all of his loose change . Then he swaggered to his Buick Wildcat and drove off with some high-yellow woman . A woman in a big pink hat . The lady who chain-smoked and stared at our house every second he was inside . His Wildcat kicked dirt clouds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I waved . He never looked back . As the dust faded , I shook my pocket . Smiled at the rich noise it made with each jingle . It rang like a child 's fortune . I was n't sure why he gave me the reward-if it was because of my grades or my womens . Either way , I was a whole dollar richer . Momma never said anything about his dropping by off-and-on to visit us unannounced and leaving an irritated female in the car . Almost every time a different nameless female . He 'd been gone all summer ; that was the longest he 'd stayed away . And now when he dropped by , he never hung around but a few long minutes . He never cut his car engine off . Right before he grabbed his fedora-his signal to us he was about to leave-he would try to kiss Momma on the cheek . But she 'd always move and twist her face into an evil look . He 'd laugh , then try to hand her a fistful of crumpled-up money . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd give up a wry smile and drop the wrinkled greenbacks on the faded coffee table . After he left , Momma always went into her bedroom , turned off the light , and closed the door for a long time . Usually the rest of the night . Quiet . She 'd always be withdrawn for a few days . Even when Daddy 's game was weak and he was cold busted with another babe , Momma always let him come back . It seemed like it was inevitable . All he 'd have to do was say he was sorry , I mean real fucking sorry , confused by love . Look sad . Pitiful . And be humble , on his knees right in front of Momma and his two sons . A real , stupid humble . And , if he could manage it , cry . But he never overdid the crybaby routine . That would ring out as contrived . But he cried like a man standing before his savior confessing his sins . Then left the walls of salvation , hit the liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My sweet mother was a real woman . A sensitive woman who more than anything believed in family . Why did she keep taking him back when she knew he was a dog ? Most women got this thing called compassion . It does n't make them foolish , just more forgiving . More capable of trying and hoping things worked out . The day Daddy told me I was a man was the last time Momma let him see us . She 'd had enough . Enough of him . Enough of the pretty women he kept on his arm . That was the last time he set foot in our house . The last time Daddy held me in his lap . I remembered thinking I 'd be like my daddy . A real man . I would n't be a punk neither . Darnell and Dawn knocked on my door around nine . Dawn never used my doorbell and banged like I owed her money . I had slipped on my spandex shorts and T-shirt almost thirty minutes ago when I got up to turn on the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the living room by the front door so they 'd know I was ready . Dawn was an almost six-foot-tall , borderline full-figured , scratchy-voiced sister from Brooklyn . Her arrogant eyes were the first thing I saw through the peephole . Darnell was a little over five-eleven , chestnut complexion , slight receding hairline , built like a linebacker , arms almost as big as my legs , his belly getting a little on the pudgy side . They were dressed in matching baggy black shorts and oversized T-shirts , the sleeves rolled up to the shoulders . " Hey , babe , " Dawn said in her typical tart tone . Her assertive East Coast accent rang out . We hugged . " You smell nice . " I said , " I took my weekly bath . " " Good . I was going to talk to you about that . " " Whuddup ! " That was Darnell . Dawn rolled her eyes . She hated it when he got too stupid too soon . She stretched and said , " You ready ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse , " Darnell said . He headed toward the bathroom . Dawn went to the kitchen and made herself a huge glass of orange juice , then peeped into the bedroom . She whispered , " Who 's this one ? " " Samantha . " " Have I met her before ? " " I think so . " " Where ? " " I think you met her at Kenneth Hahn Park when my momma and Pops had that family picnic . Last year when my sister Jackie came home from Spellman for spring break . " " If you 're talking about last year when I met your other two brothers , then nope , that was a tall , tanned girl with long brown hair that I met . She was my partner when we played dominoes and we whooped everybody , including you and your momma . " I reminded her who that was when I said , " Brittany . " " You tell me . You need to make ' em wear name tags . " I said , " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ai n't shit . " " Love you , too . " Samantha had driven down from L.A. at four this morning , came by to get some loving before sunrise . Dawn shook her head and walked back into the kitchen . " She 's not going with us ? " " Nope . She 'll probably sleep until we get back . " Samantha moaned , rolled over , almost opened her eyes . Dawn stepped away from the bedroom door . I moved into the bedroom , eased the door up behind me . " Hey , sexy . " Samantha cleared her throat , pulled the sheets up over her bare breasts , said a weak " Who were you talking to , Stephan ? " Samantha 's dark nipples were like beautiful blackberries sitting on top of small , elegant mounds of chocolate-coated joy . Her twenty kisses were juicier than a ripe berry , twice as sweet . I ran my hand across her short , curly hair , massaged the back of her neck . " You heard Dawn , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawn ? " " Darnell 's wife . " Samantha yelled , " Hey , Dawn . Stephan told me about you . " " Hello , Samantha , " Dawn called out from the other side of the door . " Nice to see you again . Did n't mean to wake you . " " It 's okay . " Samantha waved one of her hands in the direction of the voice . " Stephan , what 're you doing ? " " Saturday morning racquetball . " " That 's right . " " You want to go ? " She sighed . " Can I stay here until you get back ? " " Why do n't you come work out ? Sleep later . " She cursed . " You have an extra racquet ? " " Of course . " Which was good . I did n't want to leave her here in my space all by herself . She might do a Columbo and go through my condo from ceiling to carport . Find something that she did n't need to find . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slid my finger inside her , made her moan . Slid my digit deeper until I could n't slide it in anymore . Used two fingers . Moved them in and out in a slow , stirring rhythm . I knew how to wake her up . Samantha wiggled and pushed my hand away . " Do n't start something you ca n't finish . " I smiled . I yelled , " Dawn , Samantha 's going with us . " Dawn yelled back . " Okay . I need some female bonding . " We all laughed . Samantha whispered , " Have I met her before ? " " What ? " " She said it was nice to see me again . I 've never met her . " Samantha had a false smile on her questioning face . I smiled , ignored that question . " Hurry and get showered . " Samantha 's eyes changed , became sultry , and she asked , " Is that door closed all the way ? " I nodded . She pulled my hips up to her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penis . Moved it up and down , kissed it like it was a newborn child , slid it into her mouth like she was easing that baby in its favorite cradle . I gasped and made a mmmm sound . So warm . So good . Her eyes were on me as she licked around me , then slurped , pulled me in deeper . Dawn drove us down the hill to L.A. Fitness , where she had reserved a racquetball court . We played doubles , first couples against couples , then the guys against the dolls . Dawn was as vicious on the courts as she was in her real estate office . Aggressive , smooth . Hardly moved , but when she did , it was with a definite athletic rhythm . Samantha looked studious and dangerous because she crouched low and wore protective goggles . She 'd calculate where the ball was going to land and be there before it knew where it was going . Darnell played too hard . He ran into the wall a lot and hit the ball damn hard , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even from back court . Whenever he missed a shot , he 'd look at his brand-new racquet like it was defective . I 'd find out each of their weak spots and concentrate on playing that angle . Dawn 's backhand was inconsistent and sucked from deep in the court because her racquet kept bumping into the wall , cutting her return short . Darnell would get mixed up on a three-wall shot . I 'd use the back wall for awkward returns and mix it up with ceiling shots to try to break their rhythms . Samantha was n't as agile and swift on the court as she was in bed . Me and Samantha won the first game by two . Dawn and Darnell won the next two without a lot of effort . When we switched partners , guys against dolls , Dawn said , " Samantha , let 's kick these bitches ' asses . " Darnell chuckled and bobbed his head . " It 's on . " I shouted a warning , " No mercy for those who menstruate . " Grunts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me and Darnell struggled and won a game , beat Dawn and Samantha by three points . The last game the dolls beat us by four . We had thirty minutes left on the court , but we were all beat because each game had lasted almost twenty-five minutes . Silliness took over and I staggered , overacted , like I was trying to catch a second wind . I sat and tried to stretch my already worn-out muscles . The sounds of rubber balls bounced off the walls ; the screech of tennis shoes echoed around us . My T-shirt was soaked from chin to waist because I had kept wiping my face on it . We crashed on the hardwood floor , Dawn next to Darnell , Samantha and me across the court , sharing a bottle of Sparkletts water . My back was on the floor , feet up against the wall . Samantha sat with her legs spread apart , and she stretched side to side , then face to the floor . Dawn said , " Shit , Samantha . If I was that flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We laughed . Darnell said , " If you 'd stay in bed on a Saturday morning instead of dragging everybody down here , you 'd have a baby . " Dawn countered , " If you 'd come to bed instead of typing on that damn computer all night , you 'd be a father by now . " Samantha said , " I 'm all against the wall and worn out . I used to be able to play hours on end . I must be getting old . " Dawn smiled . " We used to close out every party we went to . " I said , " I know that 's right . Party all night , hit Fatburgers , then make it home just in time to go to church . " Samantha laughed . " Is this what being thirty does to you ? " Dawn asked , " You have any kids , Samantha ? " " Thirty with no babies . " " Just like me and Darnell . I 'm damn near thirty-two and no heirs . If I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that high-risk category , and that wo n't be cool . Not at all . " Darnell sighed . " Do n't depress Samantha , sweetheart . " I was picking up bits of chastisement from my friends , but Samantha did n't know them well enough to know that Dawn was dead serious . Samantha laughed . " I 'm cool . That 's why I stopped my biological clock at twenty-five . I 'm in no hurry to give up my freedom . " As she was talking , Dawn went after her husband . Darnell scooted away from her . She slid after him and started tickling him . Darnell 's damn ticklish . She climbed on top of him and kissed his face . Even though they fought , they had years of something that I envied . Samantha was watching them , smiling , then looking at me . Her eyes were gleaming for affection . Six months ago I met her on Pico at Roscoe 's Chicken ' n Waffles . The place was crowded ; both of us were alone ; our eyes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she wanted to share a table . She smiled , said sure , we did , and we talked nonstop . That communication drew me to her . Very articulate , well read , up on all the political activities in the neighborhood . Neither of us wanted to end the conversation . More like she did n't want to stop talking . Women always make it easy for a brotha . All that crap about running your mouth and macking harder than Max Julien ai n't the move . The secret of conversation is to get a woman to talk , then listen and absorb . They 'll tell you who did ' em wrong , what they want , raise their eyes to yours in a soft and tender way that asks if you can meet those demands . All a brotha has to do is pay attention , nod his head a time or two and , when she 's through , let her know that whatever the last man did , he 'd never do that . Minutes later me and Darnell were in the locker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower . A couple of other guys , one white and the other Asian , were in there too , but they were n't talking much . I rinsed the liquid soap off my body and stood underneath the waterfall of cool and cleansing water . I asked , " When you gon na have some more of that story for me to read ? " " The next day or so . I 'm only getting to write a paragraph here and there because work has had me tied down . And the moment I get home , Dawn starts whining for attention . " " Women will suck the life out of you . " " I know that 's right . Giving a woman the attention she wants is another full-time job . But work is taking up most of my time . I 'm getting ready for a hearing against Northwest out in Palm Springs . Plus I 'm doing some unlawful detainers for a friend of a friend who 's trying to evict some tenants out in Rialto . The tenants have n't paid a dime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wear yourself out . Finish that book . That could be a million dollars you sitting on . " Darnell smiled at my encouragement , then asked , " You talked to Jake ? " I said , " Yeah . " Jake is another one of our running buddies . He 's a fireman out in L.A. , near my folks ' house . That was when I remembered and told Darnell about the ski trip . On Valentine 's Day Jake and his fiance are hitting the local slopes and had extended an invitation for all of us to tag along . I would 've told Darnell sooner , but I did n't want to bring it up in front of Samantha . If I was kicking it with her this weekend , I 'd have to kick it with Toyomi next weekend . But if I finally catch up with Brittany , never know what I might do . Darnell said they had plans for Valentine 's Day . He was taking Dawn an hour across the Pacific Ocean to experience a few golden sunsets at Catalina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and back , the five-star hotel room and champagne brunch , were already hooked up . He asked , " Jake tell you those dreams were back ? " I let some water run over my face , into my mouth , then spat it out . I did n't want to get into talking about Jake 's dreams . They were too eerie , so demented it made my flesh crawl just thinking about them . I changed the subject , asked what him and Dawn were getting into today . Darnell replied , " We 're going to catch a couple of movies at the AMC on Fullerton Road . What you doing ? " I turned my shower off , grabbed my green towel . " Trying to get rid of Samantha . " He laughed a bit . I shook my head , said , " When she comes out here , it 's hard to get her ass to go back home . " " That girl likes you , that 's all . " " I like her too . " " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how will you ever know if that relationship has potential ? You have to focus on one . They start to cancel each other after a while . " I ignored his calm expression of righteousness . " I know she 's going to try and stay until Sunday night or early Monday morning , so I 'll tell her I 'm going up to see my momma . That way I can just follow her home , then bounce over to see my folks before I come back out this way . " Darnell chuckled . I said , " What 's funny ? " " You got your game laid out . You 've got a backup plan for your backup plan . If I had your hand , I 'd throw mine in . " I laughed . " If you got Dawn , you 've got the best hand . " " Grass is always greener . " I said , " Not when you 're taking care of your own lawn . " " With all the lawns you 're tending to with that weedwacker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed and finished drying off . After I got dressed I used the pay phone hidden in the locker room to make a few phone calls . Had to check a few traps . It took me twenty minutes to get Toyomi to cool off , but when I told her about the ski trip for Valentine 's Day , everything smoothed out . Pretty much . She was still filled with disappointment . She 'd get over it as soon as she saw me . We stopped by Mimi 's restaurant in Industry for coffee and lunch . Two hours after that I was following Samantha up the 10 freeway into the heart of Los Angeles . We dropped her car off , then rode deeper into territory that owned cool breeze after cool breeze . She wore shades she 'd bought in Venice Beach for five bucks , a leather backpack-style purse , sandals , no bra , a Bob Marley T-shirt over a short red dress , no panties . We hung out on the promenade in Santa Monica , drove the coast north toward Malibu . Rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex in the car . Samantha was moving her backside round and round , up and down , right on Pacific Coast Highway , with traffic whizzing by . We ate seafood dinners at Gladstone 's . Walked out into the darkness and let the sand rise up in between our toes . Back at her place , we oiled each other down , massaged each other while the soulful voice of Rachelle Ferrell lulled us . As I slept , I drifted back to my childhood . Smelled Daddy 's cologne . His cigar . Heard a dollar 's worth of lies jingling . Felt that chill again . Sorta missed my old man . Sorta . Wondered if there was a heaven for him .  - -  From Cheaters , by Eric Jerome Dickey . June , 1999 , Eric Jerome Dickey used by permission .
