AUGUST 29 ABSAROKA NATIONAL FOREST , WYOMING Bright had been trailing the black Suburban for nearly thirty miles , ever since it had left the gun shop in Sheridan , something called Mighty Malcolm 's Arsenal and Ordnance . August was nearly gone , now , but there 'd been a boldly lettered sign still hanging in one of the shop 's barred windows , red , white , and blue : HAVE A BLAST ON THE 4TH OF JULYALL HANDGUNS DISCOUNTED . Patriotism , Bright thought . Always a useful concept . Take those proclamations pasted to the bumper of the big vehicle up ahead . TAKE MY GUN , KISS MY BUTT . THE NRA 'S FOR CANDYASSES . And another sticker featuring a rendering of a fist with the middle finger extended , which Bright was n't close enough to read . An actual hand appeared briefly at one of the passenger windows of the Suburban , and a can sailed back in the slipstream , jouncing onto the pavement . Bright felt it pop under his own wheels . He 'd seen perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd turned off 1-90 onto the state highway several miles back , had passed through two wide spots in the road known as Ranchester and Dayton , then turned northward again just shy of a flyspeck called Burgess Junction . They were deep in the heart of the Bighorn wilderness , now , on a winding , ever-climbing , two-lane blacktop that would give out to gravel before long , somewhere above 9,000 feet , somewhere in a vast spread of peaks and pine near the Montana line , population per square mile steady at zero . Bright , having spent far too much of his adult life in human ant piles , the past several months in Hong Kong , the most recent in New York , found the prospect pleasing . There had been an exotic game ranch up there once , a fact he had learned in the course of his considerable research . The Roosevelt Preserve , named with unabashed irony , it had sprawled across the shoulders of Black Mountain , the most formidable of those angry-looking peaks and one that had been sacred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Lakota once had hunted the area , too , but they had taken only what they needed for survival and had offered up apologies to their gods each time an animal had fallen . Things had changed , of course . The Lakota long since slaughtered , the few survivors displaced . For a time , their sacred mountain had become a place where world-class high rollers had come to stalk ibex , gazelle , bison , bighorn sheep . Were one to pay enough , Bright mused , one might have shot oneself a rhino up there , chased after a snow leopard with an automatic weapon , tracked down some bewildered elephant too old for the circus or stolen from some zoo , finished it off with a bazooka or a Sidewinder missile , whatever turned the hunter in oneself on . The ranch had finally gone under , but there was talk of what storybook creatures had escaped or been left behind and were still roaming that far-flung wilderness . All of them fair game , free game , now , for the intrepid hunter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that traveling the lonely road just ahead . Time to bring that party back to its senses , Bright thought . Time to remind them how careless men can be . He nudged the accelerator of the big Ford Expedition , brought his window down , and reached to place the magnetic lamp onto the roof . It was n't actually a policeman 's light , of course , just as the uniform and the siren belonged to no jurisdiction , but they would help him get the job done . At first , the Suburban ignored the flashing blue light , but Bright had expected that . He nicked the siren a couple of times , then held it , its unearthly squawks and whoops doubling and redoubling off the deep canyon walls . Another mile , and the Suburban finally slowed , then bumped down grudgingly onto a turnout a hundred feet or so above the stream that sawed with timeless patience at the canyon floor below . Bright had turned off the siren but allowed the flasher to continue its whirl as he got out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck at him . The better part of two miles up , but it was ovenish hot , as close and as hot here , it seemed , as it had been on the plains below . What kind of hunting weather was it , anyway ? " Some kind of problem ? " It was a burly man who addressed him , the driver of the Suburban stepping down onto the gravel , so quiet Bright could hear the crunch beneath the man 's spit-polished boots . Five-eleven , maybe six feet , a close-shaved head the shape of a concrete block , no discernible neck . With a massive chest above a formidable gut , he went perhaps 240 , and Bright , himself six-two , his 200 pounds easily concealed in the loose uniform he wore , knew what it would feel like to hit him . " Please take your hands out of your pockets , " Bright told him evenly . The man glanced down , then back inside the open compartment of the Suburban , rolling his eyes . Bright heard something spoken inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them altogether : one standing by the road in front of him , three hidden behind the smoked windows of the Suburban . Convinced he 'd taken enough time to make his point , the driver took his hands out of his fatigue-fashioned pants and opened his palms to Bright . " You worried I was gon na shoot you ? " the man said . He offered a smile that came across as a leer . Bright 's own expression was neutral . " I 'd like to have the others out of the truck , " he told the man . " What the hell 's this about ? " the driver said , taking a step toward him . Bright did n't back away , simply held up his hand . Something in the gesture must have communicated itself to the man . He gave Bright an exasperated glance , then turned to the open doorway . " He wants you to get out , " the man called . A chorus of groans and muffled curses . The door nearest Bright swung open , and a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair got out , kicking a beer can onto the gravel . Hamm 's , Bright noted . From the land of sky-blue waters . They were driving a $40,000 vehicle , drinking special-of-the-week beer . Possibly it appealed to their proletarian instincts . The tall man looked at Bright . " He ai n't been drinkin ' , " he said , jerking his thumb at the driver . Bright nodded , as if it mattered . Then two others , the first a younger-looking , pseudomilitary version of the driver , and the secondsomething of a surprise to Brighta stocky , light-skinned black man in jeans and a T-shirt , emerged around the back of the Suburban . " What kind of cop are you ? " the younger man said , and Bright assumed from his voice that he was the driver 's son . And a fair question , Bright thought . His vehicle was unmarked , his uniform , such as it was , unadorned . Pale green canvas trousers , a matching shirt , a badge that seemed vaguely official in its shape but offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bright said . " I noticed your erratic driving . " " And I 'm a Chinese aviator , " the young one said . He glanced at his father . " This is n't any traffic cop . " " Take it easy , Simms , " his father said . " You mind if I just have a look in the back ? " Bright said . Unnecessary , really . He 'd had a look while the group had shopped at Mighty Malcolm 's . They 'd brought along everything he was interested in already . Whatever they had added there would be a bonus . " You got a warrant ? " This from the tall man , an unlikely-looking litigant . " That why you stopped us , to have a look in the back ? " the driver said . He affected calm , but there was new color flushing that close-cut scalp . The black man had been staring closely at him . Bright noticed that the man 's nose was unnaturally flattened , that a fine crosshatching of scars thickened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing with this crew of self-appointed militia . Take enough punches , your natural enemies might seem to be allies . " This fellow is a long way from home , " the black man said abruptly . There was something forlorn , something resigned , in the way he said it . Or perhaps it was just the shadow of the great mountain that sobered him . Either way , Bright thought , he 'd sensed the truth of what was about to happen . " Yeah , well , let me just get my license , Officer , " the driver said , turning toward the cab of the Suburban . The black man also had turned , and was heading around the corner of the Suburban when Bright withdrew the pistol from the holster at his belt . The first shot took the black man in the back , just beneath his left shoulder blade . He staggered forward , spine bowed as if he 'd been kicked , then pitched over the side of the canyon . The driver was turning with a pistol upraised when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward into the cab of the Suburban , squeezing off a round that blew through the roof with a whang . The roar of the unsilenced shot echoed again and again off the narrow canyon walls . Meantime , the driver 's younger double was bent over , scrabbling for a pistol sheathed in an ankle holster . Bright shot him squarely in the top of his shaven scalp , and the young man fell back into a sitting position , his head lolling against the side of the Suburban as if he had had just too much beer and hot sun to bear . The tall man had bolted around the back of the truck with an agility that seemed surprising for his awkward stature . Bright knew he 'd be going for something inside the vehicle . Instead of pursuing the man , he stepped over the inert form of the young man before him and slid into the backseat , just as the opposite door was swinging open . Bright kicked hard , heard the surprised grunt from the other side of the door . The man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bright 's kick was all it took . The tall man flew backward , lost his grip on the door handle , and sailed out into space , his arms windmilling . Bright caught a glimpse of his surprised face , was on through the passenger compartment in time to see the man land on the rocks below , his hands upflung in permanent surrender . All done , well done , Bright found himself thinking . Then felt something grip his ankle , felt his foot fly from under him . Stunned , he caught a glimpse of the face of the black mall as he went down hard on his back . Bright felt his breath fly from him , felt his hand bang against the side of the Suburban , heard his pistol clatter away in the gravel . The black man , his face twisted up in pain , was pulling himself up over the lip of the cliff , now , his gaze on the pistol , which had come to rest a few feet away . There was no question who would reach it first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon , saw the look of satisfaction on his face as he swung it toward him . Still gasping , Bright swept his hand through a skiff of gravel , stinging the man 's face and raising a cloud of dust between them . The black man cursed , and squeezed the trigger . Bright heard the familiar chuff of his own pistol , then a great , odd sigh from behind him , the sound of one of the Suburban 's huge tires deflating in an instant . The black man was wiping the grit from his eyes with one hand , steadying himself for a second shot , when Bright braced himself against the flattened wheel and drove his heel against the man 's forehead . The man tottered , but clearly he had taken harder shots . He was bringing the pistol down once more when Bright kicked him again , this time high on the chest , where a bright stain had blossomed on his shirt . The man groaned and fell backward , one hand clutching at his wound , the other locking on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in the chest , then a third time , but though the man 's eyes dimmed in pain , his grip on Bright 's leg held firm . Bright slung one arm backward , clawing for a hold on the deflated tire with one hand , reaching for his belt with the other . His feet were sliding in the loose gravel , struggling for purchase like dream appendages . He yanked hard at the clasp of his belt , tore at the fastener of his waistband , his zipper . He rolled onto his back , forced his shoulders hard against the wheel of the Suburban , kicked once more , this time giving it everything . He arched his hips off the ground with his follow-through , felt the cloth of his pants peel down his legs in an instant , felt weightlessness for a moment , then heard the man 's cry as he sailed off into space . Bright 's trousers were still clutched in his hand , flapping above him like some faulty parachute . A tree limb jutting from the cliff tore the fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over end , toward the stream below . Had it been a true river , the man might have had a chance . Instead , he went head-down into water that might have been a foot deep , the apotheosis of a Do Not Dive Here warning . The crack rose to Bright as if two great stones had been clapped together . Bright got to his feet , breathing heavily , and stared down at the crumpled figures below . After a moment , he retrieved his pistol , then went around to the other side of the Suburban to be certain there were no more surprises waiting . The canyon had regained its former quiet . Heat waves shimmered above the mute asphalt road . No hum of sixteen-inch tires , no clack of cans tumbling toward the steep shoulders , no raucous , steel-edged laughter . Bright smelled the tang of pine in the still air . A pair of jays swooped overhead , their cries a harsh counterpoint to an otherwise peaceful scene . The man who had been driving the Suburban lay half in , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . The one Bright had taken for the driver 's son still sat upright against the side of the truck , his porcine eyes bloodshot and protruding , a bottle fly making its way down the bridge of his nose , where a trickle of scarlet had dried . Bright glanced at his watch , checked the angle of the sun , let his breath out in a sigh . He would have to find a way down that cliff and scale it again , would have to change a sizable tire , and so much else . It was his own fault , of course . The matter could have been handled simply , with far less risk . But he had allowed himself an inexcusable breach of caution , given his line of endeavor and his considerable experience . Was boredom to account for it ? Some lapse attributable to such thin air ? He might be getting too old for this line of work , he thought . Perhaps he would have to start picking his jobs with more care . He glanced out over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the distant line of peaks . Maybe it was the mountain , he thought , maybe some lodestone deep inside its mass , some essence that tugged at the workings of any man 's inner compass . The Lakota had died , but not because they were stupid about such things . He opened his hands to the mountain , bowed his head briefly . He had no idea if the Lakota had behaved that way , but he offered up his apology anyway . This is what I must do . And then he turned to regard the men on the ground beside him and shook his head , driving superstition from his mind . They had died , he had not . He would not be so careless again . He had accomplished what he 'd set out to do , and he could go on to the next step of the plan , now . He bent down to pry the pistol from the hand of the man who 'd been driving the Suburban , removed its clip , jacked the remaining round from the chamber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back of the vehicle , when he thought of something . It took him a momentit was always difficult undressing a corpsebut it turned out that the pants fit perfectly . He tucked in his shirt , then glanced down at the man who had been so fond of his weapons . Bright bent down , applied his lips to the tips of his fingers , and tapped the rigid buttocks of the driver . Acknowledge the spirit of your victim , was that not the Lakota way ? " Take my gun , kiss my butt . " Bright nodded . He had his equipment , now ; he had the bodies of the men upon whom everything would one day be blamed . All that remained , then , was the work itself . So he rose and began to do it .
