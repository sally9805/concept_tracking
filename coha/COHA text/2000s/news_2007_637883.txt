<p> Year Three of Mike Nolan 's tenure as 49ers coach differs noticeably from the previous two in that he has the players to make his expectations possible . This is the year aphorisms give way to hard-won results . <p> " We have every right to expect that , " he said . <p> From 4-12 in 2005 to 7-9 in 2006 to a spot in the playoffs is what Nolan expects of the 49ers in 2007 , based on how the team finished off last season and how it methodically approached an offseason of free agency , the draft , minicamps and what are called organized team activities  --  which is football for weightlifting , drills and meetings to discuss what happened in the last meeting . <p> " Hopefully , each year it gets better and better , " Nolan said in advance of the start of training camp at the team 's Santa Clara headquarters . " I would hope next year it 'd be better than this year . ... Players every year go in with that goal in mind . To all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pressure on us to accomplish it . I 'd rather have that pressure . " <p> Toward that end , the 49ers appear set at most positions , although training camp will offer a few compelling struggles for starting jobs . Making the team after the last cuts of summer will be more difficult for fringe players than at any time in Nolan 's tenure in San Francisco . <p> The 49ers will open training camp a week from today with 84 players , four of them named Zac , Zak , Zach and Zachary . However , the really important names are Alex , Frank , Vernon , Nate , Jim and Greg . <p> Quarterback Alex Smith returns for his third year , still bearing the promise of greatness along with the knowledge that he improved greatly as a sophomore in 2006 . <p> " I expect him to keep getting better , " Nolan said . " I will be disappointed if he does n't have a better year ( than ' 06 ) . Alex is real steady and consistent . He 's not a hot-and-cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He works hard , he 's extremely intelligent and he 's tough as hell . " <p> It 's running back Frank Gore 's third year , as well , and what can he possibly do to top a 2006 season in which he established franchise records for rushing yards ( 1,695 ) and total yards ( 2,180 ) in a humble style that endeared him to his teammates , particularly the offensive linemen ? <p> Keeping an offense in which most starting positions are set going into camp percolating is the responsibility of new coordinator Jim Hostler , who was Smith 's quarterbacks coach the last two years . <p> Making the transition easier is the fact Hostler will keep the same system and terminology that Norv Turner used as coordinator last year before he left for San Diego to become the Chargers ' head coach . <p> One of Hostler 's projects should be getting a full and productive season out of second-year tight end Vernon Davis , last year 's top draft pick . He was limited to 10 games because of a broken bone in his leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor with his unreal speed for a tight end . <p> The first time Davis touched the ball in an NFL game was in the season opener at Arizona when he got behind the Cardinals ' defense on a touchdown catch . He needs to be a big part of the offense this season . <p> Newcomers Nate Clements and Tully Banta-Cain face a similar responsibility on defense , now run by coordinator Greg Manusky . Clements , a cornerback with impressive credentials and an $82 million contract , was the crown jewel of the free-agency period . He will start opposite understated veteran Walt Harris at the other corner in a revamped secondary that also includes free-agent acquisition Michael Lewis at strong safety . <p> Banta-Cain , the former New England Patriot , is a key component in the 49ers ' switch to a 3-4 defense . He 'll be at one outside linebacker spot opposite second-year man Manny Lawson , with holdovers Derek Smith and Brandon Moore inside . Top draft pick Patrick Willis will start out as a linebacker in the team 's third-down defense . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nolan said . " We have n't changed the terminology . For most of our guys , it will be the third year with the same language . " <p> Banta-Cain , the former Cal Golden Bear , appealed to Nolan as much for his pedigree as one of Bill Belichick 's Patriots as for his playing ability . <p> " He comes from a good , strong defense , " Nolan said . " He knows how to play in-season games and postseason games . He 's certainly an upgrade to us . " <p> Banta-Cain , Clements , Lewis and wide receiver Darrell Jackson are players who come to the 49ers in their late-20s  --  seemingly in the prime of their football careers . Not counting kicker Joe Nedney , the 49ers have only four starters 32 or older on the roster . <p> If that does n't mean success in the here and now , it certainly bodes well for a future just around the corner . <p> Santa Clara camp <p> Where : 4949 Centennial Blvd. , Santa Clara <p> When : July 29-Aug. 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to the public  --  July 30 , 4 p.m. ; Aug. 1 , 4 p.m. ; Aug. 3 , 4 p.m. ; Aug. 4 , 3 p.m. ; Aug. 6 , 4 p.m. ; Aug. 8 , 4 p.m. ; Aug. 10 , 4 p.m. ; Aug. 20 , 4 p.m .
