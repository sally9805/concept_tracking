MR . RABBIT VISITS BARCELONA Within the intelligence services of the Indo-European Alliance , there were a handful of bureaucratic superstars , people such as Gnberk Braun of the EUIB . Hopefully , their identities were unknown -- or a mass of contradictions -- to the general public . The superstars had their own heroes . In particular , when people like Gnberk Braun were confronted with the most desperate problems , there was a place to get help . There was a certain department in India 's External Intelligence Agency . It did n't show up in EIA organization charts , and its purpose was happily undefined . Basically , it was whatever its boss thought it should be . That boss was an Indian national known ( to those very few who knew of him at all ) as Alfred Vaz . Braun took his terrifying discovery to Vaz . At first , the older man was as taken aback as Braun himself had been . But Vaz was a fixer . " With the proper human resources , you can solve almost any problem , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I can dig up . " In downtown Barcelona , three days later : The rabbit hopped onto the unoccupied wicker chair and thence to the middle of the table , between the teacups and the condiments . It tipped its top hat first at Alfred Vaz and then at Gnberk Braun and KeikoMitsuri . " Have I got a deal for you ! " it said . Altogether , it was an unremarkable example of its type . Alfred reached out and swiped his hand through the image , just to emphasize his own substance . " We 're the ones with the deal . " " Hmph . " The rabbit plunked its ass down on the table and pulled a tiny tea service out from behind the salt and pepper . It poured itself a drop or two -- enough to fill its cup -- and took a sip . " I 'm all ears . " It wiggled two long ones to emphasize the point . From the other side of the table , Gnberk Braun gave the creature a long stare . Braun was as ephemeral as the rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent with his real personality . Alfred thought he detected a certain surprised disappointment in the younger man 's expression . In fact , after a moment , Gnberk sent him a silent message . Braun  - -  &gt; Mitsuri , Vaz : &lt;sm&gt;This is the best you could recruit , Alfred ? &lt;/sm&gt; Alfred did n't reply directly . Instead , he turned to the creature sitting on the table . " Welcome to Barcelona , Mr. Rabbit , " he said . He waved at the towers of the Sagrada Familia , which soared up and up from just across the street . The cathedral was best seen without virtual elaboration ; after all , the reality of Gaud architecture was gaudy beyond the imagination of modern revisionists . " Do you have any idea why we selected this location for our meeting ? " The rabbit sipped its tea . Its gaze slid in a very un-rabbity way to take in the noisy crowds that swept past the tables , to scan the costumes and body-plans of tourists and locals . " Ah , is it that Barcelona is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few great cities of the twentieth century whose charm survives in the modern world ? Could it be that on the side , you and your families are taking touchy-feely tours through Parc Gell and writing it all off on your expense accounts ? " He stared at Braun and at Keiko Mitsuri . Mitsuri was frankly masked . She looked a bit like Marcel Duchamp 's nude , built from a shifting complex of crystal planes . The rabbit shrugged . " But then again , maybe you two are thousands of kilometers away . " Keiko laughed . " Oh , do n't be so indecisive , " she said , speaking with a completely synthetic accent and syntax . " I 'm quite happy to be in Parc Gell right now , feeling reality with my very own real hands . " Mitsuri  - -  &gt; Braun , Vaz : &lt;sm&gt;In fact , I 'm in my office , admiring the moonlight on Tokyo Bay . &lt;/sm&gt; The rabbit continued , ignorant of the silent-messaging byplay : " Whatever . In any case , the real reasons for meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're really from , and modern security to disguise what we say . Best of all , it has laws banning popular and police snooping . . . unless of course you are the EU Intelligence Board . " Mitsuri  - -  &gt; Braun , Vaz : &lt;sm&gt;Well , that 's one-third of a correct guess . &lt;/sm&gt; Braun  - -  &gt; Mitsuri , Vaz : &lt;sm&gt;Mr . Rabbit himself is calling from some distance . &lt;/sm&gt; An EU real-time estimate hung in the air above the little creature 's head : seventy-five percent probability that the mind behind the rabbit image was in North America . Alfred leaned toward the rabbit and smiled . As the agent with physical presence , Vaz had limitations -- but some advantages , too . " No , we 're not the secret police . And yes , we wanted some secure communication that was a bit more personal than text messaging . " He tapped his chest . " In particular , you see me physically here . It builds trust . " And should give you all sorts of invalid clues . Vaz waved to a waiter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the creature on the tablecloth : " In recent months , you have bragged many things , Mr. Rabbit . Others brag similarly nowadays , but you have certificates that are difficult to come by . Various people with notable reputations have endorsed your abilities . " The rabbit preened . This was a rabbit with many implausible mannerisms . Physical realism did not rank high in its priorities . " Of course I am highly recommended . For any problem , political , military , scientific , artistic , or amorous -- meet my terms , and I will deliver . " Mitsuri  - -  &gt; Braun , Vaz : &lt;sm&gt;Go ahead , Alfred . &lt;/sm&gt; Braun  - -  &gt; Mitsuri , Vaz : &lt;sm&gt;Yes , the minimal version of course . Nothing more till we see some results that we could n't make for ourselves . &lt;/sm&gt; Alfred nodded as if to himself . " Our problem has nothing to do with politics or war , Mr. Rabbit . We have only some scientific interests . " The rabbit ears waggled . " So ? Post your needs to the answer boards . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as fast . And for certain , a thousand times cheaper . " Wine arrived . Vaz made a thing of sniffing the bouquet . He glanced across the street . The bidding on physical tour slots to the Sagrada Familia was closed for the day , but there was still a queue of people near the cathedral entrance , people hoping for no-shows . It proved once again that the most important things were those you could touch . He looked back at the gray rabbit . " We have needs that are more basic than picking the brains of a few thousand analysts . Our questions require serious , um , experimentation . Some of that has already been done . Much remains . All together , our project is the size you might imagine for a government crash research program . " The rabbit grinned , revealing ivory incisors . " Heh . A government crash program ? That 's twentieth-century foolishness . Market demands are always more effective . You just have to fool the market into cooperating . " " Maybe . But what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it was , even the cover story was extreme . " What we want is , um , administrative authority at a large physical laboratory . " The rabbit froze , and for an instant it looked like a real herbivore , one suddenly caught in a bright light . " Oh ? What kind of physical lab ? " " Globally integrated life sciences . " " Well , well , well . " Rabbit sat back , communing with itself -- hopefully with itself alone . EU Intelligence set a sixty-five percent probability that Rabbit was not sharing the big picture with others , ninety-five percent that it was not a tool of China or the U.S.A. Alfred 's own organization in India was even more confident of these assumptions . The rabbit set down his teacup . " I 'm intrigued . So this is not an information-provision job . You really want me to subvert a major installation . " " Just for a short time , " said Gnberk . " Whatever . You 've come to the right fellow . " Its nose quivered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are a scattering of top institutions , but none is totally integrated -- and for now they remain in the backwash of sites in China and the U.S.A. " Vaz did n't nod , but the rabbit was right . There were brilliant researchers the world over , but only a few data-intensive labs . In the twentieth century , technical superiority of major labs might last thirty years . Nowadays , things changed faster , but Europe was a little behind . The Bhopal complex in India was more integrated , but lagging in micro-automation . It might be several years before China and the U.S.A. lost their current edge . The rabbit was chuckling to itself : " Hm , hm . So it must be either the labs in Wuhan or those in Southern California . I could work my miracles with either , of course . " That was a lie , or else Alfred 's people had totally misjudged this fine furry friend . Keiko said , " We 'd prefer the biotech complex in San Diego , California . " Alfred had a smooth explanation ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some months . We know they have the resources we need . " In fact , San Diego was where Gnberk Braun 's terrible suspicions were focused . " Just what are you planning ? " Gnberk gave a sour smile . " Let us proceed by installments , Mr. Rabbit . For the first installment , we suggest a thirty-day deadline . We 'd like from you a survey of the San Diego labs ' security . More important , we need credible evidence that you can provide a team of local people to carry out physical acts in and near those labs . " " Well then . I will hop right on it . " The rabbit rolled its eyes . " It 's obvious you 're looking for an expendable player , somebody to shield your operation from the Americans . Okay . I can be a cutout . But be warned . I am very pricey and I will be around to collect afterwards . " Keiko laughed . " No need to be melodramatic , Mr. Rabbit . We know of your famous skills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe in them . Now I 'll go away , sniff around San Diego , and get back to you in a couple of weeks . I 'll have something to show you by then , and -- more important for me -- I 'll have used my enormous imagination to specify a first payment in this installment plan that Mr. So-German-Seeming has proposed . " He gave a little bow in Gnberk 's direction . Mitsuri and Braun were radiating bemused silence , so it was Alfred who carried on the conversation . " We 'll chat again then . Please remember that for now we want a survey only . We want to know whom you can recruit and how you might use them . " The rabbit touched its nose . " I will be the soul of discretion . I always know much more than I reveal . But you three really should improve your performances . Mr. So-German is just an out-of-date stereotype . And you , seora , the work of impressionist art reveals nothing and everything . Who might have a special interest in the San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rabbit looked at Vaz . " That 's a fine Colombian accent you 're hiding . " The creature laughed and hopped off the table . " Talk to you soon . " Alfred leaned back and watched the gray form as it dodged between the legs of passersby . It must have a festival permit , since other people were evidently seeing the creature . There was no poof of vanishment . The rabbit remained visible for twenty meters up Carrer de Sardenya , then darted into an alley and was finally and quite naturally lost to sight . The three agents sat for a moment in apparently companionable silence , Gnberk bent over his virtual wine , Vaz sipping at his real Rioja and admiring the stilted puppets that were setting up for the afternoon parade . The three blended well with the normal touristy hurly-burly of the Familia district -- except that most tourists paying for caf seating on C. de Sardenya would have had more than a one-third physical presence . " He is truly gone , " Gnberk said , a bit unnecessarily ; they could all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed . The Japanese and Indian intelligence agencies also reported in : Rabbit remained unidentified . " Well that 's something , " said Keiko . " He got away clean . Perhaps he can function as a cutout . " Gnberk gave a weary shrug . " Perhaps . What a disgusting twit . His kind of dilettante is a clich a century old , reborn with each new technology . I wager he 's fourteen years old and desperately eager to show off . " He glanced at Vaz . " Is this the best you could come up with , Alfred ? " " His reputation is not a fraud , Gnberk . He has managed projects almost as complex as what we have in mind for him . " " Those were research projects . Perhaps he is a good -- what 's the term ?  - -  'weaver of geniuses . ' What we want is more operational . " " Well , he correctly picked up on all of the clues we gave him . " There had been Alfred 's accent , and the network evidence they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Gnberk , and a sudden smile crossed his face . " It 's a bit humiliating that when I am simply myself , I 'm accused of overacting ! Yes , so now Mr. Rabbit thinks we are South American drug lords . " The shifting crystal mists that were Keiko 's image seemed to smile . " In a way , that 's more plausible than what we really are . " The heirs of drug wars past had been in eclipse this last decade ; access to " ecstasy and enhancement " was so widespread that competition had done what enforcement could never accomplish . But the drug lords were still rich beyond the dreams of most small countries . The ones lurking in failed states might be crazy enough to do what they three had hinted at today . Gnberk said , " The rabbit is manageable , I grant that . Competent for our needs ? Much less likely . " " Having second thoughts about our little project , Gnberk ? " This was Keiko 's real voice . Her tone was light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course , " said Gnberk . He fidgeted for a moment . " Look . Terror via technical surprise is the greatest threat to the survival of the human race . The Great Powers -- ourselves , China , the U.S. -- have been at peace for some years , mostly because we recognize that danger and we keep the rest of the world in line . And now we discover that the Americans --  " Keiko : " We do n't know it 's the Americans , Gnberk . The San Diego labs support researchers all over the world . " " That is so . And a week ago I was as dubious as you . But now . . . consider : The weapons test was a masterpiece of cloaking . We were incredibly lucky to notice it . The test was a work of patience and professionalism , at the level of a Great Power . Great Powers have their own inertia and bureaucratic caution . Field testing must necessarily be done in the outside world , but they do not run their weapons development in labs they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimes . " But why would a Great Power plot a revolution in plague delivery ? What profit is there in that ? " Gnberk nodded . " Yes , such destruction would make sense for a cult , but not for a superpower . At first , my conclusion was a nightmare without logic . But my analysts have been over this again and again . They 've concluded that the ' honeyed-nougat symptom ' was not simply a stand-in for lethal disease . In fact , it was an essential feature of the test . This enemy is aiming at something greater than instant biowarfare strikes . This enemy is close to having an effective YGBM technology . " Keiko was completely silent ; even her crystals lost their mobility . YGBM . That was a bit of science-fiction jargon from the turn of the century : You-Gotta-Believe-Me . That is , mind control . Weak , social forms of YGBM drove all human history . For more than a hundred years , the goal of irresistible persuasion had been a topic of academic study . For thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten , some version of it had been feasible in well-controlled laboratory settings . The crystals shifted ; Alfred could tell that Keiko was looking at him . " Can this be true , Alfred ? " " Yes , I 'm afraid so . My people have studied the report . Gnberk 's luck was extraordinary , since this was really a simultaneous test of two radical innovations . The honeyed-nougat compulsion was far more precise than needed for a test of remote disease triggering . The perpetrators knew what they were coding for -- consider the cloaking advertisement for nougats . My analysts think the enemy may be capable of higher semantic control in as little as a year . " Keiko sighed . " Damn . All my life , I 've fought the cults . I thought the great nations were beyond the most monstrous evils . . . but this , this would make me wrong . " Gnberk nodded . " If we are right about these labs and if we fail to properly . . . deal . . . with them , that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the striving for good against evil that has ever been . " He shook himself , abruptly returning to the practical . " And yet we are reduced to working through this damned rabbit person . " Alfred said gently , " I 've studied Rabbit 's track record , Gnberk . I think he can do what we need . One way or another . He 'll get us the inside information , or he 'll create enough chaos -- not attributable to us -- that any evil will be clearly visible . If the worst is true , we 'll have evidence that we and China and even the nonculpable parties in the U.S.A. can use to stamp this out . " Suppression attacks on the territory of a Great Power were rare , but there was precedent . All three were silent for a moment , and the sounds of the festival afternoon swept around Vaz . It had been so many years since his last visit to Barcelona . . . . Finally , Gnberk gave a grudging nod . " I 'll recommend to my superiors that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagery shimmered and chimed . Mitsuri 's background was in sociology . Her analyst teams were heavily into psychology and social institutions -- much less diversified than the teams working for Alfred , or Gnberk . But maybe she would come up with some alternative that the other two had missed . Finally she spoke : " There are many decent people in the American intelligence community . I do n't like doing this behind their back . And yet , this is an extraordinary situation . I have clearance to go ahead with Plan Rabbit --  " she paused " with one proviso . Gnberk fears that we 've erred in the direction of employing an incompetent . Alfred has studied Rabbit more , and thinks he 's at just the right level of talent . But what if you are both wrong ? " Gnberk started in surprise . " The devil ! " he said . Alfred guessed that some very quick silent messaging passed between the two . The prisms seemed to nod . " Yes . What if Rabbit is significantly more competent than we think ? In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even ally with our hypothetical enemy . If we proceed , we must develop abort-and-destroy plans to match Rabbit 's progress . If he becomes the greater threat , we must be prepared to talk to the Americans . Agreed ? " " Ja . " " Of course . " Keiko and Gnberk stayed a few minutes more , but a real caf table on C. de Sardenya in the middle of the festival was not the proper place for virtual tourists . The waiter kept circling back , inquiring if Alfred needed anything more . They were paying table rent for three , but there were crowds of real people waiting for the next available seating . So his Japanese and European colleagues took their leave . Gnberk had many loose ends to deal with . The inquiries at CDD must be gracefully shut down . Misinformation must be layered carefully about , concealing things both from the enemy and from security hobbyists . Meantime , in Tokyo , Keiko might be up the rest of the night , pondering Rabbit traps . Vaz stayed behind , finishing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrank , accommodating a family of North African tourists . Alfred was used to virtual artifacts changing in a blink of the eye , but a clever restaurateur could do almost as well with physical reality when there was money involved . In all Europe , Barcelona was the city Alfred loved the most . The Rabbit was right about this city . But was there time to be a real tourist ? Yes . Call it his annual vacation . Alfred stood and bowed to the table , leaving payment and tip . Out on the street , the crowds were getting rather extreme , the stilt people dancing wildly about among the tourists . He could n't see the entrance of the Sagrada Familia directly , but tourism info showed the next certain tour slot was ninety minutes away . Where to spend his time ? Ah ! Atop Montjuc . He turned down an alley . Where he emerged on the far side , the crowds were thin . . . and a tourist auto was just arriving for him . Alfred sat back in the single passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the most impressive in Europe , and yet he had not seen it in some time . Like its brethren , it marked the bygone time when revolutions in destruction technology took decades to unfold , and mass murder could not be committed with the press of a button . The auto navigated its way out from the octagonal city blocks of the Barcelona basin and ran quickly up a hillside , grabbing the latch of a funicular that dragged them swiftly up the side of Montjuc . No tedious switchback roadway for this piece of automation . Behind him , the city stretched for miles . And then ahead , as they came over the crest of the hill , there was the Mediterranean , all blue and hazy and peaceful . Alfred got out , and the tiny auto whipped around the traffic circle , heading for the cable-car installation that would take its next customer in an overflight across the harbor . He was at just the spot he had ordered on the tourist menu , right where twentieth-century guns faced out from the battlements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very much the real thing . For a fee , he could touch the guns and climb around inside the place . After sundown there would be a staged battle . Vaz strolled to the stone barrier and looked down . If he blocked out all the tourism fantasy , he could see the freight harbor almost two hundred meters below and a kilometer away . The place was an immensity of freight containers rambling this way and that , chaos . If he invoked his government powers , he could see the flow of cargo , even see the security certificates that proclaimed -- in ways that were validated by a combination of physical and cryptographic security -- that none of the ten-meter boxes contained a nuke or a plague or a garden-variety radiation bomb . The system was very good , the same as you would find for heavy freight anywhere in the civilized world . It had been the result of decades of fear , of changing attitudes about privacy and liberty , of technological progress . Modern security actually worked most of the time . There had n't been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the civilized world grew and the reach of lawlessness and poverty shrank . Many people thought that the world was becoming a safer place . Keiko and Gnberk -- and certainly Alfred -- knew that such optimism was dead wrong . Alfred looked across the harbor at the towers beyond . Those had n't been here the last time he visited Barcelona . The civilized world was wealthy beyond the dreams of his youth . Back in the 1980s and 1990s , the rulers of modern states realized that success did not come from having the largest armies or the most favorable tariffs or the most natural resources -- or even the most advanced industries . In the modern world , success came from having the largest possible educated population and providing those hundreds of millions of creative people with credible freedom . But this utopia was a Red Queen 's Race with extinction . In the twentieth century , only a couple of nations had the power to destroy the world . The human race survived , mostly by good luck . At the turn of the century , a time was in view when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Great Powers had a certain amount of good sense . No nation-state could be nuts enough to blow up the world -- and the few barbaric exceptions were Dealt With , if necessary with methods that left land aglow in the dark . By the teens , mass death technology was accessible to regional and racial hate groups . Through a succession of happy miracles -- some engineered by Alfred himself -- the legitimate grievances of disaffected peoples were truly addressed . Nowadays , Grand Terror technology was so cheap that cults and small criminal gangs could acquire it . That was where Keiko Mitsuri was the greatest expert . Even though her work was hidden by cover stories and planted lies , Keiko had saved millions of lives . The Red Queen 's Race continued . In all innocence , the marvelous creativity of humankind continued to generate unintended consequences . There were a dozen research trends that could ultimately put world-killer weapons into the hands of anyone having a bad hair day . Alfred walked back to the nearest cannon , paying the touch fee with a wave of his hand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue mediterranean haze , and imagining a simpler time . Poor Gnberk . He had the truth exactly backwards . Effective YGBM would not be the end of everything . In the right hands , YGBM technology was the one thing that could solve the modern paradox , harnessing the creativity of humankind without destroying the world in the process . In fact , it was humankind 's only hope for surviving the twenty-first century . And in San Diego , I am so close to success . He had insinuated his project into the bio labs three years earlier . The great breakthrough had come less than a year ago . His test at the soccer match had proven the delivery system . In another year or so , he 'd have developed higher semantic controls . With that , he could reliably control those immediately around him . Much more important , he could spread the new infection across whole populations and engineer a few universally viewed transmissions . Then he would be in control . For the first time in history , the world would be under adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad luck had jeopardized it . But I should look at the bright side ; Gnberk came to me to fix the problem ! Alfred had spent a lot of effort digging up " Mr. Rabbit . " The fellow was clearly inexperienced , and every bit the egotistical fool that Gnberk believed . Rabbit 's successes were just barely impressive enough to make him acceptable . They could manage Rabbit . I can manage Rabbit . From inside the labs , Alfred would feed the Rabbit just the right misinformation . In the end neither Rabbit nor Alfred 's colleagues in the Indo-European Alliance would realize they had been fooled . And afterward , Alfred could continue undisturbed with what might well be the last , best chance for saving the world . Alfred climbed into the gun turret and admired the fittings . The Barcelona tourist commission had spent some real money on rebuilding these artifacts . If their mock battle this evening meshed with this physical reality , it would be very impressive . He glanced at his Mumbai schedule -- and decided to stay in Barcelona a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
