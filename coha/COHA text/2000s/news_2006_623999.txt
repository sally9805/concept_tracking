<p> State Controller Steve Westly made a $286,000 profit at the height of the dot-com boom through a pattern of stock trades that experts say is consistent with participation in a banned stock-market manipulation scheme . <p> His tax returns show that on 33 occasions between April and October 1999 , Westly  --  then an executive at the online auction house eBay and today a Democratic candidate for governor  --  bought blocks of hot new dot-com stocks at the initial public offering price , a lucrative investment opportunity that underwriters steered to wealthy clients and other insiders . <p> Then , after the market opened and public trading began , Westly bought more of the same stocks  --  almost always an identical number of shares . He paid premium prices , sometimes as much as triple what he paid for the IPO . <p> A Westly spokesman said Westly did nothing improper , but several experts consulted by The Chronicle said Westly 's pattern of stock trading suggested " laddering , " a scheme in which investment banks pump up the price of a new stock by requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens for trading . <p> The insiders ' post-IPO purchases drive up the price , creating the illusion that the stock is in heavy demand . Ordinary investors , unaware of what is happening , often lose heavily after insiders start to sell and the stock price drops . <p> In all 33 cases , Westly sold the stocks soon after buying them , his tax returns show . He lost more than $71,000 on the shares he bought after the stocks were made available to the public . <p> But Westly 's losses on those trades were more than offset by the hefty profits he obtained by selling the shares he obtained via IPOs  --  returns of as much as 208 percent . Overall , he came out $286,000 ahead for holding stocks for only a few hours or days . <p> When The Chronicle sought to interview Westly about the stock trades , campaign manager Jude Barry said he would speak for Westly . <p> Barry said Westly was a hands-off investor who delegated most decisions to trusted brokers . Westly never participated in or authorized improper trading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a legal investment strategy , he said . <p> " This was a fairly small portion of his overall portfolio , and they were acting within the ground rules , " Barry said . <p> Securities and Exchange Commission regulations ban laddering as a form of investment fraud . Banks and issuers who violate the regulation are subject to fines . In enforcement actions , the SEC has never punished investors who participated in laddering schemes , the experts said . <p> To prove laddering , regulators must obtain evidence showing that brokers told investors that they would be cut in on IPOs only if they agreed to buy more shares after trading began , the experts said . <p> Barry said Westly made no such agreement . <p> The Chronicle described Westly 's stock trades to eight experts : four university professors who specialize in securities law , three lawyers who represent investors in securities fraud lawsuits , and one lawyer who has defended securities cases . <p> Six said Westly 's trades were consistent with laddering . A seventh , University of Michigan law Professor Adam Pritchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but declined to characterize them . The defense attorney said there could easily be an innocent explanation . <p> Columbia University law Professor John C. Coffee , an expert in securities fraud , said Westly 's trades in the stocks were " consistent with the pattern and phenomenon of laddering . " <p> A rational investor would not continue to make those money-losing second purchases of stock , he reasoned . " I do n't see another obvious explanation " except a laddering scheme , Coffee said . <p> Another securities expert to whom The Chronicle described Westly 's trades , Fordham University law Professor Steve Thel , said : " That 's exactly what laddering would look like if you saw somebody 's trading records . " <p> Rajneesh Aggarwal , a professor at the University of Minnesota 's Carlson School of Management , called Westly 's trades " the classic pattern " of laddering , and " exactly what we 've seen , in those cases that we know about . " <p> The defense lawyer , who asked not to be quoted by name out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases might simply reflect an investor playing for a single big score from a stock  --  someone hoping for the next Google , a stock that is trading at more than triple its 2004 opening price . <p> Some investors believe " you only need one home run , " and are willing to lose regularly in pursuit of it , the attorney said . <p> In all , Westly was cut in on 216 different IPOs during the dot-com boom , turning a profit of more than $1.5 million , the tax returns show . Of them , 107  --  including all 33 that the experts said were consistent with laddering  --  came from Robertson Stephens Inc. , a San Francisco investment bank that underwrote hundreds of stock issues during the dot-com era . It went out of business in 2002 . <p> Robertson Stephens is among 22 investment banks accused in class-action shareholders ' lawsuits of defrauding thousands of ordinary investors via laddering schemes and other forms of IPO fraud during the dot-com era . <p> " In order for certain Robertson Stephens customers to receive IPO share allocations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of that same issuer 's common stock in the aftermarket , " the lawsuits claim . <p> Brokers " would often denote the price that the customers would have to pay in the aftermarket , and these prices would escalate upward in a plan known as ' laddering , ' " the suits allege . The firm has denied wrongdoing . <p> The suits , which are awaiting trial in federal court in New York , also accused more than 400 dot-com-era companies of participating in laddering and other illegal schemes . In 2003 , 309 of the firms agreed to pay investors $1 billion to settle the suits . <p> Among the firms agreeing to settle were 22 companies in which Westly obtained IPOs and then made additional stock purchases via Robertson Stephens . <p> Westly is a former investment banker and San Jose city official who made a fortune of more than $200 million as eBay 's vice president for marketing . He was elected state controller in 2002 . <p> He made his tax returns available to reporters last year as part of his campaign for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil Angelides , has not yet released his returns . <p> Experts say laddering schemes have been deployed in every bull market since the 1920s . During the dot-com era , investment bankers often specified the number of shares an insider had to buy in the aftermarket to get in on a hot IPO , said Howard Sirota , a plaintiff 's lawyer in the combined class-action lawsuits in New York . <p> The victim of laddering , said Columbia professor Coffee , is the little guy . <p> " You are cheating the small retail investor who is buying in a market where the price is inflated , " he said . " The rug is going to be pulled out from under him relatively quickly , and he will suffer a real loss . " <p> One person who says he was a victim of laddering in the dot-com era is Carl K. Foote , the retired operator of a backhoe business in Bella Vista , near Redding ( Shasta County ) . Foote , a plaintiff in the combined class-action lawsuits in New York , invested in Paradyne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five days . <p> " After I first bought it , it went up so much it might have been to the point where I had a $1,000 profit , and then it went down the other way to nothing , " Foote said in a phone interview . " I should have got out when it started looking bad , but I just did n't have enough sense . " <p> He said his experience had convinced him that " the whole stock market is pretty well manipulated , but you do n't know how to get in on the manipulation . " <p> According to his tax returns , Westly got his first IPOs from Robertson Stephens at about the time the firm was hired as co-manager on a $1.6 billion offering of eBay stock . In the dot-com era , investment banks often steered IPOs to executives at companies that had given them underwriting business , experts said . <p> But Barry , Westly 's campaign manager , said Westly 's eBay connection had nothing to do with it . He said Westly was a Robertson Stephens client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westly 's friend and a former student at Stanford University 's business school . <p> Follis said he was solely responsible for Westly 's investment decisions . <p> " I have always followed the rules in making money for my clients , " Follis said , adding that Westly and his other clients " simply do not get involved in the level of detail where they analyze thousands of companies and trades . " <p> On April 8 , 1999 , the tax returns show Westly bought 300 shares of Extreme Networks , a Santa Clara maker of computer network technology , at the IPO price of $17 . Then Westly bought another 300 shares at $54 , the price at which the stock opened , according to data compiled on the finance.yahoo.com Web site . Six days later , Westly sold all 600 shares at a $48 price . He lost nearly $2,000 on the portion he bought after the stock opened , an analysis of the trades show , but he was ahead more than $9,200 on the IPO stock . His profit , after holding the stocks less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between then and Oct. 4 , Robertson Stephens steered IPOs to Westly , and in each case Westly purchased more shares in the aftermarket . He made his easiest money on July 16 , when he bought 1,500 shares of Paradyne Networks , a Florida firm that built Ethernet cards , at the IPO price of $17 . Then he bought 1,500 additional shares at $53.34 , near the first-day high . Five days later he sold all 3,000 shares for $52.40 . Again , Westly lost money on the shares he bought on the open market  --  $1,400 , in this case . But because he got a 208 percent gain on the IPO shares , he turned an overall profit of $51,698 , the returns reflect . <p> Westly also made out particularly well on Value America , an online department store that later went bankrupt ( $21,260 net after holding it five days ) , IXL Networks , a Georgia technology consulting firm ( $22,245 ) and Mypoints , a now-defunct online marketing service ( $17,340 ) . <p> Only when an IPO was particularly anemic did Westly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which provided online coverage of sporting events ( a $1,500 loss on 1,000 shares ) and JFAX , a firm that sought to provide fax service by e-mail ( a loss of $3,150 on 1,400 shares . ) Both firms have gone out of business . <p> The 33 IPO purchases put Westly ahead more than $358,000  --  more than $10,800 per trade . But the 33 post-IPO purchases set him back more than $71,000  --  more than $2,100 per trade . In the end , he profited by more than $286,000 . <p> Barry , Westly 's campaign manager , said making second purchases of IPO stock was a " standard operating procedure " of Westly 's broker , who sometimes made aftermarket purchases to obtain more of a hot stock . <p> When asked why Westly would continue to authorize the money-losing post-IPO stock purchases , Barry said the broker 's " overall performance was good . ... Steve was focused primarily on his overall performance and not individual trades . " <p> Federal records show that the SEC accused three big investment banks  --  Goldman Sachs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the dot-com era . All settled with multi-million dollar fines . <p> The SEC investigated allegations of laddering at Robertson Stephens , according to court records , but did not accuse it of laddering . Instead , the SEC sued Robertson Stephens for allegedly requiring investment firms to pay kickbacks in exchange for IPOs . Without admitting wrongdoing , Robertson Stephens paid a $28 million penalty and agreed not to engage in illegal conduct . <p> Westly 's tax returns reflect his rapid transformation from white-collar executive into mega-millionaire . In 1995 , the year he left municipal government for a business job , Westly reported income of $120,109 , including $73,270 from the city of San Jose . <p> Four years later , Westly reported his income had increased 338-fold  --  to $40.6 million , almost all of it from the sale of eBay stock . His adjusted gross income from 1999 to 2004 was $224,372,409 . <p> History of one Steve Westly investment <p> Experts say 33 of state Controller Steve Westly 's dot-com-era stock purchases appear to be consistent with the banned practice of laddering .

Westly says he made no such agreement . Such schemes boost the price of the stock , creating the illusion that the stock is in high demand . Paradyne Networks , whose stock rocketed up after the IPO , then plummeted , was one of the 33 Westly investments . <p> July 16 , 1999 <p> Before market opens <p> Paradyne Networks , a Florida tech manufacturer , set to go public .

Westly pays $80,015 for 1,500 more shares , a price of $53.34 . <p> July 20 , 1999 <p> Paradyne stock plunges , closing at $40.62 , down $17 from its high . <p> Before July 20 , 1999 <p> Westly sells all 3,000 shares for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses $1,408 on the post-IPO shares , but turns an overall profit of $51,698 on the deal . <p> Oct. 5 , 1999 <p> Stock price down to $26.37 . <p> Dec. 12 , 2000 <p> Stock price at $1.69 . <p> June 26 , 2003 <p> Paradyne is among 309 stock issuers that agree to pay at least $1 billion to settle investors ' class action lawsuits .
