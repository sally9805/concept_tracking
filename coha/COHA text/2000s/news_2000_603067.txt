<p> Michael Jordan works in boardrooms now . Wayne Gretzky last laced ' em up in April . The Super Bowl is over ; spring training begins next week . <p> Tiger Woods stands alone atop the sports world today . <p> Monday , he came from seven strokes behind with seven holes to play to win the Pebble Beach ( Calif . ) National Pro-Am , his sixth consecutive PGA Tour victory . The blue of the Pacific Ocean framed the fierceness of his face on the 18th green , as if its deep waters bore silent witness that victory for Tiger is his manifest destiny . <p> " I do n't know about destiny , " said Matt Gogel , the golfer whose large lead gave way to Tiger 's alchemy . " He 's just damned good . " <p> We knew Woods was good , even great , before he came on the PGA Tour four years ago with that Nike contract and killer smile . When he won The Masters in his first go as a pro , greatness was confirmed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at just 24 , is establishing himself as heir to the world Jordan made . <p> It is astounding that a golfer  --  not really an athlete in the jaundiced view of some  --  now can be mentioned in the same breath with Jordan and Gretzky , the best ever in their sports . <p> But this is no mere duffer with pitching wedge in hand . He 's more like Arthur brandishing Excalibur . Except that Arthur had Lancelot  --  just as Jordan had Pippen and Gretzky had Messier . Tiger goes it alone , against 120 or so of the world 's best golfers each time out . <p> It is February , when only minor golf tournaments are played . But Tiger goes to suburban San Diego next for the Buick Invitational , where he is defending champion . When was the last time the Buick was the biggest sports story on the planet ? Never . But starting Thursday the world will be watching La Jolla , Calif . <p> This is so because Woods ' win Monday gave him six Tour victories in a row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson set 55 years ago . It is one of those records that has long been considered utterly unbreakable , like Cy Young 's 511 career victories or Joe DiMaggio 's 56-game hitting streak . <p> These are defining records from other eras . Eleven consecutive Tour wins ? Arnold Palmer never won more than three in a row , Jack Nicklaus never more than two . Woods ' six consecutive wins tie him for second all time with Ben Hogan , who won his half-dozen in 1948 . Six in a row ? Eleven ? Maybe such feats were possible in the World War II era , but no more . Or so the theory used to go . <p> Stretching imagination <p> But when you watch Woods launch a 97-yard wedge shot on No. 15 that bounces 5 feet past the pin , spins sideways and rolls back into the hole for an eagle  --  well , anything seems possible . And that is the magic of men like Jordan , Gretzky and Woods : Anything seems possible  --  even what you know full well is wildly , wonderfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Woods winning all four majors this year fell from 200-1 to 80-1 this week in London . It is a sucker 's bet , the kind bookies love because no one ever cashes that ticket . Woods has won but two majors . How does he win four in one year ? No one has ever done it  --  at least not these four . And not even Tiger is likely to do it now . <p> Yet it is easy to see why bookies are nervous : The U.S. Open in June will be at the Pebble Beach course where Woods fashioned his great escape Monday . Surely he wo n't shoot a 64 after the USGA toughens the course for the event , but Pebble Beach will remain the place where his legend grew . Down seven shots with seven holes to play is like Jordan trailing by 25 in the fourth quarter or Gretzky by three goals in the third period . But Tiger pulled off his only-in-the-movies Hollywood ending , which seems about right for a course co-owned by Clint Eastwood . <p> The first major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Woods saga began with a fist-pumping win in 1997 . If he can keep his streak alive  --  a notion that is equal parts preposterous and lustrous  --  The Masters could well be where he would try to win a 12th consecutive tournament . <p> Much to prove <p> When he won that first major , the Great American Hype Machine churned full bore . Here he was , only 20 , and the question was this : Could Tiger be the next Nicklaus ? Even Nicklaus played along , predicting that this tiger cub would some day break his own record of winning 18 professional majors . <p> Jordan won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls and Gretzky four Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers . Woods has two major titles , 17 PGA Tour wins and now a winning streak that has turned up the Hype Machine another notch . The question : Is Tiger the next Jordan ? <p> The answer , at least in the sense of transcending one 's sport , is just now coming into focus . It may someday prove to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan to be fascinated by Jordan 's greatness . You do n't have to be a golf fan  --  or even to like it very much  --  to be astounded by Woods ' cunning and charisma . <p> Their stories are not the same . Jordan was cut from his junior high basketball team ; Gretzky and Woods were child prodigies . Gretzky had his picture snapped at 11 with Gordie Howe , the man whose records The Great One would go on to break . Woods swung his clubs at 2 on The Mike Douglas Show , foreshadowing the fevered fame that would come . <p> It is one more thing that these men share : The enormity of their deeds is exceeded only by the enormity of their celebrity . This kind of fame can be a crushing burden , but Jordan and Gretzky wear it well . Woods is learning to do the same . <p> Jordan and Gretzky are the greatest athletes of their generation . Each was at or near the top of those athlete-of-the-century lists . And Woods has a head start on the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fathers and sons <p> Fame morphs into myth at that stratosphere . And each of these men fulfills the American myth of fathers playing catch with sons  --  even if Gretzky is Canadian and none of them ( well , save Jordan briefly ) made his name in baseball . <p> Walter Gretzky built the backyard rink , dubbed " Wally Coliseum , " that Wayne skated on for hours on end while growing up in Brantford , Ontario . There were lights strung on a wire from the neighbors ' garage for night games . Walter was Wayne 's hockey instructor , trainer , chauffeur  --  and role model . <p> Michael Jordan credits his father , James , with teaching him right from wrong . James Jordan 's roadside murder in 1993 is the terrible tragedy of his son 's sainted life . His father always thought baseball was Michael 's best sport . When Jordan interrupted his NBA career to play minor league baseball , it was a tip of his cap to his father 's memory . <p> Earl Woods put clubs in Tiger 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . Monday he was asked if the 64 he had just shot to win at Pebble Beach was his favorite round on the storied course . <p> No , he said , that would be the pro-am he played there in 1998 with Earl , who a year earlier had undergone heart-bypass surgery . <p> " I do n't think , " Tiger said , " that can be topped . " <p> Opponents are saying much the same of him these days , just as they once said it of you-know-who . <p> Tiger Woods <p> Tiger Woods may have the best combination of physical and mental ability of any person to play the game of golf . <p> The late Ben Hogan was said to be a century man , having physical skills and mental ability that comes together in one person about every 100 years . <p> Jack Nicklaus , considered the best player of the 20th century , had amazing focus and determination that seemed to will himself to victory . <p> Woods has all those skills . At 6-2 , he 's taller than either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sprinter . <p> Coach Butch Harmon once described Woods ' success in terms of his physical and mental ability , but when asked about the drama that goes with Woods , he said , " You got me there . I do n't know why he does the things he does . " <p> Maybe that 's where Woods is truly different . <p> Wayne Gretzky <p> Wayne Gretzky thought the game differently from anyone else . He would set up behind the goal line  --  his office  --  and use the net as a pick . He would thread passes that most people would never think to try . He had great vision of the whole ice surface and the ability to anticipate plays . He also had a great hunger : If he had five points , he wanted six . <p> Not only did he dominate statistically  --  five of his scoring titles were by 70 or more points  --  he had a flair for the dramatic . When he tied Gordie Howe 's points record , it was with a tying goal in the closing minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Gretzky finished his 20-year NHL career with four Stanley Cup Championships , 10 Art Ross Trophies as the NHL scoring leader and nine Hart Trophies as league MVP . He owns or shares 61 NHL records . <p> Michael Jordan <p> Michael Jordan never accepted losing . He did n't want to lose anything  --  not the scoring title , not the NBA title , not a scrimmage in practice , not a game of H-O-R-S-E , a game of cards , a golf match . As a result he stacked the deck in his favor by always being prepared . <p> He had an incredible tolerance to pain and drove himself to be the best with an incredible work ethic . Jordan was extremely intelligent . <p> The five-time league MVP saw things others could n't see , and he knew how to get all of his teammates to perform to their fullest . <p> He also understood that conditioning was a key , and late in his career , he instituted " The Breakfast Club . " Each morning , Bulls teammates Scottie Pippen and Ron Harper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his personal trainer . Then they 'd have breakfast  --  and then they 'd go to practice . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : February 10 , 2000 , Thursday <p> CORRECTION : A story in the Feb. 9 edition should have said Jack Nicklaus won three consecutive PGA Tour events in 1975.
