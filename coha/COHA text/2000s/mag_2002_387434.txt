Here , author Rick Moody is inspired by art from Tina Barney . // Ma mixing drinks under that etching of Christ . Road to Calvary . There were the drinks , there were the LPs on the shelf beside the bar , there was that Swinging London vase on the coffee table . A Degas book , a Picasso book , and Moneys Years at Giverny . I was all dolled up , you know , in a beige miniskirt . An off-the-shoulder top . Some bangles . There was Christ , there was Ma in her red dress . It brought out the rosy tones in her face . She was young once , but along came me and the bassinet and now she was older . There were drinks , there were LPs . I had a cut on my arm . A little thing . It was good to feel worldly , to feel thin , or at least I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to wear black , very important . Never can wear too much black . The beige mini brought out my skin tone , which drew attention to my eyes , which were like the walls , that 's what I was thinking , that it definitely had to be a teal room , definitely had to be a catalog color , like Caribbean cove or something , and my eyes matched the hue , and there was the cut on my arm . Was n't anything to get hysterical about . An abrasion , guess you 'd call it . Ma had n't seen yet . You 'd take off that plastic strip , right , that bandage , if you knew company was coming ? So why did n't I take it off ? Did n't want it to be a topic of conversation , I guess . I was fine , more or less , with the implications of a wound . A hint of the thing was better than the actual scabbed-over thing . The plastic strip matched the draperies , and my eyes are blue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm trying to bell you . It was a real room , had to be . I bite my nails unless I have them polished clear . Sometimes I bite them anyway . There was an old Rolling Stones album playing , and there was Christ dragging that hunk of wood up a hill . Everywhere you looked . Anything by Handel is cool , no lie , and maybe Ma changed the record and put on an old LP of Handel 's Royal Fireworks . Got rid of the Rolling Stones . All the same to me . They 're old . It was a little thing . The cut . Puncture wound , if you 're curious . Was n't anything to get hysterical about . Ma had n't seen . Her back was turned . Somebody 's back is always turned . Some woman has turned her back , and the vase never has any flowers in it , and the room is always overheated . Swinging London . My hair had grown out . The roots did n't match the miniskirt , which did n't match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Failure , in terms of the matching part , if you know what I mean . Ma was about to give me a piece of her mind . It was just before she gave me a piece of her mind . Someone was always turning her back , and someone was always giving me a piece of her mind , and Christ was always lugging that tree up the hill . They stuck him in the side . A puncture wound , right ? Water ran out of him . I 'd have had a drink myself , you know ? If she 'd let me . But I 've quit with all that , in her house . In her teal room , in her Caribbean cove . It all made me nervous , the puncture wound , the living room . I guess my eyes did n't exactly match the wall , you know ? Maybe that 's where the trouble started . Back a ways . Rick Moody is the author of three novels and two collections of short stories . His latest book , The Black Veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was published in May . Tina Barney 's exhibit The English is currently on view at the Janet Borden Gallery in New York City . This series will be published in a 2003 calendar , which will be sold to raise money for victims of terrorism . <p>
