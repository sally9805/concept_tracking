For a period lasting over a century , the most effective way to determine longitude was to observe the Galilean moons of Jupiter . <p> On July 15 , 1806 , Captain Zebulon Pike led a party of 23 soldiers and 51 Amerindians westward out of St. Louis , Missouri . One of Captain Pike 's assignments was to escort the Amerindians back to their villages . He was then to continue on and explore the southwestern part of Thomas Jefferson 's new Louisiana Purchase . On this very day , Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were near the Great Falls of the Missouri River ( in Montana ) on the last leg of their return journey , which would end in September . They had been sent to explore the rich fur-trapping areas of the northern part of the purchase . Later in his expedition , Pike traveled to eastern Colorado and described a mountain that now bears his name , Pike 's Peak . <p> On August 23 , 1806 , Pike camped with the Osage Amerindians in their villages near the Kansas-Missouri border . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal altitudes and a meridional altitude of the Sun , but owing to flying clouds , missed the immersion of Jupiter 's satellites . " In the middle of what Pike would later call " the great American Desert , " surrounded by hostile Amerindians , hundreds of kilometers from civilization , he was looking through a telescope . Is n't this rather strange behavior for a rugged adventurer ? Actually no , for Pike was doing what explorers had been doing for more than a century : He was using Jupiter 's moons to determine his longitude . Longing for Longitude <p> It 's easy to find one 's latitude by measuring the altitude of the North Star ( Polaris ) . Alternatively , one can measure the peak height of the noon Sun , or of a star after dark , and then find the latitude from a set of tables . Longitude , on the other hand , is much more difficult to determine . <p> Being at 40 north latitude means you are somewhere on a circle that runs around the world 40 north of the equator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will appear 40 above the northern horizon on any location on that circle and the Sun 's peak altitude will be the same . The only difference will be that the Sun will peak at different times at different points on the circle as Earth rotates . So time is the key to finding longitude . Tables can tell you when the Sun or certain stars will peak over Greenwich , England . It takes Earth 24 hours to complete one 360 rotation , so Earth turns 15 per hour . If you have an accurate clock set to Greenwich time , and the Sun peaks an hour later at your location than the table says it peaks in Greenwich , you are one hour ( or 15 ) west of Greenwich . Given an accurate clock , you can easily determine longitude . <p> But prior to about 1770 , clocks were not accurate enough to determine longitude . Travelers could only make crude estimates of their longitude . This was a real concern for sailing ships , which were constantly in danger of running aground because of poor longitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast of England ( commanded by Sir Clowdisley Shovell ) ran aground on the Scilly Islands during a storm , with the loss of 2,000 lives . Those 2,000 deaths in the England of 1707 were equivalent to about 60,000 deaths in today 's America . Imagine the shock if 300 commercial jets crashed in one day . Almost every person would know a victim . The public outcry in England forced the Admiralty to offer a prize of 20,000 pounds , a fortune at the time , to anyone who could solve the longitude problem . <p> To win the Admiralty 's prize , one had to determine longitude to within half a degree after a long ocean voyage . At the equator , Earth 's circumference is about 40,000 kilometers ( 24,900miles ) and the Sun takes 24 hours to circle . So the Sun appears to move at 1,670 kilometers ( 1,040 miles ) per hour , or 15 per hour ( 1 in 4 minutes ) . To win the prize , the clock had to be within half a degree ( or 2 minutes ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day for a year would be off by 365 seconds , or 6 minutes . In 1707 , no clock in the world came anywhere near the required accuracy . <p> A century earlier Galileo had to use crude water clocks for his work on falling objects . But he made two key suggestions that were of tremendous help in solving the longitude problem . The first was his observation that a pendulum could be used as a clock . By 1660 Dutch astronomer Christian Huygens had perfected the pendulum clock . But pendulum clocks that kept excellent time when hanging on a motionless wall were hopelessly inaccurate when carried over rough terrain or on a pitching ship . A Heavenly Clock <p> It was Galileo 's second idea that led to a successful method of determining longitude . In 1609-1610 Galileo had used his new telescope to discover four moons circling Jupiter ( later named Io , Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto ) . Galileo quickly realized that the steady procession of circling moons was a heavenly clock that could be seen from anywhere on Earth whenever Jupiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take observations of the eclipses of the moons and predict the times of future eclipses . An observer anywhere on Earth would look at tables to see if any eclipses occurred that day or in the next few days . The observer would pick some likely eclipses based on estimates of one 's longitude . The observer would look at Jupiter , identify the moons , and watch an eclipse . The observer could then set his or her clock to the listed Greenwich time for that eclipse . <p> An extremely accurate clock was no longer needed . With the clock now set correctly to Greenwich time , in the next few days one would measure the time when the noon Sun peaked . The observer would then compare this time with the Greenwich time listed in the almanac . If the Sun peaked 5 hours later than the table said it would , the longitude would be 5 hours times 15 per hour , or 75 west of Greenwich . And that is exactly why Zebulon Pike was observing Jupiter 's moons from that lonely Kansas prairie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Galileo was never able to calculate the eclipses accurately enough . That honor fell to Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini , who published an improved set of tables in 1668 . Cassini had emigrated to France after King Louis XIV had formed the Royal Academy of Science . The king wanted to make France the world leader in science , so he was recruiting the world 's best scientists . Cassini 's work was perfect for another of the Academy 's projects , the accurate mapping of France . This endeavor required the determination of longitude , the very thing that Cassini 's work promised to do with unsurpassed accuracy . So the king made Cassini an offer he could n't refuse . <p> Cassini 's team traveled to the major cities of France and with its telescopes observed an eclipse of one of Jupiter 's moons . This enabled the team to set its clocks to the correct reference time . The next day the team members would time when the Sun peaked . If it peaked one-tenth of an hour later than the time the tables listed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of Paris . With the Sun moving at about 1,600 kilometers ( 1,000 miles ) an hour , this placed the city 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) west of Paris . <p> The results were revelatory . It was only a few hundred miles from Paris to the coastal cities over roads that had been trodden by Roman engineers and countless Frenchmen . Yet these cities were actually up to 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) closer to Paris than the old maps had indicated . This was a huge error , which exposed the inaccuracies in the older methods . King Louis is rumored to have said , " I pay my astronomers well and they have diminished my kingdom . " <p> Having mapped France , Cassini and his team moved on to do the world . France was in an expansionist phase and her explorers were everywhere , closely followed by her Jesuit priests . Cassini began to train mathematically minded young priests . When they reached their assigned destinations , they measured the latitude and longitude and sent the results back to Paris . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map on the third floor of the Observatoire de Paris . A circle about 10 meters in diameter was drawn on the floor with the North Pole at the center . As longitudes from around the world were reported , they were added to this map . Cities and far-flung locales such as Qubec , Santiago , Lisbon , Venice , Cairo , Siam , India , Canton , and Peking were added . The first accurate map of the world slowly took shape . In 1696 Cassini published his new map , the first ever to use Jupiter 's moons to determine longitude . The era of truly accurate maps had arrived . More than a century later , Zebulon Pike 's observations went into improved maps of the American West . Problems at Sea <p> But a technique that worked well on land was hopeless at sea . No one standing on the moving deck of a ship could possibly keep a telescope trained on those tiny moons of Jupiter , so the Admiralty continued to search for a suitable method of determining longitude . In 1775 Captain Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing chronometer built by John Harrison , which easily met the requirements for the Longitude Prize . <p> Harrison was an English clockmaker who devoted his life to perfecting a clock that could win the prize ( Dava Sobel describes his trials and tribulations in her excellent book Longitude ) . One of Harrison 's sea trials was a trip to the Caribbean , where the chronometer 's prediction of longitude was checked by observations of Jupiter 's moons . <p> After a century of being the only accurate method of determining longitude , Jupiter 's moons had a serious rival . In fact , it had two rivals . Britain 's Astronomer Royal , Nevil Maskelyne , had introduced a method called " lunar distances , " which used the Moon 's motion against the backdrop of fixed stars . In principle this was the same as using the motions of Jupiter 's moons around Jupiter . But the technique was very complicated , requiring three measurements of angles in the sky as close together in time as possible along with at least 30 minutes of calculations . Its advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's glare as often as Jupiter was . Eventually , the chronometer method would prevail . It was the simplest and it could be used on days when the Sun or clouds interfered with measurements of the Moon or Jupiter . <p> Jupiter 's moons still had some advantages , so this method would not die easily . Zebulon Pike 's 1806 expedition could n't afford a chronometer even if one had been available in St. Louis . In addition , the lunar distance method was so difficult that Pike went with the old but reliable method of observing Jupiter 's moons . Three years earlier , Lewis and Clark 's well-financed expedition had carried a chronometer purchased in Philadelphia and equipment for using the lunar distance method , which Thomas Jefferson favored . A few months into the trip the chronometer stopped . <p> Chronometers , which worked fine when kept in a special case in the captain 's cabin , could not take the pounding of a long trip on a packhorse or the rocking of a canoe on a wild river . These were delicate scientific instruments ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the situation had just reversed . Jupiter 's moons worked fine on land but not on a ship . Chronometers worked fine on ships , but they could n't hold up during extended journeys across land . <p> Clark reset his chronometer with the lunar distance method whenever it stopped , but with only a few weeks of training in the technique , his results were disappointing . Ferdinand Hassler , the West Point mathematician who was given the observations , was reported by Jefferson in 1817 to have " given up the calculations in despair . " <p> In 1832 Captain Benjamin Bonneville used Jupiter 's moons to determine his longitude on his western expedition . John Fremont 's western expeditions of 1842-44 carried multiple chronometers , all of which broke or ran erratically . Fremont eventually used Jupiter 's moons to determine his longitude . But these were last gasps of a dying system . Chronometers were getting better , and this improvement , along with the ability to send time signals by telegraph , led to the demise of the Jupiter moons system . Thus a method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only accurate way to determine longitude for 100 years , and which played an important role for another 70 years , fell by the wayside of scientific progress . <p> The moons of Jupiter still endlessly circle the giant planet , and Jupiter still shines down upon us as it has through the ages . So next time you are out on a starry night and look up and see Jupiter , take a moment to think of Galileo , Cassini , the Jesuit priests , Zebulon Pike , John Fremont , and all the others who gazed across 600 million kilometers into the blackness of space in order to determine just where they stood on this green Earth . Determine Your Longitude with Jupiter 's Moons <p> It was MIT physicist Philip Morrison who taught me , in a television documentary , how to use Jupiter 's moons as a system for synchronizing clocks . This is the first step in calculating longitude with astronomical observations . With an ephemeris for Jupiter satellite transits and occultations that is accurate for the time at the Royal Greenwich Observatory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the scheduled event . The difference between your local time and Greenwich local time reveals your longitude . <p> On a clear night in late February , I decided to try this experiment . I set up my 4-inch refractor on my back deck outside my house in San Rafael , California . My favorite Jupiter ephemeris ( **31;3136;TOOLONG ) predicted an occultation of Europa for 0510 Greenwich Mean Time ( GMT ) the following day , or 9:10 p.m . Pacific Standard Time , my local " standard " clock . This event provided a splendid opportunity to synchronize my own GMT clock . <p> These days it 's easy to set your watch to GMT . My computer stays synchronized to a variety of reference clocks available on the Internet using the network time protocol ( NTP ) . So I already knew that my watch was correct . <p> At about 8:40 p.m. , I had my mount aligned and tracking , and Jupiter was looking big and beautiful . I wanted to test my ability to judge the precise moment when the occultation was complete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was several minutes before the ephemeris 's predicted time when I first saw Europa brushing against Jupiter 's limb . It was like watching a very distant sunset as Europa sank farther behind Jupiter 's disk , appearing as a tiny lump on the edge . The lump shrank to a smaller dot , but it was still there . Would I be able to tell the exact moment of occultation ? I looked again and could n't see Europa . " But wait , " I thought , " there 's still a tiny pinpoint on the edge . Or is it just my imagination ? " <p> Finally it was clear that nothing was left . No odd pinpoints appeared even when I used averted vision . It was time . I looked at my watch . It was 9:10:30  --  dead center in the designated minute . <p> Following through with the experiment , now that I had a clock synchronized to GMT , I could calculate the sidereal time at Greenwich . Sidereal time , the right ascension coordinate crossing overhead at any particular moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between the sidereal time at a reference location ( Greenwich ) and the local sidereal time , expressed as degrees instead of hours , minutes , and seconds . <p> But my experiment was missing a crucial piece of equipment that a 19th-century surveyor would have had : a transit scope . A transit scope points only along the meridian . The mount would be plumbed to vertical , and aligned very carefully with the north celestial pole . I could approximate a transit scope by turning off my mount 's clock drive and reorienting the mount so the telescope is constrained to rotate along a line including the zenith and the north celestial pole . Alas , most telescope mounts , mine included , wo n't twist into such a configuration . <p> If I had such a device , I could watch for any charted star to cross my local meridian . At that moment , my local sidereal time would match the right ascension of that star . I would consult my recently synchronized GMT clock and convert that time to the Greenwich sidereal time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and Greenwich sidereal time , convert it to degrees , and bingo ! Longitude . Morris Jones <p> Watching Jupiter 's Moons <p> Jupiter 's moons and their shadows routinely cross the planet 's face from our point of view . This is because we 're viewing Jupiter and its moons along the Jovian system 's orbital plane . Such crossings are called transits . Io transits every 1.77 days , while Europa traverses every 3.55 days . It 's 7.15 days between transits for more distant Ganymede and 16.69 days between transits for Callisto , when transits happen at all . <p> A 6-inch or larger backyard telescope working at 200-power will show transiting moons as disks against Jupiter 's face . Io 's disk appears grayish on Jupiter 's cloudtops , while Europa is very light and often difficult to recognize , especially when it lies in front of a bright band in Jupiter 's atmosphere , Ganymede and Callisto appear somewhat darker , so they are usually easy to see . The best time to spot a transiting moon is just as it enters or leaves Jupiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibly against Jupiter 's edge ( limb ) , which is darkened because of the effects of our looking through a thicker cross section of the planet 's atmosphere . <p> Transits of moon shadows are even easier to spot . There 's no mistaking a black dot-like impression on Jupiter 's cloudtops . Before Jupiter reaches opposition , shadows creep onto the planet 's disk before the satellite begins its transit . After opposition , the satellite goes first . In the case of Ganymede and Callisto , several hours can elapse between the time when a satellite first transits and when its shadow appears . <p> Periodically , Jupiter eclipses each of the four large moons as they pass into the planet 's mammoth shadow . In a telescope , a moon 's brightness takes several minutes to fade to black as it enters the shadow . Reappearances are just as gradual . <p> When Earth passes directly between Jupiter and the Sun ( meaning Jupiter comes to opposition ) , as it did last December 31 , Jupiter 's shadow fails directly behind the planet . ( Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing geometry changes just a bit during the months leading up to and away from opposition . Our perspective allows us to peer slightly around the left or right side of Jupiter and look down this shaft of darkness . <p> This May and June , the shadow projects from behind the planet 's left , or east , side . After Jupiter passes behind the Sun on July 20 and emerges into the morning sky , we 'll be looking in on the shadow emerging from the planet 's right , or western , limb . <p> Io orbits so close to Jupiter that , depending upon our viewing perspective , we see it either entering or exiting Jupiter 's shadow . We never see both on the same evening . This is because Jupiter 's disk almost entirely obscures our view of the planet 's shadow at Io 's distance from Jupiter . After opposition , we always see Io disappear behind the limb of Jupiter and then reappear from the planet 's shadow . Conversely , before opposition we always see Io disappear into the shadow and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds true for Europa . Ganymede and Callisto , however , are far enough from Jupiter so that we see both entry into and exit out of eclipses , except at times near opposition . Eclipse lengths vary because these moons do n't always pass through the middle of Jupiter 's shadow : Ganymede averages 3.25 hours , while Callisto takes about 4 hours . <p> Because of a combination of Sun angles ( because of the slight tilt of Jupiter 's axis to its orbit ) and Callisto 's distance from Jupiter , Callisto misses Jupiter 's shadow entirely for 3 years at a time . Callisto entered its most recent eclipse season late last year and will regularly pass through Jupiter 's shadow on each orbit until about 2004 . <p> To get the lowdown on everything happening with the moons of Jupiter , including their eclipse times , visit http : **51;3169;TOOLONG .
