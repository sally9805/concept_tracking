TV special The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus was a Mick Jagger  --  helmed vanity project that somehow went horribly right . The chaotic show  --  a hybrid of circus and rock concert with some of the hottest acts in swinging London ( John Lennon , the Who )  --  was shelved in the 1960s and not released on video until 1996 . The new DVD adds commentary from Jagger , Yoko Ono and others . Keith Richards mumbles the best line : " I remember not remembering everything towards the end . " But watching a young Jagger lead the Stones through sublimely insolent versions of You Ca n't Always Get What You Want and Sympathy for the Devil is simply unforgettable .
