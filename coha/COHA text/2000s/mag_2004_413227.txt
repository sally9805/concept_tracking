( ProQuest Information and Learning : ... denotes obscured text omitted . ) Bill and Hillary Clinton often tell the story of how they met : They locked eyes across Yale 's law library , until Hillary broke the silent flirtation and marched straight over to Bill . " Look , if you 're going to keep staring at me , and I 'm going to keep staring back , we might as well be introduced . I 'm Hillary Rodham . What 's your name ? " Bill has said he could n't remember his own name . It was quite a first impression , one so powerful that it sparked a few chapters of U.S. history . Initial encounters are emotionally concentrated events that can overwhelm us-even convince us that the room is spinning . We walk away from them with a first impression that is like a Polaroid picture-a headto-toe image that develops instantly and never entirely fades . Often , that snapshot captures important elements of the truth . Consider one study in which untrained subjects were shown 20- to 32-second videotaped segments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicants on attributes such as self-assurance and likability . Surprisingly , their assessments were very close to those of trained interviewers who spent at least 20 minutes with each applicant . What semblance of a person-one with a distinct appearance , history and complex personality-could have been captured in such a fleeting moment ? The answer lies in part in how the brain takes firstimpression Polaroids-creating a composite of all the signals given off by a new experience . Psychologists agree that snap judgments are a holistic phenomenon in which clues ( mellifluous voice , Rolex watch , soggy handshake , hunched shoulders ) hit us all at once and form an impression larger than their sum . We do search for one particular sign on a new face : a smile . " We can pick up a smile from 30 meters away , " says Paul Ekman , professor of psychology at the University of California Medical School in San Francisco , and a pioneer of research on facial expressions . " A smile lets us know that we 're likely to get a positive reception , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we flash that return grin , our Polaroid shutter will have already closed . Just three seconds are sufficient to make a conclusion about fresh acquaintances . Nalini Ambady , professor of psychology at Tufts University in Medford , Massachusetts , studies first impressions carved from brief exposure to another person 's behavior , what she calls " thin slices " of experience . She says humans have developed the ability to quickly decide whether a new person will hurt or enrich us-judgments that had lifesaving ramifications in an earlier era . She believes that thin slices are generated in the most primitive area of the brain , where feelings are also processed , which accounts for the emotional punch of some first encounters . Immediate distrust of a certain car salesman or affinity for a prospective roommate originates in the deepest corners of the mind . The ability to interpret thin slices evolved as a way for our ancestors to protect themselves in an eat-or-beeaten world , whereas modern-day threats to survival often come in the form of paperwork ( dwindling stock portfolios ) or intricate social rituals ( impending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience help us navigate modern encounters-from hitchhikers to blind dates-is up for debate . Ekman says that people excel at reading facial expressions quickly , but only when a countenance is genuine . Most people can not tell if someone is feigning an emotion , he says , " unless their eyes have been trained to spot very subtle expressions that leak through . " Consider anger : When we are boiling mad , our lips narrow-an expression we ca n't make on demand when we 're pretending . And the accuracy of a snap judgment always depends on what exactly we 're sizing up . Ekman does n't think we can use a thin slice of behavior to judge , say , if someone is smart enough to be our study partner or generous enough to lend us a bus token . " But we can pretty easily distinguish one emotion from another , particularly if it 's on the face for a second or more . " Spending more time with a genuine person , he says , wo n't yield a more accurate sense of that person 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // First impressions are not merely hardwired reactions-we are also taught how to judge others , holding our thin slices up to the light of social stereotypes . Brian Nosek , professor of psychology at the University of Virginia , studies the implicit attitudes that enter into our calculations . Just because someone carries an ACLU membership card or makes a point to invite their seniorcitizen friends to dance-club outings does n't mean they do n't have prejudices bubbling under the surface . Nosek and colleagues administer a quick online test that reveals the beliefs people either ca n't or wo n't report . Called the Implicit Association Test , it asks participants to pair concepts , such as " young " with " good , " or " elderly " with " good . " If , in some part of his mind , " old " is more closely related to " bad " than to " good , " the test taker will respond more quickly to the first pairing of words than to the second . In versions of these tests , small differences in response times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the elderly , AfricanAmericans over Caucasians or for President Bush over President Kennedy . " When I took the test , " says Nosek , " I showed a bias toward whites . I was shocked . We call it unconsciousness-raising , in contrast to the consciousness-raising of the 1960s . " As subtle as implicit attitudes are , they can cause serious real-world damage . If an angry person stumbles upon someone of a different race or religion , he is likely to perceive that person negatively , according to recent research . Anger incites instinctive prejudiced responses toward " outsiders , " a finding that has important implications for people in law enforcement and security . Certain physical features consistently prompt our brains to take first-impression Polaroids with a distorting filter . People who have a " baby face , " characterized by a round shape , large eyes and small nose and chin , give off the impression of trustworthiness and naiveteon average , a false assumption . A pretty face also leads us astray : Our tendency is to perceive beautiful people as healthier and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIKE A CRIMINAL ? // Leslie Zebrowitz , professor of psychology at Brandeis University in Massachusetts , argues that we overgeneralize in the presence of baby mugs and homely visages . Humans are hardwired to recognize a baby as an innocent , weak creature who requires protection . By the same token , mating with someone who is severely deformed , and thereby unattractive , may keep your DNA from spreading far and wide . But we overgeneralize these potentially helpful built-in responses , coddling adults with babyish miens who in fact do n't need our care and shunning unattractive people who may not meet our standards of beauty but certainly do n't pose an imminent threat to our gene pool . Zebrowitz has found that many baby-faced grown-ups , particularly young men , overcompensate for misperceptions by cultivating tougher-than-average personalities in an attempt to ward off cheek-pinching aunts . Think of the sweet-faced rapper Eminem , who never cracks a smile , or the supermodel-juggling , hard-partying actor Leonardo DiCaprio .

Photograph HAVE YOU EVER FELT REJECTED ? // " A good judge of personality is n't just someone who is smarter-it 's someone who gets out and spends time with people , " says David Funder , a professor of psychology at the University of California at Riverside , who believes in the overall accuracy of snap judgments . Funder has found that two observers often reach a consensus about a third person , and the assessments are accurate in that they match the third person 's assessment of himself . " We 're often fooled , of course , but we 're more often right . " On the other side of the equation , some people are simpler to capture at first glance than others . " The people who are easiest to judge are the most mentally healthy , " says Randy Colvin , associate professor of psychology at Northeastern University in Boston .

CURB CONVERSATIONAL NARCISSISM He 's talking about his new Subaru , which reminds you of the battle you waged-and won-with that smarmy Hertz-rental-car dealer in Miami last month.This " faux segue " is a big no-no , says psychologist and business consultant Valerie White . " We are tempted to share impressive things about ourselves , but the one idea you should keep in mind is " How am I making the other person feel ? ' " Actively encourage others to talk about themselves , and respond genuinely-without bringing it back to you . DO N'T BETRAY YOUR ANXIETY " If you 're not quick-witted or wellversed in certain subjects , you can still make a great impression , " White says . Just focus on the other person.This in turn will take the pressure off you . However , avoid interrogating a new acquaintance . If you 're jittery , control movements such as leg twitching . And remember to speak slowly-nervousness makes us talk too fast . FAKE A SUNNY MOOD " Be yourself " is solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's worth suppressing a bad mood when you meet someone new . While you know you are just experiencing a momentary state , a new acquaintance will take you for a full-time complainer . " There is a contagion effect , " says White . " A bad mood will bring the other person down , too . Try to start off well , and then share what 's bothering you . " Sidebar THE EYES HAVE IT If you want to get to know a stranger , break with body language conventions by catching her eye for more than a second.When you first meet someone , author and lecturer Nicholas Boothman says , focus on your eye contact , your smile and your posture . " If you notice somebody 's eye color , and you say " great " to yourself , you will actually be smiling , and you will give off a super mood . " GET IN SYNC Adjusting your posture , voice , words and gestures to match those of a new acquaintance is critical , says Boothman , because we are attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond when you speak at their pace , " agrees White . To establish an instant rapport , mirror your new friend 's head nods and tilts . USE FLATTERY , SPARINGLY " People like to be flattered , " says White . " Even if they suspect you are brownnosing , they still like it . " But use flattery judiciously-focus on the other person 's accomplishments or achievements . This works best when a person believes you do n't say ingratiating things to just anyone . THE DO-OVER You arrive at a party fuming over a parking ticket . A cheery guest introduces herself , but you brush her off and head for the bar . You 've made a bad impression , but you can recover if you demonstrate self-awareness , says White . Pull her aside and say , " I was n't myself earlier . " Show your sense of humor : " I see you met my evil twin . " And remember to cut others slack if they make a bad impression on you. - C.F .
