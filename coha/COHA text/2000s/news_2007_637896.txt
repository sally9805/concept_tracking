<p> Two weeks after federal officials passed import restrictions against some Chinese farm-raised seafood , U.S. importers say Chinese officials have vastly slowed the flow of seafood exports while they test the products . <p> " Not much will move out of China for the next two or three weeks , " says Robert Paterson , CEO of Tampa Bay Fisheries , an importer . <p> " They are being extra cautious , " says Carlos Sanchez of Beaver Street Fisheries , a leading frozen-seafood importer . <p> The Chinese are reacting to a June28 Food and Drug Administration import alert . It says the FDA may detain Chinese shipments of farm-raised shrimp , catfish , eel , basa ( a type of catfish ) and dace ( similar to carp ) . <p> They wo n't be released into commerce until the importer or shipper proves they are free of anti-fungals or antibiotics used to battle diseases but not allowed in human food . Some of the chemicals are known or suspected carcinogens and may pose a health concern over long periods , the FDA says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDA has ever imposed on imported foods  --  came after FDA tests revealed 25% of sampled products contained trace levels of chemicals . To get seafood released , importers or shippers will typically have to test the products and provide results to the FDA , a process that importers seek to avoid because it can take weeks . <p> So far , restaurants and retailers have n't been affected because there were ample inventories when the restrictions began , Sanchez says . But some disruption is likely , especially for shrimp , the No.1 seafood for U.S. consumers . China supplies about 10% of the USA 's shrimp . Weeks from now , supply may tighten because not only are shipments delayed in China , but they also may take weeks to clear the FDA , Sanchez says . <p> Some Chinese shrimp companies have opted not to ship to the USA now , says David Lam , president of Tai Foong USA , a seafood importer in Seattle . " They 're scared to ship , " he says . " Our supply chain has been disrupted . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed from China to the USA . Normally , it would have a handful , Lam says . <p> Lam expects some importers to buy more product from other countries until Chinese seafood moves more smoothly through the import process . Thailand supplies far more shrimp to the USA than does China , and U.S. importers say they expect companies there to try to raise prices . <p> The biggest supply-chain bottleneck is likely to be the FDA , says Martin Mitchell , managing director of Certified Laboratories , one of the leading labs that importers use to test products detained by the FDA . <p> He is getting orders for tests of Chinese seafood that arrived after the alert began . The tests are likely to take two weeks , and the FDA typically takes another two weeks to review results , he says . The FDA " will very quickly get overwhelmed , " Mitchell says . <p> The import alert covers anti-fungals malachite green and gentian violet and antibiotics known as nitrofurans and fluoroquinolones . The U.S. does n't allow them in fish used for food . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carcinogens . <p> From October through May , FDA tested 89 Chinese samples of catfish , basa , shrimp , dace and eel . Twenty-five percent contained disallowed drug residues . Imports of Chinese eel have been restricted since last year because of malachite green concerns . <p> The FDA said there was no immediate risk to consumers  --  and said people could safely eat products they had at home  --  but it defended the alert as a long-term public-health measure . <p> More demand for U.S. shrimp <p> The alert has had some impact on demand . Tampa Bay Fisheries , which imports shrimp from China and also processes U.S. shrimp , has seen orders for domestic shrimp rise about 5% , says Paterson . Sanchez , too , says a few customers have backed off temporarily from buying from China . <p> That response will quickly fade as headlines shift , predicts seafood industry analyst Howard Johnson , president of H.M. Johnson and Associates . " Once companies get assurance that the products are OK , they 'll go back to it , " he says . <p> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand a global market . " If we 're going to keep eating seafood like we do , we 'll need China , " says Johnson , noting that U.S. per capita seafood consumption is about 15 pounds a year . <p> Costco Wholesale does n't import any of the five seafoods from China now subject to more rigorous testing . But Craig Wilson , assistant vice president of food safety , says companies will quickly adjust to the added time it takes to get products from China to the USA . <p> Because the items are frozen , " You can plan for this , " he says . He would like to see more products put through more testing . " Everybody is better off , including the Chinese , when this stuff gets tested properly . " <p> International issues <p> The U.S. is n't the only country watching seafood imports closely . <p> Canada and several other countries also have restricted , at various times , imports of Chinese eel . Japan inspects 25% of shrimp imports , says the Southern Shrimp Alliance . The FDA says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To get seafood into the European Union , countries must show they have good safety controls . The U.S. does n't require that countries have food-safety systems equivalent to the USA 's , but domestic and foreign companies that export to the USA must have safety plans to guard against contaminants . <p> While Chinese officials are requiring more testing and exercising more oversight in China , some companies there are , too . <p> Hai Yang International , based in Toronto but with processing plants in China , now samples and tests every batch of seafood products headed to the USA , says Allan Bradley , vice president . The tests look for such things as bacteria and prohibited antibiotics . <p> Before this spring , when contaminated pet-food ingredients drew worldwide attention to Chinese food safety , Hai Yang tested only random batches of product . <p> Hai Yang 's biggest products are salmon , pollock , cod and tilapia  --  products not covered by the recent import alert . Still , Bradley says , customers tend to lump all the China seafood products together , and Hai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare , " he says . " We said , ' Let 's rebuild customer confidence .
