Kids and cars Re : " Keep Them Safe " ( January ) . When I read the story about April Eisses ' car accident , I could hardly get through it for my tears . On December 10 , 2006 , my husband and I , along with our two children , were on our way to a local Christmas tree farm to pick out our tree . We were hit head-on by a drunk driver who crossed the centre line ; both vehicles were destroyed . We were all buckled up , and our then two-year- old was in his car seat , asleep . Our eight-year-old was taken by ambulance to hospital ( he is OK ) and my husband and I had injuries , but nowhere near the extent of April 's . Our little son merely had a bruise on his inner leg from the crotch strap . It is so important to have children in properly anchored seats for their weight and height , regardless of age . We feel blessed that we survived and are all still together . This experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents happen ; we can not control others ' actions , but we can safeguard our families . Thank you for telling these stories so others can be informed too . KATHLEEN BILLETT Westbank , BC THANK YOU FOR YOUR 2009 commitment to keep Canadian children safe . Many childhood injuries and deaths are preventable , and I commend your co-effort with Safe Kids Canada to have the government create a national injury prevention strategy ! Before our son 's birth , my husband and I researched various types of car seats and strollers . Knowing that I would occasionally need to take a taxi , as I do n't have a driver 's licence , it was important to me that the car seat be easy to install and remove . Two weeks after our precious bundle arrived , I took him by taxi to his first doctor 's appointment . The taxi driver told me just to throw my son 's seat in the back of the car , and hold him on my lap ! Was he crazy ? Did n't Canada have laws that required a properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Alberta , a taxi is considered public transportation and car seats are not required . Why is it OK to simply hold a child in a taxi , yet it is illegal for someone to do so in their own vehicle ? I hope that my experience will help Safe Kids Canada and the federal and provincial governments to recognize the importance of child safety seats regardless of the transportation mode . I love my child and I want to ensure that he is safe . SAYLOR MCLENNAN Edmonton Editor 's note : Thank you , Kathleen and Saylor , for sharing your dramatic stories ; they help make the case for a national injury prevention strategy , part of our Healthy Kids 2009 program .

My son was born prematurely and was in the NICU , which made breastfeeding a challenge . I , too , experienced some discouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries , but ended up reinforcing my determination to breastfeed . My son is 11 months old and continues to nurse ; far from the struggles of our hospital days , we now share relaxed feedings . When I read Annae 's story , I had complete admiration for her courage . Motherhood is powerful . Thank you , Today 's Parent , for all the information that you provide on breastfeeding . STACEY ION Brantford , Ont . You 'll be missed , Evelyn I JUST READ IN THE FEBRUARY issue of Today 's Parent that Cooking with Kids columnist Evelyn Raab is leaving , and I actually have tears well- ing ! I 've loved Evelyn 's stories and recipes since I started subscribing to Today 's Parent when my now 10-year-old twins were just toddlers . As a fellow mother of boys , reading her stories of destruction and reconciliation , I felt less harried just knowing I was n't alone . And I laughed out loud when I read that her two sons were not actually the young boys she always wrote about , but had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown to trust her recipes as dishes that my boys will likely enjoy .

In the past few months , though , the magazine has changed . Now , every issue has at least one article that deals with something I am currently facing with one of my three daughters . In the latest issue , it was the " The Constant Nurser " ( Steps &; Stages , February ) , which my fourmonth-old has suddenly become , as well as " Best in the Box " and " Dinnertime Detours . " Whatever you 're doing , keep doing it ! VICTORIA SWANSON Toronto Missed deals RE : " BEST DEALS FOR FAMILIES " ( January ) . I was disappointed and surprised to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clothing , second-hand options were not explored . There are many consignment stores , an option which is hugely popular . Besides clothes , these stores also carry good-quality used children 's toys and books . Also , in our neighbourhood , we have a kids ' clothes sharing system . We label all of our children 's clothes with our initials and pass them around to our friends who might be able to use them . There are many other alternatives to the big-box stores !
