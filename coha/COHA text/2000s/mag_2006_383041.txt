The British and Ottoman defenders of Kars were forgotten heroes of the Crimean War . // Turkish soldiers-commanded as much , if not more so , by British officers as by their own-trade artillery fire with an invading Russian army during the Siege of Kars in 1855 ( British Library ) . // Turkish soldiers-commanded as much , if not more so , by British officers as by their own-trade artillery fire with an invading Russian army during the Siege of Karsin 1855 ( British Library ) . // Sometimes in the Caucasus Mountains the sounds of battle can reverberate for a very long distance , leaving the listener with an eerie sense of approaching conflict . In the years 1853-56 , the sounds of battle traveled just as far as they do today , and sent an ominous shiver down the backs of those who heard them . A little known but important event in the Crimean War occurred in this eastern portion of what was then the Ottoman Empire . At the town of Kars , British career officer Brigadier General William Fenwick Williams took command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated a Russian army . With the main show on the Crimean Peninsula dominating the worlds attention at the time , history has had little to say of Williams and the Turks he led . But his struggle against corruption , disease and famine , as well as an overwhelming Russian force , deserves wider recognition . Williams had previously served in the British army in a variety of capacities , including a mission to northeastern Persia in 1852 , where he observed a devastating cholera epidemic among the regions Turkish , Kurdish and Persian populations . At the outset of the Crimean War , he became a member of the Turkish Contingent , which comprised British officers , mainly from the Indian army , assigned to detached duty with the Ottoman army . James Skene , an assistant to the British ambassador at Istanbul , described them : " Some of the British officers , both of the Regular and Irregular Divisions of the Turkish Contingent , were elderly Indians with disordered livers , who had long since dropped out of harness , and had been buried in their clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops . Others , still young , were so given to bluster and " bahawdering , " that Mrs. Quickly would certainly have objected to such " swaggering companions . " The War Department did not seem to have a very exalted notion of the qualifications for officers , in the Irregular Cavalry especially . " An " elderly Indian " was a British officer who had served many years in the East Indian army , during which he had drunk so much that he suffered from a " disordered liver . " To " bahawder " was to brag as if one was , to use the Moghul term , a bahadur , or brave warrior . In retrospect , Williams does not seem to have belonged to that category of officer , but one or two of his assistants might have . Williams ' staff included Colonel Atwell Lake , Major Christopher C. Teesdale , Captain Henry Langhorne Thompson and Dr. Humphry Sandwith . Lake was a Royal Engineer who had served in the Madras army . Teesdale was a Royal Artillery officer . Thompson had served as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sepoy unit , and had been wounded during the Burma campaign of 1852 . Sandwith had come to Williams ' aid very early in the existence of the British Military Commission to Anatolia , Turkey , and at first functioned more as an administrative assistant than as a medical doctor . // Turkish troops march toward the Armenian town of Kars in the Caucasus Mountains on January 1 , 1850 . In June 1855 , the town and its fortress became new chess pieces in the Crimean War . // At the time of the Crimean War , the Turkish army opened its officer ranks to European military men with experience-no questions asked . A number of such officers crossed Williams ' path during the campaign in eastern Turkey , men who had chiefly been involved in failed revolutions during 1848 and 1849 , and had since been forced to flee their homelands to avoid prison or execution . For example , Gyorgy Kmety and Jozsef Kollmann had fled Hungary after Austria and Russia crushed its 1849 war for independence , joining the Ottoman ranks with Turkish names and high pasha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian-occupied regions of their lost country also turned up as junior officers in Williams ' force at Kars , and one such Pole , using the adopted Muslim name of Mahmud Efendi , assisted Williams in defeating the Kurdish revolt of 1855 . The Turkish army of eastern Anatolia encountered serious difficulties . Reform in the army had begun less than 30 years before . European advisers such as Helmuth von Moltke the elder , founder of the Prussian total war strategy , had advised the sultan on military matters in the 1830s . If the old-style Turkish commanders no longer existed in the new reform army , the new-style commanders were not well trained in modern military strategy , tactics and organization . Williams disliked the Turkish officers but admired the common Turkish soldier , whom he considered an excellent fighter-as long as he could fight behind an earthwork . In addition to the regular army , Ottoman forces were supplemented by levies of irregular soldiers , including Kurds , Turcomen , Bedouin Arabs , Caucasian mountaineers ( known as Circassians ) and Laz mountaineers . These colorful soldiers served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units-and the British officers saw them as useful for carrying out patrols or raids behind enemy lines , picket duty and skirmishing . Williams ' first battle was fought with the high command of the eastern Turkish army , based at Erzurum and Kars . There , he discovered corruption from the highest general to the lowest company commander . The Turkish commanders , including Zarif Mustafa Pasha , had created false muster rolls . After the early battles of 1853-54 , dead and wounded soldiers were reported as being on duty . All things pertaining to those men-food , supplies , weapons , ammunition , uniforms and wages-were embezzled by the commanders , with the complicity of some lesser officers . To make matters worse , those Turkish generals intercepted most supplies intended for their soldiers and sold them back to army contractors for fat profits . The soldiers ' wages were also embezzled , so that many men had received no money at all for many months . The consequences were disastrous . Half the Turkish army died from disease and frostbite because they had poor rations and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter to a friend named Hanson on November 9 , 1854 , Williams described the conditions he encountered : " Having done all I can for this garrison , which now consists of 12,000 men of all arms , well housed &; I trust they will be well fed , I am off tomorrow for Erzeroom sic .... How lucky the Pashas and Colonels are that I do not command , for tomorrow at daylight I would shew them a " gallows tree " with a least 10 ropes attached thereto !

Williams relied upon Vasif Pasha , the de jure Ottoman commander in chief , and artillery commander Tahir Pasha . The British officer immediately dispatched supplies to the dwindling garrison in Kars , then snowbound , and made arrangements to bring more British officers to his assistance . An Irish officer from County Armagh , Captain William Olpherts , and a French officer , Baron de Schwarzenberg , assisted in the logistical operations in eastern Turkey . By the spring of 1855 , Williams had Colonel Lake building the siegeworks at Kars and Captain Thompson providing much-needed drill and training to the Ottoman infantry . The British Military Commission achieved sufficient authority after the corrupt generals ' dismissal that Thompson felt he could operate as a dignitary . In a letter home in 1855 , he described his routine : " On week-days we ride about among the troops , and see them drilled , look after the provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eat our dinner , and go to bed . There is no variety . " Les jours se suivent et se resemblant The days follow one upon the other and they all seem the same . ' ' " After intense labor , Kars was prepared for a siege , even as a Russian army was marching toward it . Williams took command of the city itself on June 7 , 1855 . On June 16 , the date of a Russian religious festival , massive Russian formations commenced their assault in neat and orderly ranks . Cossack and Russian cavalry sparred with Ottoman irregulars and forced them into Kars . Cossacks drove the Ottoman cavalry in slowly as the Russian infantry battalions advanced from the rear . Suddenly , the Turkish regular and irregular cavalry collapsed and made a rush for the gateway leading to the defensive works around Kars . The Russian cavalry and infantry tried to enter rapidly behind the panicked mass of skirmishers .

The Russian assault halted , and the siege began in earnest . // Turkish gunners fire their last shot in defense of Kars . Although Williams was disgusted with the corruption-riddled Ottoman officer corps , he was impressed with the dogged courage of Turkish junior officers and enlisted men . // During the stalemate that followed throughout the summer and into the fall , Williams strove to develop a strategy to convince his Russian counterpart , General Mikhail Muraviev , that the Kars garrison had plenty of supplies and high morale . The Russians , however , knew better . Their plan was to encircle the city , depriving the garrison of any outlying supply caches , then wait patiently until starvation and pestilence took their toll . During the months of relative inactivity in Kars , Colonel Lake kept busy supervising the building of . trench after trench , redoubt after redoubt , until the outer defensive network was nearly impregnable . Working all day as an engineer , he also did duty at night as commander of the guard , riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inspect every guard post and picket , ensuring that the men did not sleep on duty or neglect their assignments . At most , Lake slept three hours per night for months . Major Teesdale and Captain Thompson commanded Ottoman battalions and artillery in their redoubts , built on the high ground surrounding the town . Thompson , a prolific writer , scribbled away on a nightly basis to keep from succumbing to tedium and apathy . While General Williams coordinated the various activities of his British and Turkish officers , Dr. Sandwith prepared the hospital for a serious Russian attempt to storm the works , which everyone expected to occur any day . Each man on Sandwith 's medical staff was provided with a civilian interpreter who assisted in giving commands to the Turkish officers and sometimes , in battle situations , also became involved in the fighting . At least one British officer learned enough Turkish to converse with his subordinates , and in Ottoman fashion sat with his officers on a daily basis with " coffee and pipes , " making a review of the day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men . Thompson became very friendly with his officers and on occasion engaged in wrestling matches with his colonels and majors . Aside from a handful of skirmishes , few significant events occurred during the summer of 1855 . On or about July 1 , a Russian force seized stores of wheat , barley and biscuit in the village of Yen Ky depriving the Kars garrison and townspeople of a valuable food supply . Famine had begun to plague the outpost by July 17 , when Thompson reported that he had eaten only a slice of cold boiled beef and was left with a ravenous appetite for the rest of the day . On that same day , Williams discovered that the keeper of the main storehouse , Salih Aga , had grown rich on a black market in food by selling most of the provisions in , his inventory . Nothing remained to make the famous barley soup that Williams had noted in his many letters as being a staple of the Ottoman soldiers diet . The Laz infantry , which had no food supply , had enriched Salih @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like all other irregular troops in the Ottoman army , to find their own rations . By July 29 , the Laz were at the point of starvation and mutinied . But Williams stilled their insurrection at its inception by purchasing oxen with his own money and giving them to the Laz irregulars , thereby retaining them as garrison members . With the assistance of the Ottoman commander in chief , Williams also reorganized the entire rationing system and began keeping better records of food distribution . // Dr. Humphry Sandwith , portrayed by DJ . Pound , organized the military hospital at Kars , seeing to it that each member of the medical staff he headed was provided with an interpreter . // Ottoman soldiers began to sell their own rations to townspeople , who otherwise had to live on handouts or on the town 's animal population-dogs , cats and rats . Soldiers increasingly came into Sandwith 's hospital , and the hard-working surgeon reported that at least one soldier a day died of malnutrition or disease during this period . The Laz soon began looting outlying villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted some Laz freebooters , who drew their famous long knives , called kamas , on them . After severe fighting , the British officers had the Laz arrested and publicly flogged for insubordination and mutiny . Still , desertions increased , with soldiers of all types taking their chances at slipping through the Russian lines rather than face starvation . On August 7 , a Russian column made a frontal assault on Kanli Redoubt , but the attempt was repulsed , with about 250 Russians killed . Sandwith wrote that he considered it a " most stupid , inexplicable attack . " By mid-September , news that the Crimean port of Sevastopol had fallen to the allies reached the Kars garrison . Early in the morning of September 29 , Muraviev , fearing the prospect of being cut off from Russia proper , sent his entire infantry force to attack the redoubt held by Major Teesdale and General Kmety 's battalions . Muraviev hoped that the compounded problems of starvation and the onset of winter would prompt the Turkish troops to yield . The outcome of his gamble would serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-defended positions held by resolute soldiers . Three massive Russian columns formed for the assault and began to march forward at 4 a.m . Turkish sentries alerted their redoubt commanders of the Russian advance , and firing began around 4:30 . The Russians had intended to execute a surprise attack in the fog and weak light of dawn , but they failed . On October 3 , Williams wrote in a letter that the Russian soldier had " advanced with his usual steadiness and intrepidity , but in getting within range , he was saluted with a crushing fire of artillery from all points of the line : this unexpected reception , however , only drew forth hurrahs from the Russian infantry , as it rushed up the hill on the redoubts and breastworks . These works poured forth a fire of musketry and rifle , which told with fearful effect on the close columns of attack , more especially on the left one .... " The Russian force on the left broke and fled , leaving 850 men dead on the field . The Russian center column struck at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desperate fighting ensued over the next several hours . The Russians broke through the trenches on either side of the central redoubts but never succeeded in entering the redoubts themselves . As the apparently victorious Russians ran toward the city of Kars , some distance away , they were surprised by a flank attack by three Turkish infantry battalions , commanded by Colonel Lake . Thompson turned his artillery around on the heights he commanded , enfilading the charging Russian infantry . Teesdale , Kmety and other officers in the surrounded central redoubt led counterattacks and stolidly fought on . The combination of flank attack and artillery enfilade , as well as counterattacks by the men in the beleaguered positions , forced Russian survivors to retreat . Williams estimated the Russian central columns strength at 22 infantry battalions , a large cavalry force of dragoons and Cossacks , and 32 artillery pieces . He also noted that Kmety and Husain Pasha , a Turkish officer , distinguished themselves by their bravery , while Teesdale s valor during the action subsequently earned him the Victoria Cross . At 5:30 p.m. a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three artillery batteries assaulted the outlying trenches , called the " English redoubts . " The battles elsewhere had drawn some of the Turkish troops away from those positions . The Laz and other irregulars holding some part of those trenches fought bravely , but were thrown back . Seeing that loss , Williams ordered Thompson to send two Turkish infantry battalions from his redoubts to counterattack . Reinforced by Lakes three battalions , they drove the Russians from the trenches after severe hand-tohand fighting with bayonets and clubbed muskets . Even amid the fighting , the Turkish soldiers , who were lightly clothed , took the time to strip the Russian dead of their heavier garments-September was already very cold in Kars . After the Russians withdrew , Lake stated that his men buried 6,500 Russians , and Russian deserters claimed that an estimated 15,000 wounded filled their hospitals . The Russian infantry battalions had been totally crippled , but their cavalry maintained the siege . // Having driven the Turkish cavalry into the fortress , Russian cavalry and infantry make their first serious attempt to storm Kars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's guns and infantry at Karadagh ( Bettmann/Corbis ) . // Rumors of relief did not drive the Russians away and gave no optimism to Kars ' defenders . Their intrepidity was rewarded with negligence from the authorities in Istanbul and the Crimea , or so it seemed . Day after desperate day of unbroken siege passed . Cholera broke out , and 1,000 men died in October and November . Famine killed even more , among the soldiers as well as the townspeople . The women and children of Kars , who had once applauded Williams and his staff , now looked reproachfully upon them . Laz irregulars refused to go to the hospital to seek help from Dr. Sandwith ; as they neared death from starvation , they crawled into deserted houses to die . The defenders stood in their trenches and redoubts only through General Williams ' iron resolve . They did receive some encouraging news-the Russian-held Caucasus territories had been invaded by the Turkish commander in chief , Omer Pasha . They heard he had begun his march toward Kars , and that other Ottoman forces were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // With all hope of relief exhausted , Williams accepts General Mikhail Muraviev 's terms , in The Capitulation of Kars During the Crimean War on 28th November 1855 , by Thomas Jones Barker National Army Museum , London/ Bridgeman Art Library . // At the end of November , however , when famine and disease reached a critical point and no sign of relief was forthcoming , Williams decided to capitulate . Before the official surrender was made , he sent all Hungarian and Polish expatriates out into the night to make their way to safety if possible rather than face Russian captivity . Both Hungarians escaped , and Kollmann continued to serve in the Ottoman army ( under the Turkish name of Feyzi Bey ) during the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78 , fighting in the same army of eastern Anatolia as at Kars . Muraviev allowed only irregular Ottoman troops to return to their homes .

General Williams ' letters written during the campaign were published by the British government . Colonel Atwell Lake wrote two books-Kars and Our Captivity and Narrative of the Defence of Kars-and Dr. Sandwith described his travails in Narrative of the Siege of Kars , all published within two years of the Crimean War 's end . An anonymous pamphlet titled Kars and Its Defenders appeared in 1857 , naming Gyrgy Kmety as having played the most important role in the Ottoman garrisons ability to repulse the Russians for such a long time ; it is widely believed to have been written by Kmety himself .
