THE DARLING OF ROSEDALE <p> Once upon a time there was a little girl named Alice Green who lived on what people who do n't know any better would call a farm , but which her family called their country estate . Rosedale 's main house was not especially fine , a clapboard box with a center hall and , upstairs , a warren of bedrooms ( Alice shared one of the smallest with two sisters ) . However , it had fireplaces in every room , a gleaming piano in the parlor , and Hepplewhite-style chairs in the dining room . It was said that Pierre L'Enfant , who laid out the plan of the city of Washington , had advised with the landscaping . There were avenues of dogwood and ornamental hedges ; peach , pear , cherry , fig , and apple orchards , grape arbors , strawberry bushes , vegetable patches , including sensationally prolific asparagus beds . ( " O Moses , " Alice 's mother , Mrs. Green , would lament each spring with scarcely disguised pride . " What am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might also mention their chickens , ducks , geese , prize hogs , and feeding on the hilly pastures that here and there dropped down to the wooded canyon of Rock Creek , a herd of scrupulously tended milk cows . As was common in those days , the family owned slaves ; these had their dowdy little cabins out back behind the stables so as not to ruin the pleasing view from the main driveway . Rosedale crowned the heights above Georgetown , the nearly century-old tobacco port town that had been drawn into the western corner of the District of Columbia . From the dormer window of her bedroom , Alice could see hills undulating down for the few miles yonder to the one they called Rome , where the national capitol sat , then no more than a tooth of a building . To the south , below , lay the Potomac , with its jerry-built wharves and , shooting out from the foot of the Francis Scott Key house , the rickety-looking Aqueduct Bridge . On the opposite shore , in the blue distance : the chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields and forests of Virginia . Alas , oftentimes this vista was sullied by smoke from one of Georgetown 's paper mills or bone factories . <p> Rosedale had been founded by Alice 's maternal grandfather , General Uriah Forrest , who served with General Washington and , famously , lost a leg in the Battle of Brandywine . Her maternal grandmother was a Hater who grew up at Sotterley , one of the grandest of the Maryland Tidewater tobacco plantations . But so much had been lost by the time Alice was born : decades earlier , General Forrest had been bankrupted . As for Sotterley , the story went , it had slipped from a great-uncle 's fingers in a game of dice . <p> Alice 's father worked in an office in the city of Washington , but when he was a young man he had seen action in Tripoli with Commodore Decatur . Her father 's uniform was in his seaman 's trunk , a wooden box with handles made of rope , but impossible to lift . Alice and her brothers and sisters were allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous plume , and posing in front of the mirror . They could take out the rusty musket , and the saber too ( but they had to keep that in its sheath ) . There were a pair of high boots with cracked soles , yellowed breeches that had once been snow white , and a coat that smelled strongly of camphor but nonetheless was riddled with moth holes . <p> When she was seven years old , Alice knew : she loved uniforms . She wanted , with all her heart , to go to Tripoli . <p> " Girls do n't wear uniforms , " her older brother George said . <p> " Silly , " an older sister said , rolling her eyes . <p> " Saphead , " said another brother , Oseola , and he stuck out his tongue . <p> Thus was Alice persuaded to abandon her first ambition-but never the yearning for her destiny , which she felt as a blind girl might , laying a hand upon an elephant 's side : this huge , warm , breathing thing . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe it , only the dim but solid knowledge that it was altogether different and inconceivably grander than the others ' . <p> She , being the youngest of eight , had always felt small , but very special , and so this did not disconcert her . She took it as a given , as the color of the parlor 's sofa was a given , that while whites went in that parlor Negroes , except to dust and polish and serve tea , did not . What was to ponder in the fact that winter was bitter , and the summer steamy and buggy ? Whether it were clear or cloudy , the sun rose every day , and this included Sunday , which was the day Mr. and Mrs. Green and all the little Greens crammed themselves into the big carriage and drove down toward the Potomac and , to save their mortal souls , sat through mass ( no talking , no pinching ) at Georgetown 's Holy Trinity . <p> And then came finishing school . At the Georgetown Female Seminary , in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome and such , Alice studied geography . She was diligent and she had a knife-sharp memory . Shown the Sandwich Islands once , she could pick them out of the Pacific , cold . In the parlor her father had a gold-edged Atlas of the World . She would sometimes lie on her stomach on the carpet and , propped on her elbows , study , say , Australia . Chile . Iceland . North Africa . She loved to trace her finger along the ragged curve of the Barbary Coast until it landed on Tripoli . <p> Tripoli . Alice whispered the names of the Arab cities : Tangiers . Algiers . Tunis . Cairo . She would close her eyes and imagine the musky scents of their bazaars , the tables piled with bangles and silks , oranges sweet as the sun . Her father had explored ancient temples , ridden a real camel , and held in his own hands a two-thousand-year-old kylix painted with the figure of the Minotaur . He had seen Malta , Mallorca , Gibraltar . On the map Alice would touch each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aqua blue swath of paper that was the Atlantic . And then her finger would arrive at Chesapeake Bay , sliding up the sinuous Potomac to ... <p> Oh , Dullsvania . Blahsberg ! Boringopolis ! ! <p> She knew there was another life waiting for her , a life as romantic as anything out of The Thousand and One Nights . Here , in the country , it sometimes seemed that she had nothing to do but sit at the window , her chin in her hands , and watch crows alight on the fence-rails . ( Her mammy said that in the night the crows flew to Mexico , to feed on dead soldiers . In the day , they digested the flesh . But Alice knew better than to pay heed to Negro talk . ) Sometimes , early in the mornings before school , her mother made her help feed the chickens and inspect the dairy . Was that not the rudest thing in the world ? One day , she would wing across an ocean . She would be adored ; like Commodore Decatur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No : more than a hundred years . <p> After her fourteenth birthday , when she began to read her older sisters 's stash of novels , her daydreams became ever more baroque . Armor-clad knights on snow white steeds , damsels locked into sunless towers , Frankenstein , all class of ghoulish specters , and pirates , rakish lords and mined ladies , and the personal memoirs of the white slaves , victims of shipwrecks on the wild Mogador coast , sold into brutal servitude to Mohammedans , then rescued by the most dashing of British officers , titled gentlemen of the most polished minds and cultured sensibilities . Such were the stories that enchanted her for hours at a stretch . <p> She was the youngest and the prettiest of all her sisters . On the cusp of the bloom of her life , she seemed the bud of a most glorious rose . Her father , she believed , was rich-and he was until he was thrown from his horse . He seemed to be all right at first , just a bump on the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupor . He slept , he ate , he slept . He spoke very little . This went on for some weeks . And then , one morning in 1850 , he did not wake . <p> The subsequent decline in the family 's income meant that Alice 's dowry could not be so generous as some of her sisters ' had been . However , the fatherless girl grew up-it seemed to have happened overnight , her mother said-into a ravishing belle . She wore her fair hair in ringlets , and by biting them when she thought no one was looking she kept her lips plump and brightest pomegranate-red . Her teeth were a row of pearls ; her laugh , a pretty brook . She had sylph-like arms and such dewy skin that , though some other girls may have been blessed with more in the material sphere , she was sure of it , they were all jealous . <p> For Alice 's first winter , as the social season was called , her mother had four of her sisters ' gowns refitted for her by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lilac ribbons on the cuffs ; buttercup yellow silk with tulle and coral pink silk trim with three flounces of tulle ; ashes of roses moirT with a whale-boned bodice ; and , her favorite because it made her feel like a heroine out of Ivanhoe , Napoleon blue velvet with cap-sleeves and a scalloped train . She also had three wrappers ; a fan trimmed with Alenton lace and another with swan 's feathers ; a coral bracelet and a pearl rope-necklace ( her grandmother 's ) ; two adorable beaded bags ( one jet , one white ) , and four pairs of dancing slippers ( these not hand-me-downs but her very own ) , each dyed to match one of the gowns . In addition , four visiting toilettes : a suit of sky blue poult-de-soie embroidered in lavender ; one dove gray with slate gray braid ; another of the same but with beaver fur-trimmed collar and cuffs ; and one in jet , but the dramatic effect , which would have , as the mantua-maker pointed out , made her face pallid , was lightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bodice . <p> A winter in Washington ! As soon as they were old enough to put aside their dolls , this was what all the girls dreamed of : balls , receptions , concerts , opera , choice little dinner parties , skating parties , jaunts to the capitol , gatherings ... Come May , they liked to say , a belle just might find herself with an engagement ring on her finger . <p> Her mammy clapped her hands at the sight of her . " Miz Alice ! Fo ' de Lawd ' sake ! " <p> Alice , too , admired herself in the full-length mirror . Her eyes gleamed like wet hyacinths . One of her ringlets , soft as silk , rested on her collarbone . With two fingers she lifted it and tossed it behind her shoulder . She bit her lips , hard , to bring out their color . She brought her hands to her waist , pinched by the corset into the narrowest of " v " s . The corset , she was delighted to note , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She rose up on her toes , and then down , to see how her hoopskirt would bounce as she danced . Thanks to insisting on shoes a size too small , she had the daintiest feet . The daintiest of all of her sisters ' . Indeed , the daintiest of all her classmates ' at the Georgetown Female Seminary . <p> " What do you think ? " she asked her mammy . " In my hair , shall I wear the japonica or the silk rosette ? " It was a pomegranate-red rosette , more suitable for the decolletage of a dowager actress . <p> The stout mammy , whose woolly hair was covered with a calico bandana , pointed to the japonica . <p> Alice plucked up the silk rosette . " This one . " <p> A sister laughed condescendingly . " Alice , you are de trop . " <p> * * * <p> With the greatest of ease Miss Alice Green navigated the social whirl . From her very first formal ball , she was enchanted by the pressing crowds-among them cabinet ministers ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dinner jacket ! Senators and their attaches , army colonels , generals , corporals , their chests flashing with decorations for valor in the Mexican conflict . And above all , her heart would flutter at the sight of the men of the diplomatic corps-or , as a belle from the Georgetown Female Seminary properly referred to them , le corps diplomatique . They had the most beguiling uniforms-gold lace , gold buttons on crimson coats , or tunics as black as onyx , all with elaborate embroidery and froggings , hats trimmed with feathers , chests bespangled with exotic decorations . There was the inestimable Baron de Bodisco , ambassador of the czar , and his lovely , still youthful wife , nTe Harriet Beall Williams , of Georgetown . It was not uncommon for a belle , through this avenue , to marry into aristocracy . There were well-known examples such as Miss Gabriela Chapman of Virginia who had married the Marquis de Potestad Fornari of the Spanish legation . <p> " Eet iza mya pleazure , " said the minister from Sardinia , as he kissed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counts , Spaniards , Italian chevaliers , Frenchmen with mustaches waxed into daggers , Danes , English lords , Swedes , and even Turks . The Turkish admiral ! A gentleman to behold : he wore a turban with a diamond and jeweled crescent , the most luscious robes , a dagger studded with precious stones , a scimitar on his belt , and slippers with toes that curled up into points . He looked all the part ( the belle had to agree with the army corporal she was waltzing with ) of a genie out of Ali Baba 's cave . <p> There was much hand kissing , wafts of perfume , blasts and trills of music , and always , the Negroes weaving their way among the guests with trays of flutes of champagne , or rum punches , platters of the recherchT tidbits concocted by the most fashionable restaurateurs . The decorations : pink candle shades , spun-sugar swans , banks of hothouse lilies , poinsettias , heliotropes , red , white , and blue bunting , potted palms and profusions of ferns , and on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than four dozen lemon trees ( whose fruits turned out to be-on the sly , Alice squeezed one-papier mGchT ) . <p> Her dance card was invariably filled . She had been taught that a young lady should be demure ; nonetheless , in the mirrors , she boldly watched the others watching her-one of the French attaches in particular , an adder-eyed count with slicked-back hair and a mole on the side of his nose . He never asked her for a dance , but she had to be careful not to look at him because then their eyes would lock . Always , she felt her mother 's watchful gaze from the sofa , the inevitable sofa in the back of the room where , crowded like sparrows onto a telegraph wire , the mothers sat together , her own mother in black widow 's crOpe and the drabbest paisley shawl . <p> After dancing , breathless and flushed , fanning herself ( and hoping the elegance of her Alenton lace fan would be noticed ; it was comme il faut ) , Alice would make her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball , an Annapolis middy she had danced with twice before came up behind her . <p> " Miss Green ? " <p> His Adam 's apple seemed to have a life of its own . He simply stood there , breathing . His face , which could not be said to be that of a Romeo , was beaded with sweat . His name had quite gone out of her head . <p> " Miss Green , would you do me the honor of dancing this waltz ? " <p> She had blisters on both heels . As it was , it would be a supreme effort not to be seen limping on her way back to the table where her sisters and their beaux were waiting for her . Already , she had turned down three would-be gallants . She decided to be freezingly polite : " No thank you , I 'm quite tired . " She turned back to the cavalcade of cakes and petit fours and puddings . <p> " Miss Green ? " This specimen was a barnacle of tenacity . <p> She finished serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jostled her from the left . She let out a peeved sigh . <p> " Miss Green , " he insisted , " may I call on you at Rosedale ? " <p> She almost blurted , yes , but-is n't it better just to be honest ? - she said , " No . " <p> The poor boy looked as if he had taken a cannonball in the gut . She was sorry . But not really . <p> Oh , the clod-footed boys . The ones with pimples on their necks and sweaty gloves . Annapolis middies , low-down-the-totem-pole army types , law clerks , a dry goods merchant 's son ... Why were these the ones who asked to put their names on her dance card ? As Alice danced the mazurkas and quadrilles and waltzes , the air would grow uncomfortably warm , the whalebones in her corset would rub under her arms , the pins in her hair come loose , and her too-small slippers would rub her heels raw-for this ? <p> And it provoked her to tears that other girls lived right in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on Pennsylvania Avenue , or Georgetown , whilst she and her sisters had to make the miles-long slog back up the dark road to Rosedale . In inclement weather , this was cruelty to the horses , her mother would sigh . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
