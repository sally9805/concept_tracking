The first director of the great library of Alexandria was a very smart man , and we all owe him a big debt of gratitude . When he showed up for work on his first day  --  that was around 300 B.C.  --  he realized he had 500,000 papyrus scrolls and no way to organize them . He had stumbled on an important truth : You can have more information at your fingertips than any other human being in history , but it wo n't do you much good if you ca n't find the piece you want . He solved the problem by ordering the scrolls alphabetically , a principle that survives to this day . Too bad his name was Zenodotus . <P> Today we 're all Zenodotuses . Each of us has access to more data than anybody has ever had before , but still the trick is to find what we want when we want it . Given the size of the Internet  --  estimates run around 500 billion documents and counting  --  that 's no easy task . Internet surfers do about 550 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere doing anything and somebody is going to try to sell them something . The market for advertising to those Web searchers is worth about $2 billion , and it 's growing at a rate of 35% a year  --  far outpacing any other advertising medium . What 's more , Google , the reigning sultan of search , is looking vulnerable . The combination of big money and big opportunity has attracted some mighty big players , including Microsoft , Yahoo and Amazon . There 's a street fight brewing over Internet search that will make the browser wars look like thumb wrestling . <P> But for a minute forget about the big numbers , the millions of customers and the billions of dollars . Think about what 's at stake culturally and socially in the search wars , and all those zeros start looking pretty paltry by comparison . The Internet is swiftly becoming the primary repository of the bulk of human information . Search is the way we get at that information , and companies like Google wield enormous power . They reflect our common interests and shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . This is n't just about dotcom juggernauts duking it out for stock options and bragging rights . Whoever wins the search wars owns the keys to the kingdom of knowledge . That 's a big responsibility . Are search engines up to it ? <P> It 's kind of surprising to think that for most of the 1990s , very large corporations fought for the privilege of helping us search the Web . After all , there was no money in it , at least not directly  --  searching is free . Everybody assumed that one day somebody would figure out a way to reap dollars from it . But what 's even more surprising is that the first round of the search wars was won by two twentysomething Stanford graduate students named Sergey Brin and Larry Page . In 1998 Brin and Page invented a new kind of search engine , one that assessed the importance of a Web page based not on a simple keyword search but on how many and what kinds of websites link to that Web page . Their approach delivered search results that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a simple , quick-loading , no-frills format . It was a stone-cold category killer . Brin and Page called their search engine Google . " It was fun , it was short , it was reasonably easy to spell , " Page remembers . " We like doing big things , and googol the mathematical term for a 1 followed by 100 zeros is a huge number . "
