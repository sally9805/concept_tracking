IT 'S CALLED A BREAKUP BECAUSE IT 'S BROKEN // **29;752;TOOLONG AAAAAHHHHHHH ! F*#k , it hurts . It 's rocking the very core of your being . You never saw it coming . You knew this was going to happen . You were going to do it first . You only broke it off with him before he broke it off with you . You guys were supposed to be together forever . You never liked him that much anyway . He was such a great kisser . The sex was n't that great . You really liked his family . He hated your friends . You hated his shoes . You miss him soooooo much . There 's no doubt about it-breakups suck . And now here you are holding this stupid " Breakup Book " because , quite honestly , you 'd do anything not to feel like this and maybe this book will shed some light on what you 're going through . Maybe you 'll get some sleep tonight . Or stop sleeping all the time . // In these first few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one all-important truth that you need to recognize : Some things ca n't and should n't be fixed , especially that loser who dumped you or forced you to dump him . It 's over for a reason , and even if you 're in denial about it , deep down inside you probably know what that reason is . Even if you feel baffled by his decision to end it , it boils down to the same thing every time : Your relationship , despite its promise , has ceased to be right for one or both of you . It is , in effect , broken . That does n't make the breakup any easier to handle or change the overwhelming nature of the sadness that you feel . But that sadness , in turn , does n't make it less broken . If you 've reached this point , where one or both of you feel that walking away is the best course of action , the cracks are there . And starting today , you 're not the kind of woman who settles for broken or hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of shoes , or a relationship . Your life is not a yard sale . It 's time to get rid of all the broken stuff that you 've been lugging around for days , months , and maybe even years , and make the bold decision to start looking for stuff that works . The bright , clean , simple , easy , **52;783;TOOLONG kind of works . Being the first one to recognize that a relationship is n't a match does n't win you any great prize-just the guilt of having to hurt someone 's feelings . So even though you are clearly wounded , getting out of this broken relationship is the best thing possible , even if you did n't know it was broken until now . // " But some things can be fixed , " you say . True , but can your relationship be fixed ? Anything is possible , but we 'd say probably not . Generally , if one person thinks that the breakup is the right move , they 're probably right even if it feels so wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and getting down in the trenches with some duct tape and superglue and a fierce determination , it is n't going to happen . Need more convincing ? How about this : The person you loved took a good long look at the awesomeness that is you , evaluated your relationship together , and said , " No , thanks . I 'll try my luck elsewhere . " Or you said it to him . Either way , that alone should make you realize that it was n't a match made in heaven and they 're not worth donning coveralls for . Anyone who assesses you or your relationship as disposable is not worthy of your time or tears . // Right now , your mind is probably working overtime to come up with all the reasons that you should still be together . Your heart is hurting and your mind wants to find a way to undo the pain . Just remember , though , that any reasons you come up with are ultimately irrelevant . The harsh reality is that even if you have everything else in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the belief that this relationship can work . That , my friend , trumps your shared love of puppies , The Dave Matthews Band , and Mexican food . // It 's hard not to rack your brain , searching for reasons why the two of you could n't make it work , but sometimes the only real answer is the simplest one : People come together and move apart . It 's the age-old ebb and flow of relationships . Some are shorter journeys , and others were meant for a lifetime . That goes for friendships as well . We become attached to what 's familiar and sometimes we hold on to things that are safe and predictable even if they 're bad for us . A lot of the pain you are experiencing right now is actually fear . Fear of things being different than how you liked them , fear of never finding another love , fear of being alone , fear of having to fill your time differently . We 're afraid of the unknown . The answer to all the questions swirling in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet someone else ? - is " You wo n't know until you get there . " That 's hard , and it 's scary . But for the moment , you need to concentrate on what you do know-that you and he no longer share the belief that your relationship has a future . It 's broken , and the longer you stay stuck in a dead-end relationship or spend your days mourning one , the less time you get on this planet to experience a great one . // So take a deep breath , steel yourself , and realize that this is going to hurt for a while . There is no quick remedy for the powerful sting of heartbreak , though we 're going to try to make it easier for you throughout the book . You 're going to feel like crap head to toe and run the gamut of emotions . Edgy , moody , angry , depressed , nauseated-you name it . In fact , the amount of time it takes for you to start feeling great about yourself again is directly proportional to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who broke it off . Because at the end of the day , someone you loved , trusted , and valued has rejected you , and that really smarts . It 's hard to not take it personally . But- and here 's the important part-the fact of the matter is , they 're wrong about you . Just because your relationship is broken does n't mean you are ! No matter what happened between you , no matter what you may or may not have done wrong , you are still a kick-ass person . And even though you might not believe it right now , this breakup is the first step toward finding someone truly worthy of your greatness . // But Greg , I 've Got Questions // But how can a relationship just break with no warning ? // Dear Greg , // My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and have always had the perfect relationship . We moved in together last year and he started talking about getting married , having kids , the whole deal . He even took me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so naturally I assumed what would be under the Christmas tree for me . Since I thought I was getting an engagement ring , I maxed out my credit card to buy him a plasma TV for Christmas . Well , Christmas morning comes and he was shocked when he opened the plasma TV . But that was nothing compared to the shock when I opened his gift-a cashmere sweater and a necklace ! What ? Then , the next day , he tells me he 's not sure " I 'm the one " and he thinks I should move out and we should take a break so he can figure some things out ! ! Now he 's got the apartment and the plasma TV that I 'll be paying off for the rest of my life . I 've tried to remind him of how good we were together and that getting married was his idea , but he just keeps apologizing and telling me he needs time apart . How can somebody go from wanting to marry you to not even wanting to talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him realize that we should be together ? // Please write back . // Marla // Dear Plasma Giver , // First of all , never buy a man a plasma TV until you 're married . ( My grandmother used to say that . ) A lot of men think once they have a plasma TV they do n't need a girlfriend . Sounds like your boyfriend 's one of them . The truth is that if he 's going to come to the conclusion that you guys should be together , he 's going do it on his own . There 's nothing you can do to make him want to be with you , and more important , want to marry you . One of the suckiest and most frustrating facts of life is that sometimes relationships just end , often without reason . I truly believe that sometimes both men and women simply run out of love , even when there was a lot of it in the beginning . What blows even more is that you were completely blindsided-even though the relationship was broken on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the same place emotionally . What a shitty new reality for you to get your head around now . But the sooner you do , the sooner you can get your head around this great new thought : HEY , SUPERFOX , YOU ARE HEADED SOMEWHERE FABULOUS AND THERE ARE GREAT POSSIBILITIES AHEAD . You should also let him know that the proper etiquette is that if a girl breaks off an engagement she should give back the ring . If a man breaks up with you , he should give back the TV. // But why did n't he just break up with me instead of making me do it ? // Dear Greg , // I 've been seeing this guy for about eight months . At first we were just hooking up , but then we started really dating , exclusively . We were practically living at each other 's houses , rarely spending even one night apart . He even gave me a drawer at his place and a toothbrush ! So a few weeks ago he started acting weird , and I asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along faster than he 'd anticipated , and that even though it freaked him out , he was really happy with the way things were going and cared about me more than he 'd expected to . I thought , Great ! Then he 's suddenly too tired to come over or has to get up early the next day so he does n't think I should spend the night . So we went back to only seeing each other a few nights a week . Not great . When he got really distant , I knew something was up , so I checked his e-mails on his Sidekick when he was in the bathroom . It was clear from all the e-mails between him and TamiLynn78 that he 'd been seeing someone else . So I confronted him about it and he did n't deny it , so I told him we were O.V.E.R . and stormed out of his apartment . Now , this is the part where he was supposed to come running after me-but he did n't ! He just let me go , and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? I really want him to want me back and feel remorse for hurting me . Is that too much to ask ? // Linda // Dear Yes It Is Too Much to Ask , // First of all , I think it 's great you checked his e-mails instead of talking to him . Sounds like you had a great , open , trusting relationship in which you dug around in his personal business while he cheated on you . Why did it have to end ? I 'm going to say this and it 's going to suck ( but understand where I 'm coming from ) . He broke up with you months ago and let you do the dirty work . It 's a weird , passive-aggressive trick that men have perfected for centuries . Chances are he did n't want to hurt your feelings , so he behaved in a way that would make you break up with him . I call this the " Backhanded Breakup . " Men ( and women ) have done it for years . Not only that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . What a scumbag ! I 'm sure he 's getting right on that remorse you were hoping for . The only thing he has done right is not contact you . You should gladly accept this radio silence because your relationship has been broken for a while , and get on with your grieving because you are moving on to something better . // But how do you know we 're not going to get back together ? // Dear Greg , // My boyfriend of three years and I decided to move in together about a month ago . In fact , it was his idea . Since he had the bigger place , we agreed that I 'd let go of my apartment and move in with him . Everything was perfect- we repainted in colors that we both liked and started figuring out what pieces of furniture we 'd keep when we merged our stuff . Then , the day before I 'm supposed to move , after I 've already given notice at my apartment and it 's been rented , he tells me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the one . " He thinks that living together is a mistake and a waste of time for the both of us because it only delays us " finding our destinies . " He 's an amazing person that I ca n't imagine living without , and I know that if he 's given a little more time he 'll realize that we are each other 's destiny . Great guys are n't a dime a dozen . And he obviously has really strong feelings for me if he wanted us to live together a few weeks ago ! Do n't you think I should be patient with him if I really believe that we 're meant to be together ? // Clarissa // Dear Destiny 's Child , // Maybe you huffed too many paint fumes , but he said the words you are " not the one . " That 's pretty conclusive as far as these things go , and despite the really awful timing , you 've got to admire the guy 's honesty . He did it to save you both more time and pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you do n't have to enjoy it , but you do need to hear it . I know this hurts like a motherf*#ker , but it 's going to keep hurting if you do n't accept that it 's over . Plus he used the word " destiny . " What kind of New Age bullshit is that ? People like to think they can control their destiny , but I think destiny is listening and seeing what 's really happening and then making the smart , albeit sometimes painful , decision to move forward without another person . If you guys are meant to be together , I 'm sure his third eye will let him know and then he 'll surely move mountains to win you back . But I know for a fact that waiting for someone who may not be coming and being in pain are not your destiny . So realize that it 's called a breakup because it 's broken- and move on . //                   @ @
