I WOKE UP . I CAME OUT of the guilt you are in when you sleep in the middle of the day . I had worked the graveyard shift at the slaughterhouse and got home that morning at seven . All night I had sat in my security guard 's glass booth listening to the hogs keening in the holding pens . My job was to log the big slat-sided rigs that brought in the hogs and the tankers that took the entrails away to be rendered for soap . Careful of the hot exhaust pipes , I jumped aboard the trucks to shout for names and numbers . <p> My nights were country tunes on a cheap radio , help-wanted ads and dog-eared college catalogs , and these thirty-second meetings . Climbing , raising my voice to the dark , tired faces in the cabs while the diesels grumbled , writing on a clipboard and then watching the great racks of lights labor uphill toward the pens and chutes and conveyors . The animals , which are more fragile than people suppose , arrived in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stink accumulated in the night with the buzzing of insects and the hum of the air conditioner and the heavy tug of the pistol and the coffee turning acid and the delicately lashed eyes of the hogs . All of these things I had laid to rest that morning gratefully . Now I woke up in the guilt . <p> Because the knocking was loud , I knew it was a stranger . People who knew me knew the landlady and did n't raise hell like that . It was hot , Florida hot , and I slept naked . I went to the bathroom to knot a towel around my waist . <p> My visitors were Larry Harper and Mona Wills . He came in awkwardly , scratching his arm . She seemed to tumble in behind the only things she had been known for at school , her large breasts . I had known Larry and Mona were in town , working , but had n't seen them . Seeing them or anyone else from the old life made explanations necessary . At ambition 's roll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was living underneath , just underneath , in the convenience of a dream , and I liked it that way . <p> Larry stood with his head hanging . Mona looked at my towel and cleared her throat . I went into the bedroom , pulled on last night 's clothes , and looked out the window . A new Buick was parked at the curb . When I came back decent , Larry said , " How you doing , Tom ? " He held out his big , pale hand to me . <p> He was tall and going slack at the gut , a reserve basketball player at our small college who had gone into the games when there was no hope , wearing a look of sadness-like a fireman who 'd been called too late , but doing his duty . He had the look now , and I remembered his long feet slapping along the boards in the company of harried secondstringers . Mona stared frankly at my tired face and drew the corners of her mouth in tight . She and Larry had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was too severe to be pretty and had n't known an innocent day in her life . " I 'm OK , " I said . " How are you ? " <p> I watched Mona , thinking she would make sense of this , but she looked away , and Larry lifted his head off his chest . " Eddie Kelleher killed himself today . " <p> Part of me was still in the dream and the guilt , and it felt like they had discovered me at something wrong . Together with this I put the thing Larry had just said , and all of it sat me down in one of the kitchenette chairs . <p> " When ? " I asked , buying time . <p> " Around three-thirty , just a while ago . " Larry scratched a pale cheek , looked at his finger . " He left a note . It was pinned to his shirt . " <p> Mona was standing at the window , opening the dusty curtain with a thumb and forefinger . Even the back of her blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . I had slept through Eddie Kelleher 's death . In my half-awakened state , it seemed to me that I should not have missed : such a thing . <p> " Yes , " Larry said . He was annoyed that I was so slow , but this was his duty . <p> " OK , " I said , rubbing the back of my neck . <p> They both frowned at me . What did I mean , " OK " ? I meant : What does this have to do with me ? I meant : You have jobs , lives , and you 're taking care of this . It has more to do with me than with you , and here you are . <p> I shook my head . " What about Carol ? She all right ? " <p> I had scored another stupidity with Mona , who slowly shook her head . " She 's going to stay with us for a while . " " With us " meant she and Larry lived together . I thought , Lucky Carol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " <p> She was right . I ought to know . <p> I did n't know Eddie well . But after we both left school , and all his friends quit him , we had spent some time together . We seemed to end up in the same places late at night when the barriers go down with the last drinks . I could see us very clearly , surprising each other in bars and bookstores , talking a little about old times at school . We always found we did n't know the same people . We always promised to get together and then met again by accident . <p> Eddie was a speed freak , a Methedrine addict . He used a needle . He dealt a little , just enough to keep him out of work , and he owned a gun . He had showed it to me once . <p> " What do you think of this ? " he 'd asked . I had picked him up hitchhiking on a country road , one of those hot , airless days you hate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reached into a backpack , and then the handgun was blue and wet-looking in his palm . His eyes glittered with evil fun and just a little of the " I do n't give a shit " sparkle you expect from people who carry guns in backpacks . <p> " Thirty-two ? " I asked , because it looked small and I did n't know much about handguns then , and because I wanted to sound like I did . It was months before my security-guard job . <p> " No . Eight . Smith &; Wesson . " He closed his hand around the grip . <p> " Where 'd you get it ? " <p> " Had it , " he said . We were leaving the country , coming into the city . <p> " Point it away , " I said . He was pointing it at me , and I could see the dull gray noses of the bullets in the cylinder . " What do you want with that , anyway ? " I asked . My eyes must have been hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated the premise of our flimsy friendship-that the world was evil fun , that we were night people , unaffiliated and living beyond disapproval . I had brought something to the surface , and we were n't doing that . <p> He turned to the open window . The wind rushed in on his face and whipped his long black hair into his , eyes . " I need it in my work , " he said . He slid down the seat , and I thought he looked afraid . Of what , I did n't know , and I just wrote it all off as methed-out bravado . <p> Mona was waiting , so I said , " Is there anything I can do ? " <p> Larry nodded vigorously . " Carol 's parents are coming tonight . They 'll be staying with her at our house . Could you put Mr. Kelleher up here ? " <p> I looked at the apartment . A single bed , a dresser , a kitchenette , a blistered linoleum floor that tarred your bare feet . Mr. Kelleher was Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess I can borrow a cot . " <p> They were ready to leave . <p> " We 'll let you know when he gets here , " Mona said . <p> I had the day to sleep if I wanted to , but I was sore awake . Every time I closed my eyes , I saw a gunshot with Eddie at both ends of it . In the image I conjured , the bullet just dreamt along . I could n't see it strike anything . I wondered what thought was marooned in the cold brain of Eddie 's corpse . Maybe it was a memory , and maybe he could n't live with it anymore , and maybe he had called it up and allowed it full brilliance there behind his closed eyes and then shot it dead . Then I thought : How do you know he used the gun ? <p> I brewed some coffee and wandered around drinking it , seeing the bullet , the one that would n't strike , traveling in darkness , lost . Then I saw my leather holster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove out to the range . The company I worked for required employees to shoot once a month , fifty rounds , or they considered you unfit for duty . They were very military , rent-a-cops covered with epaulets and patches . A collection of aging studs with the John Law complex . I went to the range hating the expense . Fifty rounds cost money I could have spent on other things . <p> And yes , this day it occurred to me that it was a little strange to go shoot a pistol . But I wanted to get shed of the picture I had conjured , see the bullet hit a paper target . <p> I heard it on the radio driving to Mona 's place . Young suicide ... known dealer ... police reports show ... survived by . At Mona 's I parked behind a new rental car . Before going in , I took off my badge and moved the pistol from its legal position on the seat to the felonious glove compartment . I got out , smoothing my shirt where the badge had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pekingese high up under her arm . The dog barked , making ripples in Mona 's chest . <p> " Come in , Tom , " she said . <p> She turned to the three people at the dining-room table . " This is Eddie 's friend , Tom . " <p> The word sounded strange . Eddie and I had never used it . They all looked at me-Larry , Carol , Eddie 's wife , and a middle-aged couple I took to be Carol 's parents . Their eyes offered me the complicity a friend of Eddie 's owned . They nodded : Yes , a dead man should have friends . I watched Carol , remembering the few times we had said hello in the library , the cafeteria at school . But she was n't seeing me . Her brown hair was lank and greasy . Her face and hands were the same wet red . <p> Her father , Mr. Trent , leaned across the table to shake my hand . He said , " And this is Mrs. Trent . " <p> " Marliss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaked eyemakeup , and costume pearls in a floral-print shirtwaist . She nodded to me and stroked Carol 's hair . Mr. Trent was round and bald and calm . His handshake was firm . The hand I gave him had gun oil on it . <p> There was n't a chair left , so I stood , shifting my weight from one foot to the other . Mona said , " Mr. Kelleher 's coming in a cab from the airport . You can take him over to your place . " Then she looked at Mrs. Trent , with whom she shared the burden of large bosoms . Her voice held a certain cold edge when she said , " It was kind of you to offer , Tom . " <p> Mrs. Trent nodded to me again . I mumbled something about it being the least I could do under the circumstances . Mona smiled . I remembered it now . They were all Pentecostals of some kind . Glossolalia had been Larry and Mona 's bond at school . Eddie had told me about Carol and religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started going to the stingy little church in the pine barrens out on the edge of town . She 'd always had a good voice , and she enjoyed singing in the choir . I remembered Eddie smiling one night in a bar , looking a little like Mick Jagger with those big chalky teeth and the thick lips . " That choir , " he said , " they do a lot of stomping and clapping , you know ? Carol likes that shit now . " <p> Silence settled on us , and we sat in it freezing to death . All the senses failed us . We posed in our degrees of discomfort or fatigue or clumsiness . Finally , when I thought it would never end , I looked out through the parted curtains and saw a stooped little man paying off a Yellow Cab . He was leaning in through the window , which framed the narrow slope of his back , was poking change in his hand with a stiff forefinger . Here was the tenant of the bed that , under the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know why , but I warmed a little at the sight of him . He came up the walk wearing a cheap blue suit , black oxfords , and thick white socks . His narrow black tic was tucked in at the waist in the manner of a retired master sergeant . He was a hospital administrator , a missionary for the Moravian Church in Mexico . <p> After he was introduced around the room , I invited him home . He had brought only a dented plastic attach6 case . The striped waistband of a pair of jockey shorts was pinched in the latch . He followed me without asking a question . <p> That night I offered coffee , a sandwich , even conversation , but there seemed to be no need . Need ran very low in Mr. Kelleher . Dry was the word that kept coming to me . Cuernavaca dry . In the morning I watched him insert his thin , hairless limbs into the same wrinkled suit he had carefully hung up the night before . <p> We waited in the morning sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carol had rented an efficiency . The light seemed to fall like water through the branches of the big oak that shaded the house . I hated the idea of going in . Mr. Kelleher stood beside me , looking up at the gingerbread lattice under the eaves until Mr. Trent arrived in his rental car . <p> Mr. Trent looked refreshed as he led us up the stairs-the beneficiary of a good night 's sleep and a hearty breakfast . He walked briskly . " I 'll just look for some papers . " I felt some meaning attach to his taking charge . I could see that Mr. Kelleher was grateful . He said , " Certainly , " with a gentle courtesy . <p> I came up last , carrying two empty cardboard boxes I had picked up at a liquor store . At the landing , the two of them separated as though they had planned what they would do . Mr. Kelleher walked with his head down , hands clasped behind him in a deaconly way . He picked up a Cypress Gardens paperweight , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month 's dust . He lifted a conch shell from the mantel and turned it in his hands . Mr. Trent went straight to an old rolltop and began tugging at drawers . <p> I do n't know what I had expected to find . Maybe I thought the gore was still there , a fan of crusty black across the bed or in the bathtub . Something you could understand from the standpoint of its conforming to the physical laws of the universe . Muzzle velocity , angles of incidence and refraction , entry and exit . A bullet entering Eddie Kelleher 's mouth at an upward angle explodes the vault of his cranium and paints it on the white lace curtains behind the bed where Eddie sits in The Last Ineluctable , while the note he has pinned to his shirt collar flutters like a white leaf in all that red . And what do his lips say in the moment of final stupidity ? <p> Some people called the Good Samaritan Society had removed the evidence of the physical laws of the universe . I found their message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called them . They were a nonprofit public service , but would accept donations to be mailed in the envelope provided . <p> Mr. Trent had accumulated a small stack of insurance policies , certificates , and unpaid bills . His fingers went slowly and lightly through the drawers . He moved from one to the next as though reading Braille . Mr. Kelleher wandered like a shopper , picking things up and putting them down . I imagined him extracting a memory here , an anecdote there , reconstructing Eddie 's wedded life . Neither of them seemed in a hurry . I said nothing and waited to be told what to do . <p> Finally , Mr. Trent motioned me over with a nod . When he dropped the papers into the box I had brought , we heard Mr. Kelleher say , " Fantastic . " <p> He said it with a rising , priestly intonation . Maybe it was a glimpse of the fervid thing that sends a man to Mexico to heal for the Moravians . <p> " So many books , and he read them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bindings of a shelf of books . Then he took one down . " You can see here that he read them . " <p> He held the open book out to me , an underlined passage . He picked another and opened it . " Poetry , philosophy , history . " <p> " Yes , " I said , " Eddie was a big reader . " <p> He did n't seem to hear me . I stood by him while Mr. Trent piled papers in my box . Books were stacked on the tops of dressers and on the floor , and Mr. Kelleher began collecting them , examining the covers and turning them over in his hands as though each were a find . <p> " This one ... look at this , " he would say . Then he 'd pick it up , read the title , and say , emphatically , " Yes . " <p> He began putting books in the other box . He put them in neatly , big ones at the bottom , little ones next , and some turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to help arrange them . He said , " We 'll need twine and wrapping paper . " <p> I nodded , and we looked at each other . Our faces were close . He waved his hand between us the way you wave at smoke , then looked at the box as though it was not the right thing at all , and then he fell on the books , as terrible in his tears as job . And here they came , coursing and dripping , enough to make the flowers of Cuernavaca bloom . <p> Finally he raised his head , holding the sides of the box and peering into it , his fingers making wet prints in the cardboard . He whispered , " He read them all . " <p> Mr. Trent knelt beside us now . He pressed a knuckle to the cleft in his chin , cleared his throat , and said , " Edson . Edson , take hold of yourself . " <p> Mr. Trent held up some of the papers for Mr. Kelleher to see . We helped him stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling a handkerchief from his breast pocket and angrily punching at his eyes . His voice had firmed , but there were sudden , purple bruises under his eyes . He shook his head and sat down . After a time he looked at me sternly . <p> " You read a lot of books ? " <p> " Not as many as Eddie , " I said . <p> He nodded . Maybe it helped that I did n't read . Eddie had looked for answers in books ; maybe he had found the bullet and the note in one of these-a French novel , a Russian autobiography-that Mr. Kelleher was keeping . <p> Then Mr. Trent said , " Here they are . " He held up two folded green envelopes , and his eyes shone . <p> " What ? " asked Mr. Kelleher . <p> " The stock certificates . " <p> Mr. Kelleher brightened then . He was interested . <p> Mr. Trent sat down next to him , leaning forward like a salesman , or someone telling a secret . <p> " Carol had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . just to teach her responsibility . " <p> Mr. Kelleher said , " She was a very responsible girl . " <p> " Is , " said Mr. Trent . <p> " Yes , " said Mr. Kelleher . <p> Then Mr. Trent seemed to regret the correction he had made . He frowned and said , " She can go to see her brother in Indiana for a while . " <p> They both leaned back then , as though the bargain had not been struck . I picked up the boxes and started for the door with the two of them following me . Mr. Kelleher stopped on the landing . He pointed back into the room , a place near the window . <p> " He did it right over there , " he said . " The policeman told me . Very clean . With towels and newspapers on the floor . Did you know ? " <p> " No , " I said . <p> Then he had an idea . <p> " Let me ask you , " he said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote poetry , but he never showed me any of it . " He turned back to the books in the box I held . " Why did they take it ? " <p> " Who ? " I asked . " Who confiscated . . . ? " <p> " Who ? " He had lost the thread . <p> " Who confiscated ? " I asked . <p> " The police . They said . . . " <p> I did n't want to tell him , but I did . I told him about the syringe , the cooker , and a length of surgical tubing to make the artery bulge out . Eddie 's works . When he heard it , he nodded and his knees sagged . Mr. Trent was holding the door for us . I put my hand on Mr. Kelleher 's shoulder to say come on . <p> We rose early the next morning . In the small apartment it was hard , even for Mr. Kelleher , who was as quiet as time passing , not to wake me . I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary but not good . Then he asked me about Eddie . " What was he like in school ? " We were facing each other across the plastic dinette table . <p> What could I tell him ? That Eddie had been king of the freaks ? The first one to do needle drugs ? A leader of the peace movement ? Sophomore year , that was ' 68 , he went to Berkeley on a special research grant . People I knew got letters , and in one there was a newspaper photo of Eddie standing at the barricade . In the slaty picture , his face was unmistakable , his mouth stretched wide around a slogan . His hand was stiff above his head , blurred in the smoke , and it held something . We stood crowded around a table in the student union with the picture pressed to the tabletop , and one guy , an art major , said , " That 's him all right . He looks like Liberty without the tits . " <p> I did n't know the reference to Delacroix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I saw the rocks and bottles hanging above the street and the cops behind their plastic shields , and had the presentiment that something was coming , even to our college in the sleepy South . Eddie was bringing it back with him . <p> I told Mr. Kelleher the good things I could remember about Eddie , the poetry he had published in the campus magazine , the acting he had done , the guitar he had played better than most . He listened quietly , his hands folded on the tabletop . When I was finished , he thanked me . He seemed satisfied , and he seemed to know that I had left things out . <p> Then he said , " Eddie started using drugs when he was fourteen . He was bored in Cuernavaca . The school was n't very good . There were evil boys in the marketplace . We did the best we could for him , his mother and L " It sounded like a thing he had said before . <p> We dressed for the funeral together , which amounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before , and me , hoping for protective coloration among the Pentecostals , getting into an old gray suit and tie . <p> At the church , Mr. Kelleher went to stand with Mr. and Mrs. Trent , and I circulated , listening . There was a lot of talk , a lot of investigating , formal and otherwise . They were saying Eddie had sold his record collection to buy the gun , but I knew that was wrong . They were saying he 'd left two notes . One for Carol , full of things she would n't reveal , and the other paperclipped to his shirt : " My name is Eddie Kelleher . I live at 132 N. 6th St. My wife is Carol Kelleher . Please call her at 577-4320 , at work . Carol , I want to be burned . " <p> There was talk about why he had done it , why now . I knew why . One of the last times we saw each other in a bar , Eddie was shaking so badly that he rattled our booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nerves might recover in five years , if he stopped now . He had started stealing . He had stolen from me , and I did n't mind . He had stolen from Carol , and she did . <p> Just before the service began , Larry took me aside , put a big , freethrow palm on my shoulder , and asked me to take care of the music . He led me through a labyrinth of passages into a kind of holy of holies behind the pulpit where one wall was a bank of expensive sound equipment . Eddie had requested music . Would I handle the record player ? <p> I said yes , and that 's how I missed the service , but it was all right . I heard it , all the testifying , the rustle of clothing , and the sobs rising with the timbre of the preaching and falling in the pauses . I sat back in the little holy of holies with my fingers sweating , hoping I could put the stylus on the disc at the right place and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I brought the songs in on cue . The last was an old ' 60s tune , Richie Havens 's " Follow . " I could hear the silence , then the whispering it caused out there among the faithful who believed that Christ had walked after the Crucifixion , that a man had put his fingers into the wound . The lyrics seemed to me to be a message from Eddie to Carol . They said , " Follow me . " <p> After the service , we stood under the Australian pines , and it was hot with no wind . I kept away from the group crowded around Carol and looked for a chance to collect Mr. Kelleher and go . I heard a woman , leaving , say , " New shoes . It takes this for her to have new shoes . " She was a friend of Carol 's , a thin woman from the elementary school where Carol taught . She walked with an indignant chin raised , whispering bitterly to a man who touched the middle of her back , steering her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stayed away from the worst of the crying . I watched the two fathers . They stood to one side , looking useless and shabby , unable to share what was happening . Most of the people around Carol were young . Mr. Kelleher and Mr. Trent kept their distance the way clumsy people shy from delicate things in a gift shop . I imagined they had sat together while the preacher read the thing about Lazarus rising and my sweating hands waited to play the music . Now their faces were patient as the fervent Pentecostals took care of their own . <p> In my dream , the bullet had struck . I was going to clean up the mess . I needed water , a bucket , chemicals . I woke up standing at the sink . In the light from the streetlamp , I could see Mr. Kelleher sleeping with his mouth open . I stayed in the apartment for a while and then could n't anymore and went downstairs and out . It had turned cool , and the chill made me feel a little bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the gun . in the glove compartment , where I had left it . It was cold and oily , and I left the belt and holster and began walking . A dew had fallen , and down the street the gutters steamed into the night like buried chimneys . I walked in no particular direction , holding the gun against my thigh . <p> The gutter steam rose into my nostrils , and its smell was the warm , sweet , heavy smell of low places in the woods in summer . The smell whose source is usually something with its limbs shrunken to knotted cords and an evil grin on its face . I cocked the pistol and felt its electric transformation in my hand , then in my arm and down my right side . I raised it and pressed the cool steel zero to my temple . I was a seventydollar-a-week security guard at a sausage plant . All night I listened to hogs whine on the hot prod and the narrowing ramp . I did n't read . I tried not to think . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hand the pistol buzz burned into my temple , and I pressed harder and tightened the finger inside the trigger guard . I pressed , bent the bone at my temple . Inside , the matter was calm . Electricity was flowing ; chemicals converted this moment into a complex molecule-a memory of Eddie . <p> We were in my car , driving into the city . I had just picked him up hitchhiking , and he was showing me the .38 Smith &; Wesson , telling me the improbable story about how he needed it in his work . Eddie the drug dealer , Eddie the gangster . Eddie the tough guy who carried a pistol and did n't care if he had to use it . All of it bogus . Then he said something that had the reek and sanctity of truth . But first he cocked the pistol , reached over and dropped it in my lap , let it fall heavy between my legs . I took one hand off the wheel and laid it on the pistol , then lifted it by the barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You know something ? We do n't just keep running into each other , you and me . It 's our karma to see each other . We have to get together . Those shitty bars late at night . I have to be at the end of one of my shitty nights , shaking my silly ass off with these drugs , and you have to show up and watch me do it . Act like it does n't bother you . Act like it 's all right . It 's all preordained out there in the , you know , dharma , whatever they call it . " I must have been setting my jaw . Shaking my head . Smiling my yes-and-fuck-you smile . He said , " You 're a lot like me , Tom . You know that ? You 're just not catching on as fast as I am . You 're just taking your time about it . " <p> He had n't taken the cocked pistol from my extended hand , so I tossed it at him , keeping my eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in my calmest voice . " Onion gravy . " <p> He laughed . " You know I 'm right . A couple of bad cases like us finding each other out here on this road . In those shitty bars late at night . You know it . Do n't say you do n't know it . " The gun skidded once in the gutter , then made a great flat boom as though the concrete cover of the drain had been struck by a hammer . Then a faraway splash . <p> " Good-bye , son , " Mr. Kelleher said . I was putting him into a taxi for the airport . Wishing he had n't used that word . <p> " What will you do ? " I asked . <p> " I have only the rest of this year until retirement . " He pressed two fingers to his temple and looked up at the white summer sky . " After that , " he said , " I do n't know . " <p> " What will you do ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I had always done ? He was making me think about it . <p> " Go back and finish school , maybe , " I said . " I do n't know . " A picture of Eddie 's books came to me , of proof in his marginal notes that he had read them . Without the gun , I was n't a security guard anymore . <p> I said it again : " I do n't know what I 'll do . " <p> But I knew . Eddie had told me . <p>
