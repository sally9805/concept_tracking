1 . Whither Narratology ? <p> The histories and respective achievements of structuralist narratology and German contributions to narrative theory ( Erzhltheorie ) have recently become the subject of a controversy . While David Darby 's article " Form and Content : An Essay in the History of Narratology " pits classical narratology against the history of German narrative theory , arguing that narratology should be remodeled into a contextualist theory of interpretation , other narratologists have criticized both his presentation of German narrative theory and his suggestion that such a " contextualist narratology " necessarily requires the ill-defined concept of the implied author . Monika Fludernik has pointed out that German contributions to narrative studies are much broader and more varied than Darby 's essay suggests ( " History " ) . Tom Kindt and Hans-Harald Mller have taken Darby to task for failing to provide convincing reasons for his claims regarding the purported need for a change in narratology 's aims and for widening its research domain ( " Narratology " ) . <p> This controversy and the different accounts the participants have offered of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view of the light they shed on the complex developments and international ramifications of narratology . They also metonymically illustrate what is at stake in the current debates about the directions into which narratology is moving . Hardcore structuralist narratologists are very sceptical about several of the so-called " new narratologies " collected in David Herman 's recent volume Narratologies , suspecting that they will inevitably lead to a contamination that infects " pure " and " neutral " description with the taint of ideology and relativism . In contrast to the purists who want to make " the world safe for narratology , " as John Bender aptly put it ( " Making " ) , practitioners of the various postclassical narratologies intrepidly rush in where structuralists fear to tread . Whether or not they are fools in so doing may be an open question , but their work has arguably opened up productive lines of research . Nonetheless , one can not fail to notice that the question asked in the title of an illuminating collection of articles edited by Kindt and Muller ( What is Narratology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers . There no longer seems to be a consensus about either the main aims or objectives of narratology or about the extension of its research domains . Echoing Christine Brooke-Rose 's title " Whatever Happened to Narratology ? " one may at this stage well ask " Whither narratology ? " <p> Instead of reviewing these debates , providing yet another survey of recent developments in narratology , ( n1 ) or trying to act as arbiter of hostilities , the present essay pursues three more modest goals : to sketch out some of the premises and concepts of an applied cultural narratology that puts the analytical toolkit developed by narratology in the service of context-sensitive interpretations of novels , to provide a typological overview of new kinds of historical fiction partly based on narratological categories , and to indicate how the latter may be used in order to tease out the epistemological and ethical implications of what has come to be known as " historiographic metafiction . " I hope to show that cultural analyses and interpretations of narratives in general , and research on historiographic metafiction in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the categories provided by narratology . <p> Using historiographic metafiction as a case study for testing the usefulness of a new kind of cultural narratology , I would like to argue that such dichotomies as the one between " the uncontaminated fields of ' classical ' narratology " and the " contextualist dimensions of contemporary ' postclassical ' narratological scholarship " ( Darby , " Form and Context Revisited " 423 ) should not be exaggerated . They arguably present us with a set of false choices : between text and context , between form and content as well as form and context , between formalism and contextualism , between bottom-up analysis and top-down synthesis , and between " neutral " description and " ideological " evaluation . The problem with such binarisms is not so much the ingrained structuralist fear that the formalist and descriptivist paradigm will inevitably be polluted by the invasion of ideological concerns , as the failure of such rigid distinctions to do justice to the aims and complexities of textual analysis , interpretation , and cultural history . It is the attempt to address these complexities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contextualism , and to close the gap between narratological bottom-up analysis and cultural top-down synthesis that is the motivating and driving force behind the project of an applied cultural narratology that is sensitive to the cultural contexts and ideological and epistemological implications of narratives . <p> My project in this essay will be to argue that classical narratology and context-sensitive analyses and interpretations of narratives , despite their contrary theoretical and methodological assumptions , are not as incompatible as is suggested by their respective practitioners who tend to ignore , or violently attack , each other 's work . I will argue that the more narratological interpretative contextualization becomes , and the more culturally and historically oriented narratological analysis becomes , the better for both . An alliance between narratology and cultural history can open up productive new possibilities for the analysis of both the dialogic relationship between novels and their cultural contexts and the epistemological , historical , and cultural implications of narrative strategies . 2 . Premises and Concepts of an Applied Cultural Narratology <p> To present the outlines of what I have provisionally called an applied cultural narratology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I will make a modest attempt to intervene . When narratology was invented in the late 1960s , three of the things that were lost were context , cultural history , and interpretation . Although we have recently witnessed both a cultural turn and a great revival of interest in the study of narratives across various disciplines , narratology and context-sensitive interpretations of narratives still seem to be oceans apart . This holds especially true for classical narratology , whereas rhetorical approaches to narrative like those championed by James Phelan and some of the better-developed recent approaches in narrative theory  --  e.g. , feminist narratology  --  are much more interested in interpretative concerns . <p> From today 's vantage point , it definitely looks as though narratology has not only survived the challenges of poststructuralism , but has also developed in a number of interesting new directions . One of the reasons why narratology not only survived the onslaughts of deconstruction , but has recently risen like a phoenix from its ashes , is that the critical climate has become more and more receptive to genuine narratological concerns . Narratology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Currie 76 ) , from " the Revival of Narrative " ( Burke ) in historiography , and from the renewed interdisciplinary interest in storytelling , both as an object of study and as a mode of scholarly writing . Moreover , a number of wide-ranging changes or " turns " in literary and cultural theory have been conducive to fostering interest in both narratology and the cultural and historical significance of narratives . These complex changes in the theoretical and critical climate , which have been dubbed the " cultural turn , " " historical turn , " " anthropological turn , " " ethical turn , " and " narrative " or " narrativist turn , " have greatly increased interest in what Jerome Bruner called " The Narrative Construction of Reality . " The concomitant incorporation of new methodologies and widening of the scope of narrative theory has led to such a proliferation of new approaches that it seems perfectly justified to speak of a " narratological renaissance at this juncture " ( Herman , " Introduction " 2 ) , or of a " renaissance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Given the plethora of new narratological approaches , however , it seems no longer appropriate to talk about narratology as though it were a single approach or a monolithic discipline . As the programmatic and felicitous use of the plural  --  Narratologies  --  in the title of the collection of essays recently edited by David Herman indicates , there is no longer one capital " N " narratology . What was once a more or less unified structuralist enterprise has branched out into different directions and fields , producing a great diversity of new approaches , or " narratologies , " many of which display little if any resemblance to their formalist great-grandfather. ( n2 ) Some surveys of recent developments in narratology have tried to chart what has resulted from what Jackson Barry aptly called " Narratology 's Centrifugal Force . " Given the plethora of new approaches in narrative theory , many of which are as important as they are difficult to categorize , it seems wise to refrain from telling one particular story about the development(s) of and in narrative theory , the more so since any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countless possible plots " in a field that has recently turned into " a garden of forking paths " ( Onega and Landa 36 ) : <p> The actual evolution and development of narrative theory can not begin to be grafted onto the master narrative of critical theory as told by the poststructuralists . Indeed , the story of modern narrative theory does not fit well into the frame of any narrative history . There are far too many story strands , loose ends , abrupt turns , and unmotivated reappearances of forgotten figures and theoretical approaches to fit easily within any one narrative structure . The history of modern narrative theory is more accurately depicted as a cluster of contiguous histories rather than a single , comprehensive narrative . ( Richardson 172 ) <p> Instead of telling one particular story about narratology , ( n3 ) I have elsewhere tried to pinpoint the main differences between structuralist ( " classical " ) narratology and the new " postclassical narratologies " and to reassess and systematize recent developments in the field by providing a preliminary synchronous map of the plethora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into eight groups ( " Narratology , " " Towards " ) . ( n4 ) Most of the new narratologies have either resulted from modifications , elaborations , and applications of previous insights and models , or they have been produced by fruitful encounters between structuralist narratology and other theoretical approaches or critical schools , from which various features have been assimilated into narratology . In their bibliography , Fludernik and Brian Richardson divide recent work on narrative , by approach or emphasis , into ten groups : Structuralist and Linguistic Approaches ; Rhetorical , Bakhtinian , and Phenomenological Accounts ; New Interdisciplinary Approaches ; Postmodern Narratology ; Ideological Approaches ; Psychological Approaches ; Poststructuralist Approaches ; Popular Culture ; Asian Poetics ; and Important Anthologies . Heuristically useful as such a provisional classification no doubt is , the groups designated as " Structuralist and Linguistic Approaches " and " Rhetorical , Bakhtinian , and Phenomenological Accounts " would arguably deserve further subdivision , being much too heterogeneous to warrant calling the work subsumed under those all-too-wide umbrellas a " group , " whereas " Postmodern Narratology " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well lump them together . <p> Two of the results of the current diversification of approaches have been an increasing interest in the forms and functions of narratives within culture and a shift of attention towards the question of how narrative forms contribute to our understanding of such phenomena as gender , history , and subjectivity . While the mere systematic and formalist analysis of narrative , once the central point of narratology , has largely gone out of fashion , narrative theorists have begun to turn their attention to what Mieke Bal has called " cultural analysis " ( " Close Reading " ) . Many practitioners of such new approaches as feminist narratology , psychoanalytic narratology , or postcolonial narratology have begun to put the analytic tools of narratology " to the service of other concerns considered more vital for cultural studies , " as Bal put it in an article tellingly entitled " The Point of Narratology " ( 729 ) . Bal was the first narratologist to ask a question which sounds very simple , but which is actually as important as it is invaluable : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " new narratologies "  --  e.g. , feminist narratology and postcolonial narratology  --  have demonstrated what the point of narratology might be by applying its insights and categories to the analysis of a broad range of texts . Shifting its attention to the ways in which narrative forms function as an active cognitive force in the actual generation of attitudes , discourses , ideologies , values , and ways of thinking , cultural narratology focuses on what structuralist narratology ignored and left unanswered : viz. , the crucial question " of how literary production is engaged in the ongoing process of cultural construction " ( Bender , Imagining xv ) . For want of a better term , I have elsewhere suggested that one might call such an approach " cultural and historical narratology " ( " Towards " ) . The following suggestions are thus offered as a means to sketch  --  if yet in rough outline , at least in greater detail than previous uses of the term " cultural narratology " have displayed ( n5 )  --  some conceptual and methodological premises for a context-sensitive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> By applied cultural narratology I mean an integrated approach that puts the analytical tools provided by narratology to the service of a cultural analysis of narrative fictions . Focusing on " the study of narrative forms in their relationship to the culture which generates them " ( Onega and Landa 12 ) , cultural narratology explores " cultural experiences translated into , and meanings produced by , particular formal narratives practices " ( Helms 14 ) . Drawing upon the categories of narrative theory and new insights and research strategies developed in cultural history , such an approach can arguably shed light on both the semantic potential of narrative forms and the changing functions that narrative strategies have fulfilled . It is the task of such a project to contextualize literary fictions by situating them within the broader spectrum of discourses that constitute a given culture . It is time for narratology to catch up with the cultural turn in literary criticism and theory , but cultural studies and cultural history can also profit from drawing upon the analytical tools provided by narratology . As Bal poignantly observed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture " and " a cultural analysis of narratives " ( " Close " 39 ) . <p> The project of an applied cultural narratology is , of course , very much indebted to the various new narratologies that have recently emerged . It has most in common with the approaches subsumed under such headings as " Thematic Narratology " ( Fludernik , " Beyond " ) , " Contextualist and Thematic Narratologies " ( Chatman ; Nnning , " Towards " 351 ) or " Ideological Approaches " ( Fludernik and Richardson 319 ) . Gabriele Helms is certainly right though to emphasize that the term " cultural narratology " should clearly be set apart from what Seymour Chatman called " contextualist narratology , " by which he means approaches that focus exclusively on " the acts in the real world that generate literary narratives " ( 310 ) , and that it is important to emphasize that the project of a cultural narratology has " its roots in narratology " ( Helms 15 ) . Each of these new narratological approaches moves , in its own way , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various contexts . According to Herman , the differences between structuralist narratology and the new narratologies " point to a broader reconfiguration of the narratological landscape . The root transformation can be described as a shift from text-centered and formal models to models that are jointly formal and functional  --  models attentive both to the text and to the context of stories " ( " Introduction " 8 ) . <p> At the risk of oversimplification , one can attempt to provide a sketch of the parallel concerns that an applied cultural narratology shares with other new narratologies . Although the dichotomy between " classical narratology " and " postclassical narratologies " suggests unwarranted assumptions of homogeneity , and does not do justice to the diversity , breadth , and scope of the different approaches subsumed under the wide umbrellas of the two terms , it may serve to highlight some of the innovative trends that have recently emerged . First , the development of narratology has followed a course away from the systematic description of the properties of texts in the direction of a growing awareness of the complex interplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between textual features and the interpretive choices involved in the reading process . Second , classical narratology 's preference for describing textual elements within a structuralist paradigm has given way to a general " move toward integration and synthesis " ( Herman , " Introduction " 11 ) . <p> Proceeding from the assumption that an analysis of narrative forms can shed new light on the ideological and epistemological implications of narrative , cultural narratology strives to cross the border between textual formalism and historical contextualism , and to close the gaps between narratological bottom-up analysis and cultural top-down synthesis , putting the analytical toolkit developed by narratology to the service of context-sensitive interpretations of novels . Though the ubiquity of narratives makes it difficult to establish the boundaries of such a culture-oriented narratological project , it is possible to outline some of the conceptual and methodological consequences that it entails . First , though it leaves the narrow confines of structuralist taxonomy , it is informed by a critical practice that only the toolbox of classical narratology and the training in the precise semiotic analysis of narratives can provide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus arguably be foolish , a way of throwing the conceptual baby out with the formalist bathwater . As the controversy between Dorrit Cohn and John Bender in New Literary History ( 1995 ) has shown , it does make a difference whether we can establish a consensus about textual features or not , and it is the descriptive toolkit of narratology that provides us with the terminological categories needed as the basis for rational argument . <p> Second , questioning the traditional notion that the relationship between fiction and reality is based on mimesis , cultural narratology proceeds from the assumption that it is more rewarding to conceptualize narrative as an active force in its own right which is involved in the actual generation of ways of thinking and of attitudes and , thus , of something that stands behind historical developments . In his seminal work Imagining the Penitentiary , in which he argued that the widespread attitudes toward prison formulated in English fiction facilitated the conception of the eighteenth-century penitentiary . Bender sums up this new understanding of the active and constitutive role that fictions can play in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I consider literature and the visual arts as advanced forms of knowledge , as cognitive instruments that anticipate and contribute to institutional formation . Novels as I describe them are primary historical and ideological documents ; the vehicles , not the reflections , of social change . ( 1 ) <p> Conceptualizing narrative fictions as cognitive forces , cultural narratology explores the ways in which the formal properties of novels reflect , and influence , the unspoken mental assumptions and cultural issues of a given period . It focuses on the power of narrative fictions " to represent a medley of voices engaged in a conversation and/or a struggle for cultural space " ( Scholes 134 ) , Such problems as the relationship between the polyphonic structure of novels and their challenge to dominant cultural discourses require narratological tools for their description and analysis . It may be noted in passing that , despite two decades of intense reception of Mikhail Bakhtin 's works , his theory of dialogism , which has perhaps been hovering at the back of many narratologists ' minds for some time , has only recently been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Helms has convincingly demonstrated , the framework of a cultural narratology is arguably germane both to Bakhtin 's intense concern with social norms and values and also to his perceptive attempts to relate the dialogic structure of novels to the worldviews and ideologies of the societies from which they originated . Helms argues that the " term ' cultural narratology ' describes the place where dialogism and narrative theory meet , allowing the analysis of formal structures to be combined with a consideration of their ideological implications " ( 10 ) . In contrast to other narrative theorists who use the term " cultural narratology " without developing it . Helms is one of the first narratologists to provide a conceptual and methodological outline of a cultural narratology and to actually test its usefulness . <p> Such an approach implies , of course , that formal techniques are not just analyzed as structural features of a text , but as narrative modes that are highly semanticized and engaged in the process of cultural construction . As Helms emphasizes , " a cultural narratology would enable us to recognize that narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with content , and that dialogic relations in narrative structures are ideologically informed " ( 7 ) . In this respect the project of a cultural narratology can draw on Fredric Jameson 's concept of the " ideology of the form , " which implies that " form is immanently and intrinsically an ideology in its own right " : <p> What must now be stressed is that at this level " form " is apprehended as content . The study of the ideology of form is no doubt grounded on a technical and formalistic analysis in the narrower sense , even though , unlike much traditional formal analysis , it seeks to reveal the active presence within the text of a number of discontinuous and heterogeneous formal processes . But at the level of analysis in question here , a dialectical reversal has taken place in which it has become possible to grasp such formal processes as sedimented content in their own right , as carrying ideological messages of their own , distinct from the ostensible or manifest content of the works . ( Jameson 99 ) <p> If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any literary and cultural historian who wants to address ethical , ideological , or political issues raised in or by narratives can profit from the application of the toolbox that narratology provides . Context and form , content and narrative technique , are , after all , more closely intertwined than structuralist narratologists have tried to make us believe . It is not only the problem of the reception of literary character that inevitably draws critics ' attention to the interrelationship between ethics and aesthetics , but also key questions that postcolonial , feminist , and Afro-American studies are concerned with . Moreover , cultural and historical analyses of narratives require thicker descriptions than those offered by structuralist narratology , descriptions that take into account both thematic and formal features of texts and the ways in which epistemological , ethical , and social problems are articulated in the forms of narrative representations : " The political enters the study of English primarily through questions of representation : who is represented , who does the representing , who is object , who is subject  --  and how do these representations connect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sects , and nations ? " ( Scholes 153 ) . Such questions as who the subjects or objects of narrative representations are have always been genuine concerns of narratology , whose categories and models for the analysis of narratives provide useful tools for getting to grips with such issues . Key narratological concepts like focalization , unreliable narration , and narrative perspective have proven to be very fine descriptive tools that need to be applied to obtain insights considered vital for literary and cultural history . 3 . An Outline of a Narratological Typology and Poetics of Postmodernist Historical Fiction <p> Given the foregoing conceptual underpinnings , the next section is devoted to outlining some practical directions of research that the kind of cultural narratology delineated above opens up . The postmodernist genre of the historical novel that Linda Hutcheon christened " historiographic metafiction " ( Poetics 5 ) provides a particularly fruitful paradigm case for testing the usefulness of " a cultural-narratological approach " ( Helms 20 ) in that it is dialogically related to the cultural discourses of the last two decades and deeply involved in telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hegemonic cultural discourses by recontextualizing them and offering alternative versions , thus foregrounding epistemological and ethical questions involved in writing history ( see Kotte ) . Using historiographic metafiction as a case study , I will attempt to demonstrate that the analytical tools provided by " classical " narratology can be of great use for cultural analyses and context-sensitive interpretations of historiographic metafictions , and of course of other historical narratives , as well as for other concerns of contemporary " postclassical " narratologies , including generic categorization. ( n7 ) The narratological categories that are particularly helpful in the attempt to come to terms with the epistemological , historiographic , and ethical implications of postmodernist historical novels include the structure of narrative transmission , especially unreliable narration , and the notion of the perspectival structure of narrative texts ( see Nnning , Surkamp , and Zerweck ; Nnning and Nnning , ed. , Multiperspektivisches ) . <p> Various models have been proposed to account for the emergence of new , postmodernist kinds of historical fiction which have resulted from the crossing of borders and the blurring of genres , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories into consideration. ( n8 ) What is more , criticism of postmodernist historical fiction has concentrated almost exclusively on " historiographic metafiction , " defined by Hutcheon as " those well-known and popular novels which are both intensely self-reflexive and yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages " ( Poetics 5 ) . Hutcheon argues that historiographic metafiction reflects that feature which has been the major focus of attention in most of the critical work on postmodernism , a self-conscious assessment of the status and function of narrative in literature , history , and theory : " its theoretical self-awareness of history and fiction as human constructs ( histonographic metafiction ) is made the grounds for its rethinking and reworking of the forms and contents of the past " ( 5 ) . <p> Valuable though Hutcheon 's influential model is for its convincing demonstration of the degree to which historiographic metafiction has contributed to postmodernist fiction , her claim that the two are synonymous , that historiographic metafiction " defines postmodernism " ( 52 ) , seems unjustified . The identification of postmodernism with historiographic metafiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do justice to the diversity and scope of innovative developments in postmodernist fiction , let alone in other genres or arts . Moreover , the story Hutcheon tells about historiographic metafiction as defining postmodernism sounds tike yet another master narrative , and it is by no means the only , or arguably even the best story , but merely one of several competing narratives about postmodernism . <p> Being located on the border between historiography and literature , fact and fiction , postmodernist historical fiction shows a pronounced tendency to cross boundaries and to blur genre distinctions . Yet the ways in which genre conventions are blurred in contemporary fiction are so multifarious that it does not make much sense to subsume all the novels in question under one label , be it historiographic metafiction or " the postmodernist revisionist historical novel " ( McHale , Postmodernist 90 ) , Brian McHale 's shrewd constructivist observation that " if literary-historical ' objects ' such as postmodernism are constructed , not given or found , then the issue of how such objects are constructed . becomes crucial " ( Constructing 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narratological typology and poetics of postmodernist historical fiction . Given the great number of differences in themes and techniques that appear in postmodernist historical fiction , a typology is needed that takes into account both the thematic innovations and the narrative devices that distinguish different kinds of this subgenre from one another . <p> For that purpose , I have elsewhere developed a typology and poetics of historical fiction based on five sets of narratological parameters. ( n9 ) <p>  --  The structure of thematic selection , the incorporation of facts into fiction , and the relations between the different directions of reference ( intratextual reference , self-reference , intertextual reference , textualized extratextual reference ) , <p>  --  The various levels of narrative communication ( i.e. , the diegetic level of the story , the extradiegetic level of narrative transmission , hypo- or metatextual levels , the paratextual level ) on which history is thematized and structurally incorporated . <p>  --  The narratological categories describing the time structure , the various narrative modes , and the structure of narrative transmission that different kinds of historical fiction typically display . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical novels and the " official " historical record that historiography has established . <p>  --  The different kinds of available historical fiction , defined on the basis of the question of whether and to what degree the fictional illusion is maintained and fostered or undermined and destroyed , and on the basis of the various functions that different variants of historical fiction typically fulfil . <p> The application of these narratological criteria yields more differentiated and systematic possibilities of typological classification than those achieved using previous models . On the basis of the five sets of parameters , traditional as well as innovative postmodernist manifestations of the historical novel can be organized under a limited number of typological rubrics. ( n10 ) I have suggested designating them " documentary historical novels , " " realist historical novels , " " revisionist historical novels , " " metahistorical novels , " and implicit and explicit forms of " historiographic metafiction . " Documentary historical novels tend to foreground the conventionally backgrounded factual world . Traditional or realist historical novels , by contrast , foreground a fictitious plot against the backdrop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the realist historical novel also belong to the group of generic hybrids that integrate fictional and factual materials , it is the other three types that concern me here . <p> Revisionist historical novels rewrite history , but in contrast to historiographic metafiction they lack elements that break the aesthetic illusion and thus foreground the fictionality of a text . The postmodernist historical novel , according to McHale , is revisionist in two senses : " First , it revises the content of the historical record , reinterpreting the historical record , often demystifying or debunking the orthodox version of the past . Secondly , it revises , indeed transforms , the conventions and norms of historical fiction itself ( Postmodernist 90 ) . It often does so by violating one or even all of the constraints on the insertion of reality references that realist fiction adheres to according to McHale : " the ' dark areas ' constraint , " " a constraint on anachronism , " and the postulate that the " fictional world obeys real-world physics and logic " ( 87-88 ) . In contrast to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seam between invention and presumed historical reality . <p> So far as the content is concerned , revisionist historical novels have extended the conventional boundaries of the realist historical novel in significant ways . They have increasingly incorporated those thematic domains dealt with by the history of mentalities , women 's history , oral history , history from below , and the history of everyday life ( Alltagsgeschichte ) . Revisionist historical novels are inspired by the wish to rewrite history , particularly from the point of view of those all too long ignored by traditional historiography , and to offer alternative histories . They often do so by relying heavily on multiple internal focalization , adopting the points of view of several character-focalizers whose limited perspectives project highly subjective views of history . These narrative strategies are not an end in themselves but rather serve as a means to challenge both hegemonic historiographic discourses and the generic conventions of the realist historical novel . An important correlated innovation in contemporary British historical fiction is the tendency toward marginalizing the great events of history and highlighting instead the experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the peripheral figures of fictional history " ( Hutcheon , Poetics 114 ) , revisionist historical novels present " a decentered view of history " ( Scanlan 10 ) . James Gordon Farrell 's historical novels , which focus on the perception of historical events in the minds of ordinary characters , provide typical examples of how this revaluation and inversion of centre and periphery is achieved by adopting particular narrative strategies . Farrell 's Troubles ( 1970 ) and The Siege of Krishnapur ( 1973 ) debunk a wide range of clichs about imperialism by providing miniature versions of key episodes involved in the decline of the British Empire . <p> The revisionist impact of Farrell 's novels depends not just on the level of the content , however , but even more so on their narrative strategies , which serve to underscore the decentered view of history that his works present . In Farrell 's fictional explorations of Britain 's imperial past , such narratological devices as internal focalization , the time-structure of his novels , the semanticization of material possessions , the use of illness and disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes , and beliefs undermine the ideological justification of the British mission . Farrell 's novels criticize the values and unspoken assumptions that stand behind the British Empire , laying bare " the fiction of happy natives being led forward along the road to civilization " ( Siege 225 ) . A similar revisionist impact can be found in the novels of Paul Scott , William Boyd , and Isabel Colegate . The revisionist historical novels of these authors tend to make historical events and persons peripheral to a fictional plot and to focus on everyday aspects of past reality . According to Margaret Scanlan , such historical novels " generally present history in the decentered manner we can associate with the history of mentalities . Well-known personages , and the attendant idea that great men ( or , rarely , women ) make history are conspicuously absent " ( 10 ) . <p> The revisionist impulse to rewrite history from the point of view of those traditional historiography tended to ignore becomes particularly apparent in some historical novels by female authors who deploy narrative devices like internal focalization and multiplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like other recent women 's historical fiction , Pat Barker 's The Century 's Daughter ( 1986 ) and Zo Fairbairns 's family chronicle Stand we at last ( 1983 ) attempt to supplement those incomplete and partial accounts of the past that ignore the viewpoints and roles of women . Instead of contenting themselves with reconstructing specific areas of women 's history , these novels exemplify a specifically feminist approach to history , politics , and historiography . Eva Figes and Jeanette Winterson combine a feminist concern with the rewriting of history with the use of experimental postmodern narrative techniques . Figes 's The Seven Ages ( 1987 ) takes into account political and military events only insofar as they affect the lives of women . The feminist politics of the novel is also enhanced by the plotlessness , the de-individualization of the female narrators and characters , and the emphasis on cyclical time-structures and on the importance of oral history as a means of transmitting female experience from one generation to the next . Winterson 's surrealist novel Sexing the Cherry ( 1989 ) uses fantastic and grotesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Puritan Revolution and a gargantuan female protagonist . Approaching the past from a feminist point of view , these revisionist historical novels polemicize not only about the discrimination against women in former periods , but also about the erasure of women from the historical record . Many such revisionist historical novels incorporate hitherto neglected themes and explore new modes for the representation of history in fiction without displaying those features that according to Hutcheon define historiographic metafiction . <p> In some cases , revisionist historical interest manifests itself primarily on the levels of narrative technique and structure rather than content . The innovative type of historical fiction that Barbara Foley has labelled " metahistorical novels " ( 25,186 ) explores , revises , and transforms the formal conventions of the traditional historical novel . In contrast to historiographic metafiction , which addresses problems related to the writing of history through explicit metafictional comments , metahistorical novels focus on the continuity of the past in the present , on the interplay between different time-levels , on forms of historical consciousness , and on the recuperation of history : " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place in the past , but focuses on the ways in which these events are grasped and explained in retrospect " ( Wesseling 90 ) . <p> Metahistorical novels represent significant innovations in the treatment of history as a literary theme because what they highlight is the process of historical reconstruction and the protagonists ' consciousness of the past rather than a represented historical world as such . Instead of portraying a historical world on the diegetic level of the characters , metahistorical novels are generally set in the present but concerned with the appropriation , revision , and transmission of history . Largely focusing on the representation of consciousness and perception , on what Monika Fludernik has called " experientiality " ( Towards 12-13 , 28-30 ) , metahistorical novels typically explore how characters try to come to terms with the past . Metahistorical novels do not portray the past as a self-contained and complete world , but as liable to the distortions that subjective reconstructions and recollections entail . The relationship of history to the present is an important factor underlying the complex narrative structure of such metahistorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chatterton ( 1987 ) and Barry Unsworth 's Stone Virgin ( 1985 ) , Sugar and Rum ( 1988 ) , and Losing Nelson ( 1999 ) . What is highlighted in these novels are the historiographical endeavors of the protagonists living in the present rather than the past itself . Ackroyd 's novels in particular establish a great number of thematic parallels between the different time levels which serve to link the past and the present . <p> Any discussion of the broad spectrum of postmodernist historical fiction would , of course , be incomplete if it did not take into consideration historiographic metafiction . This new subgenre thematizes and undermines the border between historiography and fiction , enquiring into the epistemological status of history and historiography . According to Hutcheon , whose definition is based on postmodern theories of architecture , the self-conscious reworking of documentary material in contemporary fiction is one of the defining characteristics of the postmodern , which " effects two simultaneous moves . It reinstalls historical contexts as significant and even determining , but in so doing , it problematizes the entire notion of historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both ( a reference to ) the " real " past world and a discursive construct , historiographic metafiction " differs substantially from the use of history in the traditional historical novel where history , as a group of facts which exists extratextually and which can be represented as it ' really was , ' is never in question " ( Lee 35 ) . <p> As I have shown elsewhere in greater detail , it would not only be useful to distinguish historiographic metafiction from the other kinds of postmodernist historical fiction discussed above , but also to differentiate between the various forms that historiographic metafiction itself  --  just like other types of metafiction  --  may take. ( n11 ) It may be explicit  --  that is , it may use the devices of metafiction to overtly thematize and explore the epistemological , methodological , and linguistic problems connected with any attempt to construct coherent accounts of the past . But historiographic metafiction may just as well be implicit , that is , may incorporate its metahistoriographic concerns formally in the structure of the novel . In either case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the epistemological problems attached to the reconstruction of historical events and the writing of history . <p> Implicit forms of historiographic metafiction are represented by those postmodernist historical novels whose complex structure and narrative techniques reflect the insights of modern theories of history . The polyphonic and fragmentary structure of John Fowles 's A Maggot ( 1985 ) , for instance , emphasizes the discrepancy between the real past and the remembered versions of that past , and between events and their written representations . The inability to grasp and narrate the complex processes that make up historical reality is implicitly exposed through the juxtaposition of different characters ' heterogeneous observations on the key events of the novel , which remain enigmatic . The multiplicity of perspectives and the montage of texts from different genres draw attention to the distorting effects of selecting sources , to the historian 's problem of having to rely on scanty evidence , to the partiality , contradictoriness , unreliability , and questionable authenticity of historical sources and documents , and to the close affinity between history and stories . The impossibility of synthesizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine the belief that historical processes can ever be objectively known . The randomly incompatible versions that the witnesses come up with in A Maggot illustrate that ( wo ) man 's models of history do not mirror any particular aspects of a past reality . The complexity of the narrative structure of the novel as well as the multiplicity of incompatible perspectives thus show that there is not one authentic representation of the past but a plurality of competing versions . Moreover , the novel highlights the fact that historians subjectively process the information they encounter in their sources . Similarly , the structure of Graham Swift 's Out of This World ( 1988 ) , in which four homodiegetic narrators present their versions of the history of both their family and of key events of the twentieth century , foregrounds unresolved contradictions between the different stories . The juxtaposition of four completely different perspectives implicitly questions the possibility of giving an objective account of history . A comparison of the different versions not only reveals the unavoidable subjectivity that lies behind the process of selecting , integrating , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts also shows that subjectivism inevitably undermines any pretension to historical truth and objectivity . Such postmodernist historical novels remind the reader that history , while it exists as a continuous collective process , is accessible to men and women only as a narrative produced by human beings who remember and interpret events from their particular points of view . The reader can compare the different individual and collective perspectives delineated in the novel with one another , but he or she can not compare any of these versions with what they are supposed to depict , that is , the enigmatic and contested events themselves . <p> As opposed to its implicit or structural variants , explicit forms of historiographic metafiction directly challenge the hegemonic discourses of historiography , overtly discussing epistemological and methodological problems of reconstructing the past . The self-conscious exploration of the recording of history and the challenging of such traditional historiographical assumptions as objectivity and the reliability of sources are the central concern and hallmark of explicit historiographic metafiction . With the benefit of hindsight , a good case might be made for Andrew Sinclair 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hybrid new genre , since Sinclair 's metafictional questioning of the conventions of historiography anticipates many of the concerns and narrative strategies that have been identified by Hutcheon and others as characteristics of historiographic metafiction . The three novels that make up Sinclair 's " Albion Triptych , " the surrealistic Gog , the relatively traditional and realistic Magog ( 1972 ) , and the highly experimental King Ludd ( 1988 ) , are at once a fictional history of English culture , an obsessive quest for personal as well as national identity , and an exploration of the nature of historical truth . The actual preoccupation of Sinclair 's Albion novels is not with England 's " real " past but with both problems of historical recuperation and a polyphonic cultural discourse made up of history and literature , of myth and legend . The overall effect is that the novels fuse the fictional present and England 's prehistoric , mythologized , and historical past , reinforcing a sense of the ubiquity of the past in the present . The historiographic critique implied in Gog is summed up in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gog realizes <p> that the past is the past and can not be checked . What is remembered is . Whether it were fact or fantasy , doing or dream , memory makes it history . And if there is evidence remaining from time gone , letters or documents or other witnesses , letters may be forged and documents may be untrustworthy and other witnesses may suffer from mass hallucinations . Each man carries his own past within his own skull . ( 175 ) <p> By drawing attention to the " process of turning events into facts , " " of turning the traces of the past . into historical representation " ( Hutcheon , Politics 57 ) , historiographic metafictions also thematize and cross other boundaries , e.g. , between history and writing , between fact and fiction , and between the real and the imaginary . Both the metafictional self-consciousness and the structure of such novels as Julian Barnes 's Flaubert 's Parraf ( 1984 ) , Penelope Lively 's City of the Mind ( 1991 ) , Nigel Williams 's Star Turn ( 1985 ) and Witchcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children ( 1981 ) foreground the paradoxical relation between history and writing . In Lively 's Moon Tiger some of the borders that postmodernist historical fiction typically crosses are thematized in one of the many metafictional comments on the novel 's very first page , where the narrator announces that she will present a " history of the world as selected by Claudia : fact and fiction , myth and evidence , images and documents " ( 1 ) , Through their complex structural layering of historical reconstruction and their metahistoriographic self-consciousness , the novels by Barnes , Lively , Rushdie , and Williams show that what is commonly regarded as an historical fact inevitably depends on the selective bias of the individual historian . By engaging with the question of how much we can ever know about the past , their novels not only call into doubt the notions of objectivity and truth , they also raise the question of how much we can ever know about the past . <p> This scepticism with regard to the human ability to acquire objective knowledge of the past is underlined in historiographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretive role of the historian , Rushdie 's Midnight 's Children is by now a famous case in point since it abounds in reflections about the selectivity and constructivity of memory and about the unbridgeable gulf that separates the present from the past as well as historiography from the events of the past . When Saleem Sinai , who calls himself " only the humblest of jugglers-with-facts " ( 326 ) , metaphorically characterizes his idiosyncratic approach to recuperating and narrating the past as " the chutnification of history ; the grand hope of the pickling of time " ( 459 ) , he is under no illusion that his " own personal version of history " ( 410 ) is exempt from the " inevitable distortions of the pickling process " ( 461 ) . The implication is that historiography is inevitably a process of subjective construction . <p> Another border that postmodernist historiographic metafiction explores , crosses , and undermines is that between fiction and historiography . This results not only in a blurring of the different generic conventions that these two types of narrative employ to represent past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One way of crossing the border between fiction and historiography is by closing the gap between history and stories . Graham Swift 's historical fictions could be described as novels about the recording of history because their structure and their metahistoriographic self-consciousness overtly bring to the fore the creative and interpretive role of the historian , who actively constructs rather than reconstructs history . Like many other postmodern historical fictions . Swift 's novels reject the omniscience of a third-person narrator by adopting the subjective voice of unreliable homodiegetic narrators or by juxtaposing various individual viewpoints . <p> Swift 's Waterland can be called a perfect specimen of the explicit variant of historiographic metafiction because it overtly exposes the impossibility of producing an objective , totalized , and true account of history . The high degree of metahistoriographic self-consciousness already indicates that the novel is deeply concerned with the ontological status of history and the epistemological problems of historiography . The definition used Swift uses as an epigraph immediately draws attention to Swift 's concern with the ambiguity of the term " history " : " Historia , ae , f. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a narrative of past events , history , b ) any kind of narrative : account , tale , story . " In the course of the novel , these different dimensions of history become more and more intertwined . The narrator 's metahistoriographic reflections , the emphasis that is put on the value of orally narrated stories rather than on written history , the historiographic equivalent of which is the recent interest in oral history , and the fact that history is presented in this novel by means of a series of highly unconventional stories that the history-teacher and narrator Tom Crick tells his pupils , all help to underscore the indispensable value of narrativity for the representation of history . George Landow 's poignant remark that Tom Crick " constructs history  --  his story " ( 199 ) corresponds to Crick 's crucial insight into the convergence between history and stories : " ' Perhaps history is just storytelling " ' ( Waterland 133 ) . Crick realizes that he can only give a highly fragmentary , biased , and personal view  --  that is , tell his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of history : " All there 'll be left to us will be stories . Stories will be our only reality " ( 257 ) . Yet Swift 's novel , with its pattern of cause and effect , does not conceal that narrativity inevitably imposes an artificial continuity and structure on history by endowing events with significance and situating them in a particular chronological sequence . Like many other narrators in historiographic metafictions . Crick seems to be aware of the fact that narrative , as the narrativist school of metahistorians has convincingly demonstrated , is not a transparent medium for representing historical reality but imposes a specific narrative shape on events . The metahistoriographic reflections lead to the conclusion that " events elude meaning " ( 122 ) and that man is a " story-telling animal " ( 53 ) who shapes his or her chaotic experiences into meaningful patterns by telling stories . These stories , which are motivated by the search for explanations , for answers to the question " Why ? " ( 122 ) , are in the final analysis not mimetic representations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such postmodernist historical fictions , then , is a pattern of retrospective projections . By juxtaposing a multiplicity of incompatible perspectives and by using unreliable narrators , the novels discussed suggest that there is not one truth about the past , only a series of versions which are dependent on and constructed by the observer rather than retrieved from the past . Despite the overt scepticism , however , it is not the factual existence of past events that the thematics and the structure of these novels call into question , but only human ability ever to know the true course of history . 4 . Promises of a Cultural Narratology : The Opening of Narratology to Cultural History <p> What 's the point , then , of an applied cultural narratology ? Cultural narratology recognizes that , since " ideology is located in narrative structures themselves , " analyses of the semanticization of narrative forms can shed light on unspoken assumptions , attitudes , and ideologies , as well as values and norms prevalent in any given text , genre and period ( Helms 14 ) . Once narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become valuable sources for cultural history and cultural studies because analyses of " their narrative forms provide information about ideological concepts and world views . " Helms has lucidly summarized the main reasons why a cultural narratology promises to be able to cross the border between narratology and cultural history and to bridge the gap that has so far separated the two disciplines ( to the detriment of both , one might add ) : <p> A cultural narratological framework holds two distinct promises : ( 1 ) the semanticizing of narrative forms will move narratology beyond its notorious a-historicity ; and ( 2 ) by providing adequate descriptive tools , it will enable cultural critics to attend to the specific tools and strategies that are characteristic of narratives in a wide range of media . ( 15 ) <p> What I hope to have shown is that narratology does indeed provide useful descriptive and analytical tools which enable literary and cultural critics to attend to both the specific narrative strategies that are characteristic of different kinds of postmodernist historical novels , and to the epistemological and ethical issues involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these novels . Rather than being an end in itself , the kind of cultural narratology conceptualized here can open up very fertile areas of investigation for literary and cultural history , provided , however , it leaves behind the self-imposed and hampering fetters that have prevented narratology all too long from dealing with questions that are relevant for a better understanding of the cultural dimensions of narratives and of literary and cultural history at large . Offering a preliminary and very skeletal sketch of an applied cultural narratology , I have tried to outline a few directions in which the cultural investigation of narrative forms can be pursued , but the bulk of the work that awaits a cultural narratology remains to be done . I should like to conclude by emphasizing once again that both the analytical toolbox provided by structuralist narratology and the new postclassical narratologies can be of great practical value to literary criticism , genre theory , and cultural history . However , it is high time that narratologists made more sustained efforts to contextualize the texts they subject to close scrutiny , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the usefulness of narratology " ( Bal , " Point " 729 ) , something that Helms , for instance , has convincingly done in her seminal cultural-narratological monograph Challenging Canada : Dialogism and Narrative Technique in Canadian Novels ( 2003 ) . ( n12 ) <p> The fact that the proliferation of new narratologies has been proceeding apace testifies to the current " return to narratology " ( Bal , " Close Reading " 19 , 39 ) , but it also shows that it is still too early to assess the usefulness and success of the various approaches recently developed . Given the widespread interest in the " narrative construction of reality " and the ubiquity as well as importance of narratives in contemporary media cultures , there is certainly every reason to share Fludernik 's " measured optimism " ( " Narratology " 757 ) about narratology 's continued survival . In an age like ours , in which the time-span between the invention of new theoretical approaches and their expiration dates has become shorter and shorter , it is impossible to predict whether or not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of their proponents currently hold for them , but the kind of cultural narratology outlined and applied above promises to be able to show what the point of narratology is , or what it could be . It seems wise , however , to leave the last word to John Bender , who strikes the right sort of balance between , on the one hand , acknowledging the undoubted usefulness of the narratological toolbox and , on the other hand , emphasizing both the need to move beyond a merely descriptive poetics of narrative and the benefits of understanding that the crossing of disciplinary boundaries affords : <p> If the opening of literary studies to cultural history is to continue . , we must value the finely crafted tools but leave the boundaries behind . A world made perfectly safe for narratology may offer the delights of Candide 's garden to the wise . But their contentment should not be bought at the cost of denying others the risks of intellectual travel . ( " Making " 33 ) <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
