Chapter One Mystrygrl : Seeks Man for Mystery . . . Lucy Rothschild pulled her BMW into the parking slot closest to the Starbucks entrance and shoved the vehicle into park . Rain pounded the hood of her car and bounced off the asphalt as she turned off the Beemer . Her gaze slid to the front of the strip mall and sought the green-and-white Starbucks sign next to the golden glare of Blockbuster Video . Light from within the coffee shop poured out onto the wet sidewalk , while the raindrops slipping down Lucy 's window smeared vivid color and inky shadows like an abstract painting . Next thing you know , some guy is wearing your head for a hat . Lucy turned off the car and shoved her keys in the pocket of her navy blue Ralph Lauren blazer . She hated when Maddie said things like that . When she made everyone else as paranoid and freaky as she was . Maddie interviewed psychopaths for a living , but that did n't mean all men were child molesters , rapists , or serial killers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction and was able to separate what she wrote from real life . Maddie seemed to have trouble with that . Lucy grabbed her umbrella from the passenger seat and opened her car door . It was n't as if she was going to set up a second meeting with hardluvnman or was even going to leave Starbucks with him . It was n't even as if she was taking this coffee date any more seriously than she 'd taken the others she 'd had during the past few months . She hit the button on her umbrella with her thumb , and the red canopy opened as she stepped from the car . Like the other " dates , " tonight was about work . She had her small notepad and pen in her pocket , right next to her little can of mace . She 'd brought the pen and paper in case she needed to write down interesting tidbits about hardluvnman after he left . She 'd brought the mace in case he wanted to wear her head for a hat . Damn that Maddie . Lucy paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the parking lot , dodging puddles on her way . Unless hardluvnman was different , she would n't even use the pen and paper . Unless he was different from the others , while they waited in line for coffee he 'd give her the slow up and down , as if she were an Airedale at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show . If she passed inspection , he 'd pay for her triple grande skinny latte ( hold the whip , please ) , ask her what she did for a living ( although she 'd clearly lied on her bio , stating she was a nurse ) , then proceed to talk about himself ( what a great guy he was ) and his former wife/girlfriend ( and what a dumb bee-yatch she was ) . If Lucy did n't pass the slow up and down , she 'd pay for her own coffee . Which had only happened to her once . Bigdaddy182 had been a real cheap bastard with a silver tooth and a neck-hair ponytail . He 'd taken one look at her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been a bigger abomination than his beer belly . She 'd bought her own coffee , then proceeded to listen to him talk about himself for the next hour . While he 'd rambled on about his run to Sturgis and his bitch of an ex-wife , Lucy had thought about different ways to kill him off . Bad , heinous ways . In the end , she 'd known she 'd have to stick to her female serial killer 's MO , but erotic asphyxiation had seemed too good a way for him to die . Two steps from the sidewalk , Lucy planted her foot in a puddle . She 'd almost made it . Cold water rushed over the toe of her black ankle boot and splashed the bottom of her black jeans . " Crap-ola ! " she said and stepped up on the curb . She opened the door to Starbucks and moved inside . The smell of rich , dark coffee filled her head , and the low steady hum of voices coalesced with the sound of the coffee grinder and espresso machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starbucks always looked and smelled the same . Kind of like Barnes and Noble or Border 's . There was some comfort in that . Lucy closed her umbrella , and her gaze took in the gold walls and the patrons sitting at brown tables and hard wooden chairs . No man in a red baseball hat . Hardluvnman was late . Lucy shoved her umbrella in the stand by the door and moved to the counter . When he 'd e-mailed her and asked her to meet him , he 'd written that his real name was Quinn . Lucy preferred to think of him as hardluvnman . She did n't want to think of him or any of these dates as real people . It was easier to kill them off that way . She ordered her latte , sans whip , then took a seat at a small round table in the corner . She unbuttoned her blazer and smoothed the collar of her navy blue turtleneck . She supposed it was a sad commentary on her love life that the only dates she 'd had lately had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason she was subjecting herself to men like bigdaddy182 was that she needed research for her new mystery novel , dead.com . Lucy raised the latte to her lips and took a cautious sip . She only needed one last victim for her book . Even if hardluvnman turned out to be a decent guy who did n't need to die , Lucy was done with Internet coffee dates . She 'd had enough of men who acted like it was her job to pursue them . Like she had to convince them to ask her out again . If this last date did n't prove fortuitous , she 'd figure something else out . Like taking all the lying , cheating , needy characteristics of all her former boyfriends and roll them into one . But she 'd done that before , and . . . Continues ...
