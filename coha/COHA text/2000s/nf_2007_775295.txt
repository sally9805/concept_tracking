Introduction : // Invitation to the Dance // When Europeans undertook their campaigns of conquest and exploration in what seemed to them " new " worlds , they found the natives engaged in many strange and lurid activities . Cannibalism was reported , though seldom convincingly documented , along with human sacrifice , bodily mutilation , body and face painting , and flagrantly open sexual practices . Equally jarring to European sensibilities was the almost ubiquitous practice of ecstatic ritual , in which the natives would gather to dance , sing , or chant to a state of exhaustion and , beyond that , sometimes trance . Everywhere they went  --  among the hunter-gatherers of Australia , the horticulturists of Polynesia , the village peoples of India  --  white men and occasionally women witnessed these electrifying rites so frequently that there seemed to them to be , among " the present societies of savage men . . . an extraordinary uniformity , in spite of much local variation , in ritual and mythology . " 1 The European idea of the " savage " came to focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dancing with wild abandon by the light of a fire . // What did they actually see ? A single ritual could look very different to different observers . When he arrived in Tahiti in the late 1700s , Captain Cook watched groups of girls performing " a very indecent dance which they call Timorodee , singing the most indecent songs and using most indecent actions . . . In doing this they keep time to a great nicety . " 2 About sixty years later , Herman Melville found the same ritual , by then called " Lory-Lory " and perhaps modified in other ways , full of sensual charm . // Presently , raising a strange chant , they softly sway themselves , gradually quickening the movement , until at length , for a few passionate moments with throbbing bosoms , and glowing cheeks , they abandon themselves to all the spirit of the dance , apparently lost to everything around . But soon subsiding again into the same languid measure as before , the eyes swimming in their heads , join in one wild chorus , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cook , Charles Darwin was repelled by the corroborree rite of western Australians , reporting that // the dancing consisted in their running either sideways or in Indian file into an open space , and stamping the ground with great force as they marched together . Their heavy footsteps were accompanied with a kind of grunt , by beating their clubs and spears together , and by various other gesticulations , such as extending their arms and wriggling their bodies . It was a most rude , barbarous scene , and , to our ideas , without any sort of meaning.4 // But to the anthropologists Baldwin Spencer and Frank Gillen , a similar Aboriginal rite was far more compelling , perhaps even enticing : " The smoke , the blazing torches , the showers of sparks falling in all directions and the masses of dancing , yelling men formed a genuinely wild and savage scene of which it is impossible to convey any adequate idea in words . " 5 It was this description that fed into the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim ? s notion of collective effervescence : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , he proposed , forms the ultimate basis of religion . // Through the institution of slavery , European Americans had the opportunity to observe their own captive " natives " at close range , and they too reported varying and contradictory responses to the ecstatic rituals of the transplanted Africans . Many whites of the slave-owning class saw such practices as " noisy , crude , impious , and , simply , dissolute , " 6 and took strong measures to suppress them . The nineteenth-century absentee owner of a Jamaican plantation found his slaves doing a myal dance , probably derived from an initiation rite of the Azande people of Africa , and described them as engaged in " a great variety of grotesque actions , and chanting all the while something between a song and a howl. " 7 Similarly , an English visitor to Trinidad in 1845 reported disgustedly that // on Christmas Eve , it seemed as if , under the guise of religion , all Pandemonium had been let loose . . . Drunkenness bursting forth in yells and bacchanalian orgies , was universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question , in the midst of such a disgusting and fiendish saturnalia . . . The musicians were attended by a multitude of drunken people of both sexes , the women being of the lowest class ; and all dancing , screaming and clapping their hands , like so many demons . All this was the effect of the " midnight mass , " ending , as all such masses do , in every species of depravity.8 // Other white observers , though , were sometimes surprised to find themselves drawn in by the peculiar power of such African-derived rituals and festivities . Traveling in the mid-nineteenth century , Frederick Law Olmsted observed a black Christian service in New Orleans and was swept up by the " shouts , and groans , terrific shrieks , and indescribable expressions of ecstasy  --  of pleasure or agony , " to the point where he found his own face " glowing " and feet stamping , as if he had been " infected unconsciously . " 9 Clinton Furness , a traveler to South Carolina in the 1920s , reported a similar experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religious worship . // Several men moved their feet alternately , in strange syncopation . A rhythm was born , almost without reference to the words of the preacher . It seemed to take place almost visibly , and grow . I was gripped with the feeling of a mass-intelligence , a self-conscious entity , gradually informing the crowd and taking possession of every mind there , including my own . . . I felt as if some conscious plan or purpose were carrying us along , call it mob-mind , communal composition , or what you will.10 // On the whole , though , white observers regarded the ecstatic rituals of darker-skinned peoples with horror and revulsion . Grotesque is one word that appears again and again in European accounts of such events ; hideous is another . Henri Junod , a nineteenth-century Swiss missionary among the Ba-Ronga people of southern Mozambique , complained of the drums ? " frightful din " and " infernal racket. " 11 Other Catholic missionaries , upon hearing the African drumbeat announcing a ritual event , felt it was their duty to disrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth century , the sound of drumming was enough to spook the white traveler , suggestive as it was of a world beyond human ken . " I have never heard an eerier sound , " a young English visitor to South Africa reports in the 1910 novel Prester John . " Neither human nor animal it seemed , but the voice of that world between which is hid from man ? s sight and hearing . " 13 In the introduction to his 1926 book on tribal dancing , the writer W. D. Hambly pleaded with his readers for a little " sympathy " for his subject . // The student of primitive music and dancing will have to cultivate a habit of broad-minded consideration for the actions of backward races . . . Music and dancing performed wildly by firelight in a tropical forest have not seldom provoked the censure and disgust of European visitors , who have seen only what is grotesque or sensual.14 // Or , in many cases , may have elected not to see at all : When the intrepid entomologist Evelyn Cheeseman tramped through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 1930s , she showed not the slightest curiosity about the many native " dancing grounds " she passed through . At one village she and her bearers were asked to leave because there was to be a feast and dance that evening , which were tambu , or forbidden , for outsiders to witness . Cheeseman was miffed by this glitch in her plans but comforted herself with the thought that " it is of course well known that it is not particularly desirable to stop in a strange village when the natives are being worked up to their usual frenzy of devil worship . " 15 // Particularly disturbing to white observers was the occasional climax of ecstatic ritual , in which some or all of the participants would , after prolonged dancing and singing or chanting , enter what we might now call an " altered state of consciousness , " or trance . People caught up in trance might speak in a strange voice or language , display a marked indifference to pain , contort their bodies in ways seemingly impossible in normal life , foam at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed by a spirit or deity , and ultimately collapse. * // A missionary among the Fiji Islanders described such a trance state as " a horrible sight , " 16 but it was sight that was not always possible for the traveler to avoid . In her 1963 survey of the ethnographic literature , the anthropologist Erika Bourguignon found that 92 percent of small-scale societies surveyed encouraged some sort of religious trances , in most cases through ecstatic group ritual.17 In one of the many accounts of trance behavior among " primitive " peoples , the early-twentieth-century German scholar T. K. Oesterreich offers this , from a white visitor to Polynesia. // As soon as the god was supposed to have entered the priest , the latter became violently agitated , and worked himself up to the highest pitch of apparent frenzy , the muscles of the limbs seemed convulsed , the body swelled , the countenance became terrific , the features distorted , the eyes wild and strained . In this state he often rolled on the earth , foaming at the mouth.18 // Promiscuous sex was at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannibalism have echoes in Christian rite . But as the anthropologist Michael Taussig writes , " It ? s the ability to become possessed . . . that signifies to Europeans awesome Otherness if not downright savagery. " 19 Trance was what many of those wild rituals seemed to lead up to , and for Europeans , it represented the very heart of darkness  --  a place beyond the human self . // Or , what was worse  --  a place within the human self . In Heart of Darkness , Joseph Conrad ? s narrator observes an African ritual and reflects that // it was unearthly , and the men were  --  No , they were not inhuman . Well , you know , that was the worst of it  --  this suspicion of their not being inhuman . It would come slowly to one . They howled and leaped , and spun , and made horrid faces ; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity  --  like yours  --  the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar . Ugly . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise , a dim suspicion of their being a meaning in it which you  --  so remote from the night of first ages  --  could comprehend . And why not ? The mind of man is capable of anything.20 // To Europeans , there was an obvious explanation for the ecstatic practices of native peoples around the world . Since these strange behaviors could be found in " primitive " cultures almost everywhere , and since they were never indulged in by the " civilized , " it followed that they must result from some fundamental defect of the " savage mind . " It was less stable than the civilized mind , more childlike , " plastic , " and vulnerable to irrational influence or " autosuggestion. " 21 In some instances , the savage mind was described as " out of control " and lacking the discipline and restraint that Europeans of the seventeenth century and beyond came to see as their own defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much under control  --  of his or her " witch doctor , " that is  --  or as a victim of " mob psychology . " 22 The American political scientist Frederick Morgan Davenport even proposed an anatomical explanation for the bizarre behavior of primitives : They had only a " single spinal ganglion " to process incoming sensory signals and convert them into muscular responses , while the civilized mind had , of course , an entire brain with which to assess the incoming data and weigh the body ? s responses.23 Hence the susceptibility of the savage to the compelling music and visual imagery of his or her culture ? s religious rituals  --  which was regrettable , since " the last thing the superstitious and impulsive negro race needs is a stirring of the emotions . " 24 // But if they thought about it , many Europeans must have realized that the group ecstasy so common among " natives " had certain parallels within Europe itself . For example , Catholic missionaries setting out from France after the 1730s would have heard about the heretical Parisian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured scenes as wild as anything that could be found among the " savages . " // While the assembled company redoubled their prayers and collectively reached extreme heights of religious enthusiasm , at least one of their number would suddenly lapse into uncontrolled motor activity . . . They thrashed about on the floor in a state of frenzy , screaming , roaring , trembling , and twitching . . . The excitement and the disordered movements , which might last for several hours , usually proved highly contagious , with certain convulsionaries apparently serving as a catalyst for the onset of various bodily agitations in others.25 // Later catalogers of " primitive " ecstatic behavior , like T. K. Oesterreich , recognized a more mundane European analogue to the bewildering rites of " savages " in the familiar tradition of carnival , where otherwise sober people costumed themselves , drank to excess , danced through the night , and otherwise inverted the normal staid and Christian order . " It must . . . be admitted , " he wrote , " that civilized people show a high degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may quote the peculiar psychic intoxication to which in certain places ( e.g. , Munich and Cologne ) a large part of the population falls victim on a given day of the year ( Carnival ) . " 26 Critics of the traditional European festivities sometimes drove home their point by imagining the colonial encounter in reverse , with a " savage " registering shock at the behavior of European carnival-goers . In 1805 , for example , a founder of the Basle Bible Society published a brochure entitled Conversation of a Converted Hottentot with a European Christian During Carnival Time , in which the " Hottentot " concludes that Basle is partially inhabited by " barbarous non-converted heathens . " At the end of the nineteenth century , a similar pamphlet featured a visiting " converted Hindu , " who confides that the wild doings at Basle ? s Fastnacht festivities put him in mind of " the idolatrous feasts and dances of my fellow-countrymen who are still heathens . " 27 // It was among their social inferiors , however , that Europeans found a more immediate analogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , the anthropologist Ann Stoler writes , " strong parallels were made between the immoral lives of the British underclass , Irish peasants , and ? primitive ? Africans . " 28 The English saw parallels between their own lower classes and Native Americans : " Savage slaves be in great Britaine here , as any you can show me there . " 29 Similarly , a mid-nineteenth-century visitor to rural Burgundy , in France , offered the caustic observation that " you don ? t have to go to America to see savages . " 30 And who were those people whose revels disrupted whole cities during carnivals in Germany , France , England , and Spain ? By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , they were likely to be peasants and the urban poor , with respectable folk doing their best to stay indoors during these dangerously licentious times . // So when the phenomenon of collective ecstasy entered the colonialist European mind , it was stained with feelings of hostility , contempt , and fear . Group ecstasy was something " others " experienced  --  savages or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for self-loss in the rhythms and emotions of the group , was a defining feature of " savagery " or otherness generally , signaling some fatal weakness of mind . As horrified witnesses of ecstatic ritual , Europeans may have learned very little about the peoples they visited ( and often destroyed in the process )  --  their deities and traditions , their cultures and worldview . But they did learn , or imaginatively construct , something centrally important about themselves : that the essence of the Western mind , and particularly the Western male , upper-class mind , was its ability to resist the contagious rhythm of the drums , to wall itself up in a fortress of ego and rationality against the seductive wildness of the world . //
