Arrival , Langdon Island <p> Before Ruth died , before there was a fall or a push or a jump from the old bridge , she lived on Langdon Island and loved Hale Brock . Before she loved Hale , she lived in a large beach house with her two sisters , who were wicked like those sisters in fairy tales , and who mocked Ruth 's choice of wide-brimmed hats and dramatic long skirts . Ruth felt as if she had been born in the wrong century and , like a lot of people who believed that , she sighed and read old journals and talked about what life could or should have been if she had lived one hundred years ago . <p> Hale and Ruth were married and lived on Langdon , which is a sleepy South Carolina island near Charleston that was starting to attract developers who like to take sleepy islands and wake them up . I moved to Langdon when my sister moved there but was n't too keen on loving me anymore , and there was an accident and a lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared to tell . I tended to be a little closemouthed , a term that made me think of someone going around with their lips pursed and looking prunish and uncomfortable . I hoped I did n't look like that . If I was closemouthed , it was only because I liked to see what other people were going to say first . I wanted them to make the first move , to tip their hand a bit before I dove in with a thought or an idea . It 's who I was . <p> March , my little sister , on the other hand , was openmouthed , openhearted , and lived life pretty wide open . She was the best and the brightest , and you never forgot March . I thought of March sometimes as being the same age as me , like we were twins , because I ca n't remember life without her . Even though I was two years older and felt every bit the big sister , March seemed to be ageless or timeless . Or at least she did at one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was changing , changed , and different . He was grieving his wife , the lovely and talented Ruth . She was a costume designer for the theater , which meant she had fabulous clothes , daring dresses , and saucy hats . Around Hale 's neat beach bungalow he had placed framed black-and-white pictures of his lost wife . I saw Ruth dancing , I saw her laughing . I saw her tousle-headed in bed and I saw her dipping down to kiss Hale 's brow . She was a beautiful woman , with dark arched eyebrows and soft-looking lips . Her back was straight and she had long legs . Often , when I was over at Hale 's cooking up a pot of pasta or shucking summer corn , I got the feeling Ruth still visited the bungalow . It was n't a scary , ghostly feeling . It was more like a warm blanket . I asked Hale if he felt this . Mostly , I just tried to listen to him when he talked of her . <p> Hale knew all about me and March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth . But how much do you really know about someone who is gone ? I knew March and I knew Hale , but Ruth would always be a black-and-white photograph . Someone else 's memory . I could feel as if I knew her and her penchant for coconut-flavored lip gloss or her love of ice-cold watermelon plucked from the cooler at the Shop All , but these were memories told to me . Often , in those first few weeks of getting to know Hale , I thought I glimpsed his wife in the run-down corner grocery store up on our end of the island . There , there she was , her dark hair smoothed back in a turquoise silk scarf . There , there she was dipping her hands into the piles of apples and oranges . I would stop and stare at the women I thought were Ruth . I would take a step toward them , my heart pounding . If I found her , maybe she was never lost and I could return her to Hale . But then the woman with the scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I knew that it was not her . It was not the woman I thought I knew in the photographs . <p> I liked walking on the beach at sunset . I 'm not a morning person , and for me , sunrise beach walks were few and far between . So , between the time the sun headed for the warm Atlantic and the last moments it dipped beneath the shelf of day and night , I would stroll along the beach . We lived at the east end of the island in a neighborhood that was shabby and perfectly isolated . As I trod over wet sand and spy fiddler crabs darting to and fro , I could see the tall condos farther down the beach . The crowds were bigger : there were more beach umbrellas closing up for the day , more people streaming out of the condo developments to observe the purple-pink sunset . Up where I was , I could catch the eye of maybe two , three people . Some of them are neighbors . They have taken to me , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried not to look at while I walked was the old bridge , now coming down in sections where the highway department was dismantling it in what had to be the slowest road project in history . The old concrete bridge , like its newer , flashier replacement , spanned the bay between Langdon Island and the mainland . It was grayed and stained , a testament to another era when cars came over to the island one lane at a time . Back when the old bridge was built , the cars were slower , and who really needed to go to Langdon anyway ? It was the place of some poor people , a few waterfront communities of ramshackle beach houses on stilts , and a tiny strip of commercial interests . A bait shop . An unused outpost for the county sheriff who was rumored to have never stepped foot on the island at all . Nope , Langdon was no one 's idea of a beach paradise and the bridge was an old-fashioned concrete welcome mat , not seen until a person really needed to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the one that replaced it , one day , the day I first came to Langdon to see my sister March . <p> My dented sedan cheerfully pulled along a small , rented trailer full of clothes , a futon , and books , while I piloted down Highway 9 . Langdon Island was a new home for March and me , and I wondered what the streets would look like , how the sand might sweep over the sidewalks , what we would find there . <p> I had left Atlanta and its tangle of interstates and commuters six hours ago . If I closed my eyes briefly , I could still feel the heat of the city and the thumping traffic , pressing against my head . I saw , and almost felt , the office I left in the glass building downtown . The air in my office was always too cool . I pictured my empty apartment . Within days , a new tenant would fill it up with her things . My brightly colored rugs and framed posters were in the trailer behind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of Langdon , I glanced at the map . The highway ran alongside the bay , eventually crossing the water and running straight into town on the island . The highway then terminated after faithfully carrying cars for hundreds of miles . On my map , the words " Road Construction " were stamped over the highway . I wondered if we would be delayed . But then I reminded myself I had no one waiting for me in Langdon . No one , unless you counted my sister . And it would be wrong to do that , because she was n't waiting for me . <p> I ran my mind over our friendship , our sisterhood . Was there a way to go back ? Maybe if I started at the beginning . Maybe if I stepped back to when we were young and life was more of a lark , at least for March . She always knew how to get a rise out of me and Mom and Dad . But for all of her missteps and passion , I knew of her sweet and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . When did it slip away and become something I did not recognize ? My heart beat a little faster thinking of my sister on the island ahead . Once , she ran to me to solve her problems . I could not fix her life now . I could not make her whole again . <p> Orange signs , barrels , and cones let me know that the road construction lay ahead . The bay appeared  --  beautiful , gray , and ringed with tan grasses and sticky mudflats . A few miles away , the town on the island waited . I slowed to the construction zone speed postings . Other cars and trucks slowed , too , as I made my way onto the slick , gray concrete bridge spanning the bay . <p> I am not a fan of crossing over water in a vehicle . I always think that some idiot is going to tap my car from behind causing me to careen over the side and die a watery death . How will I get out ? I anxiously started across the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious , even to a casual observer like me . I was riding on the new , wide bridge . An old , brownish concrete bridge sat off to my right , lower and swarthier than the current bridge just crossed . Its buckled concrete spans had weeds growing up through cracks . The highway powers were clearly dismantling this old bridge ; every quarter of a mile or so , there were huge gaps that had been removed from the highway , revealing churning bay waters below . It was both scary and interesting at the same time . The highway was useless , I thought . Then I reconsidered because I saw the signs for the first time . <p> Someone had opted to use the old bridge as an art gallery . Or as a signpost to despair , to love . I sigh when I remember what I thought of the signs . I figured they were the work of a desperate , pimpled high schooler . Maybe a tech school dropout who lost his first love . Or a young husband longing for his wayward wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Hale 's signs , but really I should have cried . Because when I saw the signs , carefully bolted to the side of each decaying section of decaying bridge , I was watching a man become unraveled , tube by tube of paint . Piece by piece of plywood . And when the bridge was through , when the old bridge petered out at the foamy shores of the island , that man would have told us all he knew . <p> Each sign , painted purple , painted red . <p> Miss Your Lips Ruth . <p> Excerpted from THE WIDE SMILES of GIRLS by Jennifer Manske Fenske Copyright 2009 by Jennifer Manske Fenske Published in June 2009 by St. Martin
