" The Island " <p> by <p> Caspian Tredwell-Owen <p> 1/13/04 Caspian Tredwell-Owen <p> Copyright 2004 <p> We PULL BACK , in marked steps , to include neighboring apartments with identical frosted facades . Then more apartments , above and below , the tiers linked by ramps and crosswalks . It might be a prison cellblock but there are no guards apparent . Indeed , the residents move freely , all notably male , all clad in shearlings , polo shirts and slacks . It is just another day in Sector Four . <p> 3 INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY <p> Satie 's Gymnopedie plays from overhead speakers . A glass wall looks out across a green mountain valley . The plaza , formed in curves of creamy ceramic tile , is divided into two service areas . Male residents in line on one side , females on the other . Both genders combine in the seating area . Lincoln reaches the head of the line . He swipes his ethercuff over a scanner . A NUTRITION CLERK , a surly woman in uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLERK # Lincoln Six-Echo ... Options are dried fruit , oatmeal or anything in bran . <p> # LINCOLN # What ? No bacon ? <p> # NUTRITION CLERK # You got a sodium flag , pal - now what 's it going to be ? <p> # LINCOLN # Whatever . <p> He shrugs , disgruntled . The clerk taps her screen . Turning to a row of chutes behind her , she collects a foil covered bowl and a drink can . Lincoln , less than appetized , loads his tray with the oatmeal and juice breakfast . Then he heads into the seating area . <p> In the seating area , male and female residents sit eating and chatting happily . Uniformed busboys intermix , clearing and wiping tables . A divide in this community now starts to become clear ... <p> The busboys , like the nutrition clerk , like all the service , maintenance , and administrative staff we 'll see , have distinct uniforms but no facial marking . They are known as " outsiders " . The " residents " , like Lincoln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their wrists . Mostly Caucasian , from mid-twenties to mid-sixties . There are no children here . <p> We isolate a blonde - mid-20 's , fresh , bright eyes , a fragile beauty , a crosshatch of two verticals and one horizontal . Her name is ESTER TWO-ALPHA . Seeing Lincoln , she smiles and waves- <p> # ESTER # Lincoln ! Over here ! <p> Lincoln crosses , a little surprised to see her . Pleasantly so . <p> # LINCOLN # Hello , stranger . <p> # ESTER # What ? You do n't recognize me ? <p> # LINCOLN # It 's just an expression , that 's all . <p> # ESTER # You and your expressions , Lincoln . Now sit down and ask me where I 've been . <p> # LINCOLN # ( sits , a spreading smile ) Okay , Ester . Where have you been ? <p> # ESTER # At the medical center . Just for tests but they had me on liquid nutrition . ( forks a mouthful of eggs ) Mmmmm . This is the first solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LINCOLN # Exciting . <p> # ESTER # That 's not the exciting part . I got my first trimester report : happy , healthy and contaminant-free ... Both of us . <p> # LINCOLN # Us ? <p> # ESTER # My baby ... It 's in perfect condition . I just hope I can keep it that way . I still have six months to delivery . <p> # LINCOLN # Then you leave all this behind , huh ? <p> # ESTER # Why ? Will you miss me ? <p> Her eyes betray a flicker of something . It unsettles Lincoln . <p> # LINCOLN # I 'll miss your coffee . C'm on , I already burned up my quota . <p> # ESTER # Okay . But this is the last time . <p> In a deliberate move , she drops her napkin on the floor . As she ducks down to retrieve it , Lincoln steals a gulp of her coffee . Rising again , Ester registers his souring look . <p> # ESTER # What is it ? <p> Lincoln just nods across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival . An outsider in a grey , vaguely clerical uniform - sanguine , settled , precise eyes . He might be a prison warden but for the generally warm reception . He is known as The Community Director . His name is MERRICK . <p> He crosses to a lectern , unlooping a chain from his neck with a three-forked pendant known as a " tri-key " . He slots the tri-key into the lectern . The glass wall frosts over and pixellates into a live feed of himself . Now amplified by the plaza speakers , Merrick begins his address- <p> # MERRICK # Good morning . To everyone here and everyone watching on etherscreen , welcome to the community address . Today I 'm coming to you from Sector Four . For those of you here with sugar quotas , let me recommend the french toast . I just tried some and it 's excellent , really . But I know what everyone 's hungry for so let 's move on to the lottery . As always the draw will be made from our host sector . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Daily Spin ? <p> Applause and whistles erupt , mostly from the younger residents , who take on the zeal of a game show audience . The older ones - including Lincoln - greet the prospect with labored tolerance . Merrick turns the tri-key in the lectern . The glass wall switches from the live feed to a jumbotron of flashing text ; <p>  --  DAILY SPIN ! ... GET READY TO WIN ! ... DAILY SPIN !  --  <p> # MERRICK # Let The Spin begin . <p> To a burst of cheers , he turns the tri-key another notch . The glass wall becomes a spinning blur , like a tumbler on a slot machine . But instead of icons , it clicks through names , each separated by a blank line - from " Adams One-Alpha " to " Zucker Three-Charlie " - scrolling the entire population of Sector Four . <p> As the spin slows , a pent silence falls . Expectant eyes watch the names click through the P 's , the Q 's , the R 's , the S 's and ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  <p> # MERRICK # Starkweather Two-Delta ! Step up ! <p> Cheers and applause as everyone looks for the lucky recipient . The excitement abates as it becomes clear he 's not among them . <p> # MERRICK # Well , Starkweather , if you 're watching on etherscreen - your time has come , my friend ! You 're moving out to The Island ! ( another burst of cheers ) And the rest of you , never lose hope ; what do we know about The Daily Spin ? <p> THE YOUNGER RESIDENTS Everyone gets to win ! <p> # MERRICK # And tomorrow it could be you ... <p> Merrick steps down and departs . The plaza reverts to its former mood , dotted with murmurs of disappointment . Lincoln scowls . <p> # ESTER # Do n't worry . Your time will come . <p> # LINCOLN # That 's easy for you to say . Your time 's guaranteed . All you have is six months . <p> # ESTER # Six months of mood swings , sore back and swollen feet . Want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Give me some more of your coffee . <p> 4 INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR - DAY <p> The portal is spanned by a rank of latticed metal gates , known as an " ethergate . " Residents swipe their ethercuffs over scanners , the gates hiss open and they step through in systematic order . <p> 5 INT . SUBWAY PLATFORM - SECTOR FOUR - DAY <p> The subway , formed in arches of creamy ceramic tile , is not unlike our own . In place of escalators , moving walkways deliver the residents onto the platform . Along the platform wall runs a strip of mirrored panels , etherscreen reporting in banner crawl : <p>  --  NEXT STOP ... SECTOR 5 - SECTOR 6 - CENTERVILLE ... <p> At the tunnel edge of the platform is a safety fence , where the residents wait in a patient line , Lincoln among them . His focus is drawn to two younger residents whispering furtively nearby . <p> RESIDENT #1 A stim unit says it hits the wall . <p> RESIDENT #2 Okay . But I get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a drink can . Resident #2 ducks under the fence , reaching the can down to the track . Or what looks like a track . The struts lining the bed are not sleepers but buffers of galvanized rubber . Nor are there any rails . The relay system is provided by a series of metal posts , flanking the buffers to run in twin parallel . Known as " lode-poles , " they now start thrumming and pulsing with red light , like runway beacons . <p> RESIDENT #1 Hurry it up . The shuttle 's coming . <p> Resident #2 regains the platform . We PUSH IN on the drink can , balanced on a buffer . It starts rattling . Then suddenly shoots upward into the air , arcing and bouncing off the tunnel wall , clattering into obscurity . Resident #1 whoops in victory . <p> A rush of air heralds the shuttle . It sails out of the tunnel , floating three feet above the track . A hybrid of subway car and nautical craft , it has runners in place of wheels , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetic flow emanating from the lode-poles , an invisible river known as a " lode-stream " . The shuttle drifts to a gentle halt , hovering , rocking a little . Its gangplanks fold out toward the platform and the safety fence lowers . Lincoln and the other commuters file routinely aboard . <p> 6 INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY <p> An avenue of cream colored buildings . Uniform in architecture , rising five stories to meet a mirrored roof . Despite lighting arrays , the absence of sky lends a chasmic quality . Lincoln follows the flow of residents up the avenue . Building signs read : " Dept . Of Labor " , " Dept . Of Health " , " Dept . Of Sanitation " . He splits off , turning into a building marked " Dept . Of Population . " <p> 7 INT . OFFICES - DEPARTMENT OF POPULATION - DAY <p> Frosted glass workstations , notably circular rather than square . Lincoln sits at his desk in front of a wraparound etherscreen , divided into three sections , a formation known as a " visor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a permanent screen saver . Mid-visor shows a tomograph of a residential block ; tiers of apartments shown as boxes , most in solid white , a few blink red with the text label " Vacancy " . Left-visor shows a list of names and sociographic gradings headed " Residents Pending " . <p> LINCOLN ( TO VISOR ) Hudson Four-Alpha ; profile reviewed . Match to vacancy ; 171 , Sector 5 . Request clearance to populate . <p>  --  PROCESSING ... FOUR-ALPHA , HUDSON ; POPULATION APPROVED <p> Left-visor , the name highlights then blinks out . Mid-visor , a box labelled " Vacancy " turns from blinking red to solid white . <p> A VOICE ( O.S. ) Hey , you want to know something ? <p> Lincoln looks up at a face grinning over the partition - mid 30 's , jovial , tall and burly . His name is JONES THREE-BRAVO . <p> # JONES # You know that guy who won the Spin in your sector ? Starkweather ? <p> # LINCOLN # No . <p> # JONES # I had a bout with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? Six months . <p> # LINCOLN # Six months ? <p> # JONES # You do n't believe me - look it up . <p> LINCOLN ( TO VISOR ) Census File : Two-Delta , Starkweather . <p>  --  TWO-DELTA , STARKWEATHER : 102 , SECTOR 4  --  DAY : 186 / HR : 09:31 <p> # JONES # What do you say now ? Still think The Spin 's rigged for the long haulers ? <p> # LINCOLN # He got lucky , that 's all . <p> # JONES # And do n't you wish it was you ... out there on The Island ... nature 's own clean air zone ... no screening , no quotas ... unlimited pleasure ... <p> # LINCOLN # Shut up , Jonesy . <p> # JONES # Why do n't you make me ? In the ring . <p> # LINCOLN # You 're out of my weight-class . <p> # JONES # Not anymore . They just got the new program in - multi-weight balancing . <p> # LINCOLN # I 'll think about it . <p> # JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't last three rounds . <p> 8 INT . BOXING RING - CENTERVILLE - EARLY EVENING <p> - CRACK-  The same face recoils from a punch . Jones shakes it off , retreating , recovering . He resets his guard as Lincoln moves in . Lincoln jabs at Jones ' defenses , his blowing hitting harder than we 'd expect from his stature . Suddenly he breaks through with a left hook . Jones staggers back . A strange ripple distorts his face . Stranger still , his skin tone takes on a grainy pallor . <p> As the bout continues , we widen to see the boxing ring is indeed a ring rather than a square and beyond the ropes is an outer ring . With Lincoln in FG , we now see another figure in the outer ring , mirroring his moves , dressed identically but for the gloves which are like gauntlets . The gauntlets are rigged to two armatures which are , in turn , rigged to a gantry-like mechanism . It glides noiselessly to and fro , shadowing the figure round the outer ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The real Lincoln , in fact . The one in FG is a derivative hologram known as a " proxy " . As Lincoln fakes and jabs , the counter-weighted armatures drag and recoil , duplicating the exertions of his proxy . Jones moves more sluggishly , his proxy now ghostly , transparent . Now being sent on a last offensive only to be roundhoused by another left hook . Jones ' proxy topples and explodes into a pixellated mist . <p> # LINCOLN # Whoooooo ! <p> Lincoln proxy - and Lincoln - punch the air in victory . Jones unlatches his gauntlets , sweating , galled by the defeat- <p> # JONES # Sure you input the right weight class ? <p> # LINCOLN # You 're just too slow , Jonesy . <p> # JONES # You 're faster cause you 're lighter . Programmers ... they always miss something . <p> # LINCOLN # Hey , you put up , now pay up . <p> 9 INT . STIM BAR - CENTERVILLE - EVENING <p> Rainbow light and swirling electronic music . The clientele are all male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing women , beckoning , text supers flashing : <p>  --  NEW AT THE PLEASURE CENTER ! ... OR TRY A MYSTERY DATE ! ... <p> At the bar , Lincoln and Jones , freshly showered , each swipe their ethercuffs over a scanner . A uniformed BARTENDER notes the readout- <p> # BARTENDER # Jones Three-Bravo ; you got five units . Your friend , he 's got an alcohol flag . <p> # JONES # So make it a beer and a Vita Cola . <p> The bartender serves the drinks and they settle at the end of the bar . Scoping for onlookers , Lincoln steals a gulp of Jones ' beer . <p> # JONES # You know , you 're going to get yourself contaminated one of these days . <p> # LINCOLN # Shut up , Jonesy . <p> # JONES # So , you up for a rematch tomorrow ? <p> # LINCOLN # I ca n't . I got an interact . <p> # JONES # With who ? That blonde again ? <p> # LINCOLN # Hey , it 's an authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # JONES # You want to get flagged for proximity ? <p> # LINCOLN # No law against friendship , Jonesy . <p> # JONES # Quick ... Give me that beer back . <p> TWO CENSUS OFFICERS ( " CENSORS " ) enter the bar ; in wireless head-sets and white uniforms , they seem at once clinical and military . CENSOR 1 carries a tablet known as an " etherboard " . CENSOR 2 , more imposing , carries a wide-muzzle rifle known as a " stopgun " . <p> Their foreboding appearance is greeted without alarm . As they move up the bar , the customers dutifully swipe their ethercuffs over the etherboard . Now reaching Jones , who swipes accordingly- <p> # JONES # What 's going on , officer ? <p> CENSOR 1 Census check . <p> Censor 1 checks the etherboard ; a headshot of Jones spins in 3-D . He offers it to Lincoln who swipes his ethercuff emphatically- <p> # LINCOLN # What happened ? You lost count ? <p> CENSOR 1 I hope nobody 's drinking off-quota . <p> # LINCOLN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln sips his cola . As they move on , he grimaces at the taste . <p> 10 INT . SHUTTLE - IN TRANSIT - LATER <p> Lincoln stares out of the window . The red pulse of the lode poles catches a glazed look in his eyes . His pupils , a little dilated . His focus returns to the interior and an etherscreen banner : <p>  --  GET READY FOR THE DAILY SPIN ! ... TOMORROW IT COULD BE YOU ... <p> 11 INT . BEDROOM - LINCOLN 'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT DAY <p> The horizon . The morning sun streams over the green mountains . Lincoln lies sleeping , his head buried under the pillow . Off a beeping sound , he stirs and squints up at the mirrored ceiling : <p>  --  ETHERCALL PENDING ; ACCEPT OR SEND TO MESSAGE BANK ? <p> # LINCOLN # Accept . <p> The etherscreen resolves Ester 's face , fresh and bright . <p> ESTER ( ON ETHERSCREEN ) Lincoln ? I missed you at breakfast . <p> # LINCOLN # I guess I overslept . <p> ESTER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on for tonight . The interact . <p> # LINCOLN # Right . I 'll be there . <p> ESTER ( ON ETHERSCREEN ) I 'll see you then . Enjoy your day ! <p> Her face blinks out . Lincoln gets out of bed with a smile . <p> 12 INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR - DAY <p> Lincoln exits his apartment and heads up the walkway . We reveal the walkway ends at another ethergate , governing residential access . Lincoln swipes his ethercuff over a scanner and a gate swings open . He heads on , the gate hissing closed behind him . <p> 13 INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY <p> Ravel 's Pavane plays overhead . The plaza is emptying as residents leave for work . Lincoln arrives at the service counter . He swipes his ethercuff and greets the clerk with an amiable grin . <p> # LINCOLN # Just juice today . I 'm late for work . <p> # NUTRITION CLERK # Too bad . I got ta serve the full meal . <p> Lincoln shrugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin fades as he spots TWO CENSORS talking to a busboy . Then the view is lost as he 's served an oatmeal and juice breakfast . <p> 14 INT . SUBWAY PLATFORM - SECTOR FOUR - DAY <p> Not so crowded at this hour . Halfway down the platform we see a vending machine with confections in nameless silver wrappers . A mouse-ish resident collects a bar from the trough . His name is KLEINWORT NINE-ALPHA . Seeing Lincoln approach , he preempts- <p> # KLEINWORT # No , no , no . Use your own sugar quota . <p> # LINCOLN # C'm on , Kleinwort ... <p> He says this amicably enough but he 's using his imposing presence on the smaller man . Kleinwort sighs and breaks off a chunk . <p> # LINCOLN # So what 's up with the Censors , huh ? <p> # KLEINWORT # They 're conducting a census check . Or do n't you watch the bulletins ? <p> # LINCOLN # I know what it is . I 've just never seen them out in this sector before . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad scanner or maybe an userware defect . ( off Lincoln 's puzzled look ) Ethercuffs . They get damaged , you get a false read . Sometimes even a dropout . <p> # LINCOLN # What are you saying ? They lost someone ? <p> # KLEINWORT # Someone just is n't showing up where they should be . What do you care ? <p> A rush of air heralds the shuttle , curtailing the conversation . Beneath his tousling hair , a frown plays on Lincoln 's brow . <p> 15 INT . LINCOLN 'S WORKSTATION - DEPT . OF POPULATION - DAY <p> Lincoln stares at the fractal on right-visor , at the intricate paths of dysplasia . The glazed look has returned to his eyes , his pupils , a little dilated . His stare narrows at an errant thought . He shrugs it off . But the thought returns , persistent . More to dispel than indulge it , Lincoln turns to mid-visor- <p> LINCOLN ( TO VISOR ) Census File : Two-Delta , Starkweather . <p>  --  TWO-DELTA , STARKWEATHER : 102 , SECTOR 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( TO VISOR ) Accomodation Status : 102 , Sector 4 . <p> The tiered boxes resolve , zooming in to isolate Apartment 102 . The box shows solid white . Lincoln frowns , assimilating this . <p> # LINCOLN # Hey , Jonesy . Remember the guy who won The Spin yesterday ? His apartment 's still showing as occupied . <p> JONES ( O.S. ) So ? <p> # LINCOLN # So you get 24 hours to move out . <p> JONES ( O.S. ) Maybe the system did n't update yet . <p> # LINCOLN # No . It updates on the hour . If he 's gone it should be showing a vacancy . <p> # JONES # ( appearing over the partition ) What ? You think he 's still here ? The guy wins a place on The Island and you think he just decided not to go ? <p> # LINCOLN # I do n't know . He was n't there to step up . And now there 's a census check ... <p> # JONES # And now nothing . It 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> # JONES # A stim unit says I can prove it . Cross reference with sanitation . <p> LINCOLN ( TO VISOR ) Sanitation Status : 102 , Sector Four . <p>  --  PROCESSING ... APT. 102 ; CLOSED FOR CONTAINMENT CHECK  --  <p> # JONES # See ? Standard procedure . They got to sweep it for the next occupant . <p> Their supervisor interrupts them - an outsider , efficient-type- <p> # SUPERVISOR # If you gentlemen are n't busy ... Perhaps I could get an update on sector six ? <p> # LINCOLN # Still in the electrical phase , sir . <p> # SUPERVISOR # Well the guys upstairs are griping about the backlog . So go over there and light some fires , will you ? <p> # LINCOLN # ( pulls on his jacket to leave ) I 'll take care of it . <p> # SUPERVISOR # Are n't you forgetting something ? ( holds up A STEEL BRIEFCASE ) Or do you want to get contaminated ? <p> 16 INT . CONSTRUCTION ZONE - SECTOR SIX - DAY <p> An arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torch over a conduit . In the fog of smoke , we see wires being spliced , circuits , tested . Outsiders in hardhats , goggles and cup masks . Lincoln comes over the crosswalk , starkly contrasted in dacron coveralls and a hooded gasmask . THE CREW FOREMAN intercepts him - drawn , desiccated features , a husky drawl . His name is MCCORD- <p> # MCCORD # Sorry , chief . I ca n't let you get any closer . We got live wires over there . <p> Lincoln 's reply is muffled by the gasmask , lost in the noise . <p> # MCCORD # What 's that you said ? <p> Lincoln repeats to no avail . Frustrated , he peels off his gasmask- <p> # LINCOLN # I said I ca n't hear you . <p> McCord chuckles at the irony . <p> # MCCORD # Hey , you get yourself contaminated , do n't come pointing the finger at me . <p> # LINCOLN # How are you doing , Mac ? <p> # MCCORD # You know how it is . Gets to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # LINCOLN # Well the guys upstairs are griping about the backlog . They want to know when you 'll be ready for move in . <p> # MCCORD # I guess if we bust our backs , we could be out of here by the end of the week . <p> # LINCOLN # I 'll tell them two weeks . <p> # MCCORD # Thanks , chief . I appreciate that . <p> # LINCOLN # So ... got any stuff on you today ? <p> 17 INT . AIRLOCK - SECTOR SIX <p> A sign reads " Warning ! Contamination Risk ! " . Lincoln stands by as McCord unloops a neckchain with a single-forked pendant known as a " uni-key " . He slots it into the top of three keyholes . A light starts flashing and the airlock gives a heavily pressurized hiss . <p> 18 INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT <p> A deep steady thrum . Giant extractor fans churn above and below , both directions seemingly limitless . The bleak concrete shaft is streaked with soot , threaded by ladders and catwalks . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking cigarettes . <p> # LINCOLN # It 's too bad . <p> # MCCORD # What do you mean ? <p> # LINCOLN # That your shift 's almost over . <p> # MCCORD # You mean , these things ? Well , these things ai n't good for you anyways . <p> # LINCOLN # They taste good . <p> An exchanged smile . A pause as they enjoy the guilty pleasure . <p> # LINCOLN # I like coming here . Talking . Most outsiders do n't like to talk . <p> # MCCORD # That 's because we ai n't supposed to . They got rules about fraternization . <p> Lincoln nods . Another pause as they drag on their cigarettes . <p> # LINCOLN # What do you do when the shift 's over ? <p> # MCCORD # More of the same . They cycle us onto the disposal detail . Hump n dump crew . <p> # LINCOLN # Hump n dump crew ? <p> # MCCORD # Debris clearance . We hump the heavy stuff to a site on the outside . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there ? <p> McCord looks momentarily puzzled . Lincoln displays his gasmask . <p> # LINCOLN # The air ... the containments . <p> # MCCORD # Right . <p> # LINCOLN # But not everywhere . Not on The Island . <p> # MCCORD # ( beat , stubs his cigarette ) I do n't know too much about that . <p> Lincoln eyes him narrowly . McCord pauses , then tucks his lighter into the cigarette box and offers it with a palliative smile . <p> # MCCORD # Hey , take it from me , you got a sweet deal right here . So why worry , huh ? <p> Lincoln shrugs , accepting the gift with a slow exhale of smoke . We tilt up to follow the smoke plume , dissipating into the fans . <p> 19 EXT . THE WORLD OUTSIDE - DAY <p> Air blasts up from a giant tunnel . <p> Widening , we see it is one of a huge ring , planted in the dust , backdropped by mountainous red rocks . At the hub of the ring is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ducting plunge into its surround . These are the inlets for the processed air that feeds the underground ... <p> This is the landscape of the world outside and manifestly above . <p> From the processing plant , we pull back and up , raking over a large industrial complex . More cubic buildings , cream colored , windowless , like stacks of giant playing bricks . Now we see the front of the complex . The planate facade , faceless but for the entrance , cubed in polarized glass , like a dark cyclopean eye . <p> From the entrance , we follow a walkway out to a dock where the ground drops away into a broad concrete trench ; like the subway , lined with lode-poles and buffers , it is known as a " lodeway " . From the dock , we follow the lodeway out to a perimeter wall ; red rock slabs , twenty feet high , framing a giant gateway . The gates now glide open to disclose a view of the world outside the wall- <p> The shimmering bleached wilderness of The Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodeway tapers into the scrub , a vehicle emerges from the shimmer . A hybrid of bus and nautical craft , single hulled , known simply as a " liner " . Now as the liner becomes clearer , a decal on its prow is revealed - a crosshatch insignia over a blocky legend " The Sanger Institute " . <p> 20 INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY <p> The polarized glass shows the liner has docked and A TOUR GROUP is disembarking . The men are mostly over 40 , bloated by luxury . The women , mostly under 30 , wives and girlfriends , all jewels and haute couture . They filter into the entrance hall to be greeted by the courtesy staff . Pretty girls in short skirts and blazers with the crosshatch insignia , led by a pert redhead named LYDIA . <p> # LYDIA # Ladies and gentlemen , my name is Lydia and on behalf of our staff , I 'd like to welcome you to The Sanger Institute . <p> LYDIA ( cont 'd ) Before we start the tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circulating our standard discretion agreements . I should add that today you are all very lucky because our CEO and founder , Dr. Henry Sanger , is with us and will be leading the tour personally . <p> 21 INT . INNER FOYER - LATER <p> The crosshatch emblem spins on a wall-to-wall screen . Not a real screen but a projected flat known as a " holoframe " . Here , Lydia assembles the tour group , nursing wine glasses and canapes . The holoframe fades up a serene music track and a commercial begins : A series of vignettes ; an old man shuffling on a walking frame  - -  a middle-aged woman in a bathing suit , one breast flattened by a mastectomy  --  a young woman in labor , her face knotted in pain . The group watches with frowns and disapproving mumbles . Then- <p> VOICE ( O.S. ) It 's not a pretty sight , is it ? <p> Eyes turn to a figure behind them , dressed in a vestmental white labcoat - 70 's , tall , slightly hunched by senility , eyes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionary stooping to the role of a salesman . His name is DR . HENRY SANGER . <p> DR . SANGER ( cont 'd ) Mortality . We all know its face and yet we look away , do n't we ? We deny that our lives are ordained to suffering . That we are all , inalterably , going to die . <p> He pauses , fielding the various disconcerted looks . Then smiles . <p> DR . SANGER It takes courage to confront mortality , my friends . And I see it in each of you . My name is Dr. Henry Sanger and I 'm here to reward your courage . <p> Lydia applauds . The tour group dutifully follows suit . Sanger whispers a question in Lydia 's ear . She broadcasts her response- <p> # LYDIA # Today 's group is from New Gaza Health Care . They 're with the platinum plan . <p> DR . SANGER New Gaza . Yes , very good oncology unit . <p> Mulling this , he ambles through the holoframe which ripples at his passage . Rallied by Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SALES HALL - DAY <p> A hall of windows , each window framing a display case , each display case housing a different taxidermied animal . Not unlike a museum . On closer inspection , more like a chamber of horrors . In one window is a pig with a horribly distended abdomen . Another , magnified , shows a mouse with a human ear grown on its back . In another , a chimpanzee stares out at us with glaringly human eyes . <p> DR . SANGER It does n't get any prettier , does it ? But this is not a freakshow , my friends . This is a war museum . A history of our battles with mortality ... and defeats . Take the stem cell , for instance . A bid to cultivate human parts for transplant - in rodents , primates , barnyard animals . It 's enough to make your skin crawl . In some cases literally , giving rise to a new range of cross-species viruses . But that 's how we learn . From our mistakes . <p> They turn a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amber fluid that might be formaldehyde . Suspended within are embryos , fetuses and infants . All human . All grotesquely mutated . <p> DR . SANGER Case in point , the clone . Back in the beginning , the mapping of the human genome was declared a historic landmark-to break the curse of heredity , to correct congenital defect ... genetic engineering became the brave new world of medical science . A bright future that led to a dark age and much of the legislation we know today . But while the clone laws may have narrowed the field , science marches on . Only to hit the same wall over and over again - the enigma of growth , the alchemy that takes us from embryo to adult . A clone barely reaches infancy before its growth enzymes misfire , resulting in the kind of monstrosities - which are only effigies - you see here . <p> Some reassured sighs from the women . They turn another corner onto another hall . A hall of mirrors . Simple , full-length mirrors . <p> DR . SANGER So what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not grow outside a human body . That human bodies can not grow outside nature 's grand design . <p> A FAT MAN , supporting his bulk with a walking stick , grunts - <p> THE FAT MAN So what the hell are we doing here ? <p> DR . SANGER Let 's say one day you go to your doctor for a checkup . He discovers you have imminent renal failure and require a kidney transplant . What would you do ? <p> THE FAT MAN I would n't do nothing . My brother 'd give me one of his . Or else . <p> DR . SANGER Even if your brother 's kidney is with-out defect , there 's still a 38% chance of rejection . Or less if he 's your twin . <p> THE FAT MAN He 's not . He 's older . <p> DR . SANGER But what if you did have a twin ? <p> Off the fat man 's confused look , Sanger smiles and gently coaxes him to face a mirror . Their reflections stare back at them . <p> DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you not just one of his kidneys , but both ? In fact , any organ or body part you ever had cause to need ? <p> THE FAT MAN What ? You mean like a clone ? I thought you said all that stuff was a bust . <p> DR . SANGER I said the problem with a clone is it does n't survive infancy . The solution is to find a different starting point . Why sow the seed when you can create the fruit ? Or what we like to call ... an " agnate " . <p> Lydia starts clapping. , then stops , realizing this was n't a cue . <p> DR . SANGER An agnate is sequenced from a point on the cellular timeclock . It is spawned post-maturate . It is created ' adult . <p> DR . SANGER ( cont 'd ) Of course , its brain is still vestigial so for the first three years we keep it in suspension . During which time we use data impression to supply a template for functionality - a process we call " foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containment " where it enters the conditioning process . An ongoing series of quality controls designed to test and maintain its functionality . After a minimum of two years conditioning , the agnate becomes eligible for harvest ... ( to the FAT MAN , smiling ) And you , my friend , get your new kidney . <p> A hush falls among the group as they process what they 've heard . It 's a sign of the times that none of them seems to be horrified . <p> THE FAT MAN Let me see if I got this straight . You can create this whatever ... this walking spare parts holder ... but I got ta wait five years to get hold of em ? <p> DR . SANGER The spare parts , as you put it , need to be tested for integrity . But as many of our clients leave it till late in life to take out the policy , we do offer the option for early harvest . Given the risks , however , a waiver is required . <p> THE FAT MAN So five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> DR . SANGER And what if the organ you needed was a heart ? Ask yourself , each of you . If you had to put a price on your life , your very survival - what would it be ? <p> A deep lull as the group considers this . Sanger picks his moment . <p> DR . SANGER It 's a question your insurance company has already answered . For them , the agnate obviates costly and ineffective treatment programs . Should you decide to take out our policy , not only will they lower your existing premiums but they 'll also cover the production cost . <p> The incentive ripples across the faces . A troubled one speaks up- <p> # TOUR MEMBER # This " agnate " ... what happens to it ? After our friend here gets his kidney . <p> DR . SANGER That 's entirely his decision . Our role is intermediary . We , as the insurance provider , guarantee the condition and availability of the agnate but all other rights are retained . In legal terms , the policy holder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in effect , becoming sponsorship payments , maintaining the agnate until such time as harvest is required . At such time and where feasible , the sponsor has the option to extend sponsorship , retaining the agnate for secondary harvest or , shall we say , let the policy expire . <p> # TOUR MEMBER # Expire ? You mean ... let it die ? <p> DR . SANGER No . Not as you and I know it , at least . The associations of life and death are no more applicable to an agnate than to a cow in a field . It exists in a state of limited consciousness - aware not of life but of functionality . Imbued with the knowledge to maintain its function but without the capacity to question it . And yet , in many ways , the end if the most humane part of the process . The agnate goes to harvest without any fore-boding and is painlessly returned to the sleep from whence it came . Eternal or otherwise . There is mortality for an agnate . Just utility and redundancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It does n't know its ... its purpose in life ? <p> DR . SANGER Who does know my friend ? Who among us knows our true purpose in life ? <p> Sanger ambles on , plunged in thought . Lydia picks up the slack- <p> # LYDIA # This month we 're offering a special rate for new sponsors . Including a 10% discount on the his-and-hers plan . <p> She ushers the group round another corner . Another holoframe and another commercial , displaying the same characters as the first ; The old man with the walking frame is now running in a park  - -  The woman with the mastectomy is now at a party , her cocktail dress broadcasting a full cleavage  --  The young mother is now in a waiting room , smiling as a doctor hands her a newborn baby . <p> # LYDIA # Dr. Sanger ? Would you like to close ? <p> DR . SANGER Yes ... Now some of you may be thinking this commercial is staged . But these are not actors , these are past customers . Real people enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at The Sanger Institute is not just health insurance but indemnity . What we offer is the chance of a new lease on life ... <p> The tour group applauds , this time without prompting from Lydia . <p> DR . SANGER Now Lydia will walk you through the rest of the tour and explain the various limitations and exclusions . But I do have time for a few questions . <p> Hands are raised . A waspish-looking woman butts ahead of them- <p> # THE WASP # The commercial . The girl with the baby . What is that ? A fix for infertility ? <p> DR . SANGER You mean the maternity plan ? No . Not endemic infertility at least . As I said , the law prohibits genetic alteration so a defect endemic in a sponsor will also be present in their agnate . No , what the maternity plan provides is a way round the risks and rigors of childbirth . Under this plan , an agnate becomes eligible for pregnancy shortly after foundation . A simple donation of sperm from the father , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # THE WASP # And then what ? You get it in the mail ? <p> DR . SANGER For practical reasons , delivery is handled by your healthcare provider . <p> # THE WASP # And " the agnate " - what happens to it ? When it 's , you know - delivered . <p> DR . SANGER The same rule applies . You can continue your sponsorship . Or not . And in this case , there 's a natural window for compliance as the agnate is routinely sedated after delivery . As to whether it wakes up from that sleep , like I said , the choice is yours ... <p> # THE WASP # ( beat , a shrug ) Anything to avoid stretch-marks , right ? <p> The other tour members , some more guiltily than others , laugh . <p> 23 EXT . PROCESSING PLANT <p> Air blasts up from the same giant tunnel , swallowing the laughs . <p> 24 INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT <p> The acoustic hollowing as we look up from the now empty catwalk . The blast of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 25 INT . CONTAINMENT <p> The thrum fading to silence . A flat , measured silence as we revisit the community in soundless montage . The residential block , the frosted facades . The nutrition plaza , the counters , the chutes . The subway , the moving walkways . Centerville , the buildings now emitting a trickle of agnates , ending their workday - unwitting participants in their own greater utility . <p> 26 INT . DIRECTOR 'S OFFICE - CENTERVILLE <p> A glass wall looks down on the avenue . The furniture is trans-parent , ethereal . Merrick sits at a console desk studying an etherboard . Off a buzz , he taps a button . The door opens and Lincoln enters , composing a deadpan . He does n't like this man . <p> # LINCOLN # You wanted to see me ? <p> # MERRICK # Yes . Please , take a seat . <p> He taps a button . The glass wall frosts over . It 's unnerving but Lincoln stays deadpan , moving the chair before taking a seat . Merrick reviews the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scroll of data . Then he looks up , forming a smile- <p> # MERRICK # How 's Lincoln Six-Echo today ? <p> Lincoln shrugs , noncommittal . Merrick eyes him thoughtfully . <p> # MERRICK # Everything going okay ? <p> # LINCOLN # I guess not . <p> # MERRICK # Why do you say that ? <p> # LINCOLN # If I 'm here . <p> # MERRICK # I 'm not sure I deserve such a negative association . My job 's only to see that you 're happy . That everything 's okay . <p> # LINCOLN # Right . <p> # MERRICK # It sounds like you do n't believe me . <p> # LINCOLN # Why would n't I ? <p> # MERRICK # ( sits back , smiling ) It 's part of your makeup . To challenge things . To question what 's around you . <p> # LINCOLN # Ah . <p> # MERRICK # Perhaps you can utilize that facility by helping me solve a little puzzle . <p> Lincoln shifts , feeling uneasy . Merrick consults the etherboard- <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - pro-ficient at work , exercising rigorously , your last medical puts you in excellent condition . But screening 's picked up some deviations . Trace levels , changes in your sleep pattern ... I see you 've also been burning up your quotas ... <p> # LINCOLN # Are you saying I 'm contaminated ? <p> # MERRICK # No . <p> # LINCOLN # Then what 's the problem ? <p> # MERRICK # There are parameters , Lincoln . When someone starts straying from those parameters , we need to find out why . <p> # LINCOLN # Why ? <p> # MERRICK # Because you - not just you , all of our residents - are special . Because people like me do n't get to go to The Island . <p> He smiles . Lincoln stays deadpan , wondering where this is going . <p> # MERRICK # So tell me , have you noticed any changes in yourself ? <p> # LINCOLN # No . <p> # MERRICK # What about your sleep pattern ? You feel you 've been sleeping properly ? <p> Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it another way , when you wake up , do you feel ... disrupted ? <p> # LINCOLN # Disrupted ? <p> # MERRICK # Restless , disoriented , uneasy ... <p> # LINCOLN # I do n't know . <p> # MERRICK # They 're all words in your vocabulary . I know you understand what they mean . <p> Lincoln 's jaw clenches , patronized . Merrick notes this , resumes- <p> # MERRICK # Quotas ... nutrition . Do you feel like you want more than you 're given ? <p> # LINCOLN # I do n't know . <p> # MERRICK # Do you have any difficulty staying focused ? At work , for instance ? <p> Lincoln 's jaw twitches . Merrick notes this , proceeds with care- <p> # MERRICK # Have you been experiencing feelings , sensations you do n't quite understand ? <p> # LINCOLN # I do n't know . <p> # MERRICK # Do you sometimes feel agitated for no apparent reason ? Frustrated , angry ... <p> # LINCOLN # That 's it . <p> # MERRICK # Angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> # MERRICK # When exactly do you feel angry ? <p> # LINCOLN # Now ... <p> Lincoln leans forward as if to assert this . Merrick slowly nods like he 's just revealed something . He taps the etherboard- <p> # MERRICK # I 'm going to order some tests at The Medical Center . In the meantime , I 'd like you to stay away from stimulants - protein , sugar , caffeine ... <p> # LINCOLN # I already burned up my quotas . <p> # MERRICK # But I know you can get around them . <p> He levels a knowing look . Lincoln stiffens again , unsettled . <p> # MERRICK # I 'm asking you to cooperate . Not for my sake , Lincoln , but for your own . <p> # LINCOLN # Is that it ? <p> # MERRICK # There is one other thing . You have a female friend . " Ester " . Your file shows you 've been interacting regularly . <p> # LINCOLN # There 's no law against friendship . <p> # MERRICK # Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be of mutual benefit . But given these deviations ... let 's just say proximity becomes an issue . <p> # LINCOLN # I know the rules of proximity . <p> # MERRICK # The rules of proximity apply to sexual contact , Lincoln . In this case it goes deeper than that . Ester is entering her second trimester . A time of change and emotional confusion . Further inter-action might be ... unhealthy for you . <p> Lincoln , patronized , looks away . This pill he wo n't swallow . <p> # MERRICK # And for Ester - well , she has only six months left to delivery . Then she 'll move out to The Island and whatever ties she has here will be broken . <p> MERRICK ( cont 'd ) As a friend , should n't you make her transition as painless as possible ? <p> Lincoln 's deadpan falters . This one , a bitter pill , he swallows . <p> # MERRICK # Good . Now I 'm also going to refill your pleasure quota . It may help to settle you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel much better now . <p> # MERRICK # I 'm not sure you do . But I think you 'll do what 's right , Lincoln . You may not trust me . But I trust you . <p> 27 INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - CENTERVILLE - EVENING <p> A theater in the round . The audience is mostly pregnant females and older residents . As the lights dim , eyes turn to the stage . Speakers bring up Handel 's Ombra Mai Fu . Then a glowing mist rises , condensing into a huge sphere , like a seed . Known as a " holomorph " , it reacts sonically , germinating into stems and branches and blossoms , growing and evolving with the music . The diaspora is as spellbinding as it is pacifying . It is beautiful . <p> 28 INT . FOYER - COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING <p> The music from within is like a warm beckoning hand . The foyer is slightly vaulted to accommodate a statue . On a bench at its foot , Ester sits alone , waiting patiently . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seems more sullen than usual . <p> # LINCOLN # Sorry I 'm late . <p> # ESTER # It 's okay . I was waiting to tell you something anyway . Guess what ? <p> Lincoln looks at her , unsettled by her flourishing smile . <p> # ESTER # My baby - I felt it move . And it 's the weirdest feeling too . I ca n't explain it . It 's like being more ... more here . <p> Lincoln returns a deadpan look . Ester 's smile wavers a little . <p> # ESTER # I 'm sorry . I 'm all excited and we 're supposed to be finding peace of mind . <p> # LINCOLN # I have to cancel , Ester . <p> His voice is expressionless . Ester shrugs , refreshing her smile . <p> # ESTER # So I 'll see you at breakfast tomorrow ? <p> # LINCOLN # I do n't think so . <p> Ester 's smile falls . Her eyes , reaching , trying to understand . <p> # ESTER # Did I do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A small word but it comes heavily . Before Ester can ask another question , Lincoln turns and leaves . His jaw , clenching with the effort of self-containment . Ester watches him , not hurt , just a little confused . We widen to encompass the height of the statue . The likeness is idealized but unmistakably that of Dr. Sanger . <p> 29 INT . PLEASURE CENTER - NIGHT <p> Blue light . Lincoln walks up a long corridor , carrying a sealed plastic bag . Along the walls , poster-sized screens like those in the bar , display images of women , gyrating , licking their lips . <p> 30 INT . PLEASURE CELL - NIGHT <p> The blue light sustains . To one side is a mirrored wall , known as an " etherwall " . It is currently pixellated to display a grid of women 's faces , artificial consorts waiting to be selected . Facing the etherwall is a large aquarium-like tank , filled with gelatinous blue liquid . This vessel is known as a " sense tank " . <p> Lincoln sits at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He couples it to a hose dangling from the ceiling . Then lowers himself into the tank . On the inner facet , a touchlight keypad resolves . Lincoln taps some keys and the etherwall acknowledges : <p>  --  PLEASURE PARTNER SELECTED ; PROGRAM COMMENCING ... <p> Lincoln looks out at the etherwall . The faces blink off to leave him staring at his reflection . Just one left , a pouting redhead , who licks her lips in anticipation as the lights dim . <p> A holographic mist now rises . First resolving a proxy of Lincoln , naked , replicating his posture in the tank . Then the redhead is conjured , her buxom nudity glimpsed through the swirling mist . <p> Lincoln proxy reaches out to stroke redhead proxy 's breast . In the tank , Lincoln 's fingers caress only the gel , his fingertips met by soft arcs of light - neurological charges , conducted by the gel , creating the sense of touch . They are known as " impulse arcs " . Redhead proxy responds , dappling her lips across Lincoln proxy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln 's throat , then down his chest , descending to more erogenous zones . Lincoln stiffens and closes his eyes , yielding to the sensation . <p> The sensation engulfing him , Lincoln 's brow starts to furrow . Not with ecstasy . Something darker . His eyes open , his pupils fixed in a black dilated stare . Resisting the artificiality , his face forming a sneer , tightening until ... he slams his palm into the touchpad . The tank shakes . The proxies blink out . Lincoln stands mirrored in the etherwall . His hand , pressed against the glass in a posture of defiance . His reflection , warped and shuddering . <p> 31 INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT <p> From darkness grows a seed of light . Red light , pulsing to reveal the shaft , lined by lode-poles , here in triangulated relay . The polarity cradles a dark mass towards us . An elevator in descent . <p> 32 INT . DIRECTOR 'S OFFICE <p> Merrick is at his console , working late . Off a buzz , he taps a button . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square set , hollow , remote eyes . His hair is damp and he wears post-decon scrubs . A USMC ring is visible on his finger . His name is SCHEER . <p> # MERRICK # Karl ... Welcome back . <p> Scheer pauses , his face twitching . Then sneezes violently . <p> # SCHEER # I forgot how much I hate the air here . <p> # MERRICK # Just a histamine reflex . Your system 's readjusting to the sterile environment . <p> # SCHEER # It 's the smell I hate . Empty . <p> # MERRICK # Yes , well I cut short your leave for a reason . I take it you 've been briefed ? <p> # SCHEER # ( sits , sniffing ) One of our lab rats is missing . <p> With a dour look , Merrick slots his etherboard into a dock . A proxy resolves over the console , quarter scale , spinning in 3D ; male , African American , bull neck . Data etches across thin air : <p>  --  PRODUCT ID : STARKWEATHER ; FOUNDATION : II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // CONTAINMENT REF : 102 , SECTOR 4 <p> # MERRICK # His name is Starkweather Two-Delta . He dropped off the ether two days ago . At first we thought it was a system error . Then we found this in a garbage chute . <p> He opens a drawer and pulls out an ethercuff . He hands it to Scheer who considers it remotely for a few seconds . Then- <p> # SCHEER # Delta generation , huh ? <p> # MERRICK # That 's right . <p> # SCHEER # It was a Delta the last time . <p> # MERRICK # That was entirely different . The product suffered a head injury . <p> # SCHEER # What happened to this one ? <p> # MERRICK # We do n't know . He just disappeared . <p> # SCHEER # Not easy to disappear .

Merrick hardens- <p> # MERRICK # If you bothered to read the clone laws , you 'd realize we have no choice in the matter . The virtual humanity statutes accord them a set of freedoms . All we can do is prescribe the limits . And even those are subject to regulation . Scope of knowledge , range of activity , even their speech patterns . The law requires that what is of human origin be provided with human characteristics . <p> # SCHEER # You mean , like fallibility ? <p> Merrick pauses . He 's not going to take the bait . <p> # MERRICK # The ether shows no attempts on the boundary . He 's here , Karl . But for some reason , your men seem unable to find him .

An order we ca n't fill . Damn right I 'm sensitive . <p> # SCHEER # Alright . How much time do I have ? <p> Merrick taps a button . A holoframe appears beside the proxy . Even in two dimensions , the face is identical . Just a different hairstyle and a gold earring . This is the face of The Sponsor . <p> # MERRICK # Jamil Starkweather ... last week he sustained a hepatic trauma resulting in liver hemorrhage . In medical terms , we have maybe a few weeks . In legal terms , we 're already on borrowed time ... ( as Scheer rises to leave ) And Karl ? <p> MERRICK ( cont 'd ) I do n't want a godawful mess like the last time . Minimal damage . Understood ? <p> 33 INT . LINCOLN 'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN <p> The horizon . The green mountains cast black by the predawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in yesterday 's clothes , sleepless . He is staring fixedly out of the window , hungrily , as if inviting the outer darkness to come in . <p> His gaze lowers onto his jacket , slung across the bed . He digs in the pocket . And pulls out the cigarette pack . For a moment he considers it . Then slowly , purposefully , he opens it . He slips a cigarette between his lips . And lights up . He leans back , taking a slow drag . Exhaling , he watches the smoke rise . His gaze rests on the etherscreen above , expectant . The cursor comes to life : <p>  --  SCREENING ... CONTAMINANT DETECTED : ADVISING SANITATION CTRL <p> Reflected in the ceiling , Lincoln grins at his small victory . <p> 34 INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR <p> Quiet , empty at this hour .

Then he stubs out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 35 INT . THE ETHER GRID <p> A blue dot blinks in space . We widen to establish its locus on a tomograph . Now building the boxes , the quadrants , the sectors . Revealing a vast , fully dimensional hologram of containment . It spins in the vaulted chamber like a giant geometrical phantom . <p> 36 INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM <p> Overlooking the ether , like a studio control booth . Known as " Ethercon " , it 's also the title of the Censor at the console . Scheer stands over him , now in a white censor uniform with black chevrons on the sleeves , marking his seniority . He instructs- <p> # SCHEER # Reverse map . Crop to twelve hour segments . Then put up a sub-grid . <p>  --  STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA : ETHER HISTORY ; REVERSE MAPPING ... <p> To one side , a miniature of the ether grid resolves . It peppers with a series of blue dots .

NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - PREDAWN <p> The glass wall reprises the predawn glower . The plaza is empty at this hour . But the service counters are staffed as breakfast is being prepared . The clerk looks surprised to see Lincoln arriving so early . He seems grim , latent , stiffly swiping his ethercuff over the scanner . She eyes the readout on her screen- <p> # NUTRITION CLERK # Lincoln Six-Echo ... Options are dried fruit , oatmeal or anything in bran . <p> # LINCOLN # I want some bacon . <p> # NUTRITION CLERK # You heard the options . <p> # LINCOLN # And coffee . I want coffee . <p> The clerk sighs and taps her screen . Turning to the chutes , she collects a foil covered bowl and a juice can and sets them on Lincoln 's tray . Lincoln glances down at it , then back up- <p> # LINCOLN # This is n't what I asked for . <p> # NUTRITION CLERK # You want to get into it ? Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meal and make sure it goes down on your record . <p> Lincoln nods slowly . Then picks up the bowl . And flings it across the plaza . Then the juice can , trying to outdistance the bowl . Finally , the tray , which rotors almost to the far side before clattering into obscurity . Then he turns back to the clerk- <p> # LINCOLN # Put that on my fucking record . <p> 38 INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR <p> The latticed wall of ethergates . The rising beat of footfalls as Lincoln approaches . He swipes his ethercuff over the scanner . The gate slowly hisses open . Too slowly for Lincoln , who kicks it and barges his way through , leaving the gate to shudder on its hinge . <p> 39 INT . SUBWAY PLATFORM <p> The walkways , unmoving . The platform , deserted . The echoing beat of footfalls as Lincoln marches up to the vending machine . He swipes his ethercuff over the scanner . A screen illuminates : <p>  --  SUGAR QUOTA EXCEEDED ; ACCESS DENIED <p> Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anger . Erupting , he lashes out , punching the machine . He winces as his knuckles crack . Then grabs the machine , trying to rip it off the wall . Pulling , straining , sneering with effort , until- <p> He lets go with a defeated gasp . Then kicks the machine in final affront . The machine resounds with a dull boom . For a moment , he stands there , chest heaving . Then suddenly traps his breath ... <p> There , in the fading boom , a noise . Faint , rhythmic . Becoming discernible as THE SOUND OF A MAN SOBBING . Lincoln turns toward the platform . Tracing the sound , he crosses to the safety fence . <p> # LINCOLN # Hello ? <p> His voice echoes to nothing . He leans over the fence and peers up the tunnel . There . In the fog of darkness , a figure . A figure paused , half-standing , like an animal on the brink of flight . <p> The figure seems to stare at him . Then pulls upright . Now moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American , bull-necked , eyes wild and bloodshot . A stranger to Lincoln , we know him as STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA . His voice is quivering , unhinged- <p> # STARKWEATHER # Please ... <p> Lincoln stands , frozen by the sight of this dark , dishevelled resident . As he climbs up onto the platform , we see his hands , the fingertips grated and bloody . He lumbers towards Lincoln- <p> # STARKWEATHER # Please , you have to help me ... <p> He rushes forward , grabbing Lincoln , pulling him face-close- <p> # STARKWEATHER # YOU CA N'T LET THEM TAKE ME ! <p> The stranger 's eyes grow darkly , his pupils abysmal , black with dilation . Lincoln fiercely shrugs off his grip , backing away ... <p> # LINCOLN # Who are you ? What 's wrong with you ? <p> The stranger 's eyes bore into him , obsidian . Face contorting , baring his teeth like a rabid dog . Suddenly he lunges at Lincoln- <p> - BOOM-  ramming him back into the vending machine - Lincoln is stunned - suddenly a vice-like grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , webbing at the impact ... <p> For a moment , all is a blur . Teetering , Lincoln props himself against the wall . Then his focus resolves on the etherscreen and his fractured reflection . He releases a deep , bewildered breath . Then he notices his wrist . His ethercuff is missing , his skin , grazed red from abrasion . Confusion yielding to anger , he looks for his assailant . But the platform is empty . His jaw clenches . <p> 40 INT .

The gate hisses open and he barrels through , suddenly spurred by  --  <p> LINCOLN BURSTING UP from the well of walkways , charging forward like a bull . The gate now closing , Lincoln races for the gap , barging his way through . And the gate snaps shut with a CLANG . <p> 41 INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM <p> AN ALARM SOUNDS . The console flashes .

You hooked the wrong one ! <p> He crouches to examine Lincoln . Blood is blossoming from a wound on his shoulder , jutting from which is a projectile . The censor presses its base and it snaps loose of its unintended target . <p> Now we see the projectile more clearly . A fat metal pellet , snub-nosed , finned at the tail by four metal teeth . On impact , the nose recesses to release a springload and the teeth snap forward to bite into the target . This device is known as a " hookhead " . <p> # CENSOR # Just a flesh wound .

Flood the area . <p> ANOTHER ANGLE ; Floor level , as between the tiles , tiny red lights start blinking , rippling forward in a wave . Known as " lode-pins " their small magnetic pulses accumulate into a low level stream . <p> The hookheads clawed in Starkweather 's back also start blinking red . The invisible stream flowing beneath his feet , Starkweather feels its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run reducing to a slipsliding stagger . Then his feet leave the ground . He flails for a handhold . But there 's nothing . The force lifts him a foot clear off the ground before balancing out to dangle him in mid-air , squirming about like a fish on a hook . <p> ANOTHER ANGLE ; Scheer advances to reel in his catch . The stream bows before him , red lights blinking out . Until all that remains is the section where Starkweather hangs suspended . Scheer stops at its limit , looking up at him like some curious zoo exhibit . <p> SCHEER ( INTO HEADSET ) Hood him , cuff him , patch the bleed . Then let 's get him up to Level Three . <p> ANOTHER ANGLE : looking down from high above as the Censors move in on Starkweather .

The news of the incident is spreading . Off a series of chimes , eyes turn to the glass wall , now pixellating into an outsider 's face - calm , official . THE COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER begins- <p> # COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER # Good morning - this is a community bulletin ... Following an incident in Sector Four earlier this morning , The Department of Sanitation is issuing an all-sector contamination warning ... <p> TRACKING the rapt concern of the residents , Ester among them . <p> # COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER # The incident involved a resident found to be infected with a pathogen . While the risk is assessed , residents are advised to be aware of the symptoms . Should you experience aberrant levels of anxiety or witness it in others , immediately contact The Medical Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proxy of Starkweather spins over the desk . Merrick regards it with a frown . Scheer sits turning the ethercuff in his fingers with a demeanor of cool curiosity . Underneath , he 's rattled . <p> # SCHEER # You want to tell me what 's going on ? <p> # MERRICK # There 's nothing going on , Karl . <p> # SCHEER # I 'm jaded . Not stupid . <p> # MERRICK # What 's your point ? <p> # SCHEER # I checked up . In the past year , three products have destabilized . All of them Deltas ... and there 's nothing going on ? <p> # MERRICK # You 're jumping to conclusions . <p> # SCHEER # Once I can overlook . Twice I can call coincidence . Three times I start giving a shit . Because if these products are defective ... <p> # MERRICK # Quality control is not your concern . <p> # SCHEER # So it is a quality control issue ? <p> # MERRICK # That 's not what I said . <p> # SCHEER # He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , no food , no water . His fingers were scraped to the bone . He was trying to dig his way out . Now you try to explain to me why that is . <p> His look says he smells a rat . Merrick weighs him a moment . Then sighs , a little depleted . He gets up and crosses to the glass wall . Looks down on the avenue , at the agnates milling beneath . <p> # MERRICK # It 's not an exact science - biogenesis . There 's a degree of trial and error . If the agnate does n't come together on the first pass , we have to abort and start over . It 's like breaking inertia . The bioreactor , the growth medium - we just keep upping the levels till we achieve integration . At which stage the agnate is deemed physically stable . We rely on foundation to provide mental stability - matching the templates to their capacity but walling it in with parameters . ( beat , considers the proxy ) When signs of instability started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole in the wall , an oversight . But it was only happening in the later generat-ions . Which pointed back to biogenesis . <p> # SCHEER # So there was a production defect . <p> # MERRICK # Actually the opposite . We found out in the later generations , the levels were so high that when we broke inertia , the process kept going . Over-integrating . Specifically the neural system . It produced a condition called synesthesia . <p> # SCHEER # Synesthesia ... <p> # MERRICK # A fusion of the senses , creating a component awareness . Sixth sense , second sight , whatever you want to call it . Its emergence seems to be arbitrary . But it gives them experiences beyond their functional parameters . And ultimately ... it destabilizes them . However , if we catch it early enough we can control it with re-conditioning . <p> Scheer absorbs this with a slow grin . Merrick looks puzzled . <p> # MERRICK # You find this amusing ? <p> # SCHEER # Poetic . <p> # MERRICK # Poetic ? <p> # SCHEER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsor placed an order . Maybe he got the sense his days were numbered ... <p> Merrick 's composure cracks a little . He had n't thought of this . <p> # MERRICK # This stays between you and me , Karl . I trust I can rely on your cooperation ? <p> # SCHEER # Do n't you mean my complicity ? <p> # MERRICK # ( hardening again ) Remind me , why is it you were discharged from the military ? <p> # SCHEER # What 's your point ? <p> # MERRICK # Learn to be a team player , Karl . Or you 'll find yourself out of another job . <p> Scheer rises , discarding the ethercuff onto Merrick 's desk . <p> # SCHEER # Nobody else would take it . <p> 49 INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT <p> The deep steady thrum of the extractor fans . We are TIGHT ON the frame of an airlock . Hissing , it indents and opens . Lincoln steps through , eyes black and uncanny . The tri-key glinting , dangling from his fingers . Scanning around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipes off some soot . Legible beneath is a number . Twenty . He assimilates this . Then turns his gaze up the extractor shaft . <p> 50 INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT <p> Looking up an elevator shaft . The red pulse of the lode-poles , rippling downward as an elevator descends from the surface . <p> 51 INT . OUTER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE <p> A tiled chamber . Draped off cubicles . The elevator doors slide open . An outsider emerges , dressed in a flightsuit , emblazoned " Medical Courier " . He announces himself , seemingly to no one- <p> # THE COURIER # Clearance code : NG-230-2DS . <p> VOICE ON SPEAKER New Gaza Healthcare . Okay , you 're clear . Go ahead and get undressed . <p> 52 INT . DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER <p> The pressure door hisses , heaving open . The courier steps inside , naked , covering his genitals , some goggles slung around his neck . He takes position on two marked footpads and puts on the goggles- <p> # THE COURIER # I tell you , I hate this fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> VOICE ON SPEAKER Try full-course decontamination . It 's even more fun . Especially the colonics . <p> The lights blink out . A red glow rises . Twin planes of light scrape across the courier , infra-red , searing his epidermis . <p> 53 INT . INNER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE <p> A chamber like the first . The inner pressure door hisses open . The courier emerges , dripping wet from a decon shower . He goes to a cubicle , grabbing a towel and dries himself off . Laid out within are some scrubs . Beside them is A STEEL COOLER , inset with a thermostat and embossed with the crosshatch insignia . <p> 54 INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL THREE <p> The courier strolls up the corridor , now dressed in the scrubs and carrying the cooler . He turns a corner and his footsteps gradually fade out . A flat , sterile silence falls in his wake . <p> A metal squeal . A ventilation grid levers down from the ceiling . A pause . Then a pair of feet drop through , legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sweaty , smeared black with dust . For a moment he looks around to get his bearings . Suddenly he freezes , hearing- <p> A VOICE ( O.S. ) Check in at the nurse 's station . Up the corridor , left , then first right . <p> The footsteps are now coming back . Lincoln spins round . He finds a door . A lock panel . A moment of panic . Then he fumbles the tri-key from his pocket , hurriedly slotting it into the lock panel . <p> 55 INT . THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR - SECONDS LATER <p> Lincoln waits , ear to the door , listening as the footsteps pass and fade out of earshot . Lincoln releases his breath in relief , calming a little , then frowning as he registers another sound . <p> Very faint , rhythmic . He turns and looks around . The room is in partial shadow . To one side is a row of seats , to the other , a row of windows , covered by blinds , light creasing through . The sound repeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BABY . <p> 56 INT . HARVEST ROOM <p> A grid of bio-readouts , each square alive with graphs and digits . The familiar baseline of a cardiograph . A lever-arm mounted with an IV reservoir , dangling tubes and wires onto the OR table . <p> We see A DOCTOR and A MIDWIFE , in whose arms A NEWBORN BABY squirms and bawls . Lying on the table , we see THE MOTHER , her feet up in stirrups , deeply flushed and puffing from exertion . Marked by her crosshatch as an agnate , she has just given birth- <p> THE AGNATE MOTHER May I hold her ? <p> # THE DOCTOR # We have to run a few tests on her first . In the meantime , I 'm going to give you something to help you relax , okay ? <p> Off his smile , the agnate mother nods , anxiously watching the midwife wrap her baby in blanket . The doctor taps a button and watches the IV reservoir misting with a pale colored fluid . <p> The cardiograph marks the drop as the fast-acting sedative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midwife takes her baby from the room . Then the cry of the newborn is shut out . <p> Just the cardiograph now , the beeps evening out , the scart of peaks shallowing as the agnate mother falls asleep . The doctor taps a button . On the grid , the face of a DESK NURSE appears . <p> # THE DOCTOR # I 'm incubating the baby for 24 hours prior to transport . But go ahead and contact the sponsor . Tell her she has a beautiful baby girl . <p> The nurse nods . The grid square goes blank . A pause . Then the doctor taps another button . Text appears . Reading it , he cites- <p> # THE DOCTOR # Let the record show the sponsor has signed Clause 22 of The Basic Sponsor-ship Agreement . Initiate compliance . <p> A light starts blinking . The doctor walks stiffly out of the room . The door hisses closed . The agnate mother is left alone . Sleeping peacefully , blind to the fluid now seeping into her IV . Deaf to the slowing beep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spacing , fading , slowing , slowing , until ... <p> The cardiograph flatlines . And a sepulchral stillness falls . Our angle widens with the growing emptiness . The lifelessness . <p> 57 INT . OBSERVATION ROOM <p> Lincoln looks down from above , eyes frozen in the slatted light . His fingers are trembling , rattling the blinds against the glass . <p> 58 INT . CORRIDOR <p> Lincoln tumbles out of the door . He ca n't breathe , ca n't think , his mind is in overload . He stumbles around like a wounded animal . His focus suddenly and searingly returns as he hears- <p> DESK NURSE ( O.S. ) Starkweather ? Like the football player ? <p> 59 INT . NURSES STATION - LEVEL THREE - CONTINUOUS <p> A rotunda spoked by corridors . A console at its hub , manned by the desk nurse we saw earlier . The courier stands over her- <p> # THE COURIER # That 's right . Starkweather . <p> # DESK NURSE # Still showing in surgery . Sorry . <p> # THE COURIER # Honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in . How long 's it gon na be ? <p> 60 INT . ANOTHER OPERATING ROOM <p> Another grid of readouts . Another cardiograph beeps . A spotlamp illuminates the OR table and STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA - his face , slack with anesthesis , eyes rolling a little beneath the lids . The rest of him under a sheet , cut out over the belly , the flesh slit and parted by a clamp , framing a window into his innards . <p> Standing over him , mid-operation , A SURGEON and SURGICAL TECH . Interrupted by a chime , the surgeon looks up at a screen , where a panel flashes : " PAGING " . He cradles his bloody gloves and elbows a button . The face of the desk nurse resolves on screen- <p> DESK NURSE ( ON SCREEN ) The courier 's here for pickup . <p> # THE SURGEON # Well he 's going to have to wait a while . It took forever to put this one under . <p> SURGICAL TECH ( O.S. ) Doctor ... <p> DESK NURSE ( ON SCREEN ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of storm moving in . <p> # THE SURGEON # For Christ 's sake , is that my fault ?

Boost the anaesthetic lev ... <p> Suddenly he 's sprayed with blood as the clamp springs loose from the stomach , clattering to the floor . He 's frozen by shock as ... <p> Starkweather sits bolts upright . Dazed , he looks at the surgeon , the tech , then down at his wide-open stomach . Instinctively , he clutches it . Then , his mind assimilating the horror , he SCREAMS . <p> Now launching off the operating table , the lever-arm swinging out , blindsiding the tech - tubes and wires snapping loose - instruments flying - Starkweather lunges for the doorway - the surgeon steps up to block him - only to be hurled aside ... <p> 61 INT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Starkweather , clumping down the corridor , clutching his open stomach , blood streaming down his legs . He 's delirious , running nowhere , anywhere , running blind . Reaching the end of the corridor , he stops suddenly , seeing WHITE UNIFORMS . <p> He doubles back up the corridor . Kicking at doors with bare feet , frantic for any means of escape . He spots a ventilator grid , slightly open . He jumps , reaching for it . Once , twice , then his feet slip from under him . He hits the floor with a damp splat . <p> TWO CENSORS turn the corner , ready for action . But there is Starkweather , face-down in a starburst of his own blood . <p> CENSOR ( INTO HEADSET ) Yeah , no sweat , subject is secured . <p> 62 INT . DUCTING - MINUTES LATER <p> POV CEILING VENTILATOR GRID . Looking down through the slits onto Starkweather directly beneath . He now has a loose white hood over his head . His wrists and ankles are bound by plastic cuffs . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight is such that the Censors have to drag him away , leaving a bloodsmear on the floor . His guttural whimpers are the only sign of life . <p> CLOSE UP : Lincoln 's face in part shadow , looking down . The gleam of his eyes as Starkweather disappears from view . Listening now , to those feeble whimpers , growing fainter , ever fainter until they disappear from earshot . Silence again . Emptiness . All that remains of Starkweather is a wending bloodsmear on the floor . <p> SLOW FADE TO BLACK . <p> 63 INT . BEDROOM - DAWN <p> The horizon . The green mountains in different aspect , framed by a different window . The bedroom is like Lincoln 's but with a few feminine touches . Ester , in her papery pajamas , sits brushing her hair . With a chime , etherscreen scales over her reflection : <p>  --  ETHERCALL PENDING ; ACCEPT OR SEND TO MESSAGE BANK ?  --  <p> # ESTER # Accept . <p> The etherscreen resolves Lincoln 's face , dishevelled , urgent- <p> LINCOLN ( ON ETHERSCREEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # ESTER # Lincoln ? Are you okay ? I was worried . <p> LINCOLN ( ON ETHERSCREEN ) What are you talking about ? <p> # ESTER # The contamination warning .

But you ca n't tell anyone . <p> # ESTER # Is it true ? Were you contaminated ? <p> LINCOLN ( ON ETHERSCREEN ) You know where to come . <p> His face blinks out . Ester is left frowning at her reflection . <p> 64 INT . BEDROOM - LINCOLN 'S APARTMENT - DAY <p> Lincoln stares at his own mirror image . His eyes , fraught with revelation . His clothes , begrimed with dirt and blood . He rests his head against the etherscreen panel , shuddering , pressing his eyes tightly closed . As if he could ever forget what he 's seen . <p> 65 INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY <p> The routine flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed , trying to look inconspicuous . Showered , white shirt and blue slacks under his shearling , he looks a little too scrubbed , too clean . He spots a familiar figure up ahead . He catches up . <p> # LINCOLN # Jonesy ... <p> Jones lets him fall into step with a look of mild curiosity- <p> # JONES # Hey , champ . Are you alright ? I heard there was a contamination scare . <p> # LINCOLN # I saw what happened to him . <p> # JONES # What are you talking about ? <p> # LINCOLN # Starkweather ... What they did to him . <p> Jones huffs , dismissively . Lincoln grabs his shoulder , ardent- <p> # LINCOLN # They cut him open , Jonesy . They took him upstairs and they cut him open . <p> Jones holds his gaze a moment , then shrugs off his grip . <p> # JONES # You caught that fucking pathogen , did n't you ? You 're contaminated . <p> # LINCOLN # Jonesy , listen to me ... <p> But Jones just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead in his tracks . Across the avenue , TWO CENSORS are on patrol and his best friend is now heading towards them . With a barren , torn grimace , Lincoln turns away and melts back into the crowd . <p> 66 INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - CENTERVILLE - LATER <p> Rings of empty seats round the empty stage . Ester enters warily , walking up the aisle . Lincoln waits in the shadows . He checks to see she has n't been followed . Then steps forward . Ester recoils- <p> # ESTER # Please ... do n't come any closer . I do n't want to get contaminated . <p> # LINCOLN # Ester , I 'm not contaminated . <p> # ESTER # But they said ... <p> # LINCOLN # I 'm not contaminated ! <p> His shout echoes through the empty auditorium . Ester looks at him , alarmed by his vehemence . Lincoln calms himself a little- <p> # LINCOLN # Contaminants , pathogens ... it 's just what they tell us to keep us inside . <p> # ESTER # What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why they keep us here . To use us . To take things from us . <p> # ESTER # You 're not making sense . <p> # LINCOLN # Your baby ... they 're going to take your baby away ... you understand ? <p> # ESTER # My baby ?

Do n't you get it ? <p> A VOICE ( O.S. ) Nobody move ! Stay right where you are ! <p> A CENSOR steps through , stopgun levelled . Ester freezes . Lincoln hovers , mind racing . The censor moves in , tightening aim on him . <p> Ester looks on anxiously as he approaches Lincoln . Lincoln now sees the censor pulling out some plastic cuffs . The same cuffs used on Starkweather , promising the same fate ... TRIGGERING HIM  --  <p> LINCOLN LUNGES AT THE CENSOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocking the stopgun from his grasp - recoiling as  --  <p> THE CENSOR RETALIATES - driving a knee into his groin , doubling him over - then a knee to his head - THUDDING INTO HIS SKULL- <p> # ESTER # Do n't hurt him ! <p> ESTER RUNS UP grabbing at the white uniform , trying to restrain him - the censor swats her blindly - hitting her in the stomach  --  <p> LINCOLN SPINS ROUND at the sound of Ester 's yelp - only to be roundhoused by the censor - the blow sending him to the floor  --  <p> ESTER DOUBLED OVER - wincing at the pain - clutching her belly instinctively , protectively - an ominous scowl knotting her face- <p> THE CENSOR PUNISHING LINCOLN - kicking him down the aisle - then suddenly hearing a noise from behind - turning to face it as  --  <p> - BOOM-  A GUNBLAST RIPS THE AIR .

Silence - the rasp of the censor , blood foaming - another sound - FOOTFALLS . Lincoln goes to the door - an IMMINENT MASS OF WHITE UNIFORMS . He grabs Ester- <p> # LINCOLN # RUN ! ! ! <p> 67 INT .

VARIOUS CORRIDORS - CONTAINMENT INFRASTRUCTURE <p> THE CENSORS : flooding through into the maintenance corridor , in their white uniforms , they seem like a swarm of antibodies  --  <p> LINCOLN AND ESTER : deeper in , at another pressure door , fumbling the trikey into the lock . A tense second . The lock hisses open  --  <p> SCHEER : pushes through the opening gap of another pressure door , taking the lead , his Censors surging up in his wake  --  <p> LINCOLN AND ESTER : meeting an intersection , veering at random , running blind , running deeper into the faceless labyrinth  --  <p> SCHEER : catching up , hitting the intersection , pausing to split his squad in each direction - white uniforms dispersing  --  <p> LINCOLN AND ESTER : reaching another pressure door . Footsteps audible . Lincoln jams the tri-key into the lock . And waits . The seconds pass . But the door does n't open . Lincoln looks around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic then  --  <p> THE PRESSURE DOOR OPENS : not onto a corridor but an elevator car . Pulling Ester inside , Lincoln finds an array of buttons . His fingers hovers , uncertain which to press . So he punches all of them , stabbing madly , trying to prompt the door to close . <p> SCHEER : turns a corner , seeing his quarry at the far end of the corridor , he gathers pace . The elevator is closing but he does n't break stride . He deftly taps his headset , opening a channel to  --  <p> SCHEER ( ON HEADSET ) Ethercon ! The elevator - override it ! Do you read me ? Bring it back down ! <p> 71 INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM <p> Ethercon is working the console keys like a madman . His gaze flitting to a subgrid of the complex , spinning the angles , navigating the mesh of lines . His voice comes apologetically- <p> ETHERCON ( INTO HEADSET ) You 're off the grid , sir . Give me a second . Can you tell me where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the response . <p> 72 INT . CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE THE ELEVATOR <p> Scheer stands with his Censors , poised , watching the panel chart the elevator 's descent . A light flashes and the doors open . They level their stopguns on ... nothing . The elevator is empty . <p> SCHEER ( INTO HEADSET ) Foundation Levels - all of them . Lock them down . Access only on my command . <p> 73 INT . FOUNDATION LEVEL <p> A dead acoustic . A corridor paved with sound proofing panels . It ends at a pressure door , where Lincoln and Ester now arrive . Lincoln looks back to the elevator at the other end . No going back . He slots the tri-key into the lock . The door hisses open . <p> 74 INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBERS <p> Amber light . The sound of slow bubbling . Lincoln and Ester pause to adjust to the gloom . They are in a hall of windows . Ester is the first to venture forth , as if drawn , to the nearest window . <p> Behind the glass is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with various tubes pulsing matter to and fro . The tubes connect to a form . A human form , an adult form but curled foetally . It is known as a " nascent " . In this tank is a female nascent , shifting slightly , causing Ester to gasp . The nascent registers the noise , turning its head . Its eyelids are closed but its eyeballs move , questioning . A slight furrow appears on its crosshatched brow . Ester recoils in sudden horror , perhaps remembering on some deep level that this is where she came from . <p> # LINCOLN # Ester ! Come on ! <p> Spurred to action , Ester follows Lincoln onward up the hall . Still conscious of movement all around , of nascents stirring at the sound of their footfalls like the ripples of a nightmare . <p> 75 INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBER <p> A STOPGUN noses through the door . Followed by Scheer moving in silence , honed . How much time has passed is unclear . He signals his censors to split off . Tracking Scheer 's advance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sweep . Strobes of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of tanks . It angles to project a grid across each nascent 's face , then fires a short laser burst , searing a crosshatch into the brow . <p> ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER : another contingent moves up another row of foundation tanks . The nascents within have cables plugged into their ears , filaments pulsing . The nascents are in a posture of rigor , sinews straining as they accept the data impression . <p> RETURNING TO SCHEER as he reaches the end of the first chamber . No further access , just a continuing wrap of foundation tanks . He pauses , confused for a second . One of the censors comes up- <p> # CENSOR # Nothing , sir . No sign . <p> # SCHEER # They ca n't have got past this level . <p> Scheer peels off his headset , giving full leash to his senses , straining to concentrate . Seconds of pent silence . Then he hears a faint humming . His gaze slowly drifts up to a ventilator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIGHT <p> A POV LOOKING UP . The funnel mouth framing a vista of the world outside . A hostile vista of black sky , maelstroms of sand . The sound of blasting air , suborned to the giant howl of a DUSTSTORM . <p> A HAND . Reaching over the funnel lip as Lincoln pulls himself up with a mighty effort . Blinking , blinded by the sand , he swings astride the lip . Then he reaches down to pull Ester up . Ester gains the lip and likewise swings astride , coughing , blinking . <p> THE DUSTY EARTH as Lincoln leaps down to meet it . We track up as he helps Ester down from the funnel . Her feet meeting the earth , we are now in CU on their faces . Gaping and blinking at the prospect of the world outside . A world of darkness and storm . <p> SUDDEN BLINDING LIGHT as halogens explode the darkness . Lincoln shields his eyes , scanning for their source . He spots a large cubic building , banks of spotlights on the roof . He pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of darkness . <p> 77 INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT <p> THE THRUM OF EXTRACTOR FANS . Scheer pacing on a catwalk . White uniforms above and below , flashlights roving , sliced by the blades of the extractor fans . From somewhere , comes a shout- <p> CENSOR ( O.S. ) Sir ! We got em ! Motion sensors just picked them up at the surface ! <p> 78 EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT <p> ANOTHER BURST OF HALOGENS . More spotlights engage , their blaze flooding across the foreview , catching two figures ; Lincoln and Ester , running , now , veering sharply away from the light . Now disappearing from sight , dropping into the trench of the lodeway . <p> 79 INT . MAINTENANCE ELEVATOR - CONTAINMENT <p> THE RISING HUM OF THE LODE-POLES . The elevator crammed with censors . Scheer at the front , staring ahead . He looks very focused , bitterly so . The look of a man outwitted by lab rats . <p> 80 EXT . THE LODEWAY - NIGHT <p> THE DARKNESS OF THE TRENCH . Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffers . Above them , the dust flails in lashing tongues , starkly depicted by the halogens . <p> 81 EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - NIGHT <p> WHITE UNIFORMS IN THE NIGHT - censors spill forth into the halogen light , splitting in all directions . Scheer suddenly notices the corona of light from the front of the complex . He barks something inaudible to his men , launching into a run . <p> 82 EXT . THE GATEWAY - NIGHT <p> THE GATEWAY LOOMING ABOVE . Beneath , Lincoln and Ester , on their knees , clawing at the dust . Like burrowing animals , trying to widen the gap between the foot of the gate and the lodeway . <p> 83 EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT <p> A LONE WHITE UNIFORM . As Scheer reaches the forecourt , stopping to scan the spotlit view , the veils of the duststorm . His face tightening with urgency . Suddenly he taps his headset , barking- <p> SCHEER ( INTO HEADSET ) The lodeway ! Flood it ! Light it up ! <p> 84 EXT . THE GATEWAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audible over the storm . Lincoln and Ester , washed by pulsing red light . Ester recoiling , her arm flinging back from the pull . Lincoln grabbing her , his own arm straining now . The polarity tugging their ethercuffs . <p> 85 EXT . THE LODEWAY - NIGHT <p> THE RED WASH OF LIGHT from the lodeway as Scheer races up the edge , eyes trawling the trench for his quarry . His pace now suddenly dropping , slowing to a halt . He doubles over , catching his breath . More white uniforms now appear from the dust as the Censors , unable to match his pace , finally catch up . The first reaching him , Scheer pulls upright , bellowing over the wind- <p> # SCHEER # Get me a bird ! <p> # CENSOR # A bird ? ! In this storm ? ! <p> # SCHEER # They got out ! They got past the gate ! <p> Scheer spins on his heel back towards The Institute . The Censor lingers , confused . Then he fixes on the lodeway . Floating past in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethercuffs . <p> 86 EXT . THE DESERT - NIGHT <p> The perimeter wall silhouetted in the middle-distance . Lincoln and Ester scramble through the scrub , blinded by dust , driven by momentum . As Ester starts lagging behind , Lincoln grabs her arm- <p> # LINCOLN # Ester ! We have to keep going ! <p> But Ester resists him , breaking loose from his grasp . Lincoln looks at her , uncomprehending . Until he sees her expression , the harrowed stare in her eyes , the labored heaving of her chest . <p> # LINCOLN # Ester ? <p> Ester staggers back , losing balance , reeling as if spun by the storm . Her eyes widening , senses flooding . The howling wind , the swirling dustclouds , the pendent gulf of black sky . Her reel returning her to face Lincoln , Ester opens her mouth to speak . But all that comes is A SCREAM . A scream from deep within , shrill and hysterical , the only articulation she can find . Lincoln grabs her and covers her mouth . Fighting to stifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming . A scream of everything . <p> 87 INT . BEDROOM - SOMEWHERE - LATE NIGHT <p> All is still . Just a muted shudder of wind on glass . The room is in shadow . All we see is a canopied bed where a figure , obscured , lies sleeping . The still is disrupted by a chime . The figure stirs , fumbling at the nightstand . A holoframe resolves , the light revealing Dr. Sanger , rumpled by sleep . He peers into the holoframe to find the face of Merrick , gaunt with concern- <p> MERRICK ( ON HOLOFRAME ) Henry ... There 's been a breach . <p> HARD CUT TO BLACK . <p> SLOW FADE UP : <p> 88 EXT . THE RED ROCKS - DAWN <p> A horizon . A brim of dawn over the red rocks . The view is framed by the mouth of a cave . Lincoln sleeps within , slumped against the rock , his head bowed heavily . The touch of first light opens his eyes . His brow creasing , as if waking from a bad dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find himself alone . He gets up , a little shaky at first , then ventures out of the cave . <p> He emerges onto a ledge , perhaps fifty feet up . He pauses , eyes adjusting to the quality of light . He sees the storm has reduced to a low wind , combing the floorland of scrub . Now , across the ledge , he sees Ester . Perched on an outcrop , hugging her knees , watching the sunrise over the desert . He crosses and lowers to a crouch beside her . Ester turns to him with a confused frown- <p> # ESTER # Where did all the green go ? <p> Lincoln looks deep into her troubled eyes . He answers gently- <p> # LINCOLN # There is no green . The windows in there ... they were just pictures . <p> Ester absorbs this with difficulty . Lincoln rises again and stands looking out across the desert , into the barren unknown . <p> 89 EXT . THE SKY OVER THE DESERT - MORNING <p> From the massive sky grows a glinting shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its only noise is the sibilance of blades slicing air . It is known as a " whisper " . <p> 90 INT . WHISPER - MORNING <p> The pilot jockeys with the thermals . Scheer rides shotgun . Now in civvies , scanning the terrain with electronic binoculars . The flight console beeps . He taps a keypad . A holoframe resolves : <p> CENSOR ( ON HOLOFRAME ) Ground team checking in . <p> # SCHEER # Anything ? <p> CENSOR ( ON HOLOFRAME ) The storm pretty much covered their tracks . We 're scanning for thermals but the hotter it gets , the harder it is to isolate a heat signature . I do n't know , sir , it 's a big desert out there . <p> 91 EXT . CHASM - THE RED ROCKS - DAY <p> The desert sun clefts the chasm into light and shadow . Lincoln trudges into view , Ester lagging behind . He stops to let her catch up , only to watch her slump onto a rock . He allows her a moment to rest and walks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys the terrain . His eyes roam the carpet of scrub , now narrowing on an inconsistency . A faint strip where nothing seems to grow . Tracing its lineage , he walks a few feet out . Then drops to a crouch and starts clawing away at the dust . <p> His fingers meet something hard . He sweeps off the dust to expose a layer of concrete . Continuing , revealing the ghost of a line . What we might recognize as a lane marker but a curiosity to him . Continuing , opening a window in the dust . Now his fingers snag on something . He tugs it and it gives a little , dust crumbling to reveal a section of rusted chainlink . A corner of metal is visible . Lincoln exposes the rest . A sign , barely legible : " US Government - Restricted Area " . He frowns , trying to assimilate . Ester comes up to join him . Off her anxious look , he decides- <p> # LINCOLN # I think I 've found a path . <p> 92 EXT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands of fir and ponderosa pine . A whisper skims over the treecaps , circling in on a high shelf . Here , remotely nestled in a clearing , stands a glass villa . <p> 93 INT . THE GLASS VILLA - DAY <p> The flood of light , the majestic view lend an air of beatitude . The decor is minimalist with Native American accents , kokopelli spirits in carved silhouette . Dr. Sanger stands at a glass wall , looking out across the green mountain valley . On the sofa sits Merrick , now in civvies , still gaunt from worry . The air stirs as a maid ushers in A WOMAN - 30 's , all business , sharp blue eyes , a severe , mannish coiffure . Her name is ELLEN CROWNE . <p> # CROWNE # Good morning , gentlemen . <p> # SANGER # Bernard , this is Ellen Crowne from our legal department . Ellen , this is Bernard Merrick , director of products . <p> # MERRICK # Thank you for coming out here . <p> # CROWNE # Well when Henry called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social visit . <p> They settle at a table . A jug of icewater and glasses laid out . <p> # CROWNE # I understand there was an incident ? <p> # MERRICK # First , let me stress there 's no way we could have anticipated what happened ... <p> # CROWNE # We 're on the same team , Mr. Merrick . Just give me the facts down-and-dirty . <p> # MERRICK # ( uneasy , clears his throat ) We 've lost two of our products . They escaped containment last night . <p> Crowne casts a troubled look at Sanger . Merrick quickly adds- <p> MERRICK ( cont 'd ) However , we have all available resources dedicated to the search . <p> # CROWNE # How exactly did this happen ? <p> # MERRICK # We 're still piecing it together . <p> # CROWNE # Do we expect more products to escape ? <p> DR . SANGER Do n't be so alarmist , Ellen . <p> # CROWNE # I 'm sorry , Henry , but you asked me here to assess our liabilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition our products with a deterrent . A fear of contamination . And thereby of the outer environment . So to escape , they first have to escape their conditioning . <p> Crowne pauses to absorb this and to light a slim black cigarette . <p> # CROWNE # Containment is one of the terms of our state health license . The fact it was compromised could put us in violation . <p> DR . SANGER Bureaucracy . <p> # CROWNE # Henry , it was a bloody battle getting our license through in the first place . <p> DR . SANGER They 're not going to pull our license , Ellen . We have a lot of friends on the Commission . Not to mention the goodwill we earned in DC when we took over the facility ; a bunker complex for a bio-chemical war that never happened ... We relieved them of a costly embarrassment . <p> # CROWNE # I 'm not sure we can rely on that . <p> DR . SANGER Alright . What do you suggest ? <p> # CROWNE # First , I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finding them ? <p> # MERRICK # Well , in our favor , they 've never been outside containment . They 'd have no coordinates , no sense of direction . <p> # CROWNE # I do n't see how that 's in our favor . <p> # MERRICK # They 're in the middle of the desert . Food and water become an issue . <p> # CROWNE # So they might return to the trough ? <p> # MERRICK # Possibly . <p> # CROWNE # And if not ? How long could they last ? <p> # MERRICK # A few days maybe . But there is another variable . We maintain the products in a sterile environment . So basically their immune systems are untested . Toxins , pathogens , environmentals the rest of us overcome routinely , to them ... <p> DR . SANGER That 's a little drastic . Some immune systems are more adaptive than others . <p> # CROWNE # Let 's take the drastic case . What then ? <p> # MERRICK # Well ... the male , we could cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The female comes under the maternity plan . She 's three months pregnant . Even if we fast-tracked another generation , we could n't fast-track the pregnancy . We 'd miss the delivery date , the sponsor would wonder why and there would be ... difficulties . <p> Crowne looks worried . Sanger pours a glass of icewater . <p> DR . SANGER Even so , the worst may not happen . <p> # CROWNE # We have n't even touched on the worst . If these products reach a populated area , there 's the problem of scrutiny . <p> DR . SANGER Ellen , we operate under State license on a lease from the Federal Government ... <p> # CROWNE # ( cuts him off , harshly ) We slipped through a loophole in the clone laws , Henry . And they only let us through because they smelt money . And they gave us a government basement to cover their own asses not ours . It 's at the core of our license - why we screen potential sponsors , why we make them sign discretion agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit the extent of public scrutiny . <p> DR . SANGER Either way , it 's unlikely they 'd get that far . It 's at least twenty miles to the next settlement . Right , Bernard ? <p> Merrick hesitates before nodding his assent . Crowne pounces on it- <p> # CROWNE # Something to add , Mr. Merrick ? <p> # MERRICK # I just do n't think we should under-estimate them . Especially the male . <p> DR . SANGER And I do n't think we should panic . <p> He cautions Merrick with a discreet look , then shakes a pill from a bottle . Crowne looks forward to both men . Very serious . <p> # CROWNE # Gentlemen , whatever happens we need to keep one thing clearly in mind . As far as the world at large goes , we are just another medical services company . Anything that alters that perception puts us at risk . And we can not rely on the sanction of the law to protect us . Whenever and wherever and in whatever condition we recover these products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one nudge to put us in the spotlight . Then you 'll see how fast politicians can run for cover . <p> Merrick shifts , uneasy . Sanger takes the pill with a bitter smile- <p> DR . SANGER In other words we need to find them or else . That 's very astute , Ellen . <p> 94 EXT . DESERT HIGHWAY - SUNSET <p> The dust swirls and puffs across a highway of yesteryear . A dirt track but for patches of exposed concrete and angles of buckled lampposts . The empty path reaches to a blood-red sunset . <p> 95 EXT . SCRAPYARD - SUNSET <p> The dust skims over mountains of rusted scrap . Nestled in the mountains is a shack . A sign creaks in the breeze " Osmund Deer , Licensed Salvage Merchant " . On the porch sits an old man in a greasy ballcap and dungarees . This is the eponymous owner , OZZIE . <p> He 's sitting on a lounger , surveying his empire , enjoying a beer and a cigarette . Exhaling a drag of smoke , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke , silhouetted against the sunset . An approaching figure , wary , like a flighty animal . <p> # OZZIE # Hello ? <p> The silhouetted figure does n't answer , just stares back at him . <p> # OZZIE # Can I help you ? <p> This seems to get a response . The figure ventures closer . We recognize Lincoln . Exhausted , dust-covered and dry-throated - <p> # LINCOLN # My friend ... she needs water . <p> 96 INT . BACK ROOM - THE SHACK - SUNSET <p> A mass of technology and furniture from recent and distant past . Lincoln lowers Ester onto a threadbare sofa . Ozzie , excited to have visitors , bustles up with a water gallon , pouring a glass . Lincoln takes it and tips it to Ester 's lips . She coughs it out at first . Then takes the glass and starts drinking with vigor . Ozzie sets down the water gallon in front of his visitors . Then settles in an armchair and cracks open a beer . It lends the mood , albeit strained , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so . Despite which , both men have an eye on each other . <p> # OZZIE # Got stuck in that supercell , didya ? <p> Lincoln eyes him , wary of the question . Ozzie reads confusion- <p> # OZZIE # Supercell storm , that 's what they call it on the news anyways . In my day , we just called em " big ol ' howlers " . <p> Ozzie chuckles to himself . It seems to put his visitor at ease . <p> # OZZIE # Yep , I heard it shut down some of the lodeways . Dust in the works , I guess . Where were you folks headed anyways ? <p> Lincoln gulps down some water , deciding an answer . Then ventures- <p> # LINCOLN # Away . <p> # OZZIE # Away ? You mean , like outta state ? <p> # LINCOLN # " Out of state " ... <p> The term is meaningless to Lincoln but he likes the sound of it . Ozzie grins . This is starting to feel like a real social visit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm Ozzie . Osmund really . But folks call me Ozzie . <p> An awkward lull as Ozzie waits for his visitor to reciprocate . <p> # OZZIE # Sometimes I like to make a joke of it , my last name bein ' Deer ... " O. Deer " . <p> Ozzie chuckles but the pun seems lost on his visitor . He lets it drop . The awkward silence returns . Lincoln drinks the water , wondering if this strange old man is as harmless as he appears . <p> # OZZIE # Well now , looks like yer girlfriend 's made herself at home . <p> Lincoln looks at Ester , slumped over , asleep on the sofa . Ozzie puts a finger to his lips , beckoning his visitor out of the room . <p> 97 EXT . SCRAPYARD - DUSK <p> The porch light comes on , casting the scrapyard in grades of light and shadow . Ozzie steps out onto the porch , lighting a cigarette . His visitor hovering at the threshold , he offers the pack . Lincoln steps out and takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Yer girlfriend sure is pretty . <p> His visitor looks at him curiously . Ozzie misinterprets that he 's said something out of turn . Time to change the subject- <p> # OZZIE # So what 's with them tattoos , huh ? <p> He taps his forehead . Lincoln fingers his crosshatch , suddenly aware of it now and suspicious of the question . Ozzie palliates- <p> # OZZIE # Hey , in the eye of the beholder , right ? Now this place , this is beautiful to me . This is my place . I own it . May not look like much but you 'd be surprised . C'm on , lemme show you ... <p> Ozzie moseys into the scrapyard , beckoning his visitor . Lincoln hesitates , then follows him , sensing it 's better to play along . <p> # OZZIE # Mosta this heavy stuff 's industrial scrap . Comes in from all over . Easy way round the recyclin ' laws . Me , I sell it on to the boondock boys for meltdown . Other stuff , I pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a price . <p> They reach a vehicle shell . A rust-pocked chassis , canted on its axle , we might recognize it as an automobile from our own era . <p> # OZZIE # Fossil fuel transport . This piece o ' junk 's a collector 's item . All that Age of the Wheel nostalgia , " elegant era of transport " bullshit . I find the parts , she 's as good as solid gold . <p> Ozzie pats his investment and moves to another rusted metal pile . Steepled by rail tracks , we see elevator sheaves , tension cables . <p> # OZZIE # Now this here 's got a colorful history . Came in from this ol ' government bunker out in the valley . Got shut down way back . Then this new outfit took over , stripped the place out . I guess they 're doin ' some more remodelling cause I just had em in again the other day ... ( a tug of smoke , reflective ) Hump n dump crew . Nice fellas . <p> Lincoln frowns . The term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his memory has been clouded by trauma . Ozzie reads his face- <p> # OZZIE # You okay there ? <p> Lincoln looks at him , something breaking the clouds . A sense of danger , indistinct . Suddenly cautious , he stubs his cigarette- <p> # LINCOLN # I 'm going to check on my friend . <p> 98 INT . FRONT ROOM - THE SHACK - DUSK <p> A front room turned into a front office . Piles of paper teeter atop junk furniture . A bankers lap we might recognize from our own era glows over a desk where Ozzie is rummaging , looking for something . He stops to peer through and check on his visitors- <p> The woman still lies asleep on the sofa . The man is sitting beside her armchair , head bowed , seemingly plunged in thought . <p> Ozzie resumes rummaging to find a crumpled delivery note . He reviews it for a moment . Then quickly clears away some more papers to uncover a keypad device . It is known as a " holocom " . He taps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digits from the delivery note . The holoframe snows with static . Then a crosshatch insignia appears , spinning in 3D : <p> RECORDED VOICE ( ON HOLOCOM ) Welcome to The Sanger Institute . If you know your party 's extension , press ... <p> LINCOLN ( O.S. ) What are you doing ? <p> Ozzie jerks round to find his visitor suddenly standing there . He fumbles on the holocom keypad and the crosshatch blinks out . <p> # OZZIE # Nuthin . I was n't doin nuthin . <p> Lincoln frowns , the sense of danger becoming more distinct . Ozzie reads his visitor 's troubled expression , realizing- <p> # OZZIE # I knew it ... them clothes ... them weird tattoos ... I mean , I heard stories from those guys but I never ... <p> Off his visitor 's frown , Ozzie bites his tongue . He 's cornered in this cramped space with a freak of science . Time to backpedal- <p> # OZZIE # Not that I believe em ... buncha crazy stories ... nuthin to do with you ... <p> He chuckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pupils dilated and dark , somehow inhuman . Time to wriggle out- <p> # OZZIE # Whaddya say we just forget about it , huh ? How about I go getcha a beer ? <p> He makes a move past but his visitor does n't budge . Lincoln senses danger in this old man , whose fear is now manifest- <p> # OZZIE # Whatever you want ... Just take it ... Whaddya want ... ? You want money ... ? <p> His visitor frowns . Ozzie quickly unlocks a cashbox . He grabs some colored plastic cards and offers them like meat to a lion . <p> # OZZIE # It 's all I got ... Take it ... just please ... just do n't hurt me ... <p> His visitor takes a blue card , inspecting it like a curiosity . Then steps closer . Ozzie shrinks back . An ominous moment , then- <p> # LINCOLN # " Out of state " - how do I get there ? <p> Off Ozzie 's cowering and confused look , we - <p> CUT TO : <p> 99 EXT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows a seed of light . The whisper flies low and quiet , its spotlight roving the undulant desert . Now picking out metal glints as it banks over a scrapyard . Now training its beam on a figure in the dust whirl beneath . Ozzie , his hair flying wild , gesticulating madly . The whisper follows his directions , nosing onwards , its spotlight corrugating across the red rocks . <p> 100 EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - NIGHT <p> In the middle of nowhere , a canopied platform . Not unlike the sub-way platform , it borders a deeply trenched lodeway . A wave of dust rolls in , swelled by the whisper , landed beyond . It seems to bring Scheer to the platform . He scans around for a clue , a footprint perhaps . But somehow he already knows . He looks up the lodeway , eyes honing . The deep black line stretches far into the night . <p> 101 INT . THE GLASS VILLA - NIGHT <p> Silence . Still . Sanger sits nursing a cup of herb tea . Crowne sits smoking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The still is broken as Merrick emerges from an adjacent room . Sanger and Crowne look up , expectant . Merrick closes the door with slow care . Then he faces them , a grim tenor in his voice- <p> # MERRICK # Bad news . <p> 102 EXT . PHOENIX - NIGHT <p> The whisper slices the night , running lights blinking . We pan to frame it against a skyline of black towers . A glittering row of domes and spires , somehow celestial , touching the sky . The city bears no trace of its origins , once built over Indian ruins , now rebuilt , subsumed by urban overhaul . It has become a metropolis . <p> 103 INT . ROOFTOP NIGHTCLUB - PHOENIX <p> A glass dome , faceted , insectile . A haut-monde hive . The movers and shakers of the high-tech boomtown drinking , dancing . Shot waitresses dose blue tequila . Bass music thuds like a heartbeat . Scheer looks out of place here but the crowd 's too self-absorbed to care . He moves through them , invisibly , towards a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of blue tequila . The first is bald , pale and dead-looking , he 'd be the grim reaper but for his fixed leer . The second is long-haired , bearded , hulking , more of a grim ploughman . He has a metal brace screwed into his forearm . <p> # SCHEER # Which one of you is Diggs ? <p> DIGGS ( THE BALD MAN ) That 's me , slick . This here 's my partner Burdon . Do n't mind him . He gets a little shy around strangers . <p> # SCHEER # What happened to his arm ? <p> # DIGGS # Pursuit last week . The guy took a swing at him with a fireaxe . Did n't stop Burdie though . Took down that fucker with one arm , did n't you ? <p> Burdon sips his drink . Scheer , underwhelmed , takes a seat . <p> # SCHEER # You do n't look like bounty hunters . <p> # DIGGS # Well we 're on the job , see ? And it kind of helps if you bleed in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # SCHEER # I 'm just an intermediary . <p> # DIGGS # Now that 's what people use when they do n't want to get their hands dirty . <p> He grins , cannily . Scheer grimaces , a pro suffering an amateur . <p> # SCHEER # I was told you also handled civil bonds . Debt runners , data-thieves ... <p> # DIGGS # What we hunt depends on the bounty . <p> # SCHEER # It 's worth ten platinum . Unmarked . <p> Diggs pauses at this . A huge amount . Suspiciously huge . He licks some salt , downs a blue tequila shot and bites a slice of lime . <p> # DIGGS # What 's the bond ? <p> # SCHEER # The parties I represent want to limit the specific details . But let 's just say industrial secrets are involved . <p> # DIGGS # Ten platinum . Must be big secrets . <p> That canny grin again . It raises Scheer 's hackles- <p> # SCHEER # Any good at keeping them ? <p> # DIGGS # Oh , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have time to file every report and we got real bad memories . But just so we understand each other , slick , we 're talking about a bag job , right ? <p> Scheer returns an equivocal look . Then dips in his pocket for two digital slides - Lincoln and Ester 's headshots , spinning in 3D . <p> # DIGGS # What 's up with these tattoos ? They look like fucking boondock types . <p> # SCHEER # All I 'm authorized to tell you is they have no records in this state . Also that they 're not armed or dangerous . <p> # DIGGS # How about we start with their names ? <p> # SCHEER # John and Jane Doe ... <p> # DIGGS # You 're kidding me , right ? No names ? <p> Scheer 's look says he 's serious . But Diggs is still confounded . <p> # DIGGS # Then - with all due respect - how the fuck do you expect us to find them ? <p> # SCHEER # Because you wo n't have to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed for the terminal , trying to get out of state . It 's strictly a recovery job . For you , it should be childsplay . <p> # DIGGS # Then why not do it yourself ? Or is the dog ring just to impress the ladies ? <p> The grin . Scheer moves his hand to cover the USMC ring , stiffly- <p> # SCHEER # The parties I represent want to stay at arm 's length . And just so we understand each other that means no connection , no papertrail , no police interest ... <p> # DIGGS # Is that everything ? <p> # SCHEER # ... no mistakes . They want these two brought in quickly and quietly and unharmed . Once you have them , you 'll contact me for further instructions . <p> # DIGGS # I do n't know .

THE DESERT - MORNING <p> Sunlight blinks off a chain of carriages , travelling the trench of a lodeway . The overnight shuttle slits through the desert . <p> 105 INT . PASSENGER CAR - MORNING <p> The sun is a muted orb behind polarized glass . Lincoln stares out of the window at the bleak new world blurring past . He 's wearing Ozzie 's ballcap over his crosshatch , his former clothes discarded for some of the old man 's ill-fitting denims . Perhaps a disguise or perhaps just to shed the memory . He glances across at Ester , dressed likewise , her hair teased to cover her crosshatch . She 's dozing , head rested on the glass . A TICKET COLLECTOR comes up- <p> # TICKET COLLECTOR # Tickets ... <p> Lincoln looks at the man in uniform , uncertain what he wants . The ticket collector shakes his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CONT 'D ) Adult fare is forty five currency units . Do you have the money , sir ? <p> Lincoln assimilates . Money . The word is familiar . He pulls out the blue plastic card . The man in uniform looks encouraged . He gives him the card , watching him slot it into a handheld device , which briefly flashes , then the card is returned . Lincoln sees a strip at the top is now transparent , like a depleted reservoir . He assimilates . Not so different from the transactions in the world below . Then he notices Ester is awake and is looking at him . Her bright eyes , dim and troubled , somehow accusatory . <p> # LINCOLN # It 's going to be okay , Ester . <p> # ESTER # ( faint ) Is it ? <p> # LINCOLN # We just need to get out of state . <p> Ester , disconsolate , looks out of the window . In her gaze , the forlorn air of a hatchling fallen from the nest . Lincoln watches her , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 106 EXT . PHOENIX - DAY <p> The skyline stands reprised in daylight . A glimmering citadel . <p> 107 EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - PHOENIX - DAY <p> Passengers climb the steps from an underground gloom . Lincoln and Ester with them , jostled by the more certain flow . They cross the portal onto the street and stop , dazzled by the sunlight . Only to be dazzled again by the sudden , stunning prospect of the city ... <p> First there 's the quality of light , a burning white , perhaps from depleted ozone , depicting everything in a surreal shimmer . Then there 's the towers , darkly crystalline , facets of polarized glass rising to domes and spires , like monolothic fingers reaching for the sky . The traffic flashing past , the chassis identifiable as trucks , taxis , compacts , sedans , streamlined in a nautical trim , hull runners in place of wheels . The sound of claxons , more like fog horns than car horns . Then there 's the street itself , a six-lane lodeway , lanes marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful arcs of pedestrian bridges at the intersections . The citizens , strange hairstyles , fashions , all wearing sunglasses . Even to us it 's a wondrous sight . The urbanism , the grandeur , as if here in the heart of southwest , Manhattan has met Venice . <p> VOICE ( O.S. ) Hey , man , spare a little green ? <p> Awe interrupted , Lincoln and Ester look around . Slouched by the street exit is A HOBO with a mangy dog . He grins toothlessly- <p> # THE HOBO # Ai n't eaten in two days , have we , boy ? <p> Lincoln and Ester step back as the dog rises to greet them . Tail wagging , it noses forward , sniffing . Then , abruptly , drops its tail and backs off , whining . Lincoln and Ester likewise back off . Both sides have just discovered a new species . The hobo pets his whining canine , watching the strangers walk off with curiosity . <p> 108 EXT . STREET - DAY <p> The sunlight flares off passing vehicles , hypnotic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander in thrall up the street . Everywhere new sights , new curiosities bombard them ... <p> The storefronts , mysterious recesses behind polarized glass . The glass , alive with pixellated graphics , marquees : " Temps ! Temps ! New Tech Opportunities ! " - " Beauty Therapy ! Manicures , Dermals , Follicle Grafts ! " - " Discount Legal Service ! Class Actions Only ! " <p> Holoframe billboards loom over the street , huge shimmering panels like phantom jumbotrons , commercials playing on a loop : <p>  --  A businessman in a conference room , shrinking from a fierce negotiation ; the scene replayed with the same businessman , now on his feet , stabbing his finger angrily in the air ; a pill bottle in CU , a text super " Combatrine ! The Aggression Enhancer " <p>  --  A teenager bemused by his homework : his parents escorting him into a clinic ; the teenager hooded by an electronic dome ; his parents clapping ; the teenager smiling as he accepts a diploma ; a text super " Intellex : Data Impression For A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ester is gone from his side . He scans the sea of faces . Then spots her stepping through a doorway . Over the threshold is a holoform : a pig with wings , circled by the legend " Hog Heaven ! Home Of The True Hamburger " . <p> 109 INT . HOG HEAVEN - DAY <p> Fast food outlets have evidently changed little . Promotional posters in 3D : " Ham Slam " , " Porker Forkers " , " Bacon Blitz " . <p> Service counter , seating area . Ester is looking around like Alice In Wonderland . Lincoln comes up , out of breath , edgy- <p> # LINCOLN # I told you to stay with me . <p> # ESTER # ( innocent , plaintive ) I 'm hungry . <p> # LINCOLN # Okay . Okay ... <p> He nods , realizing he is too . He plants Ester in a seat and looks around . People stand in line transacting , receiving food trays . Not unlike nutrition plaza . Lincoln ventures to the counter . He offers the blue card hopefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you gon na tell me what you want ? <p> # LINCOLN # ( beat , no other reference ) What are my options ? <p> THE SERVICE CLERK Knock yourself out , buddy . <p> He indicates a menu above . Lincoln assimilates , looking up at the menu . Understanding now , his face lifts to almost a smile . It 's the first time he 's been given an unrestricted choice . <p> 110 INT . SEATING AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER <p> Lincoln returns to Ester with a tray of food and drink . She 's staring off again , distant . He puts a burger and drink cup in front of her . She seems not to notice . He tries to engage her- <p> # LINCOLN # I asked the man how to get to the terminal . He said it 's not far . <p> But Ester just keeps staring , her brow now furrowing as A LITTLE GIRL skips past , maybe 11 , sipping a soda . Now Lincoln sees her too and is transfixed . Now the little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onward , uncomfortable . Lincoln and Ester 's eyes follow . It 's the first time they 've seen a child . <p> 111 EXT . PHOENIX TERMINAL - DAY <p> A low rumble . A plume of smoke . A sudden eruption of fire . A bird rises from the flames and a phoenix spreads its wings . Widening , we reveal this is a holoform over the terminal entrance . <p> Union Station now looks more like Grand Central . A huge granite facade , a covered colonnade linking to pedestrian bridges at the corners . Here , in the flow of figures , we make out Lincoln and Ester , resembling tourists . Then , a short distance behind , we spot two more figures . The hobo and his timorous dog . Following . <p> 112 INT . CONCOURSE - TERMINAL - DAY <p> Vaulted . Arched windows , mosaiced in polarized glass . Sunlight falls in filtered shafts . Footfalls echo off polished granite . Lincoln and Ester scan around . Ester looks daunted by the space . Lincoln looks focused . He sees people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - DAY <p> The sign on the window reads " Tickets " . Lincoln assimilates . The word is familiar . He steps up to the counter with Ester . A TICKET CLERK - female , immaculately groomed - greets them with a glossy smile . Lincoln offers her the blue card . She seems not to notice . <p> THE TICKET CLERK Welcome to Phoenix Union Station . What is your date of travel , sir ? <p> Lincoln has to think . Dates mean nothing to him . He ventures- <p> # LINCOLN # Now ... <p> THE TICKET CLERK And what is your destination ? <p> # LINCOLN # Out of state . <p> THE TICKET CLERK I 'm sorry . Could you repeat that ? <p> # LINCOLN # We want to go out of state . <p> THE TICKET CLERK I 'm sorry . Could you repeat that ? <p> VOICE ( O.S. ) Like talking to a wall , ai n't it ? <p> Lincoln and Ester turn to look . The interceder is pale , bald , wearing leathers . A stranger to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holoserve . Cheaper than flesh and blood but nothing between the ears . <p> Diggs demonstrates , wafting his hand across the ticket counter . It cuts through the ticket clerk with a holographic ripple . <p> # DIGGS # First time I used one of these , I asked her out on a date ... <p> He grins genially , examining their faces , verifying his quarry . Lincoln examines the pale man . The sense of danger is welling- <p> # LINCOLN # What do you want ? <p> # DIGGS # Just wanted to help , that 's all . <p> Diggs shrugs , disarming , trying to win them over , nice and easy per the mandate . Then he notices the eyes of his male quarry . The pupils , black and dilating . Suddenly the male jerks away , like a shying horse , drawing the female with him . Diggs , unperturbed , makes no attempt to follow . Turning his back on them , he touches a device concealed in his ear canal , a miniature two-way radio- <p> DIGGS ( INTO RADIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 114 EXT . TERMINAL - DAY <p> Lincoln and Ester emerge into the colonnade , rejoining the flow of figures . Lincoln presses the pace , alert , darting looks back . The pale man does n't appear to be following . But the sense of danger is spurring him to gain distance . Ester , vicarious to the danger , stays close to Lincoln 's side , scurrying to keep up . Neither of them notices the grey vehicle sliding up on them , kerbside . A commercial transit van known as a " cutter " , it 's a common sight on the streets . The driver leans out of the window - hair tied back , dressed in buckskins , we recognize BURDON- <p> # BURDON # You folks need a ride ? <p> Lincoln and Ester turn to look . The dark giant is just another stranger , cast in a demeanor of casual inquiry . He 's offering an opportunity to gain distance but Lincoln remains hesitant . The sense of danger , turbulent , hard to read . Burdon sugars the way- <p> # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He taps a button and the side-door slips open . Lincoln looks into the lightless cavity , wavering , uncertain . Ester , hugging close , nervous . Figures passing , jostling them toward the cavity . The dark giant , looking on expectantly . The pause stretching , then- <p> VOICE ( O.S. ) Hey ! What the fuck are you doing , man ? <p> Back down the colonnade , THE HOBO is gesticulating to Burdon- <p> # THE HOBO # I told you ! They went inside ! <p> The hobo does n't see Lincoln and Ester , unwitting that he 's just betrayed himself as their shadow ... and Burdon as their predator . His dog starts barking . Lincoln starts backing away with Ester , his eyes blackening , the danger surging , the dog barking , the giant 's face dropping , the elements converging ... They bolt . <p> # BURDON # Shit ! <p> BURDON JAMS INTO REVERSE - but his pursuit is cut short by a parked vehicle - he swings a look back , jabbing his earpiece- <p> BURDON ( INTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND ESTER RACE UP THE COLONNADE - against the flow of figures - darting and weaving like fish swimming upstream  --  <p> DIGGS BURSTS FROM THE NORTH EXIT - launching up the north side of the terminal - thinner foot traffic here , faster going  --  <p> LINCOLN AND ESTER SLOWING - the flow massing under the portico - they peel through - the holoform phoenix rumbling overhead  --  <p> DIGGS TURNING THE NORTH CORNER - pausing to touch his earpiece - now launching south down the colonnade - towards the portico - jerking a pair of handcuffs from his belt , ready for the snatch  --  <p> LINCOLN AND ESTER GAINING PACE - past the portico now , the way opening - Lincoln 's eyes flaring - a face in the distance ahead - the pale man - he swings Ester around - doubling back to find  --  <p> BURDON COMING UP BEHIND - the flow of figures , no obstacle - parting at his thunderous onset - his quarry , stopped and staring at him - almost upon them - handcuffs at the ready  --  <p> LINCOLN FREEZES - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ester cringing to his side - the dark giant charging up on them - sunlight on metal - the sight of the handcuffs - TRIGGERING HIM  --  <p> LINCOLN GRABS ESTER - swinging her off the sidewalk - lowering her into the lodeway - leaping down to join her - lode poles pulsing , thrumming - rivets on their denims , rattling from the polarity - traffic soaring past on lode-stream , chest-high - <p> DARTING OUT INTO TRAFFIC - Lincoln leads Ester by the hand like a child - across the lanes , dodging , weaving through the gaps - claxons blaring , deafening - sunflashes , blinding - a sudden shadow - a huge freight truck bearing down , no gaps ahead  --  <p> LINCOLN DRAGS ESTER TO THE GROUND - both flattening against the concrete lode-bed - the shadow engulfing them - the truck 's hull runners shearing narrowly over their heads - the rush of air , sweeping off Lincoln 's ballcap - rousing a storm of dust  --  <p> LINCOLN AND ESTER CHOKING - crawling onward through the dust - hull runners scudding overhead - maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like cheesewire - onwards , crawling across the concrete - fighting their way across the lode-stream  --  <p> BURDON WATCHING from the sidewalk where Lincoln and Ester first dropped , scouring the trench for a sight of them . Now he spots them , climbing up onto the sidewalk the far side of the street . <p> Diggs now arrives at his side , sweating , out of breath . Now seeing their quarry take off up the far side of the street , he turns to his lumberous partnet , fury mixed with incredulity- <p> # DIGGS # Why the fuck did n't you go after them ? ! <p> Burdon just looks at him , displaying the metal brace on his fore-arm . Diggs , out of sheer frustration , gives him a pounding shove- <p> # DIGGS # Fuck ! <p> 115 EXT . ALLEY - DAY <p> The refuge of shadow . The alley is divided by a lodeway and the walls on each side are jutted with dumpsters . Lincoln and Ester run up the narrowed strip of sidewalk , forced into single file . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " scow " . Like a leviathan spreading its tentacles , the scow 's tube-arrays dock with the dumpsters and start sucking the contents out . <p> Lincoln glances back to find Ester has stopped and is cringing away from the tentacled monster . He returns to her , his eyes flicking around , aware that their real predators are close- <p> # LINCOLN # We have to keep going . <p> He takes Ester 's hand , drawing her onward . But Ester recoils , shaking off his grip . Now he looks at her more closely . She 's panting , shuddering , fraught with trauma . Her voice is haunted- <p> # ESTER # Please ... Please , I want to go back ... <p> She shrinks into the shadows , shaking her head . The hatchling wanting to return to the nest . Lincoln meets her eye , deeply- <p> # LINCOLN # Those men - that 's what they want too . <p> Ester holds his gaze , chest heaving . Then looks back towards the alley mouth . Her fingers reach for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assimilating , reason reasserting its heavy grip . Lincoln senses her turmoil . His voice is soft but sturdy- <p> # LINCOLN # We have to keep going , Ester . <p> Ester looks up at him again . The forlorn air seems to have faded . Her eyes , grimly set . Her face , a little haggard . Older somehow . She takes Lincoln 's hand and together they head off up the alley . <p> 116 EXT . ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER <p> The alley mouth darkens as a vehicle turns off the street . The grey cutter moves through the shadows , prowling and shark-like . <p> 117 INT . CUTTER - DRIVING <p> The drone of resistors . The throbbing glow of the drive console , a panoply of instrumentation . Burdon steers in silence , Diggs beside him , edgy , intent , combing the shadows for their quarry . <p> # DIGGS # Sunnavabitch ! What the fuck do we do now , huh ? They could be anywhere ... <p> # BURDON # We go back to the office and run em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane Doe ? <p> # BURDON # We ask the guy . <p> # DIGGS # Yeah , let 's tell him we could n't hack it in kindergarten .

Burdon absorbs this , unflinched , thinking- <p> # BURDON # It was blue , right ? <p> # DIGGS # What ? <p> # BURDON # They were using a blue currency card . <p> 118 EXT . STREET - DAY <p> Lincoln and Ester walk up the street . Wary of attention , they go with the flow of figures , eyes peeled for predators . The sights of the city now seem hostile . Faces flash past , dead-eyed in sun-glasses . Traffic rushes like steel rapids . Storefronts construct a black wall . Holoframe billboards loom , mocking , half-noticed : <p>  --  A woman in a bathroom , adjusting her sexy neglige ; a crack in the door shows a man in bed , waiting ; the woman closes the door and picks up what looks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feminine Impulse Gel ... Because who needs him ? " <p>  --  A cemetery under a grim overcast sky ; suddenly a frisbee flies across frame ; an old woman , dressed like a teenager , catches it ; she tosses it to an old man dressed likewise ; a text super " Death Sucks ! " , a sting , " New Gaza Healthcare : Your Life Is Our Life . " <p> Lincoln and Ester stop at the corner . They look around , blindly , no coordinates , no frame of reference . Urban canyons , identical , gordian and chasmic . Passing figures jostle . Then Lincoln spots something across the street . It looks like an over-sized phone booth . Its beacon flashes ; " C.I.N. - CITY INFORMATION NETWORK . " <p> 119 INT . CIN BOOTH - DAY <p> A flourish of music greets Lincoln and Ester as they enter . The fanfare conjures a holoform in mid-air . A cartoon rattlesnake , benignly rendered , welcomes them with a clownish , fanged smile : <p> # THE SNAKE # Hi there ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to go , I got the answers ! Let 's look at the menu ! <p> A set of text frames appear : " Residential Listings " , " Business Listings " , " Transport Listings " , " Hotel Listings " . Lincoln assimilates .

Let me open that directory for you ! I 'll be with you in two shakes ! <p> The snake rattles accordingly and coils in a holding pattern . Then a tomographic map of the city appears . A red dot plants itself under a text flag " You Are Here ! " . Then other red dots scatter across the map , each flagging with transportation icons . <p> 120 INT . CUTTER - STREETS - DRIVING - DAY <p> Burdon steers calmly , scanning the streets . Diggs impatiently bashes the keys of a holocom on the drive console . A holoframe hovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears - sagging , older , primped and painted young . Her name is JANEEN- <p> JANEEN ( ON HOLOCOM ) Diggs &; Burdon Bond Agency . <p> # DIGGS # Janeen , where the fuck have you been ? <p> JANEEN ( ON HOLOCOM ) Beauty therapy . I got a date tonight . <p> # DIGGS # Oh , Jesus ... Listen , I want you to punch into the currency stream for me .

You have any idea how long that 's going to take ? <p> # DIGGS # I want serial numbers , batched and cross-referenced . Start from Union Station and work your way out ... <p> Before he can object he taps a key . The holoframe blinks out . <p> 121 EXT . BUS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON <p> A surging sound . A surface of water . A burst of spray . A dolphin leaps from the waves and hangs suspended . Text scrolls around : " Get Out Of State &; Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the next incarnation of the greyhound . The blue facade , crested into waves . We make out Lincoln and Ester , now looking more like transients than tourists , dirty , worn and exhausted . <p> 122 INT . CONCOURSE - BUS STATION <p> Low roof . Flat lighting . The faces here seem less threatening , the young and the low-income . Lincoln and Ester look around . Not unlike the train terminal . People standing in line , transacting . <p> 123 INT . TICKET WINDOW <p> Lincoln and Ester step up to the ticket window . A TICKET CLERK - male , immaculately groomed - greets them with a polished smile . <p> # TICKET CLERK # Welcome to Grey Dolphin Bus Lines . What is your destination , please ? <p> Lincoln squints at him . Then wafts his hand across the counter . The ticket clerk flinches at the impact . Then composes himself . A trace of camp as he smiles bashfully at the rugged customer- <p> # TICKET CLERK # It 's okay . Really . I get that a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> # LINCOLN # I want to get out of state .

It 's perfect this time of year . <p> Lincoln nods , liking the sound of this . The ticket clerk smiles , enjoying the acceptance of his suggestion , he ventures hopefully- <p> # TICKET CLERK # Travelling alone , are we ? <p> # LINCOLN # No . With her . <p> He gestures , then realizes Ester is gone from his side again . <p> He scans the faces . The clerk , disappointed , taps some keys . <p> # TICKET COLLECTOR # Two adults , let me see ... I 'm afraid I ca n't get you seats till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUS STATION <p> A grill bar . A rank of vending machines . Ester moves through the seating area as if drawn . Now over the ambient noise , we isolate the cry of a baby . Ester is following the sound to its source . She finds a Mexican woman shushing her infant . The woman looks up and smiles . Ester just stands there , awe-struck . Lincoln now comes up to reclaim her . He 's about to ask why she wandered off when she turns to him . He sees her eyes are brimming with tears . Tears of joy and sorrow . It 's the first time she 's seen a baby . <p> 125 EXT . STREET - DUSK <p> The winged pig flutters over the doors of " Hog Heaven " . The milling customers are suddenly parted by Diggs , bursting out through the doors . He leaps into the grey cutter , parked kerbside . It peels out with a flash of its halogen eyes . <p> 126 INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - DUSK <p> Burdon steers , glancing inquisitively at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galvanized . The holoframe resolves snowed with static . Janeen 's face appears .

Start with the last hour and work back . <p> # JANEEN # Great . So I got to park my ass in front of a screen all night ? <p> # DIGGS # It 's a platinum bond , Janeen . We get this , I 'll buy you a new ass , okay ? <p> He grins at Burdon . The thrill of the chase glows in his eyes . <p> 127 INT . WAITING AREA - BUS STATION - NIGHT <p> A blue glass partition wall looks out onto the depot . More like a marina with an embarcadero and a row of docks . " Liners " slot in and out , their nautical trim making them seem like ferries . <p> Lincoln and Ester sit waiting . Lincoln , rigid , watchful . Ester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant cradled asleep . Ester glances wistfully at Lincoln . Then she frowns- <p> # ESTER # Lincoln , what is that ? On your face ? <p> Lincoln turns , touching his face . He feels stubble there . For the first time . His body is naturalizing but it feels unnatural to him . Ester reaches out and runs her fingers across his cheek . Lincoln stiffens a little , unused to this type of contact . But her touch is gentle and the contact is warming . Their eyes slowly meet , flickering , something passing between them . Then Ester 's face contorts slightly . She emits a shallow cough . <p> # LINCOLN # Are you alright ? <p> Ester clears her throat . But another cough follows . <p> # ESTER # My throat ... it feels dry ... <p> # LINCOLN # Okay ... I 'll get you some water . <p> 128 INT . FOOD SERVICE AREA - NIGHT <p> Empty . The grill bar is closed . Only the vending machines are active . Lincoln considers them . Not unlike those he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles . The sign reads " Arctic Melt " . He pulls out his blue card and looks for the slot . Then pauses , picking up his reflection in the glass . He examines the shadowy growth on his face . Then he notices his eyes . They seem to be darkening . The pupils , welling open . Then he feels it . The sense of danger , surging up like a geyser . <p> 129 INT . DEPARTURE AREA <p> Ester sits waiting , anxious now , coughing persistently . Hearing footfalls , she looks round . But the face that greets her is not Lincoln . It 's the pale man , the one who chased them . Before she can react , he forcefully pulls her upright , tapping his earpiece- <p> DIGGS ( ON RADIO ) Piece of cake , Burdie . Jane Doe 's in the bag . Keep an eye out for John-Boy . <p> Ester looks around in panic . Faces turn but none of them are Lincoln 's . Diggs confronts the spectators , flashing a badge - <p> # DIGGS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his female quarry towards the exit .

BACKSTREET - NIGHT <p> SIRENS WAILING IN THE DISTANCE . Lincoln and Ester race down the sidewalk , along a construction hoarding . Ester slows , doubling over , rasping . Lincoln looks at her , her lips , blue , her face , pale . The sirens , getting louder . He sees a gap in the hoarding- <p> 135 EXT . ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT <p> Lincoln and Ester emerge through the gap onto a derelict tract . A once public park , now a construction site . Mounds and craters of earth . Dim shapes of huge vehicles , like sleeping dragons . Patches of parkland , as yet untouched . Bowed palms , dead grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascendant moon . On its shoreline is a dilapidated construct that was once a boathouse . <p> 136 INT . BOATHOUSE - ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT <p> The refuge of shadow . The collapsed roof allowing streams and puddles of moonlight . Lincoln helps Ester onto a rotted bench . She slumps down , exhausted , Lincoln watches her , helplessly . She 's fighting for breath , wheezing and coughing in deep rasps . <p> # ESTER # I ca n't ... I ca n't breathe ... my throat ... it 's so ... dry ... <p> # LINCOLN # I 'll find you some water . <p> He looks around blindly . Some junk in the corner . He rummages , finds a rusted metal box . Pries it open , empties the contents . Gauzes , band-aids - evidently a first-aid box - then a bottle . He opens it , sniffs . It smells pungent . Alcohol , not water . Ester suddenly starts sobbing . Lincoln returns to her side- <p> # LINCOLN # It 's going to be okay , Ester . <p> # ESTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # LINCOLN # I 'll find you some water , okay ? <p> Ester looks up at him , wheezing , tears streaming from her eyes- <p> # ESTER # And then what , Lincoln ? <p> # LINCOLN # I 'll find another way . Out of state . <p> # ESTER # And then what ? What if they find us ? <p> # LINCOLN # Then we 'll keep going . <p> # ESTER # I ca n't ... I ca n't run anymore ... <p> Ester folds over , sobbing and coughing at the same time . Pitiful to watch . Lincoln crouches , gaining her eyeline , very deliberate- <p> # LINCOLN # We 'll keep going till we get there . <p> Ester traps a sob , reading his eyes , something reviving in her- <p> # ESTER # The Island ... You mean , The Island ? <p> Lincoln answers with a brief smile . If this will keep her going then the truth is redundant . He eases her out of the moment- <p> # LINCOLN # Now I 'm going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 'll be safer . <p> Ester wipes away her tears , sniffing . Her breaths , calming . <p> # ESTER # Do n't go yet . Stay with me , Lincoln . Stay with me for a little while . <p> Lincoln looks puzzled by Ester 's request . Even more puzzled as she rests her head on his shoulder , nestling into his neck . He feels her against him . The warmth spreading through him again . His arm reaching , as if of its own accord , closing around her . It feels right somehow . And there he stays , holding her , looking out across the dereliction . And the moon rises over Encanto Park . <p> 137 EXT . METRO PD STATION - NIGHT <p> The holoform logo of The Metro PD glows over the threshold . Diggs exits with a dark glower . The cutter is waiting kerbside . <p> 138 INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - NIGHT <p> Diggs climbs in an Burdon steers out into traffic . The thrill of the chase is gone from them now . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A holoframe resolves , snows with static . Then Janeen 's face appears , dishevelled , bitter- <p> JANEEN ( ON HOLOCOM ) What the fuck do you want now ? <p> # DIGGS # ( very calm , very cold ) Punch into the currency stream , close the net on downtown and keep the search active . The next time they use the card , I want to be right on top of them ... <p> Off his icy tone , Janeen nods without retort . Diggs hits a key and her face blinks out . And the cutter prowls into the night . <p> 139 EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT <p> The winged pig flutters over the doors of " Hog Heaven " . Another franchise on a more downtrodden street . Lincoln emerges with a bag of food and drink . He considers the blue card . The reservoir , now close to the bottom , his resources almost exhausted . With a look of foreboding , he pockets the card and turns the corner . And suddenly stops in his tracks . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predator . His eyes are fixed on a holoframe billboard : <p>  --  A football player in montage ; pummeling into a defensive line ; running for a touchdown ; gyrating in the endzone ; spinning in an NFL podium shot , super ; " Nobody Stops The Juggernaut ! " ; a team logo , super ; " Come See The Phoenix Admirals ! Rulers of the AFC ! " <p> Lincoln recognizes the player 's face but it 's not possible . He waits for the loop to restart . There it is again . The face of Starkweather Two-Delta . Incredulous , he stops a pedestrian- <p> # LINCOLN # The man , the man up there . Who is he ? <p> # PEDESTRIAN # What planet you been living on ? That 's the Juggernaut , brother . <p> # LINCOLN # The juggernaut ... <p> # PEDESTRIAN # Jamil " The Juggernaut " Starkweather - highest rushing total in the league . Least till that injury blew out his gut . Now the doctors are saying he 'll be back on his feet next season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lincoln does n't respond . The pedestrian shrugs and heads on , writing him off . Lincoln lingers , staring up at the billboard . <p> 140 INT . CIN BOOTH - NIGHT <p> The flourish of music greets Lincoln as he enters . The cartoon rattlesnake appears and smiles his clownish , fanged smile : <p> # THE SNAKE # Hi there ! I 'm Tattletail ! Whatever you want to know , wherever you want to go , I got the answers ! Let 's look at the menu ! <p> The set of text frames appears : " Residential Listings " , " Business Listings " , " Transport Listings " , " Hotel Listings " . <p> # THE SNAKE # Now let 's make a selection ! <p> A heavy pause . Lincoln 's voice comes with a slight tremor . <p> # LINCOLN # Residential ... <p> # THE SNAKE # Please give me the name . <p> # LINCOLN # Starkweather ... <p> # THE SNAKE # Okay ! Let me find that listing for you ! I 'll be with you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then a headshot appears with the face of Jamil Starkweather , scaled across with a red line . <p> # THE SNAKE # Starkweather , Jamil ... I 'm sorry ! This listing is blocked from the directory ! <p> Lincoln stands , darkly intent on the face . Now irrefutably the same face he saw in his life below . The snake shakes its rattle- <p> # THE SNAKE # You want me to find another listing ? <p> Lincoln looks at the snake , flicking its tongue , coiling . <p> FADE TO BLACK . <p> 141 EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - MORNING <p> A downtrodden neighborhood . The buildings look like remnants from our own era . A scruffy man slouches up to a gated storefront . He slots a key into a lock panel and the gate rolls up , squealing . We widen to a vehicle parked kerbside . A familiar grey cutter . <p> 142 INT . STORE - MORNING <p> Lights flicker on to disclose a gunshop . The array of firearms as fathomless as their purpose . The scruffy gunshop owner slouches inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawns at them- <p> # GUNSHOP OWNER # We ai n't open for another hour . <p> # DIGGS # Yeah , well we ai n't in the market . <p> # GUNSHOP OWNER # Everyone 's in the market , pal . One end of the barrel or the other ... <p> # DIGGS # We 're chasing up a currency record from last night . These two ring a bell ? <p> Diggs displays two digital slides . The owner pauses , suspicious . <p> # GUNSHOP OWNER # What are you ? Cops ? Lawyers ? <p> Diggs answers by jerking out the rainmaker . The twin barrels aimed at his head , the gunshop owner loses his cool a little- <p> # GUNSHOP OWNER # Him , I remember ... Came in just before closing ... wanted a shooter but did n't have no ID ... settled for one of these . <p> He displays a HUNTING KNIFE , unsheathing it , showing the blade . <p> # DIGGS # Did he give you a name ? <p> # GUNSHOP OWNER # No . <p> # DIGGS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # GUNSHOP OWNER # No . <p> Diggs cocks the hammer . The owner flinches . Then , off the knife- <p> # GUNSHOP OWNER # There was one thing . Kinda weird . He wanted to know how to use it ... <p> 143 EXT . APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING <p> An apartment building towers overhead , vaguely ominous . Lincoln approaches the entrance with Ester . We now see he has a band-aid covering his crosshatch . He takes Ester briefly aside , teasing some tresses over hers . As she gently smooths down her hair , Ester catches his eye . A look flickers between them . Then- <p> DOORMAN ( O.S. ) Fancy dress , was it , sir ? <p> A DOORMAN is looking at them like they just rolled out of a club he would n't be seen dead in . Off their flustered looks , he gives an apologetic smile . Then opens the door and holds it for them . Lincoln reaches for Ester 's hand . Then stiffly leads her inside . <p> 144 INT . CORRIDOR - AN UPPER FLOOR - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at peephole level . Like eyeballs , watching , as Lincoln and Ester proceed up the corridor . They stop at a door . Lincoln checks the number . Pauses heavily . Then looks for some type of doorbell . As his eyes cross the orb , it seems to blink . Then comes a sound of disengaging locks . Then the door swings open . Lincoln flinches , taken by surprise . Then frowns as he sees there is no one on the other side of the door . <p> 145 INT . APARTMENT - DAY <p> Lincoln enters , wary , scanning around . A living room . Framed pictures . A sofa , chairs . A coffee table , empty bottles , cigarette packs , a full ashtray . A bureau , some paperwork . Silence , stillness . No sign of life , no sense of danger . Lincoln moves across to the bureau and starts leafing through the papers . Ester ventures in through the door , curious- <p> # ESTER # What are you looking for ? <p> # LINCOLN # I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming . <p> As he leafs the papers , Ester waits dutifully by the door . Her eyes wander across the framed pictures . Then narrow onto a 3D photograph . A college boxing team photo , grinning cup winners . <p> # ESTER # Look at this ... <p> Lincoln returns to her . Ester points to the photo . A face in the row , blurred but eerily familiar . Lincoln seems not to react . Ester , curiosity piqued , scans the other pictures . She alights on a framed certificate - " Thomas R. Lincoln , Attorney-at-Law " . <p> A MAN 'S VOICE ( O.S. ) What the hell are you doing ? <p> Lincoln turns to confront A MAN in a robe . Disheveled from sleep , grey from a hangover ... the man 's face is unmistakably his own . This is TOM LINCOLN , sponsor of Lincoln Six-Echo , his bleary eyes now widening in disbelief as he recognizes his agnate- <p> # TOM # Oh , Jesus ... <p> Lincoln is better prepared for this encounter but still stunned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agnate stand frozen . The only movement is Ester , her eyes flicking between the same men , fraught , confused . Lincoln breaks the silence- <p> # LINCOLN # Who are you ? <p> Lincoln steps closer , eyes piercing . Tom takes a step back . <p> # TOM # They said ... I 'd never have to see you . <p> # LINCOLN # Who ? <p> Lincoln takes another step closer . Tom takes another step back . <p> # TOM # The people ... <p> # LINCOLN # What people ? <p> Lincoln takes another step closer . Tom stiffens , gathers himself- <p> # TOM # Look , if you do n't get out of here right now , I 'm calling security ... <p> Lincoln examines him , assimilating . His double seems to be as belligerent as he is . Reasoning now , threat response kicking in . Lincoln draws the hunting knife . Unused to it , he points it like a gun . But it 's enough of a threat for Tom , who swallows dryly- <p> # TOM # Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # LINCOLN # I want to know ... <p> Tom grimaces at the ambiguity . That face . His face . If not for the pounding headache this would be a bad dream . He lowers onto the sofa . Finds a cigarette and lights up . A drag , mind kicking in . The knife cautioning him . With a slow exhale , he confesses- <p> # TOM # One of the partners at my firm ... he told me about it . Gave me a referral . I thought he was joking at first . I went out there , took the sales tour . Even before that I knew it was n't a joke . There was this discretion agree-ment . I never saw anything like it and I 've seen a lot . Ironclad ... breathe a word and they 've got you by the balls . I do n't know ... There 's cancer in my family . Maybe it was just to keep up . All the partners were on the policy . <p> # LINCOLN # The policy ? <p> He looks at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # TOM # Christ , you have no idea , do you ? <p> # LINCOLN # About what ? <p> Tom drags his cigarette , fingers trembling . He shakes his head- <p> # TOM # I ca n't fucking do this ... <p> # LINCOLN # What are you talking about ? <p> Lincoln moves closer , pointing the knife . Tom flinches , then- <p> # TOM # Insurance . You 're an insurance policy . <p> # LINCOLN # What is that ? <p> # TOM # Health insurance ... medical ... <p> # LINCOLN # What does that mean ? <p> # TOM # If I get sick ... if part of me gets sick ... I take a healthy part from you . <p> # LINCOLN # Why ? <p> # TOM # How do you expect me to answer that ? It 's just how it works , that 's all . <p> Tom looks at his agnate . The insistent stare . The knife , pointing at him like a finger . His fear yields to a flicker of anger- <p> # TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # LINCOLN # Why do I look like you ? <p> # TOM # Because you are me ... <p> # LINCOLN # I do n't understand . <p> # TOM # Because they made you from my cells ... <p> # LINCOLN # Made me ? <p> # TOM # ( a flare of anger ) That 's right . You were made . Cooked up in a centrifuge like a fucking boiled egg . Every thought running through your head , every word coming out of your mouth , all of it , manufactured , made ... <p> Lincoln frowns , trying to assimilate . Too much to process . <p> # LINCOLN # You ... you 're the one who made me ? <p> # TOM # No . <p> # LINCOLN # Who made me ? <p> # TOM # I signed a contract . I can show you . <p> He gestures to a mirror on the wall . Lincoln steps back but his eyes are unremitting . Tom rises , cautious , crossing to the wall . He opens the mirror to reveal a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safe hisses open . He draws out a contract folder embossed with a crosshatch . Then offers it to his agnate- <p> # TOM # It 's all right there . Who , why ... <p> Lincoln takes the contract folder and starts flipping the pages , reading . A pendulous silence falls . Tom stands watching , smoking nervously . Ester stands by the door , trying to take all this in . <p> # TOM # Look you 've got what you wanted . Now why do n't you just get out of here ? <p> # LINCOLN # ( pause , looks at him ) There are men out there , looking for us . I want you to make them stop . <p> # TOM # I ca n't ... <p> Lincoln sets down the contract and brings up the knife again . <p> # TOM # I ca n't . Look , I 'm a lawyer , I know how it works . The contract , everything , it 's all laced with confidentiality clauses . It means they do n't want this to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to stop . You understand ? <p> Lincoln pauses , assimilating . His double 's expression indicates that he 's telling the truth . Maybe try a more practical request- <p> # LINCOLN # Do you have transport ? <p> # TOM # Transport , yes ... yes , parked downstairs ... Bay 53 ... Take it ... <p> # LINCOLN # And then you 'll call security ? <p> Lincoln steps closer , pointing the knife . Tom tries to stay dead-pan . The lawyer kicking in . Look them in the eye when you lie- <p> # TOM # I 'm not going to call security . I 'm not going to call anybody , okay ? <p> Lincoln looks at his double , reason now yielding to anger . Deep , roiling . Tom looks at his agnate , fear welling , deadpan cracking- <p> # TOM # Look , maybe there 's something ... maybe there 's a way to cancel the contract ... <p> Lincoln presses the tip of the blade to his double 's cheek . <p> # TOM # For Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches the blade deeper into the trembling face , drawing blood . The anger urging , hungry for more blood . Then suddenly- <p> # ESTER # Lincoln ! No ! <p> Lincoln looks at her , the anger interrupted , the knife still in place . He pauses . Then returns to his double . The dreading eyes , the trickle of blood down the face . His eyes . His face . A long , foreboding moment . Then suddenly Lincoln lashes out . His fist sends his double flying , falling in a flurry of contract pages . Lincoln stands over him , looking down , like a dominant species . His double is unmoving , unconscious . Lincoln abruptly spins away . <p> 146 INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING <p> The light panel flashes . Lincoln stands grimly , head lowered , trying to fathom the anger roiling within . Ester stares at him , wanly . Both held in the dark tableau . And the elevator descends . <p> 147 INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY <p> The vehicle parked in bay 53 is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " skiff " . Lincoln and Ester climb in . Lincoln reviews the drive console , the controls , all of it , meaningless . His eyes cross an orb set in the steering wheel . <p> The orb seems to blink and suddenly the drive console lights up . Lincoln reviews it . A screen in front of him is flashing : " PILOTING : MANUAL/AUTO ? " . He assimilates . Then ventures- <p> # LINCOLN # Auto ... <p> The interface processes , then asks : " DESTINATION : NAME/ADDRESS ? " <p> # LINCOLN # Out of state ... West ... <p> The interface processes , then reports " UNDOCKING " . Lincoln and Ester jolt as the skiff shunts forward . Lode-poles pulsing ahead of them , the skiff moves out , as if pulled by a phantom tugboat . <p> 148 EXT . STREET - DAY <p> The skiff buckets off the ramp into a street inlet . Then stops rocking a little . The interface reports : " ESTABLISHING UPLINK " . On another screen , a road map appears . A red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red line , plotting a course . <p> The autopilot scans for traffic , then nudges forward on the throttle . The resistors drone , the steering wheel turns and the skiff noses onto the street . Finding its lane , it drops to cruise speed . Lincoln studies the interplay of steering wheel , throttle and brake . Then glances at Ester . She 's plunged in thought , staring off . She turns to him with a haggard frown- <p> # ESTER # The man back there ... who looked like you ... does it mean I have someone too ? <p> Lincoln looks at her blankly , unknowing . Ester stares off again , her brow knotting with unanswered questions . But Lincoln 's gaze lingers . Her pale skin , her limpid eyes , her hair fluttering in the breeze . It 's the first time he 's really seen Ester 's beauty . <p> 149 EXT . PHOENIX SKYLINE - DAY <p> The domes and spires glint in the sunlight . We isolate a glass steeple . A crosshatch insignia . A legend " Sanger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY <p> A corner office with a panoramic view of the city . Crowne sits at a console desk , reviewing some data on a holoframe screen . A knock on the door and HER SECRETARY enters , looking unsettled- <p> # SECRETARY # I just thought I should warn you . I have a sponsor holding . His name 's Thomas Lincoln . He sounded ... angry . <p> 151 EXT . STREET TUNNEL - DAY <p> The skiff plunges into the shadow of an underpass . The interface flashes : " UPLINK INTERRUPT ... AUTOPILOT DISENGAGING " . Lincoln sits up , confused . The skiff is now slowing , drifting as if cut loose . He studies the controls again . Positions one hand on the steering wheel , the other on the throttle . Then he nudges it . <p> The skiff lurches , veering out of its lane . Another vehicle zips narrowly past , rocking them with its invisible backwash . Ester looks at Lincoln , suddenly alarmed . Lincoln tries again , firm on the wheel , gentle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 152 EXT . MOTEL - DOWNTOWN PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON <p> Dismal . The kind of place that precedes a life on the street . We push in on a window , cracked glass , the drapes closed within . <p> 153 INT . MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON <p> Gloomy , musty . A " holovision " plays some type of NFL recap . But Scheer is not watching it . He is lying on the bed , staring at the ceiling , motionless . Off a beeping sound , he stirs . He taps a holocom on the nightstand . A holoframe appears , resolving : <p> MERRICK ( ON HOLOCOM ) Karl , there 's been a complication . <p> 154 EXT . INTERSTATE - SUNSET <p> The sunset melts gold across the horizon as the skiff cruises westward . Eight lanes of lodeway rake through the salt flats . Lincoln is driving more confidently now . Ester is huddled asleep beside him . Suddenly the skiff starts to slow again . Lincoln reviews the controls . Throttle , forward , foot , off the brake . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiff is steering itself onto the hard shoulder . It now pulls to a dead halt . Ester is woken by the sudden inertia . She opens her eyes and looks around . They 've stopped in the middle of nowhere . <p> 155 EXT . THE SALT FLATS - SUNSET <p> The sun sinks in a slow pink haze . Lincoln and Ester walk across the salt flats . Visible in the distance is a walled settlement . <p> 156 EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET <p> An adobe wall culminates at an arched wooden gateway . Lincoln and Ester approach . They have n't walked far but Ester is already short of breath . As they near the gateway a holoserve appears , like a sentry - Native American , buckskins , feathered headdress and facepaint . His voice seems as old as the wind- <p> THE INDIAN HOLOGRAM Welcome to Salt River Heritage Park , home to the Hohokam Nation for over two thousand years . The park is now closed . Please come back during opening hours , 9am to 5pm , Monday through Saturday ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the holoserve seems angelic or ghostly . She 's examining his striped facepaint- <p> # ESTER # He has marks on his face like us . <p> She turns to Lincoln with a flowering smile . Then rushes up to the gateway , suddenly galvanized , squeezing through a gap . <p> 157 EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET <p> A ring of Native American pueblos . Pithouses and coursed adobes , recreations and preserved ruins . Ester rushes around the ring , looking into the pueblos as if expecting to find them inhabited . She ducks into one of the pithouses . Lincoln follows her inside . <p> 158 INT . PITHOUSE - SUNSET <p> The mud walls show a skeleton of saguaro ribs , cholla branches . It 's cosy in here , dim . The living area , recreated with mats and pottery . Lincoln finds Ester looking around , between excitement and confusion . She turns to him , her voice wavering , wheezing- <p> # ESTER # Is this ... is this place The Island ? <p> Lincoln answers with a softly negating look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her eyes . She lowers onto one of the mats and lies down , huddling . She looks up to him , wheezing- <p> # ESTER # I 'm tired . Let me rest for a while . <p> 159 EXT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT <p> Silence prevails but for the faint rattle of Ester 's breathing . Lincoln sits on low stool , in sentinel over her as she sleeps . In his eyes , we see the weight of foreboding . He does n't know what they 'll do when she wakes . Of a moaning sound he looks at Ester . Then realizes it is n't coming from her . The sound is far off , a rhythmic moaning . Now discernible as the chant of voices . <p> 160 EXT . THE PLATFORM MOUND - NIGHT <p> A blazing fire . Figures in silhouette , moving around , chanting . <p> The platform mound is situated just beyond the heritage park . An ancient ceremonial site , stepped in ruins , dusted with caliche . Pima and Maricopa , descendants of the Hohokam , are congregated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of horses are tethered , shuffling , snorting . Lincoln approaches , cautiously , but somehow like a moth to the flame . He stops at a distance , watching . The curiosity of congruent sound and movement . <p> VOICE ( O.S. ) You look a little lost , my friend . <p> Lincoln turns to a figure emerging from the night . A tall man - swarthy skin , mist-colored eyes . His tribal name is GREY DOVE- <p> GREY DOVE ( cont 'd ) Or did you come here for a reason ? <p> Lincoln examines the tall man . The face seems as deep and gentle as the voice . His sense of danger , unstirring , he concedes- <p> # LINCOLN # I was looking for water . <p> # GREY DOVE # Not the best place to look . <p> # LINCOLN # My transport ... it stopped working . <p> # GREY DOVE # I see . And where were you going ? <p> # LINCOLN # Out of state ... <p> Lincoln sighs , the destination seeming very far away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is somehow childlike . <p> 161 EXT . THE CEREMONY - LATER <p> The fire blazes across the face of a shaman . Old , gnarled , and dry as the salt flats . With a sacred mutter , he slips a peyote button onto his tongue . Then flings back his head , casting his eyes to the stars . When he lowers his head again , we see his pupils dilating . He rises , chanting , moving in ceremonial steps around the fire . Tribespeople sit in a ring , joining the chant . <p> Beyond the ring , others are dining at a roasting pit . Roast rabbit . Cornflour bread . The food is as it might been two thousand years ago . Only the sight of plastic water gallons breaks the illusion . Lincoln stands apart with Grey Dove , eating ravenously , gulping from a water gallon . He looks around- <p> # LINCOLN # What is this place ? <p> # GREY DOVE # It is a sacred place . My people come here to commune with their spirits . <p> Lincoln looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # GREY DOVE # Not easy to understand perhaps . For us , the spirit is like the shadow on the rock . Sometimes close , sometimes far away , sometimes the sky clouds and the shadow fades . We come here to ask our spirits to return to us . The man ... ( gestures to the shaman ) He speaks to The Grandfather from whom all spirits are born . The Great Spirit who binds every living thing . He has no name . But he is everywhere . In the sun and the moon , the wind and the rain ... <p> The shaman 's chanting grows louder , more insistent . His circuit around the fire becoming faster , building in religious fervor . <p> # GREY DOVE # Now he asks for the gift of vision that he may see through to the spirit shape of things . To find the spirits of the lost . To bring them into the light ... <p> The shaman 's chanting suddenly stops . He is looking directly at Lincoln , pointing . His face , contorting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dialect , ardently . Lincoln frowns in confusion . Grey Dove quietly draws him away from the mound . <p> 162 INT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER <p> Ester stirs from slumber . On the ground beside her , she finds a bowl of food and a water gallon . Now through the gloom , she sees Lincoln , sitting on the stool like he never left , keeping vigil . Something seems different about him as he turns , registering her- <p> # LINCOLN # Are you alright ? <p> # ESTER # I feel better after I sleep . <p> Lincoln nods absently and stares off out of the doorway . Ester moves closer , sensing something . He speaks as if from far away- <p> # LINCOLN # The man out there ... he said everything has a spirit ... every living thing ... but not ... <p> His voice cuts off . Ester looks at him , recognizing his pain . She does n't understand what it is or what caused it . It 's pain and it evokes a response in her . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strokes his hair . Lincoln looks up at her , questioning . With supreme knowing , Ester leans down and kisses him . At the touch of her lips , Lincoln pauses . The first kiss for both of them but Ester takes it in her stride . The calm ballet of nature . Fluidly peeling off her shirt , breasts steeping with moonlight . Lincoln rising to face her , feeling her proximity , her radiant heat . His fingers touching her breasts . Ester trembling , her lips once more finding his . Lincoln closing his eyes , the rush of sensation , overwhelming . He yields to it , returning the kiss , with hunger , with passion ... with spirit . <p> 163 EXT . THE INTERSTATE - DAWN <p> The sun rises in the east , depicting the traffic in silhouette . A vehicle arcs from the fast lane onto the hard shoulder where the skiff sits abandoned . The grey cutter pulls to a halt . <p> 164 EXT . HARD SHOULDER - DAWN <p> Diggs and Burdon move up on the skiff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver side , snapping aim with the thunderbolt . But the skiff is empty . The only sign of life is the interface , flashing red : " REMOTE LOCATOR TRANSMITTING " . <p> Burdon exchanges a look with Diggs . No dice . Diggs reaches in his pocket and pulls out what looks like an electronic telescope . He puts it to his eye and pans the salt flats . Burdon crouches at the roadside , looking for tracks . Then Diggs fixes on something- <p> # DIGGS # I got thermals . <p> 165 EXT . PLATFORM MOUND - SUNRISE <p> The fire is now reduced to a heap of embers . The tribespeople are asleep around the mound , wrapped in ethnic blankets . Diggs and Burdon move up stealthily , weapons at the ready . The horses bristle and snort , betraying their approach . The tribespeople , stirred by the noise , awake . Diggs and Burdon swing aim around the ring as faces rise and stare at them . None of the faces have white skin . Diggs lowers his weapon and addresses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond runners . They ditched near here last night . <p> DIGGS ( cont 'd ) One man , one woman . Tattoos on the forehead ... ( nothing , just silent stares ) Anyone 's seen them , I got fifty green . ( still nothing , aggravated ) What the fuck are you ? Deaf and dumb ? <p> The tribal faces just keep staring . Diggs scowls . Then suddenly swings aim with the rainmaker and fires . - BOOM-  hitting one of the horses in the haunch . It rears up , whinnying , setting off the rest of the horses . Diggs turns back to the gathering- <p> # DIGGS # Somebody start talking . <p> He scans around the ring . Then fixes on one of the women . She lifts a trembling finger to a man nearby . Grey Dove stiffens . <p> 166 EXT . SALT MOUNTAINS - SUNRISE <p> The sunrise depicts two silhouettes , moving across the ridge . Lincoln and Ester clamber over the calcified rocks . Ester now stops to catch her breath . She is wheezing again , fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she musters a brave smile- <p> # ESTER # I can make it . <p> 167 EXT . SALT CANYON - EARLY MORNING <p> A freight barge whooshes through the canyon , trailing a chain of low , arched containers , capacious in width rather than height . The conveyance is similar to a lodeway but wider , deeper , known as a " lode-canal " . At each end of the canyon , it intersects with other lode-canals , converging to use the same passage , a system of signals and lockgates controlling the flow of freight traffic . High above , on the south rim of the canyon , we find Lincoln and Ester . Ester is no longer wheezing but rasping . She looks down at the passing vessel , daunted . Lincoln offers her small comfort- <p> # LINCOLN # Do n't worry . The one we want goes the other way . He said it goes slower . <p> They exchange a smile . The chain of containers tailing off , the barge leaving the canyon with a blast of its resonant claxon . <p> 168 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ester descend the rocky slope toward the lode-canal . Ester stops , having to catch her breath every few steps . Lincoln tries to hide his concern , looking away towards the sunrise . The westbound vessel will be coming soon . <p> They just need to get out of state ... Now he frowns , sensing something . Faint but growing . His jaw clenches . His face tightens . His pupils start to dilate . <p> 169 EXT . THE NORTH RIDGE - MORNING <p> The north ridge is evidently threaded by a lodeway as we see the grey cutter pulling up . Diggs and Burdon get out and look down into the canyon . Diggs pulls out his scope and starts panning . Burdon peels off his jacket . It 's early but it 's already getting hot . Diggs now pauses , handing him the scope for his opinion- <p> # DIGGS # Up there in the rocks . Three o'clock . I 'm not sure ... it could be ambient . <p> 170 EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING <p> Lincoln and Ester hide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaths as best she can . Lincoln now hazards a look over the top . Two figures are climbing down the far side of the canyon , now pointing in their direction . He ducks back , assimilating . Hiding , no longer an option . Nor running , at least for Ester . His face sets in a grimace of conviction . His eyes glow darkly . <p> 171 EXT . THE NORTH FACE - MORNING <p> Diggs and Burdon reach the foot of the rocks . Neither speaks , communicating in hand-signals . Diggs slips into the lode-canal . Burdon covers , sweeping the thunderbolt across the south face . <p> Diggs emerges from the far side of the lode-canal . He stays low , moving up into the rocks . Then , from above , a rock dislodges , rattling down . Diggs reacts instantly , targeting , opening fire- <p> - BOOM- BOOM-  The shots from the rainmaker swathe across the rock . The thunderbolt now adding to the barrage , Burdon firing from the far side - SHOTS , BOLTS , KICKING UP A STORM OF DUST  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , reloading . No sign of movement . Just a slide of rubble . Fading echoes . <p> DIGGS STEALS ONWARDS UP THE ROCKS - into the fog of dust - the sunlight and shadow playing tricks on his eyes - then suddenly- <p> LINCOLN BURSTS OUT OF THE DUST - from the left - tackling the pale man - both of them toppling - tumbling down the slope  --  <p> THUDDING TO A HALT at the lip of the lode-canal - the rainmaker lost in the fall - the impact throwing up a billow of dust  --  <p> THE DUSTCLOUD - Diggs and Lincoln struggling , clawing , punching - Lincoln , with surprise on his side , gaining with the upper hand  --  <p> DIGGS ' CLAWING FINGERS discover Lincoln 's knife - tugging it from his jacket - Lincoln grabbing his wrist , fighting for control - <p> THE KNIFE MOVING BETWEEN THEM - Diggs with better leverage - the blade inching towards Lincoln 's face - pressing into his cheek  --  <p> LINCOLN 'S EYES - welling black , almost inhuman - the sense of danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's throat - <p> DIGGS ' EYES - bulging as he strains to push the knife home - oxygen draining - conscious ebbing - he slumps back - <p> LINCOLN REGAINS THE KNIFE - the pale man seems to be out cold - but he 's not sure - he pauses holding the blade over him , then  --  <p> - BOOM-  THE KNIFE FLIES FROM HIS GRIP IN A BURST OF DISCHARGE - <p> BURDON SNAPS AIM FOR ANOTHER SHOT - beading - his target moving now - dropping out of the firing line - into the lode-canal  --  <p> BURDON INCHES TOWARD THE EDGE - thunderbolt angling downward - into the trench - then suddenly he 's GRABBED BY THE ANKLES - <p> LINCOLN STRAINING to overbalance the giant - feet up against the wall - like trying to topple a tree - finally winning some give- <p> BURDON TOPPLES INTO THE TRENCH - his ankles clamped by his quarry - both men meeting the concrete with a bone-shaking- <p> - THUD-  LINCOLN IS CRUSHED BENEATH THE MASSIVE WEIGHT - the giant already recovering from the fall - now dragging him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - hurling his quarry across the trench - moving in quickly , following up with a kick  --  <p> - THUD-  LINCOLN CRUMPLES as the boot smacks into him - then another kick - then another - the world starts blurring  --  <p> BURDON TURNS AWAY - his quarry disabled for now - he recovers his thunderbolt - turns back to administer the coup de grace  --  <p> LINCOLN LOOKS UP - the giant looming - the muzzle of his weapon thrumming with energy - the rivets on his denims start rattling  --  <p> BURDON SPINS ROUND - the thunderbolt suddenly ripped from his grasp - there , in the distance - AN EASTBOUND BARGE IS COMING - <p> LINCOLN SCRAMBLES UP THE WALL OF THE TRENCH - muscles straining , feet slipping on the concrete - escaping the imminent vessel  --  <p> DIGGS COMING TO - now seeing his quarry a short distance away - emerging from the lode-canal - he looks around for a weapon , then- <p> BURDON ( O.S. ) Diggs ! Get me outta here ! <p> BURDON STRUGGLING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE TRENCH - with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own weight  --  <p> DIGGS REACHING THE EDGE - seeing the eastbound barge coming - grabbing his partner 's outreached hand - pulling him upward - <p> BURDON 'S PANIC - his other arm flinging away - HIS METAL BRACE SNARED BY THE LODE-STREAM - the force shuddering his entire body- <p> DIGGS PULLING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT - feet slipping - locked in a tug of war with the lodestream - THE BARGE IS CLOSING FAST  --  <p> BURDON 'S HORROR - now suspended between the two forces - feet kicking - THE BARGE IS ALMOST UPON HIM - he screams agonized  --  <p> # BURDON # Help me ! HELP MEEEEE ! <p> THE SCREAM IS INSTANTLY LOST in the whoosh of the barge . Diggs , stunned , just looks at his hands , empty , spattered with blood . <p> # DIGGS # Burdie ... ? <p> THE SHADOW OF THE ROCK - Lincoln rejoins Ester - casting a look back - the eastbound barge now plummeting into the distance  --  <p> DIGGS STOOPING AT THE EDGE OF THE TRENCH - looking down - all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concrete  --  <p> LINCOLN AND ESTER REACHING THE FOOT OF THE ROCKS - seeing THE WESTBOUND BARGE against the sunrise - snaking into the passage  --  <p> DIGGS PULLING UPRIGHT - spotting his quarry - fire in his eyes - drawing out a boot-knife - slipping it between his teeth  --  <p> THE WESTBOUND BARGE pulling through the canyon - lode-poles pulsing ahead of it - polarity thrumming in opposing flow  --  <p> LINCOLN AND ESTER start running as the barge comes towards them - Lincoln pulling Ester along - struggling to match the pace  --  <p> A SOUND LIKE A BEATING TYMPANY COMING TOWARDS THEM - they look round to see - A SHADOW RUNNING ALONG THE TOP OF THE BARGE  --  <p> DIGGS FLINGING HIMSELF OFF THE BARGE - the blade in his teeth - arms spread - for an instant , like a vulture against the sun  --  <p> LINCOLN IS SUDDENLY CRUSHED by the weight of his landing - ESTER IS HURLED SIDEWAYS - into a ditch - lost in a cloud of dust  --  <p> DIGGS PULLING HIMSELF UP , astride of Lincoln - snatching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a whetstone  --  <p> LINCOLN SPITTING DIRT - suddenly grabbed by the scalp and tugged sideways - twisted partways onto his back , forced to look up at  --  <p> A BLACK SPOT AGAINST THE SUN - Diggs ' face set in a murderous sneer - he wants to see this fucker 's eyes - the torment  --  <p> LINCOLN DAZZLED BY THE SUNLIGHT - but suddenly knowing the face of death - now catching the brief glint of the knife as  --  <p> DIGGS PLUNGES THE BLADE DOWN - slicing into his quarry 's hand as he throws it up in defense - his quarry YOWLING WITH PAIN  --  <p> LINCOLN FEELING THE STAB - his deepest instinct suddenly awoken - every impulse , every fiber brought into alignment - survival  --  <p> DIGGS IS HURLED INTO THE AIR as Lincoln surges upward - he tumbles backward into the dust - losing hold of the boot-knife  --  <p> LINCOLN PUSHES HIMSELF UPRIGHT - only makes it half-way - scrambling towards the pale man - all fours , like an animal  --  <p> DIGGS CLAWING AROUND IN THE DUST - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up - slashing at his imminent quarry  --  <p> LINCOLN RECOILING - the blade nicking his face - sudden rage - grabbing the pale man by the arm - swinging him round into  --  <p> - BOOM-  THE MOVING WALL OF FREIGHT CONTAINERS - as the westbound barge passes - Diggs bounces off - stumbling to keep balance  --  <p> LINCOLN ON THE RETREAT - the pale man coming at him with the knife - another nick - seeing a gap now , shoving him backwards  --  <p> - BOOM-  THE MOVING WALL RESOUNDS - Diggs howls - snagged by a bolt - hurt , his fury becomes incandescent - he strikes madly  --  <p> LINCOLN STUMBLING BACK - the pale man coming at him - the blade flashing to and fro - frenzied - like a threshing machine  --  <p> FORCING HIM UP AGAINST THE ROCKS - the knife almost upon him - he grits his teeth and lunges forward - charging like a bull  --  <p> DIGGS CAREENS BACKWARD , still swiping the blade - digging into his quarry - headlong towards the moving wall - hitting with  --  <p> - WHUMP-  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit a gap between the containers and HIS HEAD HAS BEEN LOPPED OFF - <p> LINCOLN STANDS HORRIFIED - as the headless body is spun by the moving wall - dropping into the trench as the barge tails off- <p> The westbound barge gains speed , leaving the canyon . But there is Ester , running after it , vainly , coughing and sputtering . <p> # LINCOLN # Ester ! Stop ! It 's no use ! <p> # ESTER # We have to ... get to ... The Island ... <p> # LINCOLN # It 's going too fast ! <p> # ESTER # We have to ... get to ... <p> Ester staggers a few more steps , then collapses to her knees , rasping for breath . As Lincoln reaches her , she slumps back into his arms . Her head lolling , eyes rolled back to white , a drool of blood spilling from her lips . Then the blast of a claxon cuts the air as the westbound barge disappears into the distance . <p> FADE TO BLACK . <p> 172 EXT . SEDONA - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere . Long shadows . <p> 173 INT . STUDIO - RANCH HOME - LATE AFTERNOON <p> Late golden sunlight through a mist of sawdust . Abstract wood sculptures are visible . Juniper wood , carved along the bias of the grain , polished to accentuate the curves of natural growth . AN OLDER WOMAN runs a sander over a work in progress - 60 's , in coveralls , gray her tied back , her face shielded by goggles and a bandana . She pauses to review her work , shutting down the sander , slipping off her goggles and bandana . Her face is eerily familiar . Her name is KATHERINE . She now moves to the window , catching sight of something outside . Curiously , she watches a vehicle coming down the long driveway . A dusty , grey cutter . <p> 174 EXT . FRONT PORCH - RANCH HOME - LATE AFTERNOON <p> Katherine opens the front door . The cutter is now docked in the port and a stranger is staggering towards her . In his arms , is an unconscious woman . Now Katherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Her voice comes in a chilled whisper- <p> # KATHERINE # Oh , God ... Oh , my God ... <p> 175 EXT . PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON <p> A whisper cuts across the glistening skyline towards The Sanger Industries Tower . It circles in to land on a rooftop helipad . <p> 176 INT . CROWNE 'S OFFICE - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER <p> Silence . Crowne sits at her desk . Merrick sits across from her . Waiting . The air stirs as the secretary ushers Dr. Sanger into the office . No greetings are exchanged . Sanger just lowers into a chair , a little unsettled to find Merrick has preceded him . <p> # CROWNE # I take it you 've heard the news . <p> DR . SANGER The bond agents . Yes . Unfortunate . <p> # CROWNE # Unfortunate ? ( pauses , lights a cigarette ) We 're way past unfortunate , Henry . <p> DR . SANGER I thought we 'd covered ourselves . <p> # CROWNE # The police wo n't connect the bond agents to us . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> DR . SANGER What are you talking about ? <p> # MERRICK # The male agnate tracked him down . <p> # CROWNE # His name 's Thomas Lincoln . It seems they had a genetic reunion . Not a happy one . It was all I could do to stop him going to the authorities . <p> DR . SANGER I still do n't see the problem . <p> # CROWNE # He may not want a police involvement but he 's already threatened to file suit . And he 's one of the biggest litigation attorneys in the city . <p> DR . SANGER That 's why we have you , Ellen . <p> # CROWNE # That 's why I asked Bernard to come out here . To find out how it happened . <p> # MERRICK # I told her , Henry . About synesthesia . <p> Sanger casts a betrayed look at Merrick . Then returns to Crowne- <p> DR . SANGER It was a marginal problem . And it was under control - according to Bernard . <p> # CROWNE # That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this instance , it puts us in breach of the clone laws . <p> DR . SANGER It does n't even touch their genetics . <p> # CROWNE # I 'm talking about self-awareness . The virtual humanity statutes require us to give them consciousness to the level of functionality . But not beyond . <p> This gives Sanger pause . Crowne drags her cigarette acutely . <p> # CROWNE # Legally , we are naked on every level . Federal legislature , state licensing , sponsorship contract ... But even if we did manage to weather the legal storm , we 'd never survive the public scrutiny . <p> Sanger absorbs this , calmly shaking a pill from his pill bottle . <p> DR . SANGER I 've spent my entire career facing down naysayers , Ellen . Do n't think for a second I 'm afraid of facing them now . <p> # CROWNE # You remember cryogenics ? At the outset , people dismissed it as a rich man 's folly . Eccentric millionaires freezing their brains , hoping to wake up in a new body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of making it feasible , it was n't moral affront that caused the backlash . It was the scope . The scope , Henry . When the size of the customer base was exposed , it screamed inequality - one medicine for the rich and one for the poor . The pressure for accessible cryo-genics as good as buried the industry . ( a pause for emphasis ) Our graves are being dug as we speak , gentlemen . Every passing second , they get deeper . If we 're going to survive , we have to act swiftly and decisively . <p> DR . SANGER Alright . What do you suggest ? <p> Sanger dry swallows the pill . Ellen opens a contract folder . <p> # CROWNE # Our security chief - I 've been looking at his file . Ex-marine , served in South China - do we think he still has it in him ? <p> DR . SANGER ( realizing , suddenly harsh ) Are you insane ? <p> Their eyes deadlock . Crowne gives Merrick a sideways glance . <p> # CROWNE # You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why he does n't avail himself of his own technology ? <p> DR . SANGER An agnate could give me a new heart but to get it to function mentally ... <p> # CROWNE # Bullshit , Henry . Bullshit . You do n't want to deal with reality . Only with concept . I may not have been there at the start but I heard the stories . You wanted in on every aspect of construction , from environmental design right down to the classical playlists . It was n't enough just to make it work , was it ? No , you wanted your own little utopia . <p> CROWNE ( cont 'd ) Swanning around in your mountain retreat like some self-appointed deity . But when it comes to getting your hands dirty ... <p> DR . SANGER Are you quite finished ? <p> # CROWNE # Even God has blood on his hands , Henry . Are you going to watch it all go up in flames or are you going to deal with it ? <p> Sanger crosses to the window , looking down onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there ... ? Running east from the stadium . My father used to take me to church on that street . An old Spanish church . <p> # CROWNE # What 's your point ? <p> DR . SANGER I did n't know they 'd torn it down . <p> 177 INT . GUEST BEDROOM - KATHERINE 'S HOUSE - EVENING <p> A floral bedroom . Ester lies in bed , wheezing , semi-conscious . Katherine slips a pill between her lips and tips in some water . Lincoln stands watching . Katherine ushers him out of the room . <p> 178 INT . KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS <p> The kitchen is arrayed with modern technology but softened with paintings and craftwork . Art marginally overwhelming science . Katherine starts making some herb tea in the traditional manner . <p> # LINCOLN # What did you give her ? <p> # KATHERINE # Just something to help her sleep . I think she has a bronchial infection . But I 'm not sure I should give her an antibiotic in case it effects the baby . <p> # LINCOLN # So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality sinking its claws . She looks at him- <p> # KATHERINE # Is n't that why you came here ? <p> # LINCOLN # I found your name in the listings . I was n't sure . You do n't look like her . <p> # KATHERINE # They have a plan ... For women like me . <p> # LINCOLN # So you 're the one who takes her baby . <p> Katherine winces at him . It 's uttered so matter-of-factly . She pauses , hanging her head , searching within herself . <p> # KATHERINE # You know when you 're young ? How you run around thinking you 're immortal ? <p> Lincoln 's look says he has no idea . She seems not to notice . <p> # KATHERINE # There was a lodeway accident . I was ... damaged . After that , I thought no man would ever want me . I was wrong . His name was John . He said he married me for my eyes . Ocean eyes , he called them . He always loved the ocean . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Off her gesture , Lincoln glances at the wall . A watercolor of a yacht . Meaningless to him but Katherine gazes it at , fondly- <p> # KATHERINE # But I think there was always an unspoken regret between us . When we heard about the technology , it was like ... forgive-ness , like a second chance . A child of our own , part of both of us . Sailing trips , fishing trips , so many plans ... ( a flat beat ) John got cancer a year ago . He died . <p> Her eyes mist , distant and bittersweet , talking to herself now . <p> # KATHERINE # Ironic . That the same technology could have saved his life . And now the baby is the only part of him I have left . And the boat . I still have the boat . <p> Lincoln looks discomfited . There 's more to this than he thought . <p> 179 INT . MOTEL ROOM - EVENING <p> Scheer opens the door . Merrick stands at the threshold with an attache case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # SCHEER # I told you we should n't have gone to outside personnel . They were cowboys . <p> # MERRICK # We had no choice , Karl . We had to keep this away from The Institute . <p> # SCHEER # And now ? <p> Merrick lowers in a chair , grim and leaden . He opens his attache and pulls out a contract folder . He hands it to Scheer . <p> # SCHEER # What 's this ? <p> # MERRICK # Your resignation papers . Maybe early retirement ' would be more accurate ... <p> Scheer leans forward , frowning , curious . <p> # MERRICK # Ten platinum bounty - if you sign the papers , their loss becomes your gain . <p> # SCHEER # A parachute ... So there 's a jump ? <p> # MERRICK # You understand that whatever happens , The Institute must be able to deny it . <p> Scheer says nothing . Merrick reaches in the attache and pulls out a case . Inside are a row of ampules and a pressure syringe-gun . <p> # MERRICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's called di-halcyonate . It reacts on a molecular level to start a process of internal combustion . The subject is incinerated from the inside out . In post-mortem application it 's done its job before rigor mortis . In a live subject , well ... you can imagine . <p> # SCHEER # You want to dispose of your products . <p> # MERRICK # It 's a little more complicated than that . We have to be very ... thorough . If you still have it in you , that is . <p> Scheer gives him a sideways look . Then displays the USMC ring . <p> # SCHEER # Why do you think I still wear this ? <p> # MERRICK # I do n't know . <p> # SCHEER # I was discharged from the marines for insubordination . If you asked anyone in my unit , they 'd call it heroism . I disobeyed an order to fall back . I took out a bunker complex single-handed . <p> # MERRICK # So you wear it is a badge of honor ? <p> # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't afraid of dying . I just did n't care . You see , I suddenly realized I was just a sack of flesh with a heartbeat . Life , death , I just could n't see the point anymore . <p> Merrick allows a respectful pause , then- <p> # MERRICK # You 'll find a vehicle parked outside . It 's unregistered , difficult to trace . I take it we have an agreement ... ? <p> 180 INT . KATHERINE 'S BEDROOM - NIGHT <p> A slant of light falls across Ester , writhing in her sleep , rasping . Katherine and Lincoln peer in through the doorway , checking on her . Then Katherine quietly closes the door . <p> 181 INT . KATHERINE 'S KITCHEN - NIGHT <p> Lincoln paces around , feeling useless . Katherine considers him- <p> # KATHERINE # What do I call you ? <p> # LINCOLN # Lincoln . My name 's Lincoln . <p> # KATHERINE # Lincoln , I think she needs professional help . I think she needs to see a doctor . <p> # LINCOLN # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . <p> # KATHERINE # Not if I do n't want them to . <p> # LINCOLN # You do n't understand . They do n't want people to know about her . Either of us . <p> # KATHERINE # The doctor I 'm thinking of , he 's an old friend . He look after John in the final stages . I trust him . <p> # LINCOLN # Why ? So you can take her baby ? <p> # KATHERINE # No . No , that 's not what I want . <p> Off Lincoln 's blunt look , she sighs , lowering into a chair . <p> # KATHERINE # Maybe I did n't realize she 'd be so ... ( cuts off , a deep pause ) Maybe I just did n't want to . Either way , I was wrong . I want you to know that . I was wrong ... And I 'm sorry . <p> A heavy lull . Lincoln hangs his head , remembering . <p> # LINCOLN # They make you believe there 's a place called The Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . They cut you open . They take pieces of you . <p> Katherine looks at him , intuiting . She allows a pause , then- <p> # KATHERINE # Even if I had taken her baby , I swear to you , I 'd never have ... They give you a choice , you see , to extend the sponsorship after ... after delivery . <p> # LINCOLN # No . I saw a lot of us go to The Island . But I never saw anyone come back . <p> # KATHERINE # You mean ... Even if I had extended the sponsorship , they 'd have ... and kept taking the money ? But that 's inhuman . <p> # LINCOLN # ( beat , a lost look ) Is it ? I would n't know . <p> 182 INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - EVENING <p> A sleek low vehicle known as a " straker " pulls down the ramp . <p> 183 INT . APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING <p> The orbs on the doors eyeball Scheer , moving up the corridor . He stops at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door- <p> # TOM # Yes ? <p> # SCHEER # I 'm from the Sanger Institute . <p> # TOM # I 've given you people enough of my time already . <p> # SCHEER # It 's just a formality . I need to see your sponsorship contract . <p> Tom pauses then lets Scheer inside . He crosses to the wall safe , taps the keys . Then pulls out the contract folder . He offers it . <p> # SCHEER # Is this the only copy ? <p> # TOM # Why would I make copies ? Do you think I want anyone else to know about this ? <p> Scheer accepts the folder . As Tom turns to close the safe , he sets it down . And grabs Tom from behind , by the scalp , pressing the syringe-gun into his jugular . A HISS . Tom clutches his throat like it 's on fire . With a boiling gurgle , he staggers forward . Sweating , collapsing . Convulsing , belching steam . Then falling slack . His skin starts to smolder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , leaving it to burn with him . <p> 184 EXT . NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - PHOENIX - NIGHT <p> Establishing . A clean facade of white steel and glass . A hatch-back vehicle known as a " corsair " pulls down the parking ramp . <p> 185 INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - NIGHT <p> The corsair pulls up at the ER entrance , Lincoln at the wheel . Katherine gets out of the passenger side . A doctor is waiting - 50 's , caring face . His name is DR . ABRAMS . He looks curiously at the man at the wheel . Then greets Katherine with a hug - <p> DR . ABRAMS Katherine ... It 's good to see you . I have n't seen you since John 's funeral . <p> # KATHERINE # Well I 've been keeping busy . Trying to . Thanks for coming down to meet me . <p> DR . ABRAMS Your call was a little cryptic . What is it exactly that 's wrong with you ? <p> # KATHERINE # It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear door of the corsair . Ester is lying on the back seat . Dr. Abrams frowns as he notices the resemblance . <p> 186 EXT . THE RANCH HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT <p> The straker pulls up into the port . <p> 187 INT . THE STUDIO / MAIN HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT <p> The shadow of Scheer moving outside the windows , looking for a point of entry . He inspects the studio door for alarms . Then elbows the glass . Reaching inside , turning the lock . He enters the studio , glancing at the sculptures . Moving through the home . <p> Silently , systematically , checking the rooms . He reaches the guest bedroom , looks around . Something catches his eye . Spots of blood of the linens . Eyes honing , he moves on into the kitchen . <p> He discovers a holocom keypad on the counter . Taps some keys . The holoframe flashes " REDIALLING " . The holoframe snows with static . Then a receptionist 's face appears- <p> RECEPTIONIST ( ON HOLOCOM ) New Gaza Hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAITING ROOM - NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER <p> Lincoln stands waiting . There are chairs but he 's too tense to sit . Katherine and Dr. Abrams now enter . Lincoln looks at them , expectantly . There 's a pause . Then Dr. Abrams speaks- <p> DR . ABRAMS Your friend ... she has pneumonia . At a very advanced stage . Its progress has been unchecked by her immune system . <p> # LINCOLN # Can you help her ? <p> DR . ABRAMS We have two options ... One is a super-biotic . But there 's the risk her immune system might bow out of the fight . The other is a nodal transfusion . Katherine has agreed to be the donor . But the new antibodies may not conform fully . They may decide to attack the baby ... <p> # LINCOLN # I do n't understand any of this . <p> # KATHERINE # He means that by trying to help her , we could lose her . Or lose the baby . <p> DR . ABRAMS Or , if we do nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we do n't act , the infection will take over . <p> Lincoln lowers into a chair . He feels a pain somewhere . He ca n't quite pin down where . Or what caused it . Or why it hurts so bad . <p> 189 INT . HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT <p> Ester lies in bed , dozing , looking more relaxed . Her oxygen mask makes breathing easier . Lincoln enters and sits beside her . She stirs , meeting his eye with a faint smile . Lincoln returns it- <p> # LINCOLN # Hello , stranger . <p> # ESTER # You look tired , Lincoln . <p> # LINCOLN # Ester ... <p> # ESTER # It 's okay . I know . Katherine told me . <p> She sits up , lowering her mask . Her hand finding his . <p> # ESTER # She told me a lot of things . About how they used a tiny part of her to make me . She said it was n't so very different . <p> # LINCOLN # What do you mean ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... From having a baby . <p> Lincoln nods . A pause . Ester continues , more troubled , wheezing- <p> # ESTER # She told me how they use us ... And I keep thinking ... about the others ... the ones we left behind , about how they 'll never know ... how they 'll ... <p> Ester 's out of breath again , coughing . Lincoln helps her put the oxygen mask back over her mouth . Ester slumps back , relaxing . Off Lincoln 's worried look , she smiles at him with her eyes- <p> # ESTER # I 'm going to be okay , Lincoln . <p> # LINCOLN # I know . <p> But even to his own ears , the affirmation sounds hollow . <p> 190 INT . MEN 'S ROOM - HOSPITAL - NIGHT <p> The stream of water gushes into Lincoln 's hands . He splashes his face . Then looks at himself in the mirror . He looks sallow from sleeplessness . The facial hair makes him look like a shadow of his former self . For an instant he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Like etherscreen . Then he sees it 's just a humidifier on the far wall . Tension ebbing , he splashes some more water . When he looks up again , he sees his pupils are dilating . The sense of danger . His voice comes in a cold whisper- <p> # LINCOLN # No ... <p> 191 INT . HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT <p> Lincoln emerges from the restroom , scanning for the danger 's source . Figures flash past in scrubs , white coats . Then he sees it . The figure emerging from the elevator . The face of Scheer ... <p> 192 INT . PREP ROOM - NIGHT <p> A flurry of disturbance from the nurses as someone barges into the room . Dr. Abrams is prepping Katherine for the transfusion . Off the ruckus , he looks up . Lincoln comes up to them , urgently- <p> # LINCOLN # We have to go . We have to get her out . <p> # KATHERINE # What are you talking about ? <p> # LINCOLN # He 's come for her . For us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't move her . She 's already under sedation . <p> Lincoln look to see Ester , asleep on the OR table beyond . <p> # LINCOLN # How long before she wakes up ? <p> DR . ABRAMS The procedure takes three hours but ... <p> # LINCOLN # ( to Katherine , emphatic ) You 'll take care of it , wo n't you ? Take her somewhere they ca n't find her ... <p> Katherine , understanding , simply nods . Lincoln takes a last look at Ester , then departs . Dr. Abrams , bemused , turns to Katherine- <p> DR . ABRAMS Katherine , what the hell 's going on ? <p> 193 EXT . HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT <p> Lincoln moves up the corridor , purpose in his stride . His black gaze fixed on Scheer , making an inquiry at the nurse 's station . Lincoln does n't even break stride .

ENTRANCE - HOLSPAR STADIUM - NIGHT <p> The straker pulls up at the smashed gate arm . In the booth , a holoserve parking attendant greets the arrival with a smile- <p> # PARKING ATTENDANT # Welcome to Holspar Stadium , home of the Phoenix Admirals , parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the straker . He looks down at the crashsite below . The parking lot , like a marina , is filled to capacity . A game is in progress . A corona of light coming from the stadium . Hoots , music , the roaring crowd . Over which , sirens can now be heard . Scheer draws the syringe-gun and heads down the ramp . <p> 199 EXT . PARKING LOT - HOLSPAR STADIUM - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER <p> Dust blooms from the crashsite . Scheer crouches , peering down at the wrecked corsair . The burst windshield , the dangling driver side door shows his quarry has escaped the wreckage . He rises and scans around . On the concrete , a trail of blood is visible . <p> 200 INT . STORAGE AREA - HOLSPAR STADIUM - MINUTES LATER <p> The blood trail leads down a gloomy stairwell . The game is just audible overhead . Lincoln stumbles down the steps , clutching his bleeding arm . Between pain and concussion , he loses his footing and falls . He tumbles down the remaining steps to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supplies - edgers , aerators , spray rigs , drums of insecticides , herbicides . For a moment , Lincoln lies stunned . Then hears a noise and rolls over . He looks up the stairwell . A shadow is descending towards him . <p> With painful effort , Lincoln starts crawling across the floor , eyes fixed on the shadow . Tensing as A HANDGUN noses out of the darkness . Then A STADIUM SECURITY GUARD steps into the light - <p> # SECURITY GUARD # You , what are you doing down here ? <p> Now he sees Lincoln more closely - injured , his arm bleeding . <p> # SECURITY GUARD # Oh , Jesus ... Are you okay , son ? <p> Lincoln eases a little as he sees the security guard lower his weapon . Then suddenly the guard is JERKED BACK BY THE SCALP . <p> A HISS . Now suddenly the guard jettisons the handgun , clutching his throat like it 's on fire . With a boiling gurgle , he staggers forward . Streaming with sweat . Toppling across a herbicide drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls slack . <p> Scheer is at the foot of the steps , discarding the spent ampule from the syringe-gun . Now screwing a fresh ampule into place . <p> Lincoln turns to him , realizing what he 's just witnessed is a glimpse of his own fate . He pushes himself upright , bracing . <p> Scheer looks at him . Clutching his bloody arm , barely able to stay upright , but still ready to fight for life . He half-smiles- <p> # SCHEER # I 'm jealous of you . You have a reason to live . I ca n't say I 've ever had that ... <p> Lincoln holds his gaze , looking deep in his eyes . Then , as if scared by what he sees there , starts inching away , glancing at  --  <p> THE GUARD 'S BODY SMOLDERING - lowering , melting through the drum- <p> SCHEER MOVING FORWARD , the smile leaving his face .

If there was anyone down there , they 're a pile of ashes now . <p> FADE TO BLACK . <p> 202 EXT . CEMETERY - SOME DAYS LATER <p> Peace . Sunlight . A bell tolling in the background . We make out Katherine , dressed in black , standing at a grave . The headstone reads simply : " Here Lies Ester &; Her Unborn Son - May They Rest In Peace " . There are no dates . Katherine lays down some flowers then looks across at Dr. Abrams . As he escorts her away , we see Crowne crossing towards them . She introduces herself delicately- <p> # CROWNE # Mrs. Ester ? My name is Ellen Crowne . <p> 203 INT . CEO 'S OFFICE - THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY <p> A celestial penthouse office . Katherine enters with Crowne . Merrick and Dr. Sanger rise to greet her . Strained solemnity . <p> DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to offer my deepest condolences . <p> His insincerity is transparent . Katherine just nods stiffly . <p> DR . SANGER This is Bernard Merrick our facility director . He knew Ester personally . <p> # MERRICK # And it 's a terrible loss . <p> More insincerity . Katherine nods again . Then settles in a chair . Crowne allows a respectful pause . Then begins with due delicacy- <p> # CROWNE # Legal issues must seem trivial at this time . But the sponsorship agreement has certain conditions relating to confident-iality . Despite this tragic turn of events , those conditions remain binding . We want to be sure you understand that . <p> # KATHERINE # I see . <p> # CROWNE # That said , The Institute is likewise bound by the terms of sponsorship and while we reserve every right ... <p> # KATHERINE # You can stop there . I know why I 'm here . You wanted to know if I 'm going to sue you for breach of contract . <p> DR . SANGER Nothing so devious , Mrs. Ester . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this incident . <p> # KATHERINE # I do n't want restitution , Dr. Sanger . The reason I agreed to this meeting was to have the chance to talk to you . <p> DR . SANGER Of course . Please ... <p> # KATHERINE # I never got to meet you when I visited The Institute . It was one of your sales-men who led the tour . I remember how he described the agnates as if they were some kind of mindless organisms . More like livestock than humanity ... <p> # CROWNE # Legally , human rights do n't apply . <p> DR . SANGER Do n't interrupt , Ellen . <p> # KATHERINE # I remember how eager I was to believe him . But when I saw what I 'd created , in flesh and blood , when I touched her , it was I who felt less than human . <p> DR . SANGER I understand . <p> He looks at her expressively . Perhaps he really does understand . <p> # KATHERINE # Ester 's life was my responsibility and her death is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to sue you , Dr. Sanger ... ( beat , a sudden ominous tone ) But I am going to blame you . Until the day I die , I will silently curse your name . That 's what I wanted you to know . <p> She drives it home with a horrible look . Sanger accepts it with due gravity . There 's an ugly pause . Katherine gets to her feet . <p> # KATHERINE # And now I 'd like to leave , please . <p> # CROWNE # We do have other issues to discuss ... <p> DR . SANGER No , Ellen , that 's enough . I think Mrs. Ester has said all there is to say . <p> 204 EXT . STREET - OUTSIDE THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY <p> Katherine descends the steps from the entrance . She crosses to a black funeral sedan , parked kerbside . Dr. Abrams stands waiting- <p> DR . ABRAMS I hope you know what you 're doing . <p> # KATHERINE # I do n't think they suspected anything . <p> DR . ABRAMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line for you , Katherine . <p> # KATHERINE # I know ... But it felt good . It felt like something John would have done . <p> 205 INT . ROOFTOP FLIGHTPAD - THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER <p> Crowne escorts Sanger and Merrick to the waiting whisper . <p> # CROWNE # Well , I do n't know about the two of you but I 'd say we got off lightly . <p> DR . SANGER Did we ? <p> # CROWNE # Do n't start getting maudlin , Henry . It 's a little too late in the game . <p> She shakes their hands as they climb into the whisper . Then watches it take off , ascending into the blinding sunlight . <p> DISSOLVE TO : <p> 206 EXT . THE SANGER INSTITUTE - SOME WEEKS LATER <p> Air blasts up from the giant funnel . Widening , we re-establish the huge ring , the processing plant , the giant appendages of ducting , the immutable red rocks . The shot sequence , reprising . From the processing plant , over the main complex . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following the lodeway out to the perimeter wall . The gateway now gliding open to disclose a view of the shimmering desert . Out in the distance , the institute liner emerging from the shimmer . The crosshatch insignia . <p> 207 INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY <p> Through the polarized glass we see the liner has docked . A TOUR GROUP is disembarking . Another parade of plutocracy , aging bloated me and brittle young women . They filter inside to be greeted by the courtesy staff , led by the ever-perky LYDIA . <p> # LYDIA # Ladies and gentlemen , my name is Lydia and on behalf of our staff , I 'd like to welcome you to The Sanger Institute . Before we start the tour , we 'll be serv-ing refreshments in the visitor center and circulating our standard discretion agreements . I should add that today you are all very lucky because our CEO and founder , Dr. Henry Sanger , is with us and will be leading the tour personally . <p> 208 INT . VISITOR CENTER - THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingle at a buffet . We isolate a casually dressed man , lightly bearded , in a Phoenix Admirals cap , crossing to Lydia . She turns to greet him with a smile- <p> # LYDIA # Yes ... Mr. Thomas , is n't it ? <p> The man tilts up to reveal his face . We see he is LINCOLN ... <p> # LINCOLN # I ca n't find my sunglasses . I think I left them on the shuttle . <p> # LYDIA # Well we 're about to start the tour . But I can have someone check for you . <p> # LINCOLN # Do n't worry . I 'll catch up . <p> 209 EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - DAY <p> Lincoln moves quickly along the wall towards the back of the complex . Hugging the shadows , scanning for onlookers . There is the processing plant and there , the ring of funnels . The sight brings a sudden rush of memories , painful memories , horrors . <p> Lincoln steels himself , then breaks from shadow and races for the nearest funnel . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the funnel and he pulls himself up . Reaching the lip , he finds the funnel mouth has been gridded over . Then he hears- <p> A VOICE ( O.S. ) Sir , this is a restricted area ... <p> Lincoln lowers back to the ground . He finds himself facing A TECHNICIAN in a hardhat . His uniform reads " Air Processing " . <p> 210 INT . ELEVATOR - PROCESSING PLANT <p> The doors slide open and the technician enters , stiffly . Then suddenly topples forward , pistol whipped from behind . Lincoln enters the elevator , a familiar handgun clenched in his fist . <p> 211 INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT <p> Looking up an elevator shaft . The red pulse of the lode-poles , rippling downward as the elevator descends from the surface . <p> 212 INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING <p> Lincoln is now wearing the technician 's uniform . He watches the panel lights flashing down . " Level 3 : Harvest " " Level 5 : Labor Decon " , " Level 7 : Labor Quarters " . His pupils are dilating but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must do . His gaze drifts down to " Level Twenty : Agnate Containment " . <p> 213 INT . THE ETHER GRID <p> The holographic rendering of containment spins in the vaulted chamber like a giant geometrical phantom . The ether blinks with blue dots in their hundreds as the agnates go about their day . <p> 214 INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM <p> Overlooking the ether , Ethercon sits at his console . The hiss of an opening door as someone enters . Ethercon looks round . He greets the technician 's arrival with an inquisitive look . Then the technician takes off his hardhat . A crosshatch on his brow . Ethercon reacts almost instantly , reaching for the console . Then instantly freezes as Lincoln presses the handgun to his skull . <p> 215 INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN <p> Pale blue light . Ethercon leads the way down a silent corridor . Lincoln follows him , the handgun firmly levelled on his head . <p> 216 INT . CHAMBER - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN <p> The pale blue light sustains . The chamber is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks . But instead of amber fluid , these contain blocks of ice . Beside each tank is a grid of bio-monitors . Ethercon stumbles into frame , prodded by Lincoln . Then , with a trembling finger points to one of the tanks . Lincoln holds aim on him and considers the glass facet . He wipes the condensation off the glass . Suspended in the block of ice is a shadow . A human figure . A device is attached to his stomach . Lincoln looks at the bio-monitors . A screen reads : <p> " PRODUCT ID : STARKWEATHER/ FOUNDATION : II/ GENERATION : DELTA " . <p> Lincoln looks across the EKG , the cardiograph , indications that Starkweather is still alive . Then he fixes on the RFI monitor . A resonant image of the brain . The shifting aura showing a level of consciousness . What thoughts must be going through that mind ? The fate of the agnates spared from expiration . To be kept on ice for future harvest . With a haggard look , Lincoln rests his hand on the glass where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SALES HALL - THE INSTITUTE - DAY <p> An embryo in mutated effigy hangs suspended in the amber fluid . Dr. Sanger stands at the wall of display tanks , mid-way through his sales pitch . He delivers it now with noticeably less gusto- <p> DR . SANGER Case in point , the clone . Back in the beginning , the mapping of the human genome was declared a historic landmark-to break the curse of heredity , to correct congenital defect ... genetic engineering became the brave new world of medical science . A bright future that led to a dark age and much of ... ( an abrupt pause , a frown ) ... legislation we know today . But while the clone laws may have narrowed the field , science marches on . Only to ... ( another abrupt pause ) I 'm sorry , I 'm f ... <p> Suddenly he clutches his arm , emitting a guttural gasp . <p> # LYDIA # Dr. Sanger ? <p> Sanger just looks at her . Then jolts from a spasm , clawing at his chest . His knees buckling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass , he slides dreadfully to the ground . <p> # LYDIA # He 's having a heart attack ! A doctor ! Somebody get a doctor in here ! <p> The tour group keeps their distance , unsettled by the face of mortality . Sanger is now lying in contortion on the floor , his gaping eyes fixed on the display tank . The embryo in mutated effigy , rocking about in the amber fluid . The sight of this little human monster is one that will follow him to the grave . <p> 218 INT . DIRECTOR 'S OFFICE - CONTAINMENT <p> The glass wall looks down on the avenue and the agnates milling beneath . Merrick sits at his console . Business as usual . Off a buzz , he taps a button . The door opens and A CENSOR bursts in- <p> # CENSOR # Sir , I 've been trying to contact you . It 's the ether ... Something 's wrong . <p> Merrick taps another button and the glass wall frosts over .

An agnate in an apartment , watching on a wall panel . <p> P/B JUMP CUT TO : A STILL IMAGE OF STARKWEATHER 'S STORAGE TANK . THE BLINKING GRID OF BIO-MONITORS . THE SHADOW IN THE BLOCK OF ICE . <p> We are still in the apartment when the playback cuts out . The agnate looks around as every piece of glass dissolves to trans-parency . The mirror panels , the frosted walls , the window , which now shows no view at all . Just the gleam of a holographic lens . <p> 220 INT . DIRECTOR 'S OFFICE <p> Merrick looks down from the glass wall at the agnates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly up at him . <p> 221 INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM <p> Alarms sounding . The ether grid blinking with red dots . Ethercon sitting frozen at the console , the handgun pressed to his head . Lincoln stands over him . His face cast in a chill of vengeance . <p> 222 INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - DAY <p> A glass facade . A noise from within . A primal , guttural noise , building to a roar . Now warping as we drop to slow motion . The glass webbing , bursting open from within , the facade exploding in a GLITTERING SHOWER OF SHARDS ... <p> SLOW FADE TO BLACK . <p> 223 INT . BASEMENT - A YEAR LATER <p> No windows . No clue of where we may be . A safehouse somewhere . The passage of time is marked on Lincoln 's face , careworn , long hair , a full beard . He sits in front of a data tablet , his image recorded on its screen . His voice also seems older as he speaks- <p> # LINCOLN # It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting for things to quiet down . I do n't know how many made it out or how many who did , survived . I know there are people called politicians trying to say it never happened . That 's why I 've kept this journal . To keep the truth alive . Alive ... I 've learned what that means but it still confuses me . In functional terms , I 've been alive for ten years . In human terms , more than thirty . Human ... I 'm not sure about that one either . They say I 'm not human because I have no mother or father . I guess I have more to learn . But one word I do understand is hope . So maybe this journal will give hope - to those like me , who may be out there . To know they 're not alone . My name is Lincoln Six-Echo and this is my testament ... <p> He sits back , contemplating the screen with an air of closure . Then he stirs at a sound . At first just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of A BABY CRYING . Lincoln crosses to a cot . He lifts up a baby boy , 6 months old , bawling and squirming . <p> A WOMAN 'S VOICE ( O.S. ) Is he hungry again ? I just fed him . <p> Ester steps into the room , sleep-mussed , her beauty deepened by maternity . The baby reaches out for her . Lincoln hands him over- <p> # LINCOLN # Lincoln Junior , huh ? It still does n't sound right . That name . <p> # ESTER # It 's the name of his father . <p> She lovingly kisses him . Lincoln smiles at her , then the baby , sweeping the hair from the forehead . Unscarred , blemishless . <p> # LINCOLN # We should finish packing . <p> 224 EXT . JETTY - THE PACIFIC COAST - DAWN <p> A private jetty stretches out to a pile of supply canisters . A yacht is moored . We recognized it as John 's boat . And we recognize Katherine , holding the baby as Lincoln and Ester finish loading .
