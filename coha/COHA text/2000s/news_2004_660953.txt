<p> The food industry has already found out the dangers - and costs - of letting unauthorized biotech crops seep into the food supply . Now , another threat has emerged : seeds . <p> Traditional corn , soybeans , and canola seeds available for sale to American farmers have a tiny percentage of genetically modified ( GM ) seeds mixed in with them , a new study shows . The finding poses immediate challenges for farmers and nations trying to keep their crops GM-free . <p> It also raises key questions as GM acreage continues to increase worldwide . If the genie is out of the bottle for GM seeds approved for human consumption , what 's to prevent other experimental GM crops from moving into the food supply ? Do consumers want genes meant to produce drugs , plastics , and vaccines hiding in their corn flakes ? <p> " There is no reason to believe that the transgenes detected in this study are the only ones moving into the traditional seed supply , " concludes the study , released Feb. 23 by the Union of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cambridge , Mass . <p> It also says GM crops not approved for human consumption have been and continue to be field tested , leaving possible the contamination of traditional varieties . <p> Not so fast , industry groups counter . The UCS study found levels of GM seeds varying from only 0.05 percent to 1 percent mixed with traditional seeds , they point out . Shipments regularly contain similar amounts of other " off type " seed varieties that have nothing to do with genetic modification . Nor are there any indications that GM-modified crops pose any health hazard , these groups point out . <p> They add that as biotech crops become commercialized , their seeds will naturally find their way into traditional seed lots - but at very small levels . <p> " It is expected they will be held to reasonably low levels by the quality assurance procedures , " the American Seed Trade Association ( ASTA ) said in a statement . <p> In other words , " there are low levels that are there , but they 're allowed under seed laws , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multinational agribusiness that develops GM crops , in a phone interview . " There 's not a question of safety because all of these products have been approved for food use . " <p> And what about the GM crops being field tested for pharmaceutical and industrial purposes ? <p> The conclusion that these crops will comingle with traditional crops is not supported " by science , law , or practice , " Mr. Novak says . Companies like Syngenta have a self-interest not to allow pharma and industrial biotech crops into the food chain , he says , if for no other reason than " because of liability for us as a company . " <p> Syngenta uses several methods to keep experimental GM crops separate , including growing them in locations away from traditional crops . The GM crops also may be planted at a different time , meaning they would n't flower when traditional crops do , making cross-pollination impossible . Physical alterations , such as detassling corn , can also be used to prevent the spread of pollen . <p> But Jane Rissler , a scientist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps are n't enough . While she concedes that experimental GM crops are raised under tougher standards than other crops , the standards were only tightened recently . <p> " For many years they were not grown under as strict requirements as they are now , so in fact , contamination could have occurred then , " she says in a phone interview . " And I fear it still could occur now . " <p> With corn , for example , the possibility of gene flow from one variety to another is high . " Corn pollen can travel so far , " Dr. Rissler says . The insistence of seed companies that their pharmaceutical and industrial farming is safe " is not convincing to us and frankly it 's not convincing to the food industry , " which , she says , has " suggested very , very strongly that only nonfood crops be used to produce pharmaceuticals . " <p> StarLink story <p> The industry has already experienced the costs of letting unapproved GM crops enter the food supply . <p> In 2000 , StarLink , a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for human consumption , was found in taco shells and other grocery items , causing a public fury . <p> StarLink was removed from the market and its manufacturer , the French drugmaker Aventis , was forced to pay millions of dollars in legal settlements to corn farmers and grain handlers whose businesses were damaged by the controversy . <p> Not surprisingly , both seed producers and critics agree that no GM crops designed for nonfood use should enter the food chain . But the tricky question , experts suggest , is what level of GM seed deemed safe by the United States should be allowed in shipments labeled as non-GM seed ? <p> " There is no worldwide uniform standard about what constitutes an appropriate level of seed purity , " says Michael Fernandez of the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology , an independent think tank . This fall , Pew plans to host a conference that will look at ways to set testing standards of GM crops and seed purity . <p> In the US , producers are required to reveal only how much " off-type " seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any foreign substances , such as weeds . <p> These are " marketplace standards , " Mr. Fernandez says . " They 're not designed as safety standards . " GM seeds approved for consumption would simply be listed as one of the other varieties present , he says . " The assumption is that no seed on the market is 100 percent pure . " <p> However , GM " contamination " of traditional seed could become a problem for trade with nations who are much more skittish about GM foods , the UCS report suggests . <p> The British government announced Tuesday that it would allow the first commercial GM crop , a type of corn , to be planted there , despite howls of protest . The British Medical Association reported that GM foods were highly unlikely to be a health hazard . But a recent poll cited in the London Times showed that only 4 percent of Britons strongly favored GM food and would eat it , while 85 percent said GM crops would have a negative impact on the environment . <p> Skepticism also remains high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even in the US , Mendocino County in northern California voted last week to ban genetically engineered crops and animals . Other local governments are considering similar laws . <p> Last month , a meeting in Malaysia of more than 80 countries that have signed a UN protocol on biosafety agreed to require detailed labeling on international shipments of GM crops . ( They did not deal with the issue of standard seeds that contain traces of GM seeds . ) The US disagreed with the labeling plan , but because it has not signed the UN protocol it could attend the meeting only as an observer . <p> However , a report by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications ( ISAAA ) shows " hope for the future that biotech is continuing to gain acceptance as people have more understanding of the safety of these products , " Syngenta 's Novak says . <p> Global acreage devoted to GM crops grew by 15 percent to 167.3 million acres between 2002 and 2003 , according to the ISAAA . Nearly 61 percent of that acreage was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries ( US , Canada , China , South Africa , Argentina , and Brazil ) . In a boost for GM crops , China just gave a green light for seven varieties of foreign-grown GM crops to enter its market . <p> What next ? <p> The UCS report concludes that the mixing of GM traits into traditional seed supplies is " not entirely reversible , " but argues that it can be " substantially reduced . " More and deeper studies of GM " contamination " need to be done , the UCS says . <p> The UCS also calls for the Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) to conduct an investigation and for the USDA , the Food and Drug Administration , and the Environmental Protection Agency to amend regulations for GM pharmaceutical and industrial crops " to ensure that the seed supply for food and feed crops is not contaminated at any level with drugs , vaccines , plastics , or related substances . " <p> These government agencies have yet to respond to the UCS study , Rissler says . <p> How pure is US seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and canola seeds were tested by the Union of Concerned Scientists , the seeds were found to be contaminated with transgenic DNA at levels of roughly 0.05 to 1 percent . If these proportions were in US supplies , as much as 6,250 total tons of GM seeds would be entering the US food supply without proper labeling . A 1 percent level would be higher than the purity standards for certified soybean and canola seeds set by the Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies ( AOSCA ) , below : <p> Maximum contamination Hybrid corn Soybeans Canola Inert matter 2.00% 2.00% 1.00% Weed seed 0 0.05 25/lb . Other crop seed No standards 0.60 0.25% Other contaminants 0.50 0.50 0.25 <p> SOURCE : Union of Concerned Scientists/AOSCA <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
