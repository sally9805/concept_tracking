<p> WASHINGTON - Since President Bush nominated Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court in October , lawyers and journalists have pored over hundreds of his court decisions and thousands of pages from his work as a Reagan administration lawyer . <p> Activists have spent heavily on TV , radio and Internet ads opposing or supporting Alito to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor . Liberal groups petitioned senators last week to reject the nominee while Christian conservatives backing the judge gathered on Capitol Hill in prayer for him and to consecrate the Hart Senate Office Building room where his confirmation hearings will take place . <p> When Alito enters the room Monday , members of the Senate Judiciary Committee will greet him with promised civility - and a week 's worth of intense questioning . <p> Alito 's confirmation hearings are expected to be much more contentious than those held last fall for Chief Justice John Roberts , in part because more is at stake . <p> Roberts replaced a fellow conservative on the court , the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist . But Alito , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right because he would succeed centrist O'Connor . She has been the court 's most active swing voter , often siding with court liberals to provide the decisive vote on abortion rights , affirmative action , the death penalty and privacy . <p> No one is saying Alito 's nomination is in any trouble . The American Bar Association has given the 55-year-old conservative appeals-court judge its highest rating , " well-qualified . " The committee screening him is composed of 10 Republicans and eight Democrats , and Republicans dominate the full Senate , which will have the final say . <p> With 15 years on the federal bench , Alito is the most experienced judge to be nominated to the high court in decades . Supporters and colleagues praise his intellect , his careful legal reasoning and his allegiance to the law and to Supreme Court precedent . <p> " The portrait that is drawn of him by those who know him and know his writings is of a man of great intelligence , integrity , fairness , humility and justice , " said Wendy Wright of the conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Even Alito 's most strident detractors , including Seth Rosenthal of the liberal group Alliance for Justice , concede he has a brilliant legal mind and is technically well-qualified to do the job . <p> Regardless , Democrats have warned that they might delay a committee vote on Alito 's confirmation or mount a filibuster to block a vote on the Senate floor . Their decision , they said , will depend on how forthcoming the nominee is during the hearings and how well he is able to explain his court rulings and a handful of 20-year-old memos on the volatile issues of abortion rights , voting rights and affirmative action . <p> " Many Democrats , and even some Republicans , and certainly a large number of the American people want to hear his views on these issues , " said committee member Sen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y . " We do n't want to see him duck . " <p> Republicans and Democrats said they intend to grill Alito on those issues as well as on a key question that could quickly come before the high court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war ? <p> The question , prompted in part by Bush 's acknowledgment that he authorized spying on U.S. citizens without obtaining court warrants , is expected to dominate the hearings . <p> " The role of executive power is of enormous importance and consequence in this hearing , " said Sen. Edward Kennedy , D-Mass. , another Judiciary Committee member , and Alito 's record shows he has given a " virtually unlimited green light to authorities . " <p> " The question is : Is there any limit to executive authority and power that this nominee will recognize ? " Kennedy said . <p> Tough questions expected <p> Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter , a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania who supports abortion rights and has expressed outrage over the Bush administration 's spying activities , has warned Alito to expect extensive questioning on those topics . <p> Alito , a Princeton- and Yale-educated lawyer who worked in the Reagan Justice Department before becoming a U.S. attorney in New Jersey and later a judge , has a long paper trail , giving senators plenty to ask about . <p> Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan-era writings , in which he expressed support for chipping away at , and eventually overturning , the Supreme Court 's landmark ruling in " Roe v. Wade " , the 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide . <p> In memos and a 1985 job application for a promotion within the Justice Department , Alito said he was particularly proud of his work on the abortion issue , as well as his efforts to limit affirmative action . <p> Later , as a federal appeals judge on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , Alito said a Pennsylvania abortion law was valid even though it required women seeking abortion to first inform their husbands . He compared the law 's spousal notification to parental notification in cases in which minors seek abortion . The Supreme Court threw out the spousal notification provision , with O'Connor writing that women should not be equated with minors and do not lose their constitutional rights because they marry . <p> Alito will be closely questioned on his Reagan-era writings on executive power , in which he embraced what he called the supremacy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a check on the presidency . <p> Alito urged then-President Reagan to include " signing statements " whenever he signed a bill into law , arguing that the president could use the documents to lay out his interpretation to counter the Congressional Record , which explains Congress ' intentions . <p> Executive power <p> In a 1986 memo , Alito wrote that the attorney general should be immune from prosecution for authorizing illegal wiretaps , a position that likely will draw many questions this week in the context of Bush 's authorization of controversial wiretaps . <p> Since the 1950s , the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution 's balance of powers among the three branches of government should not give way to the president 's commander-in-chief powers , even in wartime . <p> In the most recent case , in which the high court said detainees at a Navy prison camp in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , could challenge their detentions in federal courts , O'Connor wrote that " a state of war is not a blank check for the President . " <p> Another issue could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. Solicitor General 's Office , said his interest in constitutional law was sparked , in part , by his disagreement with the Supreme Court 's decisions on reapportionment , which established the principle of " one person , one vote . " <p> Before those decisions , there was no requirement that every vote counted equally , and many state voting maps were drawn to give ballots cast by voters in one district more weight than voters in other parts of a state . <p> ... <p> A LONG LEGAL HISTORY <p> Judge Samuel Alito has an extensive case record , having served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit since 1990 . A look at some of his more notable cases : <p> Abortion <p> Planned Parenthood v. Casey , 1991 <p> Alito was the lone dissenter in a case that struck down a Pennsylvania law requiring women seeking abortions to notify their spouses . <p> In his dissent , he wrote that he did not believe that requiring notification of a spouse " has been shown to impose an undue burden as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The Supreme Court later upheld the decision striking down the spousal notification portion of the law . <p> Planned Parenthood v. Farmer , 2000 <p> He joined a decision that found a New Jersey law banning late-term abortions unconstitutional . <p> He wrote that a recent decision by the Supreme Court that invalidated a similar law in Nebraska dictated that the New Jersey law also be struck down because it did not include an exception if the mother 's health was in danger . <p> Religion <p> American Civil Liberties Union v. Schundler , 1999 <p> He wrote the majority opinion , which said a holiday display in Jersey City did not violate the establishment of religion clause of the First Amendment because in addition to a Nativity scene and a menorah , it also had a Frosty the Snowman and a banner hailing diversity . <p> He wrote that there was not any " meaningful constitutional distinction " between the Jersey City display and similar displays in Pawtucket , R.I. , in 1984 and in Pittsburgh in 1989 upheld by the Supreme Court . <p> Fraternal Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote the majority opinion , which said that Muslim police officers in Newark could have beards because the department already allowed officers with a skin condition to keep theirs . <p> He wrote that " the medical exemption raises concern because it indicates that the department has made a value judgment that secular ( i.e. , medical ) motivations for wearing a beard are important enough to overcome its general interest in uniformity but that religious motivations are not . " <p> Speech <p> Saxe v. State College Area School District , 2001 <p> He wrote the majority opinion , which struck down a school district 's anti-harrassment policy . <p> " There is also no question that the free speech clause protects a wide variety of speech that listeners may consider deeply offensive , including statements that impugn another 's race or national origin or that denigrate religious beliefs , " he wrote , adding that when laws try to regulate " such topics , however detestable the views expressed may be , we can not turn a blind eye to the First Amendment implications . " <p> Criminal law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority opinion , which ordered a new evidentiary hearing for a black defendant who argued that a juror had made racist remarks after the trial . <p> He wrote that " no rational justification for the exclusion of this testimony was provided by the state courts or the district court , and none has been offered in this appeal . " <p> Federalism <p> United States v. Rybar , 1996 <p> He filed a dissent arguing that Congress overstepped its powers in regulating commerce between states when it passed a federal law banning citizens from owning machine guns . <p> He wrote " we are left with no Congressional findings and no appreciable empirical support for the proposition that the purely intrastate possession of machine guns ... has a substantial effect on interstate commerce " unless the bar for what is a substantial effect is set so low as " to be drained of all practical significance .

" article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my university University of Alaska , Anchorage was one of a minority that has problems with its women 's studies program . We do not even have a major , due to some contending that there would not be enough interest in it . Personally I would love to major in women 's studies to pursue my career as a women 's and family rights attorney , but ... I have to major in political science and minor in women 's studies . It is disgusting to me that the largest public university in the largest state does n't have a women 's studies degree . Taxpayers are funding a closed-minded university , as are all universities that do not encourage these wonderful programs that promote women's-rights awareness and women becoming more involved in the community and political future of our country . - Amber Sawyer Wasilla , AK Editors ' note : Well gee , Amber , maybe you should contact your hometown neighbor , Alaska governor Sarah Palin , and suggest she support a women 's studies major at the university . She 's a feminist , right ? SEXUAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder that we citizens must demand maturity in our government regarding sexual health " Sexual Healing , " Summer 2008 . Let 's get the politics and profit out of our health-care system ! - Lori Slater Cambria , CA IS SEX WORK A " CHOICE " ? I am thankful to see your magazine address prostitution and sex trafficking as feminist issues " Fall Girls , " Summer 2008 . I have another perspective to add . I have a master 's degree in public health from one of the leading schools on the West Coast . I am also a former sex worker . My " choice " to sell sex was financially driven : a divorce , a young son to feed and social services unsympathetic . At the time , I rationalized my choice to sell sex over $5-per-hour factory work , convinced there was nothing wrong with it . However , having left the sex industry and having time to reflect on my experience , I now realize that the excuses I offered myself were delusional . To this day , 10 years later , my feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror , despair and selfloathing . Yet I have utmost respect for all sex workers , especially the women who stood up and spoke at the Deborah Jeane Palfrey trial . That is courage I do not have , and the threat of ruin is very real for me if anyone were to know my past . Prostitution of women exists not because women are willing to sell ; it is because there is a demand for it , men willing to buy , and as the article says they do so with impunity . If men were discouraged from thinking of women as objects for consumption and instead thought of them as human beings , and were taught that buying women is wrong , perhaps prostitution of women would decline , and sex trafficking as well . - Name withheld Editors ' note : For an update on Sen. David Vitter , who went uncensured despite his involvement with Palfrey ( the " D.C. Madam " ) , see page 18 . PRISON VOICES As a feminist and a passionate supporter of Mr. magazine , I want to thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty Brink , Summer 2008 . I am currently incarcerated in Bayview Correctional Facility in New York . I am addressing the very same issues-as are many of the women here-that you mentioned in your article . We receive substandard medical care and unconscionable delays . In fact , recently , one of the ladies who was complaining about receiving inhumane treatment died . Sadly , it was no shock to me . I see a plethora of medical complaints because I work in the Facility Grievance Office . When we formally file these complaints with the administration , we receive the old " No problems here " blanket denial . After reading this article , I know that I am not alone in this fight . I will be released this October and plan to continue the fight against the corrupted health-care system inside women 's prisons . - Jennifer Czosek-Cuoco Bayview Correctional Facility New York , NY My young daughter is currently incarcerated at FMC Carswell and she has reported to me-as much as she can-about the sexual abuses and trauma that go on in that particular prison . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is now 20 and having to live in a place where those who are supposed to be " responsible " for her and for her rehabilitation are , in fact , abusing her far worse than any drug could ever harm her . I feel that by the time she is finally released from this hell known as FMC Carswell she will need more corrective counseling than she ever would have needed just to get off of the drugs . Please keep up the excellent work and maybe some day enough people will care enough to change the currently abusive nature of our own system . - Lorna James By email I am an inmate at Carswell , and your article was dead on . There is so much I 've seen here in just the past four years it would make anyone ill . I 'm making copies and sending them out to family and friends to send to their congress persons . Maybe someone will listen . - Valerie Rasberry Federal Medical Center , Carswell Ft . Worth , TX To me , the most disturbing thing about Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two facts , presented mere paragraphs apart : " Alva Mae ' Granny ' Groves ... having spent 13 years of a 24-year sentence she received for conspiracy to trade crack cocaine for food stamps " and " the prison 's Catholic chaplain ... was sentenced to four years in jail for what the judge called ' surprisingly heinous ' sexual crimes against two imprisoned women . " When a drug charge , even one clearly born of poverty and desperation , carries a 24-year prison sentence but sexual violence ... only a four-year jail term , something is clearly wrong with our penal system . - Jen Nichols Portland , OR While many of us would like to help our sisters in prison , few of us have the courage or the opportunity to do so . One first step is to join us at Action Committee for Women in Prison ( ACWIP ) in our easy pen pal program , which can really make a big difference in a woman in prison 's life ( write penpal@acwip.net for more information ) .

The article . " Pathologizing Your Period " Summer 2008 made PMDD premenstrual dysphoric disorder and its symptoms seem trivial and self-constructed . Although my health is under control now , several years ago I used to become extremely depressed for six to 12 days before my period . I was " normal me " the rest of the month : playful , studious , energized and full of life . Fortunately , my gynecologist helped me construct a life pattern for eating that cuts out foreign hormones and processed foods . This , along with age and time , has lessened my symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal " PMS symptoms , I can definitely affirm that what my gynecologist recognized as PMDD is much different than PMS . While such disorders as PMDD may be misunderstood and overdiagnosed , it does not mean they 're nonexistent and that the sufferers should " look at what 's really behind their feelings . " - Rachel E. McCready Ann Arbor , MI Thank you for the delightfully informative article by Paula Caplan on pathologizing premenstrual symptoms . I have experienced premenstrual symptoms to one degree or another for a couple of decades . I can attest to experiencing strong mood fluctuations , cramping , bloating ... essentially the works . I have learned to reduce bloating and cramping by drinking more water and cutting out or reducing soda intake . Likewise , a couple of ibuprofen easily temper physical discomfort . Mood swings are more complicated , yet seen from a certain perspective they can also serve as a tool . Going through life with a stable mood is overrated ; mood fluctuations can shift or alter consciousness in a positive way . It seems that the premenstrual state magnifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face ourselves with more authenticity .

Wattles Los Altos Hills , CA INSPIRED BY GAY MARRIAGE The photo of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyons in " Milestones " Summer 2008 inspires me to make my marriage healthy and happy . People who are afraid of same-sex marriage are probably reluctant to address issues of injustice . Well , no kidding , it can be hard to talk about these things ! Your magazine shows us how , with an honesty and compassion that feels like a breath of fresh air ( and , sometimes , like a punch in the gut ) . For what it 's worth , I 'm a heterosexual man .

In Martha Burk 's article " Your Money , Your Vote " Spring 2008 , she says : " And women are more likely to leave their jobs because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse or to take care of their families . None of these reasons for job loss are covered by unemployment insurance . " In fact , California pioneered in this area years ago , passing California Unemployment Insurance Code sections 1030 and 1256 . Both cover domestic violence ( toward children or oneself ) as a basis for good cause for leaving work and collecting unemployment . I believe other states have followed this lead as well . - Nancy K. D.

In addition to California , 22 other states cover domestic violence , and still more have legislation pending . POLYGAMY AND RACISM Thank you for Andrea Moore-Emmett 's article on the FLDS polygamy abuse " Behind the Cloak of Polygamy , " Summer 2008 . So far her article is only the second one I 've found that mentions the white supremacy that cult leader Warren Jeffs preaches . The Southern Poverty Law Center quotes Warren Jeffs : " The black race is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring evil unto the earth , " and " If you marry a person who has connections with a Negro , you would become cursed . " Thank you for printing an article that exposes a piece of the widespread connection between religion-gone-wrong and racism . - Kali Kaliche Williams , AZ As someone who has closely followed news of the FLDS mothers and children , I read with interest your piece " Behind the Cloak of Polygamy . " I agree that treatment of women and children at the Yearning for Zion Ranch is a feminist issue , but so is the treatment of these same women and children by Texas authorities . As a feminist and a mother , I agonized to see women were stripped of their rights to breastfeed their babies and visit their children . I was stunned to see them have to fight for the most basic due process . If the patriarchy is as bad as the author of the article claims it is , by all means prosecute the FLDS men for their crimes . But arriving at the ranch with tanks and guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no way to bring about justice . The Texas Supreme Court correctly noted this , and a feminist magazine like Mr. should , too . - Dorian Solot Albany , NY Editors ' note : The Texas Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling that the state had n't presented enough evidence of imminent danger to justify removing the children . Currently , Texas child-welfare authorities are examining 205 individual cases to see whether children from the Yearning for Zion Ranch have been abused or are at risk .

There has been an agreement among those who are working toward improving women 's lives that the focus needs to be on women through providing them with education , giving them reproductive options and other health-care treatment , making microloans to them and giving them highly nutritious food to keep their many children alive . What is never addressed is , What the hell are their men thinking ? Is men 's sexuality so sacrosanct that we 'll never challenge them when they impregnate the same woman until she has 15 children ? Will we never have programs where boys and men are encouraged to develop some empathy for the women in their lives or to take responsibility for their own sexual behavior ? - Jo Nol West Simsbury , CT ADDRESS ALL CORRESPONDENCE TO Letters to the Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hills , CA 90212 EMAIL **33;87;TOOLONG Please include your name , address , email and phone number on all correspondence .
