Chapter One JUNE . A SAVANNAH JUNE . H0T . Lush . Rich . Damp , like a satisfied woman . Even in this place of unreality where the trio held court , that fact could not be denied . It was an odd assemblage they made , yet commonplace , at least here at Cedar Grove , where fractured minds were prodded and patched . One walked tall , cloaked in a posture of importance , willowy flame red hair brushing swaying shoulders . The other , a birch brown and catlike in grace , appeared cover-girl stylish , pushing the third , silent bronze-toned beauty in a wheelchair . Yet the trio appeared to move almost seamlessly across the lush green grounds of the Savannah , Georgia , facility-embraced by rose bushes , towering magnolia trees , and jasmine vines-wrapped up , it seemed , in the tranquillity of their surroundings . In truth , that was a lie . A closer look revealed two pairs of eyes , one brown set , one green , both intent and serious , their dual voices barely carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the third who was their concern , the focus of their hushed conversation . From time to time , they ceased speaking to look mournfully upon Rayne Holland as she sat motionless in the chair , her gaze fixed and unseeing . So they believed . I know why I 'm here , Rayne thought , listening to her doctor and her best friend discuss her " illness " as if she were invisible . They think I 'm crazy because I cut my wrists , because I wo n't talk . I do n't talk because they ca n't hear me . They wo n't hear me , they never have . I 'm just tired , that 's all . Tired of all the talk , the emptiness , the betrayals by people who claim to love you . That does n't make me crazy , just fed up , she concluded , beginning to unfasten the buttons of her pale peach cotton blouse , the tiny white buttons taunting her nut brown fingers with slippery elusiveness . She knew Dr. Dennis would stop her , because for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've discussed this , Rayne , " Pauline Dennis said , speaking with a calmness that chilled Rayne , stilling her shaky fingers . " Button your blouse , Rayne . " Rayne released a long , deep sigh , heavy enough to drop to the ground , hitting it like a rubber ball and bouncing back into her chest , until next time . She did what she was told , as she 'd always done . Periodically , as the trio meandered down the paved pathways that ran the circumference of Cedar Grove Medical Center , Gayle Davis , Rayne 's lifelong friend , would stroke Rayne 's mane of black , crinkly hair with a slender brown hand , almost as you would a pet or a small child who 'd wandered into your space in the midst of an adult conversation . Absently . Rayne hated when Gayle did that . Hated it . It infuriated her so much that she 'd almost shouted the words : Stop it , dammit ! I 'm not that stinking cat of yours , or your neglected daughter . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express her feelings , the emotions that swirled within her . So instead , she screamed the words-in her head-where they bounced around , echoing over and over : Stop , stop , stop ... Inside her head was as far as she could go these days-most days , actually . Lately , though , she 'd wanted to crawl out , back into the world again . But thought better of it . It was safer just where she was . She gathered her hair in her hands and dragged it in front of her makeupless face , effectively escaping . " Why does she do that ? " Gayle whispered harshly , moving to brush the hair out of Rayne 's face . Dr. Dennis stopped her . " Fix your hair , Rayne , " she instructed in a cool monotone . Rayne emitted another baleful sigh and did as she was told . " These are all manifestations of Rayne 's trauma , Mrs. Davis , her unspoken need to hide , to disappear , get away from whatever is haunting her . They 'll slowly stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gayle shuddered despite the warmth . " What is her problem ? It 's been two months , Dr. Dennis , " she complained , her voice taking on that clipped tone that often grated on Rayne 's nerves . Rayne never told her about that , either . " I do n't see any improvement . " She adjusted her fitted gray linen jacket over her round hips . " Paul and Desi have been gone for almost six months . She was coming to terms with it . And then ... this . You came highly recommended-as the best . " Gayle 's voice hitched a notch as if she no longer believed in the laundry list of recommendations attached to Dr. Pauline Dennis 's name , Rayne mused , as Gayle patted her head again and continued to push the chair . Stop , stop , stop ... Pauline nodded in doctorlike agreement . " I appreciate your concerns , Mrs. Davis . But you must understand that recovery from a mental breakdown is not like a broken limb where the doctors can give you a timetable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite sure what triggered Rayne 's break . She wo n't talk . I do believe , however , that Rayne 's problem dates prior to the deaths of her husband and daughter . Something that was never dealt with . The car accident was only a trigger for her suicide attempt at her father 's house . " Gayle stopped short , jerking the chair to a halt . " I 've known Rayne almost all my life , Doctor . If there had been some ... some underlying problem , something wrong , I would have known . She 's always been well adjusted , hardworking . Everyone loves Rayne . You 've got to do something to help her . We 're closer than most sisters . " We were until I found out you were sleeping with my husband , Rayne reflected absently . But it does n't matter much now-since Paul 's dead . She blinked and her thoughts snapped to other things , their voices fading into the scenery . What was worse than being patted on the head ? Rayne wondered . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought , and heard her laughter as the realization chimed in her head . They think I do n't hear , I do n't feel , do n't think . It 's not true . It is n't . I write it all down in my journal , every night when everyone is asleep and the nurses are busy skulking in the corners with the doctors ... whispering , always whispering . Giggles ... sometimes . The soothing tones of Dr. Dennis drifted to her , scattering her disjointed thoughts . " Unfortunately , in cases like these we usually discover that the patient , over time , has developed the ability to function quite normally in society , developing a barrier against the world to hinder discovery of what is truly going on with them or often to protect themselves emotionally from further harm . " Much as I have done , Dr. Dennis thought as she gazed across the landscape of the mentally ill . " I just do n't understand it . If something had been going on in Rayne 's life , some secret or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would . " She breathed heavily . " Has her father been here to see her ? " Gayle asked as they rounded another curve . Rayne sighed again . Pauline stuck her hands into the pockets of her starched white smock , so stiff it barely moved . " No . He 's called several times to check on her progress . " They came to the end of the path , the wrought-iron gates , like swirling black storm clouds , the cutoff point for insanity . Gayle turned to Pauline , the honey brown of her eyes shimmering in the sunlight . " Please , Dr. Dennis , whatever you need to do to make Rayne better , just do it . You do n't know the Rayne that I know , that the world was beginning to know . She 's a wonderful , caring person with a brilliant filmmaking career ahead of her . " Her voice faltered momentarily with emotion , like the sound of a stereo losing an instant of power . Emotion , real or imagined-Rayne could n't tell . " Please help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance cue from the watery look in Gayle 's eyes , placed a gentle hand on her shoulder . " We 're going to do everything we can for Rayne , believe me . Time and patience are the great healers , " she said , the line memorized from more than a decade of practiced repetition . " Give Rayne that , " she added , the solemnity of her tone calming the jangles in Gayle 's stomach . Rayne almost believed the words . Time and patience . Almost . Gayle blew out a breath , her bangs responding with a slight flutter . " I suppose none of us have a choice , " she said . She came around to the front of the chair and bent down , placing her newly manicured hands on each side of Rayne 's face . " Rayne , honey , it 's me , Gayle . Just say something , Rayne . Let me know you hear me . " You hurt me , Gayle , she screamed in her head . You were supposed to be my friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you used them to screw my husband . You bitch . Did you hear that ? " We all love you , Rayne , and want you to get better . Your goddaughter , Tracy , misses you terribly . " I had a daughter once , Rayne recalled . Her name was Desiree . My baby . She loved me . But she 's gone , too . As Gayle leaned forward to kiss Rayne 's cheek , she frantically raked her fingers through her hair from the nape of her neck , bringing the thick bush forward to shut out Gayle 's face . But not before that instant of clarity beamed in her eyes . That instant of pure hatred and pain that reached down with cold fingers deep into Gayle 's soul and squeezed , sending shockwaves of ice coursing through her veins . Gayle shuddered , rocking back on her haunches . A feeling of physical violation permeated her . On shaky limbs she stood , forcing a smile . " Fix your hair , Rayne , " Pauline instructed . Rayne did as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... next week , " Gayle muttered . " If you need anything , you have my number . " Pauline studied her for a moment . " Are you all right ? " " Yes , fine . " She wanted to run . " I 've got to go . " She turned and hurried down the last few yards toward escape . Pauline gripped the handles of the chair , turned it around , and headed back toward the facility . " Gayle 's a good friend , Rayne , " she said in that cool voice . " She loves you a great deal . And she 's very worried about you . " Rayne sighed heavily . Pauline learned from the weeks of working with Rayne that her sighs were an indication that she was tuning out a comment or situation . It was the only outward sign that she understood , or had any feelings about what was going on around her . At least it was a start . Although this case was difficult , Pauline was intrigued by Rayne Holland , intrigued in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew Rayne heard and understood , was aware of the world . Why would n't she speak ? What had so traumatized her that she 'd rather be silent , shrink into a tiny dark corner of her mind to hide ? From what ? Who ? There was something about Rayne , a familiarity of spirit that drew Pauline to her , a part of her that understood the torment and fear . It was as if they were joined in some intangible way . Pauline shrugged off her moment of frustration and continued down the path , even as her resolve to uncover what lay beneath Rayne 's veil of self-protection grew . By degrees the natural light , the sounds of nature , the scent of flora and sweet rich earth began to diminish to a trickle , like a hose almost shut off but not quite . If Rayne squeezed her eyes shut and thought really hard , she could hold on to her piece of serenity for a few moments more . A few moments before the baby blue walls and the rustling of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine carts and food trays , the irritating sounds of Muzak pumped in from some unseen source and the cloying scent of disinfectant-a few moments before they overwhelmed her with the weight of their existence . The moment was gone . " I 'll see you tomorrow , Rayne , for our regular session , " Pauline said , pushing the chair back into Rayne 's private room . Her haven . Her room was located on the sixth floor of the facility-as it was called-a corner room that overlooked the garden below . Spacious , and painted in a soft peach-her favorite color-the perimeters at the top and bottom of the smooth wails were covered in a riotous fabric of bursting flowers that matched the short curtains , camouflaging the protective mesh that pressed erotically against the window . In the morning , when the sun first rose above the trees , the light filtered through the mesh , casting shadows of boxes and diamonds across the walls . Sometimes Rayne would imagine that they were small , secret passageways . Passageways to freedom . An oversized chintz chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood floor . There was nothing in the room that was personal . No photos or mementos from her life . It was almost as if Rayne Holland 's existence began when she entered Cedar Grove . But of course that was not true . She had a life , or at least she thought she did , until it came apart . Rayne moved languorously across the room toward the window where a row of potted plants sat on the sill . Picking up the water jug , she meticulously watered each one . Pauline watched , her hands hidden in the deep patch pockets of her smock . Sighing , she turned and quietly closed the door behind her . Rayne heard the click of the metal against metal . She lowered her head . I know you 're trying to help , Dr. Dennis , she thought , looking up to stare out across the sea of green below . I want you to help . I want to feel again , rise above the dark clouds that push me down , smothering me in nothingness . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BACK TO THE center of Savannah took less than twenty minutes . To Gayle it felt like forever . Each visit to Rayne depleted her in ways she could never explain or understand . Some days it took all she had to walk through those gates , face her friend , and see her ... that way . Oh , God . Her throat burned and tightened , her eyes filled as she drew closer to her home . They 'd been so close once , sharing everything , Gayle reminisced , a sad smile shadowing her coral-tinted lips . They 'd met in fifth grade in Ms. Hubert 's English class . They were both ten years old . Gayle hated English . Rayne was the brightest one in the class . Outside of class she was so quiet , hardly said a word to anyone . But there was something about Rayne that drew Gayle . Everyone said Rayne Mercer was weird , at least when she was younger . Gayle did n't think so . She just needed a friend . One day at lunch in the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cafeteria was in a state of bedlam with the student body of three hundred making good use of their free time . The cacophony of raised voices , banging , slamming utensils and trays competed for superiority . Yet Rayne seemed oblivious to it all as she nibbled on her peanut butter and jelly sandwich and sipped her milk right from the carton , peering sporadically over its red-and-white top to the sea of faces that swirled around her .
