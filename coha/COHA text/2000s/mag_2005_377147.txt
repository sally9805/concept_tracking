Maybe all the Pol Pot costumes were taken . It 's hard to imagine what made dressing up as a Nazi seem like a good idea to PRINCE HARRY , 20 , who appalled Britons by wearing a swastika armband to a party this month . Though the young royal issued a statement saying " It was a poor choice of a costume , and I apologize , " Jewish groups called for him to show more contrition and attend a ceremony at Auschwitz on Jan. 27 . This is n't the first time Harry 's blunders have embarrassed the royal family . Last fall he socked a photographer outside a club ; in 2002 he got caught smoking pot . Maybe , like the Prince Hal in Shakespeare 's Henry IV , he 's just setting himself up for a dramatic last-minute reformation . But then who will make Prince William look good ?
