Richard Mueller published about a dozen stories in our pages in the 1980s , then let other creative endeavors take him away from writing fiction . Recently he got bitten again by the short-story bug and we 've been pleased to bring you results such as " Jew if by Sea " and " I Am the City . " His new one is a heartfelt tale of life on the rails . <p> I FIRST MET DUTCH BACK in " 73 . I 'd just gotten back from Vietnam and had managed to get into the Burlington Northern 's engineer training program - though it was just the Burlington then , the C.B. &.Q.; I 'd ridden the train into Chicago with a letter from my Uncle Walter , my discharge papers , my hopes high and , wonder of wonders , I got a job on the first try . Not that I was a complete novice . I 'd jockied yard goats and shorthaul switchers in the Explosive Loading section in Saigon , running ammunition up the coast as far as Nha Tran , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops on the line . As it became clear that we were losing , that the heart had gone out of the South Vietnamese cause , I 'd worked closer and closer to Saigon . I had shuttled boxcars and coaches to where they were needed until the collapse , when our unit was disbanded and assigned to an Engineer Battalion , ripping up tracks and wrecking rolling stock . Finally , we boarded an LST for Guam and home and mustering out . So I brought military railroad experience to the job , and that , coupled with the letter from Uncle Walter ( who had hogged Prairies and Mikes during the " 4Os and " 5Os ) , landed me one of the few trainee jobs available . By 1978 I was pushing a peddler freight down to Galesburg and back and it was there , in the Galesburg Yard on a cold and windy morning in March , that I first met Dutch . He looked to be my age , about thirty , lean and road-tough , dressed for hard travel . he was wearing jeans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a good army pack over his shoulder . he was standing by the track , watching my Geep grind toward him , just as if it were the town bus and he was heading off to the first shift at the Caterpillar plant . I had to smile . he looked like he thought I was going to pick him up , but I was getting ready to accelerate . I had a yellow light . The moment it went green , I 'd notch her up and be headed back to Chicago , a string of empties and loaners behind me . Back in the crummy , my fireman was drinking coffee and I was looking forward to a milk run and then the light changed to red . I cut my speed , touched the brakes , and we drifted to a stop . I looked down at the tall , angular stranger by the tracks . I know now what moved Dutch , what drove him on mile after mile , year after year ; how powerful and terrible and irresistible that compulsion was . How it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It was a force of nature , and at that moment it wrapped itself around me and pried open my preconceptions . I understood the man standing by the tracks , felt his need and urgency , felt his connection to the great diesel , its wheels standing on steel ribbons leading everywhere . I knew the air , the wind and cold , the towns and cities and the immense spaces between . And the fragility of it all . I could not turn away from this man . " Where ya headed ? " I asked . He smiled , his shoulders hunched against the cold . " East , " he said . " Chicago right now . " " Come on up . " He climbed easily into the cab , pulled down the jump seat , and settled himself . After a moment the light turned green and we were off to Chicago . I did n't learn much about him that day . he called himself Dutch , he was from California , he rode the trains a lot , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good listener and did n't like to talk much . His clothes were patched but clean . His hair and beard were neatly trimmed . I let him off at the west end of Chicago Hump. he waved goodbye and headed out to catch a train for the east . I figured I 'd never see Dutch again , but three months later , as I pulled out of Aurora in the same Geep , heading west , I saw him step off a Burlington commuter train . he waved to the conductor and started across the tracks toward my engine . " Dutch , I did n't know you rode passenger trains . " " Sometimes , " he said with a smile . I waved him up and he settled onto the jumpseat . " Headin'west ? " " Headin'west . " He said maybe six words on the rest of the run and then I dropped him off in Galesburg so he could connect with a westbound rattler . After I did my turnaround , I went down to the beanery for a hot turkey sandwich and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man named Rufe Carillo , came in and slid into my booth . " I seed you drop off Dutch , " he rumbled , signaling the waitress for coffee . I looked hard at Carillo . " You gon na write me up , Rufe ? " Rufe sipped his coffee . " You know it 's against the rules , and if it was anyone but Dutch I 'd generate some paper on ya .... " Rufe loved to generate paper . he stared at me . " Whaddaya make a that guy ? " Coffee became pie and ice cream and a cigar and the air conditioning pumped away , with the weather outside all cicadas and heat shimmering above the rails . Fishing weather . I did n't know what to say about Dutch and I told Rufe so . " Well , nobody does . He 's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside a enigma . " I laughed . " You just make that up ? " " Naw , I heard it on TV. " he sipped his coffee . " According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read more books . " I pushed back my plate . " What do you know about him , Rufe ? " Rufe frowned . he probably wanted me to call him " Mr. Carillo . " " About what everybody else knows , " he said at last . " Squat . Hey , there 's a project for ya , kid . You got yer G.I. Bill . Go to school and get a education before one a them damn diesels shakes your liver loose or cuts off your foot . Take psychology classes and maybe you can figure out what makes ole Dutch tick . " Instead I began asking the other engineers about Dutch and building up a file of popular misconceptions about who the man was . Holy Joe Gordon , who drove on the Minneapolis run , insisted that Dutch was a fallen angel , thrown down upon the Earth to test Lucifer 's greed . just how this would test Lucifer 's greed he could not say , but Holy Joe was certain that he was privy to God 's cosmic plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.D . that Dutch was a diamond smuggler and always had a fortune in gems in his pocket . Another thought he was working for the FBI , looking for sabotage on the railroads . A fireman up in Savannah claimed that Dutch was a spirit sent to herald the second coming of Christ but that he 'd lost his way and was riding the trains to find his way back to the correct spiritual path . Engineers picked him up because it was a holy act . I heard a lot of that sort of talk . There seemed to be quite a bit of religion riding the rails and working the trains back in the " 80s . Maybe it had something to do with Reagan . Of course , there were the profane suggestions too . A waitress at the hotcake House in Knoxville said that Dutch was running away from wives in eight states . A yard man said that he was fleeing a series of paternity suits . That he 'd killed a man in Texas , in Alaska , in Wisconsin , two men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and among railway men he soon assumed the status of the Phantom Hitchhiker . Everyone claimed to have seen him , most hoggers still picked him up , and I never heard anyone say a bad word about his manners or his conduct . Dutch charmed everyone he met , though there was a tragic aura about him , a feeling that he was a survivor of some terrible disaster . Many men become enamored of the rails , fall in love with the sounds of a train in the night and go back again and again ; but with Dutch it was like he was a part of the system , throbbing in the steel like those electrical pulses that activate the signals . Like an engine he could not leave the ribbons of steel but was condemned to ride on them forever . After that I did n't see Dutch for a few years , though he passed back and forth on the Burlington more than once . The Burlington became the Burlington Northern and soon I was pushing long-haul freights through the Big Sky Country . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses at the U. I had pretty much forgotten about Dutch . Then one night at the University Library I ran into a face I had n't seen in a while . " Rufe ? " I was not surprised that Ruf us Carillo was older and heavier and grayer - but I did n't expect to find him in Minneapolis in a library . " Hey , hey , hogger. " he grasped my hand in a bone-crunching grip . " So you did go to college . " " And you decided to read more books . " " Yeah , " he said , " but that 's not why I 'm here tonight . I 'm picking up my grandson . I 's retired now an livin " in Minneapolis with my daughter and son-in-law . Come down the Model Railroad Club some Wednesday night and we 'll chew the fat . " " Ca n't get away from the trains , huh ? " " Never . They 're in ma blood . " he looked around for his grandson , who was late , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around for years . " CHILD KILLED IN RR MISHAP Thomas Lamson , 5 , was killed Saturday afternoon when he was struck by a train in the Santa Fe yards in City of Industry . His mother , Elizabeth Lamson , 23 , and her boyfriend Robert Jenkins , 26 , had taken the boy trainwatching and , during a moment of inattention , the boy had slipped away . Jenkins and Lamson were searching for her son when he was struck and killed by an arriving train . The death was ruled to be an accident and no charges were filed . . " Where 'd you get this , Rufe ? " Rufe sighed . " One night about four years ago Dutch came in on the dog . It was late , I was going off shift and I told him that he could come home and sleep in our spare room . Mrs. Carillo was alive then and she liked it when I brought the guys home to share her cooking . " Well , Dutch shipped out in the morning and later the Mrs. found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I been meaning to get it back to him but I di n't get a chance before I retired . Maybe you 'll see him . " I thought about that a lot over the next six months as I pushed my freights back and forth to Whitefish but I never saw Dutch . In fact , I did n't see him again for another two years . I 'd been fishing up north near Silver Bay and on the way back I stopped in Duquette to eat lunch in a diner by the GB &W; tracks . As I got out of my truck , a red and white Green Bay road switcher was pulling into town with a cut of empty centerbeam flats , and I saw a familiar figure swing down from the cab . I watched as he walked toward the diner , his pack over his shoulder , looking for all the world like a local just dropping in for a bite . Then , remembering the clipping in my wallet , I followed him in . Dutch was sitting in a booth by the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buy yalunch , pal ? " . ' .. He broke into a broad smile . " Red . You working on the Green Bay these days ? " " No , I 'm still with the Burly-Q . I 've been up north , fishing . " We ordered and Dutch asked me about the fish , my health , my family , Minneapolis , almost anything but trains , but I guess he saw enough of them . he was delighted to hear I was taking courses at U. Minn . " What in ? " " I guess you 'd call it a dual major . History and journalism . " Dutch nodded and sipped his coffee . " So what have you been doing ? " I asked . He laughed . " What I always do . I ride the trains . I work some . " " I wanted to ask you about that , Dutch , " I said . " Where do you get your money ? " He looked at me as if I had just committed an act of unexpected rudeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewed his lip . " I tole ya , Red . I work some . " " Come on , Bob , " I said . " You can do better than that . " He stared at me with an expression of desolation that said his deepest secret had been uncovered , and worse , uncovered by a friend . As if Dutch could really be said to have any friends . " Bob ? " he said , softly . " Robert Jenkins , right ? " He glanced out the window at the diesel idling across the highway , then at the crewmen eating in the far booth . " Where 'd you hear that ? " I pushed the clipping across the table . " Rufe Carillo thought you might want this back . " " How is Rufe ? " " He 's good . Retired , living in Minneapolis with his kids andgrandkids . " " Good old Rufe , " he muttered , folding the clipping carefully and slipping it into his shirt pocket . he did n't look at it . he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rails , Dutch ? No charges were filed . What the hell happened ? " I set down a twenty to cover lunch . " Let 's walk . " We crossed the highway and walked along the rails , heading toward the yard limit sign on the east edge of town . " Why do you want to know ? " I shrugged . " Because I 'm curious . Because of the history , I guess . " I tried unsuccessfully to keep the anger out of my voice as I added , " Maybe because I think you 're getting a raw deal . " His laugh was harsh and brittle . " If I am , it 's my deal . I dealt the hand . I 'll play it out , " he said . " Yeah ? Well , that does n't make it right . just stupid . " " I ca n't fault ya there , " he replied . " Christ , Dutch , it 's been twenty-five years . The state would have paroled you in eight . Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost him . I thought he 'd turn away , leave and cut whatever tenuous string still bound us together , but Dutch was also tied to the rails with mighty cables . Duquette had only the one rail line , and on that line only one train ran . Completely by chance I 'd cornered him , and the habits of charming defeat , of stiff surrender and polished politeness that he had carefully constructed over the years would not allow him to fight me . " Why do you have to know ? " he said at last . " Why do you care ? " " Because I think it 's time for you to let it out . " He snorted . " You takin " psychology courses too ? " " Dutch , I 've had three wives . I 've got a kid and miles of track behind me , and at fifty-two I 'm lost in my own damned future . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " I do n't know , " I said honestly , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of a flatcar , the late April sun falling across us in long ragged strips , patterns cut from the holes in the centerbeam running down the length of the car . Nearby , on the ground , a dozen sparrows were reducing a pile of spilled grain . Dutch looked at them for a long time and said nothing . Then he turned to me and nodded . " All right , Red . Maybe it 's time . " " I GREW UP IN Los Angeles , in the Fairfax District . I went to Hollywood High School with a bunch of kids who were destined to be minor actors , little stars in the firmament no one would remember . Nobody famous , just working actors . " I liked all that stuff and when I graduated , a guy I knew who was a few years older got me into the Stage Electrician 's Guild as an apprentice . It was a good job and I made some nice money . After my folks were killed in a car accident when I was twenty-two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little house and a car and lots of work on soaps and game shows . I read and I had some hobbies but I was lonely . I did n't have a lot of friends and I spent most of my time by myself . Then I met Elizabeth . " I used to go up to the band shell in Griffith Park to read and sketch and listen to the L.A. Philharmonic rehearse . Elizabeth was a fill-in violinist , an understudy who covered for the third and fourth chairs , so she was always there . Sometimes she played and sometimes she watched , and finally one day she sat down and asked me what I was doing . Well , what I was doing was sketching . I used to draw pictures of the musicians , of the scenery , of things in my head . On that day I had drawn a picture of her . She liked it so I gave it to her . " The next time I came to watch a rehearsal , she was playing . I watched and waited until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I wanted to go out for coffee . " I do n't know how these things start , but ours began because neither of us had anyone to talk to . We lived about thirty miles apart - L.A. is big ; dozens of towns connected by freeways but we visited and started going to movies and dinners . And we fell in love . We talked about moving in together and living as a couple , though she was dead set against marriage . " Fool me once " was one of her favorite expressions . She had her music and her job and her son . Things were good for a time - but I guess things change . You think it 's gon na go on forever and you 're gon na see the same face every morning for the rest of your life and you forget that it can all go away in an instant . But you know about that , do n't you ? I mean , you 've been married three times . " Well , it happened on a late spring day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked me and he loved trains so we used to go trainwatching on Sundays . There was a spot by the Santa Fe yards where we could put down a blanket and eat a picnic lunch and watch the trains go in and out of the yard . " Tommy knew never to go off the grass onto the gravel and cinders where the tracks were . On that day he was playing , and Elizabeth and I were talking about being in love and getting a house and moving in together . I tell ya , Red , it was the last peaceful moment of my life . " She looked up , like an animal does when it senses danger , and said , " Where 's Tommy ? " because suddenly he was nowhere in sight . Kids do that , but I did n't know enough about kids to expect it . He was just a good kid , and I loved him because I loved his mother . " We ran into the yard , looking for him , and when I found him he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the ground was shaking and I could hear the train bearing down upon us . Tommy was watching it approach , a huge , fast , perishable drag , balling hard through on the main , with the engineer hanging on the horn . I guess he was hoping that it would scare Tommy away - but it did n't . " I started to run , leaping over the intervening tracks to get to him and then I .. .1 faltered . It was as if I knew that even if I got there in time to save him my momentum would carry us both into the train . But I did n't know that . I did n't understand anything . I just stopped ten feet short and the train went by , brakes screaming - and for a second Tommy was okay . I looked into his face and he smiled at me , then he put his hand back as if he was trying to touch the train and it took him . There was that second , and then he was gone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something older than trains or men , and that 's when I heard Elizabeth screaming . She 'd seen the whole thing : the train , Tommy , and me stopped short of saving him . " The police came and all through it we sat side by side answering questions . She never cried and she never looked at me . But when it was over she said , " You could have saved him/then she got up and walked awav . " I glanced at Dutch but he was looking off to the east , toward Michigan ; toward something no one else could see . I could think of nothing to say , so I put a hand on his shoulder . It felt cold . Finally he spoke . " I went home that night and realized that I had lost everything , thrown it away through cowardice , or a lack of faith , or something I could not name or understand . And I decided that I could not live that way . " " So you went to the rails , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not to ride . I drove down to the mainline in Burbank , parked my car and walked over to the tracks . And I waited . A lot of fast trains come through there and I fully intended to step in front of the first one . Thirty , forty minutes passed and I waited , listening to the night noises . Then a light appeared , coming around the bend , and I felt a sudden peace . I knew that I could not change anything that had happened but I could redeem my own debt , cancel out the pain I was carrying , now and forever . " " What happened ? " Dutch smiled , almost wistfully . " We do n't get many thunder storms in southern California . The sky was cloudy , but I had n't heard any rumbling . Then a bolt of lightning came down and hit the Alien Avenue signal bridge . There was this flash and I felt this pain in my chest , and I was out . When I came to , all of the signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me drifted down to a stop until the cab of the lead unit was right in front of me . The engineer looked down at me and said something I do n't remember , and I said something , and then I was climbing up into the cab . By morning I was in Reno and after a time I became Dutch . " " You chose the name , " I said . " Yes . " " After the Flying Dutchman . " " Yes . " He looked at me and ran his hand along the sill of the flatcar . " After , I found that I could not leave . Every time I tried I had to come back because the pain drew me . You know the story , the legend . " " Yes , " I said . " The sailor could only be redeemed by the love of a pure woman . " " And the only pure woman I ever knew .... " He did n't complete the thought . He did n't have to . But I had to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know , " he said . For the first time I knew that he was lying . And by his demeanor I understood that our conversation was over . He pushed himself off the car and landed nimbly on his feet . The sparrows scattered . The train crew were coming out of the diner . I climbed down . " Dutch . " " Ummmm . " " Thanks for telling me the story . I 've been wanting to know for a long time . " He barked out a short , bitter laugh . " The past is the past , " he said . As we walked toward the engine , I fished a card out of my pocket . " Here . If you come through Minneapolis , call me . " He said he would . Then he climbed up , waved once , and was off to the west . Two years later I retired . I hung up my watch and started a minor career in journalism . Two months after that , on a rainy April night while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theatre , my phone rang . It was Dutch . I met him at the freight yards and brought him home . He walked around my little house , looking at my sparse , neat surroundings ; my books , my office , the framed Charlie Lewis railroad prints in the study . " This is nice , " he said at last . " Someday I 'd like to have a place like this . You 've done well . " " I 'm making a living , " I said , pushing the point a bit . " And you , Dutchman . Ever think about giving up the silver steel seas ? " He smiled . " Very poetic . I 'll bet you 're a pretty good journalist . " " I do all right , " I said , but I was n't going to let him off the hook . " Well , Dutch ? Are you ever going to give up riding the trains ? You 're getting older , and they 're getting more dangerous . " It was true . With containers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride on the freights and a lot of the older engineers Dutch knew well were retiring . The younger guys were n't nearly as sympathetic ; he 'd have to wait longer between rides . " You know I ca n't leave , Red , " he said at last , the age lines deepening in his face . Dutch looked like he belonged in my old stuffed chair , my Burlington coffee mug in his mitt , but he was a coiled spring , waiting to be released . He sighed . " If I stay away more than a day my chest starts to ache where the lightning hit me . Thirty-six hours and I 'm a wreck , so I stay close to the trains . " We sat for a while and I saw his body slowly relax . I had the radio on ; soft music , Chopin I think . Elizabeth Lamson was a concert violinist . I wondered if Dutch listened to classical music and thought of her . I hated to break the mood , but there was no telling when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and withdrew a cloth-covered scrapbook . " What 's this ? " " It 's everything I could find on Elizabeth . And you . " " Me ? " " Yeah . Most of it 's articles on Elizabeth Lamson . She 's first chair now , but I think you know that . " He nodded . " Yeah , I know it . " " And there are five articles on you , three of them by me . You 're human interest , Bob . " " Not to me , I 'm not . " I was silent for a moment . I was about to lower the hammer and I did n't feel good about it , but it had to be done . " I sent copies of my columns to Ms. Lamson , care of the L.A. Phil . She wrote me a letter . I think you should have it . " Dutch appeared to be in shock . I knew that reaction . There are those moments when the hit to your brain and heart are so heavy that you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's waiting for everything just to go away , like that thousand-yard-stare shell shock that combat soldiers get . I unfolded my reading glasses and put them on , then pulled the letter out of my pocket and opened it . I thought that Dutch might say something or try to stop me but he sat there like a pale gray shadow , staring at his hands . Dear Mr. Corcoran , Thank you for sending me your articles about Rob . Since you knew to contact me I presume that you know some of our story so I wo n't comment on it here . I 've often thought of Rob and wondered how he was , what he was doing , if he were all right . He disappeared the day after the death of my son and I never heard from him again . I 'm going to send a letter to Rob in care of you in Minneapolis . If you see him again , please pass it along . And thank you for your concern . If you 're ever in Los Angeles come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Elizabeth Lamson Dutch looked at me . I nodded and passed him the second letter , still sealed . He looked at it , at her handwriting on the envelope , then folded his hands around it . " Thanks , " he said softly . " I 'm heading up to bed , " I said . " Use the spare room . I 'll see you in the morning . At the foot of the stairs I glanced back and he was still sitting there , staring at the envelope . When I came down in the morning he was gone . I did n't think I 'd ever see or hear from Dutch again but , a year and a half later in the spring , my doorbell rang . At first I did not recognize the man standing on my porch . His hair was neatly trimmed and he was clean-shaven . He wore a light gray , summer-weight suit and a tie . I gaped , he smiled . " Dutch ? " " Hi , Red , " he said . His smile broadened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come at a bad time ? " " No , not at all , " I said , ushering him in . I noticed that he had no backpack . " I 'd be willing to bet you did n't come in on a freight dressed like that . " He shrugged , apologetically , almost as if he were asking forgiveness of the great American rail system , and said , " No , I flew . " " You broke the curse ! " He lifted his hands as if to say , " it was nothing , " and asked , " You got a favorite place to eat around here ? I 'll buy you dinner . I owe you plenty . It 's the least I can do . " I could n't believe the change in Rob until I remembered that he 'd been an observer . He 'd gone all over the country , seen everything , but seldom spoke . And he had n't missed a trick . We got a booth at Casa Milano and ordered - northern Italian fare and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mostly listened : " I read those columns over and over again , Red - both yours and the ones about Elizabeth . And the letter from Elizabeth . You never saw that letter , did you ? " I shook my head . " Essentially it said just two things ; " I loved you/and " Why did you leave ? ' " " Wow . " " Yeah . It was hard to hear ; not like I did n't know it . It was pretty strong and it was final , but I knew that I had to answer her . I knew I had to go back . " " You could have written a letter . " " No , " he said . " That would n't have been right . I had no address so she could n't have responded . I had to go see her . " I was afraid she hated me . She had every right to , and I knew that . " " You wanted to give her her shot , " I said . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted it to end , even if she wound up hating me . " I remembered the columns about her career with the Philharmonic , about her charity work . " She would n't have done that , " I said . " You 'd be surprised at what people will do , " he replied , staring into his glass . " You 'd truly be surprised . " He sighed , and a shadow seemed to pass across his face before he spoke again . " No , I hoped that she would n't hate me ; it would have been more than I could bear but I needed to know . I needed to seal it off and either die or heal somehow . " " You were tired of the trains . " He laughed tightly . " Oh , you have no idea . So I rode a freight into L.A. and I went out to Griffith Park to watch the Philharmonic rehearse . " After they finished , I figured that she 'd go off with her friends but she walked out to the seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the next concert 's music , making notations . She was still tall and slim , but her long curly hair was gray now and she carried herself with , well , with such grace and peacefulness . " I sat for a long time in the seats above , watching her . She was sitting where we had first met years ago . God , Red , it was breaking my heart . " I nodded . I 'd had my heart broken more than once , and knew how the smallest thing could set it off . " Did you - ? " " Yeah . After a while , I got up and walked down to her . She looked up , and for a moment she could n't place me so I said , " Elizabeth , it 's me , Rob . " " Red , do you know how it is when someone hears something they ca n't take in and there 's this curtain that comes down across their face and hides everything until they can sort it out ? That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She just stared at me . " Finally she picked up her sheet music from the seat beside her and I sat down , hunting for words . Spending most of your time alone does n't make you a good conversationalist and I 'm a quiet person anyway . Finally I said , " It 's good to see you . You 're looking well . " " She looked at me for a long time and then she touched my face , like she was trying to make sure that I was real . Then she asked me why I 'd run away . I said that I could n't live with myself with what I 'd done , that I had n't gone out to run away , but had gone to kill myself . " I nodded , numbly , and Rob closed his eyes at the memory . Then he went on . " When I said it , she grabbed my hand and everything came out of me in a rush , - how I could have saved Tommy but I did n't , how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How I had lost everything , but that she lost her son , and how I decided that there was no point , nothing , not anything . I had gone to kill myself . I went out to step in front of a train , but it stopped , and I got on and I never came back . " I was hyperventilating and I froze up . I needed her to say something , and she did . She said , " Rob , you just disappeared . I called the police . They found your car . You were n't home . Rob , you broke my heart . " Just like that , she said it . I broke her heart . " " Jesus . " " Yeah , Jesus , Red . She said that if I had stayed we could have gotten through it somehow . And she asked why I 'd come back , so I told her about the trains and the curse but I do n't think she believed it - not then . I told her I 'd come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd forgiven me the same night it happened . And she asked the sixty-four-dollar question . " " ' What now ? ' " " What now . I said I did n't know , but that if it was any consolation , I had never stopped loving her all these years . It was true , but at that moment it must have sounded pretty pathetic because she started talking about how she 'd had a daughter , how she had the orchestra and her other activities , and how comfortable she 'd become with being alone . And that 's when I felt it . " " What ? " " The pain in my chest . I 'd been away from the trains almost an entire day finding her and they were calling me back . I had n't broken the curse . So I sat there , listening to her talk about her self-contained life , and finally she asked if I would come to dinner . Because I knew she was just being nice I had to say no , that I had to get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the Alien Avenue Crossover in Burbank , and she said fine . " I shook my head . It was a hard way to go , and I knew what he must have been feeling . All that time , and he 'd come back and blown his best and only chance . Rob sipped his wine silently , remembering . Finally I could n't take it anymore . " Jesus , Rob . What happened ? " " We drove out to the Alien Avenue Crossover , the same place where I went to the rails twenty eight years ago . As we pulled up and stopped I noticed that Elizabeth was crying . She kept saying that she was sorry but she could n't . " " Could n't ? Could n't love you ? " " Could n't commit . Could n't change her life to include me . I understood that . I got out of the car and it was starting to rain . She walked to the tracks with me and we held each other and I swear , Red , it actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet and total , the best kiss I 'd ever had and something in her flipped . Some off-switch clicked to on . " She started to yell , and then scream and her words began to make sense . She was yelling at the heavens , at the gods , to let me go , to give her man back . Thunder exploded overhead and I was afraid for Elizabeth , that I 'd drawn the curse to her . Then it let loose . A bolt of lightning hit the signal bridge and blew it apart and there was a bright flash and the next thing I knew I was on my back , on the ground in the rain . Elizabeth was shaking me and calling my name ; I smelled smoke - and it was me . " " It hit you . " " It hit both of us , but we were n't harmed . And the curse was gone . She did it . She gave me the love of a pure woman and broke the curse . " We were staring at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rob took a sip of wine and I downed the rest of my water in one long gulp . " So you 're living in L.A. again , " I said at last . " Yeah , " he said . " I 'm good , and Liz and I are together . " " A fairy tale ending . " " We 're working on it , " Rob said . " And there 's one more thing to take care of . " He pushed an envelope across to me . Written on it was John " Red " Corcoran . I opened it . " A June wedding . Good for you . " " We want you there , Red . I want you to be my best man . " " Really ? " " Really . Will you come ? " " I 'd be honored . But , Dutch - your best man ? Why me ? " " Of all the people who picked me up on those trains , you were the only one who took the time to help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
