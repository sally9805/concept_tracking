A history of my suburban early ambitions would sound utterly conventional . At the age of six I wanted to be a cowboy . At twelve I decided instead to become a professional football player , which , for someone who would never weigh more than a hundred and thirty pounds , was even more hopeless . In high school I made up my mind to be a writer . As in most such cases , it was n't the work of writing that appealed to me . It was that , secretly , I never wanted to do any work at all . But teenagers are rarely of one mind , and their inconsistent wishes seldom come true in a recognizable way . <p> " What is the use of having money if you have to work for it ? " Violet Malone disdainfully asks her father-in-law , a self-made Irish-American billionaire , in George Bernard Shaw 's play Man and Superman . A century ago , when Shaw was writing , the different valuation that Americans and Europeans set on work as an abstract ideal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . By that time the " gospel of work " preached by Thomas Carlyle , who repeated endlessly that " work is alone noble , " was a mid-Victorian relic . <p> To her perfectly reasonable question , the Englishwoman Violet receives no answer . She would be just as baffled a hundred years later . If humans are the only animal that does n't think the purpose of life is to enjoy it , Americans are an especially hard case . Today those of us with full-time employment typically put in several hundred more hours per year than western Europeans  --  the equivalent of seven additional weeks , according to some surveys . Even the proverbially hardworking Germans spend only about three-quarters as many hours on the job and retire younger . Our disposable income is correspondingly higher , though when asked whether we would prefer more leisure to greater wealth , most of us opt for leisure . Statistics on voluntary overtime , however , suggest that we may not be telling the truth . A long American tradition leads people to define themselves not just by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . <p> Captain John Smith 's declaration that those who do not work shall not eat is the real national motto , ratified by subsequent authorities from Benjamin Franklin to Donald Trump . Rockefellers and Kennedys , whose international counterparts would spend all their time collecting works of art , instead work conspicuously hard at finance or politics . The American way is to prove one 's worth by long hours , almost regardless of what one actually accomplishes . The fact that many people appear to work hard while actually coasting through the week merely confirms the gap between what they think they should be doing and their actual preferences . <p> Consider the fate of the word workaholism , coined by W. E. Oates in 1968 to identify a disturbing psychological obsession  --  an " addiction , " a " compulsion "  --  that Oates had noticed around him . Others took up the new term enthusiastically . " The workaholic , as an addict is called , neglects his family , withdraws from social life , and loses interest in sex , " the Sydney Bulletin explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost all connotation of pathology and became a compliment . " Unlike their workaholic American cousins , " Time reported in 1981 , " Europeans tend to see lengthy vacations as somehow part of the natural order of things . " Today the word is most often heard in the proud boast " I 'm a workaholic , " recited ad nauseam by type A personalities in corporations , politics , and the professions . Carlyle lives , if only in America . <p> Why on earth do we do it ? Do most of us really prefer to work  --  to spend our lives in labor as an end rather than as an unavoidable means to our own or others ' happiness ? Of course not . Most jobs are boring at best , with few psychic rewards . Nobody works on an assembly line or at Wal-Mart , or recites the weather on Channel 9 , simply for lack of a pleasanter way to spend two thousand hours every year . It 's true that the most energetic and gregarious of us , the kind who have been claiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , " often find even jobs like these a relief from loneliness . One suspects , though , that if they suddenly did n't need the money or respect , they would quickly turn to playing games instead , or traveling the world , or finding innovative new ways to cope . The upper-middleclass professions are supposed to be a different story . Doctors , lawyers , and college professors usually think of themselves as " committed , " with the implication that there is nothing they would rather be doing . <p> Speaking from experience , I can attest that being a senior academic is one of the more privileged assignments in life , although anyone who thinks universities are relaxed , humane centers for the free play of intellect has n't spent much time in one lately . Plenty of hard work goes into getting a Ph.D. , achieving tenure , and practicing a profession that despite its flattering self-image involves as much stress , conformity , and tedium as other occupations . In response to charges made a few years ago that professors are slackers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-time university faculty member puts in between forty-five and fifty-five hours a week . Some of what I do for a living is fun  --  though I discovered early that writing anything meant to be read by others involves a good deal of labor  --  and the rest is pleasanter than what many people have to do . But still . Most of your waking hours for forty years ? <p> There is something deeply conflicted about the devotion to work , vocation , career as an ideal in any society , but especially in one that has zealously cast off so many of its other repressions . Americans at the beginning of the twenty-first century pursue pleasure with the same avid desperation as upscale high school students pursue getting into the right college  --  that is , with a hell of a lot of work . We have all been so oversocialized that an unnatural devotion to toil leaves its mark on every area of life . It could even be argued that the most highly prized pleasures have themselves become a form of work , complete with their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own conflicted attitude probably owes something to the fact that during the summer between high school and college , I worked as an information clerk for the National Heart Institute in a suburb of the capital . As a temporary , I spent my days keeping track of offprints from medical journals , answering requests for the Heart Institute 's own publications , and cleaning out the primitive photocopier . Much of the time there was not enough work to keep me busy , and like other low-level civil servants , I soon discovered that the Washington summer in a building with no air conditioning called for a relaxed approach to the public 's business . <p> Most mornings I stayed in my office filling orders from schoolteachers for our most popular publication , a garish poster titled " The Living Pump . " Having answered the mail as best I could , I generally retreated in the heat of the afternoon to the comfortable underground vault where our own materials and hundreds of articles on heart disease were stored . This fastness lay beneath a building that had been constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal basement , it had four sub-basements reached by a freight elevator that no one else seemed to use . Once I got to the bottom , I made my way through nearly half a mile of corridors filled with abandoned office furniture . I never encountered another human being down there , just thousands of desks and chairs and filing cabinets that nobody wanted anymore . After several hours in this environment , it was easy to believe the world had ended , and all that was left of the United States government was one GS-2 surrounded by acres of junk five levels below ground zero . It seemed odd to me that reams of Living Pumps would survive Armageddon while the doctors who ran the National Institutes of Health turned into dust , but eighteen-year-olds have a high tolerance for irrationality . That 's one reason they make good soldiers . I catalogued the contents of my bunker , restocked as necessary , composed juvenile light verse , and read a lot of novels in the cool silence . Some July afternoons I thought seriously about canceling my college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Department of Health , Education , and Welfare , as it was then called , had its headquarters on Independence Avenue in downtown Washington . Olive , a Southern widow who must have been in her fifties , presided over the Heart Institute 's offices there . She had worked in similar offices since the New Deal and had seen bosses come and go . A slim woman of vast charm and presence , she liked young men who would spend Friday afternoons in her office drinking coffee and conversing . I retain only the general impression of an elegant lady from a different world where manners and human contact counted for nearly everything and bureaucratic procedures for nothing . Without ever saying so , she conveyed through her demeanor that the government was too absurd to worry about . My guess , although I really have no idea , is that Olive did her job very well , if in an unconventional fashion . Whoever was nominally her superior must have had a difficult time until he tacitly agreed that everything she did would be done her way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to believe what her way meant to my weekly routine . Every Thursday I would receive a slip entitling me to take a pickup truck out of the motor pool on Friday and drive it downtown to HEW . On alternate Friday mornings I would load the truck with publications from the bunker . Then I would have lunch , drive to Olive 's office , unload the truck , and spend the afternoon listening , like a young man out of a Faulkner novel . The next Friday I would drive an empty truck to HEW , load it up with the same publications I had delivered the previous week , and return them to Bethesda . It sounds worse than it seemed at the time . Perhaps I 'm forgetting some deliveries that served a real purpose beyond bringing me into Olive 's presence . The possibility that my cheerful , unambitious colleagues would object to these excursions did not occur to me , and nobody ever did . <p> Everyone has met people who boast ( sometimes repetitively ) of loving their work so much that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement . Star athletes , successful artists , and research scientists are sometimes credible when they make these assertions . Occasionally an obstetrician goes on delivering babies into his nineties , and the local newspaper praises his enthusiasm for life . But who believes middle managers when they claim to spend the weekend looking forward to Monday ? Who takes teachers seriously in June when they say they ca n't wait for September ? If hypocrisy is the tribute vice pays to virtue , the oddity here is that so many people believe work as such , work divorced from any particular achievement , is especially virtuous . Working to earn one 's bread is something few people can escape . Working out of moral vanity is sheer self-deception . <p> Of course Americans did n't invent the idea . As with so many things , we merely perfected it . To get people to do their best over a long period of time , it has always been necessary to make what they do seem both a duty and a pleasure , something like rearing children . Seneca assured affluent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evils of idleness can be shaken off by hard work . " In a similar vein , Voltaire wrote , " Work keeps us from three great evils , boredom , vice , and need . " These are the homilies of the fortunate . Those who have been forced to work hard are often more realistic about what is at stake . " I do n't like work  --  no man does , " Joseph Conrad 's alter ego Marlow announces in Heart of Darkness , and then adds , "  --  but I like what is in work  --  the chance to find yourself . Your own reality  --  for yourself , not for others  --  what no other man can ever know . " The self-respect that comes from being financially self-supporting , as well as capable of some useful accomplishment for oneself or others , is a worthy goal for anyone . Fetishizing the labor itself is merely a form of bondage , workaholism in the true , perverse sense . <p> Because it serves so many different practical and psychic purposes , it 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkinson , " work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion . " Still , much can be said not just for the strenuous , cultivated leisure that hardworking professionals sometimes allow themselves to imagine as an alternative to virtuous toil , but for bone-idleness . There is in fact no indication that those who work are happier than those who choose not to . After surveying a mass of research on what it takes to make people happy , the psychologist David Watson declares , " With the notable exception of involuntary unemployment , we see little evidence that occupational and employment status have a major impact on well-being . Generally speaking , people in seemingly uninteresting , low-status jobs report levels of happiness and life satisfaction that are quite comparable to those of individuals in high-status occupations . Moreover , the employed and voluntarily unemployed report extremely similar levels of affect and well-being . " He concludes , " One particularly interesting implication of this literature is that people apparently devote much of their lives to striving after things  --  education , marriage , money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their happiness . " Although having some goals in life seems to work better than having none , " happiness is primarily a subjective phenomenon ... not highly constrained by objective circumstances . " <p> If your work wo n't make you or anyone else happier , why do more of it than you have to ? Believers in the gospel of work typically consider happiness irrelevant . Deep down , they think we have a duty to be miserable . As usual , the bullying Carlyle put it most brutally : " ' Happy , ' my brother ? First of all , what difference is it whether thou art happy or not ! ... The only happiness a brave man ever troubled himself with asking much about was , happiness enough to get his work done . Not ' I ca n't eat ! ' but ' I ca n't work ! ' that was the burden of all wise complaining among men . " Men must work , and women must weep , as Carlyle 's friend Charles Kingsley decreed . Work itself , work as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Carlyle and many of his readers no longer believed in . <p> In America this grim pseudo-religion continues to draw worshippers on a scale no longer seen elsewhere in the Western world . The only major change is that women are now expected to work like men . We speak in reverent tones of the " work ethic " ; politicians praise " working families " and , even in times of relatively low unemployment , make job creation an issue in every campaign . A few years ago , cutting the work week was a central promise in a French election , and the government actually passed laws on the subject . In the United States , by contrast , legislation has been introduced to make overtime easier for companies to afford . We abolished mandatory retirement in the 1980s . Despite the growth in productivity and affluence over the past decades , all the social pressures are for working longer hours and later in life rather than cashing in on the promise of greater leisure  --  partly to take some of the pressure off Social Security and Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . <p> I do n't know about the civil service , but not many Olives are left in major universities . Sometimes I dream of my vault full of Living Pumps . A colleague and I recently passed the time by talking speculatively of retirement . " You would n't actually retire at sixty-five , would you ? " this proud workaholic asked with incredulity . <p> " Of course , " I gulped , suddenly and unexpectedly defensive about my secret plan to quit at sixty-two . " Why not ? " <p> He shrugged disdainfully and went back to writing his next book on Chaucer .
