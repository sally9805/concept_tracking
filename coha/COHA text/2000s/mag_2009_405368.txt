COERCION OR COMPASSION ? Thanks for your important and informative article on " crisis pregnancy centers . " It makes me incredibly upset that basic health care and basic information are being denied to women " Dangerous Masquerade , " Fall 2008 . Instead of help , these women are being given misinformation and guidance that is coercive rather than compassionate . A few years ago I found out I was pregnant , and made a decision that it was not the right time in my life to have a child . My doctor , whom I had been going to for years and whom I trusted , knew that if I was pregnant my choice would be to have an abortion . But she waited until the tests had come back positive to let me know that she would not refer me for an abortion on personal moral grounds . Worse , she tried to persuade me that most doctors are against abortion and would refuse me . When I asked if there was anyone who could help me , she said that Planned Parenthood might but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignation that my mother , who was in the waiting room , would support my decision . I did of course find a doctor who helped me . A few months later I started my M.A at the University of Western Ontario , and found out that UWO had earlier that year given an honorary degree to Dr. Henry Morgentaler , a pro-choice activist who has bravely fought to increase options in women 's health care in Canada . I am glad that there are strong , empathetic people in the world who , despite threats and misinformation , still fight for women 's rights . - Allison Smith Nova Scotia , Canada MILITARY JUSTICE After reading " The Scandal of Military Rape , " Fall 2008 I am impressed with the entire content , including the part concerning our daughter Army Pfc . Lavena Johnson , who was found dead under very suspicious circumstances on her Iraq military base in 2005 . We look forward to telling our story whenever the opportunity presents itself . We do so not just for pursuing justice for our daughter , but our goal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military for whatever reason do not have their virginity , their lives and their citizenship violently taken away from them . We will also be pushing to get some changes in how these occurrences in the military are handled . News sources like Mf. magazine are helping out , whereas the national media has failed us as well as the females in the military . We really appreciate your kind words and your show of compassion for us . The support we have gotten from information sources such as yourself makes the fight worthwhile . - Dr . John &; Linda Johnson Florissant , MO We need more equality in the military . I 'm a woman and an officer in the Air Force and much too often we are not treated as equals to our male counterparts . There needs to be reform in our Air Force Academy , VMI Virginia Military Institute , the Naval Academy and other military colleges . There should be no tolerance for when women cadets are called " she-dets " and when rumors are spread about them by male cadets just so they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain Home Air Force Base , ID A BAD MOOD , OR A MENTAL ILLNESS ? Rachel E. McCready Letters , Fall 2008 expresses concern about my critique of the psychiatric label " premenstrual dysphoric disorder " ( PMDD ) in my article , " Pathologizing Your Period " Summer 2008 , because she used to become depressed before her period . As a feminist I am particularly careful to respect what women tell me when they say they are suffering ; but the question is not whether or not some women have upsetting moods premenstrually but rather whether this should be called a mental illness , which is how PMDD is classified . Ms. McCready 's report that her gynecologist helped her by advising that she eliminate foreign hormones and processed foods is a great example of the benefits of looking to such causes of mood changes radier than calling them mental illnesses . That her gynecologist nevertheless diagnosed her with PMDD rather than with dietary problems is worrying . - Paula J. Caplan , Ph.D . Cambridge , MA OUTRAGE OVER PRYING Thank you for profiling Dr. George Tiller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 . I want others to become as outraged as I am after reading the article about lawmakers prying into patients ' medical records . I was his patient 22 years ago . At 15 , I was pregnant and in deep denial . When I finally talked to my parents , Dr. Tiller was my only option . Dr. Tiller and his staff treated me and my family with compassion . He allowed me a choice . Words can not express my gratitude . Dr. Tiller provides more than a service for women ( girls , teenagers ) and their families ; he gives them their lives back . - Krista Pennie Myers Memphis , TN VACCINE QUESTIONED As a charter subscriber to Ms. , I have read every issue from cover to cover . So I remember the hope with which you reported on the HPV vaccine " Lifesaving Politics , " Spring 2007 . We all had hopes that cervical cancer would become a disease of the past . However , the evidence of horrific side effects and unintended results is mounting , as is the data that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great advocate of this vaccine when it was introduced , it would behoove us to now issue warnings urging at least great caution in its use , and potentially demanding a recall of the entire stock . One of the most worrisome concerns is the requirement for all immigrants to receive the HPV vaccination in order to obtain a green card . Since evidence exists that this vaccine causes infertility , this campaign takes on overtones of discrimination . We have a whole young generation of feminists to protect . Let us not fall down in our duties now . - Andria Anderson Chicago , IL Editors ' note : According to Dr. Beth Jordan , medical director of the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals and the Feminist Majority Foundation , these statements do n't reflect the science . Overall , studies show that the vaccine is safe and effective , and it has been administered to millions of women around the world . More than 16 million doses of Gardasil have been distributed in the U.S. , and surveillance data from the manufacturer , Merck , and the Centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - only 6 percent ( about 420 of them ) deemed serious . Of those , the causal link to Gardasil is not clear ; studies are ongoing . Since this is a new vaccine , scientists wo n't be able to judge its long-term effectiveness in preventing cervical cancer for years , but it has already been proven to decrease the transmission of precancerous lesions , as well as decrease noncancerous genital warts . Women should still try to prevent exposure from HPV and other sexually transmitting infections by using condoms , having regular Pap screenings - as well as considering the HPV vaccine . Ms. magazine will publish a more thorough update on Gardasil in a forthcoming issue . DOLORES &; MS . LIGHT A SPARK It is important to let people know not only of the accomplishments of people like Dolores Huerta " Vva Dolores ! , " Summer 2008 but also their struggles . How many people know she has been physically beaten at a rally ? How many people know the blood , sweat and tears that she shed along the road to help unionize farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggles and accomplishments of Dolores Huerta and activists like her . I am very inspired , as I am sure many people are , that the good deeds mat people do in this world do not go unrecognized , and that they do make a difference in the world . I would like to commend Ms. magazine not only for me article but for lighting the spark in people , that they may strive to make their mark on the world for the better . - Jose Rios Via email OUR LITTLE FEMINIST Hi . My name is Makiah Lee . I 'm 13 and love my Ms. My mom had got me to read this magazine one day when I was bored and complaining . Well , I read the whole magazine over . So my Mommy now calls me her " little feminist . " Thank you so much for writing such a wonderful magazine . - Kiah Lee Medford , OR PRISONER 'S PERSPECTIVE After reading the letters under the heading " Prison Voices " Letters , Fall 2008 , it dawned on me why I never received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story would have activated someone 's censor awareness , particularly if it was listed on the cover . Thank you for having the courage to cover our plight . I 've spent 16 of my 18 years of incarceration in litigation , suing in a Massachusetts federal court for an operation that several nationally recognized experts have stated is medically necessary . The defendants and their lawyers have engaged in a brutal pattern of denial of medical care that they believe is unnecessary . They presented perjurous testimony and tried to stifle their own medical staff for agreeing with my medical needs , but I 'm one of the lucky ones : The court appointed me a brilliant , dedicated woman to represent me pro bono , and she has been with me since 1999 , through two trials in federal court . Like your magazine , she has done her best to erase the throwaway status of prisoners . As long as state prison systems like mine are exempt from oversight by the state auditor , these abuses will continue , and my sisters will drop off the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ms. Keep it up ; someone has to . - Michelle Lynne Kosilek Massachusetts Correctional Institute Norfolk , MA MORE SEXUAL HEALING Former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders ' article " Sexual Healing " in the Summer 2008 edition was an important call to action for the next administration , as well as to anyone who is concerned about the healm of women and girls . This article , however , neglected to highlight the crucial connection between female reproductive health and sexual violence . According to the National Violence Against Women Survey issued by the National Institute of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2000 , 17.6 percent , or over 17 million women , have been victims of rape . It is estimated that over 800,000 rape victimizations against women happen each year . Victims of sexual violence suffer both physically and emotionally . Beyond serious injury , victims are also at risk for sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies . The National Violence Against Women Survey also showed that young women are suffering die brunt of this social problem - over 60 percent of females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 24 ; an additional 22 percent were under the age of 12 . Unfortunately , there is a significant correlation between experiencing sexual assault at a young age and teen pregnancy . It is estimated that 60 percent of teen girls ' first pregnancies are preceded by experiences of molestation , rape or attempted rape . Protecting women 's reproductive freedom and health is not just about providing education about safe sex and access to contraception . It is also about acknowledging the risks and consequences of experiencing sexual violence , by raising awareness , implementing prevention strategies nationwide , and offering care to a victim that is comprehensive , accessible and free . - Harriet Lessel , LCSW Executive director of NYC Alliance Against Sexual Assault New York , NY COMPUTER SCIENCE NEEDS WOMEN I am delighted to see the squib , " Girls + Math = Smart ! " Keeping Score , Fall 2008 . However , I am surprised by your claim that " Young women now make up 48 percent of college math majors . " I wonder where you get that number . It is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much diese days . I would be much more interested to see what percentage of the students who graduate with a bachelor 's degree in math are women ( young or otherwise ) . I gather that that number is significantly below 48 percent at my university , and the percentage of graduates in computer science is even lower these days . It has never been anywhere near 48 percent , but the National Science Foundation 's tracking indicates that it has been shrinking even as the percent of engineering degrees that go to women has been growing . I 'd love to see you do an article looking at that trend , and promoting computer science as a major for women . There are lots of great jobs and opportunities to make the world a better place - and have fun doing so . - Dr . Judy Goldsmith Professor , Department of Computer Science , University of Kentucky Lexington , KY Editors7 note : The 48 percent figure came from a study in the journal Science , but you 're right - the most recent survey by the Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - women 's percentage of mathematics and statistics undergraduate degrees has dropped to 43.4 percent , after holding steady at 46 to 41 percent from 1985 to 2000 . And , as you correctly note , computer science is dismal when it comes to gender representation : Women earn only 17.9 percent of undergraduate degrees . GIVE ME A BREAK Suze Orman " Suze Orman ' s Bottom Line , " Fall 2008 , while she might be good-hearted , fails to see that the individual fiscal problems of women stem from not only personal money handlings but more so from the fact that we are living in a sexist and classist society . I am by no means suggesting that we can not take charge of our individual finances , but I am suggesting that her rhetoric is typical of the way our society blames individuals for what are largely social problems . If we really want to get serious about money as women , we should be organizing to end classism and the great divide between the poor and rich in our society . We will not solve our financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupons . Give me a break ! - Carrie Vandenburg Via email ADDRESS ALL CORRESPONDENCE TO Letters to the Editor , Ms. magazine , 433 S.
