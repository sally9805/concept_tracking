The National Council for the Social Studies defines social studies as " the integrated study of the social sciences and humanities to promote civic competence . " The council further declares that " in essence , social studies promotes knowledge of and involvement in civic affairs " and that the study of anthropology , geography , history , and law  --  among other disciplines  --  will expedite the development of this process for our students . The Web page " About National Council for the Social Studies , " at &lt; http : //www.ncss.org/&gt; contains additional information . <p> One particularly useful way to present the four disciplines is to discuss the history of the aboriginal peoples of North America . The diversity of customs and habitats under which those people lived in the past  --  and in which they live today  --  is one of the many possible topics for consideration in the social studies classroom . Images of such groups as the whaling tribes of the Pacific Northwest or the Inuit of the North can be coupled with those of the Seminole in Florida ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southwest . Along with an examination of the tribes , we can teach about the experiences of the explorers and the settlers and about the growth of the United States . Pushing Westward <p> Manifest Destiny became a powerful U.S. policy in the nineteenth century . The initial " high hopes of saving souls in North America " ( Horsman 1981 , 103 ) that the Puritans held were replaced by an enthusiasm to displace the indigenous peoples , particularly in the area west of the Mississippi after the Louisiana Purchase , to facilitate agrarian and speculative goals . Indeed , the proposals of the eighteenth-century jurist Emmerich de Vattel , which required active or even obligatory land cultivation to improve Nature , meant that the hunting and gathering behaviors of the tribes were perceived as leaving the land empty for such pursuits . That approach also included the view that the tribes had no legal title to the land , despite evidence to suggest that many tribes were less than nomadic ( Stephanson 1995 ) . That was in direct opposition to the earlier writings of the Spanish priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact did possess original title to their land ( Cohen 1982 ) . Annexation of additional territory followed , especially through the mid-nineteenth century , and the moralistic philosophy underlying the concept of Manifest Destiny developed to support those activities , even though the Supreme Court concluded in Cherokee v. Georgia ( 1831 ) that Victoria 's conclusion was the correct one . <p> Chiodo ( 2000 ) recently presented a lesson plan for teaching Manifest Destiny to junior and senior high school students . Part of his rationale was to " understand the attitudes that eventually developed toward Native Americans and blacks when they were mistreated by white settlers when they moved west " ( Chiodo 2000 , 204 ) . Two relevant attributes of that plan were to show the " nineteenth century doctrine of the United States to justify westward expansion " and a demonstration that the policy of Manifest destiny " occurred at the expense of outsiders ( individuals who were not citizens of the United States . . . ) . " Concerning the latter attribute , Chiodo 's evaluation would include student responses that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in those areas ( 204-205 ) . <p> During the period following independence and within that political climate , the vast majority of the presidents listed in appendix A faced the obligations of making treaties with the Native American tribes . That could not have been a light responsibility , given the diversity of Indian societies and tribal organizations throughout the continent . The variety is reflected directly in the locations of the signatory tribes to the treaties listed in appendix B. George Washington dealt with the tribes of the original colonies , whereas later presidents who made treaties with the Apache and Pacific Northwest tribes faced the difficulty of administering treaties made with groups that lived on the other side of the continent , groups that were unknown to Washington and his contemporaries . The texts of the treaties listed in appendix B reveal those changes . Washington 's first proclaimed treaty ( the Treaty with the Wyandot , etc. , 1789 ) includes the statement that the United States " relinquish and quit claim to the said nations respectively , all the lands lying between the limits above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt upon , and otherwise to occupy as they shall see fit " ( Kappler 1972 , 19 ) . The attempt to define a peaceful coexistence is replaced eighty years later in the text of the last treaty proclaimed by Ulysses S. Grant in the Treaty with the Klamath , etc. , 1864 by the following opening sentence of the first article : " The tribes of Indians aforesaid cede to the United States all their right , title , and claim to all the country claimed by them " ( Kappler 1972 , 865 ) . <p> Thus , removal , as documented in the texts of the treaties with the tribes , and not assimilation assured the availability of land for expansion , certified the parameters of Manifest Destiny , and forever modified the national perception of Indian tribes in North America . Indeed , the mechanics of the adopted policies made it easier to address the question . The documents produced during those negotiations offer a window onto the philosophy of the time , particularly those aspects concerning the federal government 's view of its responsibilities  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also clear sociological avenues for broad student investigations . Classes may focus on the hunting , fishing , and gathering experiences of the native peoples under their dissimilar geographic conditions , and those investigations may be applied to the experiences of the settlers , as well . As another instructional vehicle , teachers can emphasize the developing political and physical geography of statehood and of the United States during the stages of expansion and supplement that with descriptions of the changes to the tribal populations . The names of tribes are reflected in those of the new states ; one may consider Illinois , Iowa , Kansas , and Missouri to understand the richness of Native American influence in history . Negotiating Treaties with Various Native American Tribes <p> Jeff Orr ( 1996 ) presents a suggestion for blending the disciplines of history and law to engage junior high school and secondary students by focusing on the negotiation process of a Canadian First Nations treaty entitled Treaty Four , signed in 1874 . Orr discovered that many treaties negotiated with the First Nations are not part of Canadian history textbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his classroom activities . To demonstrate tribal administrative sophistication , the activities include a historical consideration of the negotiating prowess of the tribes and of their interactions before the Europeans arrived . Orr further proposed that an examination of King George III 's Royal Proclamation of 1763 ( Commager 1973 , 47-50 ) would illuminate the rights and responsibilities of all signatories contained in Treaty Four . The proclamation was particularly important because it set the standard for government-to-government administration and thereby created the understanding of tribal sovereignty in British North America . In addition , Orr contributed questions that targeted distinct aspects of paragraphs within Treaty Four , with an eye to understanding the different perceptions of the aboriginal and government negotiators . For example , he suggested that any analysis of the treaty should include contrasting the perspectives of the Indian and the European participants , a discussion of the phrase " all rights and privileges " contained in the text , consideration of the specific provisions provided to the tribes , and review of the agricultural expectations placed on the Indians by this document . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consideration of aspects of many disciplines that compose and contribute to the arena of social studies . <p> Orr 's fruitful suggestions for stimulating class discussion may be applied equally well to a study of treaties made with American Indians . Those instruments are rarely examined in any classroom ; yet the contracts offer a direct demonstration of the growth of the country and the interactions between the indigenous peoples and state and federal governments . Each recognized American Indian treaty was enacted into law , and unlike the practice in Canada , the documents were collated in the Statutes at Large . The first seventeen volumes of that resource are now available on-line from the Library of Congress &lt; http : //memory.loc.gov/ammem/ amlaw/lwsl.html&gt; . This electronic collection permits student and teacher to examine each of the Statutes at Large citations in the appendix B , except for Ratified Treaty 324 and Ratified Treaty 326 , which appeared in volume 18 . In addition , Charles J. Kappler compiled the final version of each of the particular Statutes at Large entries into one part of a five-volume collection , Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was distributed by the Government Printing Office through the Federal Depository Library program . The second volume , Indian Treaties , 1778-1883 , provides those treaty documents and was individually published ( Kappler 1972 ) . The Oklahoma State University Library &lt; http : **41;2742;TOOLONG has now digitized images of the pages and the text of several volumes of Kappler 's work , including the treaties volume . <p> The accessibility to the entire range of U.S. instruments affords a broader panorama , reaching beyond Orr 's Canadian activity plans with only Treaty Four . One can see historical changes in the evolution of the texts of the treaties for the period from just after the Revolutionary War until the conclusion of the War of 1812 . Following the Treaty of Ghent , concern with British-tribal alliances disappeared . Article nine of the Treaty of Peace and Amity Between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America , 1814 ( 8 Stat .218 ) addressed the reconciliation process between the United States and the tribes : <p> The United States of America engage to put an end immediately after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribes or Nations of Indians with whom they may be at war at the time of such Ratification , and forthwith to restore to such Tribes or Nations respectively all the possessions , rights , and privileges which they may have enjoyed or been entitled to in one thousand eight hundred and eleven previous to such hostilities . ( 8 Stat . 218 , 222 ) <p> The result of that reappraisal is reflected in the manner of the later treaty instruments . The evolution of negotiations over the following half-century demonstrated the growth of the United States and the transformations that occurred during that expansion . <p> Only after 1836 can one consistently find in the Statutes at Large the actual presidential proclamation statements along with a confirming countersignature from the Secretary of State appended to the documents . President Martin Van Buren 's concluding proclamation statement for the Treaty between the Choctaws and Chickasaws in the Statutes at Large ( 11 Stat. 573 , 575 ) , is representative : <p> Now be it known that I , MARTIN VAN BUREN , President of the United States of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do , by these presents , declare that I approve and confirm the same , and every clause and article thereof . <p> This statement was Ratified Treaty # 220 , proclaimed on March 24 , 1837 . The wording of the final statement made by Ulysses S. Grant for the document proclaimed last in the appendix B , Ratified Treaty # 332 , the Treaty with the Klamath , etc . Indians ( 16 Stat . 707 , 712 ) , is virtually identical to Van Buren 's : <p> Now , therefore , be it known that I , ULYSSES S. GRANT , President of the United States of America , do , in pursuance of the advice and consent of the Senate , as expressed in its resolution of the second of July , one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six , accept , ratify , and confirm the said treaty , with the amendments as aforesaid . <p> The similarity results from the standardization by the Department of State of protocol style for such statements , and the wording is a carry-over from British tradition ( Aufricht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Kappler 's compilation because he gathered only the final texts of the treaties , and the connection between each treaty and the proclaiming president is unclear . Treaties from Washington through Grant <p> To expedite the teaching of the history of those treaty documents and the presidents involved in making them , I compiled a list containing the treaties proclaimed during each administration . I collected the treaties for each president from George Washington through Ulysses S. Grant . Within each section , I indexed the documents by their Ratified Treaty Number , a number assigned to each instrument by the Department of State ( Ratified Indian Treaties , 1722-1869 , 1966 ) . In the Kappler compendium , the Ratified Treaty Numbers range from 8 to 374 . Treaties 1 through 7 were pre-Revolutionary War examples , and numbers 8 through 14 and number 16 do not have proclamation dates . The two appendices contain 359 proclaimed treaties . The data are supported by the relevant signatory tribal name(s) , the signing and proclamation dates , and the Statutes at Large citation . For three treaties  --  the Agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty # 19 ) ; the Treaty with the Oneida , 1798 ( # 28 ) ; and the Treaty with the Wyandot , Ottawa , Chippewa , Munsee , Delaware , Shawnee , and Potawatomi , 1805 ( # 44 )  --  there is no Statutes at Large citation , but the text is available in volume 1 of the American State Papers : Indian Affairs . For the Oneida treaty , the American State Papers entry is the only source ; there is neither a Kappler entry nor a Statutes at Large reference . Learning U.S. History by Studying Indian Treaties <p> What may we learn from the listed data , and what programs may be used to involve our students in studying these materials ? <p> As successive presidents proclaimed treaties in their administrations , we see unfolding the westward movement of settlers across the United States . Over the seventy-nine years of treaty making reviewed in the lists , George Washington proclaimed nine treaties that were made with eastern Indian tribes during his administration . Ulysses S. Grant 's proclamations pertain to three treaties with tribes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be used to develop a metric of U.S. historical time as the treaty signings and their proclamations occur . Knowing where the tribes lived imparts a very solid geographical lesson for students , and their linkage to Manifest Destiny becomes clearer . Such endeavors can be facilitated by the use of the Indians of North America map produced by the National Geographic Society ( 1999 ) . <p> The procedures of signing , ratification , and proclamation were frequently lengthy and difficult . There are individual treaty examples of very prompt proclamations following signings , but many treaties required additional amendments before the final version was proclaimed . Those processes are important aspects of the form and operation of the federal government in the United States . Treaty making with the tribes , acknowledged as sovereign nations , requires protocols that are used today in similar instruments with other nations . As an extreme example of the lag between the signing and the proclamation dates , the Treaty with the Cherokee , 1804 ( 7 Stat. 22 ) was " lost " for twenty years and was ratified only after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate ratification . Although that treaty is Ratified Treaty # 43 , because of the delay , it appears just before Ratified Treaty # 86 in the section of the list for James Monroe . If the treaty entries in the Monroe segment were sorted by ratification date instead of by Ratified Treaty Number , the Treaty with the Cherokee , 1804 would follow Ratified Treaty # 120 . In other words , whereas that Cherokee treaty was mislaid , almost eighty other Indian treaties had been proclaimed ( see Prucha 1994 , 111-12 ) . <p> The administrative records of the presidents provide insight into the difficulties of treaty making . Andrew Jackson made a staggering sixty-four such proclamations during his term in office , for fully 17 percent of the 374 Department of State enumerated treaties negotiated between the federal government and the Indian nations . That aggregate reveals a long sequential collection of documents , from Ratified Treaty # 155 , proclaimed in 1830 , to Ratified Treaty # 218 seven years later . In the middle of that array is Treaty # 192 , the Treaty with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adjustments were made  --  as shown by the second Statutes at Large citation in appendix B , and the rewritten document became the first treaty proclaimed in the subsequent Van Buren administration . The Statutes at Large entry at 7 Stat . 462 has a note that the original treaty , " not being in conformity to the views of the President of the United States , " was sent back for amendment . Prucha ( 1994,193-94 ) describes the controversy . One of the fundamental reasons for such a large number of instruments during Jackson 's administration was the focus on the removal of the eastern tribes . Roughly 100 million acres of Indian lands were obtained for money and for lands west of the Mississippi totaling one-third the acreage ( Satz 1975 , 97 ) . The exchange of eastern tribal lands for western allocations was a new strategy that was developed in the first third of the nineteenth century ( Prucha , 1974 , 146-47 ) . <p> Just as Van Buren inherited the Treaty with the Miami , 1834 from Jackson , Ulysses S. Grant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribes ended on March 3 , 1871 ( 16 Stat. 544 , 566 ) , had only three opportunities to proclaim a treaty , and each of those had been negotiated initially in a previous administration . Alternatively , we also can see examples of treaties with the tribes that were proclaimed by presidents Jefferson , Polk , Fillmore , and Andrew Johnson in the very late stages of their terms in office . The Senate was well aware of the difficulties of continuing the process under the dynamics of a new administration . <p> Not all presidents from Washington through Grant participated in these official activities . Neither William Henry Harrison ( president for one month in 1841 ) nor Zachary Taylor ( 1849-50 ) had an opportunity to proclaim a treaty with the tribes . Harrison , though , had been a very active United States commissioner between 1803 and 1815 , with thirteen negotiated treaties to his credit . I included both Harrison and Taylor in appendix A to identify all the presidents during the treaty-making years . <p> American Indian treaties have significant current legal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court supports this contention . In the 1999 Supreme Court case , Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians ( 526 U.S. 172 ) , the Court held that " after an examination of the historical record , we conclude that the Chippewa retain the usufructuary rights guaranteed to them by the 1837 Treaty " ( 526 U.S. 172 , 176 ) . The case was based on certain rights assured by the United States in Article 5 of the Treaty with the Chippewa , 1837 ( Kappler , 1972 , 491-93 ) , which states : " The privilege of hunting , fishing , and gathering the wild rice , upon the lands , the rivers and the lakes included in the territory ceded , is guaranteed to the Indians , during the pleasure of the President of the United States . " The harvesting rights assured in 1837 in the instrument proclaimed by Martin Van Buren are no less important today to the Chippewa . <p> Hunting , fishing , and gathering were the means to obtain tribal sustenance , and those rights remain extremely important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribes were designed to form alliances , but later treaties began to offer the tribes support for a transition to a more agricultural ( and sedentary ) economy , for education , and for improved health . Officials realized that the yield from traditional hunting and gathering methods would be diminished by the increasing presence of settlers during westward expansion in the United States . Improved education and health for tribal members were also considered good long-term investments for a stronger , more productive country . As a point of comparison , Orr stated that Treaty Four in Canada " represented the first treaty in which trapping rights were protected " ( Orr 1996 , 134 ) . That confirms the similarity of the needs and the rights of the tribes of Canada and of the United States . <p> The presidential act of proclamation is a vestige of British tradition . Aufricht ( 1943,114 ) states that : " the style of Presidential proclamations originated in the Chancelleries of the British King , and the rather antiquated wording of these proclamations proves a still living tradition . Thus any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking similarities . " In the classroom , the teacher can focus the discussion on the influence of the administration of the colonizing nations on the resulting managerial behavior of independent nations . In the present case , the influence of England on the colonies may be compared to the effect of French administration on the development of Canada . As one small glimpse of this transfer , early United States negotiations with the tribes were modeled on those of the predecessor British government , as were the physical format and process of treaty negotiations . The pre-Revolutionary War treaties # 1 through 7 were the prototypes for the negotiations conducted by the new United States . Hence , the legal underpinnings of British treaty making were instituted in initial United States policies with the tribes . <p> When students examine appendix A , they will see that the inaugural date for all listed presidents is different from the January 20 date on which presidents now enter office . Three special instances are also among the eighteen presidents ' inaugural dates . Vice Presidents John Tyler , Millard Fillmore , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Abraham Lincoln , respectively , after the death of each . Excluding the inaugural dates for those presidents taking office after the death of the previous president and for George Washington 's initial administration , March 4 was the inaugural date until the adoption of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933 . Once students note that change in dates , they can undertake a class discussion about amendments to the U.S. Constitution . <p> These topics can promote students ' understanding of westward expansion and U.S. relations with Native Americans . Orr 's model is easily adaptable to serve social studies classes in the United States , because the issues and perspectives that he raised in his plan for Canadian students require similar attention in this country . Moreover , by studying the range and scope of the treaties listed in appendix B , a teacher can have students conduct a broader , more countrywide investigation . A consideration of those viewpoints will stimulate students ' interests in several of the subject areas that the National Council for the Social Studies identifies as crucial to promote civic awareness .
