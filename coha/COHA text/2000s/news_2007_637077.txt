<p> Word on the decision had n't been out for an hour and the debate was raging . Bob Hartley was panicking , they said . He was messing with the psyche of his young goalie . He was a genius , not afraid to make the bold move . <p> One host of a sports talk-radio show asked the question before going to commercial : " What do you think of Bob Hartley 's decision ? " <p> In a city where football talk rules throughout the year , Friday afternoon was buzzing over a hockey move . <p> Hartley has benched starting goalie Kari Lehtonen for today 's game against the New York Rangers in favor of Johan Hedberg . <p> There were many who were surprised , including Lehtonen . But they should n't have been . Those who know Hartley best have learned that this time of year Hartley 's coaching style becomes especially unpredictable . <p> " You never know what Uncle Bob will be up to in the playoffs , " Tampa Bay general manager Jay Feaster said . <p> Feaster knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two were together in the AHL . In Hershey , Feaster saw Hartley pull out all the stops to win . He would throw pennies on the ice to stop play . He would instruct goaltenders to send pucks out of play to help rest players . <p> " There was the time the door to the visitors bench opened up and fell on the ice , " Feaster said with a laugh . <p> Anything it took to win . Anything it took to gain an edge over an opponent . <p> " Bob 's the kind of guy who will run over his mother to win the hockey game , and that 's with no apologies , " Feaster said . " If he can get the opposite team and coaches thinking about him and worrying about what he 's doing rather than focusing on the task at hand , that 's one up for Bob . He takes every possible advantage he can . " <p> And part of that is making sure the other team , as well his own players , are n't too comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness . And benching your starting goalie , a guy who set franchise records for wins and started 68 games this season , is anything but predictable . <p> " You ca n't be predictable , " Hartley said during a recent interview . " The day that you 're predictable is the day that people control you . They know what 's going to happen . ... You need to keep everyone on their toes , to keep everyone sharp and that 's something I pride myself in . " <p> Hartley is n't easy to play for , that 's something even he admits . His practices are demanding , and so are his requirements to get ice time . <p> He calls it playing the right way , not his way . <p> If you do it and match his work ethic , you 're in . If you do n't , well ... <p> " If you do n't do it , you 're not going to be out there , " said Joe Sakic , who won a Stanley Cup with Hartley in Colorado . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain way to forecheck , defensive zone coverages are the biggest thing . You have to take care of things not only offensively , but defensively . He really holds everybody accountable . If you do n't do it , you 're not going to be there . " <p> Hartley grew up a fan of the ultra-demanding coach Scotty Bowman , who won nine Stanley Cups while coaching Montreal , Pittsburgh and Detroit . <p> He can recall the moment he first met Bowman , when the legendary coach showed up at his office in Laval to talk about a young prospect Hartley was coaching . <p> They talked about Martin Lapointe , the young star , for a few minutes . Then the focus turned to coaching . <p> " It was kind of general coaching stuff , " Hartley remembered . " I was coaching for only five years , so I was a baby . When you have the master right in front of you  --  I saw he was in no hurry to leave , so I kind of drilled him . " <p> Hartley calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprise to see similarities in styles . <p> In 1997 , a young Chris Osgood started 47 games in goal during the regular season for Bowman 's Red Wings , but it was veteran goalie Mike Vernon whom Bowman turned to in the playoffs . <p> Bowman 's battles with a young Russian star , Sergei Federov , were well-documented as the coach tried to get the most of the player . <p> Surely , Ilya Kovalchuk could relate . <p> Now Bowman sees a lot he likes in Hartley  --  his work ethic , his ability to get the most out of his top players , his tireless preparation . <p> " He has strong beliefs in what he is doing , " Bowman said . " You have to have a game plan . I would say Hartley 's strong suit is his ability to get the right player on the ice at the right time . " <p> Sure there 's frustration over Hartley 's demands and style , especially from young players . <p> His own general manager concedes that Hartley 's demanding style is best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't ask anything out of his players that he 's not doing himself , but then again , his work ethic is second to none . It has to be nearly impossible to keep up . <p> " Veterans respond better to Bob 's style , there 's no doubt , " Thrashers general manager Don Waddell said . " As a young player , you can get rattled by the intensity that Bob brings to that the table . " <p> But those who win Hartley over , those who persevere through the tireless drills , the intense practices and even some of the mind games , more often than not , they 're rewarded . <p> Pascal Vincent played for Hartley in his earliest days as a coach , and now sees some of Bob Hartley in his own coaching style with the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League . <p> Sometimes , Vincent explained , the reasons for what Hartley does is as simple as they seem . <p> " Bob taught us this : These are the expectations . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only thing that matters , " Vincent said . " At the end of the day , you have to go home and say , ' Did I do the job ? Yes or no . ' " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : April 17 , 2007 <p> CORRECTION : <p> Thrashers player Scott Mellanby was incorrectly identified in a photo caption in Saturday 's Sports section .
