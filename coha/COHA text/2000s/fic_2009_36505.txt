1 <br> THE QUEEN <br> <p> CYNTHIA HUNSAKER Power stood shivering in her kitchen , a silk robe wrapped around her sylphlike body , and wondered whom she 'd have to fuck or fire to get a diet Red Bull . Her doe eyes , accentuated by last night 's false eyelashes , blinked at the challenge . She flicked her traight black ponytail faded only slightly by age , and smirked . Cynthia 's delicate mouth was stained , her beloved Chanel Red No. 5 intensifying her pale skin . Reality check , Cynthia , she thought , when was the last time you did either ? <p> The chef would n't arrive until daybreak , the French butler was still asleep , and the housekeepers and drivers and trainers had n't even tasted their first sip of coffee before hopping the train into Manhattan . Cynthia was alone in the kitchen , something she had n't been since Vivienne was a baby . Had it really been almost twenty-five years ? <p> She 'd been jostled awake by a recurring dream . <p> " Snakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clichTs . " She imagined her therapist Dr. Gold 's reaction : " Do n't waste my time , bubule . I 'm a very busy man . I 've got a full day of undersexed neurotics . " <p> Now . Find that Red Bull . The industrial-size refrigerator revealed nothing . There were no other clues . Her designer had prohibited appliances , declaring them aesthetically offensive . The kitchen looked like a morgue . <p> Open , close , open , open , slam , drawers upon drawers upon cabinets . No luck . Cynthia was sweating in her Hanros when she finally discovered a black machine with sleek lines ; could this be a coffeemaker ? It bore no resemblance to the dented aluminum percolator her mother had used back in Aurora , Missouri . She squinted , trying to make sense of the buttons and the timers and the vents . Cynthia refused to acknowledge the slow submerging of the printed word into a gray blur . Reading glasses ? Forget it . Next , people would be whispering : " She was a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could bring Darth Vader to life , where was the coffee ? She set the machine down . <p> And where were her Gitanes ? <p> Caffeine and cigarettes , the breakfast of champions for ballerinas , even long-retired ones . What started out decades ago as a six-packa-day Diet Coke habit had morphed into almost a case a day of highoctane diet Red Bull as her metabolism slowed . Cynthia was Sleeping Beauty without her fix . And to make matters worse , Esme , her personal maid , had hidden the cigs from her , instructed to ration five a day  --  7:30 , 10:30 , 2:30 , 6:30 , 10:30  --  unless otherwise notified in times of crisis . Cynthia knew better than to bother anyone about her blessed unfiltereds at this hour . <p> Cynthia looked past the custom Bonnet stove she 'd never used to the white Carrara marble countertop she 'd used once , for a photo spread . The Town &amp; Country layout had been featured several bright springs ago  --  Cynthia sitting sideways on the cold marble , her black mane freshly blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent laughter ( behold the bliss of the wealthy Upper East Side wife , the inside joke of the Park Avenue Princess ) . She could see her dancer 's torso curved backward , one long leg emerging from the slit in her Armani , ending days later in the arch of her bare foot . The caption : " Cynthia Power , patroness of the New York Ballet Theater , feels as at home in her Baron Waxfield-designed kitchen as onstage in a pas de deux . " <p> Cynthia the Perfectionist was known for being meticulous in her performances , onstage and off . Case in point : last night 's pas de deux t the Waldorf . Two years to plan her twenty-fifth wedding anniversary party and it was over in four hours . But what a four hours : five hundred of their closest and dearest , including the mayor , the governor , Barbara , Julian , Peter , Anna , Donald , the De Niros , Marc , Harvey , Rupert , Charlie , Woody , Diane , Liz , Nieporent , and the Schwarzmans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north side of Fifty-first Street . Once inside , they were ushered into a ballroom , completely overhauled in homage to Versailles 's Hall of Mirrors . Gargantuan reflective panes had been installed on one side ; faux " windows " had been painted on the facing wall to replicate the intricate gardens . There were twinkling chandeliers and a ceiling painstakingly repainted as per the Sun King 's original specifications . There was consensus among the people who mattered : New York had n't seen a party like this since the Steinberg-Tisch wedding/merger at the Met back in the eighties . <p> If only her husband , Jackson Xavier Power , had seen fit to show up on time . <p> " Now what ? " she asked herself . She had a full two hours before her Pilates instructor rang , but without a schedule and without her Red Bull , she was n't sure exactly what to do . She could boot up her social calendar for the upcoming fall season or go through last season 's closet and decide which dresses to donate to charity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the newspapers . Excited about getting the papers  --  this was her life . Cynthia did n't fear running into anyone in the elevators at 740  --  they were perpetually mpty . Still , she decided to take the stairs . The eighteen-room apartment ( six bedrooms , eight baths ) commanded the penthouse of the eventeen-story limestone building , a trek , but Cynthia needed to get her blood moving . She cinched the robe tightly around her waist and walked out the service door into the darkened hallway . <p> Five minutes later , Cynthia was back in the kitchen , the Post spread open on the Pedini island . Her reflection hovered at its edges  --  forehead pinched , cheeks flushed , mouth agape . She played a game with herself , shutting her eyes , then forcing them open again . The photo remained unchanged . <p> Screw the Red Bull . Sleeping Beauty was wide awake . <p> Copyright 2009 by Last Punch Productions , Inc . <br> Continues ...                @ @ @ @ @
