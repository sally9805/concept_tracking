The Breakdown Lane LP Chapter One Genesis Excess Baggage by J. A. Gillis The Sheboygan News-Clarion Dear J. , I 'm getting married next summer , to a man of another nationality . Both families are very happy , but there is a problem . His many female relatives  --  aunts , grandmothers , and sisters  --  must sit in the front row , as is their right . As descendants of the Masai in Africa , they are very tall . My family is Japanese-American . We are small  --  in number and in size . My father is only five feet four , my sisters less than five feet . The wedding will take place in a hotel ballroom with chairs set up in rows . We did not want to have a " bride 's " side and a " groom 's " side , because we want this to be a true blending of families . However , I know that the women in my fianc 's family are going to wear large , decorative hats ( I do n't mean ceremonial headdresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what my fianc refers to as " church-lady " hats , which are the size of our wedding cake ) . This will make them even taller , and so no one except my mother and father will be able to see me during the ceremony . I do n't want to suggest that they " move to the back of the bus " for my family . So how can we avoid slighting anyone on our special day ? Given the disparity of heights , the wedding dance will also be very awkward . Nervous in Knudson Dear Nervous , This is a matter of some sensitivity , since tensions on a wedding day can leave a bitter taste that can linger for years . But nerves ? You 've already probably got the once-in-a-lifetime jitters every bride endures . Do n't add this small opportunity for creativity to your checklist of stress . With the same joy of life you 've already demonstrated by your beautifully bold choice to mingle cultures , craft a circle of joy . Ask the staff at the hotel to place the wedding chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal members of both families and the rest of the chairs in staggered rows behind , so that each person , regardless of heights , will enjoy a wonderful view . Guests will be escorted through a small opening , the same place your groom will enter with his parents , a few moments before you enter with yours . Make the altar or other ceremonial platform in the center " a round , " also  --  perhaps exchanging your vows facing in one direction , conducting the ceremonies of rings or candles facing the other , with the transitions gracefully made to instrumental music or song . As for the dance ! No one feels awkward at such a happy affair ! Think of all the aunts and grandmas you 've seen dancing the polka in groups of five ! J. Let 's begin at the end of the beginning . The first moment of the second act of our lives . It was ballet class . It was the second class of the week , made up of dance combinations and mat Pilates . Steady on the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember that , a wonderful feeling . I was spent , but pleasurably , my hips not so much aching as aware they 'd been asked for something strenuous . This class , and my weight training were the times during my week I felt freed from strain , just shy of pure . I extended my right leg along the floor in its customary turnout  --  posturally correct , erect on my sitz bones , a little bit smug , but trying not to glance around me to observe that other women , even younger women , noticed the way my flexibility still came easily  --  and leaned forward for the hamstring stretch . What I saw when I looked down horrified me so much that my mind scrabbled away from me , across the birchy floor . What was it ? Numb shard of bone ? Foot clawed birdlike , in spasm ? Worse . It was ... nothing . Nothing was different than what I 'd seen when I sat down five seconds earlier . It was only my leg , my ordinary leg in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest daughter used to call my " mermaid clothes " ) still bent in a forty-five-degree angle at the knee , my pointed toe nestled against my thigh . Does n't sound like much , does it ? You have a right to expect more of terrors . Sharp , single shriek on a silent street . Pea-sized lump your finger grazes as you soap your breast . Tang of smoke in the still air , footsteps ' rhythm matching your own , in the dusk of an empty parking lot . A shadow that jumps against a wall in a room in which you know you are alone . But think ! A thing so huge it will dismember your world can be invisible . It can be a germ . A scent . It can be an absence . You see , I had felt my leg open smoothly , like a knife with a well-balanced mechanism . But it had not . A cascade of thoughts , like the fountain from a child 's sparkler , showered over me : the phantom limb phenomenon , the precursor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My first instinct was to scream . Instead , like any sane person , I tried again . My leg refused . Metallic , icy sweat burst from my pores , bathing my face and neck , painting gleaming half-moons under my breasts . I dampened like a true mermaid in my " mermaid 's clothes . " From the corner of my eye , I glanced at my friend , Cathy , who took the class with me , as her arms branched and she arched down over her own leg . Her eyes , closed in concentration , suddenly flipped up , like one of those old venetian blinds , as if she 'd heard a crack , a clap , as if I truly had screamed . She looked at me , quizzically , one eyebrow a beckoning finger . I grinned ...
