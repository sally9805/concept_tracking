All men tend to produce less of the male hormone testosterone as they grow older , but some men produce less than others , which is why there was so much interest  --  and concern  --  last week about a new study that showed that older men with particularly low levels of testosterone circulating in their blood may be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer 's disease . Other studies have shown that testosterone improves performance on cognitive tests , but this is the first to suggest that low levels of circulating testosterone may provide a warning  --  as much as a decade in advance  --  that a man will develop Alzheimer 's . <P> The study , published in the journal Neurology , tracked the testosterone levels in 574 men ages 32 to 87 . After 19 years , about 1 in 10 had been diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease . Although testosterone levels were down across the board , they fell precipitously in the men who developed Alzheimer 's , to about half the levels of the men who did not develop the disease .

About 800,000 American men take prescription testosterone , in some cases to treat hypogonadism ( abnormally low testosterone levels ) , in others to boost normal testosterone levels in hopes of increasing muscle mass or athletic performance . <P> Most doctors , acutely aware of the problems female hormone-replacement therapy caused for women , are cautious about advising anyone to take testosterone supplements  --  even to ward off Alzheimer 's . While the pros are still being worked out , the cons are real and troubling . Resnick is convinced that testosterone supplements can increase your risk of prostate cancer and stroke , despite a report in the New England Journal of Medicine last week suggesting that the studies were not large enough to say for sure . Furthermore , the ideal levels of testosterone still need to be worked out . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Resnick , no matter how bad his memory is . <P> One last word of warning : do n't try getting around your doctor by buying testosterone on the Internet . A lot of products sold on the Net claim to contain testosterone-like substances , but for the real deal , you need a prescription . <P> Dr. Gupta is a neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent
