This was a revolutionary week in American sport . One of our major leagues finally managed to make it past 1919 . This happened when the National Basketball Association allowed its women 's league to relocate a failed franchise to a casino , the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut . // Naturally , this brought on crocodile tears and breast-beating from sanctimonious moralists across the land . Oh , the shame of it : impressionable professional athletes actually playing under the same roof as the reprobates who crank slot machines ! Last week a doomsaying New York Times columnist lamented that such a pernicious step was the " worst news under the sun . " // The Times also does n't see fit to print the news known as point spreads , on the Tagliabuean theory that sports fans can not deal with the hard truth . It was NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue , of course , who refused to allow commercials for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority that would have appeared on the Super Bowl telecast . The decision was so absurd it did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just came off as small and clueless. // It is also true that the NBA commissioner , David Stern , has been just as childish in the past . He would n't permit a franchise for Toronto until NBA games were taken off sports books in Ontario . And baseball is historically hysterical on the subject of gambling . The defiantly coarse personality of Pete Rose has obscured the larger truth , that the penalty against him for wagering on baseball has been absolutely draconian . // Is it even unsuitable to bet on your own self ? Illicit , perhaps , in Rose 's case , but jockeys are permitted to do it , and we find it reassuring that an athlete cares so much . In any case , it is hardly a universal taboo and it is often an accepted part of the competition . Golf would go the way of quoits if there were n't Nassaus . For American sports leagues to stretch to outlandish lengths to pretend to insulate themselves from the make-believe evils of gambling is transparent and puerile. // The straw man is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixers are everywhere , ready to lure well-paid professionals into throwing games . Once , in a distant era , yes , this was common  --  and not only with the Black Sox . But has there been serious talk of a fixed baseball game in the past 80 years ? The last known serious attempt to fix an NFL game was in 1946 , and it failed . The NBA did suffer Jack Molinas , a singular Lucifer of an athlete , but he was banned half a century ago . The odds ( excuse me ) of anybody pulling off a fix now in a major league game are off the board ( beg your pardon ) . As a point of fact , the diligence of the books in Vegas themselves serve more to protect sport than to menace it . Sports commissioners worrying about fixed games is like President Bush fearing an attack by the Barbary pirates . // Drugs threaten the integrity of our sports . Booze and babes will periodically affect performance . But gambling today is a by-product of pro sport , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major leagues to carry on with policies as if the same economic situations and temptations exist as they did back when the indigent Black Sox took a dive . // Good for the grown-ups at the NBA . And , as for the new Connecticut Suns of the WNBA , may they hit the jackpot , make their point , double down and beat the dealer  --  and all the righteous bluenoses , too .
