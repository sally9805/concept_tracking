Naples , Italy  --  1876 <p> What is the opposite of dTja vu ? <p> Louisa Clemens stopped in consternation barely a few paces into the parlor . The room felt peculiarly different , as if she had never set foot in it before . After working six years for the Winterbottoms , she knew every inch of their parlor  --  the blue carpet patterned with roses , the chintz-covered sofas , the ormolu clock on the mantel , and the glass case full of ferns in the corner of the bay window  --  yet she felt as if she had never been there before . <p> Plastering a fatade of normality over her sudden feeling of strangeness , something different caught Louisa 's eye , and she turned her head toward the side of the room where a man stood unabashedly staring at her . He was definitely not the sort of man she would expect to see in the Winterbottoms ' parlor , ensconced among all their other guests . She faltered once again , the sensation of foreignness overcoming her . <p> It was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gaze that seemed to search out all her secrets and leave nothing hidden . They were dark gray , the color of cold English skies and frozen cobblestones , with only the barest hint of the deep , mysterious ink of midnight . <p> The rest of the company assembled in the room may just as well have been invisible for all the notice Louisa could spare them . Next to him , everyone else seemed utterly insignificant . He was a tempest , a hurricane , a force so powerful that it slammed against her chest until she could hardly draw a breath . Against a nature as strong as his , she would have no chance of resistance . <p> That was why the room had seemed so strange to her  --  because he was in it . His mere presence had transformed the Winterbottoms ' parlor into a room of mystery , a place Louisa no longer recognized . <p> She shivered in her light cotton gown , drew her Indian shawl closely around her shoulders , and turned her head away from danger , continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though she could no longer see him , Louisa could feel the force of his gaze on her , stripping her bare . She knew that she had all of his attention . Everything about him was focused on her , and only on her . <p> " Ah , Miss Clemens , there you are . " Mrs. Winterbottom bustled cheerfully toward Louisa , her mahogany ringlets bouncing under her cap . " I was just telling our guests about my little cherubs and here you are with them both . You have impeccable timing . " <p> Though still shaken by the peculiar feeling that lingered in her spine and the directness of the stranger 's gaze , Louisa smiled perfunctorily at her employer . " Prudence , Hester , " she said gently to the two identical twin girls who trotted at her side , " make a curtsy for your mama . " <p> The girls did as they were bid , holding out their puffed skirts and sinking into a pretty curtsy , all the while sneaking wide-eyed peeks at the guests , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised at their curiosity . Even in this urbane and sophisticated household , where businessmen from many parts of the world visited Mr. Winterbottom , a guest like this was most unusual . <p> She sneaked a look at him herself out of the corner of her eye , not wishing to be caught by his gaze again , or to let him guess her interest . Everything about him was different . For a start , his skin was tanned to a deep brown , even far darker than the Italians among whom they lived . His high cheekbones lent his face a severe grace , and his hair fell in thick , black waves nearly to his shoulders instead of being neatly pomaded to sit flat against his head , the style preferred by most gentlemen . <p> His clothing was as unusual as his looks . Though his navy blue jacket was cut in the usual style , it was richly decorated with heavy gold and red embroidery , and his trousers were pristine white rather than the more usual black . He wore a round , red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear even more exotic , while all the other men in the room were bareheaded , having removed their hats upon coming inside . He stood out among the crowd of Europeans as a wild hawk would stand out in a farmyard full of domesticated chickens . <p> The girls had dipped into a low curtsy . " Good girls , " Mrs. Winterbottom said approvingly as they straightened up again . " Now then , come and hug your mama . " <p> The pair obediently suffered a hug from their mother without undue wriggling . Inwardly , Louisa breathed a sigh of relief . Mrs. Winterbottom was a kindhearted woman and possessed the best of tempers , but the one thing she hated above all else was having her fine silk dress ruffled  --  particularly when she was in the company of handsome guests , as she was this evening . <p> There was no denying that the man who had caught Louisa 's attention was handsome in an exotic way . He was much more attractive than the pallid young Englishman with ginger sideburns paying court to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the dark-haired and debonair Italian count flirting outrageously with the elderly  --  and terribly wealthy  --  dowager in the corner . <p> Louisa glanced over at Mr. Winterbottom as he poured sherry at the sideboard . Next to the visitor , even Mr. Winterbottom looked pale and uninteresting . She noticed for the first time that his hairline was starting to recede and that , despite his firmly buttoned waistcoat , good living had given him a slight paunch . In contrast , the stranger looked to be all hard muscle with barely an ounce of fat on him , strong and untamed , and quite out of place in this quiet , gentile setting . <p> Seeming quite unperturbed by the dangerous allure that hung about the stranger like a miasma , Mrs. Winterbottom guided her daughters toward him . " Come , my dears , make a curtsy to our guests , especially to Mr. Khair , who has come all the way from Morocco to meet you . " <p> <br> Continues ...               @ @ @ @ @ @
