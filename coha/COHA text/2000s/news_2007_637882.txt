<p> Do n't call them time-shares . <p> To be sure , the " enchanting vineyard residences " in Napa are being sold on a slice-and-dice basis . The 17 private cottages will be sold to 170 different buyers via a method called fractional ownership . Each buyer gets a guaranteed chunk of time every year . <p> But the Orchard at Carneros Inn says it is worlds apart from the vacation business model notorious for being marketed by motormouth sales reps . <p> It 's swanky , not sleazy . It 's really real estate . And at $275,000 a slice ( the " founding owner " price ) plus annual dues of $8,100 , it 's unabashedly for rich folks . <p> Fractional ownership is the latest twist in luxury vacation homes . Some 250 high-end properties in the United States , Canada and the Caribbean , in desirable destinations such as Aspen and Vail , Colo. ; Maui ; and New York , offer fractional ownership . Marriott , Disney , Hyatt , Ritz-Carlton , Four Seasons and Starwood are among the big companies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the time-share revolution , " said Reed Anderson , director of sales for the Orchard . But he is careful to distinguish between the two concepts and only winces slightly when his luxury real estate is besmirched with the far-less-classy term . <p> " I do n't get angry anymore when people call them time-shares , " Anderson said . <p> In San Francisco , the Ritz-Carlton and the Fairmont at Ghirardelli are developing fractional-ownership residences , set to open in November and next spring , respectively . A few already exist in the Wine Country , such the Calistoga Ranch just outside Calistoga and Mayacama in Santa Rosa . <p> The fractional-ownership concept works for all sorts of jet-set perks like , well , jets . There are companies offering fractional ownership of yachts , helicopters , race horses , wineries , exotic cars , stadium skyboxes , even designer handbags . <p> Fractional-ownership properties , also called residence clubs , often are built alongside a resort . When they 're in residence , the owners get to use all the resort 's perks , such as concierge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the case with the Orchard . <p> It 's on the grounds of the Carneros Inn , a 27-acre rustic resort nestled among Napa 's rolling vineyards . Carneros has 86 guest cottages , 24 million-dollar homes , three gourmet restaurants , a spa , pools , a fitness center , boutiques and a deli . The resort has a village feel , enhanced by having its own post office . Ironically , for a place where the very breeze seems to murmur " money , " the property was originally a mobile-home park , and the guest cottages were placed according to the same plan as the doublewides . <p> The Orchard cottages will have their own concierge and manager , as well as access to all the Carneros amenities , Anderson said . <p> Carneros is managed by the PlumpJack wine , restaurant and real estate empire started by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom . The mayor has divested himself of PlumpJack businesses in San Francisco but still owns stakes in its enterprises outside the city . He does not have any involvement in Carneros , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner of the PlumpJack Group . <p> Like Carneros , the Orchard component is " agricultural chic "  --  low-key , especially on the outside , where the cottages look like humble bungalows . <p> The two-bedroom , two-bathroom cottages are furnished simply but with top-notch amenities , such as large-screen , flat-panel TVs , DVD/CD players , and stainless steel appliances in the fully equipped kitchens . The limestone floors in the bathrooms are heated . Indoor-outdoor flow is a part of their appeal ; each comes with a screened-in porch and a private outdoor patio with a hot tub and garden . Carneros said each cottage is 1,750 square feet , including the private outdoor areas . The indoor living space is 1,250 square feet . <p> Owners ca n't leave their personal belongings in the cottages , but the property offers two storage bins for each owner , large enough for a couple of suitcases . <p> The first six cottages will be ready in August ; the remaining ones will be finished in November . <p> Fractional owners at the Orchard get a guaranteed three weeks every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on availability . <p> Owners may rent out their three-week slots if they desire . The Orchard cottages are likely to fetch $1,200 to $1,800 a night , depending on the season , Anderson said . The going rate for the much smaller Carneros guest cottages is more than $500 a night , while its two-bedroom suites ( which are smaller than the Orchard cottages and do not have full kitchens ) go for $1,200 . <p> The $275,000 price will be available to the first 34 of the anticipated 170 buyers . In addition , owners pay $8,100 in dues per year , plus annual property tax of about 1 percent of their purchase price . <p> " Most people pay cash , ( although ) we have financing available , " Anderson said . <p> All-cash purchases are common for the types of folks who can afford fractional ownership  --  and that 's just as well , because few banks offer financing options for them , according to Jamie Cheng , co-founder of San Francisco 's Helium Report ( www.heliumreport.com ) , an online resource for people interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate purchase , most people do n't do it to build equity . The concept is still so new that the resale market has n't developed enough to judge how well fractional-ownership properties tend to appreciate . <p> " People do n't buy this as an investment ; they buy it as a lifestyle purchase , " Anderson said . <p> That almost exactly echoed advice from Cheng . <p> " Our recommendation is to consider this not as a real estate investment , but as a long-term lifestyle investment , " Cheng said . " You pay fairly premium annual dues , but you get a significant amount of luxury services back . In time-shares , it 's all around selling it up front ; once they sell it , they leave the sales office , run away and you 're on your own . " <p> Other key distinctions between fractional ownership and time-shares : <p>  --  Ownership structure : With fractional ownership , buyers get deeded real estate , which they own forever or until they sell it . Time-shares generally are contracts for some period of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time-shares are not real estate , Anderson said ; they are leases . <p>  --  Time flexibility : With fractional ownership , owners can choose their visits according to a rotating priority system so each one gets a shot at coveted slots , such as the winter holidays . With time-shares , you 're stuck with the same time block every year ; say , the first week in July , unless you find someone who agrees to trade . Also , fractional ownership usually involves fewer owners and thus longer ( or more ) time blocks . <p>  --  Resale : This is key  --  and still up in the air . Time-shares got tarnished in many people 's eyes when it turned out that they could only be unloaded for far less than the original purchase price . Fractional ownership holds out the lure of a stronger resale market because it involves deeded real estate  --  although folks at the Orchard were n't willing to go on the record about resale possibilities . <p>  --  Trading properties : Another rap for time-shares came when owners found it difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are owned by major chains like Fairmont and Ritz-Carlton usually offer an option to arrange reciprocal use at other destinations in the chain . Independent fractional properties like the Orchard can join forces with chains to offer reciprocal use . " We have not ( done that ) as of yet , " Anderson said . " We are looking at our options there . " <p> Fractional ownership " is often an alternative to a second home , but it also can be an addition to a second home , " Cheng said . " You see people who have a pied-a-terre in San Francisco , a cabin in Tahoe ; they 're looking for ways to supplement their vacation travel . Fractional presents an alternative . Rather than own a whole unit , make smarter use of your money : Buy a fraction and get five-star service .
