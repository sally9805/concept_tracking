If there is one food I would recommend that my patients eat every day , it is blueberries . Not only do blueberries taste great , but they have well-documented antioxidant powers , which is probably why they seem to help ward off Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases . I also encourage people to eat vine-ripened tomatoes and citrus fruits , because they have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancers of the prostate and colon . <P> The only problem with these health-promoting summer fruits and vegetables is that when summer is over , many grocery stores either stop carrying them or start overcharging for substandard , out-of-season fare . <P> So what do you eat after the local blueberries are gone ? I did a little research last week , when autumn officially began , and found that filling the summer-blueberry void is easier than I expected . Fall , after all , is a season of vibrant colors , and that turns out to be just what you want in a fruit or vegetable . As a rule of thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dietetic Association , the more colorful the produce the better it is for you . " A fruit or vegetable with a lot of pigment is actually very rich in antioxidants , " says Zanecosky , pointing to the deep greens , dark yellows and vibrant oranges that fill the fruit and vegetable section of supermarkets each autumn . <P> Apples , cranberries , pumpkins and squashes are some of the season 's most powerful foods . Apples contain flavanoids , some of the most potent antioxidants known . Several studies have shown that people who eat a diet rich in flavanoids have a lower risk of heart disease and heart attacks as well as several types of cancer . Pumpkins , those quintessential autumn vegetables , are much more than Halloween decorations . Pumpkins and other orange-colored fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamin C , vitamin A , folate and carotenoids . Carotenoids , such as beta-carotene , are excellent cancer-prevention compounds . Yellow and orange squashes are rich in vitamins A and C , potassium and fiber . Squashes , like pumpkins , are good sources of carotenoids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall , cranberries contain the same heart-healthy condensed tannins found in tea and red wine . <P> Of course , it 's possible to get off-season fruits in many supermarkets these days , if you are willing to pay for imported , frozen or canned varieties . While having these options can be useful if you need to diversify your diet , it 's generally best to buy fruit and vegetables grown locally and in season . " There is always going to be a benefit to something seasonal , " says registered dietician Julie Walsh of the American Dietetic Association . The nutrients in plants actually change with the seasons , and many fruits and vegetables lose potency if eaten past their prime . <P> The body uses the same nutrients all year round , but it has special needsin autumn . The shorter days and colder weather make people less active , which is why it 's all the more important to eata healthy and balanced diet.The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends five ormore servings of fruits and vegetables a day  --  even if they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gajilan/New York <P> Dr. Gupta is a neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent
