prologue <p> Luanne Richard opened the door to her killer wearing a smile and little else . With a drink in one hand and invitation and mischief dancing in her eyes , she sensed no danger . After several martinis , her instinct for danger was hazy at best . <p> She 'd been lounging on the patio in her bikini when the doorbell rang . It had occurred to her that a cover-up might be the proper thing , but she was n't much into doing the proper thing . Never had been . It got really boring trying to live life properly . Now , glancing through the peephole , she saw he was alone and thought it might be fun to tease him a little . No one around , as far as she could tell . So she let him in , closed the door , and turned to face him . <p> That is when she saw the knife . <p> She sobered instantly . And when he raised it and lunged , aiming for her throat , she recoiled on instinct alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculously  --  managed to evade that first vicious slash . While he cursed and blinked gin from his eyes , she turned and ran on bare feet . <p> She raced through the huge house wondering frantically how to escape . She cursed her carelessness in leaving the gate open when she drove home from the club . It came to her that she stood no chance while inside , so she flew through the living room and made for the den and beyond  --  the patio . She prayed the door was open , that she 'd failed to close it when she got up and came back in . <p> Please , oh , please ... <p> Halfway there , she took a quick look over her shoulder and screamed . He was close and gaining . He would be on her if she did n't do something . As she streaked past a very expensive Chinese vase , she gave it a push to tip it over , thinking to trip him . He stumbled but did n't go down . He picked it up , tossed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be real . This kind of craziness happened in nightmares to other people , not to her . Had n't she had enough grief in her life ? Had n't she tried her best to fight the demons that tormented her ? Had n't she often resisted temptation ? Was she to be damned for the times she did n't ? <p> I 'm sorry , God . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry ... <p> No ! She was n't going to let this happen . She had a lot of life to live yet . She would change . She had changed . Nobody understood how hard it was for her to keep to the straight and narrow . She kept to the path . Almost always . <p> Once out on the lawn , she realized she could n't make it to the front . It was too far away . He 'd overtake her before she got halfway there . And there was no time to punch in the security code to open the gate . She was trapped . <p> Mad with fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led to the pier and boathouse . She veered to avoid the cherub fountain and stumbled , twisting her ankle painfully . She flung out a hand for balance only to have it slashed on the lethal thorns of a pyracantha . Sobbing now , she dashed through a grove of wax myrtles , wincing at the slap and sting of limbs before finally reaching the pier jutting over the bayou . It was her only chance . <p> She looked again over her shoulder . He 'd slowed , knowing she had no place else to run . The knife blade glinted brightly in the sun . She whimpered , trying to think . Blood dripped from the gash on her hand and her ankle throbbed . Scalding tears ran down her cheeks . What to do ? <p> " Gotcha now , Luanne , " he taunted . " The boathouse or the bayou , babe . What 's it gon na be ? " <p> Not the bayou . Never the bayou . <p> She had a fear of Blood Bayou . It had almost claimed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held any charm for her . The water was too dark , too still , too deep , too alive with slimy things , predatory things . The bayou was death . <p> She was out of breath and in pain when she remembered the telephone in the boathouse only a few feet away . Checking behind her , she saw that he was still coming , but moving almost leisurely , as if enjoying the chase , savoring her fear . Anticipating the kill ? <p> The thought made her leap onto the pier . Hot from the August sun , the wooden planks burned the soles of her bare feet . Below the pier , black water slapped against the pilings , disorienting her . Do n't look down ! Eyes straight ahead , she finally reached the boathouse door , grabbing at the latch , fingers clawing . Panic and blood from her wounded hand made her clumsy , all thumbs , as she worked at the strange fastener . But at last she got it , wrenched it open . <p> Inside it was dark and dank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decaying fish . But it was sanctuary and she scrambled inside , slammed the door shut , and set the bolt . It would not keep him out for long , but it offered a few precious seconds . Her eyes struggled with the dark . It was her only chance . But one thing nagged : Why was he giving her this chance ? No time to worry about that . She flew to the wall-mounted phone , grabbed the receiver , and punched in 911 . <p> He was at the boathouse now , rattling the door . Terror leaped in her chest . With her heart in her throat , she strained to hear the ring connecting her to 911 . But nothing . In a panic , she jiggled the button up and down . Listened for a dial tone . Nothing . She frantically pressed the button up and down again . And again nothing . She gave an anguished cry and slammed the receiver against the wall . The phone line was dead ! <p> She screamed at the thunderous crash . He kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking the boathouse to its foundation . As she watched , petrified , he took an unhurried step inside , filling the doorway . With the sun behind him , he loomed as large as a truck . He paused , no doubt to let his eyes adjust to the dark interior . He took his time . Then he began to move slowly toward her . " I 've got you now , sugar , " he taunted , his smile grotesque . <p> Incoherent with terror , all she saw was the knife . She scrambled backward , desperate to get out of his reach . But he kept coming . With a bump , she backed against the sleek hull of a boat . Trapped ! Below was bottomless , black water . Sobbing , she looked at him piteously . She was going to die . The bayou was going to claim her after all . <p> Blood Bayou 2009 Karen Young <br> Continues ...
