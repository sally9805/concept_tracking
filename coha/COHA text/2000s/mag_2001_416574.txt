short story Headnote Rosemary and I had been through so much , I thought our friendship would go on forever . Then my daughter broke her son 's heart ... By Isobel Stewart Photograph // IT WAS WHAT WE HAD LONGED FOR , ROSEMARY AND I. OH , WE 'D LAUGHED AT ourselves through the years , and agreed it was a foolish thought . Her Rick and my Lucy . Babies , sitting on the grass , looking at each other soberly , appraisingly . Toddlers , playing in the sandbox together . Eight-year-olds scorning each other . Teenagers  --  Lucy with braces , Rick suddenly lanky , his voice breaking  --  and cautiously friendly . Rick saying gruffly to his mother that he and Lucy might as well go to the school dance together . And Lucy telling me that all the boys she knew were so hopeless , but Rick was OK . And Rosemary and I , through all that time , saying to each other : " Would n't it be lovely if they ... " Telling each other firmly that you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even think of it . " But do n't you wish we lived in India , Beth , so we could just arrange a marriage ? " Rosemary had said once , and we laughed . We always laughed so much , Rosemary and I ; we had such fun together , from the time we met in the maternity ward , when Rick was three days old , and Lucy only a few hours old . When they shared a first birthday party , we said maybe we 'd be smart enough to have our second babies at the same time too . But it did n't work out that way . My son , Thomas , was born when Lucy was two , but Rosemary did n't have any more children . " Just lost the secret , " she 'd said lightly . But her smile did n't quite reach her eyes . For a moment , I put my hand over hers , not saying anything . As the years went by , our friendship deepened . Fortunately , our husbands got along too . There vacations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , family birthdays , holiday dinners . And the fantasy we shared , Rosemary and I , smiling at our own foolishness , but still dreaming . When Lucy was 19 , she entered a nursing program , and Rick began college , studying to be a lawyer . They were both still living in our town and seeing each other when their schedules allowed . Rosemary and I had both gone back to work- I was teaching ; she was a junior partner in an architectural firm . We saw each other when we could , meeting for lunch or a Saturday shopping excursion . Then , on Lucy 's twenty-second birthday , she and Rick came to us , hand in hand . Rosemary and David were having dinner at our house . " We 're engaged , " Lucy announced . " Look . " It was an old-fashioned ring , a gold band with three tiny diamonds . They 'd bought it in a secondhand store , they said , because it was all they could afford . " And it will be ages before we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the world to know that Lucy is my girl . " " I 've been your girl from the day you emptied a bucket of sand over my head , and I let you do it , " Lucy told him , and kissed him . We were all so happy that night . Rosemary and I hugged each other , not sure whether we were laughing or crying . Later , making coffee in the kitchen , we wondered if our first grandchild would be a boy or a girl . LOOKING BACK ON THE MONTHS THAT followed , I wonder why I did n't notice that Lucy was unhappy until Steve pointed it out . I was busy at work , I guess , and nursing Thomas through a bout of mononucleosis that had brought him out of the college dorm and back to his old room for a couple of weeks . Steve went away a few times , too , traveling on business . Perhaps it was being gone that made him see things more clearly . " Is Lucy all right ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the hospital with us . " She does n't seem to have her usual sparkle . " I immediately assumed it was fatigue  --  Lucy worked so hard  --  but when I thought about it more , I realized Steve was right . She had been a bit quiet , subdued . " No , nothing 's wrong , Mom , " she told me when we spoke on the phone a few days later . " I 'm fine , really . " Then she teased me about being a worrier , and her voice was bright . I 'm ashamed to say that any concern about Lucy went out of my head . Because , of course , she was all right . She was doing work she loved , even if it was demanding , and she was engaged to Rick , with plans for a wedding next year . A few weeks later , I came home from school with a pile of papers to mark in my arms , and went into the kitchen to find Lucy . " I thought you were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then , alarmed : " Lucy , honey , what is it ? " She was white , and there were dark shadows under her eyes . Wordlessly , she held out her left hand to me . I saw the bare finger , where Rick 's engagement ring had been . I put my arms around her . She began to cry , silently , tears running down her cheeks . I held her close , shocked , bewildered , unable to do anything except hold her . After a long time , she drew back and took a tissue from the box on the kitchen counter . " I 've told Rick I ca n't marry him , " she said quietly , sadly . " I 've ... I 've met someone else . A doctor , a pediatrician . His name is Matthew , and  --  Oh , Mom , I did n't want it to happen , but  --  I did n't know . I thought what Rick and I had was great . I thought we 'd get married , have children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what real love is . " She clasped her hands together , rubbing them , as if she were cold , so cold she could n't get warm . " It 's like we 're a part of each other , Matthew and I , " she said , slowly . " Like we 've been waiting all our lives to find each other . " I was afraid of saying the wrong thing , but I had to say something . " Lucy , maybe you and Rick are so used to each other , so comfortable , that this young doctor has swept you off your feet , and it 's temporary . He 's probably handsome and exciting  --  " She shook her head and tried to smile . " Rick is much better-looking , " she said . " And there is n't much that 's exciting about a tired , overworked man . " She took my hands in hers . " Mom , this is n't a sudden thing . Matthew and I have been working together for months . We 've tried to pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any longer . " She had told Rick weeks ago that perhaps their engagement was a mistake , but she had n't told him about Matthew , not then . " Rick was n't hearing me , " she said . " He said everything would be fine . When I finally told him there was else , he said let 's not do anything drastic , let 's give it time . I know he thought I 'd come to my senses and somehow things would work out . But last night I told him I could n't marry him , and I gave him back his ring . " She was crying again . " This is the worst thing I 've done in my life , Mom , " she said . " Hurting Rick and you and Dad and Rick 's folks . But I have to do it . " I felt so bad that she 'd been unhappy all this time and I had n't seen it . Not that I could have done anything except be there for her . After she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat for a long time trying to come to terms with what had happened . I knew how Steve would react , and he did , that night , when I told him . " Better now than after they 're married , " he said . " Lucy is n't doing this lightly . We know our Lucy ; she 's sensible and responsible , and we have to accept her decision . " He leaned forward and dried my eyes with his big handkerchief . " Have you talked to Rosemary yet ? " I told him she was out of town for a few days , on a new shopping mall contract . " We were so happy about Rick and Lucy , " I said shakily . " We .. we thought we 'd be grandmothers together . " " She 'll understand , " Steve said . " Look , we 're all sorry , but Lucy is old enough to know her own mind . Rosemary will understand that . " Ofcourse , she would , I told myself She 'd be very sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had , that Lucy had to do this . I did n't know when she would be home , and I planned on phoning her over the weekend . But before I could , she called me . " Beth ? Rosemary here . " " Oh , Rosemary , " I said . " We 're all so sorry . How is Rick ? " And without giving her time to answer : " Now that I know you 're home , I 'm coming over . I 'll be there in ten minutes . We can talk  --  " You would n't think you could pick up anything in a silence over the phone , but I did . " Rosemary ? " I said uncertainly . " I do n't think that would be a good idea , " she said carefully . " Rick is here , and I doubt he would want to see you . And right now , I feel the same . That 's why I 'm phoning , to tell you that . And do n't say sorry  --  it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , so did I. I saw my hand was shaking . " Give her time , " Steve said that night . " She 's feeling hurt for Rick . " " But we 're friends , " I said , bewildered , and I had to swallow before I could go on . " I 'm as sad and sorry as she is . We should be helping each other through this . " As Rosemary had helped me when my dad died . As I had helped her when her sister was in a bad car accident . We 'd always been there for each other . " Give her time , " Steve said again , gently . " And think how you would feel if some girl did this to Thomas . " " You 're probably right , " I said , and tried , not very successfully , to smile . " I 'd hate any girl who hurt Thomas . " Thomas himself was upset by the breakup  --  Rick had been like a big brother to him all his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say to him ? " I asked , for Rick had been cool when I 'd called him . All he 'd said to me was " Thanks for calling " and " Sorry , I 'm busy now . " " I said , Gee , Rick , I 'm sorry , I guess you 're feeling pretty low , but maybe we could have a beer together sometime , because I 'd hate for you and me not to be friends . " ' And that , I thought , summed up what I wanted to say to Rosemary . If she would only give me the chance . " What did Rick say ? " Thomas shrugged . " He said , Sure , sometime . " But if I did n't mind , not right now . I guess he needs time . " And then , awkwardly , " His mom is probably feeling the same . It 'll be all right , Mom . You 've been friends for so long , that counts for a lot . " Counts for a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for enough against my daughter breaking her son 's heart ? Because that 's what she said when we did meet . After a week , I phoned her , when I knew she 'd be home . I told her I was coming over , then hung up without giving her a chance to respond . As I got into the car , I heard the phone ringing , but I did n't go back . We never used the front doors at each other 's houses . We went around to the back , like family . But that day , Rosemary opened her front door . " You should n't have come , " she said flatly . " Rosemary , " I said , not quite steadily . " I 'm so sorry . We 're all so sorry . But I know we can help each other , like we have before ... " She stood at the door and did n't open it any farther . " Your daughter has broken my sons heart , " she said . " I do n't think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to go now . " " Rosemary , " I said , knowing desperate and uncaring . " Lucy did n't want this to happen , but when it did , she could n't go on pretending . That would n't have been fair to Rick . She said to me that Rick deserved more than second best . " Rosemary 's eyes were cool , steady . " But it was n't second best for Rick , " she said bleakly . " Only for Lucy . " I felt as if a giant hand were twisting my heart , so painfully that I could hardly breathe , but I had to go on trying . " She could n't help it , Rosemary , " I said . " Could n't she ? " She shrugged . " Well , I hope she 'll be happy with what she 's done . " She closed the door . did n't cry when I told Steve . I was beyond tears . But there was a tight knot of grief in my throat , and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Lucy 's sake , I smiled . I told her not to worry , we 'd sort things out , Rosemary and I. She just needed time . And for a while , I held on to that . Surely , someday , Rosemary would call . Or she 'd be at my kitchen door , and we would n't have to say anything . We 'd just look at each other and hug . But it did n't happen . I phoned Rosemary so many times . Her voice would be cool and .. hostile  --  there 's no other word for it . She did n't think we had anything to say to each other , she said , and would I mind just leaving things alone ? So eventually , I gave up . Once , we almost met in the supermarket , but she turned away . Lucy did n't ask us to meet Matthew for a few weeks , but when we did , I liked him . He was a sober young man , kind , concerned , and , I knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . They were n't going to get married right away , Lucy told me . They thought it would be better for everyone if they waited awhile . " But not too long , Mom , " Lucy said . " I want to be with Matthew when he comes home tired or sad because he 's lost a patient . I want us to share all the good and bad things in our lives . " I hugged her . " You just tell us when it 's going to happen , Lucy , and we 'll start making plans . I know you and Matthew want a quiet wedding , but we 'll see that it 's a special day . " She had stopped asking if I 'd seen Rosemary , and I was glad of that . I had done all I could , and now I put all the years of my friendship with Rosemary behind me , telling myself to move on . And I did . I met with colleagues at school , fellow teachers , for coffee . I agreed to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I liked these women and got on well with them , and in time , I thought , we might achieve the kind of friendship in which we knew each other so well that we did n't always have to spell things out . Soon I 'd be making plans for Lucy 's wedding , and I was looking forward to that . The more I saw of Matthew , the more I liked him , and the happier and more confident I felt that he and Lucy would be spending the rest of their lives together . When the phone rang one morning just before I was leaving for school , I thought it would be Lucy , telling me her next day off so we could arrange to sit down and start making plans . But it was n't Lucy . I listened , hardly taking in the words . Steve had been in an accident while driving to a meeting . He 'd been taken to the hospital . They would be operating immediately , to stabilize his condition . Coolly , practically , I phoned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I do n't remember driving to the hospital or parking . It was Lucy and Matthew 's hospital , the far end of it , the emergency area . Lucy was there , and I did n't question that . She told me later that the doctor on duty had realized his patient was Lucy 's father and had called her . Matthew had gone to get Thomas from school . " I want to see Steve , " I said . Lucy told me gently that he was already in surgery , and I could only see him later . And then , because I asked her how bad it was , and she could see that I needed the truth , she told me . There was internal damage , and they could n't tell how bad it was until they operated . " As soon as there 's any news , they 'll tell us , " she said , steadily . And I could see in her face the words she did n't say : one way or another . I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they both hugged me and Lucy . At some point , someone brought us coffee , and a little while after that Matthew 's pager beeped , and he had to go . Later , I told Lucy and Thomas that they should get something to eat . " You can go , Thomas , " Lucy said firmly , " and I 'll try to find out if there 's any news . " When they had gone , I leaned back and closed my eyes ; I was so tired and drained . " Beth . Oh , Beth . " I opened my eyes . Rosemary was there , sitting down beside me . She put her arms around me , not saying anything . After a long time , I drew back and looked at her . " How did you know ? " I asked her . " I went to school to see you . I knew you had a free period mid-morning , and the secretary told me . Is there any news ? " I shook my head . " Not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve was still in surgery . " Lucy has gone to see if there 's anything they can tell us . " Rosemary took my hand in hers . A few minutes later , Lucy returned . She hesitated when she saw Rosemary , then said there was no news . A short while later , Thomas came back , and the four of us sat , waiting . I do n't know how long it was before a big man in a green coat came in . He looked tired . But he was smiling . " Lucy , Mrs. Wilson , he 's going to be all right . We 'll watch him closely for a few days , keep him in intensive care , but he 'll be OK . " There was more that he said to Lucy , but I did n't take it all in . He used words like rupture , spleen , repair , recovery . Steve was going to be fine . Nothing else mattered . Lucy was allowed to take me to see him in a postsurgical ward . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was alive . " I 'll be back later , when you 're awake , " I told him softly . We returned to the waiting area , to Rosemary and Thomas . I told Thomas he should go back to his dorm , and I told Lucy she should go back to her work . " I 'll take your mother home , Lucy , " Rosemary said . For a moment , they looked at each other . Then Lucy smiled . " Thanks , " she said . And to me , " If you come back in a couple of hours , Dad will be surfacing enough to know you 're there . " Rosemary and I did n't speak on the way home . When we got there , she put on a pot of coffee and got out cups as if the months since she 'd last done this in my kitchen had never been . When we were taking our first sips of coffee , I thought of something . " You said you went to school to see me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rick said some time ago that he had to forgive Lucy . He had to move on , " she said quietly . " But I did n't find that easy to do . Then , lately , I got to thinking about Lucy . I 've known her all her life . I remembered how she was with that dove with the broken wing and with our old dog , Jake , when he was so ill . She would n't want to hurt Rick . " She was quiet then , and I waited . " And I 've decided she 's right , " she said . " Rick does deserve more than second best , and someday he 'll find it . So that 's why I went to see you , to tell you that . " She drank from her cup again , then set it down . " I 'll take you back to the hospital in a little while , " she said briskly . " Now , if you make up a shopping list , I can pick up some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A shopping list ? " I said blankly . " You 'll need things over the next few days , and you 'll want to spend as much time as possible with Steve , " Rosemary pointed out , and she handed me the pad I used for shopping . " You 're bossy , " I told her , not quite steadily . " Yes , I 'm bossy , " she agreed . Then , with a shake in her voice , she said , " I 've missed you , Beth . " " I 've missed you too , " I said . There would be this space , this sensitive place between us for a while , I knew . We 'd have to be careful , thoughtful . But in the end , it would be all right . We 'd still be friends , Rosemary and I. <p>
