In the winter , the men could be seen at dawn , walking out across the ice that circled Snow Island . They chopped holes in the surface and lowered their quahog tongs into the water , and brought up wire baskets filled with clams . Alice Daggett imagined she could see them now , still figures in the early light , breath leaving their bodies like steam . Once her father had taken her with him . She had held his hand tightly as they slipped over the ice . When he had pulled up the clams , she had grasped the end of the tongs with him , feeling his strength . The quahogs live all winter under the ice , he had told her . Alice had wondered if the sand where they burrowed was cold , and whether a clam could feel such things . This morning the men were out in boats , around the west side of the island , and Alice had a clear view from the end of the ferry dock . She had woken early even though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rain . Dangling her feet over the water , she watched as the sun inched into the sky . She was wearing only a sweater over her skirt and blouse for the first time that spring . Her bare legs felt deliciously naked in the warm air . When the sun cut a path across the water , Alice got to her feet and made her way down the dock . Owen Pierce was waiting on the porch of the store with an unlit pipe in his mouth . She climbed the steps and unlocked the padlock over the door . " You know quahogs can live longer than people , " Owen Pierce said . " That 's what the Indians said . Claimed quahogs could live more than a hundred years . " Alice pushed open the door and smiled . Owen Pierce was famous on the island for beginning conversations with this observation . He shuffled into the store after Alice and followed her to the counter . A bare bulb hung from the ceiling . Alice reached for the string attached to the bulb and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mew , emerging from the shelf where she slept in the back , pressed against cans of cleanser . She rubbed her head against Alice 's bare leg as she bent down to pet her . " Breakfast 's coming , " she said . Molly cocked her head as though she understood and leapt up next to the cash register . Owen rested both hands on the counter and breathed heavily . " I 'm ' bout out of tobacco . " Alice reached into the case beneath the cash register and removed a pouch of tobacco . Molly followed her movements , ears erect . " Mark that down now , " Owen said as he slipped the pouch in his shirt pocket . Alice opened the ledger and wrote the price in a long line of figures below Owen 's name , though she knew he would never pay for it . He leaned over the counter and squinted at the ledger . " I 'll be good for it come summer . " Alice nodded . " We 're getting a fair price for quahogs now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people come . I 'll be heading out soon , I expect . " Alice shut the ledger and rubbed the top of Molly 's head . At eighty-two , Owen was the oldest person on Snow . He kept up the fantasy , in his own mind that he still went out quahogging , though he had given it up in his seventies when his hands curled up with arthritis . In those awkward moments when it was clear even to Owen that he was not out on a quahog skiff , he would offer a quick excuse . " Ca n't work as long a day as I used to , you know . " Alice watched as he walked haltingly toward the chair by the stove . She thought of her father , who had always stopped to talk with Owen when they met on the road or down by his dock . Once her father told her that Owen Pierce knew more than anyone else on the island . " I did n't say he was smarter , mind you , but he knows more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the chair and puffed for a few moments , his legs stretched in front of him and feet crossed . " Rain finally stopped . Ground ai n't gon na dry out for planting for I do n't know how long . One year we did n't plant till after the first of June  --  the year of the ' 96 blizzard . That was a storm now . We had snow up to the roofs . Did n't get the roads cleared for a week . " He kept the pipe gripped between his brown teeth as he spoke , so the words were muffled . Alice knew most of his stories by heart anyway . She went to the stove and tossed in some bits of driftwood and wadded newspaper . There was enough coal left that it might catch . She lit a match and held it to the paper . It caught slowly , the edges curling . The cat mewed . " Alright , " Alice said . " We do n't get winters like that anymore , " Owen went on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay froze solid . Winter of 1857 that was . Ai n't hardly anybody remembers winters like that now . " Alice knelt by the stove , watching to make sure the fire caught . " The bay froze the year my father died . " " What 's that ? " " The winter my father died . The bay froze that year . " Owen moved his pipe from one side of his mouth to the other . " We do n't get the snow like we used to anymore . I know that much . " Life had gotten soft , he said , what with having electricity since they laid the cables from the mainland after the hurricane , and deliveries of milk and meat , and even vegetables out of season . They did n't used to have things like that on the island . Any milk they had came from their own cows and meat from their own chickens , and that was n't often . You did n't just have a chicken every Sunday when he was growing up . He shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to work then , " he said . Owen patted Alice on the shoulder and slowly crossed to the door . " Much obliged , " he said . She listened as he walked across the porch and settled on the bench . After a moment , the heavy scent of his pipe smoke came wafting through the screen . Alice 's mother and her brother , Will , arrived minutes later . " Hot in here , " Evelyn Daggett said as she took off her straw hat and set it on the counter . " I thought you 'd want breakfast , " Alice said . " Will , what do you have in that basket ? " Evelyn asked . Will peered beneath the bit of cloth that covered the basket hanging from his arm . " Three eggs . " " Three eggs . That 's your breakfast . Those two hens still are n't laying . " " There 's some bread left , " Alice said . Alice went to the back room and returned with a frying pan . She spooned a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eggs into the pan . " Fried ? " Will whined . " I hate fried . " " There 's not enough eggs for scrambled , " Evelyn said . The eggs sizzled in the pan , gradually crisping around the edges . Alice took three plates from the shelf under the counter , slid a cooked egg onto each one , and added a slice of bread . Before sitting down to eat with the others , she cut a couple of pieces from the white of her egg and set them in a bowl for Molly , who dove off the counter and followed Alice to her shelf in the back . " Why 's that foghorn still howling ? " Evelyn said . " I do n't know . " Alice pulled a stool up to the counter and reached for a fork . " That Ethan Cunningham , staying up half the night and then not even bothering to shut off the horn . He 's a poor excuse for a lighthouse keeper . His poor mother . I know she 's got no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethan worries her sick , up there with his paintings all night long . He needs to get married . " Alice shot her mother an amused glance . " You think getting married will solve everyone 's problems . " " It 's a place to start . Will , stop playing with your food . " " I want cereal . " " You ca n't have cereal . " " Why not ? " Will eyed the boxes of cereal on a shelf down the first aisle . " Because we ca n't afford to eat any more of the stock . We do n't hardly have enough money to order anything for the summer people . " " But that cereal 's been here all winter . " " The boxes ai n't been opened . There 's nothing wrong with them . " " Except the ones the mice been nibbling on . " " Will Daggett , when was the last time you saw a mouse in here ? " " Yesterday . " Evelyn rolled her eyes at Alice . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm done . " " No , you 're not . Finish that egg . " Evelyn pointed to the yolk in the middle of his plate . Will took his fork and smeared the yolk around . " Will , " Evelyn said in a warning tone . " Eat it , do n't play with it . " She pushed her plate away and lit a cigarette . " I still say one of those Cunningham girls should have come home to live with their mother . I do n't know if that Ethan is even fit to be taking care of her . The way he neglects the lighthouse , you can only guess what he does with her . You know she ca n't get in and out of bed by herself . " " I know , " Alice said , only half-listening . The story of Mrs. Cunningham 's troubles was one her mother particularly relished since Mr. Cunningham had dropped dead of a heart attack back in January . Mrs. Cunningham , who had suffered from polio years earlier , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ethan had come back from the mainland to take his father 's place as the lighthouse keeper and to care for his mother . After the 1938 hurricane the Coast Guard replaced the kerosene lamp with an electric one that simply needed to be turned on at night and off in the morning . The old keepers had slept fitfully or not at all , watching the kerosene flame to make sure it stayed lit . Now Ethan rolled out of bed whenever he pleased and flicked a switch . Sometimes he left the lighthouse lit and the foghorn braying until eight or nine o'clock in the morning , long after the fishermen had headed out . It was nothing short of a scandal on Snow . " I bet he leaves her lying there for hours , just waiting for him to come get her up and fix breakfast , " Evelyn went on smugly . " Not that Mrs. Cunningham would ever let on . She 's too good for that . Never wants to say anything bad about anybody , especially that genius son of hers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roses in that house these days . She came from money , just like Phoebe Shattuck . Spent it all on Ethan 's education and look where it got her . Poor woman . Phil Cunningham was only fifty-eight , you know . " " I know , " Alice repeated . " You got anything to give Mr. Pierce ? " " Bread and butter . " " You better call him in . " " I already gave him some tobacco . " " Well , we ca n't let him starve . " Alice collected the dishes and took them to the sink in the back room . Then she went to the door . Owen sat gazing off at the water and puffing on his pipe . " Would you like some breakfast ? " Alice called . He turned his head slowly , as though he had never dreamed of receiving such an invitation . " That would be fine . A little something before I head out for the day . That is , if you can spare it . " Alice held the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Five boxes of safety matches , two balls of string , three boxes of clothespins . Alice marked them down on a pad of paper and went on to the next shelf , taking inventory . They needed more stock than she had figured to get the store ready for the arrival of the summer people . She would have to convince some of the suppliers to give her credit . It was like this every year . By spring , there was almost no money left in the strongbox up at the house . In the first years when they owned the store , Evelyn had ignored Alice when she went through the books and made changes in the order forms . Then one day she threw the ledger book across the counter and said , " Alright , you do it . You run the store . " If anyone had asked , Alice might have pointed out that her mother was not an ideal candidate to be the storekeeper . A delegation of islanders arrived at the house a week after her father 's death , led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warden . They had it all figured out . Walter Johnson wanted to sell the store . Evelyn could use the money from the sale of her husband 's boat as a down payment , and Walter would throw in the old Model T truck and the store 's stock . Evelyn agreed in a whisper . She did not have the strength to refuse , and where was she going to go , what was she going to do , with two children to feed ? Alice was eleven when her father died , but she understood the situation only too well . Either they made a success with the store , or they starved . Her mother sat behind the counter in a stupor , gazing at the islanders who came through the door as though she had never met them and could n't imagine what they wanted with her now . She left the mail sitting in the sack for hours without sorting it , unwilling to believe this was her job , too . Alice took to running as fast as she could from the schoolhouse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it in the wooden boxes lining the wall behind the counter before the islanders came looking for their letters . The hours at the schoolhouse dragged by while she stared out the window , wondering if her mother was giving the fishermen too much in exchange for their bartered catches or extending credit when she should n't . She could not get over to the store fast enough . Alice was sixteen now , and she had been managing the store 's accounts since she was twelve . The islanders came to her with special requests or to settle their bills . When she went down the aisle , counting the cans of baked beans , she felt she had a personal stake in every last item in the store . Through the screen , she could hear her mother out on the porch , talking to Owen Pierce . Their voices rose and fell aimlessly . She had almost finished with the inventory when the door swung open , and Nate Shattuck crossed the floor , whistling . " Hey sweetheart , " he called . " Think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list he handed her , which had been written out by his wife , Phoebe . She knew that Phoebe was ashamed to come down to the store herself because they had paid nothing on their bill for so long . Alice had sworn earlier that week that she was cutting off their credit . Now , glancing at the meager list , she could n't bring herself to do it . Nate Shattuck might be shiftless , as everyone said , but he had three children to feed . Alice measured out five pounds of flour and took a bottle of milk from the cooler . She brought a bag of rice and a jar of molasses from the shelf . Nate watched her , whistling all the while . " Nice day , huh ? " he said . " I thought that rain would never end . " Alice nodded and set the groceries in a box on the counter . " Guess you 're looking forward to the summer people coming . Me , too . I 've got a lot of work lined up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the summer people left their cars for the winter . " Ai n't none of those cars going to start . " Nate grinned as he slid the box from the counter . He could already hear all those engines turning over , dead . " You 're a doll , " he said . " Thanks , Alice . " Alice watched him go with a sense of misgiving . Like everyone else on the island , she could n't say no to Nate Shattuck . The store filled up with people after that , in the fifteen minutes before the ferry was due to arrive . Miss Weeden , the schoolteacher , came in for her throat drops , and Rose Brovelli , Ernie 's wife , bought penny candy for her grandsons . When the ferry 's horn sounded , Alice followed all the customers out the door . Tony Mendoza , the captain , was just nosing the ferry alongside the dock . Evelyn had joined the islanders gathered at the foot of the dock . Ernie Brovelli was talking with Nate Shattuck . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the porch , where Owen Pierce stood leaning against the railing . " George Tibbits , " he said , gazing at the deck of the boat . For the people of Snow Island , spring did not begin when the last chunks of ice disappeared from the shore or the first summer people arrived to open their houses . The start of the season was marked by the morning George Tibbits stepped from the ferry , blinking at the light . He came to Snow each year on a warm day when you could smell the water after the locked-in months of winter , when the air was thick with the clotted scent of mud and salt and dried seaweed . This year George Tibbits was late . It was well into May , past the days that ordinarily mark the start of spring . Owen Pierce and Ernie Brovelli had been speculating for weeks now about when Tibbits would show up , though they were not especially surprised he had not appeared . The winter of 1941 had been a hard one . The temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January , and patches of snow clung to the rocks in the woods until April . Owen was right . The stooped figure standing at the railing in a brown suit was George Tibbits . Alice should have known this was the day George Tibbits would come , but she had not thought of it once . Captain Tony set the gangplank in place . George Tibbits reached for the small leather suitcase at his feet , gave a quick nod of his head to no one in particular , and made his way down the plank . The people assembled by the dock parted to let him through . He did not look to the right or left . With his head bowed , he took the path past the store and up the hill to the road . " I knew he 'd come today . That man 's a walking barometer , " Owen said , watching with everyone else as George reached the road , shifted his suitcase from one hand to the other , and started for the far side of the island .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
