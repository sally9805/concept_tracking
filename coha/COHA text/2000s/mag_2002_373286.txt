Bruce Springsteen has a songbook that reads like a union membership log . He has written about cops , fire fighters , soldiers , road builders , steelworkers , factory laborers and migrant workers . Springsteen himself has held exactly one real job . For a few weeks in 1968 when he was 18 , he worked as a gardener . But his gift is not horticulture . His great gift  --  the one that makes him the best rock ' n ' roll singer of his era  --  is empathy . Springsteen does n't know what a 40-hour workweek feels like , but he knows how a 40-hour workweek makes you feel . " If you roll out of bed in the morning , " he says , " even if you 're the deepest pessimist or cynic , you just took a step into the next day . When I was growing up , we did n't have very much , but I saw by my mom 's example that a step into the next day was very important . Hey , some good things might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could happen . " <P> On The Rising , his first album of new material in seven years , Springsteen is again writing about work , hope and American life as it is lived this very moment . The Rising is about Sept. 11 , and it is the first significant piece of pop art to respond to the events of that day . Many of the songs are written from the perspectives of working people whose lives and fates intersected with those hijacked planes . The songs are sad , but the sadness is almost always matched with optimism , promises of redemption and calls to spiritual arms . There is more rising on The Rising than in a month of church . <P> The Rising also marks the return of the E Street Band . The band  --  seven hardworking Joes in their 50s and 60s , plus Springsteen 's wife , backup singer and Jersey girl Patti Scialfa  --  has always been a proxy for the Springsteen audience . The E Streeters do n't eat meat sandwiches out of metal lunch boxes , but it 's easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springsteen 's recorded music opened a gulf between the Boss and his core fans , one that The Rising seems intent on closing . <P> When Springsteen cut the band loose in 1987 , Bruce was a major American somebody who had made his name singing about nobodies . But money shines a lot brighter than empathy , and after Born in the U.S.A. , Springsteen was n't just rich ; he was loaded , and everyone in America knew it . Rather than continue as the wealthy rock-poet of the American grunt and risk being labeled inauthentic , Springsteen set out for new territory . As he put it in Better Days , a 1992 song , " It 's a sad funny ending to find yourself pretending/A rich man in a poor man 's shirt . "
