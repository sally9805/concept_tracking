MEAT WAS BOUGHT AT A high price by the Middle Pleistocene hominids of the Iberian Peninsula . Large prey meant more meat , yet large prey was very dangerous . The pressure to hunt was unrelenting , for the hominids were almost entirely carnivorous , but the people lived well because their technology was the most advanced in the world . <p> It is unusual for a linguist to be called for in a murder investigation , especially an undergraduate linguist . Had my Uncle Arturo not been in charge , and had I not been staying at his house at the time , I would not have become involved at all . He told me little as he escorted me into the Puerto Real clinic and took me to a meeting room . <p> On a monitor screen was a girl in a walled garden . Crouching in a corner , she had a fearful , hunted look about her . I could see that she wore a blanket , that her skin was olive-brown , and that her features were bold and heavy , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice the most remarkable thing about her : she had no forehead ! " Who - I mean what is she ? " I exclaimed . <p> " That 's what a lot of people want to know , " replied my uncle . " I think she is a feral girl with a deformed head . She was found this morning , on a farm a few kilometers north of here . " <p> " Has she said anything ? " I asked , then added , " Can she talk ? " <p> " Carlos , why do you think I called you ? This is a clinic where the staff are quite good at dealing with tourists who do n't speak Spanish , but this girl 's language stopped them cold . " <p> " So she does speak ? " <p> " She seems to use words , that is why you are here . Before you ask , she is locked in the walled garden at the center of the clinic because she ca n't stand being indoors . We need to communicate with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government is involved . DNA tests are being done . " <p> I was about to commence my third year at university , studying linguistics . Being continually short of money , I would drive my wreck of a motor scooter down to Cadiz every summer , stay with my uncle , rent a board and go windsurfing . By now I owed Uncle Arturo for three such holidays , and this was the first favor he had asked in return . My mind worked quickly : love child of government minister , hit on the head , abandoned in the mountains , DNA tests being done to establish the parents ' identities . <p> " There are better linguists than I , " I said . <p> " But I know I can trust you . For now we need total discretion . " <p> I shrugged . " Okay , what do I do ? " <p> " She must be hungry . When a blackbird landed in the garden she caught it and ate it . Raw . " <p> I swallowed . She sounded dangerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roast a joint of meat , " my uncle suggested . <p> " Me ? " I exclaimed . " Cook a roast ? I 've never even boiled an egg . " <p> " Well then , time to learn . " He laughed , without much mirth . <p> It turned out that I had three advantages over the clinic 's staff and my uncle 's police : long hair , a beard , and a calf-length coat . It made me look somehow reassuring to the girl , but days passed before I realized why . <p> I entered the garden with a bundle of wood and a leg of lamb . The girl 's eyes followed me warily . I stopped five meters from her and sat down . I put a hand on my chest and said , " Carlos . " She did not reply . I shrugged , then began to pile twigs together in front of me . The girl watched . I reached into a pocket , took out a cigarette lighter , and flicked it alight . The girl gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably looked as if the flame was coming out of my fist . Calmly , I lit the twigs , slipped the lighter back into my pocket , and piled larger sticks onto the fire . <p> My original plan had been to roast the meat , then gain the girl 's trust by offering her some . I placed the leg in the flames - but almost immediately she scampered forward and snatched it out . <p> " Butt ! " she snapped , leaving no doubt that the word meant something like fool . <p> I shrugged and sat back , then touched my chest again and said , " Carlos . " <p> This time she returned the gesture and said , " Els . " <p> Els stoked the fire until a bed of coals was established . Only now did she put the joint between two stones , just above the coals . Fat began to trickle down and feed the flames . We shared a meal of roast lamb around sunset and I collected about two dozen words on the dictaphone in my pocket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to look uneasy again . I had made a fire , I had provided meat , and it was fairly obvious what she expected next . <p> I stood up , said , " Carlos , " then gestured to the gate and walked away . The perplexity on Els 's face was almost comical as I watched the video replay a few minutes later . <p> " What have you learned so far ? " asked my uncle as the debriefing began . Two other people were present ; they had been introduced as Dr. Tormes and Marella . The woman was in her thirties and quite pretty , while Tormes was about ten years older . <p> " Firstly , Els trusts me a little , " I pointed out . <p> " I thought she was supposed to accept you as another prisoner , " said my uncle . <p> " She does n't understand the idea of being a prisoner , " I replied . " She calls me Carr . Loss is her word for fire . For her Carlos seems to be Carr who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire after introducing yourself as a firemaker , " said Tormes . <p> " Yes . All her words are single syllable , and she has not spoken a sentence more than five words long . Intonation and context seem important in her language , though . " <p> " You say language , " said Uncle Arturo . " Is it a genuine language ? " <p> " It depends what you mean by genuine . Any linguist could invent a primitive language , but Els has a fluency that would only come with years of use . Do we know anything about her ? " <p> My uncle glanced to Tormes and Marella . <p> " Els is just a feral girl with a severely deformed skull , " said Tormes . " Perhaps she was abandoned in the mountains while very young , and animals reared her . " <p> " Animals could never have taught her such a language , " I replied . " Animals do n't have fire , either . " <p> They glanced uncomfortably at each other , but volunteered no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , then at dawn the three orderlies were sent in to seize her . Moments later I entered the garden , loaded with more firewood and meat , and armed with a sharpened curtain rod . I made a show of driving off the orderlies after an extended bout of shouting , and fortunately Els did not seem to have any concept of acting . I was treated like a genuine hero as we settled down to another day together . While we talked Els began to make stone knives and scrapers out of the garden 's ornamental rocks . She even charred the end of my curtain rod in the fire and scraped it into a lethal-looking , fire-hardened point . Again I left her at sunset and went through a long debriefing with my uncle , Marella , and Tormes . <p> " If Els was raised by wild sheep or rabbits , how did she learn to make stone tools and fire-hardened spear points ? " I asked with undisguised sarcasm . <p> " We are as puzzled as you , " replied Tormes calmly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newly slaughtered sheep . Els skinned and butchered it with great skill , using her newly made stone knives and scrapers . It was only now that Els actually approached me . Coming around to my side of the fire , she rubbed mutton fat through my hair , then pinned it back with blackbird feathers . By now I had learned to say " Di , " which seemed to cover both thanks and sorry . Over the next half hour , she made me understand that although I was skinny , she thought I was very brave to go hunting at night . <p> AT THE DEBRIEFING on the fifth day I had an audience of a dozen people , two of whom I recognized from the Department of Anthropology in the university in Madrid . It took only a minute to walk the tens of thousands of years from the garden to the committee room . <p> " I now have over a hundred words , " I reported . " I can communicate with Els fairly well , and she has answered a few questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhuun , and they have always lived here . " <p> " What ? " exclaimed Tormes . " Impossible . " <p> " I 'm only telling you what Els said . They have a detailed calendar , and a counting system based on the number twenty . " <p> " Ten fingers and ten toes , " said Marella . <p> " Did she do your hair ? " asked one of the new observers . <p> " Yes . Grooming seems to be a bonding ritual for the Rhuun , and possibly a precursor to sexual activity as well , " I explained . <p> " So she made a pass at you , " laughed my uncle . Nobody else laughed . <p> " She has been removed from her tribe for the first time in her life , " I added . <p> " Then you are her new provider , " said Tormes . " She may be feeling insecure because you are not mating with her . " <p> This time a few snickers rippled around the table . <p> " Look , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my uncle , scowling . <p> " Besides , she might be disappointed , " he replied , and this time everyone really did laugh . <p> " From now on you will return to her after a couple of hours each night , and pretend you were lucky with your hunting , " Tormes hurriedly advised , seeing the expression on my face . " Just having you nearby at night should gain her trust . " <p> " But seriously , stay on your own side of the fire , " advised my uncle . " Technically she 's a ward of the state , and probably a minor . " <p> When the meeting broke up Marella and Tormes invited me to join them for a coffee before I returned to Els . Wearing my long coat over jeans and a T-shirt , but with my hair still greased and pinned back with feathers , I felt quite out of place . The cafe was across the road from the clinic , and was about as sterile . Most people think of Cadiz as a pretty little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Puerto Real , the messy industrial fringe of the holiday city that visitors barely notice as they drive through . Whatever the setting , it was my first filtered coffee for many days and I was very grateful for it . I also ordered a large salad . A man named Garces joined us , but he said little at first . <p> " There 's more to Els than you think , " said Tormes after I ordered another cup . <p> " You underestimate me , " I replied . <p> " What do you think ? " <p> " Had they not been extinct for thirty thousand years , I 'd say she was Neanderthal . Even her stone tools look very like what I 've seen in museums . " <p> " Not Neanderthal , " said Marella . <p> " Sorry ? " <p> " Els 's tools are relatively primitive , more like those of the Neanderthals ' ancestor species , Homo heidelbergensis , " Tormes explained . <p> " I do n't know much about paleoanthropology , " I said , although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Spain over the past two million years . <p> " The heidelbergensians were around for six hundred thousand years , " said Tormes , as if he were speaking for a television documentary . " They were the first hominids to use advanced technology like clothing , artificial shelters , and probably language . There is a cave in the north called the Pit of Bones where they even ritually disposed of their dead . They lived in an ice-age environment that would have killed any hominid that did not use clothing . They were once the brightest people ever , and they had the most advanced technology on Earth for longer than Homo sapiens has existed . Their cranial capacity actually overlapped with the modern human average , but they were also phenomenally strong . " <p> I had by now noticed that Els could break branches that were way beyond my strength . Perhaps there was more to this than a hoax . <p> " You talk as if Els is a real cave girl , " I said casually . <p> " She is , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my second coffee . I took a few sips while the waiter cleaned up and removed some cups and dishes . My mind was screaming that Garces was mad , yet he lacked the manic enthusiasm of genuine nut cases . He almost looked unhappy . The waiter left , skillfully balancing a pile of plates and cups on one arm . <p> " The girl 's DNA is not human , " Garces continued . " True , it has more in common with human DNA than that of an ape , but there are not enough base pairs in common with human DNA for her to interbreed with , say , yourself . " <p> " Take that back ! " I snapped , already near my limit with this onslaught of weirdness . <p> " Sorry , sorry , " he said at once . " I have been rather unsettled by all this , and .... " He scratched his head . " Look , what I have found is impossible , but I have done my tests in good faith . The base pair comparisons that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Neanderthals than Homo sapiens , but examination of DNA mutation sites and rates suggests that she could be from the Neanderthals ' ancestral species . " <p> " There was also semen found on a vaginal swab , " said Tormes . <p> " Indeed ! " said Garces . " Its DNA was of the same species . Els 's husband , lover , or whatever is another heidelbergensian . He is also a blood relative , from perhaps three generations back , but this is not unknown in small and isolated tribes . " <p> There was silence as I sipped my coffee . Almost before I knew it , my cup was empty . Apparently , I was expected to say something . <p> " Genetic engineering was around in the early 1990s , when Els would have been born , " I suggested , seriously out of my depth and well aware of it . <p> " Balls , " replied Garces wearily , as if he had heard the suggestion too many times over the past few days . " That 's like saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had primitive rockets . Even today we ca n't engineer genetic changes on the scale found in the subject 's DNA . " <p> " Her name is Els , " I insisted . <p> " Yes , yes , Els . Whatever her name , she - " <p> " She 's the victim of some cruel genetic hoax ! " I began angrily . <p> " Have n't you been listening ? " Garces demanded , banging his fists on the table . <p> " Yes , and to get back to your analogy , the Nazis flew at least two types of manned rocket , and they drew up designs for manned spacecraft as well . I saw a documentary on television , the Nazis put rockets into space big enough to carry a man - " <p> " All right , all right , Nazis in space is a bad analogy , " he conceded , waving his hands . " The point is that we have never had the skills to make the massive changes to human DNA that I have observed in , er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits and pieces of the genome and clone the occasional sheep in the 1990s , but not create a new race - or should I say re-create an old one . " <p> " But Els is a fact , " I insisted . " Genetics only proves - " <p> " This is n't just genetics ! " said Garces sharply . " Els has stepped straight out of the Middle Pleistocene ! She has practically no radioactive contaminants in her tissues from nuclear bomb tests or the Chernobyl fallout . Her levels of industrial contaminants like dioxin also suggest that she had been eating food grown in this century for only two weeks . " <p> " I do n't understand , " I admitted . <p> " Els and her tribe are genuine , " said Marella . " That girl in the clinic across the road is an ice age hominid , she is from the ice age . " <p> That was a conversation stopper if ever there was one . For a time we sat staring at each other , saying nothing . The waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you willing to put that in a press release ? " I asked once we were alone again . <p> " Young man , if I had been unfaithful to my husband I would not want it in a press release , whether it was true or not , " interjected Marella , almost in a snarl . " Not unless it was a matter of life and death , anyway . Before we all go making fools of ourselves with public statements , we need to know Els 's side of the story . " <p> Tormes looked particularly uncomfortable , and Garces squirmed . Marella glared at me until I stared down at the table . She was clearly used to taking no nonsense from any man , whether plumber or prime minister . <p> " All their pelt cloaks are new sheepskin , and their scrapers are new , " said Tormes . " Their spears have been cut from modern hawthorne stands . " <p> " You mean you have evidence of a whole tribe ? " I exclaimed . <p> Yet again there was silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment . <p> " I think we have said enough , " suggested Marella coldly . " Carlos , what do you have to say about Els - as a linguist ? " <p> I was annoyed but cautious . The body language displayed by Tormes and Garces suggested that they were treating Marella very carefully . Her face was familiar , in a way that a face glimpsed countless times on television might be . <p> " Five days is not enough for a truly informed assessment , " I explained first . " Els 's language is primitive , yet highly functional . It 's adequate to coordinate a hunting party , pass on tool-making skills , and so on . She actually has a word for ice , even though there is no naturally occurring ice in the area - " <p> " That 's significant , " exclaimed Marella . " She may remember an ice age . Did she talk about bright lights in the sky , or flying things ? Strange men with godlike powers ? " <p> " No . She has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have words to describe what she 's seen here in Puerto Real over the past five days . " <p> " We must teach her Spanish , " said Marella . <p> " No ! " cried Tormes firmly . " She is our only window on Middle Pleistocene culture . She must not be contaminated . She will be kept with you , Carlos , well away from the rest of us . " <p> " My marriage and reputation are at stake ! " exclaimed Marella . " Marella , Els is bigger than - " <p> " And your position at the university is certainly at stake , " Marella warned . <p> " What else do you have to tell us , Carlos ? " asked Garces hurriedly . <p> " Well , nearly a third of Rhuun words are devoted to arithmetic , their calendar , the seasons and the passage of time . Els can understand and name numbers up to a hundred thousand , and she even understands the concept of zero . " <p> " So ? " asked Marella impatiently . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been around for a few centuries , " I explained . <p> " On this world , anyway , " said Marella . " The rest of you may be too frightened to talk about aliens , but I am not . " <p> WITHIN MINUTES I was back in the Middle Pleistocene , dumping another dead sheep beside the fire . I had been bringing in the firewood wrapped in blankets belonging to the clinic , and I now found Els had made a simple , tent-like shelter from them . The heidelbergensians had invented artificial shelters , Tormes had said . I fed a few branches into the fire , then lay down beside it , wrapped in a spare blanket . Looking up at the stars , I recalled that I had not slept in the open since a school camp five years ago . Although I windsurfed and rode a scooter , I am not the outdoors type and I prefer to sleep under a roof . <p> I gave a start as a hand touched my shoulder . Els ! She moved as silently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Crrun . " The word meant something like fellow hunter , tribesman , and family member all in one , but this time her intonation was softer , almost a purr . Perhaps the Rhuun also stretched it to cover sweetheart and lover . <p> Aware that a video camera was recording everything , I gestured to the space between me and the fire . Els lay down , staring anxiously at me . Perhaps she was terrified that I had not mated with her because I was planning to abandon her . Only a few meters away a dozen anthropologists were gathered around a video screen , and were probably laughing . Els began to draw up the hem of her cloak . I seized her hand hurriedly . <p> " Els , Carr , crrun , " I assured her , then added that I was tired from a difficult hunt . <p> The words transformed her . Frightening and dangerous this place might be , yet a male had now declared crrun with her , whatever that really meant . I was also a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the stars for a while and reciting something too fast for me to follow , she eventually pulled my arm over her , pressed my hand against her breast and went to sleep . <p> The next morning Els began to make me a cloak out of the sheepskins that had accumulated . This was apparently the only form of Rhuun dress , but it was immensely practical and versatile . In an ice age winter it would have also provided the wearer with a sort of mobile home as well as a sleeping bag . Instead of sewing the skins together , she pinned them with barbed and sharpened hawthorne twigs . I made a big show of being pleased with it . <p> Because Rhuun words were short , simple nouns and verbs , strung together with rudimentary grammar , we were able to communicate adequately after only days . Intonation was important too , but that was far harder to learn . My theory was that Rhuun words , which were generally gutteral , had developed to blend in with the snorts , grunts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stalked wild sheep under the cover of their pelt cloaks , smelling like sheep themselves and calling to each other with bleat-like words . <p> On the other hand , the mathematics of the Rhuun calendar was quite advanced for a nomadic , stone-age tribe . The Rhuun might have developed their own simple language , then come in contact with members of a very advanced society and copied ideas like counting and calendars . Els had no grasp of nations , laws , or even machines . To her all machines were animals . She knew nothing of tame animals , either . She treated all animals as either prey or predators . <p> That evening Marella was not at the debriefing meeting . Most of the discussion revolved around the way Els fastened the sheepskins of my cloak together , and how this might have been the birth of clothing . Tormes approached me later , as I sat alone in the clinic 's cafeteria . <p> " Eating another salad ? " he asked . <p> " Els is more of a carnivore than we humans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by on meat alone . " <p> " She seems to be taking a shine to you . " <p> " I like her too . She has a strangely powerful charisma . " <p> " And pleasantly firm boobs ? " <p> " That too . I appear to be her mate , even without consummation . Her , er , other mate abandoned her when she was still alive . In her tribe that appears to be grounds for divorce . " <p> " The affection does not seem to be entirely one-sided . You kissed her last night . " <p> " Ah , er , well , that was an experiment . " <p> " And a highly successful experiment - which leads into another matter . Would you consider staying with her , say for a trip to Madrid ? " <p> " Madrid ? " <p> " For her unveiling , so to speak . As her companion . " <p> Images of myself on television in a sheepskin cloak flashed through my mind . It was not an appealing prospect , but I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready , " I began . <p> " But you can prepare her , she really trusts you . You would gain a lot of favor with some very powerful people . Some would even like you to screw her , to research Middle Pleistocene sexual practices . " <p> I closed my eyes and took a deep breath . <p> " Look , this is grotesque ! " I snapped . " Just who are you ? Do you think you can - " <p> " I am a professor of anthropology , Carlos , and I recognize what Els represents . A genuine archaic hominid , straight out of the Pleistocene . " <p> I shook my head . <p> " Apart from Els herself we have no other evidence . " <p> " We do have other evidence , Carlos ; we just do n't understand it . Last year I made a strange find , in what had once been the bed of a shallow lake . It was a collection of stone scrapers , knives , and hand-axes . " <p> " So ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's as if a tribe of heidelbergensians just dropped everything they were carrying and vanished . " <p> " They probably dropped everything and ran when something frightened them , " I said . " A bear , maybe . " <p> " Possibly , but that 's not the point . The site I found was seven thousand years old , four times more recent than the last Neanderthal and a quarter of a million years later than Homo heidelbergensis was around . " <p> Reality began to waver before my eyes . I was sitting at a table in a clinic , wearing a Middle Pleistocene hairstyle , eating a salad , and practically engaged to a heidelbergensian girl . <p> " There are some odd folk tales told in this area , " Tormes continued . " Huge monkeys with spears , enormously strong wild men who kill cattle , that sort of thing . " <p> " Are you serious ? " I exclaimed . " A lost tribe of cave men in southern Spain ? This is not even a wilderness area . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite a lot of sheep and cattle . " <p> " I said we have evidence , not an explanation . " <p> I munched the last of my salad . <p> " I must get back to Els , " I said as I stood up . <p> " Morella and I are - were - having an affair , " Tormes suddenly but unashamedly confessed . " We were on a field trip , looking for excavation sites . When we found Els ... well , our cover was compromised . Morella 's husband is a minister in the government , and the government can not afford scandals in the current political climate . " <p> So there was no love child , but there was a sex scandal . <p> " Where do I fit in ? " I asked . <p> " Els is to be made public . Very public . " <p> " She will be terrified . " <p> " You can make it easier for her by remaining her translator and companion . There will be a lot of money and fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do one questionable thing . " <p> " And that is ? " <p> " Pretend to be Marella . " <p> I agreed . The story was very simple , and the most important part was already on videotape . I had supposedly contacted Tormes about doing voluntary field work at a site called the Field of Devils , just north of Cadiz . We had met six days earlier at the farm of a man named Ramoz , and I had been videoing for two hours when Els first appeared . <p> " We are about to watch the most important part of the video that Marella shot , " said Tormes as we sat with Marella and Uncle Arturo in the darkened committee room . " A version has been made without the sound track . We shall say that you were inexperienced with the camera and disconnected the microphone . " <p> " Why ? " I asked . " Because my voice can be heard , " said Marella icily . <p> The screen lit up , showing scrubby pasture and hills . It was fertile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long grass . Suddenly Marella zoomed in on a group of people dressed in cloaks and carrying spears . They were stalking the bull . The scene might have been straight out of the Pleistocene had the bull not been wearing a yellow plastic ear tag . <p> The hunters worked as a team , three men and a girl . We watched as they stripped off their cloaks , then approached the bull naked . Their hair was drawn back and pinned with feathers . The men positioned themselves in long grass and crouched down . The girl collected some stones , then cautiously approached the bull . She flung a stone , which went wide . The bull ignored her . She hit it with her next stone . It looked up , then returned to cropping the grass . The next stone struck the bull just above the eye . It charged . The girl dropped her other stones and ran for the ambush site . The bull slowed , snorted , then returned to its grazing . <p> " They 're reenacting a stone-age hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother recording it ? " replied Professor Tormes , disgust plain in his voice . " They 're doing so much wrong , I do n't know whether to laugh or cry . " <p> " But it 's a lot of fun , " Marella said as she panned back to take in the overall scene . " They must be actors , practicing for a documentary . " <p> " Maybe . Their consistency people ca n't be there , or they 'd be screaming about the bull 's plastic eartag . " <p> " There are no camera crews yet . They must be practicing . " <p> " Well as a re-creation of Neanderthal hunting it has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese . I mean look at the girl trying to goad the bull into chasing her by throwing stones . It 's all wrong . " <p> " Why ? ? " <p> " Neanderthals did n't have projectile weapons . " <p> " But even monkeys throw stones . " <p> " Bah , that 's just behavior learned from watching us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the bull to the hidden hunters , not let themselves be chased . As for the spears ! Neanderthal spears had stone tips . Those are just pikes with fire-hardened points . " I turned to glance across at Tormes . He was squirming in his seat . <p> " I presume that they cleared this with the man who owns this land - and the bull , " said his voice from the speakers . <p> " Well , yes . Ramoz is a bit excitable , " Marella agreed . " We should go down and warn them . " <p> " Not with that bull running loose and no fences to stop it . " <p> The bull looked up warily as the girl approached again , armed with another a handful of rocks . She shouted and waved . The bull stared at her . She flung a rock , hitting it squarely on the nose . The bull bawled angrily and charged , and this time it did not break off the chase as the girl fled . Although she was fast and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as she ran for the ambush site . <p> " Well now what ? " Tormes 's voice asked . " They ca n't kill the bull  --  " Even as he spoke , the three naked men erupted out of the grass and drove their spears into the flanks of the bull as it charged past them . Far from defeated by the initial attack , the animal turned on the hunters . Now two boys who had been hiding nearby ran up with fresh spears , and the leader worried at the bull 's face with his spear while the other two men attacked its flanks and hind legs . After suffering perhaps a dozen spear wounds the bull 's hind legs gave way , and then the end came quickly . <p> " I do n't believe this ! " Tormes exclaimed . " That bull is part of a prize breeding herd . " <p> " Was , " said Marella . <p> We could now hear the tones of a cell phone as Tormes punched in the number for the police operations center . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he reported to Marella that there were no reenactment groups or documentary crews in the area . On the screen , a hunter jumped onto the bull 's carcass and waved a spear high in triumph . <p> " The police said there 's a military helicopter in the area , and they 're diverting it to these GPS coordinates . That group is definitely illegal . " <p> " So Ramoz does not know that one of his stud bulls is the star of a documentary on Neanderthal hunting ? " Marella asked . <p> " Apparently not . The police said to stay out of sight until they arrive . " <p> " I 'd better stay out of sight even after they arrive , " said Marella . <p> " Yes , your husband might not react sympathetically . " <p> " Pity . My tape could make the television news : the last Neanderthals , arrested for poaching and taken away in a helicopter . " <p> " Your tape must vanish without trace , preferably into a fire . " <p> With the bull dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kill . I could even see two babies being carried . The hunters put their cloaks back on and sat down to rest . Using what appeared to be stone knives and scrapers the group began to butcher the carcass . They were efficient and skilled , and it might have even made a convincing picture had it not been for a woman with the cigar and the bull 's bright yellow eartag . The children started gathering wood , and presently the smoker used her cigar to start a fire . They began to roast cuts of the bull . <p> " I later found the cigar . It turned out to be a roll of leaves and grass used for starting fires , " Tormes explained to me . <p> " Els has told me she is a ' hunt boy , ' even though she 's a girl , " I explained . " Apparently boys began their apprenticeships as hunters by being decoys who lure dangerous game back to the tribe 's ambush . " <p> " That makes sense , " said Tormes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only teenagers were girls . " <p> " Like in all societies , women could become honorary males in times of sufficient need , " added Marella . <p> From the speakers I could now hear the sound of an engine . The tribe suddenly grew fearful and huddled together . The engine stopped . <p> " The police ? " asked Marella 's voice . " Already ? " <p> " No , they were sending a military helicopter , " explained Tormes . <p> " Wait a minute ! Someone might have called Ramoz to double-check if he knows about those fools . " <p> There was a distant gunshot . The camera swept giddily up to the top of a ridge , where a figure was waving a gun and shouting . <p> " Ramoz , " said Tormes . <p> The farmer worked the pump action of his shotgun , then fired into the air again . The camera swept back down to the carcass , but there was now nobody visible . Marella tracked Ramoz as he came running down , his shotgun held high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved his hands at the carcass , then at the fire , then at the sky . Finally he fell to his knees , clutching at his hair . <p> " He looks upset , " commented Marella . <p> " I hope those idiots stay hidden , " said Tormes 's voice quietly . <p> " Real risk of a homicide here , " agreed Marella . " Stay low . If he spots us he might think we were involved . " <p> " If he kills someone we certainly will be involved . I can see the headlines now : MINISTER 'S WIFE AND LOVER WITNESS MURDER . Stay silent , I 'm calling the police again . " There were more cell phone tones . " Cadiz , Tormes again . We have a dangerous situation . The farmer has arrived , armed with a shotgun . Yes , he 's really distraught . No , he 's hugging the head of the dead bull . The hunters have fled , but - " <p> At the edge of the screen the decoy girl stood up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatched up his gun and shouted something incoherent . The girl presented her buttocks to him . This was too much for the farmer . He leveled the gun and fired . The girl went down . <p> " Cadiz , we have a fatality ! " Tormes cried . <p> Ramoz ran through the grass to where the girl had fallen . Suddenly spear-wielding hunters boiled out of their cover and lunged at him . The shotgun boomed one more time , then there were screams . The men stood over the fallen Ramoz , and their spears seemed to rise and fall for a very long time . The women and children arrived and gathered around the girl 's body , wailing . <p> " Cadiz , we have two down now , both presumed dead . " <p> Now there was the sound of another engine and the whirr of rotor blades , just as Ramoz 's head was lifted high on a spear point . The field of the camera suddenly gyrated crazily . <p> " Cadiz , tell the pilot to home on the plume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of Marella retching . " No , that 's just the sound of my assistant being sick . " <p> Marella had dropped the camera , and the screen just showed out-of  --  focus grass . The video was stopped , and my uncle stood up . <p> " Nothing more of interest was recorded by Marella 's camera , " he explained . " The helicopter landed , and the crew found the mutilated body of Ramoz lying beside a naked girl . Luckily for her , the shot missed , but she hit her head on a rock as she stumbled and was knocked unconscious . There was no sign of the tribesmen who killed Ramoz . " <p> " I left the field at once , and drove back to Cadiz unseen , " said Marella . " The trouble is that dozens of people have now heard replays of the phone call where you can hear me vomiting and Jose talking about his assistant . " <p> " I was taken out on the helicopter , " said Tormes . " Carlos , we can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still loose , so you fled the scene . " <p> " Two guards were left there , but they were wearing camo gear and were not easy to see , " said Marella . <p> " It is a lie , but no harm is being done , " said Uncle Arturo . <p> I nodded , but said nothing . In a year or two he would suddenly be given some very significant promotion . It was the way of the world . <p> " Everything that the Rhuun used or wore on the videotape we have just seen was simply dumped , " said Tormes . " They stripped naked and fled . " <p> " Well , at least wearing jeans and T-shirts . " My uncle laughed . <p> He started the tape again , and a scatter of stone axes , spears , scrapers , and pelt cloaks appeared on the screen , marked off by police cones and crime scene tape . The scene switched to an archeological dig , showing a very similar scatter of stone tools . <p> " This has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What has ? " I asked . <p> " I am open to suggestions , " said Tormes . <p> The video ended with footage of Els waking up in the clinic , and of three burly orderlies having a great deal of trouble restraining her . The heidelbergensian girl was at least twice as strong as a modern man . She could win an Olympic medal for weightlifting , I thought , but would she be banned for not being human enough ? The others now left , and I sat watching replays of the extraordinary video to fix the story in my mind . As my uncle had said , it was a lie without victims . I made a necklace of paperclips as I watched . Presently Marella came back . <p> " I have come for the tape , " she announced . " Seen enough ? " <p> " I have a good memory , " I replied . " It 's in the job description for a linguist . " <p> She folded her arms beneath her breasts and strutted around the table , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to say . <p> " I should have had the credit for that video , " she said . <p> " That credit comes with a very high price tag , " I replied . <p> " True , but I have lived in my husband 's shadow for too long . Being part of this discovery will bring me fame , and I will be part of it . The story will be that I came to the clinic with a headache , saw Els being restrained , and was told by staff that she was just a badly deformed girl . I noticed that she had a very strange language , so I contacted some experts at a university . " <p> " Better than nothing , " I said . <p> Suddenly Marella sat on my lap , put her hands behind my head and stared at me intently . There was neither affection nor lust in her expression , but in mine there was probably alarm . She jammed her lips against mine , then pushed her tongue between my teeth . After some moments she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back around the table again , her arms again folded . <p> " I can do anything to you , Carlos ; remember that . " <p> Els was strong . Marella was powerful . I had not taken Marella sufficiently seriously , but like Els , I had never met anyone like her . She removed the cassette from the video player . <p> " Try to cross me , try to rob me of my role in this discovery , and I shall produce this , the original tape , sound and all . Remember that . " <p> She left . Like Samson , she was both powerful and vindictive enough to destroy everyone concerned with Els , including herself . Power is a product of our civilization , but one can have it without strength . Suddenly I felt a lot closer to Els . <p> I GOT NO SLEEP that night , which was taken up with learning my role as Tormes 's supposed volunteer , and learning my lines . A press release about Els had been prepared and distributed by Marella , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just before dawn I looked through a clinic window , and was immediately caught by the beams of half a dozen spotlights . Security guards and police were already holding a line on the clinic 's lawns . Tormes came up behind me . <p> " There is to be a press conference on the lawns , " he said . " The Cadiz authorities want a share of Els before she is taken away . " <p> " Professor , the very idea of a press conference is a quarter million years in her future ! " I exclaimed . " What do they expect ? " <p> " You can translate . " <p> " No I ca n't . I can barely communicate - " <p> " Well , try ! Els is a star . Already we 're getting offers for movie contracts and marketing deals . " <p> " Marketing ? For what ? Stone axes ? Or maybe hide cloaks ? " <p> " Carlos : use your imagination : She came a quarter of a million years for Moon Mist fragrances has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I cried . " I ca n't permit this . " <p> " You have no choice . You signed a sworn statement that you were my volunteer assistant , and that you shot the video of Els 's tribe killing Ramoz and his bull . Now get her ready to be a media star . " <p> " How ? " I demanded . " She could - she will - get violent . " <p> " So ? Good television . " <p> A pinpoint of hate blazed up within me . He was powerful , but he had no strength . He could hurt Els , and I was her only defense . I could hear the distant crowd like the rumble of an approaching thunderstorm as I stepped back into the walled garden . Els called to me , ran up and kissed me , then took my hands . She pressed them firmly against her breasts . I managed a smile . This was obviously a bonding gesture , meant to remind me of the pleasures of staying with her . She still did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this message across . She was strong , yet powerless .. and I had neither strength nor power . I presented my necklace of paperclips to her , but was not surprised that she was more perplexed than delighted . She had no concept of ornamentation at all . Her hairpin feathers were functional ; they merely kept hair out of the way during the hunt . I put the necklace around her neck . She scratched her head . <p> " Har ese , " I said , lacking any words for lucky or charm . Good hunt . <p> To my surprise Els suddenly smiled broadly . <p> " Di , " she replied , then added " Carr iyk har . " <p> A couple more questions revealed that although har meant " good " and ese meant " fight or hunt , " when said together and quickly they meant " luck in hunting or fighting . " So , the Rhuun had a concept of good and bad fortune , yet there were many other things for which Els had no words . Metal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts for her . I heard the approach of the helicopter that was to whisk us away to Madrid . There was certainly no heidelbergensian word for that . The sound made Els fearful , but I held her hand . <p> " Els , Carr rak , " I explained . Els and Carr are going to flee . She immediately brightened at the prospect . " Hos , " I added . Follow and pointed to the door . <p> " Thuk ong , " she said fearfully . Death cave . To her the interior of the clinic was a dangerous cave . <p> I tried to explain that she was about to see frightening things , but that they would not hurt . <p> " Carr lan ? " she asked . <p> Lan meant both help and protect . <p> " Carr lan , " I replied , but I knew that I had a problem . <p> In the Middle Pleistocene , anything that was frightening was dangerous too . The idea of fear for a thrill did not exist . The idea of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be in mortal danger . In the distance I could hear the sounds of sirens and an increasingly large crowd . Els was like some huge cat , a dangerous predator who was stronger and more of a carnivore than I , but for all that she was curiously vulnerable . <p> She followed me into the clinic 's interior , holding my arm tightly and cowering against me . The lights had been dimmed and the corridors cleared . We walked briskly . Someone must have told the waiting crowd to be silent , but we could still hear the helicopter 's engine . Els kept warning me about cave bears . We walked out through the front doors into daylight - and the crowd roared . <p> Els panicked and tried to drag me back inside , but the doors had already been closed and locked behind us . Microphone booms , cameras , flashing lights , the helicopter , guards and police with batons , more people than Els had ever seen in her life , even a press helicopter approaching over the rooftops . Els @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop her but she was too strong . Guards broke ranks to block her path and journalists surged through the breach in the line . <p> " Carr ! Tek orr brii ! " she shouted . <p> I dodged around in front of her , pulled my hand free from Els and tried to wave the approaching mob back . There was a loud pop and Els ceased to exist . I turned to see her cloak collapsed on the grass , along with her feather hair pins scattered , an ankle beacon-circlet , and a paperclip necklace . <p> That turned out to be the beginning of a very long day . Garces , Tormes , and Uncle Arturo were near-hysterical , predictably enough . The police already had the area sealed off , but it did them no good . Els had simply been snatched into thin air . Several dozen video cameras had caught the disappearance and although the angles were different , the event remained the same . In one frame Els was there , in the next she was gone and her cloak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved , Marella alone was willingly giving interviews . Aliens had snatched Els away , she declared in triumph . Her abduction had been caught on camera . Aliens had brought her to Twenty  --  first-century Spain , then snatched her away again . To Marella 's astonishment , her theory was given no more credence than several others . A public survey favored a secret invisibility weapon being tested by the Americans , followed by a conspiracy by our own government , a divine vision , alien abduction , publicity for a new movie , and a student stunt . <p> For the rest of the week forensic teams studied the area in microscopic detail , scientists scanned the area for any trace of radiation , and the lawns became a place of pilgrimage for psychics , religious sects , and UFO experts . I viewed the videos hundreds of times , but there was nothing to learn from them . In one frame Els was in mid-stride ; in the next she was gone and her cloak was being blown inward by air rushing to fill the vacuum where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers on the space station scanned near-Earth space on every frequency that their equipment could monitor , and warplanes were almost continuously in the skies over Cadiz , but nothing was found . <p> A full two weeks later I was going through the folder of papers and statements that I had been given in those last hours before Els had vanished . There was a copy of the absurd marketing proposal for some perfume that Tormes had told me about . She came a quarter of a million years for Moon Mist fragrances - and then I had it ! <p> " Carr ! Tek orr brii ! " she had called to me . Carr . Walk to the full Moon . <p> The Rhuun could walk through time . Els had been telling me that she was going to walk through time to the next full Moon . <p> For a long time I barely moved a muscle , but I thought a great deal . There was massive development at the rear of Els 's brain . Why ? For control of movement ? For control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and escape your enemies . Escape famine , reach a time of plenty in the future . Why follow herds of wild cattle when you can wait for them to return by traveling through time ? They skipped the long glacial epochs , they visited only warmer periods . The worst of the Saale and Weischel glaciations must have been no more than a series of walks through tens of thousands of years for them . If the hunting was bad , they walked a few decades . If there was too much competition from Neanderthal or human tribes , they walked to when they had left or died out . <p> They visited the Spain of the Neanderthals , saw the coming of humans , and saw the Neanderthals vanish . That might well have made them wary of humans . Three thousand years ago they might even have seen the Phoenicians build western Europe 's first port city where Cadiz now stands , then watched as the Iberian Peninsula became part of the Roman Empire . With the development of farms came more trusting , placid cattle and sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , all that the Rhuun had to do was walk a century or so into the future whenever farmers appeared with spears , swords , and crossbows . Perhaps Ramoz 's shotgun was their first experience of a firearm , so they thought it would not be hard to defend their kill . <p> Homo sapiens evolved intelligence and had believed it to be the ultimate evolutionary advantage , but there are others . Mobility , for example . Birds can escape predators and find food by traveling through the third dimension . Homo rhuunis can do that by traveling into the fourth . Perhaps human brains are not suited to time walking , just as our hands and arms are better at making machines than flapping like wings . Could a time-walking machine be built ? Would Els be vivisected by those wanting to find out ? <p> What to do , how to do it ? I felt a curiously strong bond with Els . I had a duty to protect her , and I owed no loyalty to Tormes , Marella or even my uncle . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gave me a strangely powerful resolve . I was in love , and I cared nothing about losing everything to protect Els . <p> Nineteen days after Els vanished I was ready , waiting in a car beside the clinic 's lawns . A borrowed police car . My uncle was at home , fast asleep thanks to a couple of his own sleeping tablets in his coffee . His uniform was a rather baggy fit , but I had no choice . Every so often I started the engine , keeping it warm . On the lawns , a dozen or so UFO seekers loitered about with video cameras , mingling with the religious pilgrims , souvenir sellers , security guards , and tourists . People always returned after an alien abduction , so the popular wisdom went , and so those who followed Marella 's theory were ready . All but myself were concentrating on the skies , where the full Moon was high . <p> There was a loud pop , and Els was suddenly standing naked on the lawn . Before the echoes of her arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then scrambled out and sprinted across the lawn calling " Els ! Els ! Carr lan ! Carr lan ! " <p> She turned to me . Everyone else merely turned their cameras on us , not willing to interfere with the police . <p> " Els , hos Carr ! " I cried as I took her by the arm . She did not want to approach the police car with its flashing lights . " Els , Carr lan ! " I shouted , not sure if my intonation meant help or protect . She put a hand over her eyes and let me lead her . <p> Els had never been in a car before , and she curled up on the seat with her hands over her face . I pulled away from the clinic , turned a comer , and switched off the flashing lights . Two blocks further on , I transferred us to a rented car , and after twenty minutes we were clear of Puerto Real and in open country . Using Ramoz 's name I had located his farm in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area I had confirmed that the Field of Devils was indeed on the dead farmer 's land . I knew it was a fifty-minute drive from the clinic . I had practiced the trip several times . <p> All along Els had just needed help to return to the Field of Devils , help to move through space to where she could walk through time and rejoin her tribe in our future ... or had she stayed because of affection for me ? Whatever the case , she had only resorted to time-walking in sheer terror , when the journalists and camera crews had charged . <p> My mind was racing as I drove . Glancing down , I could see Els by the gleam of the dashboard lights . In a strange sense , I longed to call Tormes on my cell phone , to tell him what had really happened in the middle Pleistocene . The heidelbergensians had spawned two new species , not just the Neanderthals . With the Saale Glacial 's ice sheets approaching , the Neanderthals went down the tried and true path of increased intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope with the growing cold . Homo rhuunis evolved mobility in the fourth dimension instead . This instantly removed the trait from the gene pool - at least in normal time . Humanity had evolved later , but continued down the same path as the Neanderthals . <p> In the distance I could see a helicopter 's searchlight . It was hovering where we were heading : the Field of Devils . I turned off the headlights , slowed , and drove on by moonlight , but the car had already been noticed . The light in the sky approached - then passed by . The pilot was heading for where he had last seen my lights . It gave us perhaps another two minutes , Els could easily escape through time and rejoin her tribe . I would be arrested . I would lose everything for a girl of another species , and I would lose her as well . Only a modern , civilized man could manage stupidity on such a scale , but I still felt proud of myself . <p> We were only half a mile from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car . I braked hard , opened the door and pulled Els out after me . <p> " Els , tek var es bel ! " I cried as we stood in the downwash of the rotor blades , imploring her to time-walk two thousand midsummers away . <p> " Carr , Els kek ! " she pleaded , grasping my arm . <p> Kek was new to me , but this was no time to be improving my grasp of Rhuun . The helicopter was descending , an amplified voice was telling me to drop my weapons and raise my hands . <p> " Els , tek var es bel ! " I shouted again . <p> Els stepped out of the twenty-first century . <p> To me it had all been so obvious . The Rhuun could travel forward in time but take nothing with them . Their skin cloaks and tents , their stone scrapers , axes and knives , and their wooden spears and pins , everything was left behind when they time-walked . Only the person time-walking could pass into the future . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If babies could be carried through time , so could adults . <p> The brightness of the helicopter 's spotlight vanished , replaced by the half-light of dawn . I was standing naked , in long grass , with Els still holding my hand . The air was chilly but there was no wind . Els whistled , and awaited a reply . None came . The rolling hills were luridly green , and dotted with dusky sheep and cattle . It was an arcadia for Pleistocene hunters , but it was not the Pleistocene . In the distance , great snow-capped towers loomed . The air was clear and pure , and there was silence such as I had never experienced . The towers looked derelict . We were in an ice-age Spain of the very distant future , there could be no doubt of that . <p> There was a series of distant pops , like a string of fireworks exploding , and a Rhuun group appeared a few hundred meters away . Els whistled , then waved . Another tribe materialized , then another . Some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconcerned . There was plenty of game to hunt and nobody to defend it . <p> Taking my hand again , Els led me to the other Rhuun . At first I was in fear of some sort of fight to the death with her former mate , but there was no such problem . I had rescued Els when all the others had fled , and I was unattached . Within Rhuun society that gave her the right to take me as her partner , and she had no hesitation in exercising her right . In the years that followed , I became a great shaman , inventing a primitive type of writing , the bow , the bone flute , the tallow lamp , and even cave painting . When I die , however , I shall end nature 's experiment with high intelligence - once known as humanity . Humans have vanished , possibly wiped out by a genetically targeted plague , or some other doomsday weapon .. victims of their ingenuity . Sheer intelligence has not proved to be a good survival trait in the long run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth . <p> Author Affiliation
