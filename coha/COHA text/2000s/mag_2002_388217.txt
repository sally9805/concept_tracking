We know what you ate last summer - and drank - and all the other risky things you did . This year , keep safe and fit with these tips . // July and August - the **25;1071;TOOLONG months . The hazy heat makes your inner kid yearn to jump into the ocean , bake on the beach and eat burgers hot off the barbecue . And why not ? Tossing caution to the wind is part of the fun . But it also makes summer a potentially hazardous time for women , a period when you encounter a greater number of risks , including increased exposure to cancer-causing foods , body-dehydrating heat and skin-destroying ultraviolet rays . This year , play it safe . Follow these 20 simple guidelines to have all the perks of summer , without the perils : 1 corral your long hair into a ponytail or , even better , clip it up on your head when you 're grilling your favorite summer vegetables ( The do-it-yourself singe treatment can be very costly . ) Another peace-of-mind safety tips Have a bucket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADVENTURES Photograph Photograph // 2 . Start a barbecue - not a bonfire . Prevent a flaming disaster : Remember to open the lid on a gas grill before turning on the propane and lighting it . Otherwise , gas will accumulate at the bottom of the grill , inviting a flare . Second , resist the primal urge to squeeze lighter fluid directly onto burning charcoal . " The stream could ignite and cause the can to explode in your hands , " warns Betty Hughes , director of consumer affairs for barbecue maker Weber-Stephen . Or use a chimney starter or self  --  lighting charcoal ; that 's easier and safer . To order a free copy of Weber  --  Stephen 's " Girls " Guide to Grilling , " call ( 800 ) 474-5568. 3 . Do n't eat that barbecued meat before you kill the carcinogens . The seared , black char on all barbecued food contains substances called heterocyclic amines , or HCAs , which have been linked to stomach and colon cancer . To reduce HCAs , marinate raw beef , poultry or fish for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teriyaki sauce , lemon juice or water mixed with three spoonfuls of sugar and vinegar , says Althea Zanecosky , R.D. , a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association . Do n't use tomato-based marinades like barbecue sauce ; they may actually increase HCAs . Also , trim off charred meat as if it were fat . * Fruity tip : Add mashed cherries to the marinade or the ground meat , Zanecosky advises . Studies have shown this to dramatically reduce HCAs , probably because cherries are loaded with antioxidants that prevent the carcinogens from forming . * Pre-nuke your meat . Heat chicken and hamburger in a microwave oven for two minutes on high . This will precook the meat to reduce the risk of food poisoning and also reduce your grilling time . Important tip : Use fresh lean hamburger ; frozen beef can brown quickly and fool you into thinking it 's cooked . * Take its temperature . Use a meat thermometer on every piece of meat you grill - including the leftovers you 're heating today that you grilled , says ADA spokeswoman Cynthia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of beef or pork should hit 170 deg F within five minutes of eating ; chicken , 180 deg F. 4 . Keep an eye on other perishables . If it 's 80 deg F or hotter outside , toss out every perishable item ( such as mayonnaise , tuna salad , beef , chicken and other meats or egg-mixed products that can spoil ) still on your picnic table after one hour , Sass says . SCORCHING EXERCISE TIPS 5 . Go slow for the first two hot weeks . It takes your body about 10 days to become acclimated to working out in hot weather , says exercise physiologist Alan Mikesky , Ph.D . " Hot , humid environments put more stress on the cardiovascular system , " he warns . So go for a healthy break-in period : For the first three to five days , train for only 20 minutes , at around half of your usual intensity ; then slowly progress to your normal training intensity . If you are playing a team sport where you ca n't let up on intensity , take more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid going too hard . Exercise at a pace that keeps your heart rate between 55 and 80 percent of your maximum , no more . " If your heart starts beating faster and faster , you may be dehydrated and it 's time to stop exercising , " says Jill Armayor , director of wellness at the Cooper Aerobics Clinic in Dallas . 7 . Get the funk out of that water bottle . To kill bacteria and mold , fill your bottle with water , add 3 teaspoons of white vinegar , shake and rinse clean . " I noticed my bottle looking dangerous , so now I use a few different ones and run them through the dishwasher periodically , " says Sheah Rarback , M.S. , R.D. , nutritionist at the University of Miami School of Medicine and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association . Store your bottle with the cap off . Be lackadaisical here , and the colonies of oral bacteria that thrive in your water bottle may not actually make you ill , but they certainly wo n't improve the taste of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strap on your skates . If you 'll be in-line skating this summer , add one-legged squats to your gym routine . There 's no better move to condition skating muscles , build balance and prevent first-week injuries , says Heather Lacayo , 10-time national in-line-racing champ . Stand on one foot with your arms outstretched for balance and your other leg bent up behind you . Your nose should be aligned with your foot . Squat down and up for five repetitions , then switch legs . " These are tough , " Lacayo warns . Start with very shallow knee bends , then go to a full 90 degrees . Work up to 10 repetitions on each leg . 9 Wear the coolest gear If your old safety gear makes you sweat , go shopping - the new stuff is amazingly light . When you skate , always wear wrist and knee guards , and check your wheels . Pop out the bearings using a skate tool and wipe them clean with a rag . Spin the wheels . Good bearings will roll smoothly , not stick , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then make sure the " wear line " on the brake pad is still visible . If your skates are suspect , have them serviced at a skate shop . SKIN AND DIPPING 10 . Do n't go in the Jacuzzi unless ... you smell chlorine . That 's one sign it 's clean , says Chuck Gerba , Ph.D. , noted germ expert at the University of Arizona . Another test : " Dunk a plastic cup in and make sure the water is completely clear , " Gerba says . " If it looks cloudy , stay out . " Otherwise you 'll court the pseudomonas bacteria , which causes red spots on your legs and butt . " This is common in women , as tight bathing suits keep the water closer to the skin for a longer period , " Gerba says . 11 . Sport natural toenails at least one day a week . Keeping your toenails continually polished stops them from " breathing , " which makes them more susceptible to ugly fungal infections , says David Alper , D.P.M. , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fungus , wear flip-flops when you 're walking around the pool ( those puddles harbor bacteria ) and , after swimming , swab your feet with alcohol-soaked cotton balls before getting dressed . 12 do n't reduce your SPF as your tan darkens " A suntan offers some protection against the utraviolet-B rays that cause sunburn and skin cancer , but not against the uV-A radiation that causes wrinkling , " says Brett Coldrion , M.D. , a dermatologist in Cincinnati . A study review he had led found that people who tan quickly are at high risk for malignant melanoma , the deadliest skin cancer . In constrast , your pale sister wh sporadically fries herself is at greater risk for basal cell carcinoma , the milder form . " Chronic mild exposure is still the biggest risk , " Coldiron says . THe best advice , he says : Do n't tan at all . THOSE HOT SUMMER NIGHTS 13 . Have tun at the beach housejust stay out of the drinking game . " It 's not fair to women , " says David Craig , Ph.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education Project . Even if you drink less than the men , you 'll get drunk faster and that could lead you to do something stupid with someone stupid . " You have several biological disadvantages , " Craig says . First , you 're smaller and have far less water in your body to absorb the alcohol . Even more cruelly , men carry an alcohol-metabolizing enzyme ( alcohol dehydrogenase ) in their stomach that you largely lack . So , pound-for-pound , pounding will get you blitzed much quicker than the guys . Craig 's tip : If you 're drinking alcohol , stick with beer ( it has the lowest alcohol by volume ) and do n't exceed one an hour . 14 . Do n't get risky . The sweaty summer weather makes you unconsciously more willing to take sexual risks . " Hot , steamy climates make for hotter , steamier people , " says sexologist Patti Britton , Ph.D. , author of Adventures of Her in France ( Leopard Rising , 2001 ) . " Wearing fewer clothes makes us literally more open , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Unsafe sex is a far more prevalent risk than many would imagine ; one survey found that more than one in four women admit they 've allowed an occasional sex partner to forgo a condom - risking HIV , herpes or other sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) not to mention pregnancy in many cases . A study at the University of New Orleans identified the three most common ploys that men and - more surprisingly - women used or were suckered by to have unsafe sex . The first was one party asking to go " au naturel " for sensation 's sake . The second biggest con was swearing that pregnancy was impossible as long as the male pulled out ( and men were n't the only ones who used this line ! ) . Third was the solemn , before-God proclamation to be STD-free , omitting the fact that most people with STDs have no clue they 're infected . Be smart : Carry condoms yourself , and do n't entertain any sales pitches to go " au naturel . " DO N'T BE AN ACCIDENTAL TOURIST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've read about the disturbing outbreaks of diseases like West Nile encephalitis and dengue fever in areas where they had not been seen previously ( such as Buenos Aires and even New York City ) . These diseases usually strike native residents who stay for prolonged periods in affected areas , rather than tourists who are just passing through , says Paul Epstein , M.D. , M.P.H. , a global-warming expert at Harvard University Medical School . Take these precautions when traveling , nonetheless : Check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention travel Web site at cdc.gov/travel/ well in advance to see if there are any specific warnings or vaccine recommendations for your intended destination . * Call your doctor to make sure all your immunizations are up to date . The CDC generally recommends you get necessary shots no later than four to six weeks before traveling so they have enough time to take effect . For more info , visit cdc.gov/od/nvpo/ . SAFE AT THE BEACH 16 . Do n't become shark bait ! Last summer 's headlines made it seem as if sharks were terrorizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media hype . " It was actually a pretty average year for sharks , " says George Burgess , director of the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History . There were 85 shark attacks worldwide and 12 fatalities reported in 2000 , but only 70 attacks and three deaths in 2001 . Your odds of getting nipped by Jaws are too microscopic to even warrant a smirk . But since you smirked , heed these pointers : * Forget about the midnight swim . " Sharks feed at night , " says Burgess . Dusk and dawn are also chow times , so do your swimming at midday . * Do n't surf at New Smyrna Beach , near Daytona Beach , Fla . Fully 22 of Florida 's 36 shark attacks in 2001 occurred here , all involving young males . For some reason , the feeder fish , warm water and shark activity here made it an unappealing spot to young female surfers. * Never swim if you see fish jumping . Where fish jump , sharks munch . * Do n't wear jewelry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting glints look like little fish to sharks and barracuda , " Burgess says . * If a shark swims near you , stay still . It might think you 're a rock or a slab of driftwood . There 's a reason there are few sharks in Mensa . 17 . Shuffle when you walk in the ocean . This will scare off stingrays which are far more likely to sting you ( causing pain akin to an angry bumblebee ) than a shark is to bite you . 18 . Ask a lifeguard about the riptide . If it carries you out , swim at a 45  --  degree angle back to the beach . Tired ? Float with the current . It 'll stop not far from the shore , where you can flag a lifeguard . " Do n't exhaust yourself trying to fight the riptide , " warns David Price , director of the San Diego branch of the California Lifeguard Association . " That 's why people drown , not because they get carried out 500 feet . " 19 . Master a safety move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Price says . Curl yourself into a fetal position and float on your stomach , with your arms around your knees . Occasionally lift your head to breathe . You can float all day in this position , conserving your energy to swim periodically or wait for help . 20 . Take a lesson before riding that rented Jet Ski . " People assume it 's like riding a bike , so they start jetting around as fast as they like , " Price says . " But they do n't realize that Jet Skis have no brakes . Until they smash Minimize risk of injury and skate or Photograph Sidebar cycle safely : Wear a ventilated helmet with an ANSI or SNELL safety rating .
