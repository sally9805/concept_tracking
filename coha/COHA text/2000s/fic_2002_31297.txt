Doc Voss 's folks were farmers of German descent , Mennonite pacifists who ran a few head of Brahman outside of Deaf Smith , Texas , and raised beans and melons and tomatoes and paid their taxes and generally went their own way . When Doc got his draft notice his senior year in high school , a lot of us thought he might apply for exemption as a conscientious objector . Instead , Doc enlisted in the Navy and became a hospital corpsman attached to the Marines . Then he got hooked up with Force Reconnaissance and ended up a SEAL and both a helicopter and fixed-wing pilot who did extractions on the Cambodian border . In fact , Doc became one of the most decorated participants in the Vietnam War . The night Doc returned home he burned his uniform in the backyard of his house , methodically hanging each piece from a stick over a fire that swirled out of a rusted oil drum , dissolving his Marine-issue tropicals into glowing threadworms . He joined a fundamentalist church , one even more radical in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give witness , he rose in the midst of the congregation and calmly recited a story of a village incursion that made his fellow parishioners in the slat-board church house weep and tremble . At the end of harvest season he disappeared into Mexico . We heard rumors that Doc was an addict , living in a hut on the Bay of Campeche , his mind gone , his hair and beard like a lion 's mane , his body pocked with sores . I received a grimed , pencil-written postcard from him that read : " Dear Billy Bob , Do n't let the politicians or the generals get you . I swim with dolphins in the morning . The ocean is full of light and the dolphins speak to me as one of their own . At least I think they do . " Your bud , the guy who used to be Tobin Voss .

Before we knew it , Doc graduated and went on to Baylor and received a medical degree . We stopped worrying about Doc , in an almost self-congratulatory way , as you do when an errant relative finally becomes what you thought he should have always been . Doc never talked about the war , except in a collection of poems he published , then in a collection of stories based on the poems , one that perhaps a famous film director stole from in producing an award-winning movie about the Vietnam War . Doc ran a clinic in Deaf Smith and married a girl from Montana . When he lost her in a plane crash five years ago , he handled tragedy in his own life as he had handled the war . He did n't talk about it . Nor of the fires that had never died inside him or the latent potential for violence that the gentleness in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
