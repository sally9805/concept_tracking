The time Anne left her husband , she went to France . She spent the first few days in Paris at an inexpensive hotel in the sixth arrondissement on rue Jacob . Her room was small and sparsely furnished ; the bathroom , too , was small , the shower produced a tepid trickle . Instead of looking out onto the busy street , the single window in Anne 's room gave out onto the back of the hotel , onto an empty courtyard where half a dozen large cats had convened to sun themselves-although it was late October and the days were getting shorter , darker . Right away Anne had planned to visit museums , churches , cathedrals , go to the top of the Eiffel Tower , but her first day in Paris she could hardly get out of bed . When finally she did , she stood at the window and watched the cats . She did not feel depressed so much as she felt absent . She did not think about her husband , George , or her daughters , or what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation Anne had given before she left , was that the two girls were old enough to look after themselves and George would just have to cope with the groceries , the cooking , the washing , whatever Anne did all day . Making a vague fanning motion with her hand , Anne told George , she needed air . <p> The second day Anne roused herself and walked from Sainte Chapelle , to Notre Dame , to the Louvre ; the third day it rained , and Anne bought a lot of clothes : a dress , a suede jacket , a pair of trousers , two silk blouses , all of them expensive ; she charged them to George . She was also starting to feel lonely . ( Except for a fat man sitting at the next table in a restaurant who asked Anne if she recommended her canard a l'orange-not looking up from the magazine she was reading , Anne had answered a barely audible Oui-Anne had spoken to no one except salespersons and waiters . ) On the fourth day , a man followed Anne as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although her heart was pounding and she was nearly running , Anne remembered a stupid joke she had once heard about an American tourist who , in her confusion , instead of calling the man on the Metro who pinched her cochon-pig-says to him couchons-let 's sleep together . Two hours later when Anne left the hotel again to have dinner , the man was across the street still waiting for her , smoking a cigarette . Couchons ! <p> The next morning , standing at her window and looking down at the cats in the courtyard-by then , Anne had a favorite , a big marmalade cat who except for an occasional wave of his tail lay motionless for hours on his side-she called her best friend from school , Nina . <p> At the Montpellier train station , Anne , her large suitcase at her feet , waited for Nina . As usual Nina was late , and Anne was reminded of all the times Nina had kept her waiting , in particular the time that had led to her meeting George since she could no longer keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nina indefinitely . At last Anne saw Nina . Her raincoat buttoned up the wrong way , she was running down the platform , waving . <p> " You look just the same , " Anne said , kissing Nina , who looked much thinner . Her red hair was streaked with gray . <p> " So do you , " Nina answered breathlessly . " Always tres chic . " <p> In college , both Anne and Nina had majored in French ; after graduation , Nina had gone abroad to study music and had fallen in love with a musician . <p> Anne shook her head , she suddenly felt like crying . " Your children ? " she asked instead . <p> " At home , with Michel . " Michel , the musician , was already married to someone else , to a woman named Eliane , whom he could not divorce ; Nina and Michel had two small children , a girl and a boy . " Here , let me . " Nina reached for Anne 's suitcase . <p> Embarrassed all of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she handed Nina her new jacket . " Take this instead , " she said . <p> " Oh , how beautiful . Nina stroked the suede . " I 'll have to borrow it from you . She smiled . They both knew that Nina was referring to the many times in college when Nina used to borrow Anne 's clothes . Sometimes , she would borrow them without asking . <p> " No , keep it , I mean it , " Anne said . As she opened the door to Nina 's car , a large white dog lying on the front seat raised his head . <p> " Git , July ! Get in the back , " Nina ordered the dog . " She followed us from the beach last summer , the children insisted on keeping her . Do n't go near her , she sheds . " The back seat of Nina 's car was littered with toys , a discarded sweater , a pair of shoes , food wrappers . " Do n't mind the mess , " Nina also said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nina had been incapable of putting her own clothes away or back where they belonged-in the closet or in the bureau drawers . Nina left everything trailing on chairs or lying on the floor . But it was her sweetness more than anything else that had attracted Anne , and Nina 's selflessness-she had a kind of otherworldliness , a total lack of ego-was how Anne would describe her later . <p> " How many people live in however you pronounce the name of your village ? " Anne asked as Nina started up the car . The village Nina lived in was a few miles north of Montpellier . <p> " St. Guilhem-le-Desert , " Nina enunciated the name for Anne . " About two hundred , except on weekends and holidays , then it is more like two million people . The Cevennes has become a big tourist center for walking and climbing . Also , you would be surprised at the number of pilgrims . " <p> " Pilgrims ? " <p> " Yes , they come to worship a three-inch piece of the True Cross which Charlemagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knights , a man named Guilhem who built an abbey you can visit if you like . Now a community of Carmelite nuns lives where the original abbey-oh , I do n't mean to go on about the local sights . " Nina reached with one hand to touch Anne 's arm . " Tell me , " she asked , " how 's George ? " <p> " I think I 've left him , " Anne said , turning to the side window so that Nina could not see her face . " Nothing is settled yet . But go on , I like hearing about where you live . " <p> " There 's a castle we can visit , too , " Nina told Anne after a while . <p> " Oh , what a pretty village , " Anne exclaimed as Nina was parking the car . " It looks as if your house was built back in the Middle Ages . " <p> " It was . " Nina laughed . " There 's practically no heat in winter , and there 's just enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like camping out . " <p> " I 'm just so happy to see you , " Anne said , getting out of the car and brushing at her skirt , which was covered with white dog hair . <p> Nina 's children , Sophie and Paul , were sitting at the kitchen table coloring in a book . Michel , a big man in a red wool check shirt , was wearing a headset and listening to music ; he did not hear Nina and Anne come in . <p> " Hello , cheri ! " Nina shouted . <p> Anne stood at the door and smiled at the children , who were staring at her . July , the dog , trotted past her , and Sophie , the little girl who was eight , got down from the chair and knelt in front of the dog and put her arms around the dog 's neck . <p> " Je t'aime , " she crooned . <p> Michel looked up , then he turned off the music and took off the headset . <p> Anne went up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Michel . " <p> " How was your trip , Anne ? " he answered , his English heavily accented . Then Michel turned to the children . " Anne , here , went to school with maman when maman was a girl . " Michel spoke as if this was the first time Anne 's name had been mentioned in their family . " She lives in America , do n't you , Anne ? " <p> Anne nodded . <p> " Come , let me show you to your room , " Nina said . <p> Anne 's room was Sophie 's , and Sophie had been moved into Paul 's room . The bed was a narrow child 's bed , and the quilt on it was covered with faded figures of Babar . Once Nina had gone back downstairs , Anne set her suitcase at the foot of the bed and opened it ; all her clothes , sweaters , skirts , jackets , were carefully wrapped in tissue to keep them from wrinkling . There was no closet in the room , only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , and Anne decided not to unpack after all . Instead she took out her flowered toilet kit and went down the hall to the only bathroom . When she tried to lock the bathroom door , she found the lock did not turn . <p> In the afternoon , Michel left to play in his band in Montpellier , and Nina drove Sophie to a ballet lesson . Anne stayed with Paul , who turned on an old black-and-white television to watch cartoons . The picture had a grainy quality she remembered from her own childhood . <p> When Anne woke up it took her a few seconds to remember where she was . " Paul ? " <p> " He 's here " Nina said from the doorway . " You fell asleep . " From the remarks of the two children , Anne realized that Paul had left the television and gone outside to pile stones on the side of the road . She was frightened all of a sudden . " I ca n't believe I did that , " she said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As the youngest , Paul has a highly developed sense of self-preservation , and there 's never much traffic on our street . Look how this fits me . " She twirled around in Anne 's suede jacket , then she mentioned dinner and said , " You must be starving , Anne . I told you , did n't I , that Michel is a vegetarian ? " <p> " Do you have anything to drink ? Some wine ? " Anne , after a while , asked Nina as Nina was boiling water for the spaghetti . <p> " Wine ? Oh , gee , I 'm sorry . I 'll ask Michel to get you some tomorrow . " <p> " It does n't matter . I just thought if you did-that 's all . Here , " Anne also said , " let me do something useful . " <p> As Anne was setting the table , she could hear Nina humming in the kitchen . Nina had a beautiful singing voice-when she sang , everyone said , Nina was transformed ; Nina became powerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even though she was fairly certain of the answer , Anne called out to Nina in the next room , " Are you still singing ? " <p> That night in bed , underneath the too-flimsy Babar quilt , Anne kept all her clothes on except for her shoes , the room was so damp and cold . And disoriented , she did not sleep much . She heard Michel come up the stairs-by the luminous hands on her watch , which she had never bothered to change , it was ten o'clock in the morning on the east coast of the United States-and for a moment she confused him with George , about whom she had been dreaming . ( In the dream , she was in a crowded room , at a party perhaps , where George , who did not smoke , was smoking and offering everyone in the room a cigarette-a special blend , George kept saying in a boastful and unfamiliar way . ) Later , at seven and while it was still dark , she heard Nina get the children ready for school ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then she got up and dressed-she merely put on another sweater-and brushed her hair . On her way downstairs , she stopped in the bathroom . Wearing only the red check shirt , Michel was sitting on the toilet , looking through a magazine . <p> " Oh ! " Embarrassed , Anne quickly shut the bathroom door . Michel had barely glanced up . " Pas de probleme , " he said . <p> " How about a walk ? " Nina suggested when she got back later that morning . " We can go up to the castle , but it 's a bit of a hike . I 'll take July-good exercise for her . " <p> Rue du Bout-du-Monde-end of the world road , Nina translated for Anne-was the name of the road they were walking on , and it was so steep and narrow Anne was grateful that she had on her walking shoes . Even so , she kept slipping on the loose stones and pebbles . Around them , the countryside consisted of sharp limestone hills covered with impenetrable scrub and oak thickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first met . I guess that 's why I did n't notice how steep it is , " Nina said with a little laugh . She had July on a leash , and the dog was pulling her . <p> " I imagine it helps to be a goat , " Anne said . <p> " A sheep , you mean . In summer , the place is filled with them . Each year the shepherds bring up their flocks , and you should see all the lambs- " Nina stopped . " But I really want to hear about you , Anne . " <p> " The two girls are all right , I guess , " Anne began in an expressionless voice . " They 're in school , they 're getting good grades , and they 've already decided on careers : Danielle wants to be a doctor , Joyce a lawyer . " <p> " And George ? Is there someone else ? " <p> Anne shook her head . " Sometimes , I wish there were . There 's nothing I can really point a finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just so trivial and predictable . And I guess it always boils down to the same thing-sex , which in our case is nearly nonexistent . I know , I know , I am being incredibly spoiled , but I want more , and I want it to be different . " <p> " Different is not necessarily better , " Nina said . <p> They walked on in silence ( except for Nina occasionally telling July to stop or to been until they reached the top of the ridge and the ruined castle-all that remained of it was the curtain wall and the sixty-foot-high keep faced with huge limestone blocks-but the view more than anything else drew them . The sheer drop from the cliff and the gorge hundreds of feet below . <p> " So what happened to Guilhem ? " Anne asked . <p> " After his wife died , Guilhem gave up all his worldly possessions and became a monk . He spent the rest of his life in a cell , fasting , praying " - far down in the village , a church bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legend , ' Nina continued , " when Guilhem died , all the church bells began to ring at once of their own accord without anyone pulling on the ropes . " <p> Again that night Michel left to play in the band , but at dinner Nina held up a bottle of wine . She poured Anne a glass , then herself a glass as well . " I know it 's funny , " she said , " most people , including my family , think that musicians drink , smoke , they think that musicians are completely dissipated , but Michel is n't like that . And he 's a wonderful father . " <p> Anne sipped more wine . " So , you 're really happy , Nina ? " <p> Nina shrugged . " Happy ? Sure , I 'm happy . I miss a lot of things . I wish Michel did not have to struggle so hard to get work . But I love him , and I love the children . " <p> Except for saying good morning and goodbye and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had barely spoken to Michel . " You do n't mind not being married ? " <p> " I do n't think about it anymore . And , in a funny way , I like Eliane . Sophie and Paul like her , too . " <p> Again , that night , Anne could not get to sleep , but instead of tossing and turning under the too-thin Babar quilt , she turned on the light and read in a guidebook how first Guilhem captured the city of Nimes by hiding his soldiers in wine barrels and then how he lost the tip of his nose fighting off the pagans in Rome . Later , Anne woke up to find the light on in her room and , after a moment of confusion , to the sounds of Michel and Nina making love . Couchons ! Anne half-wished she had asked the man who had followed her in Paris-he was not bad-looking in a foreign sort of way-to have a drink with her ; it would have been easy . <p> " What kind of music do you play ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children to school , and Michel was making coffee in the kitchen . " Rock ? " <p> Michel nodded . " Whatever people want to hear . Tu veux du cafe , Anne ? " <p> " I 'd love to hear you play , " Anne went on , handing Michel her cup . " Maybe , one of these nights . My husband-you should meet him- " she heard herself say , " he 's a great- " How to explain the word fan ? - Anne 's voice trailed off . <p> When Nina got back to the house , she had a headache , the start of migraine , she said . <p> " I hope it was n't the wine , " Anne said . <p> Nina shook her head . " I 'll be fine later . " She smiled at Anne , but her eyes were watery and unfocused . " I just need some sleep , " she said . <p> " Do n't worry about me , Nina . I 'll go for a walk , " Anne said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she added too late  --  Nina was halfway up the stairs and did not hear her . <p> " You can walk to the Grotte de Clamouse , " Michel told Anne after Nina had gone . <p> " The grotte ? Is it a cave ? " <p> Michel nodded . " It 's only three kilometers from here . I can start you on your way , if you like . Show you a shortcut , so you wo n't have to walk on the main road . " <p> " That 's very kind of you , " Anne answered . " I 'll just go and put on my walking shoes . " <p> When Anne returned downstairs , Michel was wearing a different shirt , a blue cotton dress shirt . <p> " Some of the caves are so far underground they have never seen the light of day , yet bunches of green ferns are growing inside them , " Michel told Anne as they set off through the village . " Also , you will see beautiful crystals in the shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Aragoneat ? " Anne repeated after him . She felt stupid . She knew nothing about caves or crystals . <p> " Sometimes my father worked as a guide , he took tourists inside the caves . He had the good fortune to go on several exploratory expeditions with Martel . " When Anne did not answer , Michel continued , " Edouard-Alfred Martel , the famous , how do you say , speleogiste . " <p> " Ah , yes . Speleogiste . " Anne felt as if she were having a conversation with someone from another planet ; uncharacteristically , she was tempted to laugh . She bent her head so that Michel could not see her while she tried to compose her face . After a while , she asked , " Your father is from this region ? This region ? " Anne repeated it the French way . <p> They had reached the outskirts of the village , and instead of answering her , Michel pointed out a path which ran parallel to the main road . " One of the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a boy I went every summer with my father when he took up the ships . " <p> " Yes . Sheep , Nina told me how- " Anne started to say when , without warning , Michel took her in his arms and tried to kiss her on the mouth . Letting out a cry of surprise , Anne shook herself free . <p> Anne had tied a scarf around her head . Now the ends of the scarf whipped around and hit her face , startling her . The day , which had started out mild , had turned chilly all of a sudden , and the wind had picked up . Fast-moving clouds hid the sun ; any moment it looked as if it was going to rain . No one else was on the path , which no longer ran parallel to the road but wound more and more steeply up the hillside , who knew to where ? And who would find her if she twisted an ankle or broke a leg ? There were no signs or markers , and Anne was angry at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road instead . Also , she was angry at Michel . Fool , she thought , not sure whom she meant . Then she stopped so abruptly she almost lost her balance . She had been about to step on something that she could not immediately identify-a mass of dirty white wool . <p> A year to the day nearly after Anne left St. Guilhem-le-Desert , Nina died of a brain tumor-the cause of the headaches , Anne supposed . Michel had telephoned her at two o'clock one morning-eight o'clock in St. Guilhem-le-Desert-to let her know , and it took Anne , who was in bed asleep next to George , a while to understand who Michel was and what he was telling her . " What time is it there ? " she had said foolishly at the same time that she thought , or perhaps imagined , she heard bells ringing in the background . And what had Nina told her about the church bells ringing of their own accord ? Next , still only half-awake , Anne asked Michel if there was anything she could do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my wife , " Michel said . " Eliane . Perhaps this time we can work it out . " <p> The dead sheep had been lying right across her path-underneath the matted wool , Anne had seen a row of startlingly white rib bones , underneath the rib bones , she had seen the ground . The sheep must have been dead for quite some time . Anne had to step over the dead sheep or else go back down . <p> Author Affiliation
