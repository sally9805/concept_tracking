Three years ago , Appleton Paper Co. decided to make money . An excellent pursuit for a company , you would think . But as with all businesses , not so easy as it sounds . The money in question is U.S. currency , more specifically the very high-tech paper used to print it . The Appleton , Wis. , papermaker planned an expensive makeover to compete for the $400 million contract to supply the government with currency paper when the contract went up for bid this spring . Appleton , an employee-owned company , figured to spend more than $70 million upgrading one of its three paper mills , enabling it to produce watermarks , machine-readable micropatterns and embedded threads and metal fibers  --  the gold standard in anticounterfeiting technology . " We see it as a way to serve our country at the same time we expand our business , " says spokesman Bill Van Den Brandt . <P> But history is not on Appleton 's side . Since 1879 , one company , the family-run papermaker Crane &; Co. , has produced virtually all U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ever evolving security features , at two facilities in Dalton , Mass . " Ours is an intimate , long working relationship with the Treasury Department , " says Lansing Crane , CEO and **26;19654;TOOLONG of the company 's founder . That relationship appears as secure as ever , despite challenges from competitors and lawmakers that have been mounting since 2001 . Having one firm control the currency supply is n't just anticompetitive , it 's a security risk , they argue . That may not be enough to break one of the last monopolies in American business . <P> The Bureau of Engraving and Printing , an arm of the U.S. Treasury , produces 35 million notes a day with a face value of approximately $635 million at its two printing facilities  --  in Washington and Fort Worth , Texas  --  and all those greenbacks are printed on paper supplied by Crane and shipped by truck from Massachusetts . Any interruption in that production could be " devastating to the U.S. economy , " Van Den Brandt says . <P> The Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier could be greater assurance of a steady supply of goods , even if one site were disrupted by a strike , natural disaster , bankruptcy or terrorist attack , " GAO investigators wrote in 2005 . <P> Crane replies that its 127-year knowledge of the currency supply enhances security . Although the company is best known among consumers for its fine stationery and other paper products , about 60% of the company 's 1,200 employees are involved in the day-to-day production of currency paper . " The majority of our employees ' time and effort goes toward making a single product that we can sell to a single customer , " Lansing Crane says . " We 're going to do everything we can to keep doing that for as long as possible . "
