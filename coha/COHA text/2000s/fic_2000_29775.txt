Northern Eritrea The Toyota was a speck in the vastness of the desert , moving just ahead of the billowing dust of its wake . The twin scars of its tire prints ran off to the infinity of the horizon . Other than the truck , nothing moved in the desertno animal or bird , no lizard or crawling insect ventured out into the torturous heat . While rain fell on the eastern part of the country and angry masses of clouds were visible in the distance , the storms had not yet come to the Hajar region . The desert floor was cracked , split open in a natural process that tripled its surface area and would allow a greater amount of water to be absorbed when it finally did rain . It was as if the soil itself needed the precious water to survive . Mercer drove recklessly , trusting his own reactions and the vehicle 's speed in case they drove over any of the anti- personnel mines sown on the open plain . If they hit a larger antitank mine , nothing he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , his hand braced against the dash while Selome grimly gripped a ceiling strap in the back , her eyes riveted out the rear window . " Do you see them yet ? " Mercer shouted over the engine 's roar . " No , not yet , " Selome replied hoarsely . " Oh shit , I see them now . " Mercer shifted his gaze to the rearview mirror for a second and spied the pursuing four-wheel drive . At this distance , it was only a sparkling reflection , a jewel pinned to the desert by dust blowing up behind it . " Sorry , guys , " he called darkly . " I do n't think we 're going to make it . " They had started their drive from the camp two hours after dawn . Mercer andHabte , with the help of Abebe , had laid the explosive charges Mercer had fashioned during the night by premixing the ammonium nitrate and fuel oil in a dozen one- gallon metal cans . At dawn , the three of them had dug holes into the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots and tumble the overhanging walls of their excavation . Once the holes had been dug and the charges buried , they scrambled back to ground level , moved the vehicles to a safe distance , and waited while Mercer made the final connections to the battery-driven detonator . He called the countdown but gave Gibby the honor of shooting the amfo . The boy had practically begged . The fuses burned at twelve thousand feet per second , so it seemed the detonations were instantaneous , but a cascade compression wave had been created in the rock that built steadily in fractions of seconds . If Gibby was disappointed by the small geysers of dirt thrown up by the detonation , he was delighted by their final results . The man-made chasm they had laboriously dug into the mountain collapsed inward at the same instant the bulk of material above let go , creating a long-slide avalanche that carried tons of dirt nearly four hundred yards from the slope . Gibby let out a whoop that echoed even as the rumble subsided . Abebe , Habte , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a victorious shout . The blast had been better than even he had anticipated . " Okay , boys , you know what to do , " Mercer said . It would take two days to remove the rubble from the blast , but when the arduous task was finished , they could continue to chip away at the mountain to expose the mine entrance without fear of a cave-in . Mercer had set the charges high enough on the hillside to ensure that the blast went outward rather than into the mountain , so he was not concerned with damaging the ancient workings below . Selome and Gibby had left the Valley of Dead Children with Mercer while Habte and the others tore into the heaps of debris . They had packed for a couple of days in case it took them longer to find the monastery , but Gibby assured Mercer that he could locate it quickly . It was Selome who had first spotted the other vehicle . She had noticed it when they were no more than half an hour away from the entrance to the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , " he said . " It could be another survey team looking for minerals that just happen to be in the same area , " Selome suggested lamely . Mercer did n't waste the time to respond . As soon as he saw the truck cresting a hill behind them , he 'd started to accelerate . Immediately , the other vehicle took up the chase . Once , when the other truck had gained enough ground for them to recognize it as a Fiat , a winking light appeared in the passenger-side window . An instant later , feathers of dust exploded in the wake of the fleeing Toyota ; mid-caliber machine-gun fire . No matter how hard Mercer pushed their battered Toyota , the pursuing truck was quicker . It was only Mercer 's driving skills and his ability to read the terrain that had kept them out of weapon 's range again . But now , out in the open , the Fiat was rapidly closing . " What do you mean , we 're not going to make it ? " Selome asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A gust of wind nearly tore the steering wheel from his grip . When he was back in control , he continued . " There 's no place to lose them out here because our tire prints and the dust this pig is kicking up are going to give us away . " Neither Selome nor Gibby could argue . " Another happy fact , " Mercer said after a minute of silence , " is the land mines . If this region is covered with them , which everyone tells me it is , we 're going to hit one . It 's just a matter of time . " Even an anti-personnel variant would stop the Toyota dead . " Maybe those guys behind us will hit one first . " " Not if they drive in our tracks . " Another blast of wind hit the Toyota . On a horizon that was rushing toward them , the storm clouds piled into towering walls that blocked the distance like dark curtains . It was frightening , an awesome display of natural fury . " How long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , " Gibby shouted over the wind whipping through the Toyota 's open windows . " I have seen storms like that stay over one area for days and not move at all . " " Are you kidding me ? " " It 's true , " Selome yelled from the backseat . " These storms usually hug the ground and ca n't get over the mountains . Often , rain wo n't fall from them for days , even weeks . " " That means the air in front of them compresses against the hills and springs back , creating " Mercer 's voice was choked off as the air around the truck came alive . The sandstorm blew up so suddenly and violently that the trio was coughing before they could close the windows . The Land Cruiser filled with a dark amber light that shifted constantly as the storm raged over them . The sky screamed as sand was stripped off the surface of the desert and blown thousands of feet into the air . Mercer slowed the Toyota , his visibility down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm unbelievably intensified . Already the windshield was opaque . Selome gave a little cry from the backseat and Gibby stared goggle-eyed into the maelstrom . The wind shoved the Toyota so hard it felt as if they were still speeding over the broken ground . " Selome , how far behind was the other truck ? " Mercer shouted . " I do n't remember . " " Come on , " he prompted . He could see the terror in her eyes when he twisted around to look at her . " Just give me your best guess . " " Half a mile , maybe . " " All right . The storm 's going to erase our tire tracks , but we 're still too close to the Fiat . When this mess blows over , they 're going to spot us in a second . " " What can we do ? " Gibby asked . " We 're going to continue on . " Mercer 's jaw clenched with determination . " But you ca n't see , " Selome cried . " Sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck . " The joke felt flat to Mercer 's ears too . He replayed the last image of the desert he 'd seen before the dust had obscured it , studied it in his mind , and engaged the transmission , gambling that the driver of the other truck would n't budge until after the storm had passed . The Toyota crept forward , Mercer driving from memory . The desert floor had been relatively flat before the storm had hit , so he was n't overly worried about any sudden drops or dips , but as the wind pummeled the side of the Land Cruiser , keeping them on a straight course was next to impossible . Ten minutes trickled by , the Land Cruiser crawling blindly through the twisting slashes of wind and sand , Mercer 's hand slick on the steering wheel , his body attuned to any attitude shifts that would signal a hill or a valley . Then as suddenly as it had started , the storm blew over them and they were in the clear . Even before his eyes could adjust to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flinging Gibby and Selome back in their seats . They had a precious few minutes before the sand settled around their pursuers . " Selome , keep your eye out for that Fiat and tell me the instant you see it . " There was a series of low hills a half mile ahead , and Mercer was hoping that they would be behind them before she saw the other vehicle . If the three of them were spotted first , it would all be over . " Anything ? " " No , the storm is still hanging on back there . I ca n't see them . I think- " The Toyota catapulted in the air , throwing off smoking hunks of body work and bits of its undercarriage . The thunder of the explosion drowned out the screams of the passengers . Crashing on its three remaining tires , the Land Cruiser flipped on its side , its front fender plowing a deep furrow into the soil . A " perfect soldier " had waited decades to strike its deadly blow . Designed as an antipersonnel weapon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Toyota , and because of the vehicle 's speed , much of the detonative force was released under the engine rather than below the wheel that had activated its primer . With most of its energy absorbed by the engine block , only a tenth of the charge blasted into the cab . It was more than enough . The last thing Mercer remembered clearly was the sound of Selome 's voice . Then he was assaulted by a jumbled whirl of images , screams , and pain , the earth erupting under the Land Cruiser and the jarring crush as it slammed into the ground again . His ears ringing , Mercer wiped his face , and his trembling hand came away covered with blood . His whole body ached as his senses slowly returned . He could n't feel the pain that would indicate a wound capable of producing the amount of blood splattered on his clothes . His first thought was Selome . He tried to turn and check on her , but he could n't move from where he was wedged under the steering wheel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Gibby . Or what was left of him . The explosion had been channeled into the passenger-side foot well , shredding the boy 's legs so badly that only a few stringy bits of flesh kept them attached to his body . Massive tissue trauma had killed him immediately , but ropes of blood still drooled from the ragged wounds , pouring onto Mercer , saturating him . Seeing the dead Eritrean sharpened Mercer 's mind , and vomit flooded his mouth . He choked it back painfully . " Selome ? " he called . She was sobbing . Thank God ! Slowly , he eased Gibby 's body off him . When he stood on the smashed-in door , a wave of nausea nearly dropped him back on top of the corpse . He ignored any injuries he might have and concentrated on Selome . She lay curled on the driver's-side rear door , her face cupped in her hands , her shoulders heaving . Mercer called her name again and finally she looked up . Her face was filthy , her hair bushed around her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were made enormous by fear , she did n't appear to be in shock . " Give me your hand . " He had n't forgotten the Fiat still behind them . " We have to get out of here . " She reached for him tentatively , and as soon as her fingers laced with his , Mercer pulled her to her feet . She winced when her weight pressed against her right foot , the one closest to the explosion . " Are you okay ? " " I do n't know . " Her voice was small and frail . " We have to get moving . That other truck will be on us in no time . " Mercer looked beyond the shattered rear window and saw a plume of dust speeding out of the shifting sandstorm like some questing tentacle . The Fiat was too distant to see yet , but Mercer knew he only had minutes before it reached them . " Give me your gun , " he demanded quickly . " What ? " " Your gun , Selome , give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Her acting job was unconvincing . " We have about five minutes before they reach us , and if you want to live beyond then , give me your goddamned gun . " She stared at him , her face a mixture of fear and confusion , then she reached into her knapsack to retrieve a big automatic . " How did you know ? " Even in this situation , Mercer felt relief that the wall of secrecy between them was starting to come down . " I 'll tell you later . You know , we could have used this in the cattle pens in Asmara . " Mercer took the Heckler and Koch . Selome shrugged but could n't meet his eye . Mercer levered himself out of the destroyed four-wheel drive , twisted on his perch , and lowered his hand back to Selome . " Climb up to me . I 'll help you , but do n't look in the front seat . Gibby did n't make it . " The Fiat 's trail of dust no longer merged with the storm dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his arms , and Selome leaped to him . " Stay here . " At the back of the Toyota , a five-gallon jerry can of gasoline was clamped tightly in a special bracket . Mercer unclipped it from its mounts , grabbed a pair of knapsacks that had been tossed from the roof storage rack , and returned to Selome 's side . The crater left by the landmine looked like a tiny , smoking volcano . He judged that the Land Cruiser had been thrown nearly fifteen feet by the blast . " What are we going to do ? We 're in the middle of a mine field . " Mercer did n't answer her question , nor could he ignore it either . The desert here was loose and sandy , the surface raked smooth by the storm . However , there was a rocky outcrop about fifty yards away that would be free of mines . The trick was to get from the stranded Toyota to the rocks without blowing themselves up and doing it quickly enough so the pursuing Fiat did n't discover their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began dumping its contents onto the Land Cruiser . " Mercer , I need to get " He cut her off . " No time . I 'm sorry . " The Fiat was about a half mile away ; its roof was visible as it drove in a shallow depression . Mercer scanned the ground as he worked , hoping to see the imprints of mines , but praying he 'd never see another one again . Finished dousing the vehicle , he led her a few yards away , using its battered hulk to cover their escape . Whenever he was working in the field , Mercer carried half a dozen cigarette lighters with him . It was a safety precaution that went way beyond the Boy Scout motto , but he 'd been in situations where he 'd needed all of them . Using his left hand , he sparked open a Zippo and tossed it underhand into the pool of gasoline beneath the Toyota . In a continuous motion , he began shooting into the ground as a whooshing explosion engulfed the four-wheel-drive , masking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed them as they stood in the open . Selome tried to move away from the raging flames , but Mercer held her wrist tightly . He fired off the entire magazine , walking his shots toward the boulders a short way off , each bullet plowing a small crater in the dirt roughly five feet beyond the previous one . Had a round hit a mine , it would have carried the power to detonate the charge , but there was no secondary explosion . Mercer released Selome 's hand and jumped into the first pock created by the 9mm bullets . " Land where I step , " he cautioned and jumped again , leaping into the next shallow depression . It took every bit of his balance to land in the tiny craters , teetering on one foot for breathless seconds , his arms windmilling until he could center himself again . Then he would leap to the next , Selome at his heels . Unencumbered by the two knapsacks Mercer carried , Selome bounded easily , her long legs covering the distance with the grace of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't let it show . " Give me another clip , " Mercer said when he reached the last impact hole . " That 's what I wanted to go back for , " Selome answered . " The rest of my ammo was in the Toyota . I do n't have any more . " Mercer 's eyes went wide as he stared at the seventy-five feet of open space separating them from the safety of the rocks ; seventy-five feet of mine-sown no-man 's land with only one way across . He could n't hear the engine noise of the approaching Fiat over the fiery eruption behind them , but he knew only a few seconds remained before the vehicle rumbled into view . Mercer took the deep , final breath of a man bent on suicide . Fighting an instinct to yell and vent some of the pent-up emotion , he started running . It took his entire will not to stretch his gait to its fullest . He had to leave footprints close enough for Selome to use as stepping stones . With every step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at full swing ; a shearing pain that at best would kill him and at worst would immobilize him for the pursuers to finish the job . He covered the first half of the distance without incident , but took no solace from this . The law of averages was working against him , and with every step , the ratio tipped more and more out of his favor . With just ten more feet to cover , he moaned aloud in frustration for not being able to leap those last few yards . He could have done it in a flying dive , but again he thought of Selome and took a step that cut the distance in half and made it safe for her . Click .
