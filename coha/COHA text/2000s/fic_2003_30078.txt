AUGUST 1912 LONDON The prisoner was standing in the dock , face strained , eyes on the foreman of the jury . His fingers gripped the wooden railing , white-knuckled , as he tried to hear the portly , gray-haired man in the jurors ' box reading the verdict . But the roaring in his ears as his heart pounded hard enough to suffocate him seemed to shut out the words . He swallowed hard , then leaned forward a little , concentrating on the juror 's lips . "  - -  guilty on all charges --  " The foreman 's voice rose on the last four words , as if he found them distasteful , his glance furtively flicking toward the accused and away again . A greengrocer , he was not sympathetic to theft and murder . The prisoner 's face swung toward the judge as he lifted the black silk square and settled it neatly on his heavy white wig , prepared to pass sentence . " . . . taken from this place . . . hung by the neck . . . " The prisoner blanched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gallery watching , her gloved hands clenched tightly in her lap . But she offered no comfort , staring straight ahead . Her face was closed and empty . He could n't look away . His sister , on the far side of his wife , was weeping into her handkerchief , hunched into her grief , but he hardly noticed . It was his wife 's coldness that riveted him . He thought , " She believes it now --  " Inspector Ian Rutledge , the young officer from the Yard whose evidence had all but placed the rope around Ben Shaw 's throat , turned away and quietly left the courtroom . He did not enjoy sending any man to his death . Even this one , whose crimes had shocked London . At such a time he was alwaysmindful of his father , a solicitor , who had held strong views on the subject of hanging . " I do n't believe in it . Still , the dead had no choice in their dying , did they ? The murderer did . It 's on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the start what justice would be meted out to him . But he always expects to avoid it , does n't he ? There 's an arrogance in that which disturbs me more than anything else --  " Ben Shaw had n't been arrogant . Murder had n't set well on his conscience . Hanging might come as a relief , an end to nightmares . Who could say ? Certainly not Rutledge himself -- he had never taken a life . Would that alter his view of murder , would it in any way change his ability to understand a crime , or his attitude toward the killer ? He thought not . It was the victim who had always called out to him , the voiceless dead , so often forgotten in the tumultuous courtroom battle of guilt versus innocence . It was said that Justice prevented Anarchy . Law established Order . Cold comfort to the elderly women Ben Shaw had strangled in their beds . Still , the silenced victims had not gone unheard in this courtroom . . . . 5 NOVEMBER , 1919 MARLING , KENT The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen gardens and enough twigs and dead boughs to outlast the Guy . The celebrants were gathered about the square , talking and laughing as if the gruesome spectacle they were about to witness was far more exciting than frightening . The match had yet to be tossed into the pyre , but two men in flowing wigs and faded satin coats awaited the signal . Their sober faces were flushed with wine and duty . The taller leaned toward his companion and said in a low voice , " All this hair itches like the very devil ! " " Yes , well , at least your shirt fits ! This lace will end up strangling me , wait and see ! I 'm ready to kill whoever thought up this charade . " " Wo n't be long now . " It was the close of Guy Fawkes Day , and tonight the stuffed effigy of a traitor was about to be paraded around the village square and then thrown into the flames . Bonfires were a long-standing English tradition , marking the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blow up the Houses of Parliament and King James with them . A macabre way of reminding schoolchildren , as they went round their villages and towns collecting pennies to buy Roman candles , what becomes of traitors . As a rule it was a family affair , held in the back garden , the fire as fat or sparse as the family could manage , the Guy dressed in cast-off clothes stuffed with straw . In too many households during four and a half years of war the celebration had dwindled to a token affair ; the dearth of able-bodied men and the hardships of families struggling to survive without them made the effort increasingly a burden . The village of Marling had decided to revive the custom with a public flourish . Ian Rutledge had given his share of pennies to the local children this morning , while Hamish , in his head , disparaged the whole affair . " It 's no ' a Scottish tradition , to waste guid firewood . It 's too hard to come by . " Remembering the barren , stone-scarred mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When in Rome . . . " " If ye came for Hogmanay , now , a good fire on the hearth was hospitality after a long ride in the cold . " Rutledge knew the Scottish holiday , the last day of the year , when the children demanded gift cakes and the whisky flowed freely -- and not necessarily whisky upon which any tax had been paid . He had commanded Scottish troops in the war , and they had brought their traditions as well as their traditional courage with them . He had turned a blind eye on more than one occasion , the policeman subverted by the compassion he felt for his homesick men -- many little more than boys -- trying to forget how short their lives were destined to be by remembering home . Tonight , 5 November , he was n't on duty in London ; he was standing among the revelers in an attractive village high on the Downs , and beside him was the widow of a friend who had died in the Great War . She had invited him to come down for the occasion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a world of good . It 's time to put the war behind us , and try to rebuild our lives . . . . " He had no life to rebuild , but she did , and Frances , his sister , had urged him to accept the invitation . " Elizabeth has mourned for two years . It wo n't bring Richard back , will it ? I think we should encourage her , if she 's ready to shut the door on all that . And it will do you good as well , to see more of old friends . You 've buried yourself in your work for months now ! " The last accusing . And then Frances had added , hastily , " No , I 'm not matchmaking . She would do as much for either of us , if we were in need , and you know that as well as I do . " It was true . Elizabeth was one of the most generous people Rutledge knew . Richard Mayhew had been very fortunate in his choice of wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sparkling dark eyes and a wry sense of humor . Her presence was brightness and warmth and a belief that life could be good . It was -- almost -- contagious . And just now , he was in need of warmth and brightness , to chase away other shadows . . . . Clinging to his arm in the press of people , Elizabeth was saying , " Richard loved all this , you know . He loved tradition and the . . . " Rutledge lost the thread of her words as the Guy , flamboyant in dress and hanging from a long pole , was brought into the square and carried triumphantly around the unlit fire . A deafening shout of approval rose , and as Rutledge glimpsed the painted mockery of a face , its wild eyes and flaring nostrils , the grinning mouth , the bits of someone 's wig straggling about the ears , he had to laugh . What was lost in talent had been made up in exuberance . " Aye , exuberance , " Hamish agreed , " with a wee touch of Auld Clootie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with generations of Covenanters in his family tree would make such a comparison . Rutledge responded silently , " The first James was your king as well as ours . Or have you forgotten ? " Hamish , considering the matter , replied , " We didna ' care o'ermuch for him . " The Guy was closer now , dancing a jig on the pole , and Elizabeth was laughing like a girl . " Oh , Ian , look , he 's wearing those masquerade clothes I found in the attics and donated to the committee . Would n't Richard have been delighted --  " On the far side of the crowd , someone had lit the fire , and the flames began to fly through the dry brush , reaching for the harder wood . Applause greeted them . In the garish light , the Guy took on a realistic life of its own , the straw-stuffed limbs jerking in time with the booted feet of its minders as it was paraded before an appreciative audience . Shouts of approval and the word " Traitor ! " mingled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " God Save King James and Parliament . " The shrill , giggling voices of children taunted the Guy , a counterpoint to parents warning their offspring not to venture too close to the fire : " Mind now ! " or " Stand clear , do ! " And in the light of the flames , lit just as garishly as the Guy , was a face that Rutledge 's gaze passed over -- and returned to -- and recognized -- But from where ? He went cold with a sense of shock he could n't explain . A knowledge that was there , buried deep in the brain , concealed by layers of denial and blank horror . And yet rising to the surface with the full force of his being was a single realization -- He did n't want to know the answer -- There was danger in searching for the answer -- He stood motionless , his body rigid , his arm stiffening in Elizabeth 's grip . But she was entranced by the spectacle , and unaware . He was physically caught up in his surroundings , the voices of people on every side of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it his way , the warmth of Elizabeth 's hands on him , the coolness of the night air , the rough feel of the wool coat across his shoulders , the shadowed brick facades looming above him -- and at the same time , emotionally , he was firmly locked in a private hell that mirrored the flames rising into the black sky above . As the seconds passed , it seemed for a fraction of an instant that the eyes of his enemy sought and found his before moving on . The odd light lent them a ferocity that stunned him . As if acknowledging a connection between them , a connection built on -- what ? And how did he know this was an enemy ? " Gentle God , " Rutledge whispered under his breath -- and then the face vanished , a will-o ' - the- wisp in the November night , a figment of murky imagination lost in the smoke . Suddenly he doubted his own senses . He had seen it -- Dear God , surely he had seen it ! Or -- had it been no more than a fleeting memory from the last days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something best buried in the dim reaches of his mind , best unresurrected ? In this past week uneasy memories had surfaced and disappeared with disconcerting irregularity , as if the approaching anniversary of the Armistice had jarred them into life again . Rutledge was not the only soldier who was experiencing this phenomenon -- he 'd heard two constables who had survived the trenches warily questioning each other about lapses in concentration . And several men in a pub dancing uneasily around who was sleeping well and who was n't . There had been the officer sitting on a bench by the Embankment , staring at the river water with such obsessive fascination that Rutledge had stopped and spoken to him . The man had traveled a long way back to the present , and looked up at Rutledge as though wanting to ask , " Were you there ? " And saying instead , " The water 's bitter cold and gray today , is n't it ? " It was almost a confession that drowning had been on his mind . As if uncertain , all of them , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover they were not alone in their fears . As if that made it more tolerable , not being alone . . . . Just this need had sent him down to Kent . He found himself searching among the villagers gathered in a ring around the fire 's blazing gold and red light , but the face he sought was no longer there . Not now . Not ever ? Hamish , alarmed and accusing in the back of his mind , was exclaiming , " It canna ' be . Ye 've gone o'wer the edge , man ! " Badly shaken , Rutledge had lost sight of the perambulating Guy , making a lap on the far side of the bonfire . Now the grotesque effigy was coming round once more , a final circuit while the lengths of harder wood smoked and began to burn hot enough to consume the fire 's prey . Over by the bronze statue of a mounted cavalier that stood at the point of the square where the main road curved away from the High Street , there was hilarity as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . The bronze cavalier 's back was turned on the antics of his descendants , his face haughty and withdrawn under the brim of his plumed hat , the aristocratic arch of his nose and the smooth sweep of his cheekbones highlighted by the fire 's blaze . As the first Roman candles went streaming noisily skyward from the cluster of children , Rutledge flinched . At the Front , flares had been used to test the wind -- The crack ! and the rat-a-tat-tat of the smaller charges sent his heart rate soaring . He felt exposed , caught out in the open , as the sounds of war surrounded him again . His immediate inclination was to shout orders to his men , to bend into the run that would carry him across No Man 's Land -- Elizabeth , suddenly aware , looked up at the tension in his face and cried , " Oh -- I did n't think -- are you all right ? It 's only the children --  " Rutledge nodded , unable to trust his voice . Just then the Guy went sailing into the heart of the blaze , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him . The onlookers were ecstatic , roaring at the top of their lungs as the straw-stuffed figure jerked and twisted as if in torment . The candles streamed wildly above the tongues of flame , and the noise was deafening . Rutledge was still scouring the faces illuminated by the flames . A policeman was trained to observe , to remember the shape of a nose , the width of a mouth , the way the eyes were set and the height of the forehead .
