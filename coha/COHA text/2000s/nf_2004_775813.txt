Prologue The Defining Moment // To Woodrow Wilson , it seemed the cheering would never end . The president had sailed to Europe three weeks after the Armistice that had halted the savage killing of the First World War . Now his task was to complete a peace treaty that would bring forth a League of Nations that he believed would prevent a great war from ever happening again . // As the steamship George Washington reached the French seacoast of Brittany just before dawn on December 13 , 1918 , Wilson could see lights on the horizon as a flotilla of American warships sailed out to greet him . Nine battleships came abreast of the warship and the five destroyers that had accompanied the George Washington across the Atlantic . Each fired a twenty-one-gun salute to the president of the United States as Wilson 's ship sailed toward the harbor at Brest. // There was more to come . Two French cruisers and nine French destroyers came up from the south , firing their own salutes . By the time Wilson entered the harbor , shore batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began firing salutes . The military bands on the top of the cliffs blazed forth with renditions of " The Star-Spangled Banner " and " La Marseillaise. " // Once the president and his wife were onshore , the mayor of Brest offered Wilson a parchment scroll , festooned with red , white , and blue ribbons , which contained the greetings of the city council . The Americans then climbed into open automobiles that took them up the cliff and on to the railroad station where French President Raymond Poincar ? was waiting to escort them to Paris . // Along the route American soldiers were standing at attention . As the train approached the French capital people swarmed the tracks waiting to welcome the American president . The next day , the largest number of Parisians ever to welcome a foreign leader packed the streets and boulevards . Under a clear autumn sky , from the church of the Madeleine to the Bois de Boulogne , they thronged the sidewalks and rooftops . Thirty-six thousand French soldiers formed lines to hold back the crowds . // Flowers floated down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched across the Champs- ? lys ? es that proclaimed " Honor to Wilson the Just . " For the first time in living memory , a carriage passed under the Arc de Triomphe . " No one ever had such cheers , " the American journalist William Bolitho wrote , " I , who heard them in the streets of Paris , can never forget them in my life . I saw Marshall Foch pass , Premier Clemenceau pass , British Prime Minister Lloyd George , generals , returning troops , banners , but Wilson heard from this carriage something different , inhuman - or superhuman . Oh , the immovably shining , smiling man ! " // For the rest of the month of December , similar scenes were repeated in England , including a trip north to Carlisle near the Scottish border where Wilson 's mother was born and his grandfather had been a preacher before immigrating to America . Then back to Paris and on December 31 by the Italian royal train to Rome , where he was met with near hysterical demonstrations . Airplanes roared overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with golden sand from the Mediterranean , an ancient tradition of honoring heroes come to Rome . Leaving the capital to journey north to Turin and Milan , he blew kisses to the crowd . // Wilson thought he was on the verge of realizing his dream of bringing perpetual peace to a worn-out continent , a Europe whose statesmen believed that maintaining a balance of power among nations was the only way to contain conflict . // Only two months earlier , Wilson had suffered a serious setback . In November 1918 , his Democratic Party lost both the House and the Senate to the Republicans . Now the opposition asked what right did he have to go to Europe as a representative of the American people . His greatest antagonist , former president Theodore Roosevelt , had declared : " Our allies and our enemies and Mr. Wilson himself should all understand that Mr. Wilson has no authority whatever to speak for the American people at this time . His leadership has been emphatically repudiated by them ... and all his utterances every which way have ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the will of the American people . " // It was Roosevelt who had split the Republican Party by running against President William Howard Taft in the presidential election of 1912 , and by so doing may well have handed Wilson the presidency . Now Roosevelt , having repaired his relations with the Republicans , was , at sixty , their likely candidate for president in 1920 . During the campaign , Wilson had written that Roosevelt appealed to people 's imagination ; by contrast , " I do not . He is a real , vivid person ... I am a vague , conjectural personality , more made up of opinions and academic prepossessions than of human traits and red corpuscles. " // Of the other two men who had run in the 1912 campaign against Wilson , William Howard Taft was now happily teaching at the Yale Law School , relieved that he had not been re-elected president ; by running a second time for an office he had never truly enjoyed , he had achieved his goal of preventing Roosevelt , once his closest friend , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate , Eugene V. Debs , he was still fervently committed to an ideology Wilson both feared and despised . Debs had opposed Wilson 's war . Now he was awaiting the verdict of the United States Supreme Court on his appeal to overturn a conviction for violating the Espionage and Sedition Acts . // As the royal train bore him through the Italian Alps toward France , Wilson and his wife sat alone in the royal coach . He was in high spirits , for those who had opposed him were far away and he was being hailed as the savior of Europe . About nine in the evening , January 6 , 1919 , the train stopped at Modena for a short time . Wilson remained in his seat while newspaper correspondents strolled along the platform to stretch their legs . They could easily see him through the window as a messenger brought him a telegram . // When he first glanced at the piece of paper , Wilson was clearly surprised at what he was reading . One of the correspondents saw what he thought was a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph . A few moments later , the newspaperman learned that the telegram had informed the president that Theodore Roosevelt was dead . // TR 's funeral took place in early January . He had been very sick since the day the Armistice was signed on November 11 , 1918 , in and out of hospitals , and finally home to Sagamore Hill for Christmas Eve . It was difficult for him to walk , racked as he was with what the doctors believed was inflammatory rheumatism , and doubtless complicated by parasites he may have picked up on his trip to explore the River of Doubt in the Brazilian jungles five years earlier . Dying in his sleep at four in the morning on January 6 , of an embolism , Roosevelt was to be buried at Youngs ' Cemetery at Oyster Bay , Long Island , a site not far from Sagamore Hill . The service 's only ceremony was the Episcopal Church 's Burial of the Dead . // It was snowing that morning . The airplanes that had been flying for the past two days in tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilot who had died over France during the World War , could no longer keep up their vigil . Roosevelt 's wife , Edith , stayed in the house , as was then customary , and read through the funeral service , while some five hundred villagers and dignitaries attended the service at Christ Church . // William Howard Taft , when he heard of Roosevelt 's death , telegrammed Mrs. Roosevelt , saying that the world had lost " the most commanding personality in our public life since Lincoln . " By now , Taft and Roosevelt had been reconciled . Later , he wrote to TR 's sister Corinne to say how glad he was " that Theodore and I came together after that long painful interval . Had he died in a hostile state of mind toward me , I would have mourned the fact all my life . I loved him always and cherish his memory . " // Arriving at Oyster Bay , Taft found that the arrangements for receiving him at the funeral services had been botched . He was at first put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son Archie saw what had happened , he came up and said , " You 're a dear personal friend and you must come up farther . " He seated Taft just behind Vice President Thomas Marshall , who was there representing Woodrow Wilson , and just in front of the Senate committee headed by TR 's closest political ally and Wilson 's great enemy , Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts . // As the coffin was borne out of the church , the snow had stopped falling , although the sky was still gray and heavy . Taft and the other mourners made their way to the cemetery , which was about a mile and a half from the church , and then climbed the hill to where the open grave was waiting . The simple burial service came to an end . Others moved away from the graveside . Taft , however , remained longer than anyone , weeping . // Eugene V. Debs , the Socialist candidate for the presidency in 1912 , was waiting in early 1919 to be spirited off to prison . Debs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American socialism , seemed to welcome the prospect of going to jail for his beliefs . // America at that time was in the grip of a Red Scare that Wilson 's Attorney General , A. Mitchell Palmer , had inflicted on those whom the government suspected of Bolshevik sympathies and/or being too critical of the war effort . Wilson ordered Palmer " not to let this country see Red , " and in the opening months of 1918 , more than two thousand radical unionists were arrested , and two hundred convictions had been secured under the new espionage law . // In defending himself in his address to the jury in September 1918 , Debs invoked the memory of George Washington , Tom Paine , and John Adams , " the rebels of their day , " and recalled the memory of America 's abolitionists . In contesting the specific charges against him , Debs not only defended his right to free speech under the Constitution but also bitterly cited Wilson 's 1912 campaign speeches supporting that right . // All was in vain . The jury found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentencing , Debs rose and made a statement to the court . His words have remained as the clearest declaration of his humanist principles . After recognizing his " kinship with all living beings , " he famously said , " while there is a lower class , I am in it , while there is a criminal element , I am of it , and where there is a soul in prison , I am not free . " // The judge sentenced Debs to ten years ' imprisonment . // The year 1912 constitutes a defining moment in American history . Of the four men who sought the presidency that year - Wilson , Roosevelt , Taft , and Debs - not one of them had definitively decided to run after the congressional elections of 1910. // Wilson , who had just been elected governor of New Jersey , had long hoped that someday the White House would be his , but all his experience had been as a college professor , and later a president of Princeton . He had been a noted theorist of congressional government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president on the Socialist ticket twice before . His firm commitment to social and economic justice targeted him once again as the favorite of Socialist voters , but he himself was weary of campaigning , often too sick to do anything but speak . His thrilling oratory , however , made him invaluable in the struggle against the excesses of industrial capitalism . // Taft , the reluctant incumbent , might well have abandoned the field of battle in 1912 and taught happily at Yale Law School while hoping for an appointment to the Supreme Court . Roosevelt , though lusting after the power of the presidency , still expected to support Taft . TR , after all , had shown himself to be a consummate politician during his two terms in office and appreciated the potency of the party organization . If Taft could have approached his former mentor directly , confessed his anxieties about dealing with a Congress so dominated by right-wing Republicans that he was finding it impossible to fulfill the reformist policies of TR , he might then have urged Roosevelt to run for a third term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidency that Taft had so often loathed. // Had the charismatic Roosevelt received the Republican nomination , he almost surely would have won . He , far more than Taft , was in tune with the progressive spirit of the time . The Republican Party , in his hands , would likely have become a party of domestic reform and internationalist realism in foreign affairs . With his heroic virtues and condemnation of materialism , Roosevelt represents the road not taken by American conservatism . // The vote polled in 1912 by Debs , who garnered the largest share of the popular total ever won by a Socialist candidate , revealed the depth of the reformist forces sweeping the land . Never again would the Socialists show such strength . The Democrats during Wilson 's first term quickly picked up many of the social remedies Debs - and a radicalized Roosevelt - had championed . // Like Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson embraced change , both men recognizing that their own careers could not flourish if they were to hold back the tide of reform . Neither leader believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues at stake were vital if America was to transform itself into a society that would deal effectively with the problems of the new century without sacrificing the democratic values that the Founders had envisaged . With the recent influx of new immigrants , many of them were condemned to work in squalid sweatshops and live in the deteriorating conditions of the urban poor . Journalists , social workers , ministers , and middle-class Americans were outraged at the widespread corruption of political bossism in the nation 's cities . // The threats to the environment by the expansion of industry and population seemed to require a national commitment to conserving the nation 's natural resources to avoid further destruction of wildlife and grasslands . The issue of woman suffrage , the safeguarding of the right of black Americans to vote , and the need to end child labor and to regulate factory hours and conditions went to the very heart of the promise of American democracy . // Above all , there was the question of how to curb the excesses of big business , symbolized by the great trusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Roosevelt , calling for a " New Nationalism , " the role of government was to regulate big business , which was surely here to stay . For Wilson 's " New Freedom , " the government 's task was to restore competition in a world dominated by technology and mass markets that crushed small business . //
