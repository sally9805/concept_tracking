Section : Companies , People , Ideas Upstarts Some people want to use the Internet to turn the music labels on their heads . The smart ones just want to teach them a lesson . <p> DAVID GOLDBERG CONSIDERED himself lucky when , as a 24-year-old music fanatic , he landed a job as director of new business development at Capitol Records . <p> Barely three years later , the thrill was gone . Though Capitol , part of the $5 billion EMI Group , was paying him more than $100,000 a year , it was n't listening to him . Executives cared little for his ideas to exploit the label 's vast library , which includes the Beatles and Frank Sinatra . In his waning days at Capitol in 1993 , he wanted to do new-media promotions , such as music on CD-ROM games . His bosses told him to get lost . And , he came to realize , " there are record companies that are a lot worse . " <p> Cut to fall 1999 : Alanis Morissette , rock 's top selling female rocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web marketing , the kind of innovation that the Capitols of the world once resisted . And she 's doing it in conjunction with her record label , the Warner-affiliated Maverick Records . <p> Goaded by entrepreneurs like Goldberg , the $40 billion music industry is finally waking up to new media . After leaving Capitol , Goldberg created Launch Media , which now runs one of the top five music information sites ( launch.com ) on the Internet . <p> Launch counts NBC and Sony Music as two of its largest shareholders , and it vies for advertising with rivals for young eyeballs like Saturday Night Live and Rolling Stone . Goldberg , at Capitol a punching bag for prickly artist managers and their angry clients , now is a man to see , even though his company will be lucky to hit $17 million in revenue this year . When Beck 's manager recently called to apologize for the singer 's delayed interview appearance , Goldberg shrugged ; he was preparing to greet Hollywood babe Denise Richards . When Launch went public in April , his stake was worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the litter . Others are further along in taking a surprisingly hidebound industry where it resisted going . Counter to Wall Street wisdom ( see box , p. 80 ) , the " where " is not a revolutionary abandonment of corporate-produced CDs for independent Web downloads . Rather , it 's a realm of interactivity among consumers , performers and labels that breaks down fiefdoms while promising to enhance the business of selling recorded music . <p> Marc Geiger and Don Muller , two former booking agents , grew tired of watching their industry drag its heels into cyberspace . So in 1996 they formed Artistdirect , a portal of general information and band-specific sites that sells T shirts and other merchandise alongside free information like song lyrics and sheet music . Collectively , the sites are among the largest music-information draws on the Web . <p> When the company goes public later this year , with just $3.7 million in half-year revenues , the pair 's cut will likely be worth more than $100 million . Another partner , producer Rick Rubin , could end up with $75 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hippie rockers like the Grateful Dead , Santana and Jefferson Starship , has a $36 million piece of an Internet music distributor called Liquid Audio . The company provides labels and bands a system to deliver secure music files over data lines . It had a grand total of $1.4 million in first-half revenues . Robert Kohn , a onetime industry attorney , and techie Gene Hoffman Jr . together have stakes in an on-line music promotion and music download site called EMusic.com worth $90 million . Revenues : $92,000 . " The Internet was just not in the labels ' DNA , " says Kohn . <p> These companies are gnats in an industry dominated by giants like Universal Music Group , Warner Music Group , Sony Music , BMG Entertainment and EMI , most with burgeoning Internet operations of their own . Still , the equity market likes the upstarts . <p> The music business has been a lot like the movie business . A few big producers own the artists ( by dint of long-term contracts ) and rule over the distribution system ( with their huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , tapes or CDs and ship them to stores , which they pay for prominent display . <p> The new operators cut through such arrangements . Kearby , 52 , says that when he tried lining up record companies to sell through Liquid Audio , one record executive vowed to squash the budding venture because it threatened the business . " He was n't alone . The industry was like an ostrich with its head stuck in the sand . " <p> That is beginning to change , as labels see possibilities  --  or necessities . Witness Human Clay by the rock band Creed , a small-label release promoted to the top of the charts via the Internet . Next month Liquid Audio will use its network of 300 on-line and kiosk retailers to sell a new Morissette song . It is doing the same for the Dave Matthews Band , an act with BMG . " Not one of these artists will walk away from their traditional record partners , " says rock manager Jim Guerinot . <p> Why not ? Because recording companies still offer the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music into the hands of consumers . The difference , thanks to the new breed of marketers , is that now , if Web downloads become a popular channel , bands can get greater merchandise sales , potential ad revenue from their sites and , if they have leverage , a bigger cut of music sales . <p> Of course the old giants wo n't adjust readily . Some labels are now seeking to control domain names of the bands on their rosters , which , of course , does n't sit too well with the artists . When manager Cliff Burnstein recently brought Sony a new act called Crazy Town , he did so with the domain name crazytown.com already registered . Sony tried blocking the band from printing the name on the album cover . So the group hastily recorded a song called " www.crazytown.com . " Under their contract provisions , Sony could not stop the move . The so .. FT. - Of appear as the final cut on the album . <p> Perhaps the next time around Sony wo n't try to put the kibosh on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to experiment in a way the labels wo n't , " says Marc Schiller , president of Electric Artists , an on-line consultancy for bands and labels . " Our role is to teach the industry to do things differently . " By the Numbers <p> DIGITAL JUKEBOX The volume is increading on the Web 's leading music information sites . Investors are betting profits will follow .
