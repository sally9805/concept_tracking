HIDING IN THE SHADOWS OF OTHER TALL RANGES , THE PIONEER MOUNTAINS ARE A SPECTACULAR HAVEN FROM THE MASSES . // " THIS CA N'T BE OUR TRAIL , " murmurs Penny . Ten minutes earlier , we 'd crossed 9,300-foot PK Pass , cresting a long ridge of 10,000-foot peaks in Idaho 's Pioneer Mountains . Now we should be descending along Iron Mine Creek . Instead , our trail has swung away from the creek , heading for the wrong part of our map . So we double back and discover the trail junction we 'd overlooked , hidden by low sagebrush . The faint crossing is n't on the map . No sign marks it . The footpath spans maybe 10 inches , hardly resembling the wide backpacker boulevards you see in popular mountains . I make a mental note : Narrow , less-than-obvious trails , unmarked junctions not shown on the map . These conditions would frustrate some folks , but they look mighty good to us . Good because Penny and I have come to the Pioneers for some peace , quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two friends . Straddling the Sawtooth and Challis National Forests , the Pioneers rank second in height among Idaho ranges , with one summit , Hyndman Peak , topping 12,000 feet . In his guidebook , Idaho-A Climbing Guide , author Tom Lopez writes : " By almost any measure , the Pioneer Mountains are Idaho 's premier mountain range . The scenic vistas are terrific . " But living in the shadow of more famous ranges-the Sawtooths and the Boulder-White Clouds to the north and the Lost River Range to the east-the Pioneers are largely overlooked . Study a map of the Pioneers and you 'll see a jumble of contour lines resembling one of those puzzles where you have to find the 10 hidden frogs . It 's a dry range of serrated ridges and rocky peaks floating above forests of fir and pine . Aspen dot the higher , more shaded slopes ; south-facing shoulders wear woolly sweaters of sage and other high-desert flora . The map bears little type , with many unnamed tarps and 10,000- to 11,000-foot peaks . After a clear night spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Box Canyon , flanked by tall cliffs and patchwork groves of conifers . A creek bloated by snowmelt leaps over waterfalls and slides thinly over smooth slabs . Where a washout has obliterated the trail , we mistakenly pick up a use path to Lower Box Canyon Lake . Realizing our error , we consult the map and strike off crosscountry to intersect the main trail-and chance upon a sodroofed , one-room log cabin . We poke our heads inside its dark interior , where the uneven dirt floor is buckled from decades of freezing and thawing . Our eyes pick through the dim light , finding old teapots , a metal bed frame , a tattered pair of britches hanging from a nail . In more popular mountains , this treasure would have been picked clean long ago . Instead , the cabin sits as if its owner had just stepped out to chop some firewood . We imagine the solitude he must have known , guessing that he , too , enjoyed having this canyon and these mountains to himself . At Upper Box Canyon Lake , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch camp . I find a small patch of shaded snow and make a foot-tall snowman for Nate ; he grins and pokes at it with a cautious finger . Standing in a meadow , we inspect the wall of cliffs a quartermile away . Somewhere along that imposing ridgeline lies Johnstone Pass . We notice a zigzagging footpath that climbs up the wall before dissolving into a washout . That ca n't be our trail , we all say-and as soon as I hear the words , I smile . After long minutes of doubtful surveying , we decide the pass must be that hatchet-chopped notch in the cliffs . And , yes , the zigzagging path must be our trail . Tomorrow morning , we 'll claw our way up its steep , loose dirt and descend gingerly down the other side , finishing our trip by midday and having seen no one until passing three dayhikers near the trailhead . Gazing up at Johnstone Pass , I feel my face breaking into a broad smile . That faint track barely qualifies as a trail , but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?
