When John Morressy died last March , we were fortunate to have a few stories by him in inventory . " Fool , " sadly , is the last of them ( though we 're still hoping some gems will turn up in his papers ) . It 's a poignant and potent fantasy narrated by one of our favorite characters to pass through these pages recently . By the way , readers should know we have a fine appreciation of John Morressy 's work on our Website . Dave Truesdale has begun writing " Off on a Tangent " for us every month . Check it out on the " Departments " page ; the December column takes a long look at the Morressy legacy . <p> " NICCOLO COMES ! " At the cry , revelers crammed with food and sodden with wine cease their gobbling and swilling . They forget their eager lusts and roar with delight when I hobble in , darting in sudden lunges from side to side , wheeling round and round to afford every guest a look at my form and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the climax of every feast . Mixed with the shrieks of laughter are cries of horror and disgust . A sensitive few shrink from the sight of me and avert their eyes . I have caused women to faint ; and some men , as well , to the delight of their companions . Such is my welcome , and I glory in it . I was bom to be a fool , and I am a master of my calling . And I am something more . Oh , yes , I am much more . Had I been a shade less hideous , just a trifle less misshapen and illmade , the midwife would have seen to it that I did not survive to shame my family . But I was plucked from the womb so magnificently ugly , so repellent to the eye , that she held me up by my crooked legs and cried , " Here 's gold ! " That old woman was wise in the world 's ways . She knew that there were many who would pay well for a fool who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suit me for the motley , no fortunate accident or contorting sickness . I was born fully malformed . I offended not merely the eye , but the ear as well . When I gave my first cry , the first of many , all those in hearing winced and shuddered , covered their ears , and declared that the devil himself had stuck his snout into our hovel to announce my birth . And perhaps he had . Perhaps he had . My parents did not accept the midwife 's estimate of my value . Whether they were too impatient , too needy , or simply eager to be free of the sight of me , I can not say . Whatever the reason , they sold me while I was still a child , not for gold or even silver but for copper , and very little of that . I never saw my family again , to their great relief , I am sure . Certainly to mine . My value has increased considerably since that day . I have refined my natural gifts and mastered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my work , and my work is varied . I am not always paid to amuse . I remember little of my early years except the beatings . They were administered as guides to conduct and aids to my instruction , and served to me with greater regularity than my meals . My appearance and my clumsiness made me a handy object for the exercise of my first master 's household , where I held a place below the lowliest servant . The beatings ended only when I was sold into the household of a bishop . He was shocked to learn that I had never been baptized , and horrified when I told him the reason . My parents were simple pious folk who believed in a Heaven of eternal beauty and serenity . Such a place , they explained to my former master as they accepted his coins , could hold no room for such a thing as I , and so they never brought me to the baptismal font . Or did they fear that I would taint the water ? I entered the bishop 's palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that good saint 's name . The bishop was a godly man , severe toward himself but kindly to all others , a man too good for this rats " nest of a world men scrabble in . He delivered me from a cruel master and strove to teach me a different way of life . In the bishop 's residence I was not an animal to be beaten into docile obedience , worked to death , and then tossed on a dunghill . To the bishop , my outward form did not matter . I was not a possession but the good man 's brother in Christ , a child of God with a soul to be saved . I believe he actually saw a kind of beauty in me -a feat achieved by only one person since that time , and that person mad . I have never attempted it myself . In the bishop 's palace I learned that " God " was a word to be spoken in reverence , not in rage . I learned to read and write , and how to conduct myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far more desirable place to live than the barnyard , and I strove to be a model pupil . The good bishop also taught me the tenets of the faith and instructed me in morals . In those areas , though I was careful to give the required responses and display the expected piety in his presence , my progress was somewhat limited . All in all , the bishop did his best to prepare me for the next world . Unknown to him , I was learning of the attractions of this one , and I was unwilling to depart from it without enjoying a goodly share of them . In his palace , besides the scholars and the devout , the bishop had men and women with a wide range of worldly experience . He had in his employ some who had been thieves , prostitutes , and murderers . He was aware of their past transgressions , but believed them to be committed to a new life of repentance and atonement . In this he was deceived . The bishop looked at men and women and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were . The thieves , prostitutes , and murderers , too , became my teachers , and prepared me well for life this side of the grave . They taught me that we have always time to repent , should we be so inclined , but our time for pleasure and profit is short . We must make the most of our talents , and if opportunities do not come to us , we must create them . It was from a chance remark of one of the thieves that I first learned of a chamber deep below the palace , a lead-lined vault locked and sealed and barricaded behind a wall of nibble . To it there existed only one key , and that key remained always in the bishop 's possession . When I pressed the thief , he would say no more . I knew him to be a man of great daring , yet when I questioned him about the chamber he grew hesitant and evasive . He assured me that it was no more than an idle tale and urged me to dismiss it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in the household had ever made reference to this chamber . Only from an old servant , and at the cost of many tedious hours , did I draw out an account of the chamber and its contents . Since long before the bishop 's time , the vault had been a repository for books of an abominable nature , books so steeped in evil that they were beyond the power of man to destroy . To bury them in the ground would blight the earth , - to drown them in the sea would poison the waters , the smoke of their burning would kill every living thing . All this the old servant told me , in fearful whispers . I thought it wise to profess disbelief , and even to scoff at his tale . Inwardly I became obsessed by the thought of such power resting under my feet in this very palace . I had to possess it . Thanks to the bishop 's tutelage I had become as skilled a reader as any clerk . Now I had a purpose for that skill . Desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my hands and glean their wisdom , overmastered me . I revealed my intention to no one . I knew the value of stealth and patience , and my purpose demanded both in great measure . I knew the palace cellars well , and after much diligent searching I located the chamber . To the unsuspecting eye it was no more than a pile of rubble heaped against a wall , but when I dug , I unearthed a locked iron door , icy to my touch . The chamber was real . Still I was forced to bide my time . I replaced the concealing nibble and waited . I observed the bishop closely , and eventually I learned where he concealed the key . One night when all the rest slept I entered the vault . A dead and penetrating cold enveloped me the moment I entered , and a surge of fear nearly overcame me . But I could not turn back , not when those forbidden volumes lay within my reach . My hand trembled as I raised my lantern and scanned the shelves of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power beyond imagining . I saw books and scrolls of widely varied shapes and sizes . They numbered something more than a hundred . No two were alike . Some of the books were bound in plates of gold embedded with precious stones , others had simple leather covers free of all adornment . Some , I believe , were bound in human flesh . The scrolls too varied in size , from slim as a finger and scarcely longer to the length and thickness of a man 's arm . All these observations I made in great haste . I knew that I must act quickly . Time was limited and my courage was all but gone . I might never have the opportunity of a second visit , even if I dared it . The room grew ever colder , and my fear increased as the cold gripped my spirit . I had only the strength and will to snatch a few volumes and conceal them in some safe place where I might return to study them at leisure . But many were too heavy to lift ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not read . A few shrank from my touch like live things . Terror possessed me completely . I seized a single scroll and fled in panic from the chamber . I have never again known such fear as I felt that night . In a cold sweat , trembling , my heart racing , I cowered in a far alcove until I had recovered . And then a change came over me . As if burned out of me by the cold , all fear vanished forever . Never again would I fear anything on this Earth . I still could sense the fear in others , but I did not share it . Emboldened , I returned to reseal the room and replace the stones that concealed the entrance . When all signs of my visit had been removed , I returned to my chamber and collapsed in utter exhaustion . When I read the scroll , I found that I had chosen well . It contained a malediction that I might invoke three times to destroy my enemies . Had I remained in the bishop 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , but like so many good men , the bishop died in the prime of life , his health broken by years of sacrifice and self-denial . The new bishop was a very different man . He found many of the household unsuitable , myself among them . When I left the palace , the scroll remained behind . Its contents had long been fixed in my memory . Whether it has yet begun to corrupt the soil around its place of concealment , I neither know nor care . I had learned enough . The old bishop admonished me repeatedly to speak only good of the dead . He also urged me to speak the truth . I am therefore in a dilemma about how to refer to my next master , a wealthy merchant . His home was a treasure vault and a prison . He was false to God and men , cruel without cause , and now he is dead . His death was mysterious and to those who were present , terrifying . It was the first test of my knowledge from the vault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could now be used but twice more but a reassuring proof of its efficacy . It was the master 's habit to lock the door of his sleeping chamber against thieves and enemies . His bodyguard , a giant mute named Orso who could kill a man with one blow , always slept before the door . On the night of the master 's death , all in the household were awakened by his shrill cries and the sound of a violent struggle . Another voice could be heard within the room , and while none could agree on the language it spoke , all agreed on the terror it inspired in them . The door could not be opened , and resisted all Orso 's efforts to break it down . Yet at dawn it swung wide , and those who entered saw a sight that sickened them . The master 's blood spattered walls and floor , and his body lay torn and rent as if by the claws of a great beast . Little remained of his face but the eyes , which were fixed in a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I knew the power of the malediction . Two uses remained , and I resolved to use them prudently . I recount what I was told , for I was not present at the master 's death . I had planned carefully . It occurred on a night when two other servants and I were away on an errand of some importance . My role in his death was never suspected . The master 's sudden passing caused great disorder in the household . Another servant and I took the opportunity to fill our pockets and set out on our own . MY EDUCATION now took a different turn . I already knew how difficult the world is for one whom others consider fair game for their sport . I had acquired a powerful defense , but could not employ it lightly . Now I learned simpler ways that a man , though misshapen and lacking a protector , can be a match for the strong . My companion Giulio and I lived for a time on our late master 's ducats and when they were gone , by theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hanged , but the unfortunate lad had a hot temper . He died in a foolish brawl . With him fell two others , one of them a member of a troupe of traveling players . I saw an opportunity . The very next day I joined their company . The bishop had instructed me in rhetoric and logic , and trained my memory . I was skilled in dispute and ready in repartee . From fellow servants I had learned to juggle and become something of an acrobat . My talents improved with practice , and with my addition , the company prospered . My lot improved . I had no need to call upon my darker power . I knew how to use a weapon and had companions who would come to my aid . I had money in my purse , and could purchase meat and drink and the companionship of women who treated me , for a time , as a man like all others . But the world held more , and I meant to have my full share . One night , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege of drinking poor wine and eating worse food , a man in elegant but somber dress entered into conversation with me . I was wary , as one must always be of strangers , especially those who are clearly superior to the surrounding company ; but he was well groomed and well spoken , and spent freely . I anticipated some profit in listening to him . We discussed commonplaces for a time , and since I am aware that people do not speak to me out of kindliness or fellow-feeling , I grew impatient for him to broach the subject that had brought him into my company . At last he asked , " Do you like the life of a traveler ? " " I have little choice , " I replied . " Life in a great household is more comfortable and rewarding . " " I am certain it is . And it is better to be rich than poor . " He smiled and nodded , and when he did not speak , I went on , " What great household would welcome me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and women miscarry . If I tend animals , they pine away . Put me in the kitchen and the milk will sour . Stand me by the fire and it burns blue and stinks of sulphur . I have heard all the jokes others make at my expense , sir , and require none from you . " His placid expression did not change . He lifted his palms in a pacifying gesture . " I do not joke . I offer a possibility . " " Offer it , then . " " You might be a powerful man 's jester . You have the necessary skills . " " You are polite , sir . Whatever I do , I am already a jest to all who see me . " " Commoners and rabble , " he said . " They toss you a few pennies and then curse themselves for spendthrifts . Your skills are wasted on them . A great man 's fool eats good food and sleeps in a soft bed . He wears fine clothes . He has a protector . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And where am I to find this benefactor ? " He smiled a tight , satisfied smile , like one who holds the answer to a child 's riddle . " In the palazzo that lies not half an hour 's walk from this inn , on the grand piazza of the city . My master 's fool was killed in a quarrel among the servants , and he seeks a man to replace him . " " I have no wish to be stabbed by some angry kitchen boy , " I said . " The Count Ridolfo is a just man . He made an example of the murderer . Such an incident will not recur , " said the stranger . " And how will my lot improve ? " " Pour out that ditch water and try this , " he said , pushing before me a leather bottle from which he had been drinking . I emptied my cup on the floor and refilled it with wine from his bottle . It was better than the best from the bishop 's cellar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their food is as good as their drink , " he said . " And they sleep in soft beds under a dry roof . Tell me , do they dress in silks and furs ? " He looked my shabby false finery up and down and said , " Their livery is somewhat more pleasing to the eye than yours , and much cleaner . " " Why do you offer me such good things , sir ? Are you my guardian angel ? My patron saint ? " " Not an angel , still less a saint , " he said , still smiling . " I am the fattoie of Count Ridolfo . My duty is to keep the household running smoothly . We have lost a fool . I saw you perform and decided you would be an admirable replacement . Come to the palazzo in the morning , and say you come at Benedetto 's invitation . " I had learned long ago not to trust anyone . But that night I gave his offer much thought . My occult learning was useful , but dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable . I was weary of traveling , of the bickering of these players , of coaxing coins from peasants who were nearly as ugly as I and as dull as oxen . The life of a powerful man 's fool could be no worse . And thus I came to a new calling . As I walked to the palazzo of Count Ridolfo the following morning I heard no more than the usual taunts of street loafers and young idlers . The sight of my weapons discouraged anything more than catcalls from a safe distance . Benedetto 's name admitted me to the palazzo , and he saw to it that I was quickly installed in the household . By nightfall I had met most of the servants . Only one incident marred my arrival , and I quickly turned it to my advantage . When I was introduced in the servants " quarters a loud red-faced fellow whom I could see at once was the sort who was always eager to put a newcomer in his place looked up from where he sat and said to his fellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? I say we christen him " Malfatto . " What say you ? " When no one objected , he raised his cup and said , " Come , Malfatto , and receive your new name . " I laughed along with the others as I went to his side , my hand extended in friendship . The laughter stopped when I locked my fingers in his and bent back his hand until he slid from his seat to the floor , whimpering for release . I let him plead for a time , and then I leant closer and said softly in his ear , " My name is Niccolo . Tell that to everyone . Say " Malfatto " in my hearing again and it will be your dying word . " I gave him a hard kick in the ribs to impress my words on his memory and then helped him to his feet . He welcomed me by name . The incident had the desired effect on my fellow servants . Unfortunately for my antagonist , he chose to discomfort me in other ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of him , but it was not necessary . He died in a fall from the bell tower . Before my first week 's end I was measured for my livery . Soon I was wearing the finest outfit I had ever possessed , of excellent materials perfectly fitted to the contours of my body . For a full month I busied myself learning the ways of the household before I was admitted to Count Ridolfo 's presence . There had been much coming and going in the palazzo during those days , solemn faces and wary glances among the family , and among the servants much speculation about the cause of this tension . Rumors abounded , but no knowledge . As a newcomer , I was the least informed of all ; and so I waited , made myself agreeable to everyone I met-it is a skill one acquires - and before many days learned the cause of all the stir . Word had come from a trustworthy informant that a rival family planned an attack on the Count and his sons . I could learn no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best for the fool to play the fool until the proper moment . I was summoned to Count Ridolfo 's private chamber late one night . He was with four men , two of whom I recognized as his sons . This was my first sight of my master , and I found him formidable . Count Ridolfo had a large leonine head with a great crown of white hair . His face was square , his mouth narrow , and his jaw prominent . His nose had been broken and inexpertly set , and a thin scar ran down his right cheek . That face , cold and hard as stone , was a silent warning . His displeasure was plain to see . This was a man whom ordinary men might fear , with good reason . He would be very useful to me . He bade me approach , stopping me a few paces away with a gesture . Count Ridolfo permitted no one to get close to him-a precaution he had adopted after a cousin gave him the scar on his cheek . He looked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , like a man studying a work of art . " So you are my fool , " he said . " No , my lord . I am your good angel , " I said , bowing and making my most hideous face . He did not smile . " A fool and a liar . You will thrive in this city . " One of the others , who stood apart , kept his gaze on the floor . No man spoke or looked at his companions . I could taste the fear in the room , and it made clear to me what I must do . " Advise me , fool , " said the Count . " Your advice can be no worse than some I receive . I have enemies who plot to murder me and my sons . I know the identities of all those involved in the plot . What shall I do ? " " Act like a man . Kill them all , and have it whispered everywhere that your hand has done the deed , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do nothing , and there will be two fools in this household . " He did not respond for a time . When he spoke at last , there was no anger in his voice . " You speak boldly . " I spread my arms to display my livery . " I belong to a great house , not a nunnery . Why should I speak softly , and counsel meekness ? " His sons exchanged an approving glance . One of the other men nodded . The fourth gave me a quick hateful glance . " Some members of a great house would , " the Count said . " Tell me , is a man a fool to take a fool 's advice ? " " Sometimes a man is a fool to heed a wise man and sometimes he is wise to listen to a fool . It depends on the man , the fool , and the advice , my lord . " He looked at me for a time in silence , then said , " Entertain us tomorrow at dinner . And now go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a flick of his hand . I backed from his presence , bowing with exaggerated deference to all . I had been summoned to humiliate someone , that much was clear , and now had an enemy in the house . I hoped I had made the right one . The right enemy can be as useful as a dozen good friends . He keeps a man alert . As it happens , my enemy did me neither harm nor good . He was seen no more in the palazzo after that night . Count Ridolfo looked upon life as a serious matter . Even my most grotesque antics could not bring a smile to that cold face . He gave a nod of approval at my juggling and my tumbling , but encouraged no banter . For all he cared , I might as well have been mute . His sons were easier to amuse . Andrea , the eldest , emulated his father . He seldom smiled , but he often murmured , " Well said , well said/ " at a satiric observation . The younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left us , reveled in my bawdry . There was no bawdry in the Count 's presence , nor when the ladies were within hearing . The Contessa spent her waking moments in prayer . I believe she prayed even in her few hours of sleep . Maddalena , the youngest child and only daughter , was the darling of the family . In her , the distinctive family features were gentled and softened . She smiled often , and though fully fifteen years old , was still capable of childlike enthusiasms and affections . Her cats , her dog , her monkey , the birds who came to her window and fed from her hand , all enjoyed her generous love . From the very first time she saw me she was capable of looking at me without shrinking . Unlike the rest of her family , she was fond of my songs and tales of love and chivalry , sometimes stopping outside the kitchen to listen as attentively as any ignorant kitchen wench whenever I chose to entertain the servants of an evening . She attended Mass every morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her brothers . I was sometimes made part of the company . While the brothers ogled the ladies and exchanged with their friends accounts of their previous night 's escapades , Maddalena knelt with bowed head , praying for us all . Once we left those cool echoing spaces and the church doors closed behind us , she became a carefree young lady once again . She was an angel , but human , fully human . Her marriage to the son of a leading family was to take place in the spring . Like all marriages of wealth and power in this city , it was first and foremost an alliance , arranged with the scrupulous care one might give to a treaty between great powers . In truth , that is what it was . The family of her betrothed , landowners and bankers , were wealthier than that of Count Ridolfo , but did not enjoy his stature and his influence . My master had three times been a Lord Prior ; his brother had been elected once to the Signory and served as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal , tall and well-formed , with regular features and deep brown hair that curled at his shoulders . His voice was pleasing to the ear . He smiled easily and often , and his wit coaxed smiles and laughter from every company . I amused myself with the conceit that the Creator , having introduced me to the household , now wished to restore balance in our little universe by adding one who was my opposite - at least in appearance . Jacopo was in truth a beautiful beast , and Maddalena was enchanted by him . She cooed and moaned and sighed over his smile , his voice , his hair , and his eyes , repeated his most banal pleasantries as if they were Holy Writ , and recited over and over the clumsy verses he sent her until the entire household knew them by heart . She wearied everyone with her incessant praise of her Jacopo . I dutifully echoed her , but set my bounds : I would not praise his eyes . They held a warning of danger to come . Deep within them was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have obtained for him whatever he desired , or , that failing , whose wealth enabled him to purchase what he could not seize outright , had the avaricious gaze of the peasant who wants a thing because it exists , because another enjoys it , simply because it is not his . I would have given Jacopo a family crest more fitting than the one he boasted . I would have a gaping mouth and two outstretched hands gules on a field sable , the motto the single word desidero thrice repeated . Jacopo had the face of an angel and the soul of a greedy ape . I had no part in the wedding celebrations . I was lent for a time to Count Sigonio , a friend of my master 's who had expressed admiration for my talents and was at the time in want of a fool . I believe , too , that both families feared that the sight of my face at the wedding would assure that the first child of this union would be a monster . I had once seen the fool of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Fratellino for his custom of donning a miniature friar 's habit and delivering blasphemous sermons to entertain the company . He was a gifted mimic who could perfectly ape the manners and speech of anyone he met , to the delight of the onlookers . Alas for Fratellino , not everyone appreciated his gifts . His body was found one morning on the riverbank . It was said that he fell from a bridge and drowned during a drunken revel . Believe what you will . In my stay with Count Sigonio I confined my mockery to my own appearance , and was much praised and generously rewarded . I also observed and listened , and returned to my master with useful information . Count Ridolfo 's enemies , the Forzos , had been guests at Maddalena 's wedding and had presented the couple with a richly ornamented gold and silver bowl , the work of one of the city 's leading artisans . They had not abandoned their plan to murder the Count and his sons , merely postponed it to a more suitable moment , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , playing the gracious host , the grateful parent , the friend ; in their eyes , the dupe . He bided his time . He had his own plans , and in these I was able to serve him well . It was clear that the Forzos must die if my master and his family were to live safely and prosper in the city . But when they were gone , other enemies equally powerful would remain . The solution to this problem was obvious to me , though it did not occur to others ; if it did , they were hesitant to offer it . I was fortunate to possess a resource that others did not enjoy , and this was the proper time to make use of it . I now had freer access to Count Ridolfo , and when the moment seemed propitious , I suggested to him that it would be well to dispose of as many of his enemies as possible at a single stroke . His stony face came very close to a smile at my suggestion . " What does my fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in the room and said , " First of all , secrecy . " He dismissed all but Andrea , and they left the chamber without a word . " You trust no one , " he said when the door closed behind the last man . " Caution is the strongest armor , " I said . " Your advice . " " A great banquet , the Forzos as honored guests . It must be held the Monday after next . " " And why then ? " he asked . " Because two days following , they dine with their friends and allies the Dati . " The Count and his son exchanged a quick glance . This alliance was unknown to them . I quickly went on , " The Forzos will die before they reach home that night , and all will say - with a little encouragement - that they have been poisoned by the treachery of the Dati . The Dati will be punished for their crime . You will see to that . And you will be rid of both enemies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " They will be poisoned on the night they dine with us , as will you and I and all who sit at table . But I will administer the antidote to those you select . " " So the Forzos die , and the Dati are accused . An admirable plan . " He reflected for a time , then said , " You would have me trust you with my life . " " As I trust you with mine . I will take the poison too , my lord . A double dose , for your double assurance . " Again he reflected , but this time only briefly . Then with a sharp bark of mirthless laughter he said , " It will be so . " And so it was - though not precisely as I had described it . The feast was splendid , the celebration long and hearty . Every member of both our houses attended . I kept the company in an uproar with my quips and antics , and all were merry . When every belly had been filled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everlasting friendship had been sworn , the doors were closed and locked behind our departing guests and every shutter firmly secured . All merriment ceased and we hastened to purge ourselves . For all in our household , purging was unnecessary ; no one had been poisoned . I intended to dispose of our enemies by means of my darker knowledge . But it was essential for my safety that all believed themselves poisoned . I had no wish to die at the stake . The Count would protect an assassin , but even he would not defend a practitioner of the black arts . I conscientiously made certain that all those who had sat at table gagged and retched and heaved their sides to disgorge the sumptuous meats , the excellent wines , the fruits and the sweets and the sauces . When we all had emptied our bellies , I personally administered an unpleasanttasting mixture which I presented as the antidote , and watched them gulp it down eagerly . Their grimaces made a most amusing spectacle , well worth the brief discomfort I was forced to undergo with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plot . As always , they snatched what choice bits they could from the platters and ate heartily of what remained , and so I made sure to season their next day 's meals with my antidote , and to do so in Andrea 's presence . Next day the city talked of nothing but the friendship between our house and the Forzos . Two days after , when that family were found dead and bloated in their palazzo , swollen tongues bulging from their mouths , all were busy babbling of the treachery of the Dati . My master led the cry for justice and saw that it was administered swiftly and sternly . He commissioned a magnificent memorial to his murdered friends . All in all , the Forzo affair was a great victory for him . For me , the second use of my power was a triumph . I , the Count 's fool , became his trusted advisor . For two years and more , I was called upon to do little more than entertain his guests and from time to time , visit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction of all , and needed no exercise of my special knowledge , which pleased me . Only one malediction remained , and I had no wish to use it prematurely . Life was easy and pleasant . So easy was it that I began to grow bored . On the occasion of their third anniversary , Maddalena and her husband came to the Count 's palazzo for a prolonged visit , bringing their little son , Leonardo . He was a healthy , vigorous child with his father 's features and his mother 's nature . He attached himself to me at once , to his mother 's delight and his father 's disgust , but even Jacopo smiled at our joint antics - more , I suspect , to display his even white teeth than to express his pleasure . Maddalena was already great with their second child , and Jacopo played the role of solicitous husband on every occasion , keeping always by her side , whispering to her , taking her arm , gazing on her fondly in company . They seemed a happy couple . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I awoke at the sound of someone at the door , but it was so faint a sound that at first I thought it a cat or a rat brushing against the door as it passed . Then came a soft rhythmic tapping . I armed myself and moved silently to the door . There I waited . Again came the soft tapping and then my name , in a whisper . I knew the voice at once . For an instant I was too astonished to respond . She had come to me in the night , to my chamber . Then she whispered my name again , " Niccolo , Niccolo , help me . " I opened the door and she slipped in as if in flight . She fell to her knees , sobbing , and I stooped to lift her . She threw her arms around me and pulled herself close . I drew away and quickly shut the door . If she were found here it could mean death for us both . " My lady , is there some danger ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you speak of your husband ? " . She clutched my hand in both of hers . " Jacopo is a monster . I have married a monster . " " The fairest man in the city , and you call him a monster ? I am the monster , my lady . " She pressed her head against my chest . Sobbing , she said , " No , Niccolo , you are good . Within , you are good , and kind . I have always seen that . His ugliness is deep inside him , hidden from all eyes . Only those closest to him know of it , and they can tell no one , for no one will believe them . Even my own family see only the surface . " " What would you have me do ? " " Help me . Please , Niccolo , help me ! He will never change . He has beaten me , and I fear what he will do to our son . " Her bare white arms and her face bore no signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " When we learned that I am again with child , he stopped striking me , but he is as cruel as ever in other ways , every way he can be . Help me , Niccolo , I beg you . " " Your father , your brothers - will they do nothing ? " " My father will not listen , and I can not tell my brothers the things he has done to me . I am too ashamed . My mother would only tell me to be a better wife . You are the only one I can trust . You must help me . I will do anything you ask , only help me . " I was astonished . I knew that not even sorcery could make a woman look on me with favor , but I truly believe I might have had Maddalena then and there , in my own bed . I did not yield to the temptation . Even the pleasure of cuckolding the strutting Jacopo was not worth this risk . And I trusted no one with my Uf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your chamber , " I said . " I will help you . You must give me time . " She embraced me . " You are an angel . My faithful angel . " I lay awake for much of the night , pondering her words . My thoughts were not angelic . You aie good and kind , Niccolo . Within , you aie good . Though the matter was grave , her innocence was almost comical . Ridding her of Jacopo posed no problem . I had often entertained myself with fantasies of his murder . I knew I must move with care . Maddalena could be given no reason to suspect my hand in his death . I believe that even had she proof , she would hesitate to betray me , instead condemning herself for inciting me to the deed . Such was her nature . But that innocent and pious nature might undo us both . In time , she might come to regret her rash words . She might even forgive Jacopo , and recant her plea to me . And what if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was equally great whether I chose to act on my promise or to ignore it , so my decision was easily made . Jacopo would die , soon , and by my own hand . My remaining malediction would not be thrown away on a jackal . The deed would give me as much pleasure as it gave relief to Maddalena . Their child was a second son as beautiful as the first . So everyone agreed , and I must accept their assessment . I am a poor judge of beauty . I saw Maddalena one day about a month after the birth , and she had the expression of a hunted creature . Others seemed not to notice . Jacopo died during carnival . His body was found in a narrow passage near the brothels . He was apparently the victim of a quarrel or a robbery . His face had been disfigured with particular savagery . I had planned it carefully . On the evening of his death I was entertaining the Count 's guests at a banquet that lasted well into the morning hours . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure that every guest was befuddled by wine and unaware of the hour , but conscious of my constant presence . Jacopo occupied me for no more than a quarter of an hour , and no one was aware of my brief absence . All who had been present agreed that I was particularly amusing that evening . Our city is not shocked easily , but the violence of this murder was the topic of every conversation for some time . My master saw to that . Who could have perpetrated so vicious an attack on handsome , jovial Jacopo , adoring young husband and loving father of two fine sons , was the subject for much speculation and some fear . The severest and most searching inquiries were demanded by Count Ridolfo , who vowed to seek out the murderer of his beloved son-in-law . He did not succeed . My master judged it wise , for her safety and the care of her sons , that Maddalena return to the family 's palazzo . Jacopo 's family dared make no objection , and soon she was among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonardo and his younger brother , and saw Maddalena daily , but our nighttime conversation was never mentioned . My master summoned me one day to discuss a dinner to be given in honor of certain city officials . When we had settled the details , he said , " Are you content in my service ? " Such a question came unexpectedly from Count Ridolfo , to whom the contentment of others was a matter of small importance . But I did not hesitate . " I am very content . I hope I have been useful . " " I suspect you have been useful in some ways I do not know , and do not care to know . " He paused , and I did not respond . Before I could speak he went on , " You never ask for money . Have you no needs , or do you steal all you require ? " " I serve a great family . I am well fed , comfortably housed , and richly dressed . I live in a grand palazzo and have servants of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as are your friends in the homes I visit . What more could I want ? " " Such contentment is a blessing . But a loyal servant deserves a reward . " He pushed a purse across the table . " Be ready when I require future service . " In the years that followed I have had no need of my occult knowledge . On every occasion I proved myself worthy of Count Ridolfo 's trust and generosity by my wits alone . The time came when he had great need of a faithful servant , for a series of heavy blows fell upon him . His youngest son , Paolo , was killed in a street brawl . Paolo was an idle , foolish fellow , too quick to perceive an insult where none existed , and he paid dearly for his pride . Within the year the two older sons were swept to their deaths in an avalanche while on a mission to France . All his sons had died childless . Of all his children , only Maddalena remained , and she was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now a woman of twentytwo at the height of her beauty , she had not yet remarried . The death of that posturer haunted her . She blotted his cruelty from her memory and persuaded herself that they had had a loving marriage . Her smiles were seen no more . She became as pious as her mother , surpassing even that gaunt and spectral old woman in her devotions . More and more , Count Ridolfo placed his hope in his grandsons and his trust in me , I became their accepted guardian and teacher . I should have been wary when Maddalena began to seek my advice about " our " children . When one day she addressed me in private as " Jacopo , " I let it pass as a lapse of thought or a slip of the tongue . But when she came to my room that night , slipped into my bed , called me husband and coaxed me to her side with fond names , I lost my wits . I was powerless . My strength , my cunning , my dark power were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . My life was in her hands . If I turned her away , what wild accusations might she make ? She need do no more than reveal our conversation on that night so many years ago to destroy me . And yet if I played the role she had cast for me , the consequences could only lead to disaster . But she was beautiful , so beautiful . She gave herself to me eagerly . And the flesh - even a fool 's misshapen flesh - is weak . After that night she came to me regularly , and in our moments together she always called me her Jacopo , praised my beauty and spoke lovingly of our years of married happiness . Yet before others she behaved toward me as to a servant . She knew the truth but could not admit her guilt to herself . Her mind had divided itself in two . One part denied Jacopo 's death , telling her that her husband lived , that she was a loyal and loving wife , innocent of all wrongdoing . But the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had witnessed the deed . On the night when she whispered to me that she was to have our third child , I knew that the masquerade could not continue . I had known the love of a woman , a mad , beautiful woman who looked at me and saw the ghost of the handsome husband whose death she had bought about . Now it must end . I USED A SIMPLE poison in a goblet of wine . Maddalena was discovered kneeling at her prie-dieu , her face buried in her hands , as one in meditation or prayer . She showed no sign of suffering . Her eyes were closed as if in peaceful sleep , and her face bore a faint smile . She had always been too good , too innocent for this world . I felt a certain satisfaction to know that I had ushered her gently into a world where she would be welcomed . I had sent others to a worse place . This last blow fell heavily on Count Ridolfo and left its mark . The deaths of his sons had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manhood in a day . His audacity in conception , his decisiveness in action , his pride in everything left him , and he became suddenly an old man , a fearful prisoner in a world of prowling dangers . But he is useful to me still , and I serve him well . Since the Contessa 's death , not a year following her daughter 's , I have been his sole companion and adviser , always at his side , and with us the two grandsons , the only heirs to this great house . Leonardo thrives , and his grandfather dotes on him . He resembles his father in many ways . Giorgio is a frail and sickly boy , but clever , very clever . He will survive . I still play the fool for them , and from time to time I am called upon to amuse my master and his guests , - for his banquets are as lavish as ever , though less frequent and more selective . Even now , broken and brought low within , he is too important a man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitude and sorrow , still too proud to show feeling . He has his wealth and power and influence , and he has his grandsons , and his faithful Niccolo to watch over them when he is no longer able . They are safely in my hands . As for me , my needs are few , and the Count is generous , most generous . He serves me well . Even now , he is a strong protector . I fear no enemy . I know that no man in this world is ever truly safe from betrayal , injury , and the assassin 's hand ; but I know too that the man who harms me will be punished in ways beyond imagining . I husband my final malediction carefully . For the present , I am content . As for the future , who can say what may be ? Only a fool would dare . Sidebar Copyright c 2006 by John Morressy .
