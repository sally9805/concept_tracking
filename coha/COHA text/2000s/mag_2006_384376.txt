Rubber horses by Dorothy Trojanowski of Brooklyn , N.Y . // Possibly the tip-off was that I was scribbling down " Art Projects That Need Your Help " from the notice board at Artery , the project HQ of Burning Man . They were : DISCO BALL STOLEN FROM " BITCH STOP " ART . BED IN YOUR HEAD needs dear epoxy . BED IN YOUR HEAD needs volunteers . GET VIRGINS LIT ! LIKE GAMES ? A PUZZLE NEEDS VOLUNTEERS TO GUARD IT FROM FLYING AWAY . BRING GLOWSTICKS OR SPARE LIGHTS IF YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I pocketed my pad , a woman gave me a note , and a meaningful look . The note read : " The best coverage of Burning Man has and always will be that which is profoundly personal . Immerse yourself . " That was , in fact , the plan . I pedaled off toward the Man , who is a more galvanic version of the ideogram you see on a men 's room door . This was way out on the playa ( the alkali flats of Nevada 's Black Rock Desert , a space otherwise known for the breaking of land speed records ) . Additional pieces lay here and there , among them The Dreamer ( a giant blue head ) , Clockworks ( a 30-foot-tall wooden clocktower ) and other stuff , including animal and human forms and vessels for future fires . What mud is to an English rock festival , talcum-powder-fine dust is to Burning Man . 1 was wearing goggles and my shoes were so furred that they looked like the finest gray suede imaginable . The mountains around us seemed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment the sky was blue glass , the next I was swallowed by a white-out . On my first visit to Burning Man in 2002 a similar white-out had caught me even further out . I had been shirtless , it had been late afternoon and the temperature had dropped like a stone . Now I wrapped nose and mouth in a scarf , turned and pedaled back to the huge soft target of Black Rock City . This year-Burning Man 's 20th-the city will live again from Aug. 28 to Sept. 4 . Last year Black Rock City , Burning Man 's ephemeral capital , had 38,000 inhabitants . As such , Burning Man is the heir to those other instant conurbations of our era , rock festivals , but there are no T-shirt concessions or backstage passes at Burning Man . It is a free state . In Tabloid World it 's a byword for behavioral extremes , involving costumery , or the lack of it , and gambols with the terrible twins , Sex and Drugs . Among bien pensants , it 's known for actually practicing radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifting " and the application of the mantra LElAVE NO TRACE , meaning that the city should leave the land as untouched as if it had been a shadow passing . For many , though , Burning Man is just the way it bills itself : an arts festival . Indeed , with tickets at a couple of hundred bucks a head , and no comps , it 's a wealthy one . The San Francisco-based Black Rock Arts Foundation has dished out $400,000 for each of the past two years , making it the biggest source of funds for public art in the Bay Area . The professional art world , though , has always dissed Burning Man , seeing it as a playpen for wannabes who ca n't hack it in the " real " art economy . Burners , as regulars call themselves , tend to be scornful of such critiques , and , in their own terms , they are right . Burning Man is about involvement , often about collaboration , and it tends to be about process not product , so it exists by choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take-no-prisoners culture of the art world . Photograph View of the Man burning . // Often this uncriticality has dire results . There 's Suburban Dada all over , and elements that came to make me scream inwardly : Seuss cat-in-the-hat hats , skulls , flowers , fish , soft toys , jokey robots , prancing late de Chirico horses , and ( most especially ) mannequins and mannequin parts . But there are interesting things to be seen at Burning Man too . Or sometimes interesting because not seen . The drought of Pop was striking . Cartoon characters and brand images used to be staples of populist art and there were plenty in 2002 . Now , rare exceptions aside-a Homer Simpson here , a motorized Playboy bunny logo there , a conga line of evil Santas everywhere-they were gone . It seems Mickey has become too corporate to be a metaphor . There was vernacular art , though , some very strong . Like the " Art Cars . " An Art Car is n't just a car with stuff painted on . It must have undergone some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and registered with the DMV ' ' - the Department of Mutant Vehicles-which issues licenses with the disclaimer " BY ENTERING THIS MUTANT VEHICLE YOU AGREE THAT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHATSOEVER THE OPERATORS AND COMPANY OWNER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DAMAGE DONE TO YOU . THIS INCLUDES DEATH ... ENJOY THE RIDE .... " This is very Burning Man-as is the interdependence of freedom and control . " Theme " camps are also part of the visual warp-and-woof , though they tend to be stronger on High Concept-the Nerd Camp , the Flaming Cunts , the Tom Jones Instant Intimacy and Clich Hut-than actual delivery . There are glorious exceptions though . Last year I was taken to the Skinny Kitty Tea House by the curator of the Burning Man art program , LadyBee , ne Christine Kristen . A framed front page of Weekly World News-KITTY GUILTY OF MURDER-hung alongside a cat shrine , dressed with several desiccated cats , faces frozen into their last agonized yowls . In 2002-the theme that year was " The Floating World " -I spotted a silvery-blackish form in the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jellyfish , and spitting brightly colored sparks . It seemed incomprehensible , as if a cartoon had swum into the real world . I figured it out-it was a partially deflated balloon , tugging lights-and felt partially deflated myself , as when somebody has explained a magic trick . But it was beautiful , and strange , Burning Man at its DIY best , showing that you do n't need a Koons/Barney budget . The whole setup had probably cost under a hundred dollars at Radio Shack . Last year there was the ladder-in-the-air . This was a pale-hued metal ladder of brutally simple design . It just went up , up , up , up for 108 feet . It could hardly have been more minimalist , except that a core component of the Burning Man esthetic is interactivity , so the ladder was whispering : Climb me ! Next day I returned , planning to go up a rung or so . No go . It had been cordoned off . Somebody ( I was told ) had slipped . Not ( I was told ) terminally . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anonymity , once the norm at Burning Man , has waned . ( The makers of the ladder were Mark Griffen and Lloyd Aspinwall . The blue head was by Pepe Ozan ) . But anyway , the most powerful art form here is the whole evolving system of Burning Man itself . Larry Harvey , the primary creator of Burning Man , is 56 , with round pale eyes , a pearl-gray Stetson and the gargled speech patterns of an eager teacher . He has somewhat messianic ambitions but requires no cultish following . " What I always hated about hipster scenes and probably would have hated about any of the avant-garde movements is the exclusivity , " he told me . " My people were dust-bowlers . We raised chickens on a farm in Oregon . My father was a carpenter . He 'd been a cowboy when he was young-came West in a covered wagon in 1899.1 went to a suburban high school and embraced their values in a lot of ways but we were outsiders to say the least . " In 1968 he went to San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " We decided that we would score some acid and go back to Oregon . So we met this fellow in the street . We insisted on accompanying him when he went to see his dealer , which made him very nervous . " They stood a couple of blocks away from their dealer 's dealer 's house . " It was a nice house . It was up the hill three or four streets . And I began to see there was an economic system working here . That dealer was probably working with somebody further up the hill . But the hippies were innocent of that . In fact , they were innocent of most things . It was this huge age cohort that only talked to itself . They came from an enormously secure world so they felt they could be bold . It was a world that seemed fixed . Safe . Today the kids have grown up in a world in which nothing is certain . " For twenty minutes on acid one day I believed that everything would just change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place and engulf the world . And after twenty minutes I said to myself ... no ! " Harvey worked as a landscaper in his 20s . His friends were craftsmen , and one of them would entertain of an evening . " It was a version of old-fashioned bohemia , " Harvey said . " He would play guitar . People would argue about ideas . Maybe somebody would paint . " Photograph View of the Lamplighters ' procession . // It set him thinking . Forget the formal structuring of an art career : Just do it ! " So I called a friend and said , " Let 's build a figure . Let 's build a man . Let 's burn him on the beach ! ' ' " They put together an 8-foot figure from lengths of lumber and stood it on Baker Beach , a public beach near San Francisco . This was 1986 . Rumors-Burning Man is a petri dish of rumor-surround this action . One is that Harvey was inspired by The Wicker Man , a cult British movie of 1973 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roasting of a male interloper . Harvey had never seen this movie . A second rumor was that the figure represents a man who had broken up a love affair . Harvey says the Burn was just to celebrate the summer solstice . " When we set it on fire people came running up . It attracted the attention of strangers . And that was rather thrilling , " Harvey says . " If you burn a human form you 're bound to draw a crowd . The response of the people in the public space was very inspiring . A woman ran up and held its hand . Who knows who she was ? So we did it again the next year . Our numbers tripled instantly . " One attendee at the second Burn , who goes by the name of Michael Michael , attached Burning Man to art history . Alternative art history anyway . Michael Michael is a Texan who arrived in California in the mid- ' ' 70s . " My background is electromechanical systems . I was working for Fairchild Semiconductor and other companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . He worked , for instance , with Survival Research Laboratories , whose giant pieces , both authorized and renegade , involved flame-throwers and explosions . This is something of a Bay Area tradition , by the way . In 1975 , the artists ' collective Ant Farm created Media Burn , in which performance artists drove a Cadillac with a built-in video camera into a mound of burning TV sets in the parking lot of San Francisco 's Cow Palace . In 1986 Michael picked up a flyer in a Whole Earth grocery store . It listed events recommended by an outfit called the Cacophony Society . The events rang bells . Among the things that had gotten his attention when he arrived in the city had been the doings of a group called the Suicide Club . " They took their name from the Robert Louis Stevenson book . They were a small group of urban adventurers . Maybe 30 or 40 people , " he says . " They were having these wonderful adventures . Throwing parties in abandoned buildings . . . climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage plays in basements and railway tunnels . . . . But they were very underground and I did n't know how to make contact with them . " He now learned that the Cacophony Society had absorbed some elements of the nowsuicided Suicide Club . So had another group , the Billboard Liberation Front . The Suicide Club had just been a bunch of youngbloods . The Billboard Liberation Front on the other hand had a hefty dose of ideology , being effectively an offshoot of the Situationist International . When Guy Debord created the S.I . in the late ' ' 5Os out of elements of Marxism and Dada , he preached that mass media had so drained our world of meaning that it had become what he called the " Society of the Spectacle . " An authoritarian drunk , Debord believed that the only way of liberating people into " real " life was to pitch them into unexpected , created situations . The S.I . came to prominence during the student movement in Paris in 1968 . It then quirkily dissolved itself in 1971 , worldwide-except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bicyclists and a parachutist on the playa. // Michael went to work for the Cacophony Society newsletter . He reached out to other avant-garde groups , like Survival Research Laboratories and the Church of the SubGenius . He built up traditions like the " Zone trip . " This took its name from Andrei Tarkovsky 's 1979 sci-fi movie , Stalker , in which a guide takes travelers into an ever-mutating landscape . " We would get a bunch of people and one or two rented vans and we would drive somewhere far away . Usually it was Los Angeles . " We would get to a point where through sleep deprivation , drugs or whatever , everything became very unreal . And we had this ceremony called CROSSING THE LINE . We would get out . We would draw a line on the ground . And we would all hold hands and step across . And when we were on the other side , everything was different . And mentally it was . And we would do a surrealistic tour . " ( The Situationists had called this a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burn and listed Burning Man as an event to attend in the Cacophony Society newsletter the following year . " We brought in like 150 people , " he says . I was on the Cacophony mailing list and still have the June 1990 issue , a page of apple-green paper listing such events as a group read-in of Finnegans Wake , The Burning Man entry reads : " The erection and destruction of a monumental human figure at the Summer Solstice is meant to dramatize the passage of time .... The final event ( will ) be held on June 30th . Burning Man is a non-prophet organization . " Harvey is nowhere mentioned . That year 800 people showed up , attracting the park police . They allowed the Man , which was now 40 feet high , to be erected- " I think they were impressed by the workmanship , " Harvey says-but vetoed the Burn . Another venue had to be found . The Harvey group was told of an event in the Black Rock Desert-a croquet game , with a giant ball and huge hoops with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfect . They drove out to the desert in a caravan . Two hundred and fifty people watched the Burn that Labor Day weekend . Michael listed the event as a " Zone trip , " but that was about it for the San Francisco Cacophony Society . Burning Man remained in Nevada . " So we first had to build culture on this desert playa and out of that came the artwork , " Michael says . " At the beginning it was very simple . It 's costume and clothing and performance . The earliest art we had was the theme camps . And people were setting up very elaborate camps . Almost always with some kind of costuming . And there was the Shooting Gallery . There 's a little road that goes alongside the playa And we put rows of stuffed animals and we drove by and would shoot at these stuffed animals ' hearts ! You know , with high-powered rifles ! Nevada is very Western . There 's a very strong connection with firearms and survival , which grew out of the American West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden man and burnt it . the locals thought we were a bunch of simps . And then they found out that we had guns and we could use them . And then we were OK . It was a little silly to them but we were unusual independent characters and that is respected out in the West . " Leo Villareal , who had studied art at Yale and was then an intern in a research lab in PaIo Alto , first went to Burning Man in 1994 . " It was a thousand , fifteen hundred people , very small , " says the artist , who now shows his fluorescent light constructions regularly in New York and Los Angeles . " There were stranger people than there are now . It was more pagan . There were drums and installations of skulls and strange objects . 1 do n't remember Art Cars , I do n't remember elaborate installations . I do n't remember big freestanding sculptures . There was only the Burning Man , surrounded by tents . Photograph Omar Kabish the Fish by the Walkers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was definitely a feeling of danger . There were parts of the playa that were wet . Your car could get stuck and if you did n't have sufficient water basically you could die . Everyone was sort of huddled together . I was absolutely immersed in virtual reality and you felt very much that you were in some kind of cyberspace experience . The blankness of the landscape ! It 's just so barren that anything 's possible . " In 1994 Burning Man went into cyberspace . That whole culture ballooned on the Internet , and Black Rock City with it . In 1996 the city was large and wild . There were many traffic accidents , and somebody was killed , run over in a tent . It was make-or-break in other ware too . The tone was set by that year 's theme , Hellco . A Satan figure marched Burners out to such parodies of commercial brands as Starfux and Caca Bell . " It was a very Manichcan year . " Harvey says . " I fought a great battle with the Punks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU BE THE JUDGE . The Punk contingent believed-and hoped , really-that it would be the last Burning Man . They said we do n't want uncool people coming . I asked them to draw up a list of uncool people . When I added them all together it seemed everybody hated everybody . My position was that anybody could come . Period . " " Anybody " included the huge subculture of Deadheads . " These are kids who grew up in culture-free zones , " says John Perry Barlow , songwriter for the Grateful Dead . " You would see seven of them in a Volkswagen bus with a dollar between them , going to a concert , and they would get in . " That whole parking-lot culture fed directly into Burning Man . The Manichean struggle of ' ' 96 had a real-world outcome . " I felt very strongly that what we needed was some kind of architectural symbol that would demarcate public space . And if you did it in a way that signalled transcendency people would respect it . I decided on lampposts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . " Black Rock City , as it is now configured , was born in ' ' 97 ( the Black Rock Arts Foundation was set up in May 2001 in order to fund artists ) . The lampposts , which are ritually lit by lamplighters with kerosene every evening , look as ceremonious as any in London or Paris and march out north , south , east and west from Center Camp to the temples and to the Man . And what at first seems riotous post-apocalyptic anarchy soon comes to seem as organically structured as a nautilus shell . In the middle is the caf , which is a meeting and performance place . As you are required to arrive in Burning Man with all the food , drink and other supplies you need , with the " gifting " economy to supply variety , the caf is the only place your money is good . " San Francisco is a coffee-house culture , " Harvey explains . The city grows around the center , like a more homespun version of Le Corbusier 's Ville Radieuse . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vehicle , from dilapidated school buses to the swell RVs that often accommodate the cyberlords . Last year , Monster.com was there , as was a poobah from Pixar , who was accoutered in a sort of One Million Years BC loincloth . " The level of participation has gone steadily upwards as the population has increased , " Harvey says . " People keep telling you about how great the old days were . But in the old days Burning Man was n't as participatory as it is now . IVe got news for people ! I was there ! " Photograph Harrod Blank 's O My Gawd ! // Art of one sort or another was all over Black Rock City . I watched an attempt to hoist an effigy taller than Burning Man , a 70 footer . It toppled . Most of the set pieces , the ones partially funded by grants from the Black Rock Arts Foundation , were out in the playa . I tootled around in a golf cart with LadyBee . We looked for a mobile piece by Burning Man 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavilions , called " temples . " from recycled wood , which are consumed by ceremonial flames the night after the burning of the Man . We then checked out other ambitious projects , which veered from the formalist through the conceptual to the goofy . The less meaningful the pieces , the better they looked to me . I loved the Thunderdome , a location-appropriate Mad Max arena within which contestants swung on cords , biffing each other with padded cudgels . A sign reading DAYS SINCE LAST INJURY was n't kidding-a woman had just broken her wrist-and the site had provoked a reaction , the Thumperdome , a nearby miniature using soft toys . I also liked the Temple of Dust , which was actually made from dust ( the only thing I saw made from available local materials ) . Photograph Sign for the Picasso theme camp . // Across the playa lay Mark Perez 's Life-Sized Mousetrap , a fairground-ready blow-up of the children 's game . This , 1 learned , had not been funded by the Black Rock Arts Foundation . Apparently , 2004 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A group of artists had mounted a rebellion against " The Org . " ( " The Org , " as in " organization , " numbers six equal partners , two of them being Harvey and Michael . They own the Burning Man logo and various other key concepts . If any of the six chooses to walk away their payout will be just $20,000 . ) The mutineers called themselves Org 2 , elected the polymorphic Michael to their committee , raised $25,000 and began funding projects of their own . So ' ' 05 was like ' ' 96 all over again . But not quite . The Black Rock Arts Foundation upped its funding to the current level ( $400,000 ) and Org 2 was now a more or less amicable part of Burning Man . Surely a first in radical politics , this . LadyBee and I drove on . We stopped off for coffee in Central Camp and I learned about the origins of LadyBee . She arrived in New York to follow an art career in 1984 and showed at a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute that there was a populist thing , community-based , that was going on . But then it just seemed to get funneled into the bigger , more powerful art world . I just could n't deal with it . By about 1990 I had grown so alienated from art that I began to lose the ability to make my work any more . By the time you 're into your mid- to late 30s , unless youVe had some recognition and success in your career , it becomes very difficult to carry on . I think typically a lot of art school grads switch careers at that point . " Photograph The Giant Roving Head by Dalee Huntsman of Reno , New . // LadyBee moved to San Francisco in 1992 . She joined the Cacophony Society . Hence , inexorably , to Burning Man , where she began curating in 1998 . What are the protocols for inclusion ? " Burning Man is still an event where anybody can show up with a piece of art and it will be put up somewhere . Although we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start mapping and registering things . The only time we would turn something down is if it involved hate speech or some physical danger to people . We might nave to draw the line . If they wanted to do some really dangerous pyrotechnic thing , we would probably nix that , " she says . The Burning Man movement is spreading . " That 's the interesting development at the moment-our regional groups . Alaska ... various places ... and they put on their own Bums . They do n't call them Burning Man . There 's one in Canada called Burning Mooseman . And there 's one in Austin every year called Burning Flipside . And , " We 're very happy with this regional thing . We own the logo and the idea but we do n't feel there can only be one Burning Man . We 'd be quite happy to see events all over the world .

" Harvey drove me out to look at Generic Art Project , an installation a mile out on the playa . We passed the clocktower . Pepe 's blue head was in the distance . It was a brilliant day , a scorcher . The golf cart broke down . We got out and began to push . A man pedaled up . We must have been an odd sight . " Hi Larry ! " he hailed , but did n't stop . More cyclists approached . " Larry , " 1 said , " If these are your people , now might be the time to ask them to haul you in triumph through the streets of Black Rock City . " " No . I 'm going to tell everybody this is our art project , " he said . We huffed back to his compound . I have seen people touch Harvey in public , pat him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is , in Black Rock City . He would seem oblivious . So why do n't famous artists go to Burning Man ? Silly question , really . Can one for a solitary second imagine the willful obsessives who have made so much of our best art-Donald , Iudd ? Richard Serra ? - sharing in the Coffee Tent ? They would suck the air out of the place . There are , of course , genial and populist-minded artists , and they include some of the most effective . Indeed , Mark di Suvero and Rirkrit Tlravarujia 's Peace Tbwer would surely be wholly at home at Burning Man . But what of Jeff Koons 's floral Puppy , Claes Oldenburg 's soft sculptures ? What about Ilya Kabakov ? Di Suvero may make rides , but not ephemeral ones . Oldenburg and Koons would melt back into toyland . Kabakov " s installations require space , time and ( hardest to come by ) solitude . Mark Pauline of Survival Research Laboratories has another problem .

I freely predict that the vernacular arts-the cars , the camps , the performances-will be as overwhelming as always , but Burning Man is not a sculpture park , nor will it become one .

He adds , " It 's more a community . I do n't feel compelled to go out and look at all the pieces . " There in great art at Burning Man . It 's the whole extraordinary machine of Burning Man itself .
