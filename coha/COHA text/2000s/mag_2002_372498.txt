Costello loves to play the mad inventor , mixing exotic rhythms , jazzy melodies and baffling metaphors into songs that dazzle for their strangeness rather than any feeling they convey . But Costello is at his best when he kicks back and reverts to the witty post-punker he was in 1978 , a bespectacled dork with a chip on his shoulder and an uncanny knack for turning out catchy tunes . This album is so much fun , and Costello 's best in a long time , because of how often he returns to that clever post-punker mode . Instead of seeming dated , these moments feel right in tune with the current resurgence of guitar rock , and songs such as Tear Off Your Own Head ( It 's a Doll Revolution ) and 45 are as good as the better songs by any of Britain 's current up-and-comers . He may be getting as fleshy as the original Elvis , but at this rate he 'll never be as irrelevant . <P>  --  B.N .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
