Terror in the Middle East <P> Millions of parents around the world know what to do when two of their children squabble over a toy  --  nobody gets it WORLD , Oct. 23 . Just upgrade the city of Jerusalem to " too holy for anybody " and put a permanent military force around it . Clerics can get in with a pass , and everybody else can take pictures from a distance . If they ca n't live with that , clear everyone out and destroy the site . Better a holy memory than a killing ground that perpetuates death by its very presence . PHIL BRADY Philadelphia <P> While there can be no excuse for the killing of the Israeli reservists , there is similarly no excuse for the brutal murder of children and unarmed protesters by the Israelis . ZAKA SHAFIQ Toronto <P> Why are there so many pictures of Palestinian youths and men running from or being fired upon by Israeli soldiers ? Why is it never mentioned that the soldiers are defending themselves from attacks by these mobs ?

CRAIG RINGEL Massapequa Park , N.Y . <P> You said Arafat is looking for an " enduring legacy , " just as President Clinton is . I find it hard to believe the great leaders of the past were worried about such things . Winston Churchill was too involved in winning World War II to think about his legacy . If he had given it some thought , he probably would have made some bad choices favored by public opinion instead of doing what he thought needed to be done . History proved him right .

HANNA ABOULGHAR Cairo <P> While I can understand the frustration of Palestinians who for years have been led to believe they will regain the whole of the land taken by Israel , I can not condone the double standards of their leaders . The death of children is always a tragedy , no matter what political stance is taken by their elders . The guilt for those deaths must be sought not only among the security forces but also among the scheming adults who willingly sent them out to the front lines . ZVI BAR Petach Tikva , Israel <P> While the death of the 12-year-old Palestinian boy caught in cross fire was terrible , it was nevertheless an accident , and Israelis across the political spectrum immediately expressed deep regret . By contrast , the beating and killing of the Israeli reservists in Ramallah was intentional . The Palestinians killed the Israelis with their bare hands and then showed them to a cheering mob .
