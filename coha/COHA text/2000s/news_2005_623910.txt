<p> The consensus is the globe is warming <p> Editor  --  Debra J. Saunders ' Nov. 17 column , " Thin green line is bad science , " illustrates a common misunderstanding of science and the issue of global warming . Saunders ' column includes the quote : " Consensus science is n't science . " In fact , science is about collecting data , testing hypotheses and arriving at conclusions based on the evidence . The reason for consensus among scientists is that the evidence is overwhelmingly clear that the planet is warming . <p> While it is true that the planet has been warming since the last glacial maximum 18,000 years ago , in recent decades the rate of warming has been accelerating , corresponding with warming that was predicted given the input of massive amounts of greenhouse gases ( mainly carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels ) into the atmosphere . <p> Interestingly , page A4 of the Nov. 17 Chronicle contains an article about a study published in Nature about how climate change is already affecting the Sierra snowpack . Just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have provided unequivocal evidence of climate change . <p> KAREN GROVE <p> Geoscience professor <p> San Francisco State University  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Do we really need another article from a nonscientist decrying human activity as a significant cause of global warming ? Debra J. Saunders equates global-warming dissenters with the scientists who established that bacteria cause ulcers . In fact , just as with the ulcer story , it took time for data indicating a human role in climate change to reach scientific consensus . <p> Concerning the population bomb scare being a " yawn , " it is hard not to conclude that millions of deaths from starvation , species extinction , forest devastation , fisheries collapse , and , dare I say it , global warming , are caused at least in part by overpopulation . <p> As for Michael Crichton 's supposed expertise on the subject , do you want to get advice on your heart condition from someone trained in climatology who writes novels for a living ? <p> MARILYN LEMMON <p> El Cerrito <p> UC is like Enron <p> Editor  --  I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " UC piling extra cash on top of pay . " I also want to say that the responses in the Letters on Nov. 16 from UCSF 's chancellor and UC 's president amounted to nonsense . <p> I work for UCSF at San Francisco General Hospital and know firsthand that UC is the Enron of public education . We have to fight tooth and nail for a 2 percent raise while UC 's top brass routinely receives bonuses equal to more than my annual salary . It is an assault on the idea of a nonprofit public institution . <p> I would like to highlight another gross and unjust UCSF practice : The recent implementation of a two-tier salary system for social workers . The university recently gave large equity increases to social workers employed at the UCSF Medical Center , while giving a mere 2 percent to the many hard-working social workers who work in non-medical center positions . <p> To add insult to injury , UCSF has refused to meet and discuss this issue . This is standard operating procedure for UC . This is cause for shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dept. of Psychiatry <p> San Francisco General Hospital  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  In his Nov. 16 letter , UCSF Chancellor J. Michael Bishop defends UC policies that entitle Bishop to moonlight for thousands of dollars of extra income while at the same time earning more than $350,000 in annual salary , living in a UC-paid mansion and dining at a private club paid for by UC-paid membership fees . <p> Bishop concludes that none of these " represents a violation of law , university policy , codes of conduct , or standards of practice at other research universities . " <p> Amid the shocking revelations appearing in The Chronicle about the outrageously extravagant pay and perks afforded to top UC administrators , Bishop 's statement , if true , is the most shocking of all . <p> MARK D. HARMON <p> Belmont <p> Pure terrorism <p> Editor  --  " Terrorism is the warfare of the poor and weak . Warfare is the terrorism of the rich and powerful . " Robert Koehler 's Nov. 18 column illustrates the truth of that statement . What are " shock and awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism , especially when the victims are just " collateral damage " ? <p> How have we come to this ? I weep for our country . <p> GEORGE CUNHA <p> San Rafael <p> Is ' any means to an end ' Bush policy ? <p> Editor  --  As Robert Koehler expresses outrage in his Nov. 18 column , " Shake and bake , " about the latest atrocity in Iraq , the use of a napalm-like substance called MK-77 , sanctioned by the Bush administration , and calls for a fresh burst of ... something , what would that something be ? How about demanding accountability from those who authorized the use of these barbaric chemical weapons ? I call for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to resign ( or better yet , get fired ) ! <p> I 'm furious about their " any means to an end " attitude that justifies lying , torturing , using chemical weapons , outing CIA agents and the list goes on . It 's about time the American people begin holding their leaders accountable for decisions , both foreign and domestic , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , we just become another hypocritical nation trying to bully our way around the world . America stands for so much more than that ! <p> JUDY TALLEY <p> Berkeley  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  So Mike Singer , Eleanor Traeg ( Letters , " Lies or truth behind going to war , " Nov. 18 ) and other die-hard Republicans are upset that Democrats would want to undermine our president by accusing him of misleading us into war . <p> I do n't get why they are so incensed that American citizens would have the audacity to want to know the truth about the war in Iraq . It is our right in a democracy to question and demand the truth from our leaders . It is dangerous not to question and demand . Admit it , this administration is out of control . Layer by layer , the truth is revealed . If that 's undermining the president , then in Bush 's own words , " bring it on ! " We deserve nothing less . <p> JILL PRICCO <p> Berkeley <p> What a country <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " U.S. put ex-con in charge of cash for rebuilding of Iraq " ; then below , " Sheehan convicted of White House protest . " Is America great , or what ? <p> ALEX von HAUFFE <p> San Fancisco <p> Factory farms and bird flu <p> Editor  --  Where is the article about bird flu that addresses what must surely be the cause of the spread of this disease : the abysmal , overcrowded conditions in which millions of chickens , ducks and turkeys are kept ? The spread of this virus will not stop until the sickness that is industrialized farming stops . <p> What would happen if we showed some basic humanity to chickens and treated them humanely for the few weeks before slaughter ? We 'd see a benefit in terms of stopping the spread of avian flu and we 'd be doing something about human obesity problems caused by too much consumption of fast food . <p> The avian flu is a wake-up call telling us to de-industrialize the raising of food animals but , instead of listening , we slaughter them , throw chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrives in the United States , we must accept that we invited it in with our inhumane , unhealthy practices . <p> MAGGIE RUFO <p> Novato <p> You ca n't change reality <p> Editor  --  Regarding " Kansas challenges Darwin " ( Nov. 9 ) : Changing the definition of science to make room for the supernatural will not alter the fact that science and religion are incompatible . Science seeks natural explanations for natural phenomena . It does so by logical inferences from observable facts and experimentation . Science relies on reason and evidence . <p> Religion , in contrast , relies on supernatural " explanations " for natural phenomena . It demands belief unsupported by evidence and/or contrary to facts . Religion relies on faith . <p> Just as evolution and creationism are mutually exclusive and naturally pitted against each other , so are science and religion . Changing definitions will not change reality . <p> DAVID HOLCBERG <p> Ayn Rand Institute <p> Irvine <p> Ralph Edwards <p> Editor  --  The late Ralph Edwards was a member of the Cal Marching Band and one of the band 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would n't it be fitting if the Cal Band played a tribute to one of its greatest ?
