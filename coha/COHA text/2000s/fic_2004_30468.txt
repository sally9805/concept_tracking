Chapter One September 8 , 1940 11:15 a.m . There 's barely enough time to go to the beach before Maurice comes to pick her up for lunch , but she does n't want to miss seeing the ocean for the last time . The rain , which has poured down for the past three days , has finally stopped and washed the sky a deep , spotless blue . She hurries through the bungalow , impersonal now that most of the furniture has been moved , folds a blanket into her tapestry bag , and puts on rubber galoshes over her soft woolen slippers ; the sand might still be damp . The old steamer trunk stands in the middle of the empty parlor , where the movers have left it , after having brought it up from the basement the day before . The trunk is smaller than she remembers it , its leather scuffed and scratched from years of use . She runs a finger through the dust . It 's been forty years . She struggles to slide open the locks . A heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumble along one side of the trunk , then the other . She had slipped in the diary afterward , hastily , she remembers . She pulls out a copy of Madame Chrysanthme , a novel by Pierre Loti , then a catalogue of the 1900 World Expo . That one , too , she must have put in the trunk later . Has she misplaced the diary ? She finds a few more books , a photo album with a red leather cover , a blue ledger filled with a list of items : white handkerchiefs , pillowcases , tablecloths with point lanc or Valenciennes , each priced in piastres . Finally , her hand feels a rectangular object at the bottom of the trunk . She pulls it out . Yes , it 's the brown notebook . It smells damp and smoky . Without opening it she puts it into her bag and quickly walks out . Drops of water festoon the latticework running under the roof of the bungalow . In the garden , she notices , the hollyhocks , which have grown tall and wild over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink , as if their colors were running with the late summer rain . Her joints are swollen with arthritis and her fingers a little twisted at the knuckles . She 's carrying her big tapestry bag by the handle . She 's put on an apron over her dress as if she were going to the backyard to pick a lettuce or a head of chard for dinner , and a cardigan over it ; it 's cool by the ocean . The dress is navy blue , printed with tiny white birds or windmills . The cardigan is hand-knitted in a shade of lilac or puce , or just plain gray . Her legs are covered with thick , white cotton stockings . On her feet are the slippers with soft soles and gray pom-poms , and the rubber galoshes over them . The dories are leaning drunkenly , pastel blotches in the morning sun , their masts teetering low above the wet sand . Just as they had that day when he had come up to her , in his big black overcoat , holding his hat over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride , before the birth of Daniel , Armand had taken her to Paris and they had gone to visit an exhibition of paintings everybody was talking about . The canvases were covered with tiny splashes of color that blurred when you came up close . But if you took a step back , the scene quivered to life . People said it was sloppy , not good art , and yet now , the beach in the late morning , dotted with the hulls of the dories , mottled with the flickering shadows cast by high , wind-swept clouds , reminds her of those paintings . She spreads the blanket at the foot of the dunes , sits down , removes her rubber galoshes , and takes the notebook out of her tapestry bag . Forty years , she thinks again . Forty years that she has n't seen it or even opened that trunk . It had remained closed through all her moves , from Velluire to Maillezais , from Maillezais to Le Gu de Velluire , from Le Gu de Velluire to Villa Saint-Claude , here , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was originally embossed with arabesques in a Moorish style , probably to imitate Moroccan leather . She opens it . A few letters and yellowed newspaper clippings slip out on her lap . Some of the pages are stuck together . She separates them carefully in order not to tear them . The faint blue lines are barely decipherable now , and the original violet or blue ink has turned a pale umber . Several pages are covered by foreign words dotted with accents .

Most do n't mean anything to her anymore . A loose page in a thick paper , folded four times , reveals a row of Chinese characters . One of them , she recognizes , spells out her name . The others are indecipherable to her now . She leafs back to the beginning of the diary and reads the first entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say things always happen for a reason . Do they ?
