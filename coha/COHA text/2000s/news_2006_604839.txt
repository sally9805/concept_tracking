<p> As the NFL playoffs prepare to enter the first weekend of what will lead to Super Bowl XL on Feb.5 at Detroit 's Ford Field , USA TODAY 's Jarrett Bell runs through a dozen questions football fans should consider as the 12 teams make a run for the championship . <p> In some ways , it seems like a season of destiny for the Seahawks , who posted the NFC 's top record and claimed home-field advantage for the playoffs . If not destiny , at least they have reversed some issues . <p> MVP candidate Shaun Alexander won the NFL rushing title with 1,880 yards after falling short by a yard last year . With a rebuilt defense , the habit of allowing big fourth-quarter comebacks vanished . The dropped passes are n't glaring anymore , either . <p> Since losing to the St. Louis Rams in their playoff opener last season , the Seahawks are 8-0 at Qwest Field . Even better , Mike Holmgren has the NFL 's highest-scoring team ( 28.3 points a game ) . That 's something to ponder for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When the Panthers advanced to Super Bowl XXXVIII two years ago , they had the NFL 's fourth-leading rusher in Stephen Davis . This time they enter the playoffs with big-play artist Steve Smith tying for the NFL lead with 103 catches , while the 31-year-old Davis is on injured reserve with a bum knee . <p> When DeShaun Foster bolted for 165 yards in Sunday 's playoff-clinching victory at Atlanta , it was just Carolina 's second 100-yard rushing game of the season  --  both achieved against the Falcons defense , which ended the year ranked 26th against the run . <p> The Panthers did n't suddenly become a passing team . They passed on 48% of their snaps , compared with 47% in 2003 . The big difference is they rushed for 412 fewer yards than in 2003 , an extra 25-plus yards a game that could come in handy when emphasis on ball control and reduced risk goes up a notch in the playoffs . <p> Coach Joe Gibbs brings his Redskins to face Tampa Bay with the longest current winning streak of any playoff team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against divisional foes . <p> Since Gibbs returned in 2004 , the Gregg Williams-directed defense has been among the NFL 's best . Gibbs has tweaked the offense enough to improve the protection and establish the signature running game led by Clinton Portis ' 1,516 yards . Add big-play receiving aces in Santana Moss and Chris Cooley , and there is balance . <p> Health issues exist with Portis , revived quarterback Mark Brunell and cornerback Shawn Springs among the notables , but confidence is high . The Redskins have beaten three NFC playoff entrants  --  Seattle , Chicago and the New York Giants  --  and nearly won in Tampa in Week 10 . <p> Bears quarterback Rex Grossman 's comeback might also spark the return of Muhammad as a difference-maker in the passing game . Muhammad led the NFL with 16 touchdown receptions in 2004 , a good reason why little time was wasted in luring him to the Windy City . <p> Muhammad became such fast friends with Grossman during offseason work that he attended the quarterback 's wedding . But his production took a blow with the broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kyle Orton managing the offense for the bulk of the season , Muhammad finished with four touchdowns and 750 yards . <p> He is no speed burner , and with the NFL 's best defense in tow , the Bears are not built for shootouts . But " Moose " could provide Grossman with the security blanket every passer needs at crunchtime . <p> The last few weeks , the continuity of the Giants defense has been affected by a rash of injuries at linebacker . They had another scare when Nick Greisen was shaken up in their division title-clinching win at Oakland . Greisen , the only one of the six linebackers to open the season still standing for the regular-season finale , returned to finish the game . <p> Getting back Pro Bowl-bound Antonio Pierce from a high ankle sprain would be a huge boost , but that 's hardly a certainty this week . The team is more hopeful that Reggie Torbor can return from a hamstring injury . Still , it 's a group with three players signed within the last three weeks . Before Saturday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But it helps to have Pro Bowl defensive ends up front in Michael Strahan and Osi Umenyiora and the NFL 's No.2 rusher , Tiki Barber , as a ball-control weapon to ease pressure on inconsistent young quarterback Eli Manning . <p> In two games since he was sacked a season-high seven times at New England , Bucs quarterback Chris Simms has been sacked three times . That 's heading in the right direction for a team that has allowed 41 sacks , more than any playoff squad . <p> Gruden has tried to scheme through the protection problems all season . He has reined in some of his more creative designs and often sends just two receivers out while getting heavy use out of max-protection formations such as two-tight-end sets . <p> It helps that rookie Carnell " Cadillac " Williams fuels the rushing game and Simms  --  who did n't throw an interception in six of his 10 starts  --  keeps mistakes to a minimum . Simms throws a great deep ball , but without the blocking he ca n't connect with polished burner Joey Galloway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they did n't get a sack . Undoubtedly , blitz-happy Washington will try to dispute the flow much more this time . <p> Bill Belichick is still the most resourceful coach in the NFL . In addition to losing coordinators Charlie Weis and Romeo Crennel , the Patriots lost 45 man-starts to injury and managed to win another AFC East title . They got stronger as the season progressed and key players returned . <p> The defense has all-pro defensive end Richard Seymour back . Tedy Bruschi came back from a stroke , although there 's a mystery surrounding the linebacker 's injured knee . Corey Dillon ( the Patriots are 5-0 when he rushes 20 times ) is again being counted on to lessen the load on Tom Brady , who made up for the running back 's injury problems by passing for an NFL-high 4,110 yards . <p> But the one player the Patriots ca n't get back is all-pro safety Harrison . The vulnerable secondary has started six strong safeties since Harrison tore three knee ligaments in September . No playoff team has allowed more touchdown passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much that the Bengals finished the regular season with their only consecutive losses ; it 's the manner in which they occurred , allowing a combined 74 points . <p> Cincinnati allowed Kansas City 537 yards Sunday . Larry Johnson 's 201-yard rushing performance was an eerie reminder of what happened the last time the Pittsburgh Steelers visited Paul Brown Stadium  --  they punished the Bengals with 221 ground yards . When the Bengals ' season-opening four-game winning streak ended at Jacksonville in early October , they allowed 181 rushing yards . <p> A suddenly battered defense , which tied a franchise record with 44 takeaways , can expect a similar gut-check in the franchise 's first playoff appearance since 1990 . And the lack of sharpness is n't exclusive to the defense . The three points scored at Kansas City , albeit with breakout quarterback Carson Palmer sitting out for the bulk of time , marked the fewest in 48 games with Marvin Lewis as coach . <p> Jerome Bettis maintains one reason he returned for a 13th season was the chance to play for a championship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured runner ; fast Willie Parker rushed for 1,202 yards . But Bettis , who had three touchdowns in his specialized role Sunday , still symbolizes the power rushing game that is Steelers football and is so critical to keeping pressure off quarterback Ben Roethlisberger . <p> Big Ben 's 98.6 passer rating ranked third in the NFL , but he averaged just 19.2 passes in the nine victories that he started this season . In three losses , Roethlisberger threw an average of 31.7 passes . The Steelers ' formula is still heavy on running tough and stopping it with the NFL 's No.3-ranked run defense . On a four-game winning streak matching their longest of the season , the Steelers outscored opponents 115-33 . <p> With a 40-13 blowout of Tennessee on Sunday , the physical Jaguars sure looked to be playoff ready . With steady progress in coach Jack Del Rio 's three seasons , they do n't appear ready to drop off as the Bears did after a 13-win season in 2001 was punctuated by a series of improbable finishes . <p> But Jacksonville 's record has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished with winning records . Against teams that finished with losing records  --  such as San Francisco , Arizona and sweeps against Houston and Tennessee  --  the Jaguars were 9-1 . Sure , they scored 78 points the last two games , but those were against Houston and the Titans . <p> If Byron Leftwich returns after missing five games with a broken ankle , he 'll have to knock the rust off against a defense known for the wrinkles it throws at young quarterbacks . <p> When last seen in the playoffs , the Broncos were getting torched by Peyton Manning . Denver 's last two seasons ended in RCA Dome blowouts . To get to the Super Bowl they might have to go back there . <p> They have improved with rookie cornerbacks Darrent Williams and Domonique Foxworth reversing a string of bad luck with highly drafted cornerbacks . When all-pro Champ Bailey battled injuries early in the season , the rookies held down the fort . Now Bailey is back , safety John Lynch is on an all-pro level again and defensive coordinator Larry Coyer is aggressive with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any playoff team ( 29th ) , it has allowed just 16.1 points a game . <p> Added to the evolution of quarterback Jake Plummer ( who has significantly reduced his mistake rate ) and a 1-2-3 punch at running back , the Broncos are poised to get their first playoff win since John Elway retired . But to achieve that and more , a secondary that has seen Williams hobbling in recent weeks must pass additional tests . <p> After their last two seasons ended in the cold , under the gray skies that blanket Patriots weather , the Colts earned the right to stay at home throughout the AFC playoffs . If they must play the Patriots again , it will be in an AFC title game played indoors . <p> For an offense that relies so much on rhythm , dome-controlled weather is a plus . The big-play defense , which gets most of its sacks from a D-line that specializes in getting a quick jump off the snaps , is that much faster on turf , too . Especially when the noise can be so deafening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchdown less than last season . <p> In becoming more physical , the Colts increased their ability to win with different styles . <p> After the bid for a perfect season was halted , they are challenged to stay focused on the biggest prize while the emotions flow after the recent death of coach Tony Dungy 's 18-year-old son .
