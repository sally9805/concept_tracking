His strong base of supporters could turn the tide in his favor . <p> Either Reed or Cagle will face one of five Democrats in the November general election . Former state Sen. Greg Hecht , former state Rep. Jim Martin , state Sen. Steen Miles of Decatur , and businessmen Griffin Lotson and Rufus Terrill are in the race . <p> Hecht and Martin have each raised well over $1 million for their war chests , but Miles could take a big chunk of the crucial African-American vote . <p> Legislature <p> Few political observers expect a significant shift in the makeup of either the Senate , which has been under GOP control since 2003 , or the House , which Republicans took in 2005 . <p> All of Georgia 's 180 House and 56 Senate members are up for re-election .

David Scott of Atlanta for the Democrat nomination .
