Valeria never whistled . Nor did she approve of people who did . In sixty-eight years , what Valeria had learned to be a truth about character was that people who whistled were crass . Whistlers were untrustworthy and irresponsible . They were shiftless . They were common . Butchers whistled . Peasants also . When they were supposed to be tending to their fields or completing any number of tasks peasants are meant to complete , Valeria was certain she could find them instead with their chins wet from a half liter of beer , sitting in the village 's tavern , whistling at the slutty proprietress , and telling off-color jokes . <p> As for the butcher , he was the worst kind of whistler . He whistled right into his customers ' faces . Blew his fetid breath right into the nostrils of anyone who visited him . Certainly , a visit to the whistling butcher on Monday was a trip to the health clinic by midweek . <p> Valeria thought about it while scrubbing the grout of her portico floor early in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not whistle . The Hungarian president did not whistle either . She followed a line back through Soviet history : Trotsky may have whistled ; Lenin , certainly not ; Stalin only whistled in madness . Subsequent leaders of the Soviet regime never whistled , not even Gorbachev . Yeltsin ? Valeria 's stomach turned when she thought about Russia 's head of state . Yes , Yeltsin probably whistles , she decided . <p> And prior to the Communists , or reformed Communists , or whatever they called themselves these days , the aristocracy they had replaced had never whistled either . The Hapsburgs certainly never had . Valeria scoffed just imagining it . A whistling Hapsburg ! <p> She brushed away a stray leaf with the back of her hand . She remembered hearing the village 's mayor whistle and she swore . <p> True , it had only happened once , and in his defense , he did not know he was being spied upon . Still , Valeria was watching him . She did not like him . She did not approve of his flashy German car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nothing more than a cleverly trained chimpanzee , though more gauche and obtuse than any chimpanzee could possibly be . <p> Valeria sighed . The mayor was who he was , like everyone else of his generation . The young were all too gauche these days . Since the Soviets had exited Hungary-unceremoniously , she might add-the country had sidled up to the West like a cheap moll . In fact , self-respect seemed to have deteriorated . Adolescent men appeared from nowhere . They drove expensive cars and kept company with expensive , long-legged women , women who were useless in all capacities save sex , who lacked any apparatus that might make them useful to society 's betterment . They certainly were not revolutionaries , these women . What with their narrow hips and small breasts , these simple-minded , androgynous-looking sexpots could not even breed tomorrow 's revolutionaries . Valeria thought of the mayor 's bride giving birth and laughed . Ornaments ! That 's all the new woman was good for these days-decoration . Why , just imagine it , Valeria thought , allowing oneself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornaments when they are rushing to get to their sweets and presents . Just imagine it - allowing oneself to be set aside casually , or thrown to the ground violently , or shattered against a wall , or , at best , if they were very , very lucky , to be stuffed in a box until the next holiday season . Valeria shook her head . Imagine it ! A generation of women reared to turn off everything within them except the capacity for easy compliance to wet sex . <p> Valeria scrubbed more vigorously . Her face flushed . <p> Meanwhile , she thought , meanwhile , the mayor and his cronies slapped one another on their backs . They filled their bank accounts ... blew smoke at the citizenry ... had the nerve-the audacity , really-to call the whole stinking flea circus a democracy . Why , the Communists were philosopher kings when compared with the backslapping capitalists in charge of Hungary 's new and improved free-market system . <p> Valeria spat at a speck of white bird shit and scratched it with a short fingernail . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultimately , that was her problem with this new system . It bred contempt . The masses need the inviolable . Even Stalin knew that . The proper care and feeding of the masses requires and demands opiates ! But the capitalists ran roughshod over everything . They left nothing untouched or undefiled . Even the insignificant succumbed to market pressure . Things as inconsequential as her favorite Brazilian soap operas were being interrupted with screaming ads for French douches and toilet paper ! Why ? Who allowed that ? What was the point of it ? How did screaming commercials-decibels louder than the program itself , so loud she could n't escape them even when she went to the wash closet ( yes , she even heard them in there ) - how did screaming commercials ( four times during her last program ) make a democracy ? It made no sense ... <p> And then to top things off , the mayor was a whistler ! <p> Thank goodness , she thought to herself . Thank goodness they lived in a small village , deep in the steppes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this point . She could rest assured that even the mayor 's whistling , loud as it was , would fall on deaf ears . If the mayor-only the cleverest of peasants-wanted to whistle , it did not matter ; no one of importance would hear him and think less of the village . In fact , if , from afar , the queen of England or the Hungarian president happened to hear the mayor 's whistling as they were writing one another letters , they might look up for a moment and wonder , but then they would shrug and write the faint whistling off as wind stirring a distant crop of sugar beets ; the mayor 's tinny whistle would be as insignificant to their ears as leaves falling on forgotten hunting grounds-as insignificant a sound to their cochleas as the candelabra flickering in their studies . <p> Except lately , the mayor himself had started bringing foreigners in . As though he had intuited that he needed an audience . Investors , he called them . Hardly any outsiders had ever come through their village before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been alive . In fact , Valeria remembered watching German tanks as a young girl along with her friends as the machines sped along the horizon making their way to Russia . Then , later , on the horizon again , she watched as British tanks arrived . The phalanxes hammered one another for days . And still later on , as a teenager , she watched the horizon for three days as a parade of Russian tanks made their way to Budapest . None of the tanks ever turned in their village 's direction . They were always heading toward coordinates more valuable , toward more interesting or important places to occupy . While this should have been cause for great relief , to some it was almost an insult . Indeed , it damaged the psyche of the villagers so much , this sheer disinterest by the tanks-by anything really-that when the new expressway was built , the villagers insisted that the signs not mention their village at all . <p> " Reaching us is n't really worth anyone 's petrol , " some said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . " Tourists would be better off at Balaton . " <p> The Gypsies working on the road crew shrugged and offered the villagers the blue road-sign , which was quickly mounted in the village 's tavern . <p> Things change , however , and the mayor had his hand in all of it . Foreigners were visiting all the time now , it seemed . <p> Valeria looked at her handiwork and nodded . The blue tiles were clean . They sparkled . The grout was bone white . She moved her bucket to the concrete steps . A child had offered to paint them for her , but she had refused . Clean was good enough for her . She pulled her brush from the sudsy water and attacked them . She could n't help but think of the mayor , and she cursed again . <p> It was the people 's fault , what this village was becoming . After all , they had voted the mayor in . The people of her village had put him where he was . Her neighbors ! The most immoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of has-beens , alcoholics , pedophiles , perverts , unwed mothers , sissies , and Gypsies she had ever known . Her thoughts on this point were not exaggeration . She had lived in the village her entire life . She knew the village 's citizens intimately for what they were-a shiftless group of malcontents , maladroits to the last scruffy-necked man , overweight woman , and unclean child . And all of them smiting and nodding as they pulled the lever that put in power a man she would not have trusted with her trash . <p> She washed up . <p> Valeria did not consider herself a killjoy . Not in the least . In fact , she kept a ring of keys at her side , like a jailer , and sometimes she liked to shake them . When she felt pleased or content , instead of whistling or smiling she just tugged at the string around her hips until the dangling keys-nearly one hundred of them-started to shake . She felt this act to be supremely appropriate to a woman her age . It was fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it was still dark out . As she had for many years , she reached its entrance with her chin jutted forward and her eyes owlish just as the sun was peeking out . She clutched her basket ahead of her like a battering ram . She marched through the throng of shoppers and thought nothing of ramming her meaty elbows into the ribs of other women , or against the jaws of loud children , or against the backs of slow old men . If it meant she could save a few forints on the last of the tripe , or if it meant she might be able to purchase a fresh carp , so fresh that its tail still smacked against crushed ice , she would elbow her way through a crowd or ram them with her basket and then shout in her victims ' astonished faces to boot . <p> She ignored the mongers hawking junk on the sidewalks out front . She had no regard for Chinese boom boxes , Polish electronics , German cassettes , or aluminum pans . She ignored the counterfeit sneakers piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quickly as she could and head , instead , into the belly of the market , toward the stalls , where her neighbors displayed their fruits and vegetables . <p> Inside , she was like a raptor . She scanned the great hall , walked about , and investigated each and every cranny . The market was a place of commerce and Valeria acted accordingly . She allowed herself even fewer pleasantries while there . She haggled and harangued like a magnate and then bought little or nothing . <p> She jabbed her fingers into her neighbors ' stockpiles , poking and handling their orange carrots , white carrots , turnips , rutabagas , tomatoes , parsley , pears , and asparagus . Most of these foodstuffs Valeria grew herself . She had no reason to buy anything . She was merely inspecting , checking for quality . <p> Her neighbors shook their heads at her . It was the same scene every day . Some even shooed her away . <p> " Leave my food alone , " they said . " Why are you touching that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is always the people with the worst-looking vegetables who complain the most , " she answered . <p> When Valeria found something she did not like or that she felt should not have been sold , she looked up at the vendor , focused on the sheepish face staring back , and shook her head . <p> " You 're not selling this , are you ? " <p> The vendor turned red . Whether out of anger or embarrassment one could n't say . <p> Regardless , they all responded the same way . <p> " You 're crazy . Get away from my vegetables . " <p> " But you ca n't possibly mean to sell this ? " <p> " Why not ? Go away . " <p> " I would n't feed this to my pigs , " Valeria said . " You 'll poison somebody with this . " <p> A few shoppers would stop and listen . The vendor would shake her head and smile at them . <p> " Valeria , there is nothing wrong with my vegetables . I 've grown them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The vendor smiled . Her eyes were full of rage . <p> Valeria then sniffed the vegetable in question and shook her head . <p> " How old is this ? " <p> The vendor was speechless . <p> " Why does it smell like urine ? " <p> The vendor shrugged . <p> " Are you letting your cat pee on these ? You should be imprisoned , " Valeria said , and tugged at her keys . <p> She ruined sales . Villagers , though they did n't like Valeria , never questioned her knowledge . Every morning word traveled quickly through the market about who was selling rotten produce . <p> It was rare when Valeria found a fruit or vegetable grown better than one she could grow herself . In those instances , her eyes again focused on the vendor . Then she nodded her head in appreciation before asking , " Who are your parents ? " The vendor answered and Valeria nodded , trying to remember . Then she congratulated the vendor , bought the vegetable , took it home , and examined it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crossbreed them with her own near-perfect vegetables . <p> Valeria was just as knowledgeable about the fish and meats . In fact , no one in the market was safe from her . Even the women who sold spices made sure to hide their older bags of seasonings when Valeria was walking by . Since the country had opened up to the West , even in Zivatar , new fruits and vegetables had been introduced . In what was once a room of potato browns and spinach greens , colors like orange and red stood out like Christmas lights . In the first heady days of capitalism , when exotic fruits were still a novelty , people who hardly ever went shopping made special visits to the market just to look at pineapples . Valeria was n't interested in foreign fruits and vegetables , mostly because she could not grow them , but also because of their blatant sensuality . Tropical fruits were swollen with flesh and juice . They were sticky . They were uninhibited . The first time she held a banana , Valeria was offended . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market ? " she asked . <p> " It 's a banana , Valeria . You know that . Taste it . " <p> Valeria peeked at it and shook her head . <p> " I will not . It 's for monkeys . " <p> " It 's not . The mayor buys them all the time . It 's good . Here , just have a bite . " <p> Valeria tasted it . She had to admit that it was good . Still , tropical fruits disturbed her , and except for the occasional banana , she left them alone . Besides , they were ridiculously expensive . Only the young capitalists could afford them . Valeria noted that besides the mayor 's love of bananas , the mayor 's bride was always buying bags of oranges . Bags of them . Ostentatious is what it was . In the old days , families only shared an orange at Christmastime . One orange . It was a treat . Valeria was certain that for most families that was still the case . How long would it take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered ? And how could the mayor allow his wife to leave the house wearing more makeup than clothing ? A woman with a slippery mouth , long legs , and no hips to speak of , carrying an expensive bag of Valencia oranges ... what had the world become ? <p> Even American vegetables were suspect . Valeria examined the vegetables from America closely . The label on one crate read : CALIFORNIA RED PEPPERS . She bought one , just to see what an American pepper tasted like . She was n't impressed . The pepper looked nice enough , it was big and clean , without a mark on it , grown in a hothouse , no doubt ; but when she took it home and cooked it in a stew she was disappointed with its blandness-no tang at all , nothing but nitrogen . <p> Sometimes , when Valeria had an abundance of anything in her garden , she would arrive even earlier in the morning , set up a stall of her own , arrange her vegetables by color , and sell them at a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the villagers did n't like Valeria , when it came to the quality of her goods , they could not question her . Her fruits and vegetables were never too soft , never tasted like rot had just set in , and never , ever smelled like cat urine . <p> Valeria grew them on her two hectares of land . That was three hundred hectares less than what her grandfather had owned before the Communists took everything , but it was more than enough land to carry her through the winter and support her livestock . Everything else was profit . Valeria felt she could afford to be caustic . She often was caustic . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
