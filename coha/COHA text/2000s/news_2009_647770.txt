When they were nabbed by North Korean guards along China 's northeastern Tumen River border with North Korea , reporters Laura Ling and Euna Lee were filming for Al Gore ' s Current TV network on an especially sensitive topic : the flight of North Korean defectors from the horrors of starvation , disease , jailing , torture and beatings . <p> Now , detained by the regime whose brutality they were trying to report , their documentary work could make their case extremely problematic . When or whether North Korean authorities will want to release the two is far from clear . Their ordeal has become all the more politicized after a stunning series of events this month reversed several years of painstaking progress on getting the North to agree to denuclearization . <p> " North Korea is waiting for the maximum leverage , " says Tim Peters , a pastor whose organization , " Helping Hands Korea , " has worked for years with North Korean defectors here and in China along the Tumen River border . " They will put them on trial and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> For North Korea , the timing was ideal . North Korea test-fired a long-range Taepodong-2 missile on April 5 ; on April 14 , it said it was resuming its nuclear-weapons program and expelled inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency after the UN Security Council issued a statement condemning the launch . At the same time , North Korea said it would " never " again join six-party talks , under which it agreed in 2007 to disable and then dismantle all its nuclear facilities in return for a vast infusion of aid . <p> The fate of the two American female journalists , who are now prisoners in a " state guest house " near Pyongyang , may depend on whether the United States resumes negotiations with North Korea , possibly on a bilateral basis , as the North has long wanted , rather than in a multilateral format . <p> Complicating matters is that Ms. Ling 's sister , Lisa Ling , produced a hard-hitting expose called " Inside North Korea " for National Geographic three years ago . <p> More reason to take a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which Lisa Ling secretly shot film on a hidden camera while pretending to be on the team of an eye doctor from Nepal , will give North Korean authorities all the more reason to adopt a tough stance toward Ling and Lee . Lisa Ling pilloried North Korean leader Kim Jong Il as " a dictator , " remarking , " We 've started to get a sense of what it 's like to be trapped under the iron grip of Kim Jong Il . " <p> " This film would be considered embarrassing for the regime , " says Peters . " Part of the film showed people trying to leave . They did a reenactment . It definitely brought out the human rights issue . " <p> Kim Sang-hun , a former UN official who has been active for years on behalf of North Korean defectors , agrees North Korean outrage over the National Geographic report may complicate pleas for the women 's release . " North Korean authorities are not going to be happy about that documentary , " he says . " They may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does not believe , however , that the two are destined to remain in North Korea indefinitely . Their case differs from those of approximately 500 South Koreans , mostly fishermen picked up in North Korean territorial waters , as well as 20 or 30 Japanese who were kidnapped from Japanese soil in the late 1970s and early 1980s , and are believed still to be living in the North . <p> " The others held are all of a clandestine nature , " says Mr. Kim . " They do n't admit they are holding them , but this is something they do not hide . The US will make a big issue . " Eventually , he predicts , " they will go on trial " - and possibly get lengthy prison sentences to be reduced in negotiations . <p> " Maybe North Korea should show a goodwill gesture , " he says , " but that 's not going to happen right away . " <p> In the meantime , looking ahead to freeing them eventually , North Korean authorities are believed not be treating them badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly inevitable , torture is frequent , and executions routine for those suspected of espionage or disloyalty . <p> Swedish diplomats , acting on behalf of the US , which does not have relations with North Korea , have visited the two near Pyongyang . Current TV , based in San Francisco , also has an avenue of influence through Al Gore , half-owner of the network . Mr. Gore is believed to have communicated directly with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , whom he knows well from their eight years in the White House- she as first lady , he as vice president . <p> The mystery of their capture <p> Their case is still more complicated , however , by the mystery of how they were captured . <p> One theory is that the women 's guide , a Chinese citizen of Korean ancestry and a member of the large ethnic Korean community in northeastern China who was able to go in and out of North Korea without a visa , could have set them up . <p> It 's still not clear if the two had crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow river , covered with ice at the time , or if North Korean police dashed onto the Chinese side and grabbed them . North Koreans regularly cross the river , not necessarily to defect , but to look for food and other goods in short supply at home . They then return , often after paying off border guards . <p> Kim , the former UN official , says the guide was arrested in North Korea earlier for aiding defectors , was held for six months and then sent back to China . <p> People caught up in such circumstances , he says , " are normally released on the condition of working for them with foreign journalists , " that is , to inform the North Koreans what they are doing and whom they are seeing . <p> The fear of betraying contacts , defectors - and the families they left behind in North Korea - haunts Durihana , a Seoul-based organization whose pastor , Rev. Chun Ki-won , was imprisoned for ten months in China some years ago for assisting defectors fleeing through China toward sanctuary in Mongolia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave them contact names , and advised them of the risks of going too close to the line with North Korea . <p> " They did n't cover the faces of the North Koreans they interviewed , " says Choi Song-jun , a Bible student who works for Durihana . " We really worry about it . We pray for them and for their relatives . Nobody knows what happens to them . " <p> As for what happened to the Korean-Chinese guide , reports vary . He was initially reported to have been picked up by the North Koreans , then to have been held in China . He is now believed to be in Pyongyang . <p> One who should know more is Current TV cameraman Mitch Koss , who escaped when Ling and Lee were picked up . He left China after having been held by Chinese police but has avoided publicity amid efforts to get North Korea to release the two . <p> However they were captured , analysts say North Korean authorities will see a chance for advantage in a high-stakes diplomatic game and also for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young ladies will be thrown into the bargain to see if they can extract some more , " says Peters . " That 's standard operating procedure for the North Koreans , to milk it for all they can . They recognize these girls as tools in the bargaining . " <p> All that 's to be expected , say activists here , from a system that Lisa Ling describes as " completely controlled by Kim Jong Il , " where " finally it hit me - there may not be a difference between true belief and true fear . " The question Peters and Kim ask is whether that 's also " hit " Laura Ling and Euna Lee as they languish under guard , and interrogation , in a guest house near Pyongyang . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2009 .
