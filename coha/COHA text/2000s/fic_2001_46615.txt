THE GIRL WAS YOUNG when she did it , and she did n't live there . This was in 1962 . She was eighteen . She 'd been hired to tidy the place . It was three , maybe four years before anybody noticed . The letters were so small , and they always ate in the kitchen . And when they did discover them she was already gone to Halifax . By that time the girl had a reputation to escape from . So when they put two and two together and figured out it was she who did it , they were n't surprised . Of course she 'd be the one to do something like this , they said  --  shameless girl , not shocking at all . <p> A cod fisherman , a captain , lived with his wife in the house , one of the original Locke mansions on Gurden Street , overlooking the harbor . They never had children , but dust collects nonetheless in a house so huge . The girl had never been in a place that grand . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her letters . RGL . That she 'd wanted to leave her mark in the world , something that would last , something that would stay . Her family still lived in town ( father and brothers sold hardware ) , so they could have held somebody accountable for the damage if they 'd wanted to . But the captain and his wife talked it over and decided not to mention the initials to anyone . Not that they approved  --  Lord , no . It was defacement of property . Vandalism . Of course it was an heirloom ; it had belonged to her mother 's mother , a burnished mahogany drop-leaf built in York in 1844 . They could never approve . But they were quiet people ; they kept to themselves in the hard times , and even in good times held their distance . Besides , what could anybody do about it now ? What was done was done . Still , that did n't mean the captain 's wife did n't watch more carefully over the other girls who came to clean , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sugar breath , that morning , the one out of a thousand when he was home and slept late  --  he 'd startled her in the kitchen . Captain Adelbert ! I did n't have any idea you were home , me banging the pots down here to wake the dead . His only intention was to touch her sweater ( Lucy was out , still teaching school then ) , but he could n't stop and kissed her , her hands at her sides . She did n't resist or desire , and that had made him a fool for years . <p> Yet over the longer years  --  when the fish became scarcer , when they 'd long since failed their vow to fill that house with children , when the silences between them sometimes lasted hours , when the captain 's wife no longer paced the house , waiting for him , or word of him  --  an odd thing . They still talked about the letters . RGL became a part of the table that had always been too good to eat on , as important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs . She . The simple fact of her once among them , among their things , dusting , opening closet doors , tracing a finger along the frames of the paintings in the front room . Taking a needle-she must have used a needle  --  and climbing up on the table , walking on her knees to a spot just off the center . <p> In the dark , now older , retired , still in the house , they murmur : <p> " She was a pretty girl , was n't she ? " <p> " Curls . Yes , yes . Got in trouble with the boys early on , did n't she ? " <p> " What do you think the G stands for ? " <p> " Gina ? Gertrude ? " <p> " Georgette ? " <p> " Never came back here ever . " <p> " No , never heard of it . Family acts like she never existed . " <p> " Well . She was a disgrace , I suppose . " <p> " Yes , well . " <p> They both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain coughs and twists . Age and too much land have made him restless , a man who was never restless , who slept the unmovable sleep of beached whales , now tossing and muttering , waking with sweat-wet hands , afraid . Now he dreams of drowning . And the captain 's wife stares at the ceiling in the dark and thinks of leading a child , Rachel Larsh 's child , an angry boy in new leather shoes , through the house , pointing out the captain 's trophies , the swordfish he caught during that trip to the Pacific ( on the wall in the den ) , the hidden staircase behind the summer kitchen , and here , see , look , beneath the vase he brought back from St. John , your mother 's initials . And the boy not curious , shaking free his hand . <p> Author Affiliation
