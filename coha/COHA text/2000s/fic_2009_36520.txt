3 MARIS 1811 p. d. 6749 f. e . <p> The man in the drab pale blue Federation shipsuit sat inside the oblong cubicle just large enough for the chair and hood that provided direct sensory- reinforced information  --  useful for everything from maintenance data to in- depth intelligence briefings . After thirty standard minutes , he removed the hood , rose to his feet , pushed back the screen as he stepped out onto the dark blue of the third deck . The bulkheads were an eye- resting blue , close to the shade of his shipsuit , and devoid of any decoration or projections . That was true of all bulkheads on the WuDing , and of all Federation deep- space vessels . He eyed the three datastations for a moment , now all empty , then shook his head . <p> He stood 193 centimeters and massed 104.4 kilograms , and under the ship 's single grav , mass and weight matched . His hair was nondescript brown . His eyes were silver gray . <p> He frowned for a moment , still trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his nostrils . The odor was a side effect of the suspension cradles in which he and much of the Wu - Ding 's crew had spent the transit out from Fronera , and it would pass . It certainly had on his missions to Khriastos and Marduk . He just wished the odor had already departed . He remained motionless , trying to organize the mass of information he had been men11 tally force- fed . <p> ITEM : The planet was too close to the K7 orange- tinted sun to be habitable under normal conditions , although the system was older by at least a billion years than the Sol system . <p> ITEM : The planet had a mass of 1.07 T-norm , with an upper atmosphere that suggested optimal habitability . <p> ITEM : : The planet itself was impenetrable to all forms of Federation scanning and detection technology . <p> ITEM : The planet presented an image of featureless silver gray haze to normal human vision and remained equally feature less to all forms of observation technology . <p> ITEM : It had no moons or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Identical objects massing approximately .11 kilograms orbited the planet in at least three differing levels . The number of such objects in each orbital sphere could not be quantified , but estimates suggested more than two million per sphere . <p> ITEM:The planet radiated nothing along any known spectrum . No electromagnetic radiation , no gravitonic waves , no nothing . . . except a certain amount of evenly dispersed heat and radiation consisting of energy reflected from the planet 's sun . <p> ITEM : He had to find out what lay below that silver gray haze . <p> He nodded slowly , then stretched . He disliked info- feed briefings . He always had . He turned and began to walk toward the WuDing 's Operations Control . His shipboots were silent on the plastiform deck . <p> Major Roget , to OpCon . <p> Stet . On my way . <p> There was no response . The colonel disliked unnecessary communications , particularly on the shipnet , and particularly when he had to deal with an FSA agent transferred into his command at the rank of major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and captains , though he 'd known none of them before boarding the WuDing . <p> An Ops monitor tech , also in a pale blue shipsuit , hurried in Roget 's direction . As she neared him , her eyes took in his collar insignia , and she averted her eyes , just enough to display the proper respect . <p> Roget inclined his head fractionally in response and continued to the first ladder , which he ascended . Two levels up , he headed aft . <p> The hatch to Colonel Tian 's office irised open at Roget 's approach and closed behind him . Roget took two steps into a space four times the size of the briefing cubicle and halted . The office held two chairs . The colonel sat in one . <p> " Sir , " offered Roget . <p> " Please be seated , Major . " The colonel gestured for Roget to take the other chair . The thin operations console was folded flush against the aft bulkhead . Hard- connected systems worked far better in battle than broadband links , although no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries . <p> Roget sat down and waited . <p> The colonel steepled his fingers , his eyes looking not at Roget , but through the major . He was a good half a head shorter than Roget , but slender , almost willowy despite his age , and his black eyes were youthfully ancient . Finally , he spoke . " According to the report forwarded by FSA , you are most capable , Major , especially when acting alone . Your accomplishments on Marduk and on system station Khriastos appear particularly noteworthy . " Tian paused . " In de pen dent action , in par tic u lar , may be needed on this assignment , and that is why the FIS requested assistance from FSA . " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " What do you think lies behind that haze- shield , Major ? " <p> " An alien culture . Probably Thomist , but that would be speculation , sir . " <p> " You consider the Thomists as aliens ? " The colonel 's tone suggested raised eyebrows , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aims of the Federation , certainly . " <p> " How would you define alien ? " <p> " Not aligned and unfathomable , " replied Roget easily . He 'd reported to more than enough hard- eyed and unnamed FSA colonels over the years that an FIS colonel was hardly anything to worry about . <p> " Unfathomable ? " <p> " Theoretically intellectually understandable , but not emotionally comprehensible . " <p> The colonel offered the slightest nod . " Analytics calculate the probability at 73 percent for the likelihood of a Thomist world . " <p> Again , Roget waited . Even for a Federation Interstellar Ser vice security officer , the colonel was being casual , if not blasT , about the discovery of a human splinter culture or an alien world . Unlike Roget , he had to have known of the world long before Roget 's briefing . <p> " Do you have any questions ? " <p> " How long have we known about this world ? " Roget asked the question because it was expected , not because he anticipated a meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've known about the possibility for quite a time . " <p> " How long might that be , sir ? " <p> " Long enough . We 're not absolutely certain it is a Thomist world . That 's your task . You will , of course , wear a pressure suit until you confirm that the world is not environmentally hostile , and your dropboat is configured with some additional survival features to deal with that eventuality , although the scientists believe such is unlikely . " <p> The colonel 's response confirmed Roget 's feelings . The senior officer was n't about to answer the questions Roget would have liked to ask , and the ones he would answer had already been addressed by the console briefing . The issue of a hostile environment had also been touched upon and dismissed , as if the colonel knew far more than he was revealing . <p> " Any other questions ? " <p> " No , sir . " <p> " Your outward complacency exemplifies your inner arrogance , Major . " <p> " Yes , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of failed Noram supremacy . " Tian 's short laugh was humorless . <p> " As opposed to inscrutability behind inscrutability , sir ? " <p> " There is a difference between inscrutability and deception , Major . It 's called honesty , I believe . " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " If you 're successful , Major , you 'll doubtless end up in a position similar to mine , if within the Federation Security Agency . " <p> That was a large " if , " Roget knew . So did the colonel . <p> The senior officer looked at Roget . " You wo n't like the entry . " <p> " You do n't expect most of us to survive it . " Roget 's silver gray eyes never left the colonel 's face . <p> " We do hope you will . We 'd rather not lose the investment , and we 'd like some confirmation of what lies beneath that haze . The dropboat and your suit are designed to handle everything engineering could anticipate . " <p> That did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough high tech that they 'd only been rediscovered  --  if the planet called Haze was indeed theirs  --  by accident more than a millennium later . But if what lay beneath that silvery shifting shield happened to be nonhuman alien , then matters would either be far better . . . or far , far , worse . <p> He was n't certain whether he would rather face the Thomists or nonhuman aliens . <p> " That is all , Major . " The colonel 's smile was cool . He did not stand . <p> " Yes , sir . " Roget stood , smiled politely , turned , and walked from the small office . <p> He could n't help but wonder what surprises this mission held . In one way or another , every mission had provided something he had n't anticipated , and often had revealed matters that even the FSA had not expected . Not that he had ever revealed all of those . <p> Excerpted from Haze by L.E . Modesitt , Jr . <br> Copyright 2009 by L.E . Modesitt , Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
