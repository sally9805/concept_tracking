<p> On Wednesday , the public 's gaze and the media 's glare will focus on an unlikely target : architecture . <p> Gathered in a mammoth room across from the empty 16 acres where the World Trade Center 's twin towers once stood , seven teams that include some of the world 's most celebrated architects will unveil their ideas on how to repair the physical scar . The audience will include more than 200 reporters . The four-hour presentation will be televised live in New York . <p> If the images capture people 's imagination , they 'll bring needed energy to the stumbling efforts to resurrect lower Manhattan . They 'll revive something else  --  the notion that architects have a central role to play in the debate over how America should grow . <p> " Perhaps not since the United Nations competition has there been such attention placed on internationally prominent architects , " said Robert Ivy , editor in chief of Architectural Record magazine . " This is our chance for transformational thinking , not architecture as commodity . " <p> Wednesday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctioned proposals was unveiled with fanfare and then condemned as lifeless  --  not just by architecture critics but by laypeople . Now , the single planning firm behind those proposals has been replaced by seven teams with design styles running the gamut from elegant lines to amorphous blobs . <p> That variety was sought out by the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. , the governmental body created to oversee the site where a terrorist attack killed 2,819 people and felled two towers that in many ways symbolized New York . But it leaves open the chance that some images will seem indulgent , even callous  --  art for art 's sake by designers more interested in the cutting edge than real life . <p> " It 's an extraordinary opportunity for architecture , but the challenge is enormous , " said Bernard Tschumi , dean of the school of architecture at Columbia University . " There 's the risk of total irrelevance . " <p> CONFUSION ON GOALS , LEADERSHIP <p> What makes the task difficult is that there 's no consensus on what the site should become . Nor is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development Corp . or the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , the landowner . <p> " Typically , clients tell needs and wishes in an articulate manner , " said Tschumi , who was one of the runners-up in the competition . " The role is to translate need , as if you are projecting society onto the ground . At the World Trade Center , we see the process totally topsy-turvy . They 're turning to architects and saying , ' Tell us what we should do . ' " <p> That 's what has some onlookers nervous . <p> After all , the last time major architects influenced American cities was in the spread of modern architecture , a style personified by the U.N . building 's boxy slabs . The eventual result was a backlash that still makes skeptics view " starchitects " with distrust . <p> " I 'd rather be optimistic than not , but until we see the proposals , who knows ? " said Steve Cuozzo , a New York Post columnist who has followed the bumpy rebuilding process . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing you are bound to certain guidelines . It 's another to say , ' This is what I 've always wanted to do , two curlicues of linguine reaching to the sky . ' " <p> Nothing will be shown the public before Wednesday 's press conference . But a small committee of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp . headed by staff planner Alexander Garvin has held three review sessions with each team , urging them to stay at least somewhat grounded . <p> Garvin stressed last week that architects were given a 16-page program spelling out specific needs , such as transit connections and careful framing of space for a future memorial . He also said " an overwhelming majority of the schemes approach the landscape in a serious way . " <p> Note the hedge . <p> " No , I will not say I have all serious approaches , " Garvin conceded . " Some are more practical than others . Some are better than others . . . . One or two are more abstract than others . " <p> Considering the architects involved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AS THEIR FIELD <p> Culled from 407 entrants , the seven finalists are a microcosm of the architectural world in 2002 : a fractured community with starkly different views as to the role of design in modern society . <p> If one end of the spectrum is the team assembled by the New York office of Skidmore , Owings and Merrill  --  a firm best known for sleek office towers and large-scale civic projects  --  the other is a team that includes Foreign Office Architects , lauded for a ferry terminal in Yokohama , Japan , that eschews right angles , and Greg Lynn of Los Angeles , who expounds the virtues of computer-generated " blob " architecture . <p> As tragic as the attacks of Sept. 11 were , " the disaster has allowed people to think progressively and reflect on how we might live , " said Joseph Rosa , curator of architecture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art . " I like that the teams are so different . . . . The entries will reflect a point of time , even if they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the goal of the Port Authority and the Lower Manhattan Development Corp . is to hammer out a master plan by Jan. 31 . Officials might rely on a single team , or they might have different teams focus on different aspects of the concept . <p> One thing is certain : Scrutiny will continue . <p> " It 's extraordinarily unusual that so many people care about an architectural event like this , " said Carol Willis , founder of the Skyscraper Museum in New York . <p> At the same time , she cautioned that the starting point was n't a renewed interest in design theory . It 's the searing importance of what happened on Sept. 11 . <p> " The level of interest is enormous , but that 's because everyone personalized the attack , " Willis said . " They want to see a resolution . " <p> 7 teams to present visions for future of World Trade Center site <p> In September , the Lower Manhattan Development Corp . selected six teams to produce design ideas for the World Trade Center site . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everybody in the world . " Those ideas will be unveiled Wednesday in the Winter Garden of Battery Park City . The teams , including one on board before September : . <p> The teams include Skidmore , Owings and Merrill , whose design for World Trade Center 7 , left , was announced recently , and Norman Foster and Partners , designers of a tower in London , right . <p>  --  Studio Daniel Libeskind of Germany , best known for the Jewish Museum in Berlin . Libeskind also designed a proposed home for the Jewish Museum San Francisco . <p>  --  Norman Foster and Partners of England . Lord Foster 's projects include the remodeled Reichstag in Berlin and a 40-story rounded tower in London nicknamed the " erotic gherkin . " <p>  --  Richard Meier , Peter Eisenman , Charles Gwathmey and Steven Holl are New York architects who rose to prominence in the 1970s . Meier 's Getty museum in Los Angeles was one of the most publicized buildings of the ' 90s . Eisenman is well known within the profession as a provocateur , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Architects is a collaboration of international designers . Greg Lynn of Los Angeles is part of this team . In a proposal included in a recent New York art exhibit , he imagined two thin towers that looked as if they were sheathed in armor . <p>  --  Skidmore , Owings and Merrill of New York assembled a team with young designers from several fields , including landscape architect Tom Leader of Berkeley , the lone Bay Area participant . <p>  --  Think is a team that includes several well-regarded New York architects including Rafael Vinoly and Frederic Schwartz , designer of the new terminal for the Staten Island Ferry . <p>  --  Peterson Littenberg is a small New York firm that was already consulting for Lower Manhattan Development Corp . before September .
