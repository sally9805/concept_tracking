Section : Health &; Medicine Best Health Plans Grading a health plan 's successes and failures <p> Picking the right health plan is like looking at houses whose windows are blackened and whose doors lack knobs : You ca n't tell what they 're like inside . Yet this is open season , the time of year when millions of Americans must choose their health coverage for the next 12 months-usually with little idea of the quality of the plan they select . <p> So U.S. News and the National Committee for Quality Assurance , the primary accrediting organization for managed-care plans , have teamed up for the second straight year to clean windows and install doorknobs . This year 's rankings of commercial , Medicare , and Medicaid health maintenance organizations and point-of-service plans show useful , important information , such as how well a plan screens its members for colorectal cancer , about most of the nation 's large plans and the majority of smaller ones . Available data are presented for plans that did n't provide enough information to NCQA to be rankable . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that refused to make their information public ( story , Page 78 ) . <p> Yardsticks . NCQA examined 684 plans altogether , 54 more than last year . The top 50 commercial plans , top 25 Medicare plans , and top 25 Medicaid plans are ranked on the next two pages . The full set of rankings , plan-by-plan details , and the ability to compare plans are available at **26;2867;TOOLONG . <p> NCQA expanded the kinds of health-related information requested from plans this year . New Medicare yardsticks include the plan 's rate of flu shots and glaucoma screenings . Continuation of beta blocker drugs after a heart attack , known to improve survival , was added to the evaluation of commercial and Medicare plans . <p> But service is also important . So another measure was added for all plans : the percentage of members who said their plan did n't put them on hold forever and otherwise gave good service . That kept their blood pressure low , too-a free health benefit . What the Terms Mean <p> RANK Plans are ranked by score , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , the top 25 Medicare plans , and the top 25 Medicaid plans are ranked separately . <p> SCORE The score summarizes plan performance in four major areas-access to care , overall member satisfaction , prevention , and treatment . Many measures are weighed : 42 for commercial plans , 33 for Medicare plans , and 39 for Medicaid plans . The highest possible score is 100 , which includes up to 15 points based on compliance with accreditation standards set by the National Committee for Quality Assurance . All plans on the following pages are accredited . <p> STATE Where the plan operates . <p> TYPE Health maintenance organizations and point-of-service plans are ranked . In an HMO , a primary-care physician provides routine care and makes referrals to a network of specialists . Members pay out of pocket for care received outside the network .
