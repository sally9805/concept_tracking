Since he began playing soccer in Redlands , Calif. , in 1987 , Landon Donovan has loved taking the field at night . " Day games are less exciting  --  people come to them thinking about what they 'll be doing afterward , " the 18-year-old striker says , " but night games are events , like concerts . I always get pumped up to play them . " The days have been long and hard for Donovan since February ' 99 when he signed a four-year , $400,000 contract with Bayer Leverkusen , the premier club in Germany 's Bundesliga . Leverkusen assigned him to its developmental regionalliga squad , which plays in small stadiums in the hinterlands . Under constant pressure to perform , targeted because of his big salary , 9,000 miles from home , the kid who might become the U.S. 's first great goal scorer had struggled . // Last month , however , Donovan finally found his footing . Fittingly , the breakthrough came at night , in a midweek regionalliga match against Essen . Though it was a home game for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cologne ; Leverkusen 's field lacks the facilities to contain Essen 's supporters , the rabid Red Bulls , who must be tunneled into an enclosure to prevent violence . Twenty-five minutes into the game Donovan shunted his defender aside , stretched out a leg and tapped a teammate 's weak shot home . Three minutes later , on a two-on-one breakaway , he volleyed a pass into the corner of the net from 15 yards out . Then , with a minute left in the first half , Donovan scored his third goal , drilling in a loose ball from near the top of the penalty box to give Bayer a 5-1 lead ; they won 5-2 . " Some games you can do no wrong , " Donovan says . " I just kept shooting . " In the papers the next day soccer writers compared Donovan to Leverkusen 's famed scorer Ulf Kristen , the Bundesliga 's Pel ? . // Donovan describes the Essen game as a " coming of age , " one that validated his decision to leave home and endure the hardships of adjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was shuttling between Leverkusen and various international tournaments to play for the U.S. under-17 team . But those hassles had their rewards . In November , Donovan received the Golden Ball , given to the outstanding player at the under-17 world championship in New Zealand , capping a youth career that included 35 goals and 16 assists in 41 international games . // A chasm yawns , however , between being the world 's best 17-year-old striker and just holding your own against veteran professionals . When most Americans mink of soccer goals , they imagine a striker breaking from the pack and tricking the goalie with deft footwork . But most scores occur in deep traffic , and the striker 's art involves meeting a ball that flies in at an acute angle , often with absurd spin , and instantly deflecting it toward the goal on a line that neither the goalie nor any other defender can intersect . Usually there 's a defender 's hip , shoulder or elbow complicating the execution of this magic trick ; sometimes it 's all three . The feat is akin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a seesaw . // Donovan has the gift to pull off such minor miracles . He rose rapidly through Southern California 's youth soccer system . At 17 he was not only playing for the U.S. under-23 team but also scoring regularly . He returned to the U.S. on Sunday to play with the under-23 team in an Olympic qualifying tournament . " We 've never had such a highly touted young attacking player , " says Bruce Arena , coach of the national team . " A lot of people are saying Landon 's the savior of American soccer , and I 'd love to say he 's the real thing , the answer to our problems . But there 's no direct correlation between success in the under-17s and at the senior level . Plus , I think all those expectations can be a huge burden . " // The questions about Donovan involve only the sport 's intangibles . In speed and agility tests he eclipses elite players years older than he is , and his ball handling technique is world-class . But world-class soccer is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing from clubs in England and Germany . " We seldom offer a young foreign player such a contract , " says Michael Reschke of Bayer Leverkusen , " but in 21 years working with young players , I 've rarely seen such strong potential . " // The time in Germany has transformed Donovan 's game . The 5 ' 8 " , 145-pound striker rarely touches the ball without getting bodychecked by his taller , heavier markers , and he has become noticeably more physical . On defense he charges at the goalkeeper or ball handler , forcing him to make a move . Donovan has learned to dribble with his elbows out , jabbing opponents as he sprints forward . " I definitely played horribly at first , " Donovan recalls . " I just could n't understand why my game was not working . There 's no creativity or flair in the game here . People kept telling me I have to battle  --  that 's the German theme in life . Finally , I quit playing like a sissy and decided to fight and run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Landon has a great heart , " by which Hermann means the combination of courage and resilience so prized in Germany . Coaches gauge it in youngsters by submitting them to harsh conditions and two-a-day practices , pushing potential stars to prove themselves against rough-hewn veterans . Donovan 's recent successes have confirmed Leverkusen management 's belief in his potential . Next year he will move up to the first team , a progression that was not expected so soon . But promotion to the first team does not ensure playing time : Leverkusen 's Bundesliga team is 35 deep , enough to fill two game-day rosters . // Though Leverkusen has high expectations for Donovan , he hardly gets preferential treatment . Shortly after his November exploits in New Zealand he bounced onto the team bus and sat near the front . Suddenly Hermann was looming above him , pointing to the top of Donovan 's thin cotton warmup suit . Loudly , the coach demanded , " What are you wearing underneath ? " Nothing , it turned out , except for a thin gold necklace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hermann forced his young striker to strip off his top and put on a thick sweatshirt . Pouting , Donovan muttered , " Man , I just got back here , and I 'm already getting yelled at . " // Hermann , a member of the first Leverkusen team to fight its way up into the Bundesliga , in 1979 , treats his work as seriously as a surgeon . " Your body is your capital , and you have to do everything for it , " he says . " That 's why I told Landon that he has to wear an undershirt when it 's cold . You must say , ' For 10 years I will do everything for football . ' You must train hard , you have to eat the right foods , you have to watch games to learn tactics . You must only go to the disco when you are on holiday . You must blow-dry your hair so it is n't wet when you go outside . " // Within Leverkusen 's soccer combine , people characterize the sport as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word ASPIRIN printed across their chests , in homage to the parent company 's best-known product . Players are awarded bonuses for games started , goals scored and wins ; fines are levied for even minor infractions . Few players on the regionalliga team have lucrative contracts like Donovan 's , so those extra payouts matter . The competition for starting slots often rages so intensely that practice injuries are commonplace . With mantralike similarity the Leverkusen bosses point out that Donovan is competing against grown men with families to feed . Donovan 's getting the same message from his father . " I always try to drill into him that it 's not a club team anymore , " Tim Donovan says . " Everyone 's playing for money , and he 's trying to take away someone 's job . Landon says , ' I know , I know , ' but I think it was hard for a 17-year-old to grasp . " // Like Landon , fellow Leverkusen regionalliga player John Thorrington left the States at 17 , but at first he played for the reserve team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't so many rules , " says Thorrington , now 20 , who transferred to Leverkusen last year . " We were one big club , training together , and the practices were less intense . Afterward the younger players had to clean the first team 's shoes . And if the older players thought you were out of line , they 'd drag you into the steam baths and hold a ' court case ' to punish you . " Such high jinks and camaraderie are unimaginable in Germany , where soccer clubs have the hierarchy and stiff professionalism of a Big Five accounting firm . // When Leverkusen made an offer to Donovan , his father pushed him to accept it . " Landon had a chance to do exactly what I had hoped to do , " recalls Tim Donovan , a former semipro hockey player who works for a pharmaceutical company in Nebraska , " but I did n't have the ability or the talent . " Not that Landon needed much encouragement . He had wanted to play in Europe since he was 13 . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hoped he would go to college  --  he earned a high school GED , having missed most of his junior year to play with the under-17 team  --  and she worried about his leaving home so young . // By the standards of the soccer world Landon 's age was no big deal . On his regionalliga team , goalkeeper Romuald Peiser came from Paris at 15 , and dozens of young Africans play for Italian teams every season . Even after Leverkusen offered enough upfront money to establish Landon 's college fund , Kenney-Cash had her doubts . There were heated arguments at the dinner table . Finally Landon 's parents , who divorced when he was two years old , agreed to let him go and to visit him for stretches as he settled in . Today Donovan says his mom still wants him Stateside . " It 's hard on me and on his twin sister , Tristan , " Kenney-Cash says , " and I worry he 'll start to see soccer only as a business . I still hope one day he does n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go . ' " // Donovan talks about having a life beyond soccer , but the sport dominates his time . He goes out rarely and then only to a movie or restaurant . He avoids all risk off the field . " I do n't want to put myself in a bad situation , " he says . " What happens if I drink a beer and become an alcoholic ? What if I try something else , and I like it ? I 'm not here to make friends . I 'm here to play professional soccer . " // Despite his recent success , living in Germany remains hard for Donovan . The language barrier walls him off from much of daily life ; his main friend in Germany is Thorrington , a fellow Californian . But separation from his family has been the most difficult , especially the distance from Tristan , who is a high school senior . " She 's everything to me , " he says . " We talk two or three times a week on the phone , but I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . When I go back to California , we do n't hang out as much as possible , just because we get too attached . It makes it so much harder when I leave . " Says Tristan , " It 's like missing a part of yourself . " His phone bills are in the high triple digits . // Emotionally it would have been far easier for Donovan to play for a team in Major League Soccer , but both he and Thorrington describe bypassing MLS as a no-brainer . The U.S. league is a fledgling business in a marginal sport ; the Bundesliga is the central focus of an entire country 's sporting passion . " Here we get 8,000 people watching third-division games , " says Thorrington. // Nevertheless , Donovan still struggles to get settled in Germany . Less than a week after his hat trick against Essen he told Hermann he felt worn-out and homesick . The team had a bye weekend coming up , and other players were planning visits home . Leverkusen shelled out for a plane ticket , and the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than just expatriate blues at play here . The strain Donovan is under is enormous , especially for a kid whose lifelong friends are giddily preparing for prom night . " I wanted to chill out and see my family , " Donovan says . " I wanted to spend time just doing whatever I wanted , not having a schedule . There have been times in Germany , like when I was n't playing , that I wanted to go home the next day . But when I 'm playing well , I ca n't imagine why I would ever leave . "
