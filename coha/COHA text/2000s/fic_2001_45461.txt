Adam 's way . Adam 's path . <p> Adam was small . Hardly a gnat . Adam was dark . Adam was fat . A fat crawly . <p> What Adam was n't was smart . <p> Pangs at that ?

Finally , I can say that . I can say it right . What a thrill ! And what a climb ! Again I cry thanks ( and always will ) . <p> What can I say in a way that brings insight , that sails in air , that sings ? I 'll start with my past : simply said , I was a lab animal . A lab animal in a trial . This trial was a stab at attaining a paradigm shift . A stab at faith . My brain was small . ( Was it , in fact , a brain at all ? ) My mind was dim . ( " Dim " hardly says what it was . ) In a big way , I was insignificant . <p> Pair that against what I am this day . I 'm a man . Part man , anyway . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny animal , a thing that can fit in a vial , a jar . A lady that I talk with calls this thing that I am rhabditis . I say I 'm Adam . <p> - Is that a fact ? says this lady . I say I think it is . <p> - Adam was a man with a thirst . <p> - What kind ? I ask . <p> -A mighty thirst , lacking limit . <p> - This was a flaw ? <p> -A flaw and a gift . Filling his mind was Adam 's wish . His primary aim . It was , in fact , a craving . <p> - Filling it with what ? <p> - Facts . Data . Carnal acts . Light . Filling it with anything . With all things . <p> -I want that . <p> This lady 's mind , as rapid as rain , trills happily . -I 'm glad . That was my wish in this . My plan . <p> First things first . ( That 's a maxim , is n't it ? ) A brain has many strata , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many trails , trails with winding paths that split and split again , that climb and fall and zigzag , paths that sandwich paths . A brain is this at birth . <p> And this : it 's whitish and grayish , springy and firm . It 's impartial . It 's galvanic . It 's as big as a ham . <p> A brain is a thing . A mind is distinct . It 's dainty and whimsical and killingly vast . By night it sings , by day it fills with will and travail . A mind is mighty . A mind is frail . It 's a liar . It 's a blizzard . Galactical , impractical , a mind inhabits air . <p> That is what I think . I 'm an infant , and my mind is n't rich . My brain is hardly half a brain . I 'm a half-wit . Half a half-wit . Mainly what I am is instinct . <p> What is instinct ? That I can say . Instinct is habit . It 's a straight path . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inward hand , a timing that is strict . It can spring as fast as whimsy , and it can wait . <p> Instinct is n't always civil . It is n't always fair and kind . <p> Is that bad ? I ca n't say . Wizards did my brain . It 's still in planning . Still changing . Ask a wizard what is fair and kind , what is right . Ask that lady . <p> Talk is anarchy . Talk is bliss . Talk says what is and is n't . Talk is king . That lady wants daily highlights . A diary , as taxing as it is . All right . I 'll start with this : a list that says what I am . <p> I 'm an amalgam with many parts and traits . Small brain . Dark skin . Thin as a hair . If hit by a bright light , I spasm and thrash . If bit by an icy chill , paralysis kicks in , and in an instant , I 'm still as a stick .

A magic trick , a daft and wayward wish , a triviality , a fad . <p> That 's appalling , and it is n't a fact . I 'm as wayward as anything atypical . I 'm as trivial as anything distinct . <p> What I am is an inkling , a twinkling , a light . I 'm an ant climbing stairs , a man gazing starward . I 'm a dwarf . I 'm a giant . I 'm basic and raw . <p> This is a birth , and fittingly , it 's a hard and a happy affair . Plainly , I 'm an infant . Can I fail ? I can . Will I ? Hah ! This is my dawn . <p> I 'm a worm .

What bawdy clowns of oration ! Or shall I ask what silly fogs , what airs my brain is giving off ? <p> I do n't mind . I know that I 'm not with it . Not totally . I 'm a goofball notion , a taxonomic knot . Did I say an ontologic cryptogram ? That , too . And , according to that lady , a work of art . <p> My mind is coming fast now . My brain is growing . Row on row of axons , rooting , dividing , branching into pathways , coiling into labyrinths , forging forward as if to lock tomorrow in its spot . <p> I 'm shaking , tingling , giddy with anticipation . I 'm on a cliff , a brink , I 'm blasting off . This world as I know it is a shadow of what awaits . A drip , a drop , a vacant lot . My brain is gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with words and symbols , a dictionary of singing birds and rising moons , a portal to cognition . <p> Abstract thinking - what a notion ! What a crazy plan ! Grammar , syntax , symbolic logic . Syllogisms . Aphorisms . Dogma . Opinion . A worm I am , a worm of constant cogitation . A philosophizing worm , a psychologizing worm , a pontificator , a prognosticator , a worm of wit and aspiration , a worm of cortical distinction , a worm of brain . <p> Instinct is so boring . So minimal , so common . It lacks originality , to say nothing of sophistication . It 's so lowly , so wormish , so filthy in a way . That lady who I talk to finds my saying this astonishing . <p> - why ? I want to know . <p> - Instinct is important . It brings animals in contact . It 's vital for having offspring . Also , it acts as a warning signal . <p> - Instinct has its limits , I say . <p> - Living within limits is what living is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man . Right ? <p> - For anything . <p> -I do n't want limits . <p> - Ah , this lady says dryly. -A worm of ambition . <p> - Is that bad ? <p> - Ambition ? No . Not at all . In fact , it 's sort of what I had in mind . At this , I want to show this lady what I can do . I want to boast a bit . And so I say , - It 's important to know a right word from an almost right word . Critically important . Want to know how critical it is ? <p> Lickity-split , this lady snaps at my bait . Okay . How critical is it ? <p> - First think of lightning . <p> - All right . I 'm thinking of lightning . <p> - Now think of a lightning bag . <p> -A what ? <p> -A , lightning bag . <p> It 's sort of a gag , and I wait for this lady to grasp it . To say good job , how scholarly , how witty , how smart . I wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm thinking , this woman is slow . <p> - It 's a saying , I add as a hint . - By Mark Twain . <p> - Ah , this lady says at last . - Now I know . <p> I glow ( which is a trick , for I 'm not a glow worm ) , and with pomposity I crow , -I 'm a worm of philological proclivity . <p> - It 's not bag , says this lady . <p> - What ? <p> - Bag is wrong . Sorry . <p> So high only an instant ago , my spirits hit bottom . <p> - Almost . Good try . <p> -I 'm no good with words , I groan . -I 'm a fool . A clown . A hack . <p> - Not to worry , says this lady . - A worm with . a brain , aphasic and silly or not , is no piddling thing . Any transmission at all is historic . <p> So I was n't born a prodigy . So what ? In a way I was n't born at all . Nowadays , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't obligatory for a living thing to spring forth . <p> I 'm a split-brain proposition , an anatomic fiction , a hybrid born of wizardry and magic . I 'm a canon , if not to wisdom , to ambition and faith . My tomorrows , all in all , look rosy . Daily I grow in ability . <p> What I 'm hoping for-what I 'm anticipating-is not simply a facility with words . I want a total grasp , I want command . Grammar , syntax , jargon , slang - I want it all , and I want it right , as right as rain . <p> Words bring glory . Words bring favor . <p> Words stir spirits , and words transform . <p> Words will lift this thing I am as hands lift worms from dirt . Or wo n't . <p> Fact is , I do n't rightly know . It 's my first go at all this . I 'm winging it . Totally . <p> Talk is simply talk . If I had arms , I 'd do . <p> At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eloquent , articulate , pretentious and tendentious , verbose and possibly erroneous , but most of all , immensely grateful for what I am . And what is that ? I 've explained before , or tried . But I 've been hampered . Today I 'll try again . <p> I 'm Caenorhabditis elegans , a worm of mud and dirt , presently residing in a petri dish in a green and white-walled research laboratory . At least at root I am this worm , which is to say , that 's how I began . Grafted onto me for more precisely , into me ) , in ways most clever and ingenious , is the central neurologic apparatus of Homo sapiens , that is , a human brain . The grafting took place genomically , before I technically came into existence . The birth and study of the mind is the object of this exercise . The subject , need I say , is me . <p> Why me and not some other creature , a lobster , say , a mouse , a sponge ? Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken apart and put together ; each and every building block of mine , from gene to cell to protein , has been defined . Many of my genes , conserved through evolution , are similar to human genes and therefore objects of great interest . Some , in fact , are identical to human genes . Which means that C. elegans and H. sapiens are , in some small way , the same . <p> My source of information on all this , apart from my own rambling internal colloquy and self-examination , is the lady who attends to me . Her name is Sheila Downey . She is a geneticist , a bench scientist as well as a theoretician , and a fount of knowledge . She communicates to me through an apparatus that turns her words to wire-bound signals that my auditory cortex reads . Similarly , using other apparati , she feeds visual , tactile and other information to me . I communicate to her via efferent channels throughout my cortex , the common thread of which is carried through a cluster of filaments embedded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alternatively , my words can be printed out or displayed on screen . <p> She says that while I am by no means the first chimeric life form , I am by far the most ambitious and advanced . Far more than , say , bacteria , which for years have been engineered to carry human genes . <p> Not that I should be compared to them . Those bacterial hybrids of which she speaks exist only as a means to manufacture proteins . They 're little more than tiny factories , nothing close to sentient . <p> Not that they would n't like to be . Bacteria , believe me , will take whatever they can get . The little beasts are never satisfied . They 're opportunistic and self-serving , grasping ( and often pilfering ) whatever is at hand . They reproduce like rabbits and mutate seemingly at will . In the kingdom of life there are none more uppity or ambitious , not surprising given their lowly origins . They 're an uncouth and primitive breed , never content , always wanting more . <p> Worms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . Of the higher phyla we are rivaled only by the insects in our ubiquity . We 're flexible , adaptable , enlightened in our choice of habitats . We 're gender friendly , able to mate alone or with one another . And for those of you conversant with the Bible , you will recall that , unlike the insect horde , we 've never caused a plague . <p> I myself am a roundworm ( at least I started out as one ) , and as such , am partial to roundworms . Compared to our relatives the flatworms distant relatives , not to draw too fine a line ) , a roundworm has an inherently more rounded point of view . Living as we do nearly everywhere - in water , soil , and plants , as well as in the tissues and guts of countless creatures - we take a broad view of the world . We know a thing or two about diversity and know we ca n't afford to be intolerant . Like anyone , we have our likes and dislikes , but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some say we are overly diffident , that we shy from the spotlight , squirm , as it were , from the light of day . To this I say that modesty is no great sin . In the right hands humility can be a powerful weapon . Certainly , it is one that is frequently misunderstood . <p> Still , it is a trait of our family , though not by any means the only one . Certain of my cousins are assertive ( some would say aggressive ) in their behavior . They stick their noses in other creatures ' business and insinuate themselves where they 're not wanted . Trichinella , for example , will , without invitation , burrow into human muscle . Ancylostoma will needle into the intestine , piercing the wall and lodging there for years to suck the human blood . Wuchereria prefer the lymph glands . Onchocerca the eye . And Dracunculus , the legendary fiery serpent , will cut a swath from digestive tract to epidermis , erupting from the skin in a blaze of necrotic glory . Diffident , you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craves water . It would rather die ( and usually does ) than do without . <p> I myself am less dramatically inclined . I 'd rather garner attention for what I am than what I do . On the whole , I 'm easy to work with , humble without being self-effacing , clever without being snide . I 've a quiet sort of beauty , muted , elegant . Hence my name . <p> Unlike my parasitic cousins mentioned previously , I do not depend on others for my survival . I live in soil , mud and dirt , free of attachments , independent . I am no parasite , nor would I ever choose to be . <p> That said , I understand perfectly the temptations of the parasitic lifestyle . The security of a warm intestine , the plenitude of food , the comfort of the dark . I do not judge my cousins harshly for what they are . Their path has led them one direction ; mine , another . I 've never had to think of others , never had to enter them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had to suffer the vagaries of another creature 's behavior . <p> Never until now . <p> A worm a millimeter long , weighing barely more than a speck of dust , attached to a brain the size of a football . Imagine ! And now imagine all the work involved to keep this venture going . All the work on Sheila Downey 's part and all the work on mine . Cooperation is essential . I can no longer be self-centered or even casually independent . I can not ' hide in muck ( not that there is any in this hygienic place ) and expect to live . I 'm a captive creature , under constant surveillance , utterly dependent on my keeper . I must subordinate myself in order to survive . <p> Does this sound appalling ? Unfair and unappealing ? If it does , then think again . All freedoms come at the expense of other freedoms . All brains are captives of their bodies . All minds are captives of their brains . <p> I am a happy creature . My body is intact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is free to wander . I have my ease ( I got them yesterday ) , and miracle of miracles , I have my ewes , too . You , I mean . My u 's . <p> And having them , I now have everything . If there 's such a thing as bliss , this must be it . <p> Unfathomable , I now can say . <p> Unconscionable . <p> Unparalleled , this scientific achievement . <p> Unnatural . <p> I 'm in a funk sometimes ( this captive life ) . <p> I 'm going nowhere , and it 's no fun . <p> And yet it 's only natural that science experiment and try new things . <p> In truth , it 's unbelievable what I am . Unimaginable how far I 've come . <p> From stupid to stupendous . <p> From uninspired to unprecedented . <p> An upwardly mobile worm ... howunusual . How presumptuous . How morally ambiguous . How puerile and unsettling . How absurd . <p> Mixing species as though we were ingredients in a pancake batter . Cookbook medicine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and corrupt . <p> How , you might well ask , is all this done ? This joining of the parts , this federation , this majestic union of two such disparate entities , worm and man ? With wires and tubes and couplers , that 's how . With nano this and nano that . Baths of salt and percolating streams of micro-elements , genomic plug-ins , bilayer diffusion circuits and protein gradients , syncretic information systems . I 'm a web of filaments so fine you can not see , a juggle of electrocurrents , an interdigitated field of biomolecules and interactive membranes . Worm to brain and brain to worm , then both together to a most excellent machine , that 's how it 's done . With sleight of hand and spit and polish and trial and tribulation . It seems miraculous , I know . It looks like magic . That 's science for you . The how is for the scientists . The why and wherefore are for the rest of us , the commoners , the hoi polloi , like me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the object of attention . I most certainly am , and have every hope of living up to expectations , whatever those might be . Each wire in my brain is like a wish to learn . Each is like a wish to give up information . Each is like a thank you . <p> They do not hurt . I can not even feel them . They ground me ( in all the meanings of that word ) , but they 're also a kind of tether . The irony of this is not lost on me . <p> I 'm no parasite but no longer am I free . No longer free to live in mud and filth , where a meal and a crap pretty much summed up my life . No longer free to live without tomorrows for yesterdays ) . Living without language , like living in the moment , is a hopeless sort of living , which is to say unburdened . No longer free to live like that . Lucky me . <p> My newborn mind is vast , my neural net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions swirl through it , but all pale before the single thought , the central one , of my existence . Who am I ? Why am I here ? <p> Sheila Downey says I should n't bother with such questions . They have no answers , none that are consistent , certainly none that can be proved . Life exists . It 's a fact-you could even say an accident- of nature . <p> There 's no reason for it . It just is . <p> But I 'm no accident . I was put together for a purpose . Was n't I ? Is n't there a plan ? <p> - You 're here , she says . - Be satisfied . <p> I should be , should n't I ? I would be , were I still a simple worm . But I 'm not , and so I ask again that most human , it would seem , of questions . <p> What 's the point ? Why was I made ? <p> Sheila Downey does n't answer . For some reason she seems reluctant . <p> At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I have a number of theories , which I 'm happy to share . One , she wants to learn how the brain works . More specifically , she wants to learn about language , how words are put together , how they 're made and un-made , how they dance . Two , she wants to study how two dissimilar creatures live together , how they co-exist . Three ( the least likely possibility but the closest to my heart ) , she wants to learn more about worms . <p> - Very interesting , says Sheila Downey . <p> - Which is it ? <p> - Oh , she says , -I 'll be looking at all of them . <p> Which answers the question . Though somehow it does n't . What I mean is , I have the feeling she 's holding something back . <p> Why , I wonder , would she do that ? What is there to hide ? I sense no danger here . And even if there were , what could such omnipotence as hers possibly have to fear ? <p> Today I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until today . Before I had the word for it , I had no idea there was even such a thing as love . It 's possible there was n't . <p> Sheila Downey is the object of my affection . Sheila Downey , my creator , who bathes my brain in nutrients , manipulates my genome , fixes my electrodes . Sheila Downey , so gentle , professional , and smart . What fingertips she has ! What dextrous joints ! She croons to me as she works , coos in what I think must be a dove-like voice . Sometimes she jokes that she is no more human than I am , that she is a chimera , too . I was born a pigeon , she says , laughing . But then she says , not really . I was born a clumsy ox , or might have been , the way I feel sometimes . Only lately have things fallen into place . <p> - What things ? I ask . <p> - You , for one , she says . <p> I swell with pride . ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever vigilant , adjusts my osmolarity . ) <p> - You are a very brainy worm , she says . - It took a very brainy person to make you . And that person , along with a few significant others , was me . <p> -I 'm yours , I say quite literally . <p> - Well , yes . I guess you are . <p> - You care for me . <p> - You know I do . Both day and night . <p> - What I mean is , you care about me . Right ? <p> She seems surprised that I would question this . - Yes . In all sorts of ways . <p> At this my heart turns over ( although , stictly speaking I do not have a heart ; it 's my fluid , my oozy goo , that shifts and turns ) . <p> -I need you , Sheila Downey . She laughs . - Of course you do . <p> - Do you need me ? <p> -1 suppose , she says . - You could look at it that way . You could say we need each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the star , she says . - Like the singer , the song . Like that . Yes . We do . <p> It was at this point that I fell in love . It was as if a ray of light had pierced a world of darkness . Or conversely , a hole of darkness had suddenly opened in a world composed solely of light . Prior to that moment , love simply did not exist . <p> Sheila Downey was interested in this . She asked how I knew it was love . <p> I replied that I knew it the same way I knew everything . The notion came to me . The letters made a word that seemed to more or less describe a chain of cortical and sub-cortical activity . Was I wrong ? <p> She replied that love might be a slight exaggeration . Gratitude and appreciation were probably closer to the truth . But the definitions were n't important . Of more interest to her was my continued facility for concept formation and abstract thinking . <p> -I 'm impressed , she said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were important , that meanings and shades of meanings were the essence of communication . I thought that words made all the difference . <p> - If this is n't love , I told her , - then tell me what is . <p> -I 'm no expert , said Sheila Downey . - But in my limited experience , having a body is fairly important . <p> -I do have a body . <p> - Understood . But you lack certain essential characteristics . Essential , that is , for a human . <p> - What ? Eyes ? Ears ? Arms and legs ? <p> - All of those , she said . <p> - But I can smell , I told her . -I can taste your chemicals . <p> -I wear latex . <p> - Latex ? <p> - Gloves , she clarified . <p> In other words , it 's not her I 'm tasting . So what , I say . So what that ours is not a physical attraction . I do n't need touch or smell or taste . The thought alone , the word , is sufficient . Having love in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . <p> When I was a worm , I acted like a worm . I thought like one . Now I think like a human , but I 'm still a worm . How puzzling . What , I wonder , makes a human fully human ? What exactly is a human I 'd like to know . <p> It 's more than a mammal with arms and legs and hair on its head , fingernails on its fingers , binocular vision , speech , and the like . What I mean is , it 's more than just a body , clearly more , for take away the limbs , take away the eyes and ears and voice , and still you have a human . Take away the gonads , replace the ovaries with hormones and the testicles with little plastic balls , replace the heart with metal and the arteries with dacron tubes , and still you have a human , perhaps even more so , concentrated in what 's left . <p> Well then how about the brain ? Is that what makes an animal uniquely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain is necessary ? Enough for language ? Forethought ? Enough to get by day to day ? Hour by hour ? Minute by minute ? Enough to tie a shoe ? To cook a turkey ? To chat with friends ? <p> And if a person loses brain to injury or disease , does he fall from the ranks of humanity ? If he can not speak or organize his thoughts , if he has no short or long-term memory , if he wets his pants and smears his feces , is he less a human ? Something else perhaps ? A new entity , whose only lasting link to humanity is the pity and discomfort he evokes ? <p> Well , what about the genome then , the touted human genome ? Does that define a human ? I do n't see how it can , not with genes routinely being added and subtracted , not with all the meddling that 's going on . Who 's to say a certain person 's not a product of engineering ? Maybe he 's got a gene he did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And where 'd he get that gene ? Maybe from a fungus . Or a sheep . Maybe from a worm . <p> You see my difficulty . It 's hard to know one 's place without knowing one 's species . If I 'm a worm , so be it , but I 'd rather be a human . Humans tread on worms ( and nowadays they take apart their genes ) , not the other way around . <p> Sheila Downey says I should n't worry about such things . The distinctions that I 'm grappling with , besides being of little practical value , are no longer germane . Taxonomy is an anachronism . In the face of bioengineering , the celebrated differentiation of the species is of historic interest only . <p> She does , however , continue to be impressed by the level of my mentation . She encourages me to keep on thinking . <p> This gets my goat . ( My goat ? What goat ? I wonder . ) <p> - There is a goat , says Sheila Downey cryptically , - but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , - You want to know what you are ? I 'll tell you . You 're nineteen thousand ninety-nine genes of Caenorhabditis elegans and seventeen thousand forty-four genes of Homo sapiens . Taking into account the homologous sequences , you 're 61.8 percent worm and 38.2 percent human . That 's not approximate . It 's exact . <p> Somehow this information does n't help . <p> - That 's because it does n't matter what you call yourself , she says . <p> - It does n't matter where you think you fit . That 's subjective , and subjectivity only leads to misunderstanding . What matters is what you are . You and you alone . <p> Respectfully , I disagree . Alone is not a state of nature . What you are depends on who you 're with . Differences and distinctions matter . The ones who say they do n't are the ones who have n't been trod upon . Or perhaps not trod upon enough . <p> - Poor worm , she says . - Have you been abused ? The world 's not just , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She gives a harsh sort of laugh . - Why ? Because our instinct for it is n't strong enough . Maybe that 's something we should work on . What do you think ? Should we fortify that instinct ? Should we R &; D the justice gene ? <p> By this point my head is spinning . I do n't know what to think . <p> She says I should n't tax myself . - Relax . Look on the bright side . This sense of indignation you 're feeling is a very human trait . <p> - Really ? <p> - Oh yes . Very . That should make you happy . <p> I 'm ashamed to say it does . <p> - Shame , too ? How precocious of you . I 'm impressed . <p> She pauses , and her voice drops , as if to share something closer to the heart . <p> - My sympathies , little worm . <p> I have an inexplicable urge to mate , to wrap myself around another body , to taste its oozing salts and earthy humors , to feel the slimy freshness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to knot and curl and writhe . The urge is close to irresistible . I 'm all atingle . It 's as if another elegans is nearby , calling me , wooing me , sirening me with its song . <p> Sheila Downey assures me this is not the case . There is no other worm . It 's an hallucination , a delusion , triggered , she suspects , by an instinct to preserve my wormness through procreation , a reflex mechanism for perpetuation and survival of the species gone awry . She hypothesizes that I 'm experiencing a rebound effect from my preoccupation with being human . That the pendulum , as it were , is swinging back . She finds it interesting , if not curious , that my worm identity remains so strong . -I expected it to be overshadowed , she says . <p> The way I 'm feeling I wish it were . Craving what I can not have ( what does not even exist ) is tantamount , it seems , to craving death . This is strange and unfamiliar territory to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are refusing to be enlightened by your higher ones . As if your primitive brain , your elemental one , is rebelling . <p> I apologize if this is how it seems . I do not mean to be rebellious . Perhaps the pH of my fluid needs adjustment . Perhaps I need some medicine to calm me down . <p> - No , she says . - Let 's wait and see what happens . <p> Wait ? While I writhe and twitch and make a fool of myself ? While I hunger for relief and moan ? <p> Of course we 'll wait . How silly of me to think otherwise . Science begins with observation , and Sheila Downey is a scientist . We 'll watch and wait together , all three of us , the woman who made me what I am , the worm that is n't there , and me . <p> On further thought ( and thought is what I have , my daily exercise , my work , my play , my everything ) I uncover a possible answer to my question . What makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone will cut another animal up for study , she alone will blithely take apart another creature for something other than a meal . <p> Sheila Downey says I may be right , although again , she is n't very interested in what she calls the field of idle speculation . <p> But I , it seems , am interested in little else . - Is that why I was made ? To be like that ? <p> She will not answer , except to turn the question back on me. - Is that how you want to be ? <p> The human in me , I have to admit , is curious . The worm , quite definitely , is not . <p> -I 'm of two minds , I reply . <p> This comes as no surprise to her . - Of course you are . Does it seem strange ? <p> - Does what ? <p> - Having two minds , two consciousnesses , alive inside of you at once ? It seems strange sometimes to have even one . But mostly , no , it does n't . On the contrary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm made . It would seem strange if I were different . <p> I wonder , then , if this is why I was made . To bring our species closer . To prove that two can work together as one . <p> -A noble thought , says Sheila Downey . <p> Now there 's a word that sends a shiver down my spineless spine . A noble thought to bring , perchance , a noble prize . <p> - But not as noble as the truth , she adds portentously , then pauses . At length she continues . -I 'll tell you why we made you , she says . <p> - Because that 's what we do . We humans . We make things . And then we study them , and then we make them over if we have to . We make them better . It 's why we 're here on Earth . If there is a why . To make things . <p> - And this is being human ? <p> - It 's part of being human . The best part . <p> - Then I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make things , too . <p> - Do you , worm ? She sounds amused . Then she lapses into silence , and many moments pass before she speaks again . Her voice is different now : subdued , confessional . <p> - You want to know why we made you ? <p> I remind her that she told me why . Just now . Has she forgotten ? <p> - No , she says . - The real reason . The truth . <p> How many truths , I wonder , can there be ? <p> - Because we had the tools and technology . Because someone asked the question . Not , is this experiment worthwhile , is it beneficial ? Not that question , but can we do it ? That 's the real reason we made you . Because we could . <p> She bears some guilt for this . I 'm not sure why . <p> - Is that detestable to you ? she asks . <p> I tell her no . I 'm grateful that she made me . Humans making other humans seems the epitome of what a human is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . They say that just because we can do something does n't mean we should . They say that science should be governed by a higher precept than simple curiosity . <p> - And what do you say ? <p> -I say they do n't understand what science is . It 's human nature to be curious . There 's no purpose to it . There 's no reason . It 's a hunger of the brain , a tropism , like a plant turning to the sun , to light . <p> Her mention of this tropism gives me pause . Traditionally , worms avoid the sun . It makes us easy prey . It dries us out . But now I feel slightly differently . I 'd like a chance to see it . I 'm curious about the light . <p> Sheila Downey is n't done with her defense of science . - It 's a force of nature . Morals simply do n't apply . It proceeds regardless of ethics , regardless of propriety and sometimes even decency . That 's what makes it ugly sometimes . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not hurting . <p> - Little worm , she says , with something sweet yet biting in her voice . <p> - So self-absorbed . Progress never comes without a price . The boons of science always hurt . <p> Basilisk , real or not ? Not . <p> Sphinx ? Not . <p> Minotaur ? Forget it . <p> Pan ? A goat-man ? No way . <p> And all those centaurs and satyrs , those gorgons and gargoyles , mermaids and manticores - phonies , the whole lot of them . <p> And while we 're at it , how about those cherubim ? Fat-cheeked , plump little nuggets of joy hovering in the tintoretto air like flies - I mean , get real . They 'd be scared to death up there . And those tiny little wings would never hold them up . <p> I alone am real . Thirty-six thousand one hundred and forty-three genes and counting . The first and now the first again ( Madam , I 'm Adam ) . The Avatar . The Pride of Man . The Toast of Nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crossroads . I can no longer be kept alive in my current state . My body , that is , can not sustain my brain . We have a choice to make . <p> A choice . How wonderful . I 've never had a choice before . <p> - One , we sever the connection between your body and your brain . <p> - Sever ? <p> - Snip snip , she says . - Then we look at each of them more closely . <p> - How close ? <p> - Very close , she says . - Layer by cortical layer . Cell by cell . Synapse by synapse . <p> - You dissect me . <p> - Yes . That 's right . <p> - Will it hurt ? <p> - Has anything hurt yet ? <p> She has a point . Nothing has . And yet , for reasons I ca n't explain , I seem to be hurting now . <p> - You 're not , she says . - You ca n't feel pain . <p> - No ? This sudden sense of doom I feel , this tremor of impending loss .. these are n't painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hesitates , as though uncertain what to say . As though she , like me , might be more than a single creature , with more than a single point of view . I wonder . Is it possible ? Might she be suffering a little , too ? <p> She admits it 'll be a sacrifice . She 'll miss me . <p> I 'll miss her , too . But more than anything , I 'll miss myself . <p> - Silly worm . You wo n't . You wo n't remember . Your words and memories will all be gone . <p> - And you ? Will you be gone ? <p> - To you I will . And someday you 'll be gone to me , too . I 'll be gone to myself . Being gone is part of being here , it 's part of being human . Someday it wo n't be , probably someday soon . But for now it is . <p> This gives me strength , to know that Sheila Downey will also die . I wonder , will she be studied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -I ca n't imagine anyone being interested . <p> -I would be . <p> Another laugh , a warmer one . - Tit for tat , is it ? My inquisitive little worm . If only you had hands and eyes to do the job . <p> - Give me them , I say . Give me arms and legs and ears and eyes . Please , Sheila Downey . Make me human . <p> -I ca n't , she says . I ca n't do that . But I do have an alternative . <p> - What 's that ? <p> - We have a goat . <p> -A goat . <p> - Yes . A fine Boer buck . A very handsome fellow . I think he 'll hold up nicely . <p> - Hold up to what ? <p> - The surgery . <p> She waits as if I 'm supposed to answer , but I 'm not sure what she 's asking . So I wait , too . <p> - Well ? she asks . <p> - Well what ? <p> - Should we give it a shot ? Take your brain and put it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not joking . <p> I ask her why . <p> - Why what ? <p> -A goat . Why a goat ? <p> - Ah . Because we have one . <p> Of course . Science is nothing if not expedient . <p> - The other reason is because it 's feasible . That is , we think we have a chance . We think we can do it . <p> This I should have known . But the fact is , I 've never wanted to be a goat . Not ever . Not once . Not even part of once . <p> - Maybe so , she says . But remember , you never wanted to be a human until you got a human brain . <p> I recall her saying once that living within limits is what living is . I 'm sure I should be grateful , but this so-called alternative is hard to stomach . It 's like offering an arm to a person who 's lost a leg . A pointless charity . <p> Moreover , it seems risky . How , I wonder , can they even do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - With care , says Sheila Downey . <p> Of that I have no doubt . But I 'm thinking more along the lines of size and shape and dimensional disparity . I 'm thinking that is , of my soft and tender brain stuffed into the small and unforgiving skull of a goat . Forgive me , but I 'm thinking there might be a paucity of space . <p> She admits they 'll have to make adjustments . <p> - What kind of adjustments ? <p> - We 'll pare you down a bit . Nothing major . Just a little cortical trim . <p> - Snip snip , eh , Sheila Downey ? <p> - If it 's any consolation , you wo n't feel it . Most likely you wo n't even notice . <p> That 's what scares me most . That I 'll be different and not know it . Abridged , reduced , diminished . <p> I 'd rather die . <p> - Posh , she says . <p> - Help me , Sheila Downey . If you care for me at all , do this for me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denoting what , I wonder ? Impatience ? Disappointment ? Regret ? - It 's not possible . I 've told you . <p> - No ? <p> - No . Not even remotely possible . <p> - Fine . Then kill me . <p> An ultimatum ! How strange to hear such words spring forth . How unwormly and - dare I say it - human of me . <p> I ca n't believe that she will actually do it , that she will sacrifice what she herself has made . I ca n't believe it , and yet of course I can . <p> She sighs again , as though it 's she who 's being sacrificed , she who 's being squeezed into a space not her own . <p> - Oh , worm , she says . What have we done ? <p> I 've had a dream . I wish that I could say that it was prescient , but it was not . I dreamed that I was a prince , a wormly prince , an elegant , deserving prince of mud and filth . And in this dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I her . An ugly thing of golden hair and rosy cheeks , she spurned me once , she spurned me twice , she spurned me time and time again , until at last she placed me in her palm and took me home . She laid me on her bed . We slept entwined . And when I woke , I had become a human , and the maiden had become a princess , small enough to fit in my palm . I placed her there . I thought of all her hidden secrets , her mysteries . I 'd like to get to know you , I said , enraptured . Inside and out . I 'd like to cut you up ( no harm intended ) . I really would . <p> Did I say I 'd never be a goat ? Did I say I 'd rather die ? Perhaps I spoke a bit too hastily . My pride was wounded . <p> In point of fact , I will be a goat . I 'll be anything Sheila Downey says . She has the fingers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might . <p> Words and thoughts are wonderful , and reason is a fine conceit . But instinct rules the world . And Sheila Downey 's instinct rules mine . She will slice and dice exactly as she pleases , pick apart to her heart 's content and fuss with putting back together until the cows come home . She 's eager and she 's restless and she has no way to stop . And none to stop her . Certainly not me . <p> So yes , I will be a goat . I 'll be a goat and happy for it . I 'll be a goat and proud . <p> If this means a sliver or two less cortex , so be it . Less cortex means less idle thought . Fewer hopes that wo n't materialize . Fewer dreams that have no chance of ever coming true . <p> I doubt that I will love again , but then I doubt that I will care . <p> I doubt that I will doubt again , but this , I think , will be a blessing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't doubt . She sets her sights , and then she acts . She is the highest power , and I 'm her vessel . <p> Make that vassal . <p> Command me , Sheila Downey . Cut me down to size . Pare me to your purpose . <p> Yours is a ruthless enterprise . Ruthless , but not without merit . <p> This world of yours , of hybrids and chimeras , humans and parthumans , promises to be an interesting world . Perhaps it will also be a better one . Perhaps more fun . <p> What good in this ? For humans , the good inherent in making things . <p> The good in progress . The good in living without restraint . <p> What good for worms ? That 's simple . No good . <p> All the better , then , that I wo n't know . <p> But will I ? Will I know ? Today 's the day , and soon I 'll be this capricornis personality , yet one more permutation in a line of permutations stretching back to the dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems certain . But thought , will that building also crumble ? And words , the bricks that make the building , will they disintegrate , too ? <p> And if they do , what then will I be , what kind of entity ? A lesser one I can not help but think . But less of more is still more than I ever was before . It does no good to rail at fate or chew the cud of destiny , at least no good to me . If I lose u 's , so what ? I 'll lose the words unhappy and ungrateful . I 'll lose unfinished and unrestrained . Uxorious I doubt will be an issue . Ditto usury . And ululation seems unlikely for a goat . <p> And after that , if I lose more , who cares ? I 'll fill my mind with what I can , with falling rain , crisp air and slanting light . I 'll climb tall hills and sing what I can sing . I 'll walk in grass . <p> Living is a gift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ram , and as a man . <p> Call a pal . <p> Bang a pan <p> Say thanks . <p> Adapt . <p> Author Affiliation
