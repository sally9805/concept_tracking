SHOPGIRLS You watch the pretty salesgirl slide a box of Halston soap onto a low shelf , watch her braid slip off her shoulder , watch like an adolescent as the vent at the neck of her blouse opens slightly she is twenty , maybe twenty-two , tan , and greatly freckled . She wears a dark blue V-neck blouse without a collar , and her skirt is white cotton , calf length , slit up the right side to a point just beneath her thigh . Her hair , a soft blond , is pulled straight and close to the scalp , woven at the back into a single thick strand . In the fluorescent light of the display cabinet her eye shadow shines . She catches you staring and gives you a perfunctory but knowing smile , and you turn quickly to study the purses on the chrome rack next to where you stand . You are embarrassed . You open a large red purse from the rack and stick your hand inside , pretending to inspect the lining . Then you lift the purse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you determine the quality of the leather . The truth is that having sniffed the skin of the purse , you do n't know what material it is , and , for just an instant , that troubles you . You look more closely at the purse , twisting the lip a little so you can see the label , on which , in very small print , it says : MAN-MADE MATERIALS . After what seems like a long time , you glance again at the perfume counter : the girl is not there . You drop the red purse back onto its hook , and stand on your toes looking for the girl . Then you start toward the center of the purse department for a clearer view . " Can we help you with something ? " It 's the salesgirl in Purses . She 's thin , a brunette , with stylized makeup that seems to carve her face . She 's wearing a thin black silklike dress a sundress , and her shoulders are bare . She has caught you off guard and presses her advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your forearm . " Sir ? " " Well , " you begin , " I was looking for a gift . " " Of course you were , " the girl says . The tone is patronizing . She has seen you staring at the blond girl in Perfumes . " For my wife , " you say . " Something in the way of a purse , " she says . " Or perhaps a nice perfume ? " " I 'd better go , " you say , but she tightens her grip on your arm and glances over a lightly rouged shoulder at a middle-aged woman who is standing impatiently at the far end of the purse department . " I have a customer , " the salesgirl says . " But why do n't you wait a minute and talk to me ? Jenny says you 're very handsome but painfully shy are you shy ? Will you wait ? " You laugh self-consciously . " I 'll get rid of her , " the girl says . " Be right back . " As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving thin white trace lines . You watch her show the woman a purse , watch her arms move as she selects a second purse off a treelike stand , watch the way she cocks one foot up on its toe behind the other as she sells . The soft black skirt ripples and clings gently to the backs of her thighs as she moves , and when she goes behind the cash register to ring the sale , one of the straps falls off her shoulder , and she pulls it back into place routinely , smiling past her customer at you . * * * " Jenny says you followed her everywhere for weeks , is that so ? All around here ? " Finished with the middle-aged woman , the salesgirl has come back to you . " I do n't know Jenny , " you say . But when the girl tugs at your arm and points over the tops of the displays toward the shoe section , you do n't need to look . You know the girl she 's talking about , the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You trailed her around the store and around the mall for a few weeks , watching her shop , watching her eat , watching her sit by the garishly painted fountain in the center of the mall you trailed her until you got worried . Then you stayed out of the mall for nearly two weeks , and when you returned you carefully avoided Shoes . That 's not entirely true . Once you spent half the morning going up and down the escalator so that you could see her over the thickly forested juniors ' casual wear . " She likes you , " the brunette says . " I think when you started in on Sally it hurt her feelings , Jenny 's , I mean . " You nod to indicate that you have understood , then realize you should n't understand , so you say , " Sally ? " " Sally ? " the salesgirl says , mimicking you , exaggerating your delivery until it is a high prissy whine . " Sally 's the blond you 've been staring at all morning while playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . You think you should have left when you had the chance , but the salesgirl has her hand on you again , her nails biting your skin , and to leave you 'd have to jerk yourself out of her grip . " Half the day , " the girl says deliberately , " and that 's a conservative estimate . That 's this morning only . Then there 's yesterday , and Saturday you 're quite a regular around here , are n't you ? At first Sally thought you were the store dick , but she checked with Mr. Bo he 's our manager for this floor and found out you were n't . My name 's Andrea , what 's yours ? " You do n't want to tell her that . " Wiley Pitts , " you say . It 's a football player 's name you saw in the morning paper . " I 'm thirty-six years old . " Instinctively you reach out to shake hands , then abruptly withdraw your hand and lift it to your forehead where a thin string of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you nervous ? " she asks . " You should n't be nervous . Come sit with me . " She guides you by the arm to a small round-topped stool in front of her sales counter . " I have to stick pretty close to this , " she says , tapping the cash register with one bright fingernail . You take the seat . You are inexplicably docile , obedient . You feel suddenly faint , as if moving about for the first time after a prolonged illness . Andrea is pretty , she smells pretty , she is being kind and gentle with you , and you are enjoying her attention . The sheen of her dress reflects the store light as she moves . " The others think you 're crazy , " she says , twirling her finger near her temple and smiling . " I said you were just lonely . " " I suppose I am , " you say . You cross your legs clumsily , then uncross them when you find it difficult to maintain your balance on the stool . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll tell you what I 'll get the others and we can go to lunch together , would you like that ? That way you can get a really close look at Sally . " " You 're very pretty , too , " you say . But as soon as you 've said it you feel you should n't have , and you say , " I 'm sorry . I do n't know why I said that . " " Of course I 'm pretty , " Andrea says , laughing , obviously pleased . " We 're all pretty . That 's why they hire us . Do you think they want ugly girls out here trying to sell this stuff ? We have to be pretty because that way the customers buy more so they can be pretty just like us . " She tucks and smooths her dress for a minute , for your benefit , then says , " Well ? What about it ? " Before you can reply , she 's on the telephone . You realize she is talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Andrea says , fingering the curled cord and looking at you , " I 'm sure he 's the same one you pointed him out , did n't you ? No , not at all . Very nice . Yes . No , no the first thing , yes . Right . Morrison 's . You tell Sally huh ? Yes , she will . " You watch a young woman customer in very tight shorts and a lavender tank top glide up the escalator , which is directly across the aisle from Purses . Then Andrea is off the phone . " Jenny 's very excited , " she says . " She did n't believe me at first . " You nod again , now staring at the empty escalator . " Listen , " Andrea says , " are you all right ? You look very depressed . " She tosses her hair over her shoulder and twists around on one leg to look at the store clock mounted on the wall above and behind her . " It 'll just be a few minutes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you ? Is your name really Pitts ? " " Robert , " you say sheepishly . " Robert Caul . I 'm sorry about the other . " But Robert Caul is not your name , either . " Oh , do n't worry about it , and do n't look so forlorn , Robert Caul , " she says . " You 're going to have a great time , really you are . It 'll be a dream come true . " " Yes , " you say . Then you look away , around the store , seeing only colors and shapes and reflections in columns that 've been turned into mirrors . Andrea moves off to chat with a customer , a young man in jeans who explains that his wife is pregnant and needs a new purse for when the baby comes . Finally , accidentally , you look toward Perfumes , and the blond girl is back , sitting primly on a tall stool inside her glass enclosure , talking on a black telephone and toying with the braid in her hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cafeteria with Andrea , Jenny , and Sally , you take a thin slice of roast heel three round white potatoes , a salad , and a shallow cup of peas . The women talk to one another as the four of you slide your trays over the polished aluminum rails attached to the serving counter . They are talking about you , whispering , being a little impolite , but you do n't mind . You laugh , too , and smile to yourself as if you are in on the joke . When everyone is seated at the table by the window , Jenny says , " Why are you doing this ? " The window is the size of a bathroom window , small and heavily curtained . It looks out into the center of the mall . " Never mind that , " Andrea says . " He sure is handsome , is n't he ? " " Within certain well-known guidelines , " Sally says . " Posh , " Andrea says , smiling at you . " You really scared me at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know what you wanted . But then I got used to it , and I was n't scared anymore . " " You were going out of your skull , " Sally says . " Admit it . " " Sure , at first , " Jenny says . " After he 'd followed me for a week , I almost went up and introduced myself one day . " " He wishes you had , " Andrea says . " Do n't you , Robert ? " " I do n't know , " you say . " Not exactly maybe . " You try to smile , but your lip catches on your teeth somehow , hooks itself there , and your smile feels horrible . " I like a man who knows his mind , " Sally says . " Oh , leave him alone , Sally , " Andrea says . " Ca n't you see he 's nervous ? " " What 's he nervous about ? " " You , " Jenny says . " He thinks you 're beautiful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that does n't mean I do n't like him . I do like you , Robert . Really . " " Listen to her , " Jenny says . " It takes her two hours every day to look like that , and she 's so blas . " " It 's worth it , " Sally says , wiping a small cone of mayonnaise off her dark lower lip with the tip of her third finger . " It makes me a more sensual person . " " If you were any more sensual , " Jenny says , " you 'd be an open sore . " " We had to go to school to learn how to look , Robert , " Andrea says . " Would you believe that ? " " Some of us did , " Sally says . Jenny bobs her head and mouths some words to make fun of Sally , then turns to you : " We 're professionals , like models . We make the women envious and we make the men feel cheated , and that 's not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk much , does he ? " Sally says , waving her fork in your direction . " What are we going to do with him ? " " We 're not doing anything , " Andrea says . " I 'm taking him home with me . " She drops her fingers over your wrist and pats you twice . " We all live in the same complex , Casa del Sol ever hear of it ? " " I do n't , " you say . " I mean , I never heard of it , no . Sorry , Andrea . " " It 's got a hot tub , " Sally says proudly . " More than one , in fact . " " Six , " Jenny says , smiling . " By actual count . Of course , some are hotter than others . " The three women laugh at this joke , then Sally says to you , " Jenny would know , she 's a real hot-tub artist . " " Thanks , Sally , " Jenny says . " You know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reminds me of one of the Dead BoysI ca n't remember which one , though . I think it 's the one they call Johnny . " " Jeff , " Jenny says . " I saw them last week at the Palace , but he does n't look much like Jeff , anyway . " You look down at your plate and see that you have cut your roast beef into tiny squares less than an inch on a side , and you have stacked the squares one on top of the other in three small piles . You begin to play with your peas , lifting them onto your plate with the fork and then pushing them across the open center of the plate , encircling the stacks of beef . Sally says , " You 're not going to eat your salad , Robert ? I 'll eat it if you do n't want it . " She pulls your salad across the table , then turns to Jenny . " I wish somebody would tell me what we 're going to do with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " The dear girl . " " Why do n't we ask Robert what he wants us to do with him ? " Sally says . " We know what he wants , " Jenny says , pushing a large square of lettuce from your stolen salad into her mouth . " He wants to lurk around the store watching you bend over . " " Or you , " Sally says . " Or you , Andrea . " " We 're just friends , " Andrea says . " He can watch me at home . " " Well , " Sally says , suddenly pushing back her chair and standing up , " I think it 's me he really wants to look at . Is n't that right , Robert ? " She comes around to your side of the table and leans over you and wraps her bare arm around your head , then pulls back and with her other hand opens her blouse slightly . " See , Robert ? Is n't it pretty ? Tell the girls I 'm the one you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really like , " you say , but you do n't think Andrea and Jenny hear you because you can hear them laughing , although you ca n't see them because Sally has your head in an awkward position , her upper arm almost covering your eyes . " That 's nice , " Sally says , and she kisses you lightly on the top of your head . " Does n't prove anything , " Jenny says , dragging a napkin over her lips . " If I showed him mine , he 'd swear he 'd marry me ten times . " " He 'd swear you 'd been married ten times , " Sally says , " if memory serves . You 're a little lank through the chest , darling . " " Why , you cat , " Jenny says . " You bitch . " Laughing , Sally says , " You guys ready to go ? " " Come on , Andrea , " Jenny says , pushing her chair away from the table . " And bring your friend . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll be there in a minute . " Jenny and Sally walk out of the cafeteria together , and you watch them go , you watch the way each careful step causes a particular swing in the hipsthey strut , their sleek clothes snapping precisely . " That was fun , " you say . " Well , I 'm sorry , " Andrea says , looking at you over the rim of her coffee cup . " I did n't know . " * * * In the living room of Andrea 's Casa del Sol two-bedroom apartment identical white rented sofas face each other . You sit on one of these sofas . Andrea is not home . Her television is small , white , balanced on top of a tall straw basket in front of the window . There is a white Princess telephone on the back of the sofa opposite you . The late afternoon sun slants into the room , cutting across the twin sofas and casting dense , hard-looking shadows . You have the feeling that you are the only one home at Casa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbecued chickens she bought at the grocery store . The chickens are in aluminum foil pans , wrapped in clear plastic . You watch her unwrap the chickens and listen to her talk . " My father , " she says , picking at the skin on the breast of one of the chickens , " was a speedboat racer . Not for a living , but that 's what he was really . I have home movies of him on Lake Livingston , if you want to see . I 've got lots of movies , in fact , of the whole family Dad worked real hard editing the movies , putting them all in order by year , you know the kind of thing I mean . He even shot titles and put them in . He wanted so much for everything to make sense . " You notice that the legs of each chicken are twisted together so tightly that the bones have bent around each other . " He wanted to know how things worked , even the simplest things the air-conditioning , the movie projector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie projector was take it apart . Then he tried to improve on it , gluing little sticks of foam to the lens mount to cut down on the vibration and , when that did n't work , hooking rubber bands around the lens itself . It was terrible the way all his improvements did n't work . But he did n't notice that , or , if he did , he did n't talk about it . And he always did it , no matter what . He busted the television trying to make a better antenna , and he busted the stereo when he decided he could make a spindle that would drop fifteen records instead of the five the factory suggested . And the older he got , the worse it was . I mean , he just kept busting things and busting things until there was nothing to do but laugh , we all laughed , he even laughed , it was so horrible . " You listen and nod , but she 's finished . You do n't know why she 's telling you about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only light in the apartment is a tiny night-light pushed into a socket on the kitchen wall . Andrea is crying . You ask where Sally and Jenny live , thinking this will help , and Andrea leads you to her front window and points across an open courtyard , empty except for the brilliant green island of the pool , at some apartments in another building . " They do n't know you 're here , " Andrea says . " Do you want to go surprise them ? " " No , " you say . " Not tonight . " " My grandmother is ninety-one , " she says . " She lives in Palestine , Texas . She runs every day , she was running before everybody else started running , she was ahead . I do n't know , around here everybody runs now . You go out at six o'clock , and it looks like one of those sports shows on TV . There is n't any reason to run , but they do it anyway . Bunch of goons . They think just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . I bought the shoes , but that 's as far as it went . Are you getting hungry ? If we do n't eat I 'm going to scalp this chicken . " She serves you a quarter of a chicken neatly severed between breast and thigh and two slabs of white bread on a bare plate . This makes you very happy . For the first time you stop wondering if you should have taken her key after lunch . Andrea sits on one sofa and you sit on the other , and both of you eat with your fingers , occasionally stopping to tear away a bite-sized square of bread . You smile at each other as you eat . The chicken is tender and spicy , the perfect meal . When you finish , you carry your plate into the small kitchen and drop the bones into the garbage sack under the sink . Then you rinse the plate and turn it upside down on the flecked Formica counter , then you wash your hands with her Ivory soap . As you run the water over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , then over your entire face . You pull two paper towels off the roll alongside the sink and dry your face and hands . You throw the crumpled towels at the garbage sack , miss it by a full yard . When you return to the living room , Andrea is sitting in the semidarkness , licking her fingers . * * * " Once , when there was a hurricane coming , " she says , not talking directly to you but rather into the room and to herself , " my father required that we make all the preparations , and we checked the flashlights , counted the candles , drew clean water in the tubs and sinks , bought bottled water to drink , taped the huge bay windows in our house with gray duct tape , and nailed plywood over the smaller windows . He carefully plotted the storm 's course on a chart he cut out of the newspaper . The storm moved very slowly . My father called the weather service often , cursing and slamming the phone down when he got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stopped dead in its tracks for twenty hours , whirling itself into a two-hundred-mile-an-hour frenzy , and as the storm got larger and more powerful my father spent his time sitting silently by the radio , his head slightly bent , a coffee cup balanced on the arm of his chair . He would n't talk to any of us . He hushed us angrily when we tried to talk to one another . He was intent on the storm , and he sat up all night listening for news bulletins , marking and calculating on the crumpled chart in his lap . The radio spewed instructions about what to do in case of fire , what to do in case of flood , and also history the great and dangerous hurricanes of the century . We were prepared , and , as far as I knew , the real danger to us was minimal . Nevertheless a silence spread over our house like nothing I 'd ever felt before . The kids kept watch at the windows , but the weather outside looked fine and breezy . At eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather service : Elise had started to move again , but she had reversed her course and was now headed southwest , straight for Mexico . This news did not deter my father from his vigil , and , seven hours later , when the storm made landfall well below Brownsville , my father came to the door of his study and told us the news . He was a big man , a powerful man physically , and I remember him filling that doorway between his study and the living room of our house , I remember the way his voice sounded and how his eyes looked when he told us , and I remember watching him retreat into his study and close the door . He shot himself in the temple with a twenty-two-caliber pistol . " " Killed himself ? " you ask , sure that you should n't , sure that you already know the answer . " No , " Andrea says . " Crippled himself . In a wheelchair the rest of his life . " " I 'm sorry , " you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her red nails . * * * You notice for the first time that one of Andrea 's eyebrows is plucked too much , and that the brows are not symmetrical with respect to the bridge of her nose . Her left brow , the one that is far too thin , also starts well over her left eye . Once you have seen this tiny imbalance , you can not stop seeing it . Every time you look at Andrea 's face you see this odd-shaped patch of skin there above her nose . You stare at it . Her face looks wrong suddenly , almost deformed . You try to think of something to say about her father , but you ca n't think of anything . You wonder if you should ask Andrea about Sally and Jenny , but decide that that might hurt Andrea 's feelings , so you say nothing . You sit with her until well past midnight hours of occasional sound , occasional movement . When she decides to go to bed you make no move to follow her into the bedroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sofa , fully dressed , without even a sheet to cover you . You imagine yourself leaving the apartment on a sunny day in the middle of the week . Three beautiful women in tiny white bikinis lift their sunglasses as you pass them in the courtyard . They smile at you . You drive to the mall in a new car and spend two hours in Housewares on the second floor . You do not remember ever having been on the second floor before . You buy a wood-handled spatula from a lovely girl with clean short hair . Kitchen equipment is exquisite , you believe .
