What Drives Men // There is no truer statement : men are simple . Get this into your head first , and everything you learn about us in this book will begin to fall into place . Once you get that down , you 'll have to understand a few essential truths : men are driven by who they are , what they do , and how much they make . No matter if a man is a CEO , a CON , or both , everything he does is filtered through his title ( who he is ) , how he gets that title ( what he does ) , and the reward he gets for the effort ( how much he makes ) . These three things make up the basic DNA of manhood-the three accomplishments every man must achieve before he feels like he 's truly fulfilled his destiny as a man . And until he 's achieved his goal in those three areas , the man you 're dating , committed to , or married to will be too busy to focus on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy is born , the first thing everyone around him starts doing is telling him what he must do to be a real man . He is taught to be tough-to wrestle , climb , get up without crying , not let anyone push him around . He is taught to work hard-to do chores around the house , get the groceries out of the car , take out the trash , shovel the snow , cut the grass , and , as soon as he 's old enough , get a job . He is taught to protect-to watch out for his mother and his younger siblings , to watch over the house and the family 's property . And he is especially encouraged to uphold his family name-make something of himself so that when he walks in a room , everybody is clear about who he is , what he does , and how much he makes . Each of these things is taught in preparation for one thing : manhood . // The pursuit of manhood does n't change once a boy is grown . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and will remain on , who he is , what he does , and how much he makes until he feels like he 's achieved his mission . And until a man does these things , women only fit into the cracks of his life . He 's not thinking about settling down , having children , or building a home with anyone until he 's got all three of those things in sync . I 'm not saying that he has had to have made it , but at least he has to be on track to making it . // This is certainly how it worked for me . I 'll never forget how disappointed , frustrated , and unhappy I was when , in my early twenties , I was laid off from the Ford Motor Company . I was already a college dropout , and now , without a job , I hardly had enough money to take care of myself , much less a family . This left me unsure of my future-what I was going to do , how much I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The titles " college graduate " and " Ford inspector " were gone ; having no job pretty much meant that my chances of bringing home a good paycheck were zero ; and I had n't a clue how I was going to make money . It took me a while to find my footing . I dabbled in various jobs : I owned a carpet cleaning business ; I sold carpet ; I sold Amway products , the Dick Gregory Bahamian Diet , and ALW Insurance and Commonwealth Insurance . It was madness what I was doing to try to get my life together . Finding someone serious to settle down with was the absolute last thing on my mind . // Then , one night a woman for whom I used to write jokes encouraged me to go to a local comedy club and sign up for amateur night . See , I knew I was funny , and I made a few dollars-very few dollars-writing material for up-and-coming local comedians who were trying to find their way into the industry . But I had n't a clue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself . Still , this woman saw something in me and told me to take the stage . // So I did . And I killed . I won $50-which today may not seem like a lot of money , but when I was broke at that time , it felt like $5,000-for telling jokes . I also was guaranteed another fifty dollars if , as the winner , I opened the following week 's amateur night competition . The next day , I went to a printer and spent fifteen dollars of my winnings on business cards that , along with my phone number , read : Steve Harvey . Comedian . They were flat and flimsy and did n't have any raised lettering , but those business cards announced that I was Steve Harvey ( who I am ) , and that I had a special talent in comedy ( what I do ) . How much I was going to make remained to be seen , but at least I had the " who I am " and the " what I do " lined up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not chasing the " who we are , " the " what we do , " and the " how much we make , " we 're doomed . Dead . But the moment that we figure out the puzzle and feel like our dreams are taking shape , new life breathes into us-it makes us vibrant , enthuses , and animates us . From the moment I became a comedian , I stepped onto that stage ready to be the very best . // Even today , no matter how tired I am , no matter what is going on in my life , I am never late for work , and I 've never once missed a gig . Why ? Because when I wake up , my dream is in check ; I 'm living it out live and in color every day , whether it 's on the radio during the Steve Harvey Morning Show , or on television with my various projects , or onstage , during my Steve Harvey Live shows . Who I am is certain-I 'm Steve Harvey . What I do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in line with what I 've always wanted for my family and me. // ( Continues ... ) //
