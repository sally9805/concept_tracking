NISAN THE 9TH , THE JEWISH YEAR 3771 <br> Misty rain had been falling for two days and the dark mountaintop was cold and sweet with the fragrance of damp pine needles and wet earth . <br> Maryam drew her himation , a large square garment cut from white linen , over her head for warmth and stared down at the holy city of Yerushalaim . From up here , high on the Mount of Olives , the view was stunning . Starlight gilded the ancient stone walls and painted the wide streets . All was quiet and still . Even the tendrils of smoke that rose from the houses lay unmoving , like a dead black filigree spread upon the windless heavens . <br> Her gaze drifted to the Temple Mount . The trapezoidal platform of the Temple , supported by massive retaining walls that towered more than 50 cubits above the roadways , covered over 344,000 square cubits.2 It was twice as large as the monumental Forum Romanum , and more than three and a half times bigger than the combined temples of Jupiter and Astarte-Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , baths , mosaic courts , magnificently columned porticoes , and exquisite arches was unmatched in the world . And the Temple itself , the place where God lived , was awe-inspiring . The surface was covered with so much gold that when sunlight kissed it , it virtually blinded . Tonight , in the starlight , it was a shining silver bastion of light and dreams . <br> Maryam turned to the man seated on the angular limestone boulder to her left . Slender , with muscular shoulders , he was of medium height , and had shoulder-length black curly hair . The white himation over his head framed his bearded face and contrasted sharply with his dark glistening eyes . " This is dangerous , Yeshu . They are violent men . " <br> " We are all violent men , " he softly responded . <br> She stood for a time , deciding what to say , then sank down upon the rock beside him . The Mount of Olives was composed of limestone with a chalklike top layer . Despite the inhospitable soil , extensive olive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high points . After several anxious heartbeats , she whispered , " If word gets back to the praefectus , he will think you are conspiring  --  " <br> " I must speak with Dysmas . " <br> His tone silenced her . She looked away and ground her teeth beneath the tanned skin of her jaw . The knot of fear in her belly was pulling tighter , hindering her breathing . <br> " Maryam , please trust me . I know how this may appear to the Roman authorities , but it 's necessary . " <br> He leaned over and gently kissed her cheek , for it was by a kiss that the perfect , or those striving for perfection , conceived and gave birth . They received conception from the grace that lived in one another . <br> She fought to keep her voice from shaking when she answered , " It 's the Zealots I do n't trust . " <br> " They are from the Galil , as I am . They are friends of my friends , people I grew up with . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " <br> " But , why now ? " She lifted her hands in exasperation . " After Yohanan 's murder they tried to take you by force and make you a king . You ordered us to avoid the crowds because you feared they would ambush and capture you . What if they do it tonight ? " <br> " They wo n't . " <br> She lowered her hands and clenched them to fists . Only yesterday he had ordered his followers to buy swords . Though Yeshu taught that God , not humans , should exact vengeance , he was taking no chances with the Zealots , who hated the Romans and wanted to cleanse the land with their blood . <br> Or perhaps it is the Romans he fears . . . or the Temple priests , or the screaming crowds begging for a single glance from him . These days , we are surrounded by enemies . <br> Involuntarily , her gaze drifted to the north . Outside the city walls , she could see the fenced area that had been set up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thousands of tents had already been pitched . In all , there were three pilgrim camps around Yerushalaim : the one to the north , another to the west of the city , and a third south of the Siloam pool , in the Kidron valley . <br> Yeshu gave her an apologetic glance . " Forgive me for sounding stern . It 's just that I promised the Zealots I would meet them here at the ninth hour of night , Maryam , and I must keep my word . They are violent men , but they are also powerful men . With the two holy days coming , it is critical that we all understand each other . " <br> " Yes . Of course . I  --  I understand . " <br> In the valley below , a few oil lamps gleamed . She studied them longingly . After the killing exhaustion of the past few days , the press of the crowds , the shouts and cries , she yearned to be lying next to him , rolled in blankets , somewhere far out in the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask the question that had been plaguing her . " Yeshu , if . . . if you are still free to do so . . . will you enter Yerushalaim ? " <br> He smiled and bowed his head to stare at the damp ground . " You are the first to ask me directly . The others are either too frightened , or assume they already know the answer . The truth is I have n't decided yet . I must speak with Yosef Haramati first . " <br> Yosef Haramati , whose name literally meant " Yosef of the highlands , " was a member of the sacred Council of Seventy-one , and a secret friend . More and more of the Temple leaders had been expressing anxiety about Yeshu and his teachings . Yosef , despite the danger to himself and his family , would tell them what was being said behind closed doors . <br> " Are you worried about what the Seventy-one are planning ? " <br> " I am more worried about Rome , but the Council concerns me , yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite . I do n't understand why they hate you so . " She pulled her white himation tightly around her shoulders and shivered . <br> " Are you cold ? " He removed his own himation and started to drape it around her . <br> " No . " She held up a hand to stop him . " Keep it . I did n't shiver because of the night air . " <br> Compassion filled his dark starlit eyes . He hesitated a few long moments before saying , " We are all afraid , Maryam . Fear is the grist of the mill . " <br> As he slipped his himation over his shoulders again , he watched the light play in the olive trees that filled the Kidron valley . When the breeze shifted , the leaves shimmered , and the scent of freshly plowed fields came to them . <br> " The holy days may embolden them to take action against us , " Maryam whispered . Desperately , she added , " We could leave and return after Pesach . We have friends in Samaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would  --  " <br> " Maryam "  --  he reached over to stroke her hair  --  " do you remember , thirty-four years ago , when Praefectus Varus ordered two thousand men , underground fighters leading the rebellion against Rome , to be crucified in the mountains outside Yerushalaim ? " <br> She hesitated . " I recall hearing about it . Why ? " <br> The lowing of a cow drew her attention to the rolling hills north of Bet Ani where silver-bellied thunderclouds drifted across the sky . <br> " I was two years old , " Yeshu said , " but I saw them die , as did every other person in Yerushalaim that month . Rome wanted to make certain that we understood the price of rebellion . " He exhaled a breath that fogged in the cool air . " Then there was Yudah of the Galil . I was twelve when he was killed . " <br> Yudah had formed a sect called the Fourth Philosophy , comparing themselves with the Pharisees , Sadducees , and Essenes . They believed that Jews were required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quirinius , governor of Syria , ordered that a census be taken , Yudah proclaimed that only God had the right to number his people , and said that to submit to the census was to deny His Lordship . <br> Sadly , Yeshu said , " I remember Yudah standing on the shore of the Jordan , shouting that God would deliver His people only when they rose up in armed rebellion against Rome . It took Yudah two days to die . It was terrible , not just for me , but for everyone in the Galil . He had been one of our greatest heroes . " <br> A whisper of pine-sharp wind meandered across the mountaintop . He pulled his himation more tightly around his shoulders . <br> Maryam studied his troubled expression . " Why did you ask me about Yudah and the two thousand ? " <br> " Because Zealots have paid terribly in the past for their unwavering faith in God . The least they deserve from me is to be heard . " <br> " But , Master , please consider waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> He put a hand on her wrist to quiet her . <br> Footsteps , soft and carefully placed , sounded on the slope below them . <br> Ten heartbeats later she saw the black silhouettes of two men . One was tall and thin , the other short , but very muscular . <br> Yeshu rose to his feet , preparing himself for the confrontation . <br> When they came to within three paces , Yeshu called , " Dysmas , Gestas , welcome . Please sit with me . " He gestured to the rocks that thrust up from the hillside to his right . <br> Dysmas stopped two paces away , but remained standing . His brown himation hung around his skinny frame in tattered , dirty folds . He had a lean face with dark pits for eyes , and long black hair hung over his shoulders . " Magician , you surprise me . I did n't expect you to be here . " <br> Yeshu dipped his head . " How may I serve you ? " <br> Dysmas had the distinctive accent of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . He had often been accused of being a Zealot because of his accent . The Zealot movement had started in the Galil with Yudah and most of its members continued to come from there . <br> Gestas stopped beside Dysmas and spread his feet as though bracing himself for a long night . He had a pockmarked face with a squashed nose , probably broken in one too many brawls , and brown hair . <br> Dysmas looked at Maryam . " Why is she here ? " <br> " Maryam is my companion and adviser . " <br> Dysmas looked her up and down , clearly disturbed that a woman would dare to attend a political meeting , but he wisely turned to Yeshu . " That leper spread the news far and wide , did n't he ? " <br> Yeshu smiled , but cocked his head . " Is that why you 're here ? To discuss my healings ? " <br> " We 're here because we 've seen the thousands who gather to hear you preach every day . We know that before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even enter a town , but had to remain in the countryside for safety . Even then , the sick and those possessed by demons ran to you from every corner . It is said that some came from as far away as Sidon . " <br> Yeshu answered simply , " As you have come . Are you also in need of healing ? " <br> The Zealots ' unblinking eyes reflected the starlight like silver shields , and Maryam could tell from their stony expressions that they were irritated by his question . <br> Dysmas said , " I do n't need any of your magic potions or spells . We 're here to learn your plans for Pesach . " He took a step forward and leaned toward Yeshu to whisper , " Do you truly wish to destroy the Temple and sweep away the corruption ? I 've heard you say it . If you mean to try to fulfill the prophecies , let us help you . " <br> The man 's face resembled a weasel 's , predatory , waiting for the slightest hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your help , Dysmas , if I thought our goals were the same . I 'm not sure they are . " <br> " You preach loudly against the corruption and immorality that infects the priests like a deadly rot . We agree with you . It must be stopped . " <br> Yeshu quietly frowned at the ground . " Dysmas , it is true that many members of the priesthood , as well as the ruling class , have adopted evil , licentious ways . They tax the poor until they can not afford to buy bread and spend the spoils for silk sashes to bind their waists . Injustice is rampant . It sickens me , but violence is not the solution . " <br> " We must cast off the yoke of Rome and get our nation back ! The holy books say that the mashiah will conquer the enemies of Yisrael and restore our nation . Are you the promised redeemer or not ? " <br> Yeshu hesitated . <br> Maryam 's eyes jerked to him . He had never said it . At least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke up : " Magician , we have five thousand men ready to attack . With you as our leader , the general populace will flock behind our soldiers with whatever weapons they can grab from their fields or labors . God is sure to see our hearts and rush to our aid . Not even the Romans can withstand  --  " <br> " Who is your leader ? " <br> Dysmas and Gestas exchanged a glance , then Dysmas replied , " He calls himself the ' Son of the Father , ' in much the same way you call yourself the ' Son of Man . ' You are both God 's prophets who , if you work together , will conquer our enemies and lead Yisrael back to its glory . " <br> Yeshu took a deep breath and let it out slowly . He must have been thinking , as Maryam was , that they had gotten down to their true reasons for the meeting much more quickly than he 'd thought they would . <br> " Brothers , are you not afraid that such a move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nation ? " <br> " Oh , they 'll try ; but if we join forces , our nation will , as one , stand up and fight . They can not kill us all . " <br> Maryam made a small , frightened sound and protectively folded her arms across her chest . Just above a whisper , she urged , " Do not listen to them , Master . The Romans can and will kill us all . They have proven it many times . " <br> Dysmas glared at her . To Yeshu , he said , " What do women know of battle ? Nothing . Less than nothing . " <br> " And you , Dysmas , have you seen battle ? What about you , Gestas ? " <br> Both men straightened , as though offended . <br> Dysmas replied , " We served as part of the Temple police . While we 've never been in war , we 've seen our share of fighting . We 've also seen the bribery , fraud , and vice that go on in the Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaiaphas is the handmaiden of the praefectus ! You know it as well as we do . The fool laps the milk of life from a Roman bowl . And it costs us all a pretty sum ! " <br> The " sum " he referred to was the fee that high priests had to pay to remain in office . High priests were Roman nominees , responsible to Roman authority , and removable by the Romans if they did not pay what the praefectus demanded . The sum provided a lucrative source of private income for anyone who served as praefectus . This fact did not make high priests particularly popular with the average person , especially since they charged " temple fees " to help cover the costs . <br> Yeshu squinted at the rocky hillside . Somewhere in the distance a dog barked , and it stirred every other dog in hearing to yip and howl , serenading the night with a melodious chorus . <br> In his deep , teaching voice , he said , " Dysmas , I have heard with my own ears the trumpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my own eyes the great turmoil that results . I beg you not to do this . Listen to me , and you will be clothed in light and a chariot will bear you aloft . Ignore my words , and this world will pass away before you are prepared . " <br> " We did n't come here to be preached at , Magician ! We came to learn your Pesach plans . Will you challenge the Seventy-one , or not ? " <br> Maryam 's belly muscles went tight . She looked straight at him , waiting for him to say " no , " as he must . Yeshu had subtly been challenging the Council for many months , openly healing on Shabbat , taking food and drink with sinners . But to lead a revolt against them , and by extension Rome , as Yudah of the Galil had done ? Horrifying images of gaunt , crucified men with their dead faces twisted in agony filled her thoughts . Maryam rose to her feet , and said , " They need a sacrificial lamb , Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too cowardly to do it themselves . Let 's go . " <br> Rage contorted Dysmas ' face . " Best tell your whore to keep her mouth shut , Magician . She 's very close to  --  " <br> " To me , " Yeshu interrupted . " She 's very close to me . As I wish you were . " He extended one hand to Dysmas and the other to Gestas . " Now , this instant , I challenge you to take my hands and follow me into the lightthat is to come . " <br> Gestas vented an ugly laugh , and said , " You constantly speak about salvation . How is it possible you do not know that chasing the Romans from our land is the only way to truly save our people ? " <br> Yeshu left his hands out while he mildly said , " I warn you , brothers , resistance can only lead to social and military disaster for our people . Do not take this path . Very soon , God Almighty will renew his covenant with Yisrael and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to preach at us ! " Dysmas shouted and it echoed over the rolling hills . The dogs started barking again . <br> Yeshu slowly pulled his hands back . Dysmas and Gestas had their jaws clenched . <br> Maryam moved closer to his side . If they attacked him , she would tear them apart with her bare hands . <br> Yeshu softly said , " You Zealots remind me of the rich merchant who discovered a beautiful pearl and sold everything he owned to buy it . He clutched that pearl to his chest , forsaking all other things , even food and drink , even his family . Too late did he discover that his treasure brought him only pain and death . " <br> Both men shifted , fists balled in anger . Maryam wondered if they understood that their dream of conquering Rome was the pearl . <br> " So , " Dysmas said , " you will not join forces with us ? " <br> " I am already joined with you in the divine light , brothers . Let that be enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He 's a Roman stooge just like the high priest . That 's why he told us to pay their taxes . Give unto Caesar ! I spit upon Caesar ! " <br> Dysmas fixed Yeshu with a hard eye . " I ask you one last time to tell us plainly if you are with us or against us . " <br> The night breeze tousled the old grass on the hillside and created a soft hissing sound . <br> " I am against no man , Dysmas . We are all One in the Kingdom . I will pray for you . " <br> " We 're wasting our time , " Gestas said , raising his hands in frustration . " Let 's go and tell the Son of the Father that the Magician refuses to help us . " <br> Dysmas lowered his hand to his belted dagger . " He will be very displeased . Perhaps you should think this over . " <br> Yeshu shook his head . " No , I do n't need to . " <br> " Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and both Zealots turned and tramped away down the hill . He watched them until they disappeared into the dark shadows of the olive trees . <br> " The fools , " Maryam said in a shaking voice . " Why do they persecute you ? This world is about to end ! They should be tending to their own souls , not rousing the people to fight Rome . " <br> " Do n't hate them , Maryam . They are blind in their hearts . For the moment they are intoxicated , but they will leave this earth empty men . If you do not wish to suffer the same fate , you must become a passerby . " <br> " A passerby ? Do n't joke . After tonight , they 'll be working against us , maybe even plotting to kill us . I 'm angry . You should be , too . " <br> " Perhaps . " He smiled at her . " But only a calm pond reflects the light of the Kingdom . " <br> Her enraged expression slackened . She closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to them for baptism when the light of the Kingdom shone in their eyes and on their faces . <br> She said , " Forgive me , Master . I seem to forget your teachings at the moments I need them most . I am ashamed of myself . " <br> " Do n't be . You are tired , as I am . Let 's . . . " <br> Down in the olive trees , voices rose . Only then did she realize that a Zealot camp hid there . Maryam 's eyes jerked wide and riveted on the spot . <br> " Blessed God , that 's why Dysmas chose this meeting place , " she hissed . " How many men do you think he brought with him ? All five thousand ? " <br> Yeshu 's brows drew together . " I do n't know , but let 's go . " He put a hand on her shoulder . " It 's not wise to dally here . Besides , I 'm sure the others are awake and longing to hear what happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her family 's home in Bet Ani , but she could not help glancing over her shoulder often to make certain they were not being followed . <br> They walked the entire way in silence . He seemed lost in his thoughts , but Maryam was listening for footsteps behind them . Around every bend , she expected to be ambushed by an angry horde . <br> When they finally reached her home , her nerves were strung so tight , she said , " You go in , Master . I  --  I need to remain out here in the cool air for a while . " <br> He touched her hair gently , said , " Do n't be long , " and walked to the door . When it closed behind him and she heard the voices of the other disciples rise , bombarding him with questions , Maryam could stand it no longer . <br> She staggered to the side of the road and vomited until there was nothing left to heave , until her belly shredded and caught in her throat , and the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , she just listened to her own breathing . <br> It took a quarter hour , but when she could , she wiped her mouth on the corner of her himation , and straightened her clothing . <br> He needed her now more than he had ever needed her in his life . She sucked in a deep , fortifying breath , and strode for the house to stand at his shoulder . <br> Excerpted from THE BETRAYAL by Kathleen O'Neal Gear and W.
