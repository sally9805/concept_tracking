Chapter One April 11 , 1893. 5:25 A.M. Max Greengrass pushed himself away from the faro table . All night the layout , thirteen spades glued onto an enameled tablecloth , had mesmerized him , but now it was time to cash in . For once he was ahead , four dollars and thirty-seven cents to be precise . His lungs felt sticky with cigar smoke . He had to stretch his legs . Out on Perry Street he could breathe again . He loved the last moments before the sun came up , the street lamps going pale , the cool air blowing off the river , the solitude . Searching for one last fare , a fly cab prowled Bleecker Street . The hollow sound of hooves on paving stone echoed in the stillness . As he walked , the luminous gray light intensified , wrapping him in its subtle glow . He jingled the coins in his pocket . Life was n't half-bad . He 'd slip a buck to his mother-his father had a religious allergy to work-and another to his sister Faye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Soothing Syrup , but she claimed various mysterious pains , especially after doing three shows a day , and he hated to go hard on her . Barely watching where he was going , he had to skip sideways to avoid stepping on them . Four dead cats laid out in a perfect row in front of a dusty Waverly Place building . He recoiled , his throat closing up in disgust . Then he stepped back and wondered . Why had the creatures been so carefully arranged ? Was there anything to it ? A space-rater at The New York Herald-he was paid by the column inch-Max could n't afford to pass up any story , even the least likely . He had already scrambled for pennies at The Brooklyn Eagle , The Tribune and The World , but the best stories , and a full-time position , had somehow eluded him . He could n't figure it out . It was n't any one thing . At the Trib he 'd gotten into it with an editor named Burgundy-Jones , a high hat bastard if there ever was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days on a bender . At The Eagle some toff from Columbia showed up out of the blue , and before Max knew it he was being eased out . Max was n't reflective , but once in a while a terrible thought would creep into his mind . He was getting older . In February he 'd turned twenty-five . What would he do if he never found a secure spot in the newspaper business ? This fear would flash white across his mind , paralyzing him for a second , but then he would find fresh material , he would lose himself and forget the terror completely . The feline corpses at his feet intrigued him . Sitting on a nearby stoop , he gazed at the dead animals , trying to decide if he could squeeze two hundred words out of their demise . A man with ginger-colored muttonchops emerged from the parlor house next door . At the top step the sack-suited businessman straightened his tie and plunged onto the sidewalk , stepping blindly onto one of the furry victims . Staggering , he cursed under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust , he glanced down and muttered one more imprecation before marching off towards Sixth Avenue . Max wondered if he should chase the sportsman . To flesh out an article , he would need quotes . He 'd quit the faro bank with money in his pocket , he 'd avoided the bow-bow wine-a raw brandy the management offered gratis-and now he had the price of something better at Fitzgerald and Ives 's around the corner . But he moved up the steps into the deeper shadows , watching and wondering . A few minutes later Mrs. Jabonne , in a brilliant black and red kimono , threw open her door and looked up and down the street . Shrugging , she set a dish of milk on the top step . Then she caught sight of the crime scene . Barefoot , she rushed outside , lifted a beribboned white cat into her arms and let out a wail . Max knew her . He had visited her establishment several times , but had left with mixed feelings . She ran a nice house with clean girls , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She claimed they had n't had a dose yet . Such small bones , such pure , unblemished skin . He hesitated . Pressing himself into the shadows , he watched her hug the soft animal to her breast and take a few steps back . Then she thought better of it . Looking both ways down Waverly Place , she dropped her former pet back onto the sidewalk before anyone could catch her . Max pushed off . Mrs. Jabonne marched into Fitzgerald and Ives wearing a black skirt , an immaculate blouse with flashing pearl buttons and a cape of deep purple . " Hey , Minnie , " Schreiber said , barely looking up from his beer . Taking a wide stance in the middle of the floor , Mrs. Jabonne replied , " They 're killing cats now . Up and down . They murdered my Sally . While you 're drinking yourselves blind , some crank 's getting his satisfaction . " " Wadda we look like , the god-damned ASPCA ? " Schreiber snapped . Mrs. Jabonne did n't back down . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't there a law ? " " I 'd say lay off the hop , " Schreiber answered , winking at his companions . Max wondered . He might be able to make something out of it after all . So far his longest Herald article involved a riot at a St. Marks Place wedding-the bride 's side had tried to charge the groom 's relations for drinks . " I 'll take a look , and if I need you boys to keep the peace , I 'll call you , " Max offered . " Who put you on the force ? " Schreiber demanded . Soon Max and Officer Schreiber were trooping after Mrs. Jabonne to view the great cat massacre . Out of the corner of his mouth , Schreiber half-whispered , " She 's loaded . They say she 's got property all over Brooklyn Heights . " When they reached Mrs. Jabonne 's , a guttersnipe in overalls and a rag of a shirt was balancing himself on the iron fence . Max noticed the way the boy 's bare toes gripped the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around like that , even when it got ice cold ? When he spied Officer Schreiber the kid leaped off the fence and took several steps back , his eyes darting towards the closest alley . Maybe he was the one who had broken the necks of the creatures littering the sidewalk , maybe he was looking for a handout to finger some other guttersnipe . The one thing Max liked , the thing he thought might sell the article to Parnell , was the way the four cats had been lined up , their evenly spaced tails telling an obscure story . Max picked a black and white tabby up by the scruff of its neck and examined it carefully , but why it had died remained a mystery to him . There was n't a single mark on the well-fed animal . Before the boy could get a word out , Schreiber flew at the scrawny kid , flailing with his nightstick . " You murdering little bastard , " he swore , aiming a full swing at the guttersnipe 's head . " I 'll fan ya ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grabbing at the towering cop . In a flash the boy took off across the street , hopped a plank wall and pressed himself into a black sliver of darkness between two buildings . The snaky little bastards could get in anywhere . Cellars . Warehouses . Litters of them slept under wagons parked along the North River piers . And there were as many of them as there were cats , screeching insults , grabbing from carts left and right , setting bonfires , sleeping in old sewer pipes , in nests on the hay barges . On Printing House Square they curled up on sidewalk grates to catch the steam from the booming presses below . All winter he 'd seen them in stairwells , passed out in mewling piles , bottles of blue ruin scattered round them . Ruefully , Max watched his story disappear . Then he wondered if the little rat might pop up around the corner . Without another word he started running , too , slipping in the ankle-deep horse muck along the curb , flailing , barely keeping his balance on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
