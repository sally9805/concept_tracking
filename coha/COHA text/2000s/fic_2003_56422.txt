HE HAD BEEN RAISED IN THE impossibly tall asteroid forests of Ebb , flitting between crystalline trees on invisible wings while the Galactic Core seared the skies above him . Years later , firing at a line of redcoats or hunting with his pride on the plains of New Africa , he could still feel phantom tinglings from those wings in the moments before sleep , though they had long since been abandoned in favor of less juvenile forms . And yet often he realdreamed of drifting through a million scintillating branches , the only sound his racing heart . <p> Now , Ebb was only a memory , lost in the gulf between Shutdown and Retrovival . He had moved from world to world since his father 's death , never claiming a home , just another flitboy on the fringe of the new . He was there when Zor opened , racing through its ultragreen planetoids in old-style jetplanes . He was first through the portal to Atlantis 2 , swimming gracefully through the city while the rest of the newbies were just flexing their gills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to multiBe , another ghost looking for the next big thing , sampling lights and colors and sounds and tastes from other worlds while his avatar became vacant and listless . <p> His father had named him Tamor , in the style of Ebb . He had hated it once he 'd grown old enough to realize it tied him to a single , clichd world . In his teens he had registered the truename Dez'Plx+0K , though he used it less and less as he matured . Now , he had let it lapse , and he had no truename , his moniker changing with his body in each new world he entered . He disliked truenames and distrusted those who bore them . A truename implied a true self , and he did not believe one existed . <p> It was in the royal court of Kae'Sli when he first met her . He had taken the form of a mysterious older baron from an obscure island state , politicking with the dukes and baronesses , trading gossip and news : though he had visited Kae'Sli several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveled in the banalities of court gossip and political backstabbing , but such nonsense bored him , occupying only part of his attention as he multiWent elsewhere . <p> Today he was focusing more or less entirely on the court . His avatar of a sunfish swimming through the garden-pools of Zen Prime , though relaxing , occupied little of his mental energies . Web-born could multiBe three or four places at once , but growing up on Ebb alone had kept his mind from fragmenting well , though not for lack of trying . <p> " Perdon , " he heard , as a soft hand touched him on the shoulder . He turned . <p> She was wearing a radish-green dress with a crystal turban , somewhere above the height of current Kae'Sli fashion . Her avatar was attractive , like most of the ones in the room , but not to the inordinate extent of one seeking only sex . <p> " Su ? " he vocalized . <p> " Quer , meseek accomp to Regula . You ? " <p> He activated the enterface and lookupped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no truename and hence , no history . <p> It was abrupt , to be sure , but Kae'Sli was already growing old and he had never Been in Regula . On Zen Prime , he darted playfully through a warm current . <p> " Su , " he smiled , and held out his hand . She smiled back , and took it . <p> For years he had lived and breathed the gamezones , racing , puzzling , fighting , killing for fleeting fame , along with millions of others . But he tired of the false victory and false defeat , and drifted toward more dangerous pursuits . He visited punishment worlds . He simmed pain . Once he met some zonehackers , and Was with them long enough to see one realkilled by an enforcer . He severed his connection to that world and never returned . <p> Now , he flitted . He was already near the age when his father had settled down , had homelanded on Ebb , never to leave . His father had loved Ebb , and had tried to instill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . But long before he was no longer Tamor , the boy could not imagine loving any single world enough to be exiled there , cut off from the infinite possibilities that awaited him through the Exit link . <p> He had never been interested in mating , the frighteningly random and tedious process by which he had been created . Far more appealing was the art of programming artificial life for a new world , for a companion , or as a pseudotar to release into the web , a free being . But he had never been willing to invest the time it took to learn such skills . <p> Nor was he interested in the ways most passed their time . He despised the sexers , flitting from orgasm to orgasm on six worlds at a time , multiFucking whenever they were n't asleep . Neither was he interested in the Sportworlds , with their racing , gambling , and gladiatorial combat . The dreamers bored him , living in worlds without cause and effect , without consequence or reason , and the celibors frightened him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most eventually found a little nook they could Be in , and would homeland or at least return there often enough to be pseudohomelanders . Most became content , complacent , stagnant in their chosen world , while they waited to realdie . <p> But some , like him , did not . <p> On Regula you became a being of pure energy , which made avatar creation unnecessary . So , while they waited to Enter , he lookupped the backstory . The Regulans had once had a technologically advanced civilization , before they had transcended their physical forms to become brilliant points of light whose color shifted with mood and environment . Now , they drifted through the tall spires of their abandoned cities and sculpted landscapes , collaborating on freeform works of art , massive holograms floating in canyons or above cityscapes , constantly shifting in structure and theme as artists joined and left the work . It was pure masturbatory nonsense . <p> But he humored her , following her scintillating form from one street to another until they found a new creation , phased light crawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dozen or so Regulans . They joined the artists , and to his surprise he found himself enjoying the work , waking up old creative urges that had n't been utilized in years . He felt her manipulations clearly over the listless noise of the others , and could tell that she felt his . Before long they were dominating the work , creating bold new structures and radical color schemes , molding the throbbing light waves around and around the tower , endlessly . <p> They sexed in a vertical cathedral , sterile and abandoned . On Regula it was brilliant , piercing , the energies of each avatar sparking and twisting together and around each other like liquid lightning . <p> It was only afterward that he realized his sunfish on Zen Prime had expired . He had forgotten to breathe . <p> THOUGH THE SPECIFIC day he first got the idea to link to Reality was uncertain , he knew he had been wandering through the Library , an unnecessary and poorly made interface to netdata , pulling random books off shelves and skimming through them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers to questions he could not even come close to phrasing . <p> He knew about Reality , of course . Everyone did . It was the prison that mankind had been born into , a Hell of unbending rules , unchanging forms , and unhappy people , slaves to the constant needs of their physical bodies . The human race had escaped it , sometime before his father was born , and had never looked back . He had assumed , along with the rest of his generation , that the link had been severed long ago . <p> But as he skimmed through volumes of esoterica about the inner workings of the enterface , he discovered an old command that would do the unthinkable : shut down all your neural connections to virtuality , disconnect you , eject you , and somehow return you , impossibly , to Reality . <p> It was a horrifying concept , and he started to put the book back on the shelf . But the idea gripped hold of him with a sudden thrill , and in that instant he realized that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Be somewhere fundamentally different than the endless multitude of worlds and forms soon , he would eventually find the carefully guarded portal labeled Self-Termination and activate it . <p> As he stood there , holding the ancient tome in his hand , he realized that this had the potential to be far more interesting . <p> She was his muse , his passion , his god . He followed her from world to world , through an endless parade of forms . She fascinated him in a way nothing before ever had . For the first time in years , he felt no desire to multiGo elsewhere , and he focused all his attention on whatever world they occupied together . Perhaps it was the fragility of the relationship ... with no truenames , either of them could leave at any instant , with no chance of ever being found by the other . He was often seized by an irrational fear she was about to do just that , that each beguiling smile would be the last , that each new coupling would be remembered like the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time she spoke the name of a new world , when he Went there she 'd always be waiting . And it was always she who decided  --  for no reason he could discern  --  to go . They would be at a banquet , or cresting a phantridge , or sculpting clouds when she would announce their imminent departure . He did n't mind . He was intoxicated by her . He would have followed her anywhere . <p> Most of the time they did n't speak , even when their forms allowed them to . But once , in a lavish gondola floating down the Nile , his curiosity became too intense to ignore . <p> They were again playing the game of wealthy nobles , though this time in the more interesting world of Ancient Egypt . The high priests of Amn were invading , and he had played a powerful sorcerer defending his pharaoh , she his brave courtesan . Now they drifted back to the palace , attended by loyal servants unfailing in their pre-programmed devotion . <p> He gazed down at her smooth dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Where did you come from ? he said , and his form spoke " Tashiach di khalesh ? " She smiled , dreamily , one hand dipped in the cool river . <p> " Al maat tshaleh ku shichueke ta , " she said languidly . The enterface told him it meant Somewhere beyond your comprehension . <p> The gondola drifted on as the river sparkled in the light of the low , red sun . <p> WEEKS OF DELIBERATION followed the discovery . He had pulled up the Eject command , and there it sat , just as described , looking as innocuous as any other portal . Only this world would have no rules , no codes , no backstory . This was different . <p> He scanned through old data tomes and discovered hints of a time when people moved back and forth between the two realities  --  virtual and real . He learned a bit about how his universe actually worked , knowledge that had dimly accumulated in his mind now given focus and specificity . He saw how the gray matter of his brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body was kept alive through a food drip , how the muscles were electrically stimulated to be ready for use if their owner needed them . <p> Was it all really there ? Did it still exist ? It all seemed so incredibly tenuous , like a poorly written dream . He could hardly believe that he could Be somewhere and have no knowledge of it . And there was fear , too  --  what would happen if he triggered the portal and nothing was there ? The systems had been in place , years before , but there was no way to know if they still functioned . <p> He knew that he had been born , somehow , but his earliest memories were of Ebb . How a physical being had come into existence from the virtual coupling of his parents was a mystery to him . He dug deep through the archives and found strange , old words . Insemination . Biomation . He understood little and believed less . There was no proof of any of this , nothing he could see , feel , touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before , must somehow have devised a way to migrate completely into the virtual realm . But if such a change had taken place , he thought uneasily , would n't the Eject command have been deleted ? <p> The portal remained , taunting him . It must lead somewhere . It might be suicide . It might be insane . But  --  it would Be . Really Be . <p> The way nothing he 'd ever experienced was or ever would be . <p> Abruptly , he decided . Before he had time to reconsider , he triggered the portal , and was ejected into Reality . <p> Soon their pace increased , and there would be less and less time spent in each world before she would announce that they were leaving for a new one . So it came as a surprise when they spent a whole day in a period American South sim , relaxing in the cool fall air on a rustic plantation , dancing in the evening in a quaint ballroom filled with other visitors . <p> She was wearing a pale pink dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Hers were a brilliant green . <p> They danced to old tonal music along with a crowd of others . The party was hosted by an aged homelander , who had spent years recreating the plantation from ancient records . The world was so formulaic it would have been embarrassing in any other context , but in her presence he never seemed to mind , gaining a fresh perspective that made even the most tired worlds seem invigorating . <p> The dance ended , and he held her close , breathing in the peculiar scent of her long , flowing hair . He was happy  --  inexplicably , unconditionally happy . <p> " I have a secret , " she whispered in the sim 's drawn-out dialect . " Would you like to hear it ? " <p> He pulled back and gazed at her , surprised . " Yes , " he said , simply . She eyed him coyly . " I 'm not like you . " He gazed back , perplexed . She leaned forward to whisper in his ear , " I 'm from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pains . A yawning sensation of emptiness . A strange smell , unpleasant . Stabbing gray light . A greasy smoothness pressing into his back . A hum , persistent , annoying , coming from somewhere nearby . <p> He had arrived . This was Reality . Slowly , unsteadily , he sat up . The room was cold ; sputtering fluorescent lights dimly illuminated the bare concrete walls . He rubbed his eyes . They were n't focusing properly , and the artificial light stabbed into them like needles . He waited for a moment to see if he would feel better . The moment passed . <p> He tried to get his bearings , unsuccessfully . This is real , he thought , this is real . His hands clenched the warm vinyl beneath him . This is real . But it did n't sink in , it did n't have any impact . He could n't make himself believe it was anything but an unpleasant world he was simming while searching for a new one to flit to . <p> Carefully , he began removing his attachments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records : mind link , tugging gently on his bald skull before letting go ; catheter , food drip , muscle tensors , medstat . He draped them all over a nearby hook , then slowly stood to his feet , swaying , unsteady . <p> Weight pressed him : it had been a long time since he 'd simmed a full G world in human form . But it was no more than an annoyance  --  his muscles had been kept in prime condition . All for this moment , he thought idly , probably the only time I 'll ever use them . <p> As his eyes turned to the rest of the small room , he started as he realized he was n't alone . The room was jammed with other tables , and on each lay a form , humans in simple gowns with gray , flaky skin , sagging flesh , bedsores , expressions of stupor . <p> A thought grew in the back of his mind , vaguely terrible and portentous . He tried to shake it off , but it persisted , just out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he glanced down at his own gown that it hit him . <p> This was no avatar , no form . This was him . This was his self  --  his trueself . <p> He stared into her eyes as a shudder passed through his body . " You should n't joke about such things , " he said with a sudden harshness . <p> " But it is not a joke , " she said , wide-eyed . " I was born in a city called Paris . " <p> " Paris is a subworld , " he responded quickly , " I Went there once , years ago . " <p> She stared up at him with a hint of a smile . " No , " she breathed , " I mean the real Paris . " <p> He looked down at her , stunned . She smiled openly , now , waiting for him to make the next move . The band began playing a waltz , and forms began dancing around them , merrily . <p> " But there is n't anyone in Reality anymore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . " <p> " Why , not at all ! " she said playfully . " In fact , the real people vastly outnumber the virtual ones . It 's just that you forgot all about us , though we never forgot about you . " <p> She grabbed his hand and started moving her feet to the waltz . He blindly followed , his mind still struggling to comprehend what she was saying . <p> " We realized one day , " she continued conspiratorially , as if describing a particularly interesting portal , " that you were all long gone , that the numbers that ran our world meant nothing without you there to enforce them . We realized what we could do with the technology and energy used to run your dream worlds . And we realized how powerless , completely and absolutely powerless you were to stop us from taking them . " <p> She twirled him around the dance floor , gazing up at him with giddy glee . <p> " We mean to kill you all , " she whispered . <p> HE TRIED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before remembering he had no enterface . If he wanted to find out what he looked like , he 'd have to find a more primitive representation . A glance confirmed what he 'd suspected : the room was unadorned , except for the beds and their disquieting occupants . He focused his attention on a small gray door . <p> He reached it and staggered through . His muscles did n't seem to work quite right  --  there was a lag , a gap between his orders to move and their compliance , what seemed an almost reluctant compliance . Stumbling into a dim hallway , he shivered in a cold draft that ran along it . <p> The hall stretched beyond the ability of his maddeningly unfocused eyes to see . Small blue-gray doors receded into infinity , each apparently identical to the last . There was no reason to take a single step in either direction , to risk losing his room and the link back to his reality . Except  --  some ten paces down  --  was that a window ? <p> Lurching , struggling with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small dark rectangle  --  only blackness outside , perhaps night  --  and stopped before it . His eyes slowly racked into focus on the shape reflected back at him . The moment they finally did was burned into his memory with an intensity greater than any Playback . <p> Reflected in the surface before him was a man with a slight gray body . The puffy eyes and sallow skin were expected , though still a shock to see . It was the facial features that stopped him cold . A hooked nose . Large forehead . Small , beady eyes . Thin ears . <p> Though he had n't known what to expect , he had nevertheless expected something . His subconscious had prepared for a spark of recognition , of familiarity , of identity . <p> This was a stranger . <p> He raised his hand toward the mirror and the stranger did also . <p> A wave of nausea washed over him as he staggered back , eyes locked with the identical pair in the dark reflection . This is you , a merciless voice taunted , prancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The cracking walls seemed to close around him . He gasped for air , inhaling dry , rotten lungfuls rapidly . <p> He wanted to rip this strange body off , this unfamiliar face that stared back at him in horror , grasp the flesh and tear it until a shimmering faerie emerged , or a muscled Neoman . This body , this hideous unchangeable container for his mind , repulsed him . What did you expect ? the voice taunted , and in a flash of sudden insight he realized he 'd expected his childhood form from Ebb , gossamer wings sprouting from his back after all these years . <p> Old medical diagrams he 'd seen in his research bubbled to the surface of his memory : images of slimy organs churning around inside him , a throbbing heart pumping thick , warm blood through his veins . <p> A wave of cold sickness spread over him . He convulsed violently , bending forward and breaking his death gaze with the stranger . Green liquid erupted from his mouth , burning his throat , burning his nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside he screamed . <p> He ripped away from her arms and staggered back , bumping some of the other dancers who flashed him looks of annoyance . He stared at her in horror as she stood there , smiling in her pretty pink gown , and tried to understand why he still loved her so much . <p> " What are you talking about ? " he shouted . " Why should you want to kill us ? " <p> Her smile widened . " This might be hard for you to grasp , " she teased , " living here in your paradise , so distant from reality  --  " <p> " I 've been to Reality , " he choked , the memories flooding back in a sudden flash , " I 've Been there . " <p> " Have you ? " her eyes widened , her prepared speech momentarily derailed , " Have you indeed ? " <p> She looked into his face . He stared back in remembered horror . <p> " Yes , perhaps you have , " she murmured . <p> Stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were there , " she said softly , " I wonder if you stopped to consider where all you saw came from ? You ca n't just dream things in reality , you know . People have to build them . Did you wonder where that immersion table came from ? Who paid for the electricity to run your systems ? Hmm ? " Her Southern drawl teased him , taunted with barely concealed contempt . <p> His mind whirled . " I  --  I did n't really  --  " <p> " Of course you did n't , " she said smoothly , " none of you have . " <p> He pushed her back in a flash of sudden anger . " And why should we ? " he shouted , " Why should we care about you ? You mean nothing to us ! " <p> The dancers were stopping , staring at the spectacle . The musicians , who were just part of the sim , played on . <p> Oblivious to the stares , or perhaps invigorated by them , she spoke slowly , deliberately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very wealthy man in Reality . He made it possible through a trust fund for his heirs to live comfortably in VR , indefinitely . My grandfather and great-grandfather were paid a small part of this sum to take care of your bodies , to feed the machines you lived in , to run the plants that powered them . " <p> She turned her head now to the gathered crowd , confused , scoffing , worried . " It did n't cost much . As the wealthy all departed for their virtual paradise , the economy slowly collapsed , and we had to take whatever work was left . And soon , there was really only one kind of work left to do . " <p> He stared at her , hypnotized by her voice , her eyes , her body , struggling to understand what she was saying . <p> " Your economists had it all figured out , " she continued , " all down to the last decimal place . They had already spent too long outside of Reality , lost in abstractions , to recognize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would keep running for all eternity . " She smiled thinly . " But it wo n't . " <p> Words found their way to his form 's lips . " Why are you telling me this ? " <p> She looked at him with an expression that was almost pity . Slowly , she stepped back up to him , lifted a hand to his cheek , caressed it . " We hacked into your mind , " she said gently , " programmed you to love me with the innocence and intensity of a school boy . Then I led you from world to world , one for each server , staying long enough for our virus to completely infect each one . Very soon now , it will activate , and you will all be Ejected , permanently . " <p> HE COLLAPSED backward , crawling back toward the door in a panic . Something was wrong with his body , he thought dully , it was n't responding correctly at all . The image of the small , innocent-looking Exit link bounced sickeningly through his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterface and delete it : sever the last link between mankind and its ugly biological past . " Real " was a dirty word already in some worlds ; eventually it would become taboo . The few worlds that taught history would be destroyed , the records lost ; mankind , in all its beautiful , multi-formed , virtual splendor would be free from the horror of flesh . <p> People were screaming . Many had disappeared , flitting away like scared insects , while others took on a glazed , panicked look as they multiWent elsewhere to try to find some reassurance that this was all a joke , a new horrorsim that they 'd accidentally Gone to . <p> She ignored them , and kept her eyes locked on his . " Most of your ancestors opted not to pay for muscular maintenance , " she said , " so most of you will die within hours . The rest will be back in Reality , along with me . " She took a satisfied breath . " I 'm going home . " <p> His mind reeled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only word that finally made it to the lips of his form , first in a scream , then in a series of stunned , pathetic moans . <p> For a moment , she seemed to soften . " You 'll live , " she said , " if you 've been to Reality before you 'll live . You 're one of the lucky ones . It wo n't be as bad as you think . " <p> Traces of remembered nausea gripped his body , and he struggled to vocalize . The enterface did its best to translate his ramblings into the dialect of a polite Southern gentleman . " You must n't send me back there , " he begged , " please ! I wo n't go back to Reality ! " <p> Her eyes turned cold . " You think we 're concerned with what you want ? You think we 'll shed a tear for one of you , " she choked the last words with sudden fury , " who does n't get what he wants ? " <p> Something was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the music was staggered , breaking up and reversing , the parts out of order . The walls of the dance hall seemed to be slowly receding , and the floor was bending , changing shape like a liquid avatar . <p> Composing her features , she stepped back . Looking around the room , she smiled again and spread her arms wide . " It 's happening , " she said . " The game is ending . " <p> FINALLY HE FELT the chill of the doorframe at his back . Gasping with gratitude , coughing up more acid , he turned and stumbled inside . He crawled past the corpses on their slabs , crawled toward his own coffin and the promise of his beautiful heaven . Collapsing on the immersion table , his fumbling fingers reconnected the attachments . The mind link warmly hugged his skull as he slipped it on . <p> Relief such as he had never felt washed over him . He flopped back onto the table and , triumphantly , triggered the Entry button . <p> The remaining people were huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world around them . The musicians had dissolved into a horrendous cacophony of noise , screeching through and piercing the air in a symphony of chaos . <p> He pulled up the enterface ; it was sluggish and off-balance , but was still functioning . He navigated through the portals as fast as he was able , till at last he found the one he wanted . <p> She was standing in the center of the ballroom when he focused on her again , eyes closed and arms stretched wide , gown swirling as virtuality melted away around her . <p> " I love you , " he whispered , and activated the Self-Termination portal . <p> The system started up , routines initialized ; connections were made . A moment of void ; and then  --  a rush , a sudden , giddying rush of brilliant light .... <p> He was home . <p> ILLUSTRATION ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> <p> By Aaron A. Reed <p> In the lingo Down Under , a " three dog night " is one that 's so cold you need three dogs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a three Reed issue is one that 's interesting , well-crafted , and includes the unexpected . ( Then again , we like to think most issues meet those terms . ) Our third Reed this month is marking his debut as a fiction writer with this story . He lives in Salt Lake City and is currently completing a degree in Film Studies at the University of Utah and hopes to have a career in the evolving medium of interactive storytelling  --  ( i.e. , persistent world online games ) . As " Shutdown/Retrovival " indicates , he 's very interested in the social consequences that this kind of entertainment will have as it becomes more commonplace , and in the social responsibilities of those creating it . <p>
