As U.S. troops finish mopping up in the Shah-i-Kot Valley of Afghanistan , commanders are turning their gaze to the next possible battleground for U.S. action : the central province of Uruzgan . The province , north of Kandahar , is " saturated " with al-Qaeda and Taliban troops , a senior U.S. military officer says . And the province has one other important attraction : it is the former home of Mullah Mohammed Omar , the Taliban leader , whose whereabouts are still unknown . Could Omar be hiding in Uruzgan ? U.S. officials believe it is a good possibility . Unlike Osama bin Laden , Omar is not a world traveler and tended to remain close to home even when running Afghanistan , U.S. officials say . He could have retreated to familiar ground . <P> But a campaign in Uruzgan would not be easy . Unlike their now dead or dispersed comrades in Shah-i-Kot , the al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters in Uruzgan are rigorously refusing to clump together into fat , tempting targets for the U.S. military . By spreading themselves across the snowcapped ridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( including family members ) , they can " avoid detection and compromise , " the senior U.S. officer says . U.S. intelligence has detected four or five groups of that size in the region . <P> If the al-Qaeda and Taliban have got smarter in Uruzgan , there 's hope that the U.S. troops have too . The last major U.S. military foray into the region was a nighttime raid conducted Jan. 24 . The Americans killed at least 16 Afghans and captured 27 more  --  but none of them turned out to be al-Qaeda or Taliban . Says an army officer : " That was a mistake we ca n't afford to make again . "
