Please hold , and an agent will be with you shortly . " Six hours later , I hung up , lowered our " Q " flag and discretely took my family to dinner . At a nearby restaurant , we met other boat owners who 'd also come into West Palm Beach from the Bahamas , had the same experience we did , and were guilty of jumping ship before clearing Customs . So much for Homeland Security , I thought . We 'd arrived on a Sunday afternoon . The U.S. Customs phone number we 'd called was listed in the cruising guides for use on weekends or after business hours . Monday morning , we called a local number for U.S. Customs , and within a half hour , we cleared our boat . According to the officer in charge , our calls on Sunday had been routed to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . We were also told we had to appear in person at the Palm Beach office of U.S. Immigration . We arrived to meet more than a dozen frustrated cruisers who , like us , were just trying to obey the law . But the Immigration officers were extremely polite and understanding , and within an hour our passports were returned and we were free to go . Checking back into the U.S. was just the beginning of our adjustment to reality after being away on Sawdust , our Thomas Point 43 , for nearly a year , cruising the Great Circle Route with a two-month side trip to the Bahamas . We still had another two months to go before we would reach our homeport of Annapolis , Md . But as each day went by , we realized our dream cruise was gradually coming to an end . We worked our way up the Atlantic coastline , staying inside the Intracoastal Waterway most of the time in order to see the sights along its shores . Our preference was for less populated , natural environments , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island on the Georgia coast . Here , we walked the beautiful wooded trails , caught glimpses of wild horses , explored old ruins and observed protected turtle nests along the ocean beach . But we also found the southern cities of Savannah , Ga. , Charleston , S.C. , and Beaufort ( both S.C . and N.C. ) , to be charming and entertaining with fine restaurants , cultural offerings and gracious , friendly people . Isle of Hope , just outside Savannah , which is listed on the National Historic Register , was a delightful stopover with its beautifully restored homes among magnificent live oak trees lining the waterfront . We took the public bus to Savannah and toured the city by horse-drawn carriage , learning more about the rich history of the South . We arrived back in Annapolis on July 1 , exactly one year to the day from our departure , and were welcomed home by Motor Boating 's editors with a champagne toast on board Sawdust at the Fawcett Boat Supplies dock . But my wife , Stacey , and I had mixed feelings about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free of the mundane , day-to-day activities of our " normal " lives , that we were apprehensive about getting back into our old routine . Our son , Dimitri , however , was anxious to see his friends . Our one-year " working sabbatical " had been everything we 'd hoped for , and more . We 'd discovered places unlike anything we had seen before ; we 'd experienced exciting , challenging times at sea , and we 'd made lasting friendships along the way . Often asked , " What was the best part of your trip ? " I quickly answer , " Spending time together as a family . " I saw Dimitri gain self-confidence as a young boy , diving for conch , swimming with sharks ( not intentionally ) and exploring islands and salt marshes with our dog , Marley . I watched with pride as Stacey recreated our most memorable moments with her watercolors , and I came to rely on her boat handling skills and calm demeanor , during those occasional , but inevitable , moments of danger . Stacey saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding work , begin to change as I finally learned to relax , appreciate the moment and enjoy having more time with my family . We are frequently asked how we all got along in such a confined space . Sawdust is a small 43-foot boat , having a relatively narrow beam of 13 ' 6 " . Inspired by the New England and Chesapeake Bay workboats , it lacks the extra room of a flying bridge common to many boats " doing the Loop . " There were times when the crowded conditions provoked irritability , but the most difficult situations were caused by the pressures of my having to conduct business on board . I 'd decided to continue managing my advertising and public relations agency while away , using today 's cutting-edge communications technology to stay connected to my office . I needed privacy at times to talk with clients and concentrate on my work , but those times did not always coincide with the needs of Stacey , Dimitri or Marley . My family sometimes felt like it was walking on eggshells while I sat at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranky laptops , buzzing modems , a humming computer server , and a whirring , grinding satellite dish antenna . My " office " consisted of a five-foot-wide desk with shelves for computer equipment and books across from Dimitri 's stateroom belowdecks . The space was bright and airy , as it was not enclosed or partitioned . Unfortunately , this openness often put me in the middle of other activities . But generally , we made the most of our surroundings . Dimitri , whom we home-schooled , might make his classroom a picnic table at a marina . A beautiful , private reading place was often just a dinghy ride away . Stacey and I also learned that a good marriage gets even better during an adventure like this one . We met other couples who , like us , were having the experience of their lives , working as a team and enjoying having so much time together . But we also met couples who had hoped taking a long cruise would help their troubled relationship . Often , the man 's dream became the woman 's nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be equally enthusiastic about taking off on such an adventure , and each partner must contribute to its success . Otherwise , all the frustrations and issues present in the relationship before the voyage only become exaggerated on board . As for Sawdust , we 'd designed the boat and had it built specifically for this cruise , trying to make it fit our particular needs . Experienced boaters know that every boat is a compromise , but while Sawdust was not perfect , it came close . Aesthetics are important to us , so our boat had to have great eye appeal . In our Thomas Point 43 , we chose a Downeast-style lobster yacht designed by Mike Kaufman of Annapolis and built by Mast &; Mallet in Edgewater , Md . She has a sweeping sheerline , a Carolina flair forward and lots of tumblehome aft . If I had it to do over again , I 'd find a way to lower the roofline a couple of inches for looks and reduce the tumblehome just a bit to increase cockpit space . Otherwise , we were thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sometimes did wish for a flying bridge , especially when navigating by the color of the water in the Bahamas . But a bridge would have meant more windage , the added expense of another set of controls and electronics , and a height that would have prevented us from slipping under closed bridges . To keep engine noise and vibration to a minimum in the pilothouse , I invested in an AquaDrive system installed between the prop and transmission , so running for five to six hours at cruising speeds was not tiring . Sawdust 's layout , which locates the galley and settee/dining table in the main salon , was a huge success . Being able to prepare and eat our meals while enjoying the sights in beautiful anchorages was a big part of our trip . We learned we did n't really need a stall shower separate from the head , however ; the space would have been better used to expand Dimitri 's cabin . We were often invited on larger , multi-decked motoryachts , and we drooled in envy at their space . At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to as " that cute little boat . " But each time we 'd get caught in a howling gale with threatening seas , and would arrive safely in one piece , it made us appreciate Sawdust 's workboat heritage . So what if we bumped rear ends while opening the fridge ? We had ourselves a good-looking , tough little ship . I 'd decided on a single-engine installation to reduce noise and vibration , lower initial and maintenance costs , and to allow for a sturdy keel for protection of the shaft and prop . With the 435-hp Caterpillar 3208 diesel we selected , Sawdust 's efficient Chesapeake Bay deadrise hull gave us cruising speeds of between 16 and 18 knots while burning a little less than a gallon of fuel per nautical mile . Carrying 270 gallons of diesel , this gave us a safe range of about 250 nautical miles . If we slowed to displacement speeds of 8 to 9 knots , our range more than doubled . Finding good fuel was never a problem , and I carried a large , separate " funnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My years of boating experience taught me to keep onboard systems simple . We have no generator , but instead used a 2,500-watt Heart inverter and a separate 1,000 amp-hour battery bank charged by a secondary 220-amp alternator . Our one , manual head never failed us . Our three-burner stove is propane , and our 12-volt refrigerator and freezer are well insulated , keel-cooled units from Frigoboat that have no moving parts to wear out or strainers to clog . A convection/microwave oven completed our galley setup . We could stay on the hook for four nights without recharging our batteries if we were careful not to use a lot of A.C.-powered gear . Ground tackle consisted of a 45-pound CQR and a 20-pound aluminum Spade anchor , both of which used a combined 250 feet of chain rode controlled by a big Muir windlass on a double-roller bow system . We also carried a 45-pound Danforth and another 200 feet of rode as a spare . The Spade was extraordinary , never failing to set on the first try . It held while the CQR skidded across the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary anchor . We never dragged anchor , even in gale force conditions , but we were hit by other boats that dragged in the middle of the night , causing some anxious moments . For entertainment , we mostly read . But we also enjoyed our " boom box " stereo , and we had a 15-inch , flat-screen TV with VCR in the main salon . Our KVH satellite TV antenna system worked very well until we got to the Exumas . Except for cable news , we found very little to watch on DirecTV , however , even with 150 channels . Speaking of waste , our 30-gallon SeaLand holding tank capacity was sufficient , as we found pump-outs in most marinas . Cruising in the Bahamas , where it 's legal , we made overboard discharges on our frequent offshore runs . Just before we left for our trip , we installed an air-conditioning system that worked when plugged into shore power , and are we glad we did ! Sawdust has excellent ventilation , and when anchored , we usually found enough breeze to keep us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since we were often wedged in a slip between large motoryachts blocking every whiff of air . The fall and winter of 2002 were unusually cold , even in the lower states , and we spent more than a few nights on the hook snuggling with Marley because we had no heating system on Sawdust when anchored out . We 're adding a small , bulkhead-mounted diesel fuel heater this year . While we considered installing a watermaker that would have run off the main engine , we decided not to bother because of its cost and high maintenance . It was a good decision . Sawdust holds 140 gallons of water , and as a family of three , we used as little as 15 gallons a day . Fresh water was free and plentiful everywhere we went except in the Bahamas . There , we used two collapsible five-gallon containers to carry the reverse osmosis ( R.O. ) water we bought ashore and ferried to the boat in our dinghy . R.O. water cost us as much as 60 cents a gallon in the Exumas , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes , we kept our total freshwater cost to about $350 , far less than the price of a good watermaker . For washing clothes , Stacey used an ingenious little hand-cranked contraption called a " Wonder-Wash , " which cost less than $50 . It took less than two gallons of warm water to do a small load , and we rigged lines in the cockpit for drying . I took great pride in designing Sawdust 's helm station and in specifying and locating the electronics . Besides selecting navigation instruments that would work together as an integrated system , it was important that I could easily see them all without taking my eyes off the water . I chose equipment manufactured by Simrad , a company my firm represents , that 's known for its industrial-grade products . My **27;510;TOOLONG , with its bright Sunview screen , was positioned right in front of me , with the autopilot and 10-inch radar nearby . Like most boaters , it took me a while to become accustomed to using the advanced features of these units , but everyday practice made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional data , besides the usual chart info , is stored on C-Map NT+ cartridges . Tide data , telephone numbers of marinas , locations of marine services and more were readily available . At the time of my trip , C-Map covered every place we went in great detail except for inland rivers and the Bahamas , but I understand even those areas are now being added or improved . We used paper charts extensively , as I still plot my course and position using dividers , parallels and pencil . Like reading a printed magazine instead of a Web site , I prefer the tactile feel of paper charts to a computer screen , and I like being able to see " the big picture " at a glance without zooming in and out . In the Bahamas , the detailed and highly accurate Explorer Chart Books were invaluable . As the voyage progressed , I relied less and less on my PC-based navigation systems . Maybe I 'm just unlucky , but I experience too many crashes of Windows-based programs in general to depend on them to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was driving : Occasionally , I 'd find myself fooling with it and not paying enough attention to what was in front of me . So , while I continued to use it for planning routes and downloading weather data , for onboard navigation I depended on my embedded marine electronics . And , even " marinized " laptops are not immune to the saltwater environment . Two months before I returned , my much-heralded Panasonic Toughbook died . The autopsy showed the cause of death to be saltwater corrosion . While I 'm no stranger to technology , there were times on this trip that I was so frustrated by the " cutting-edge " gear designed to connect me to the outside world , I came close to throwing it all overboard . While my handheld GlobalStar sat phone almost never failed me , the more complex system I used for wireless , broadband connection to the Internet and e-mail was n't as reliable as I had hoped . In essence , I developed a love-hate relationship with my KVH TracNet system . There were so many different pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall system that it was difficult to troubleshoot . Consider some of the possible reasons for problems : the satellite tracking antenna , the satellite constellation , the " Direct PC " service provider , a TracNet software glitch , a defective cell phone " air card , " the Web browser , the uplink antenna , Windows 98 , or maybe the PC itself . I estimated that for every two hours I was able to work online , I spent another hour getting on and staying connected . My monthly service charges sometimes exceeded $1,500 , three to four times what I had originally estimated . In all fairness , however , the TracNet system did allow me to take off on our voyage in the first place . More than a year has passed since I had my system installed , so maybe most of the bugs have been worked out by this time . Now that we 're back , Stacey and I are glad we did n't sell our house before we left . Instead , we rented it furnished , nearly covering our mortgage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had quit their jobs and sold their homes , and they were faced with starting all over when they returned home . Stacey had taken a one-year leave of absence from the Annapolis public school system , but she was able to apply for a new position online while we were in the Exumas . She loves telling everyone she was interviewed for her job while in her bathing suit on a satellite phone . Returning to a known job and our familiar home made her transition to everyday life a bit easier . My own adjustment back into the business world has been more difficult than I anticipated . I had hoped to return to a less demanding schedule than the one I left behind . I came back with plans to write a book and organize a photography show of our adventure . But soon , I was pulled right back into the world of meetings , deadlines and business trips . Almost before I realized what was happening , I was winning new business , hiring more people , expanding my space , increasing capital expenditures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found while cruising was being lost in the rush to succeed . Quality of life Then , Hurricane Isabel hit Annapolis . Without power at my offices for several days , I had a chance to think about how much happier I had been on Sawdust . While pumping out a flooded basement , I had what I call a B.G.O.  --  a Blinding Glimpse of the Obvious . I decided to sell the company I had spent nearly 30 years building to focus on just two or three clients I personally enjoy working with and to accept only select projects from others . I now have a support staff of just three , a far cry from the days when I employed 40 people and directed eight other ad agencies throughout Europe . Maybe we 'll have to make some adjustments to our lifestyle , but both Stacey and I are determined to preserve the quality of life we had gained during the past year . We 're already planning our next voyages in Sawdust . Next summer , I 'll be taking my family to Maine for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our boat to Seattle , Wash. , and cruise the Inside Passage to Alaska . We ca n't wait to get back on board to enjoy the freedom and adventure of cruising . Our advice ? Go now , while you can , especially if you have children . Try to keep things simple . You do n't necessarily need a big , luxurious yacht . You just need to know there 's a wonderful , alternative way of living out there . And it wo n't wait forever .
