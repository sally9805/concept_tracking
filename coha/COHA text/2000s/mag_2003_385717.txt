Section : BUSINESS &; PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES An increasing number of art shows accept electronic submissions , and some say this entry process is the inevitable future for juried events . <p> Artists are generally unique individuals , but on one subject they tend to speak as one : Filling out applications , rounding up slides , and mailing off the whole package to art-show organizers is time-consuming drudgery . Since many artists enter a variety of these exhibitions and fairs every year , the cost in time , expense , and patience can be considerable . The alternative , however , has been not to take part in the events at all , which is not an option for artists whose livelihood depends on the sales these shows generate . <p> A third way may be on the horizon for artists , particularly those who set up booths at art fairs and festivals . A growing number of juried arts and crafts show sponsors are permitting people to submit both applications and images of their work electronically , allowing artists to save the cost of postage and time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation ( WESTAF ) , working with the National Association of Independent Artists , is developing a system for artists to submit their work and applications online to a number of major arts and crafts festival organizers . Artists may fill out a standardized application and store their images in digital form . They could then select particular works that would be transmitted to specific festival sponsors along with their application information . The artists and craftspeople who regularly show and sell their work at fairs and festivals participate in seven to 12 shows annually on average , according to Matthew Saunders , the director of technology programs at WESTAF , citing a survey conducted by the Denver-based organization . " We can reduce the time they spend filling out applications to a minimum , " he advises . <p> Sponsors of fairs and festivals who register with WESTAF also save time and money by collecting the applications and images electronically ; a large staff would not be needed to painstakingly type in information about the artists , descriptions of their art , addresses for mailing labels , and other documentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for jurors , which they must do for mailed-in applications . For example , the Smithsonian Craft Show , which formerly needed a staff of 20 , found that it needed only five people to track the annual festival 's 1,300 applicants when it permitted artists to apply online , using a similar system in 2003 . According to Heidi Austreng , the program coordinator for the Smithsonian Institution 's Women 's Committee , which runs the craft show as a fund-raiser for the Washington , DC-based museum complex , " The process of taking slides out of envelopes , putting them in slide carousels , and labeling the carousels properly used to take days . Heaven forbid someone drops a carousel . We also had to requisition projectors and countless carousels . " Having everything stored within a computer 's memory lessened the chore . <p> The labor and money saved through the online method were negated in part by the cost of the design and operation of a computer system to handle the event ( $16,500 ) , but that expense will be amortized over the years that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the applicants to the Smithsonian Craft Show applied online , all the submissions were viewed in a digital format . The other 900 artists who applied in the traditional manner ( mailing in an application and slides ) were required to pay a higher entry fee  --  $55 instead of $45  --  to cover the costs of typing in artist information and digitizing , or scanning , slides . <p> Certainly , computers have become ubiquitous in the United States , but many people , artists included , are still not comfortable with them . The Smithsonian Craft Show surveyed artists about the online application system and found that the response was mixed . Those who preferred the older application process noted that they were not " computer literate " or that they already have slides of their work , Austreng reports . The Smithsonian may see an online system as the way of the future , but it still allows mail-in applications because it does n't want to lose exhibitors who are n't comfortable using computers . <p> Some view the jurying of digital images as inevitable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Mary Ann Cherry , the president of the Pastel Society of the Northern Rockies . " Our members often send each other images of their work by E-mail for critiques or just to show what they have been working on . We see absolutely no reason not to let people submit work for our juried show by JPEG a computer file that is small in size , yet allows high resolution for images . Cherry reports that computer-savvy members of her society have responded favorably to the concept of electronic jurying ; still , artists who have seen images on a standard computer monitor , but are unfamiliar with high-resolution screens , are likely to feel some trepidation about having their work digitized . ( Gail Fishback , an associate publisher of American Artist and an organizer of the Art Methods &; Materials Show in Pasadena , California , did not set up an electronic submission system for the show 's juried competition this past October , but she says she probably will in the future . " It sounds like a great idea . We just were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look into allowing electronic entries next year . " ) <p> The Paradise City Arts Festival ( PCAF ) , which sponsors shows in Florida , Massachusetts , and Pennsylvania , created perhaps the nation 's first online jurying process in 2000 , when it began scanning traditional photographic slide images , which were then projected from the computer onto a wall for the judges ' selections . Those images stay on file with the PCAF organizers , and artists may use the same artwork when applying for the company 's other shows . " The works are here already ; just tell us which works you want to submit for which show , " says Linda Post , a co-director of the Northampton , Massachusetts-based festival sponsor . " Having works already in our computer system takes away the pressure of ' I 've got to get my work in on time . ' We 've received letters and E-mails from artists thanking us for this new system of jurying . " <p> Post does n't require that the works submitted to a jury be brand-new . " Some artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , " she says . " We do ask that if they radically change their work in terms of medium or concept , they send new slides representing their work . Artists can also change the artwork in their file , if they have something they think will work with a jury . They can simply send in a slide or a CD to replace the old images . " PCAF also does not require that the art sent in for jurying be physically present at the show . " As long as the juried image is representative of the artist 's work , that 's fine , " says Post . " It 's unreasonable to expect the same artwork when some shows are juried a year in advance  --  the artist may very well have sold the piece in the course of the year . " <p> Presumably , all artwork submitted electronically to a festival jury would follow the same specifications and be viewed on the same monitors or screens , allowing decisions to be made solely on the quality of the works . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the use of programs  --  Photoshop , for instance  --  that allow digital images to be altered and enhanced . The backgrounds may be neutralized or given tints that set off the object in the foreground , and colors within the artwork may be sharpened or changed . PCAF 's Linda Post , herself a painter , says she occasionally performs minor color correction through Photoshop because the film used in making a slide may cause artwork to look greener or more yellow than it actually is . A number of fairs have art-review committees that examine the works on display at the shows to ensure that the actual pieces accord to the slides submitted to the jury . The ease of Photoshop-conversant artists to change colors and smooth out imperfections may increase the number of potential violations of festival rules or , at least , create a gray area in art-show ethics . How much alteration is acceptable ? How much computer enhancement is allowable in a field that is about the hand-made ? <p> There are fewer ethical problems with slides , if only because fewer artists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many show organizers find traditional slides cumbersome to work with . " The volume of space needed to handle thousands of slides is consider able , " photographer Larry Oliverson says . " None of those problems exist with digital files . Also , with certain jury procedures , after the first round of jurying with slides , you have to take out the images that were rejected so that you can go through the second round . That means moving all the remaining slides to eliminate blank spaces . It 's a very time-consuming process that , in a computer , can be taken care of in a few clicks . " However , as a fine-art photographer , Oliverson thinks the traditional slide has more information and is a truer representation of the original image . " There is a continuous gradation of , say , the color blue , whereas in the digital world , information is broken down into pixels that approximate but do n't provide quite the same amount of information , " he says . " However , as a practical matter , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably would n't be able to tell the difference . " <p> Both Post and Cherry also notice slight differences between slides and digitized images  --  Cherry claims that you " sacrifice a bit of clarity with the JPEG , " while Post maintains that digitized versions of very detailed work " do n't show up as well "  --  but neither woman finds these issues significant . One person who claims he does not see a difference is Mark Leach , the deputy director of the Mint Museums in Charlotte , North Carolina , who was one of the three jurors for the 2003 Smithsonian Craft Show . " Digital slides are just as good as traditional photographic slides , " he asserts . " To say anything else is a bunch of nonsense .
