Chapter One Peggy Beldon walked into her newly planted garden , taking real pleasure in the sights and smells that surrounded her . This was her private place , her one true source of serenity . The fresh briny scent of the water off Puget Sound drifted toward her as she watched the Washington State ferry glide from Bremerton toward Seattle on its sixty-minute journey . This was a typical May afternoon in Cedar Cove - comfortably warm with just a hint of a breeze . Peggy uncoiled the garden hose and moved carefully between the rows of leaf lettuce , sweet peas and pole beans . She had a strong practical streak , expressed in her vegetable and herb gardens ; she satisfied her craving for beauty with the flower gardens in front . Looking back at the house that always had been her dream , Peggy smiled . She 'd grown up in Cedar Cove , graduated from the local high school and married Bob Beldon on his return from Vietnam . The early years had been difficult because of Bob 's reliance on alcohol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered Alcoholics Anonymous ; it had saved their marriage and quite possibly Bob 's life . Until AA , Bob had spent most nights drinking , by himself or with friends . When he drank , he became a different person , no longer the man she 'd married . She did n't like to think about that time . Thankfully , her husband had remained sober for twenty-one years . Walking between the rows , Peggy gently watered the seedlings . Several years earlier , Bob had accepted early retirement and with the severance package , they 'd purchased the house on Cranberry Point . Peggy had loved it for as long as she could remember . Situated on a point of land overlooking Sinclair Inlet , the two-story structure , built in the late 1930s , had seemed like a mansion to her . Over the years , it had changed owners a number of times and had started to deteriorate , since no one had cared enough to provide the maintenance it needed . By straining their finances , Bob and Peggy had managed to buy it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband was a talented handyman and within a few months they were able to hang out a sign for their Bed and Breakfast . Peggy had n't known how much business to expect , how many guests would be attracted to the Thyme and Tide B and B , as they 'd called it . She 'd hoped , of course , that they 'd make enough to supplement their retirement income - and they had . She was proud of the success they 'd achieved . Their traditional home , warm hospitality and her cooking had brought them steady customers and a growing reputation . They 'd even been reviewed in a national magazine , which had reserved its highest praise for the food , especially her baking . The reviewer had spent two whole sentences describing her blueberry muffins and homemade fruit cobbler . She had twenty blueberry bushes and eight raspberry canes , and she pampered them lovingly . Each summer she was rewarded with an ample supply for her guests and her family . Life had seemed about as perfect as it could get . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger had knocked on their door in the middle of a dark , stormy night . If it had n't been so cliched she might 've been amused , but this was no laughing matter . The man had rented a room and then promptly locked himself inside . A hundred times since , Peggy had regretted not insisting he complete the usual paperwork . It was late , and he 'd seemed so tired that they 'd simply shown him to his room . They could deal with the necessities in the morning , over breakfast . But by morning , the stranger was dead . Ever since , Peggy had felt as if they were caught in some kind of whirlwind , tossed about by forces beyond their control . Bad enough that the man had died in their home , but then they 'd learned that he 'd carried false identification . Nothing was as it seemed . By the end of that day , after hours with the sheriff and the coroner , there 'd been more questions than answers . She saw Bob pull the riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the engine , Peggy paused in watering her seedlings , one hand shading her eyes . Even after all these years of marriage , she never grew tired of their life together . They 'd survived the bad times with their love intact . And their attraction , too . Bob was tall and had kept his shape , his sandy brown hair neatly trimmed . His arms were already tanned from exposure to the sun . He loved his workshop and she was genuinely impressed by what he could do with a few pieces of oak or pine . She 'd fallen in love with Bob Beldon as a teenager and she loved him still . Now , however , she was worried . She did n't want to think about the dead man , but it was unavoidable , especially after what they 'd recently found out . Sheriff Davis had identified their mystery guest as Maxwell Russell . To say Bob was shocked would be putting it mildly . He 'd been with Max in Vietnam . Dan Sherman , who was also dead , Bob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that squadron . They 'd gotten lost in a Southeast Asian jungle with tragic results . Once the identity of the dead man was established , another shocking revelation had come to light . The sheriff , with the help of local private investigator Roy McAfee , had discovered that Max Russell 's death was no accident . He 'd been poisoned . The water bottle he 'd carried with him had been laced with odorless , tasteless Rohypnol , commonly known as the " date rape " drug . The dose had been large enough to stop his heart . Maxwell Russell had gone to bed , tired from a long day of travel , and he never woke up . Bob rode past her on the lawn mower with a quick wave , and Peggy continued to water her garden , but a pang went through her . At this very moment Bob could be in danger , but he seemed content to ignore any risk rather than admit her concerns were legitimate . As she set aside the hose , Peggy caught sight of Sheriff Davis 's patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension between her shoulder blades . She hoped he planned to talk some sense into Bob . Her husband must have seen the patrol car at the same time Peggy did because he cut the engine and climbed off the lawn mower . Sheriff Troy Davis turned into the driveway , then stepped out of his vehicle . In the beginning , when it looked like Bob might be a suspect in the murder case , Davis was n't nearly as welcome here as he was now . The sheriff , who was probably a little heavier than he should be , took a moment to hike up his pants and adjust his gun before heading across the lawn to meet Bob . Unwilling to be left out of the conversation , Peggy shut off the water and hurried across the half-mown grass . " Peggy . " Davis touched the brim of his hat and nodded in her direction . " I was just telling Bob it might be a good idea if the three of us sat down and talked . " Peggy nodded in return , appreciating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to the patio , and Peggy was grateful she 'd taken time that morning to sweep it off . The three of them sat at the round pine table Bob had built several years earlier . He 'd painted it a deep gray-blue , a color that complemented the white siding . The striped umbrella was up and the patio was awash in sunshine . " I thought I 'd update you on my conversation with Hannah Russell . " ( Continues ... )
