Like many dads these days , Claude la France drops his two children off at school every morning . But the Toronto father is more than just a chauffeur when it comes to his involvement with his kids ' school . Sometimes he sticks around at lunch to supervise children who prefer to stay indoors before classes resume in the afternoon . La France serves as the school 's representative on a district-wide committee of school councils , and throws in his two cents when it comes to budgets . Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed Last year , though , la France boldly went where most fathers fear to tread : right into the classroom , pitching in one afternoon a week to help in Max 's senior kindergarten , and another afternoon to lead a reading group in Bianca 's grade-two program . Not surprisingly , he was the only father in the school doing that kind of volunteer work . " One reason I sell real estate is that it affords me the autonomy to be involved in their education , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer my time . All the teachers are very open and receptive . " It 's become an article of faith among experts that parental involvement  --  either through home-school organizations or more informally  --  is directly linked to children 's success in school . And most educators confirm that parental involvement is rising across Canada . With moms , of course , that sort of participation , especially in the elementary grades , is hardly a new thing . Yet a growing number of dads are following suit , due to a variety of social factors : the increasing ranks of the self-employed , flexible work hours and dual-income families , as well as a gradual erosion of gender stereotypes . While work hours remain a major impediment for many men , fathers are no longer invisible around the school . They 're doing drop-offs , running fundraising events and , perhaps most importantly , providing boys with positive role models in an institutional setting still predominantly staffed by women . When it comes to parent volunteers , educators are n't concerned with gender . Most are just happy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers have thrown in their lot at their kids ' schools , some subtle differences have emerged . " One of the biggest predictors of student success is the literacy of the mother , " observes Doug Acton , the principal of Orchard Park Public School in London , Ontario . " But when you have men involved , it catches the eye . It tends to be more intensive and of high quality . " In other words , because dads tend to be less involved at school than moms , those who do volunteer stand out , both in terms of their own level of commitment and in their capacity as role models . Such observations are based primarily on anecdotal evidence because there 's little Canadian research on the role fathers play in their children 's schools . But in the US , a 1996 longitudinal survey of almost 17,000 households , conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics , revealed that active dads do make a big difference . According to the study 's authors : " These results indicate that fathers ' involvement in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children making good grades and that the association is not due to the fact that mothers tend to be involved when the fathers are involved .... In two-parent families , involvement of both parents in school is significantly associated with a greater likelihood that their children in 1st through 12th grade get mostly A 's , enjoy school and are less likely to have ever repeated a grade . Fathers ' involvement has a stronger influence on the children getting mostly A 's than does mothers ' involvement . " The question is , how to get the dads to help out . For many fathers , the inflexible world of work makes it almost impossible to volunteer during school hours . Doug Acton recalls how he had a difficult time recruiting just four fathers to sit on his school council this year . And when they do show up , men sometimes fall into step with gender stereotypes . He notes , for example , that when dads come along on field trips , they end up being assigned to watch the kids who need extra discipline , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was the case with la France 's reading group . Charged with moderating the discussion of a book among half a dozen squirming seven-year-olds , la France was frustrated by his inability to keep the children focused and engaged . He chalked it up partly to his own laid-back parenting style . " Many mothers I spoke to said they were ruthlessly disciplinarian when it came to reading group , " says la France , who has since quit this type of volunteering . " It takes a very special approach to work with these kids and achieve positive results . " By the same token , fathers often seem to be more comfortable with traditionally male-oriented activities in their children 's schools : coaching sports teams , monitoring budgets and attending to school council business , all of which take place in the evenings . Rarely , if ever , do men turn up volunteering in the library ; they tend to gravitate toward tree-planting days and playground renovation projects . That describes my own experience . As a freelance writer , I occasionally take off a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immersion class . But the bulk of my involvement with his school has come through a push to revitalize the playground . It was my job to keep the process moving , chase down a delinquent supplier and monitor the quality of the work to make sure things were done properly . There 's nothing exceptional about my motives : enlightened self-interest and a desire to improve my children 's experiences , especially in the chaotic world of the schoolyard . Other kids benefit along the way  --  perhaps even more so with boys , who see so few men in their schools .

And some , like Stephen Goring , a downtown Toronto massage therapist , have come to relish the experience .

Goring , who has tried to convince other local fathers who are musicians to follow his lead , acknowledges that " it takes a certain type of dad , one who likes hanging out with kids . " For him , one of the real sources of satisfaction is watching how the boys , in particular , react to the sight of a man singing in their midst : All of a sudden , it 's cool . They join in , belting out the lyrics to old Beatles tunes while playing away on their air guitars . " It thrills my soul that they might continue to love to sing instead of getting shy about it , " Goring says . " The world needs fathers in the classroom , in contact with children . It 's long overdue . " <p>                    @
