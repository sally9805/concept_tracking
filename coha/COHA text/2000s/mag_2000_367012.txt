In most states , a man who pays cash for houses and automobiles , who keeps up to $500,000 lying around the house and conducts business meetings in restaurant bathrooms is liable to end up having his meals slid under a door . But Louisiana , a gift from God if not from the devil , is not most states . And so the federal corruption trial of former Governor Edwin Edwards is a delicious feast not just for the fly-on-the-wall look at the latest great rogue in American politics , but also because even if he 's guilty , many Louisianans are pulling for him to beat the rap . <P> " He 's no more corrupt than anyone else , including the Federal Government , " whispered one of the regular courtroom spectators  --  an attorney , no less  --  last week in Baton Rouge during the long-awaited marquee act in the 12-week trial . Edwards , 72 , a four-term Governor who once said the only way he 'd lose an election was if he got caught in bed with a dead girl or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own defense . He had listened to a parade of witnesses , including three men who pleaded guilty to their role in the alleged scam , say he had extorted millions from applicants for riverboat-casino licenses during and after his last term , which ended in 1996 . One of the three , former San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. , testified that he had handed Edwards $400,000 in a briefcase , Edwards ' alleged price for ensuring that DeBartolo would n't have a " serious problem " getting his license . <P> If there is life after death even for politicians , one has to assume that former Louisiana Governors Huey and Earl Long , the first politician-kings of the banana republic of Louisiana , were watching last week . With testimony about cash left in Dumpsters and hidden under frozen ducks , and good old-fashioned bagmen bundling and transporting the loot , it all seemed refreshingly honest compared with the deceit of PACs , soft money and other modern-day shams . Edwards ' wife Candy , who at 35 looks young enough to be his granddaughter , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen had an even better seat : he 's one of six co-defendants . One last scene setter : Edwards was masterly in his catch-me-if-you-can defense the last time the feds dropped the net . His 1985 racketeering trial , involving hospital licenses , ended in a mistrial , followed by an acquittal . <P> From the moment he took the stand last week , Edwards answered yes-or-no questions with unsolicited sermons . It 's like " Spartacus to the Romans , " complained prosecutor Jim Letten . U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola admonished , " This is not a theater . " Of course it was . Edwards told of high-stakes poker games in the Governor 's mansion and of " stacking up cash and throwing it away " on lavish impulses . Prosecutors say he used $733,567 in cash toward the purchase of a $1.3 million house . " The government prints $200 million in $100 bills every day . Must be a lot of other people using cash besides me , " said Edwards , who testified that he likes to keep between $250,000 and $500,000 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Sometimes I do n't , " he confessed . But he insisted that any riverboat money he got was for legitimate consultation and legal work .
