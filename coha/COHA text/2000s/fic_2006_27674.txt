prologue The phone call informing them of Francis 's death came while Stephen was watching a Godzilla movie on TV and his sister was twirling her baton about ten feet away from him and his mother was in the kitchen making a carrot cake and his father was putzing around in the den , trying to think of something to do . It was the second Saturday in January , 1993 , a day Stephen 's father would later describe as " unusually beautiful , " but in truth it was a rather typical winter day for southern Illinois , where it would snow for a while , let up , and start snowing again . The sun did pop out here and there , causing the snow in their yard and on the tree branches to glitter , but despite the occasional blast of sunshine the temperature stayed quite chilly , high around fifteen degrees . If that monstrous day held any beauty , perhaps it was when the family gathered for breakfast , Francis still alive and with them , talking and eating and gesturing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four , spent their last moments of innocence  --  at least for Stephen and his sister , who knew almost nothing of death and its apparent lifelong sting . Breakfast began when Stephen appeared in the dining room , stretched the last molecules of sleep out of his bones , and took his seat next to Crispy , his sister , and across from Francis , his brother . His parents , Helen and Gene , were seated at opposite ends of the table like children who could n't get along . Stephen was in the habit of complimenting his mother on her cooking skills , just to see the smile that would bloom on her face , so the first words he said that morning were , " Something sure smells good . " " It 's my new strawberry lip gloss , " Crispy said . " Not you , " he said . " You smell like a donkey . " " Dad ! " she complained . " Enough , " Gene said . Stephen spooned a small portion of scrambled eggs onto his plate from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulp-free orange juice into four glasses and a Tom and Jerry commemorative jelly jar ( for Crispy ) and distributed the juice around the table . Francis , who often had problems with congestion in the morning , held a paper napkin to his mouth and made sounds like an engine that would n't turn over , trying to clear his raw throat . Crispy started humming the song " Good Vibrations " by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch . She bopped her head and danced in her chair , pretending that she was at least a few years older than ten . Sugar-loving Gene slopped blackberry jam on wheat toast that he had already buttered . Gene was normally a grump in the morning , so it was smart not to say anything that he might take as an invitation to respond with grunts or with words made mean through exaggerated inflection , such as saying " oh , happy day ! " to Helen needing the car . But Francis did n't always play it safe . " I think it 's going to be a good conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a spoon . " Dr. Albertson from Berkeley is the keynote lecturer . He 's probably the top mycology guy in the country , though Dr. Fisher at Yale might disagree . " Later that day , Francis and his fiance , Jasmine , were driving to Chicago to attend the annual Midwest Mycology Conference at the Sheraton . Francis was one of five undergraduates selected to present a paper to fellow students . Gene was glaring at the slow-drip coffeemaker , encouraging it to speed up . " Sounds like a barrel of laughs , " he said in Francis 's direction . Stephen grimaced and momentarily lost his appetite . Why was his father the kind of person you had to put up with instead of a great man ? " Drive carefully , " Helen said , reaching for the saltshaker . " Arty 's predicting occasional flurries for most of the day . " Arty was Arthur Gifford , the Channel 7 meteorologist for the past nineteen years . He was a handsome man with a firm chin and a healthy Nordic glow , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy life . Gene stopped paying attention to her sometime during the Iran-Contra hearings . " I 'll probably let Jasmine drive so I can prepare for my presentation , " Francis said . " I 'm going to be talking about fairy rings  --  you know , those mushrooms that pop up in our yard every spring . Fascinating little buggers . People once thought the rings were formed by dragons setting their butts on the ground . " Crispy giggled at the word butts and spat out a piece of egg . Stephen offered his sister a grossed-out look , then glanced at his brother and watched him sip his orange juice . While he never told Francis this , he believed that his brother was lucky to be so beautiful . Francis had long eyelashes , thin blond hair , and pale blue eyes , the watered-down blue of dyed Easter eggs . His appearance was that of something delicate and unprotected , in the rabbit and kitten class , and should someone or something ever attack Francis his only hope would be to outrun him , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Stephen and his brother used to run together through the neighborhood , Francis training for his high school cross-country meets , it was usually a dead heat or close to it , though Stephen often suspected that his brother would let up at the end so they 'd finish neck and neck . " So what are your plans for today , deadhead ? " Francis asked Stephen . " Probe that girlfriend of yours ? " " Mind your language , " Gene said , protecting Princess Crispy from the foul words that men sometimes speak . " We 'll probably go sledding later , if she 's not grounded again , " Stephen said . " I 'm going , too , " Crispy said . " I figured that already , " said Stephen , sticking a finger into his mouth and pretending to gag himself . What did n't happen next : the earth did n't rumble , and the house was n't suddenly bathed in a purplish , heavenly light . No angels descended , the sun did n't weep , and a flaming golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Even though Francis 's life was winding down , none of them heard the ticking clock . So they all just sat there , eating their eggs and drinking their juice , when they should have been smothering Francis with kisses and telling him a thousand sweet things . episode 1 January Twenty minutes before breakfast had started , Stephen opened his eyes for the first time that day , having just cut short a dream where he was swimming though an underwater amusement park and was nearly out of air . He had an arrangement with his unconscious where he would wake up immediately should he run into serious trouble while dreaming . If he started falling from a dream-built skyscraper or was stuck in a pterodactyl 's beak , he 'd pull the plug , stop the show , and exit the theater . He sat up in bed , scratched himself in several places , and watched snow fall quietly outside his bedroom window , prettily frosted at its edges . Stephen was usually charged with clearing snow from the stoop , sidewalks , and driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoveling the zillion snowflakes off the concrete and blacktop into piles that , had it been three or four years earlier , he and Francis would have played King of the Mountain on ; but they did n't do that anymore and his brother was going to be gone all weekend anyway . Stephen despised winter and the entire history of human migration northward . Why did n't people stay put in tropical climates , where colorful toucans and hooting monkeys populated the trees , not just stupid robins and humdrum squirrels ? Not to mention that the holidays were done and it was only Day Thirteen of the dreaded what's-a-boy-to-do period between the end of the Bears season and the start of the White Sox season . ( He did n't much like watching Bulls basketball , where points came too easily , or Black Hawks hockey , where points were almost impossible to get . ) Bears , the animals not the football players , were the smart ones , hibernating these months away . His bedroom was filled with the things he loved . Posters of Sox stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as were pictures cut out of pro wrestling and baseball magazines . Above his bed a model of the space shuttle Columbia hung from the ceiling by a string . ( The model helped spur his many dreams of space flight , he suspected . ) Under his bed were two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle action figures , Leonardo and Raphael , which he secretly still played with , a well-thumbed-through 1991 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue , and some long-missing underwear and socks . The Amazing Spider-Man #372 rested on top of the bedcovers . Stephen was midway through a story where Spider-Man was battling arachnid robots , and even though the robots had the upper hand , surely good would prevail over evil once again and the robots would be destroyed . A school photo of Nicole , Stephen 's girlfriend , was wedged between his pillows : he had kissed the picture so often it no longer tasted like chemicals . The bookcase was stuffed with Mad magazines and his comic book collection , and books about baseball , UFOs , ghosts , ESP , archaeology , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and geodes , and some of his best baseball and football cards . He was waiting to be called to breakfast for the third time before he responded , one of the many duties of a lazybones , when the sun found an opening in the clouds and illuminated the falling snowflakes , making them appear feathery and inner-lit . " Good job , " he said to the universe . This is the best we can do in January , the universe said back . As he often did when nature was putting on a show for him , Stephen started thinking about God , or at least the god of design . Even though the Bible , from what he knew of it , never spoke of this , Stephen believed that an artistic god existed  --  maybe not in heaven minding the store but somewhere  --  who insisted on things like patterns for each snowflake , despite the fact that plain old flaked ice would be simpler and more efficient . This same god drew unneeded yet dazzling designs on butterfly wings and turtle shells , painted stripes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face and arms . He went crazy on peacocks , could have done a little more with hippos . As Gene might have put it , God was cutting into his profits with all these bonuses and freebies . While watching the snow and thinking about its maker , Stephen concluded that the " no two snowflakes are exactly the same " notion was a bunch of baloney , that there were , in fact , only 144 possible designs . To prove his theory he would need to build dozens of snow collection stations and place them across the globe , purchase several cameras fitted with close-up lenses , recruit an international staff of volunteers and make sure they are all hooked up to his computer database . . . " Stephen , breakfast , " his mother yelled up the stairs . " Sleepyheads never go far in life . " Although he was certain that hundreds , perhaps thousands , of sleepyheads had gone far in life , that greats like Einstein and " Shoeless Joe " Jackson spent considerable time dreaming up the formulas or home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his blanket and quilt , combed his hair with his fingers , wiped his sticky mouth on a pajama sleeve , went to the window and checked out the temporary diamonds piling up in the yard , ran into the bathroom and took a whiz , splashed water on his face and told that handsome boy in the mirror , " You have the heart of a champion , " and sprinted downstairs and into the kitchen , joining his family . The hour before Francis left home to pick up his fiance in Carbondale was mindlessly wasted . While Francis packed his overnight bag , Crispy and Stephen fought about which cartoons they would watch on television ( Stephen 's policy was to claim to like whatever shows Crispy hated ) , Helen emptied the dishwasher and got started on the dusting , and Gene drove to his furniture shop to make a quick check that his new apprentice , Todd Upshaw , was n't raiding the cash register or smoking dope in the woodshop , this last offense being what led to the firing of Mel Griffiths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stephen were sitting near the TV and watching the Land of the Lost kids hide from a stegosaurus ( Stephen thought that Holly , one of the lost kids , was a real cutie ) , when Francis came into the living room and set down his bag and squeezed Stephen 's shoulder bones . Stephen smiled and peered up at his brother and said , " Bye . " Just that single word , nothing poetic or saving . Crispy did a better job in her farewells . She jumped up on Francis , wrapped her arms around his neck , and gave him three pecks on his mouth . Francis carried her all of the way to the front door , Crispy dangling like a necklace , and then she dropped to the floor and scampered back to the television set . " I 'm heading out , " Francis said loudly , pulling open the door . Stephen turned and looked at his brother and waved . Francis was always leaving and returning . It was no big deal . " Say hello to Jasmine for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And drive safely . " She was holding a feather duster in her right hand so she gave Francis a quick , one-armed hug . " Will do . See everyone Monday , " Francis said . He slung the strap of his bag onto his shoulder and left . Outside , Gene had just returned home and was brushing snow off Francis 's car , a maroon 1990 Plymouth . Gene started to reach for his wallet while asking his son if he needed a Jackson or two for snack money or parking fees , but Francis waved him off . " Okay then , have a good time at your mushroom shindig , " Gene said . The snow had just stopped falling and a patch of blue sky hung above them . Perhaps that 's where beauty showed itself , in the arrival of blueness on an otherwise gray day . Or in the way a chilly breeze moved Francis 's hair or how the cold had pinkened his face and made his eyes wet as he stood , alive , just a few feet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho-hummer , " Francis said . " Have you ever been in a room with three hundred mycologists , most of them professors and grad students ? I 'm hoping to shake things up a little if I do n't chicken out . " Gene shrugged . He could n't imagine driving all the way to Chicago just to spend the weekend with three hundred anything , except maybe leggy supermodels . " You better get going , " he said . " May the road rise up to meet you , and all of that happy Irish crap . " Francis smiled , then opened the car door with a gloved hand and tossed his bag in the backseat and slid inside . He wrapped a seat belt around his belly , glanced in the rearview mirror , pulled off his scarf and patted down his hair , started the car , pumped the accelerator , ran the windshield wipers twice , checked the mirror again , and backed down the driveway and headed north on Briarwood , waving spastically and honking the car horn three times . As Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snowbrush at him . He had meant to make sure that Francis had his own brush , as well as flares , jumper cables , a bag of sand , a shovel , and a blanket , in case he got caught in a blizzard or had car trouble . But he had forgotten to ask . Gene will soon think of himself as Francis 's last chance . Had he embraced him , or said a few more words , or even tackled Francis and pinned him to the ground for a minute he would have altered fate by delaying his departure . But he failed to act and his boy paid for it . Helen , Crispy , and Stephen will adopt similar beliefs . If they had said or done one little thing Francis might have survived that day . One stupid little thing . After lunch , Stephen put on his coat and boots and grabbed the radio-controlled monster truck he had gotten for Christmas as his big present and ran outside . He set the truck down in the yard and pushed a lever on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wheels were clogged with snow and all it wanted to do was whine and squeal and spin its wheels and not go anywhere . The truck 's cries reminded Stephen of his sister , who seemed to have a complaint attached to every exhalation of breath : the ice cream she was eating did n't have enough chocolate chips or the buttons on her new blouse were too slippery . He let go of the lever and set the control in his coat pocket , then started kicking through the few inches of snow in the yard to make a path that the truck might follow , and for the pleasure of disturbing nature 's plans for an even dusting , a joy similar to throwing a rock into a puddle or rumpling the covers of a freshly made-up bed . When Stephen stopped his kicking he looked back at the lane of grass . He had just done a good deed , he thought , freeing up some green in very un-green January . " Shiver me timbers , " he said , starting to feel the cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen sometimes said , " It 's as cold as a witch 's disposition . " The key to winter survival was to keep busy , Stephen remembered , so he bent and grabbed a glove full of snow and tried to form a snowball out of it , but the ball quickly crumbled . He was planning to make dozens of snowballs and then lure Crispy outside , or , if that failed , to build a snow fort , but it was n't very good snow for packing ( the formula was a little off ) , and fort-building was likely on that growing list of fun things he was pretty sure thirteen-year-old boys could no longer get away with . Snow started to fall again , more energetically . He caught several snowflakes on his gloves and examined them before the flakes , under orders to not reveal the secret of limited number of designs , melted themselves . But it was too late : he had definitely seen these patterns before . Stephen peered at the eyeball-white sky and imagined God sitting on a wooden stool in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of snowflake maker , one with a rotating design wheel . The wind picked up and chilled him , and since there was no one to play with Stephen decided to go back inside his warm house . He started trudging to the front door , and when he came upon the radio-controlled truck he walked right by it . In an hour or two his mother or father would see the truck and call him a nincompoop or something worse for leaving his best toy in the front yard , where one of the bad kids in the neighborhood might see it and steal it . Stephen periodically felt the need to remind Helen and Gene that he was part of the family . They 'd never own up to it , but his mother clearly favored Francis while his father loved Crispy the most . He hated being the middle child . Pulling open the front door , that first wave of heated air felt something like love . While he admired those thick-skinned souls who rode dogsleds across the Yukon or who manned science outposts in Antarctica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cozy existence . He slammed the door shut , took off his coat and boots in the foyer , then went into the living room where he sat on the carpet and placed his socked feet against a heater vent , wiggling his toes . His parents were elsewhere in the house , so he would n't get busted for being a " heat hog . " When his feet were toasty he scooted over to the TV and turned it on and saw that an old Godzilla movie was playing , so he stretched out on the floor and watched the film . In a scene where Japanese citizens were running like crazy to get away from Godzilla , he inserted himself in the movie . He was the little boy wearing a white baseball cap . His name might have been Terry . His hat went flying off , in the path of Godzilla , and for a second Terry thought about going back for his beloved hat , but he decided to keep running . He could get another cap but not another life . Crispy danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stephen did n't understand why his parents allowed his sister to twirl the baton indoors since periodically the baton would escape her and bounce off walls , lamps , or his head . He stood up and was about to retreat to the safety of the couch when the phone , a green cordless with oversized numbers on the dial pad , which Gene had bought at the Kmart in Caswell a year earlier despite the fact that Helen had told him to get a beige or white phone so it would go with the wallpaper and carpeting ( she also did n't much like the large numbers ) , chimed . Stephen was the closest to the phone so he answered it . " Hello , " he said , hoping that it was Nicole on the other end . She was a goofy girl , and sometimes she 'd phone him and say , " I 'm just saying hi , " and he 'd say hi back , and she 'd say , " Okay , bye then , " and he 'd say bye , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on , and ten minutes might pass before they became tired of the game and hung up their respective phones . " Is this the Harrelson residence ? " asked a woman 's voice . Stephen thought that the caller was a saleswoman for The Ledger . Even though they were already subscribers their salespeople kept harassing them . " Yes it is , " he said . " I 'm calling from . . . is your mother or father at home ? " " Hold on . " Stephen was about to yell for his dad  --  his mother hated talking to salespeople , whom she both despised and felt pity for , pity usually winning , so they were always changing long-distance carriers and buying lightbulbs to help support paralyzed veterans  --  but Gene walked in behind him so Stephen handed him the phone and returned to the living room and plopped down on the couch . Later , he 'd wish that he had run upstairs or run away , because he could hear Gene talk to the woman , every awful word , and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's face . " This is Gene Harrelson . . . . Yes , I 'm his father . . . . " The first sign of trouble . Gene was the father of two male children , and unless someone was phoning to complain that Stephen had been looking up her daughter 's skirt or down her blouse , crimes he was likely guilty of , the call was about Francis . He glanced at his dad . Worry was narrowing Gene 's eyes and flattening his half-smile of a minute ago . " What , what are you saying ? " Gene asked . " Prescott Memorial ? I see . . . . " Prescott Memorial sounds like a hospital , Stephen thought . What would Francis be doing at a hospital ? Did Jasmine get sick ? Blood surged in Gene before leaving , reddening his face , and his mouth hung open when he was n't talking , like he no longer had full control of its hinge . " A car accident ? " Gene said . " Oh shit ! " No no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident ? But he has to be okay , right ? He 's a safe driver , hardly ever goes fast . But sometimes he does . Gene 's eyes were now glistening , almost pretty , and his chest heaved , like the old man had just run a mile . " So you 're certain ? " Gene asked . " Goddamn it ! Yeah , well goody for Jasmine 's family . " Was Francis badly hurt ? Stephen wondered . Did he lose an arm ? A leg ? Not a leg . How will he run ? Gene 's flesh was now ashen , almost bluish . He slumped against a wall while holding the phone to his ruined face and started shedding tears . The only other time Stephen had seen his father cry was a summer night a few years earlier when Gene got the news , also by phone , that his father , Marvin , had died suddenly . But this could n't mean . . . " No , we 'll manage , " Gene said to the caller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me one thing , was he . . . was he dead on arrival or did you , was there time to try . . . " Dead on arrival . Those three words tore dozens of holes in Stephen , like a flurry of gunfire . He collapsed onto the couch and felt parts of himself escaping through the many bullet holes . Francis , his smart , handsome , and fun brother , must be dead . But how ? He was alive , just hours ago . He ate breakfast , smiled , touched Stephen 's shoulders , said good-bye . No . Please God . No . Gene was standing more upright now , though a tremble betrayed his new vigor , and it appeared that something other than blood was holding him up : his flesh was still lifeless . He hung up the phone , wiped his damp face with a shirtsleeve , and glanced at Stephen . It was a cold look that reached all the way to Stephen 's bones , a look that said how dare you still be alive when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room , then started to sink again . He backtracked and leaned into the wall and strained to recover a workable breathing pattern , then put a hand over his mouth . From behind that insufficient shield he said , " What the fuck ? What the holy fuck ? " Stephen was waiting for his father to then say terrible things to Crispy and him , but instead Gene turned and began a slow death row march toward the kitchen , hunched and pained like he was dragging a car behind him . " Helen , you in there ? " Gene said , as he moved from the foyer and into the hallway that led to the kitchen . " I have some bad news . " Helen had just put a carrot cake in the oven and was about to start on the frosting ( the secret is to add a half cup of orange juice to the cream cheese base ) . Saturday dinners always featured a homemade dessert . In the living room , Stephen glared at the television set . Godzilla was still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passenger train car . " Stop it , " he said to the beast , but Godzilla paid him no mind , smashing the train car and continuing his destruction of Tokyo . Stephen then looked at his sister . No bullet holes in her yet . Crispy was twirling her baton , tapping a foot against the carpet , and singing a Whitney Houston song , " I Will Always Love You , " making up her own words when she did n't know the real ones . She had sprinkled silver glitter on her face and in her hair and was wearing blue leggings and a bright red ruffled and spangled blouse , an outfit that a famous baton twirler might wear . " Crisp , " Stephen said , barely . " Shut your trap , this is my favorite spot , " she said , spinning the baton and seeming surprised that it stayed in her hand . But then she gazed at her brother and dropped the baton . It bounced one , two , three times and then settled on the floor near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " It 's Francis , " he said , firing the gun . Stephen bolted upstairs to the bedroom he had once shared with Francis , and fell to his knees like those needing a big favor from God are supposed to do . He pressed his hands together in the proper way and cried ten thousand urgent prayers : " Oh God please save Francis , you have the power , please heal him fix him do n't let him be dead , please God please raise him up and send him back to us you can undo all of this please please please I 'll do anything you want , oh please take someone stupid and mean instead , please oh God do n't let this be true , we need him here on earth , please God I will do anything , oh God please this is the last thing I will ever ask of you oh please God , please God do n't let Francis be dead . Just send him back and I 'll be good forever . " Prayer was the only possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be working : no second phone call came , saying it had all been a terrible mistake . It was understandable that God might not listen to Stephen 's pleas that the White Sox win the World Series this year or for sudden wealth and two inches more height , but asking that he return his brother to him was the biggest prayer he would ever pray . The call should have gone straight through . Or perhaps God did respond by placing a holy hand on Stephen 's skull and knocking him out for several hours . Francis and Stephen are fishing at Shepherd 's Lake . They sit on an old wooden dock , their legs dangling over the side and their fishing rods held outward , the lines cast into gray , still water . Francis is wearing black pants and dress shoes , and the collar of his white shirt is turned up like he 's a tough guy . There are no clouds in the sky , but strangely it does n't hurt Stephen 's eyes to look at the sun . Perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's line is tugged and he starts to reel in a fish . " Bet it 's a beaut , " he says , cranking the reel . This seems to take forever . Colors even arise for a minute , the sky and lake bursting blue and Francis 's flesh turning pink before going white again . Finally , the fish is pulled out of the water , jerking and trying to break free . Francis grabs the line and lets the hooked fish fall to the dock where it continues its desperate flopping . " Throw it back , " Stephen says . " We are n't going to eat it . " " I just like watching it struggle , " Francis says . " Hard to imagine , not belonging in this world of oxygen . " Francis takes hold of the fish , twists the hook free , and says , " Do n't worry , he ca n't feel any pain , " but blood begins spurting from the fish 's mouth , gallons and gallons of it , splashing onto the dock and spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis tells the fish to steer clear of worms on hooks from now on and drops it into the lake . The fish swims away , and when Stephen loses sight of it he turns toward his brother but Francis is gone . He sets down his fishing pole and stands up and peers back at the shore but does n't see his brother anywhere . The dock , originally about ten feet long , is now at least fifty feet in length , and there are gaps in it , missing planks that have to be jumped over . His fishing rod goes flying into the lake and skims atop the water . A really big fish , a marlin maybe , must have bitten down on the hook . But it 's not a fish speeding away , it 's Francis , more being tugged than swimming . " Hey , come back here , " Stephen says , wanting both his brother and his fishing pole back . Before he can dive into the water and swim after Francis the tide goes out , leaving behind a bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumbering crabs , and strange luminous rocks that shoot silver light . Stephen jumps onto the sand , grabs one of the rocks , and feels around for a battery compartment but there are n't any seams . Where 's its power source ? The rock 's light is almost too much so he closes his eyes . In his bedroom Stephen opened his eyes . It was dark outside , meaning that he had been asleep for hours , maybe days . The house was quiet . Why had no one called for him ? Come for him ? His eyes and lungs ached from all of the crying he had done . A record cry , possibly , but he did n't want to call the people at Guinness Book of World Records and tell them about it . " Francis , come home , " Stephen said . Man or ghost , either one . Just come home . Light from a streetlamp was creeping into his room and making shadows on the walls . Years ago , Francis used to create hand shadows with that light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would make the doo doo doo doo **32;568;TOOLONG sound from the movie Jaws , and soon Unsuspecting Hand , just out for a stroll , would be swallowed up by Shark Hand . Unsuspecting Hand would put up a valiant fight but in time his pinky and thumb would go limp . Shark Hand might then come after Stephen and he 'd have to cover his mouth to keep from shrieking . When Francis moved home from college , Stephen was certain that he would want to share the upstairs bedroom with him again , but it did n't happen . A man has to have his own space , Francis explained , as they carried his stuff to the basement . Stephen said that he understood but he really did n't . How could his brother prefer the basement , where every upstairs toilet flush sounded like a monsoon coming your way , to the funny jokes and fake farts offered in Stephen 's bedroom ? Those were the best times , when he and Francis lived in the same room and they 'd wrestle and play and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that they had to pretend there was an invisible wall between their beds from now on so people would n't think they were gay boys , they still had fun . The fake wall was n't soundproof so Stephen and his brother would talk to each other , sharing secrets , often made up , or tired ghost stories about the many one-armed child killers who lived in the neighborhood . Fuck the world . If Stephen had owned anything deadlier than a squirt gun he would have shot out the streetlights on Briarwood , every last one of them . " Francis come home , " he tried again , louder this time . " Stop screwing around . " It made no sense , Francis dying . While most kids may only think their older brothers are unstoppable , Stephen knew this to be true about Francis . As an infant , Francis swallowed a bottleful of St. Joseph 's baby aspirin but survived . Helen must have told that story a hundred times . When he was fifteen , Francis was on a Science Club field trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mail truck . The van driver and all of the kids suffered broken bones or bad bumps and bruises , except for Francis , who walked away unhurt . And , two summers ago , Francis slipped on the high board at the city pool and hit his head on the board but suffered only a small cut . It was then that Stephen became convinced that his brother had an invisible protective shield around him , like the spaceships on Star Trek . Three times Death 's dark ship had come for Francis and three times Starfleet forces repelled it . But it came a fourth time . He stood up and stumbled into the bathroom and peed for what seemed to be a very long time  --  even emptied the reserve tank . He was all liquid now , tears and piss , and maybe throw-up soon if his stomach did n't settle . Flushing the toilet , he hoped that the rumbles would remind his family that he was upstairs all by himself . Hearing noises downstairs , Stephen went to the stairwell and sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Borden , and two other women , probably from First Community Church , gathered in the living room . " This is a terrible tragedy , " said one of the churchwomen . " Yes , " said Helen . " He was so young , " said Mrs. Borden . " Yes , " said Helen . " And so gifted , so full of promise , " said a second churchwoman . " I know , " said Helen , her voice cracking . Stephen hung his head and cried . He had thought he was all out of tears . " Please God , do something , " he asked . " This is your last chance . " A minute later he gave God another final chance . In time the visitors left and the lights were dimmed . Stephen , wanting something simple in his belly like a graham cracker , crept down the steps . Only the chandelier in the foyer was lit , turned low , so he twisted the knob a half turn , adding more light . The house smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether his parents and sister had eaten dinner . Did Mom make sandwiches ? Were such things still possible ? There was a tap at the front door so he opened it and saw a chubby man smiling one of those smiles where the edges of the mouth rose but the person did n't look the least bit happy . The man said he was a reporter for The Ledger named Clifford Harper . " I 'm sorry to bug you at a time like this but we need a picture of Francis Harrelson for the morning edition , " he said . Stephen wondered if the man was a government agent , disguised as a fat reporter . Francis was n't really dead , that was just a cover story . His brother was working for the CIA , Mycology Division . First fake the boy 's death , say in a car accident , then hire some fatso to pose as a reporter . . . " We 've been trying to call all night , " Clifford said . " I was about to turn around but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you could get a picture for me ? I 'm afraid I 'm bumping right up against deadline . " The reporter reached into an inside jacket pocket , and Stephen expected him to pull out a gun or one of those glowing rocks , but instead it was a writing pad and a pen . Stephen glanced at the phone and saw that the plug had been yanked from the outlet , then he hustled into the den and found the big box of family photos that Helen had been promising for years to put into albums . He pulled out a snapshot from the previous summer of Francis cheerfully holding a cat-sized mushroom he had picked in a Minnesota woods . He returned to the living room and handed the picture to the reporter . " This should do it , " the man said , examining the photo . " You ca n't keep it . We need it back . " " I 'll return it within forty-eight hours . " " Cross your heart and hope to die ? " Clifford reluctantly crossed his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to get a few words from them for the article . A few words about the deceased . " " Just say that he was the best brother in the whole world . " " Sure , but could you please get your mom and dad ? I 'll only need them for a minute . " " They 're dead , " Stephen said , closing and locking the door . Through a side window he watched the reporter schlep to his car , a compact that he could barely squeeze into , and drive off . Why Francis ? Stephen wondered for the hundredth time . Why did Francis have to leave this world while the dumb and ( he suspected ) smelly reporter was allowed to stay ? Why Francis ? Still hungry for a graham cracker , Stephen started shuffling to the kitchen when he saw that Crispy was asleep on the couch . He was n't normally the thoughtful , caring kind of brother , but this day was unlike any other he had ever lived through , so he went to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides under the cushions so she 'd stay tightly wrapped . There was still glitter in her hair and on her damp face . He kissed her on the cheek and smelled strawberries . " Francis ? " she asked , opening her eyes . " No , sorry , " he said . He looked at the phone and suddenly remembered that Francis owned a pager , so he dashed over to it and plugged it in and quickly punched in the number followed by 911 . " Call back , " Stephen begged his brother . The pager buzzed somewhere , at a hospital , or in a smashed car , or alongside a dangerous road , but Francis never called back .
