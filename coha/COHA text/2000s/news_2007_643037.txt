<p> PEOPLE ask me , more often than any other question by far , where to go to learn about wine . <p> Usually I tell them to go home . <p> No kidding . The best place to learn about wine is at home , particularly if you stop off at a good wine shop on the way . <p> What I 'm about to propose is a do-it-yourself method that has a lot to offer to just about anybody who loves wine , or wants to learn about it . In fact , if you 'll join in with me , we will take this home wine class together and be the better for it . Let me explain . <p> Wine classes are best if you already know a little something and have decided that you are enthusiastic enough to pursue a passion . But for beginners they can be daunting , and they tend to teach more about how to describe wines rather than helping you learn what you like . <p> Books can be inspiring and entertaining , and at some point they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you think you can learn to play golf by reading a book ? Of course not . You have to get out there and struggle , for years most likely . <p> Learning about wine is far more pleasant . All you have to do  --  almost  --  is drink it . <p> My approach does require a little thought and a modest bit of work , though , because you will learn only if you pursue wine systematically . <p> First , identify a good wine shop near you . If the answer is n't obvious , ask a wine-obsessed friend for some recommendations . Second , find somebody at the shop with whom you seem to have a rapport and who is passionate about wine . Certain clues will help you gauge the passion . For example , if a salesperson tries to entice you by quoting scores from a consumer magazine , forget it . But if the salesperson explains why he or she loves a particular wine , it 's a very good sign . <p> Now you are ready to get down to business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , six white  --  and give the shop a spending limit . You do n't need to be extravagant , but it 's not a time to stint , either . I suggest $250 , give or take $50 . <p> If the shop is a good one , you will be taking home a guide to the diverse and wonderful forms wine takes around the world . Some you will love , others you may detest . Either way , tasting a range is essential to learning about wine and about your own tastes . <p> Now comes the fun . Every night , or however often seems right , open one of the bottles with dinner . This is important . You want to drink a wine with food for the full experience . <p> Just the other night in a Spanish restaurant , I tasted a Rueda , a white wine made from the verdejo grape . On its own it was unexpectedly tart and pungent . With a bite of my shrimp-and-fig tapa , it was softer and more harmonious . <p> Over time you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which foods . A really good wine shop may even have suggested general food pairings with the wines . <p> You will have to take some notes . Write down the name of the wine , the vintage , what you ate with it , and what you liked or did n't like about it . It 's even easier than it sounds , especially if you do n't try to use the florid language of wine writers . <p> As you inhale the aromas and taste the flavors , think in general terms  --  was it sweet ? Bitter ? Did the aromas remind you of fruit , or maybe something else ? Perhaps it did n't taste like fruit at all , but like a beautiful sunset . Do n't know that I 've had a sunset , but it 's evocative , at least . <p> The most important thing , though , is not how you describe the wine but whether you liked it or not , and whether you felt it enhanced what you ate or clashed with it . When you finish the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the salesperson and , based on what you liked best , ask the shop to put together a second case of different bottles . <p> With this method you will gain a sense of what wines you like best . Eventually , if it 's fun , you may be motivated to find out even more . <p> That 's the time to buy a book or take a class , because now you have a context for organizing , understanding and digesting a blizzard of information . You may not be driving the ball 300 yards , or picking out Pomerols from Pommards , but you know what ? Very few people do . <p> Now , as I said , I think this method is great not just for beginners but for anybody who wants to learn more about wine . So I 've gone out and placed an order for a mixed case of wine on a $250 budget . In fact , I placed not just one order but two , from different shops , to see how the selection of the mixed case might differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , I called Lyle Fass at Chambers Street Wines in TriBeCa , an excellent , idiosyncratic shop that specializes in wines of the Loire , Burgundy and Piedmont . I know Lyle , and we share similar tastes for offbeat wines , so I asked him to please put together a case for me as he would for anybody else trying to learn about wine . It turns out that he gets a lot of requests like this . <p> " All the time , " he said . " It 's the funnest thing in the world . " <p> Out of curiosity , I also placed an order with a different sort of place , Sherry-Lehmann , the ultimate establishment wine shop . I spoke on the phone with Joy Land , a salesperson whom I did n't know , but she knew exactly what I was after , and she quickly described her own palate . <p> " My background and my love is French wine , " Ms. Land said . " I like wines that are very elegant . I do n't like wines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or wines that stain your teeth . " <p> I 'll go along with that , though I do admit I kind of like purple . <p> I 've now received both cases and they are similar conceptually , though they differ completely in the particulars . Both contain a Bordeaux , a red Burgundy and a white Burgundy . Both include a riesling and a zinfandel . Both include a sauvignon blanc , a Cotes du Rhone and a red from Italy . Both Lyle and Joy decided that one of the whites needed to be a Champagne . <p> I 've got my work cut out for me , and I hope you 'll join me . I plan to keep you abreast of my progress on my blog , The Pour . <p> If you are newsprint-bound , check back here over the next couple of months and I 'll let you know what I 've learned .
