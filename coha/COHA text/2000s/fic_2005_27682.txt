Chapter One Chief Matthew Cade rarely considered another line of work , but the 4:30 a.m. phone call about the dead teenage girl made him long for a job as an accountant or electrician-some benign vocation that did n't require him to look into the eyes of grieving parents . He sat on the side of his bed , rubbing his eyes as he clutched the phone to his ear . " She 's from Cape Refuge , Chief . " Myrtle , his night shift dispatcher , sounded shaken . " That new guy , Scott Crown , just found her floating in a boat on the Tybee side of the river . Looks like a homicide . " Cade braced himself . " Who is it , Myrtle ? " " Did n't give me a name yet . If they know it , they 're keeping it off the radio for now . But Chief Grant from Tybee is hot about how Crown handled things , and he wanted you to come to the scene as soon as you can . " " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cat , jumped onto his lap , purring for attention as Cade fumbled for a pen and jotted the address down . The cat stepped onto the bed table and plopped down on the notepad . " So what is it Crown did ? " " I 'm not clear on that , Chief . But he 's young . Go easy on him . " He clicked the phone off and thought about the nineteen-year-old rookie . Crown had joined the force straight out of the academy ; he had n't even been in Cade 's departmenta week . His zeal to be the best cop in the department had led to a few mishaps already , but nothing serious . Cade knew he just needed to give the kid some time to grow into his position . But what had he done to aggravate the neighboring chief ? He got up , wincing at the arthritic ache he always felt in his leg first thing in the morning . It had healed from the multiple fractures he 'd sustained in an injury a year ago-and he 'd overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how far he 'd come . He got dressed and hurried out to his truck . It was cool for May , but he knew it would warm up to the upper eighties by the end of the day . Life would go on as it always did-murder or not . As he drove across the bridge that connected Cape Refuge to Tybee Island , his mind raced with the faces of teenage girls who 'd grown up here . Whoever this girl was , the murder would have a rippling effect , shattering her family and shaking her friends . There would be a life-size hole in the heart of the small town . He found the site and pulled up to the squad cars parked there . One of the Tybee officers met him as he got out . " Oh , it 's you , Chief Cade . I did n't recognize you in your truck . " " Where 's Chief Grant ? " he asked . The man pointed to the riverbank , and Cade saw him with the medical examiner looking over the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grass . She was small , maybe a hundred pounds , and looked as if someone had carefully laid her down there , her arms out from her body , her knees together and bent to the side . In the flickering blue light , he could n't yet see her face , and her hair was wet , long ... He walked closer , and Keith Parker , the medical examiner , looked up at him . " Hey , Cade . You recognize her ? " Chief Grant handed him a flashlight , and Cade stooped down and illuminated her face . His heart plunged . She was Alan Lawrence 's girl , Emily . She could n't be more than sixteen . Cade did n't think she 'd even gotten her license yet . Anger stung his eyes , and he rubbed his jaw . His throat was tight as he swallowed . Who could have done this ? Who would have wanted to end the life of an innocent , sweet girl whose parents loved her ? He cleared his throat . " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marie . " He paused , trying to steady his voice . " You know the cause of death ? " " Gunshot , " Grant said . " Looks like she was shot in another location , then apparently brought here and put into that boat . Your man found her . " Cade stood and looked in the direction Grant nodded . Scott Crown stood with the other cops , answering questions . His uniform was wet , and he looked shaken and nervous . Cade felt sorry for the kid . Odds were he had n't expected to find a dead girl his first week on the job . " Unfortunately , " the Tybee chief went on , " your man compromised the evidence . Moved the body out of the boat before he called us . Got her wet trying to get her onto the shore . Who knows what evidence might have been washed off ? I would think you 'd train your people better than that . " Cade 's anger shifted from the faceless killer to the rookie . " What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be patrolling Cape Refuge . " " He saw the boat floating in the river between the two islands , saw that someone was in it . Right then he should have called my department instead of coming onto my turf and handling the matter himself . " Cade sighed and looked toward the kid again . He 'd had reservations about hiring someone so young right out of the academy , but Crown was Joe McCormick 's nephew . When his detective vouched for the kid , Cade decided to give him the benefit of the doubt . But he 'd recognized Crown 's hero complex his first day on the job . He was something of a loose cannon , and Cade had wondered if he could trust him to follow the rules . Apparently , he could n't . He crossed the grass toward Crown . The kid turned , saw him , and burst into his explanation . " Chief , I know I did wrong . It was stupid . I do n't even know what I was thinking . But there were vultures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat ... I crossed the bridge and came over here- " " Your first mistake , " Cade said . " But if I had n't , they might not have found her ! " " Crown , if you had called Tybee to tell them what you saw , they would have been there in minutes . Not only did you step outside of our jurisdiction , but you botched up the evidence . " The kid looked at the cops around him , as if humiliated that he 'd been reamed in front of them . " I did n't botch it up . " " Yes , you did ! I know they taught you in the academy never to move a body . And then you go and wash off the evidence ! " In the light of the police cars ' headlights , he could see the kid 's face turning red . " Okay , I 'm sorry ! I got out to the boat and recognized Emily . I was n't sure she was dead . I was trying to save her ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat ! " " Right . " Crown 's voice rose as he shot back . " So let me get this straight . Next time I see a girl dying in a boat , I 'm supposed to sit on my hands until the right people get there ? I thought we were emergency personnel . I thought it was our job to save lives ! " Crown was livid , stepping over his bounds . Clearly , Cade was n't going to teach him anything right here in front of his peers . Besides , there was a dead girl lying there-and a killer to be identified . He did n't have time to deal with the rookie . " Go back to the station , Crown . Wait for me there . " " I do n't want to go back . I found her ! " Cade stepped nose-to-nose with the kid , speaking through his teeth . " Now , Crown . If I hear one more word , you 're fired . " Crown backed down then and , without another word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drove away , then breathed a frustrated sigh and turned back to the body . Emily . He remembered watching her at the Hanover House Easter egg hunt when she was three . She 'd practically tripped over the " hidden " eggs and celebrated when she found her first one , while those around her snatched up all the rest . Who would want her dead ? He went back to his car and radioed in . " Chief Cade here . Get all available units to secure the bank of the Bull River across from where the body was found . I do n't want anyone traipsing through there until I have a chance to get over there . We do n't know which side the boat was put in on . " The radio crackled , and Myrtle 's voice rasped across the airwaves . " Will do , Chief . " As she began radioing the other cars on duty , he went back to the body and stooped down next to the medical examiner . " Where 's the gunshot wound , Keith ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No exit wound , so it probably did n't happen at close range . The bullet 's still in there . But she was shot hours ago . Bled out before she was put into the boat . " Cade stood , a sick feeling twisting in his gut as he anticipated having to go to her home and break the news to her parents . They might not even know she was missing yet . If they 'd gone to bed before her curfew , they would n't know until morning . But if they were more diligent , as he knew Alan was , they might be up even now , waiting to confront her when she came in . In a million years , they would never expect news like this . He wished he was in charge of the investigation , but the murder had n't happened on his turf . Still , he looked over the body as the medical examiner knelt beside her . " That a bruise on her jaw ? " Cade asked . " Yep . Several more on her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at this . " He pointed to the chafed skin around her mouth . " Looks like duct tape was pulled off of her mouth and wrists . " It had clearly been an abduction . Cade looked across the dark water . Was there a murderer still lurking on his island , looking for young girls ? " We need to notify the family , Cade . " He turned to Grant . " I 'll do it . They 're friends of mine . " " I 'm waiting for the GBI to get here . I 'll need their help on this . " Cade knew the GBI , Georgia 's Bureau of Investigation , had the resources to solve this case . He was glad they 'd been notified so early . " One of our detectives is going to need to go through her room , see what we can find , " Grant said . " If you can just break the news to the parents , then my detective or the state 's men can take it from there . " Right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way . " That 's fine . I 'll seal off her room , make sure nobody goes in there . " He strode back to his truck , trying to get his head together . How was he going to break it to them ? The muscles in the back of his neck were rock hard , and his jaw hurt as he ground his teeth together . What would he say ? How would he phrase it ? Lord , give me the words . As he drove his pickup back to Cape Refuge , Cade rehearsed the hated speech in his mind . Alan and Marie , I 'm afraid I have some bad news ... ( Continues ... )
