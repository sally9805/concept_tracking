Herman Melville A Biography Volume 2 , 1851-1891 By Hershel Parker THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY PRESS London Literary Gazette , 6 December 1851 The first volume of this biography ends with Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne in the dining room of the Little Red Inn at Lenox , Massachusetts , on an afternoon in mid-November 1851 . There Melville had been holding his publication party for Moby-Dick , to which he had invited a single guest . The two authors had shocked Lenox by dining in public in a village where by custom the hotel was for guests only , and the indigenous yokels ( according to a new resident ) had taken turns peeking in at them , sure that the two most notoriously reclusive literary men in the county had perversely chosen this indecorous way of meeting each other instead of going to Melville 's Arrowhead outside Pittsfield or Hawthorne 's rented little red cottage outside Lenox . The local belles and beaux , the newcomer wrote some weeks later , had found long-lasting amusement in this peculiar attempt at acquaintanceship between such dissimilar men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free-and-easy Melville , author of Typee and Omoo , books which had made him the first American literary sex symbol . There , alone in the dining room after the hotel guests had dined , the two had lingered with the first presentation copy of Moby-Dick while Hawthorne accustomed himself to the astounding dedication : " In token of my admiration for his genius , This Book is Inscribed to Nathaniel Hawthorne . " Afterward they had made their farewells , for Hawthorne , unknown to most of the townspeople , was leaving the Berkshires . The hours in the dining room had been sacred , but the day itself was miserable . The weather had been " of the most dreary sort " ( as Melville 's neighbor Sarah Morewood wrote on 21 November to their New York friend George Duyckinck ) . Sleet , hail , and snow squalls , varied by " high winds leaden skies , " had battered the county for weeks . The year before , the glorious Berkshire autumn had seemed endless . This year , ice on the limbs had already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads alternated with patches of frozen snow and ice that made it " really unsafe for a horse to travel , " Sarah had decided the day before , when she abandoned a drive and returned " to the mud and slush of the Lenox road , " which ran by the Morewood estate , previously the farm of Melville 's uncle Thomas Melvill . In front of the storm , across the state in eastern Massachusetts , rumors were swirling like wind-whipped snowflakes . The Lynn News gossiped that Hawthorne intended to move among its shoemakers " and to build a house on the beautiful range of hills in the western part of that city " ( a report the Evening Commonwealth spread throughout Boston on 22 November ) . The truth was more prosaic , for the Hawthornes were taking temporary occupancy of the house of Horace Mann during his term in Congress , Mary Mann being Sophia Hawthorne 's sister . This second volume opens a day or two after the meeting in the Little Red Inn , around 14 November ( the official publication date of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the author but with the dedicatee , and with the book . Nathaniel Hawthorne sat with his copy of Moby-Dick in his study in the little red cottage above Stockbridge Bowl where he had written The House of the Seven Gables under the gaze of Emerson 's gift , a print of Raphael 's transfigured Jesus . Now the inside of the little red cottage was as bleak as the winter landscape . Honored by Melville 's dedicating the book to him , Hawthorne was determined to respond fittingly , even in a chaotic household , by reading it at once and writing Melville about it . Despite his views on equal parenting , he left Sophia to take care of the baby while she packed their possessions with the dubious intermittent assistance of the obstreperous older children , Una and Julian . She was already putting away smaller household items , perhaps including Emerson 's gift . A few days earlier , the transfigured Jesus would have scrutinized the pages of Moby-Dick over Hawthorne 's shoulder all the hours he read ; as it was , the book would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with intellectual women , Herman Melville admired Sophia Peabody Hawthorne uncritically and idealized her relationship with her husband . In the same household where Ellery Channing weeks before had witnessed mismanagement , bad parenting , and misanthropy , Melville saw a mutually supportive marriage beyond any ideal he could hope to attain . For her part , Sophia had looked forward to the publication of what her husband called The White Whale in his A Wonder-Book , itself published in early November . She admired Melville , she revelled in the honor he bestowed upon her husband by his uncharacteristic openness , and she identified with the exotic eroticism of Typeeto the point of visualizing the naked Fayaway when she first looked upon Melville . In the middle of November 1851 , however , and not for the first time , Melville had inconvenienced Sophia . She was far from a competent and gracious hostess , and Melville could be less than an ideal guest . He had a way of showing up unexpectedly , as he had just done when he hauled Hawthorne off to the Little Red Inn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he ate too much without assessing the total number of available tea-cakes before he enjoyed them . He gestured too much and talked too much , exhausting Sophia even while exhilarating her . No matter how much she liked having him there once she had adjusted to his arrival , she never regretted when it came time for him to leave . Now Moby-Dick , his latest cargo of " rare and costly merchandise " ( one of her phrases about Melville 's writings , from 1852 ) , with its exalting dedication , made her a martyr , for she could not stop to read it herself and her husband perforce must stop to read it , or at least to read enough to write a proper letter about it . All the time her husband was putting everything aside to turn the pages of Moby-Dick , Sophia was doing all the packing and all the child-minding herself . Under the circumstances , Hawthorne must have shared with Sophia the private joke put there for them at the end of " The Street " ( ch. 6 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong musk that their sailor sweethearts could smell them miles offshore , but he did not dawdle to reread all the striking passages or to identify teasing language that echoed many different books of the Bible and a throng of British writers , foremost and midmost of whom was Shakespeare . No earlier than 15 November , and more likely the sixteenth , Hawthorne wrote Melville a long letter of heartfelt praise . When Melville wrote to Sophia Hawthorne several weeks later , after she had read the book herself , he claimed that her husband 's letter about Moby-Dick had taught him how to read some parts of his own book : " I had some vague idea while writing it , that the whole book was susceptible of an allegoric construction , &; also that parts of it werebut the speciality of many of the particular subordinate allegories , were first revealed to me , after reading Mr Hawthorne 's letter , which , without citing any particular examples , yet intimated the part- &-parcel; allegoricalness of the whole . " Unwontedly reckless in his emotional and intellectual response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedication its true significance , Hawthorne had offered in his letter to review Moby-Dick , repayment in kind for Melville 's momentous two-part essay on Mosses from an Old Manse in late August 1850 in the New York Literary World , edited by Evert and George Duyckinck . The Hawthornes , like the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , Hawthorne 's college friend , were sure that the essay , signed " By a Virginian Spending July in Vermont , " had marked a turning point in Hawthorne 's national recognition . After his day 's stint of writing , Melville 's habit was to drive from Arrowhead , his farm on the middle road to Lenox , to pick up his mail at the post office in the village of Pittsfield . On 16 November , a Sunday , someone handed Hawthorne 's letter to him as he was driving with his sisters Helen , Kate , and Fanny to visit Rowland and Sarah Morewood , the new owners of the farm that had been Herman 's " first love , " a cousin said in 1848 . Melville 's next-younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matriarch , Maria Gansevoort Melville , was left at Arrowhead to care for his son Malcolm , almost two , and for his very sick wife , Elizabeth ( Lizzie ) Shaw Melville , who despite a breast infection was still nursing the three-week-old Stanwix , the Melvilles ' second child . Melville read Hawthorne 's letter " there , " as he put it , leaving uncertain whether enough daylight had remained for him to read it on the road or whether he waited until he had light at the Morewoods ' house , where he had written a little of Moby-Dick the year before . Wherever he read Hawthorne 's letter , he had to stifle his joy throughout the evening . He would have suppressed his feelings even in a small family group , but at the Morewood house there were other guests besides the Melvilles , so he pocketed the letter and said nothing about it . Through November , Sarah and the English-born Rowland Morewood had been " living in the midst of confusion , " as she wrote to George Duyckinck on 21 November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to gain a large dining room , the one room where Sarah most required spaciousness . Neither household confusion nor early pregnancy checked her compulsion to entertain , and on this occasion the host , hostess , and guests amused themselves by drawing lots for names of the Morewood house and cows . Long afterward , the Morewoods ' daughter Annie , not yet born in 1851 , pasted into a scrapbook a newspaper clipping from the 1880s on " The Name of Broadhall " : " it was decided that each person present should drop a name in a box and the first drawn out should be accepted . Herman Melville , the famous author of Omoo , Typee , etc. , wrote the name of Broadhall on his slip and it was drawn out and accepted with applause . " Melville as the namer of " Broadhall " was the small stuff of local literary legend , the sort that had begun to stick to his Berkshire behavior like lichens . Sarah 's account to George Duyckinck on 21 November credits him with the rhyming bovine names but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends were spending the evening with usMr Melville and three of his sisters among the numberwe agreed by way of amusement to write names for our cows and houseand to decide by drawing lotsI drew for the house Broadhallfor the three cowsMolly Polly &; Dolly . Miss Kate Melville had the naming of the houseHerman Melville the cows . " Kate 's suggestion of " Broadhall " was not original , for the poet and novelist Cornelius Mathews had celebrated " the great rooms of Broad Hall " in the Literary World the year before . One of the guests who had been in Pittsfield then , while Kate was in New York , may have prompted herperhaps Melville , perhaps the local manufacturer John C. Hoadley , who was courting her by this time . Melville , the new master of Shakespearean prose , had outdone himself with the simplicity of Molly , Polly , and Dolly ( whatever complication lurked in the fact that " Dolly " was one of his pet names for his wife ) . During the evening his repressed joy broke out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host . Later , upon reflection , Rowland decided that he liked his neighbor better the more he saw of him , except that his " opinions and religious views " were expressed too frequently in " irreverent language " ( as his wife wrote to George Duyckinck , 28 December ) . Between such outbursts , Melville sat in an inward rapture , Hawthorne 's letter in his pocket , in the old parlor where he had sat with his father and uncle , and with his older brother , now dead , and with cousins now dead . Later , suffused with triumph , he sat in the strangely enlarged dining room . Molly , Polly , and Dolly named , he lived those hours as one of " God 's true princes of the Empire " ( Moby-Dick , ch. 33 ) . The setting was not inappropriate for such a conqueror , for his Grandfather Melvill had bought the house for the residence of Melville 's Uncle Thomas , who held the contracts for feeding and clothing the British prisoners in the cantonment during the second war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pride to the miniature ship made by men his uncle called " my Prisoners in the last war " ( in a letter to Judge Lemuel Shaw , 14 January 1842 ) . The farm , strongly associated with the defeat of the British , was also strangely associated with the French empire ( the " Tuileries and the Taghconics , " Melville wrote ) , because Thomas Melvill had so often reminisced , there in Broadhall , of " martial displays and spectacles of state which he had witnessed in Paris in the time of the first Napoleon " ( " Sketch of Major Thomas Melville Junior by a Nephew " ) . Melville himself had witnessed later , and contrasting , phases of British and French imperialism with his own eyes . He was on the spot in 1842 when the French seized the Marquesas Islands and , later , Tahiti . During his whaling years the Pacific islands had been there for the taking , he knew . The British had taken control of the Sandwich Islands to forestall the French , and he had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the day the British formally relinquished the islands , under pressure from President John Tyler , who five years later , in 1848 , had sat in the same Broadhall parlor and eaten in the old , smaller dining room . Melville had witnessed American imperialism , also , for he had returned home in time to hear the last of his brother Gansevoort 's orations advocating the election of James K. Polk and the immediate annexation of Texas . Melville had written Omoo ( 1847 ) and started Mardi ( 1849 ) during the war with Mexico , which gained the United States vast tracts of what he called in " Loomings " the " great American desert " ( Moby-Dick , ch. 1 ) . In 1848 Melville had read accounts of the gold fever in California and had written the start of the Gold Rush into Mardi . By 1849 thousands of gold-seekers had been making the dangerous voyage around the Horn or chancing the terrifying passage over the Isthmus of Panama , before a railroad was built , and all the while Melville wrote Moby-Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter in his pocket , ordinary Americans were crossing the continent to California in wagons , on horseback , and on foot . While he wrote Moby-Dick , California became a state . After California , what then ? In Moby-Dick ( ch. 89 ) , Melville had just defined imperialism in whaling terms : " What to that apostolic lancer , Brother Jonathan , is Texas but a Fast-Fish ? " What was Mexico to the United States ? A Loose-Fish , as yet , except for the territories already seized or purchased . He had foreseen ( ch. 14 ) the time when America would " add Mexico to Texas , and pile Cuba upon Canada " in its piratical acquisitiveness . Better than any other American of his generation , Melville knew geopolitics as a humble but reflective observer and as a pondering autodidact . This man who now saw the world in terms of " linked analogies " ( Moby-Dick , ch. 70 ) had known , as early as 1848 , and believed passionately in 1850 and 1851 , that literary greatness was there for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been just a few years earlier . American literary greatness had been a Loose-Fish that Melville in his whaling book had made a Fast-Fish forever . Such a book would create a great sensation and allow him to pay off the $2050 he had secretly borrowed from a Lansingburgh friend the previous May and make him a free man , financiallyif he did not take account of what he owed Harper &; Brothers , his American publisher , and Dr. John Brewster , the former owner of his house , Arrowhead . ( He never counted what did not need to be repaidwhat his father-in-law , Lemuel Shaw , the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts , had advanced for the purchase of a lease on a house on Fourth Avenue in 1847 and toward the purchase of Arrowhead in 1850 , or what his current British publisher , Richard Bentley , had lost on Mardi , Redburn , and White-Jacket , Melville 's most recent books , before Moby-Dick . ) ( Continues ... )              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
