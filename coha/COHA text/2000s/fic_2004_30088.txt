Chapter One no quiet today " Hold on tight , " Radmer says , too late to do any good . The first air pocket comes and goes like a kick on the guts . Whump ! Radmer is old enough more than old enough to remember the fiery slam and tumble of entering a planetary atmosphere from orbit . The howl of plasma , the glow of radiators ... Piercing the atmosphere of Lune is nothing like that . For one thing , he 's coming in under four kps , so there is heat but not fire . For another thing his vehicle is not some graceful , gull-winged shuttle , but a crude sphere of brass , navigated by eyeball and sextant and steered with charges of dinite explosive . Inertial stability comes , in theory , from a gyroscope made of a potter 's wheel , but Radmer has been too busy steering to kick the thing and wind it up . Beyond the bootside porthole , he can see the world of Lune spinning crazily . The Squozen Moon : a world crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in orbit around the pinpoint collapsar of Murdered Earth . Lune is so much smaller than a real planet . More delicate , more precious , and yet the largest by far the largest of the habitable worlds still bathing in the light of Sol . No longer whispering , the air is dense enough now to sing and screech against the hull of the sphere . But even from this altitude , deep into the atmosphere now , this world looks small and very round . Because it is : barely 1400 kilometers across . The size of a province , an inland sea , a large hurricane . Not quite to human scale , but nearly . Nearly . In the two-hundred and first decade of the death of the Queendom of Sol , in a space capsule made by armorers and watchmakers and artillerymen , General Emeritus Radmer once the architect Conrad Ethel Mursk is preparing to land in the province of Apenine , in the nation of Imbria , on this tiny world of Lune . Or hoping to , anyway . Where exactly he comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghastly-With a bump and a screech , the brass sphere hits another air pocket , an eddy in the storms of the upper atmosphere , and Radmer 's payload-his most precious of cargoes is thrown hard against its restraints . The capsule whirls . Then there 's another bump , and another , even harder one , and the screech of air is louder than ever , and Radmer realizes they 're not in the upper atmosphere at all . They 've just punched through into the troposphere . Where the weather lives . The clouds are sparse today in this particular location , but they form a definite deck , a stratum of atmosphere rushing upward with visible speed . As the brass sphere spins down toward it , Radmer can not help worrying that the rough ride will damage the payload . That would be bad very bad for the course of the war , because this particular payload has cost lives and fortunes to retrieve from the empty tropical paradise of the planette Varna . " Is n't there a parachute ? " the payload asks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The payload is a human being , yes a man with ancient and critical knowledge about the way things used to work . He is older than Radmer by several hundred years , and looks it . It seems incredible criminal ! to subject his wizened frame to this jerking , hammering fall through the sky , but the world of Lune will not save itself . It is up to these ancient men , these Olders , to do what they can . Radmer can not pop the parachute because they are still too high , and the air too thin . Even if the chute opened fully , which he 's not at all sure it would , the capsule could drift on the trade winds for hundreds of miles . And if they come down outside the borders of Imbria , then Radmer and the payload are in deep shit indeed . But Radmer has got to do something about this tumbling , or when he does open the chute it will foul , and kill them both with even greater certainty . He has landed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small planette . Lune is a much realer world , unforgiving of error . " Rip another oxygen candle , " he tells the payload , just to keep him busy . Then he leans his own seat forward and begins , finally , kicking the potter 's wheel . The thing has wound down completely . It will take fifty kicks just to get the springs engaged . And after that , several minutes of steady kicking , steady spinning , to store the energy of his muscles in the flywheel made by Highrock potters and inserted into the capsule by master clockmaker Orange Mayhew . Hopefully , by the time Radmer does pop the chute , the inertia of the spinning disc will have stabilized the capsule somewhat . If not , there are other tricks he can try : spinning the hull against the sphere 's fixed inner platform , or even God help them popping open the hatch to serve as a kind of fin or rudder . Dutifully , the payload loosens his harness , leans back his seat , opens the cabinet behind him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel canister of an oxygen candle , clutches it between his legs , then closes the cabinet and readjusts his seat and straps . " This is the last of them , " the payload says . " That 's fine , " Radmer answers distractedly . It does n't matter . At this point they will either land safely or die , and the freshness of the air will make no difference at all . But the payload pulls the canister 's ripcord just the same , then holds on for a minute , feeling for the heat of the iron/chlorate reaction . Then , satisfied , he pulls the old canister out of its niche and places the new one where it sat , pulling down the bracket to hold it in place . Then he leans back , opens the cabinet again , and places the spent canister where the fresh one had sat . This task requires no great genius to accomplish , but Radmer is relieved by the sight of it nonetheless . The payload can still learn , still reason , still take on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is good news indeed : he is not one of the indeceased , the Olders whose neural pathways have simply worn out . Over the fifty-seven hours of their voyage and the weeks of preparation that preceded it , Radmer has felt some doubt on this point . The two of them had quickly run out of conversation , and without it the old man retreated into a kind of stupor , simply waiting for something to happen . But perhaps this was merely patience . One does not live long not this long without patience . " I may throw up , " the payload warns . " I 'm not accustomed to this spinning . To any movement , I suppose . " " Go ahead if you must , " Radmer says . " But I would rather you watched the ground for glints . " " Glints ? " " Of light . The sunlight reflecting from our enemies as they move across the landscape . If it 's all the same to you , sir , to the extent that we can steer this tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hmm . I see . " And perhaps he does . The details of the war seem to slide off him without effect , but the gist of it can not be too hard to grasp . He leans forward to peer through the porthole . While the payload is absorbed in this task , Radmer winds the wheel and winds it , and winds it some more . And indeed , the tumbling of the craft has begun to slow , its momentum soaked up by the wheel . He would of course need three wheels , arranged at right angles , to really stabilize the capsule . Or if he had the time , he could reorient the entire ship and soak up angular momentum on each axis singly . But even without any of that , this humble mechanism works surprisingly well . Perhaps the chute will not foul . " There is a mountain , " the payload says . Radmer looks down , follows the old man 's gaze . Indeed , he can make out of the green sprawl of the Aden Plateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief flicker of whiteness , the cloud layer comes and goes . The capsule has fallen a long way , tens of thousands of kilometers . Now it is barely a kilometer from the high ground of the plateau , and it truly is time to deploy the parachute . Radmer gathers up the chains that control it , stares out the window for a moment , then yanks hard . The parachute doors clang open , and the drogue snaps in the breeze for a moment before hauling the orange-and-white silk of the main chute out behind it . Radmer can feel but not see the canopy as it inflates , and the capsule jerks as if caught by something springy . The lines of twisted , vacuum-weakened hemp creak with sudden strain , but decide to hold . So . Aden Plateau , an uninhabited area , is not where Radmer had intended to land . But things could be worse ; the city of Timoch is only twenty-two kilometers beyond the bluff 's easternmost edge , so perhaps his navigational abilities or his luck are not as hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are carrying the capsule to that edge . It appears , in fact , that the capsule will land on the slopes of the plateau , rather than on its flat summit . This is extremely dangerous , because there will be nothing to prevent the capsule from rolling down a sixty-degree slope two kilometers long . Aye , and a battering tumble like that could easily kill the payload , not to mention strange thought Radmer himself . His steering authority is virtually nil , but with no better prospects at hand , he tugs the chains to pull in one side of the chute , to encourage both a slow curl to the west and a more rapid descent . To race , in effect , against this unlucky wind . The effect is subtle but definite . Using the plateau 's eastern watchtower as a reference , he can gauge his change of course and see with considerable relief that it is enough . The capsule will stay clear of the edge , and alight on the plateau 's flat upper surface . Unfortunately , Aden is grassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cushion their fall . They come down just thirty meters to the west of the tower , and they hit the ground hard with a clang of metal and a whump of dirt and begin rolling at once . The view through the portholes is more confusing than informative as the whirling edge of the precipice looms , as the brass sphere wraps itself up in silk and parachute cords . But again luck seems to favor them : the inner platform remains stable , and with it the men themselves , who do n't even get dizzy while the capsule rolls right up against the old watchtower 's metal fence . And though the fence groans and falls back in protest , the capsule stops dead , fully ten meters from the drop-off . They have arrived . Radmer has completed an interplanetary mission . An interplanette mission anyway using little more than a bridge and some pulleys , he and the artisans of Highrock have hurled this capsule at the sky , and then with dinite he 's blasted it back off the surface of Varna , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it all worked . Not quite according to plan , but well enough . " Sorry , " Radmer says , fighting a sudden wash of fatigue . " Welcome to Lune , sir . " " Hmm , " the payload answers , peering around him uncertainly . Feeling the crush of gravity again , the insistent tug on limbs and jowls and eyelashes . He flexes an arm experimentally . " It feels ... different . " " What does ? " Radmer asks . " The gradient ? " Lune , like Varna , was squozen to the point of Earthlike gravity and no farther . But the radius of Varna is three thousand times smaller ; its gravity drops off much more rapidly with altitude . Still , Radmer had never felt that difference , or imagined that it could be felt . The payload nods , though . " Yes , the gradient . This world is ... large . " And since his name Bruno de Towaji is virtually synonymous with the study of gravity , and the interrelationships of gravity with electricity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe him . " It 's a long time , " the payload says , " since I felt the tug of a flat surface . But there 's something right and proper about it , is n't there ? Now , I do n't mean to sound ungrateful , but you must get me outside . I need to stand ; I need to breathe . " " As do I , " Radmer assures him . Throwing off his harness , he drops to the curved hull beside the payload 's chair , grabs the slick brass handle of the hatch , and turns it . There is a sound , not unlike a gasp of surprise , as the inner and outer airs mingle . And then gravity is pulling the hatch inward and down , and daylight floods the sphere 's interior with jagged pools of light and shadow . The capsule is cold inside , and the winter air of Apenine is colder still , though blissfully fresh as it oozes inside , pressed and tugged by a wind which sings against the hull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Towaji . " A standard precaution in time of war ; your life is vastly more important than my own . " Amused , the old man snorts . " That remains to be seen , lad . But out with you ; I 'm right behind . " Stepping out into the cold wind , Radmer stretches and yawns , then groans . Looking up , he sees right away that the watchtower has been ransacked . The enemy 's forces do not burn , do not pillage per se , but in their quest for anything made of metal they have torn the tower apart , sundering its floors , scattering and pulverizing its contents . Little remains except the base of the outer shell itself , all cut stone and poured concrete . " They have been here , " he says . " Recently . " " Your enemies ? " the payload asks , stepping up beside him to survey the damage . " Yours now as well , " Radmer corrects . " I 'm sorry , sir , but they will likely kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payload says thoughtfully . " Or perhaps not . " To the east , the city of Timoch is visible in all its glory , a cluster of towers surrounding the Central Lake , with smaller buildings sprawling around it for many kilometers in a starburst of arrow-straight roads . In time , the sprawling , spreading city might have reached the slopes of Aden Plateau itself , had this bitter war not intervened . Almost ten million people live here . And on Lune , that makes it a big city indeed . " That 's the city of Timoch , " Radmer says . But de Towaji is n't even looking . His eyes are to the south . " There are glints of light , " he says . Radmer looks . Damn . The reflections are plainly visible in the midday sun , probably a squad of twenty . Radmer 's luck which has held remarkably well up to now has finally run out . But a glance back in de Towaji 's direction reveals the old man now studying the sky with that same slack interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radmer asks impatiently . The payload says nothing for a moment and then murmurs , " Such a beautiful day . One forgets what a real sky is supposed to look like , so pale . Why , the horizon is nearly as white as the clouds ! And to think , the sky of Earth was paler and brighter still . Terrible about the Earth , is n't it ? How I miss that place , that enormous collection of places . Forged by God himself .
