Truth and Consequences ALLAN SLOAN 'S " House of Junk " ( Oct. 29 ) , on GSAMP , is by far the most intelligent , best-reported explanation of the financial consequences and financial practices of securitization of mortgage loans that has been printed or published anywhere . In a part of the world that I think I know something about , I learned a tremendous amount from the details of his research . It 's a superb piece of reporting on a really unbelievable story . MORT ZUCKERMAN Chairman of the Board , Boston Properties New York City More on Mortgages YOUR ARTICLE concludes that " when you rely on the underwriter and the rating agencies to do all your homework for you , you do n't have safety . You have only the illusion of safety . " For Goldman Sachs to underwrite the issue and then arrange a hedge not only to offset losses but to generate profits when investors are losing money is fraudulent . There is nothing in your article that suggests that the underwriter disclosed this conflict of interest . The underwriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AARON E. MICHEL Charlotte " HOUSE OF JUNK " is a brilliant account of the subprime mess . I am a mortgage broker in Florida . The greed  --  from mortgage brokers to Wall Street  --  is incredible . When I was in the auto-and-trucks leasing business , we bought and sold portfolios , but they were scrutinized for creditworthiness and the amount remaining on the leases . The most important part of the article , which I saw nowhere else , was on second mortgages . You 're right on the money when you say the second-mortgage holder is really stuck : He ca n't foreclose if payments on the first mortgage are current , unless he buys it out . And if the first mortgage starts to foreclose , he has to buy it out to protect his interest in the second . What a mess . LEONARD SHAPIRO Boynton Beach , Fla . KUDOS TO YOU for " House of Junk . " Clear , concise , well analyzed . Once again it is shown that there is no free lunch  --  except , perhaps , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go , Gators ! AS A FLORIDA alum and Gator Booster ( " The Biggest Gators in the Swamp , " Oct. 29 ) , I thank you for your unbiased report on the University of Florida athletic program ( and your equally unbiased comment about Tennessee ) . We Gator supporters are so fortunate to have a president , Bernie Machen , who understands the importance of sports in the lives of the students and the Florida alums ; athletic director Jeremy Foley , who is a proven expert at gauging the future success of a coach ; and Gator Boosters executive director John James , who gets us to go happily , cheerfully , even joyfully to our bank accounts to support the U. of F. athletic program . RUTH S. WAGNER West Palm Beach , Fla . Fiorina on Fiorina REGARDLESS OF who deserves the credit for Hewlett-Packard 's current success , the dancing in the halls of HP to celebrate Carly Fiorina 's departure is not just urban myth ( " Questions for Carly Fiorina , " Oct. 29 ) . Having good or even great business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader is not able to develop a loyal , dedicated , and enthusiastic cadre of employees at all levels of the company . Fiorina got what she deserved . It 's just too bad the solid-gold parachute did n't hit her harder on the way out the door . STAN GAGE Portola Valley , Calif . CARLY FIORINA seems to be living in a permanent state of denial . As a 28-year Hewlett-Packard veteran who recently left the company , I think virtually none of the business initiatives launched during her tenure could be considered successful , with the possible exception of the Compaq acquisition . Carly is a saleswoman , pure and simple . At HP she was the master of the " grand announcement " with no follow-through on whether her staff was implementing anything . She was very aware of her public image and went to great lengths to keep it sharpened . She willfully neglected operational details , but she covers her backside with " I trusted the wrong people . " Fiorina came along at a time when HP needed a new CEO . It just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three years sooner . DAVE MONTGOMERY Cupertino , Calif . SO FIORINA 's biggest mistake was letting someone onto the HP board whom she should n't have . Obviously , my biggest mistake is assuming company boards are supposed to approve the choice of who runs the company , rather than the other way around . Next time I receive a proxy , I will be eagerly looking for the box where I can mark my vote for or against the president and CEO . RALPH BOARDMAN Gatineau , Qubec Tax Oil for Alaska 's Gas IF EVERY STATE had trillions of cubic feet of gas , it would make sense to offer the oil companies a tax incentive to come to your state to get it ( " Alaska 's Governor Gets Tough With Big Oil , " Oct. 29 ) . But in this case , Alaska has a unique commodity . If anything , Alaska should charge a surplus tax for the privilege of profiting from its gas reserves . The state should name a price or ask for bids  --  and watch the oil companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right . If anything , she should charge the oil companies normal rates plus a surplus tax . RICK HYER Troy , Mo . Health Begins at Home EXCELLENT ARTICLE on health care ( " Check Your Pulse , and the Dow , " Value Driven , Oct. 15 ) . Market performance and the health of corporate America are key . But when will we wake up and realize that a lot of our health problems are due to lack of exercise , obesity , and shoveling the wrong foods into our mouths ? People need to be held responsible for their lifestyles . The U.S. already has taxes on alcohol and tobacco . Why not on fattening foods ? JIM WAGNER Anaheim Rating Business News I TAKE ISSUE with a reference to CNBC 's " monopoly here in the U.S. " in your cover story ( " Rupert 's Bigtime TV Gamble : Inside Fox Business News , " Oct. 29 ) . PBS 's Nightly Business Report enjoys an average of nearly 750,000 viewers each weeknight ( and more than 2.6 million different viewers each week ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nightly Business Report 's daily audience is more than twice as large as that for any of CNBC 's signature programs , such as Closing Bell . Indeed , Nightly Business Report pioneered daily business news on TV ten years before CNBC even signed on . And after more than 28 years on the air , it is still the most watched daily business news program on American television . STUART ZUCKERMAN VP , Sales and Marketing Nightly Business Report New York City African Leadership YOUR EXCELLENT take on business leadership in the Oct. 1 issue ( " Leadership 2007 " ) contained one significant flaw : Your " worldwide " research failed to pay attention to Africa . The future script for global leadership will largely be written by Africa and Asia . Corporate leadership in Africa is tough , and there are several noteworthy models and practices emerging .
