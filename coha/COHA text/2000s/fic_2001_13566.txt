FLYING LESSONS COLOMBA On the morning of September eleventh , I remember eyeing a handsome , grey dove who was perched on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shocked the dove was there as I had n't seen him for several weeks , and I never in my wildest thoughts would 've expected to see him again . As I stared at him , I reflected on the wonderful vacation my husband and I had arrived home from on Sunday night , September ninth . We had visited Sicily for the sole purpose of seeing ancient Greco/Roman theaters ( and to stuff our faces ) . We saw nine theaters in all ! Only one , the Odeon in Catania , was built to be enclosed . The other eight theaters were meant to be in the open air ! Each spot was enchanting , and the trip was fantastically romantic ! Never would I have thought that just several hours later , I 'd be taking a **29;1127;TOOLONG turn in mood . The attacks in America wrecked my pleasant reflection . Though , thankfully , no one in my life was directly affected by the events , I felt my capacity for happiness zap from me . I kept telling myself I should be grateful that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly grateful . But the feelings were bittersweet at best . I felt myself getting uncontrollably emotional . I could not get the apocalyptic images of the terrorist attacks out of my head . My husband and I do not own a television , so , the images were in my head literally . I desperately tried to contact my husband at his office , but all the circuits were busy . My telephone is right near the window , so I kept peering outside . Then something caught my eye . The handsome grey dove had company . As I jerked my head to observe who 'd joined him , a tear seemed to fly from my left eye . It landed smack on a window pane where it proceeded to glisten and seemed to listen like an ear at a door . Directly below it , outside , were two tiny , shaggy , pewter-colored dove chicks , snoozing in not the best nest . I recalled how both my husband and I had noticed the nest before we went to Sicily , and we had joked about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thick , nor intricately woven like any other nest we 'd seen . Instead , it consisted of odd-and-end twigs thrown together like a game of pick-up-sticks . The ledge the nest was built on was just the width of a brick ( which is what the ledge is made of ) . We concluded that male doves build silly , pseudo roosts , so that a few hours a day they can just kick back . Wrong ! The handsome male was a beautiful female who 'd given birth while we were away . I had n't noticed this development on September tenth . . . the day before , as my jet-lag kept me from getting to the dining room until after dark . The grey dove proceeded to slip on over to the flat makeshift nest and plop herself on top of the two scrawny chicks . No man would do that . And it appeared as if the chicks were being smothered . But the dove was just being a mother . She was keeping them snug . I immediately called my husband to hear his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't reach him . The circuits were still busy . I continued to bird-watch for about an hour . The mother dove looked at me with what seemed to be peripheral vision ( but I 'm a serious layman when it comes to bird behavior ) . She was extremely protective , which I was relieved to see , but I secretly , perhaps selfishly wished that I 'd felt more welcome . My dining room window , storm window , and rusty bug screen served as a hefty wedge between me and the birds . At the time , the screen really seemed chicken-coopish . After the mother dove diligently groomed her chicks ( I imagined she thought I contaminated them with my interest ) , she simply breathed . I watched all of them breathe deeply for quite a while . In the midst of obsessively trying to reach my husband , it was actually placating . When my husband finally came to our Alexandria home ( four-and-a-half hours after he had left his D.C. office ) , I practically smothered him with a hug as I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distraught over the news of the attacks to humor me . My husband was back in his office on September the twelfth , which was the best thing in the world for him . I , on the other hand , could not get back to my creative endeavors at all . I am a playwright who 'd been working on a new script before we went to Sicily , but the day after the attacks , I chose to stare at the birds . The bug screen was as oppressive as ever . But the chicks were bigger . I thought , " This is just my racing imagination . . . birds ca n't grow noticeably larger in twenty or so hours . " But I was n't on anything , and as I 've said , I 'm a layman . Then I thought . . . could 've sworn one of the chick 's eyes , for a moment , opened ! The mother dove was still sitting on her babes . It really seemed like she could easily crush them , but all three birds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing ( my layman term for watching birds be birds ) . The mother dove was preternaturally patient . With all of us . Then I read several newspapers and got . . . well . . . uncontrollably emotional again . So I visited the birds , who were unmoved . I watched them breathe for about an hour and a half . The mother dove cocked her head ever so slightly . Her left eye , a small bright chocolate chip , seemed to focus on my face . She may have thought I was a rainmaker from all the water streaming down my cheeks . I gave my husband the word on our birds when he came home . He called me a " cat . " Then he went to the window but it was too dark for him to see anything ( he 's a workaholic ) . Each day I 'd wake up depressed like countless other folks . But unlike my bummed-out but productive husband , I could not concentrate on work . My days consisted of world news and bird views . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective of my feathered guests . I really wanted them to get big and strong . I wanted to feed them something green or Wheatena or pet them , but I knew it would be wrong to do that . I decided to keep things completely natural , even though I was absolutely desperate . There were additional activities . The mother dove fed the chicks individually and sometimes at the exact same time . . . she 'd pour open her beak and both chicks would shove theirs into it . One day I was crying so profusely that the mother dove looked right at me and opened up her beak extremely wide . After several days of partaking in worm-fests , the babes got singing lessons . Their voices were soprano-like and light . . . lilting quills . Then they started to preen themselves . This led to the flapping of fat , fluffy wings , which led to everyone levitating a half-inch above the not-so-natty nest . The mother dove , now only twice the size of her babes , became amazingly brazen about facing me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and eighty degree head-turn ) and stare . But she was far from diabolical . She was an awesome mother . Every day she 'd leave her babes comfortably scrunched in the corner for a time . But then , like clockwork , she 'd be back with their lunch or dinner . . . I never caught breakfast . And when the chicks would flap their wings , and especially when they 'd stretch their wings , they seemed like fuzzy cherubs . Though I had n't actually seen them travel , flying lessons had probably happened . On September twentieth , I visited my little friends . They seemed geographically closer to me , yet were very much doing their thing . I had hoped to witness them " winging it " over my yard and garden . But no such luck . I rationalized that the earlier rain might have had something to do with it . The wet chicks were on the middle of the ledge , with the mother dove a few inches farther away than usual . Mother looked like a big soft tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-first , before he left for work , my hubby kissed me goodbye . He said that the dove chicks seemed bored to pieces . Then he smiled like the Cheshire cat . And I rolled over and slept . When I finally got up , I peeked outside our bedroom window , and saw how baby blue the sky was . I ran downstairs to the dining room to see my poor " bored " birds . But the ledge was empty and the nest even more so . The little boarders were gone . Perhaps for good . I was sad , but also happy . I knew in my heart the chicks ' flying was as priceless as the pilots themselves . Then I went to my home office . And then it occurred to me that for the first time , I had n't noticed the rusty bug screen . At least , it was the first time I noticed I had n't noticed it . And then I whipped my script out . p. 10 p. 11 Act 1 , Scene 8 8 . PRECIOUS PRESSURE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where I aim this . Dad , I want so desperately for you to see me famous . I want you to see folks worship me like at a mosque or Temple or a church . I want you see me win an Oscar . I want you to beam with pride and brag to friends with gusto . And I want you doing this before you bite the dust . And Yet I know deep in my heart that you do n't give a darn Whether it is solid gold I spin or it is yarn . p. 12 Act 1 , Scene 9 9 .

We all know what happened tomorrow , over half a century ago , at Pearl Harbor . But my baby brother , who 's eight years younger than me , was born on that date . And several other folks I know were born on December seventh ; different years , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tired line from their muddled , wise-guy buddies : " It 's your birthday ; let 's get bombed ! " My other brother , who 's a year younger then me , shares a birthday with Mary Shelley . And I 'm so jealous , because I missed that date by less than seven hours . But I 'm sure that bad things have happened on that day , too . It 's all about perspective . Sometimes the same event is viewed as both horrific and gripping . For instance , I share my birthday with Michael Jackson . Friends and relatives say I share it with Sir Richard Attenborough . In any event , it 's shocking . . . the weather . Not very White Christmas-like . But I love it . My husband prefers it cooler , but I 'm no fool . It 's true I wo n't get out and enjoy it ' cause I 'm in here writing . But I love knowing it 's there , you know ? I 'm celebrating my baby brother 's birthday a day early by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . a granny smith . Maybe it 's psychological , because my brother and I are related . It 's more likely that I used Thanksgiving as an excuse to abuse my physique for weeks , and I 'm feeling it . But I like the apple . It 's born sweet like grapes or raisins . What is it about apples . . . their association with doctors , teachers , Eve ? Are they really good for you ? If so , which ones ? Red ? Yellow ? Crab ? I think I 'm going to finish this because I 'm fidgety . I guess I 'm itching to get out . But I loved the granny smith . Maybe it 's the greenish sheen . Maybe I 'm a Jewish Colleen . A friend once told me that the Bible says , when the seasons get all jumbled up , like a mixed green salad , then it 's the end of the world .

Lots of ingredients go into salads even if they 're different kinds of rabbit food . Apples go into salads . Yes , they do . Apples and raisins . Like in chicken salads . I do n't eat chicken . I do n't even eat turkey . I ate everything else for weeks . But you get my drift . Speaking of which , I 'd like to do so outside . p. 30 p. 31 Act 1 , Scene 25 25 .

Plenty saved pennies and others gave gifts . Many saved money for all kinds of lifts . Emotional , spiritual and often facial , Where faces turned glacial and often just stayed still .

It is a lot like my father 's own pa 's . He looked like a Roman in one of those spas . No , I never lift up what 's inside my bras , So , why would I lift or short-shrift my gramp 's schnozz ? Oh , I 'll boost morale , but I wo n't conform . I 'll Choose what I have . And then I 'll be normal ? ! I 'll keep all my lines and my nose . . . I wo n't sell it .

See , when I told my hub about the pooch , he took it as a threat Oh , he got so bent out of shape that I thought he should see a vet . He said that dogs are slovenly and pushy and real dense : That their existence on this earth does not make any sense . I said , " We could run or play with dogs or take them to a park . " He said , " Honey , that is very cute but dogs are known to bark . " I said , " You are very prejudiced and that just is n't right . " He said , " My apology but dogs are also known to bite . " I said , " You are grasping straws . Oh , you are really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong but only who is open . So , why do n't we explore a store with other pets than feline ? " And so we did , but when he saw the cats he made a bee-line . And so I told him all about the dog right down the street : " He 's really very sweet and does a lot more than just eat . He 's really very interesting , the new dog on the block . He concentrates on other things besides a smelly sock . " Hubby said , " No matter what , a dog will fit the stereotype . " I said , " You are barking up the wrong tree with this terrier-type . He looks just like a shaggy leprechaun with blackish fur and beard And lots of twinkle in his eyes ! " My husband said , " You 're getting weird . " Then I said , " He is quiet and he 's lively . And he 's strong and gentle And I love the way he looks at me ! " My husband said , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog 's a gentleman . . . he 's like a Southerner . And gives me bones . I hate it when we leave each other . Our neighbor said , My dog is not a bother . He 's real fun . You 've no idea how much I love him . . . like a father and a son. And I , myself , have seen the pooch in so darn many sun-spots that I truly do believe that in another life he was a cat . " " That 's blasphemy and heresy ! " my husband said while quaking . " Just sleep on it . You know you 'll feel all better when you waken . " But then it really dawned on me my hub adores what is arachnid He just lets a spider be or sets it free outside . I whack it . And yet I 've never tried to change him . . . I do n't want a nebbish . He 's an architect and so , he marvels at things webbish . No , I have never ever tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done is say , " Thank God , it 's not a roach ! " But hubby still wo n't let dogs in , and says the " you 're insane " line . I think I 'll buy a dog-house and then dub my hub a " canine . " p. 41 p. 42 Act 1 , Scene 33 33 . FIT TO PRINT II NGIWA Why do you give well-known guys The upper hand with advertisements ?

But that 's only because you 're in heaven . As you 've always been on top of things , you most certainly know about the horrendous events of September eleventh . And I know you also mourn a favorite haunt . . . the restaurant at Windows on the World . I dream of you from time to time , ever since you passed away more than fourteen years ago . In my dreams , you 're usually sitting , relaxed and chatting with or around me . You 're always in a restaurant . And it 's always Windows on the World . And you 're always radiant , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost royal aura . Just like you were at the beautiful college-graduation party you threw for me at Windows on the World . And at any of the many parties you threw there for other loved ones . Try not to be sad . I just dug up a ton of photos of the party you threw me ! God , I was oddly dressed . I wore a peach silk dress , but on reflection , it was more like an uptown nightgown . My dark blond hair was done up in a Tiger Lily style from " Peter Pan . " It was swept in a thick French braid that fell over my left shoulder , and drew even more attention to the cleavage that I lacked . A thin peach ribbon stretched across my forehead like a satin cat . Bunches of baby 's breath were wedged inside the braid as if they 'd been growing there . I 've always joked that the only thing missing was a mango-colored flamingo feather . Thank you for letting me share that event with ten of my friends . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cousins , including some from my father 's side . My folks had been divorced a year , and they sat at separate tables , with everyone desperately not noticing . Thanks for inviting both of them . My ex-boyfriend is still in my life . We catch up by phone once or twice a year . It 's nice . He married a gal who 's much more right for him . I think she drags him to the golf-course . He 's madly in love with his son , who 's just a year younger than your great-granddaughter who 's your namesake . My ex-boyfriend was a great guy . He was an ideal boyfriend . . . aware and caring , classy and family-oriented . . . and a generous friend . . . like you ! You always insisted that your grandchildren date " Jewish . " You were emphatic about that . Teaching me , at the age of eight , to make pancakes out of matzo-meal , so I could impress some Jewish guy 's mother . We dumped a lot of sugar on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw me a ritzy party at Windows on the World , I was somewhat unappreciative , as I knew you 'd never let me invite everyone I wanted to . But you positively shocked me by saying that I could . Either you were being flexible or you had to get your Windows on the World fix , but I got a Church of England person , my ex-boyfriend , at my side . And everyone survived . Beautifully . Thank you , Grandma , for having mighty strong desires and not biting me with them . It meant the world because you and I were both happy . And I ended up marrying a Jew . But only because I loved him . Nevertheless , it meant the world because you and I were both happy . Obviously , if there were more folks like you , Windows on the World would still exist . I know that does n't make you feel better . But I also know you understand that you ca n't always understand things . You 're the one who died of lung cancer when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma . Now I 'm going to say goodbye , but not for long as I 'm sure I 'll dream of you soon ! And you 'll be smiling and laughing and gracious to all the waiters before I even see you ! And maybe the next letter you get will be from a great-grandchild telling you all about a marvelous party she attended or threw at Windows on the World ! p. 47 p. 48 Act 1 , Scene 38 38 . TWIN TATERS HATO I love sweet potatoes , and it 's a good thing . I love lots of other stuff , but I could n't make the same statement . Actually , my comments would be abominable . Especially since it 's December . . . that stuff-your-gut time of year . But sweet potatoes , " taters , " as my husband and I call them , are delicious as well as healthy . I ca n't believe you do n't have to camouflage them . People do , and they 're entitled to . But not me . As a matter-of-fact , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mash it . Do n't even use a fork to eat it . I just pick the tater up and gobble it like a hot-dog . Once my husband saw this . That 's all . And he still makes them for me . Every morning , before I go to sleep ( I 'm a bit of a vampire who writes at night and drops at light ) , he microwaves a tater before he heads into work . Then he sticks it in the fridge . A little ritual . The clove-like aroma wafts right on up to my side of the bed , intoxicates me and knocks me out in approximately no time . My husband is a mighty good microwaver . His taters are so good I gobble them up like a hot-dog cold . Really , I never re-heat them . I like things as natural as possible . My hub is also a smart supermarket shopper . He trusts himself to bargain-hunt and not pit-stop for " bizarre objects " like greeting cards . It 's real easy for him to pick up items as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's got each grocery store 's closing time memorized . All of this is very helpful as I tend to get lost in stores . Scanning prices is painless compared to scanning vices like questionable recipes or honeydew melons with " we're-not-telling " sell-by dates . So once in a while , hubby comes home with a rancid cantaloupe . But it sure beats my ten-minute inspections of each one . On a serious note , I had a hard time sleeping today and concentrating on a writing project last night . I could not stop thinking about the most recent " friendly fire , " where three American soldiers died and more than a few were wounded . I was n't even distracted when my hub brought home a sack of sweet potatoes in a variety of sizes . I have such a tough time with the concept " friendly " fire . I understand that it has always happened . But it 's like a good guy can die if he does or he does n't . It 's disturbing . And I know it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad news , I lose my appetite . I nuked my newest . . . latest tater in our sink 's garbage disposal ' cause I did n't want hubby to think I did n't eat it . Eat . . . I usually drink it . I guess it was my form of fasting . I lost two thousand calories , but I did n't mean to . I only drank warm spring water . Warm because I do n't refrigerate it . I like my water done room-temperature . Anyway , I 'm ravenous , but as I 've said I lost my appetite . It 's not because I do n't like cooking . Believe me , I know how to microwave , too . It 's just that maybe there are too many associations with food and fire . " Friendly fire . " Is n't that what cooking is ? Especially microwaving ? I keep thinking of our soldiers and the Afghani good guys . And then I think of all the firemen on September eleventh . And all the firemen in general . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's her , anyway . And all those suttees . You know , those funeral pyres for Hindu husbands that wives were pressured to lie upon alive . They sound like those sofas . . . " settees , " right ? I do n't think so . You can also pronounce a suttee like sut-tee , but it sounds like " slutty . " I do n't know if they still exist . God forbid . Remember Shirley Maclaine in " Around the World in Eighty Days " ? She was the Indian princess that David Niven saved ? But she 's Shirley Maclaine . I love her . She 's my vicarious thrill for a mother . And I love her hair . The color of fire . Which is probably why they did n't burn her in the movie . . . it would have been redundant . I 'm starving , but my heart 's not up to a pseudo barbecue . It 's 8:34 in the morning , and I 'm tossing and turning like I 'm at Ross Dress for Less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tater , and imagining it on a paper plate or a Frisbee . What an image . Frisbee . It 's got the word " fire " in it . If you scramble it up , it becomes " Fires be . " I think I 'll give a donation to the Alexandria Fire Department . It 's December and we always spend on charities . Just never on a firemen 's association . That 's what I 'll do . That 's exactly what I 'll do . And I 'll eat my lunch three hours early . ' Cause I just raided the fridge , and I 've discovered not one , but two sweet-potatoes . Hubby 's never made me two together , but these are tiny and the same basic shape . Twin taters . Not at all the size of a hot-dog . But promising enough to chomp ! p. 49 p. 50 Act 1 , Scene 39 39 . OK U.K. ! or OWN ME , TONY !

STAR/STRIPE STORY NGIWA Several weeks after September eleventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress in order to copyright a play I 'd written . Now I 've always enjoyed going from my home in Alexandria , Virginia to the District in order to hand-deliver my works . It 's a quick trip , as the Capitol South metro is just one block from the copyright office . I know it 's a little thing , but it feels like a real accomplishment to me . And instead of waiting weeks for a receipt , I get to take home the proof of my registration that same exact day ! Unfortunately this time , I found myself using all sorts of excuses to avoid going to a major government institution . It did n't matter that I knew the Library of Congress was safer than most places , as it had security people as well as a machine . . . a metal detector , I believe , at the entrance . It did n't matter I 'd copyrighted many , many works over the past decade and a half , thereby seeing the machine and the many , many security folk . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could eradicate the experience . Still , I would not go . And I was afraid to attend the classic play , To Kill a Mockingbird , at Ford 's Theatre , as the handsome , antique theater was , of course , another D.C. landmark . My husband had already bought a pair of tickets , and we had both looked very much forward to the gig . But I started to wimp out hardcore . My husband did n't know what to do . But I tactfully distracted myself by searching for a very traditional American flag to display on the front of our house . I really did want a flag and one large enough to make a statement . While I admit that I 'd never thought about a flag before , neighbors ' flags were basically in my face , and these are shamelessly sensible folks , so I had to redeem myself . Unfortunately , no flags could be found . Not proper ones , but perhaps I was elongating the process . What I did find were small flags on sticks that you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patriotic stickers to help shroud my little basement window . But other than that , there was nothing up to snuff . I did n't want to use the Internet or a catalogue because I wanted to see prospective items live . . . up close and personal . We 'd been disappointed in the past by products that were not at all what we had shopped for . Other things in my life did not seem to be working . It got to the point where I would n't take public transportation into the District . My home in Alexandria is just twenty minutes outside of D.C. , so a bus or metro is the perfect mode of travel . But then it got to the point where I would n't take a taxicab either . Who knows who would be assigned to this here passenger ? If he was like that terrorist guy in Boston , I did n't want to give the slime a dime . I was so frustrated that I finally sent my play to the Library of Congress via my local post-office . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certified notice saying the Register of Copyrights had indeed received it . But then anthrax came along and I started to ruminate what I would be doing the next time around . I could n't imagine going to any post-office again . So I thought of using couriers in the future . But then I thought that that was crazy . . . it 's not like I 'd have a deadline or like my only manuscript in the world would be delivered or like the work would be CIA sensitive . Then I thought of letting my husband take care of it all from his office . But then I thought , " It 's not his problem or responsibility . " And then I started to resent that I could n't just waltz into the Library of Congress as I always had . And then I felt squelched . Positively squashed . Locked up . Boxed in . I thought I would n't write anything new , and that way I could avoid the Library of Congress altogether . But you know how you tell a kid he ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? Well , I felt like I was doing that to myself , and I rebelled . I started to write this precise collection of poems and moments . And I did it in time for the theater . I actually thought of our tickets to Mockingbird as an escape . . . which theater is when you come to think of it . And as I would be going with my husband , I felt protected , as opposed to going solo . Mockingbird was not without problems , but at least they were n't the slimy kind . When we took our seats , I felt relief . The show was enjoyable overall , and we were very pleased we were seeing it . When we left the Ford 's Theatre , we stopped at a souvenir shop on the corner of the same street . Perhaps I felt like a tourist who had braved traveling that day , or maybe I wanted a memento for myself of having actively tackled something . I should have gotten a bookmark or magnet at the theater , but by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores of patrons . . . maybe there still was the uneasiness of being inside such a famous place . In any event , I ventured into the little commercial store , urgently searching for nothing in particular , as my husband was already fretting as well as sweating . Fiercely determined to purchase some type of merchandise , I scanned the candy , tee-shirts and other stuff . And then I saw it . My flag ! Well , not exactly . But lacking only in the flag department . It was a red , white and blue , star-spangled banner . . . only a large , marvelously silky , scarf one ! I could wear it if I was ever inclined to , but I could also flaunt it in the front of our home ! I do n't think I even attempted to find a standard flag . I just grabbed the star/striped scarf and ran to the cash register . Strangely enough , the scarf fit perfectly ; it covered every inch of the window it was placed in ! And I can safely say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will walk in to the Library of Congress and then to the Copyright office , in order to register Flying Lessons . Since I know the Library has security , more than is found in most places , I 'll gladly take my chances while I 'm no longer grounded ! p. 61 p. 62 Act 2 , Scene 5 49 .

KATIE 'S CRAYON , WILL 'S WALL AND GRACIE 'S ERASER PALOMA Katie , Will and Gracie are siblings and my kid sister 's kids . I love my nieces and nephew to pieces . But for the first time ever , I did not look forward to my visit with them . My trip to their dwelling , several states away , was scheduled for December eleventh . But as it approached , I felt more and more apprehensive about the event . Perhaps the apprehension had to do with the hassle of travel . But it had n't rattled me that much in the past . Perhaps it was because December eleventh reminds me of September eleventh . You know . . . they sound alike . But it 's a day I 've always loved , as it 's the day I met my husband . But maybe that 's just it . Maybe I did n't want to be away from my hub on the anniversary of the day we met . Although it 's not our wedding anniversary , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blessing . December eleventh was also the second day of Hanukkah , and if I went , I would end up missing six more days of Hanukkah with my hub . I 'll go with the Anniversary Theory . Because I remember attempting in early December to create a patriotic greeting card  --  it was a commissioned work ! And all I kept making were paintings of red , white and blue hearts . And my only deviation was a sketch of a cherub with very red cheeks , very blue eyes and very hefty flesh that was terribly pale . But I did n't want to disappoint my nieces and nephew , as they are even younger than my husband . So I took the train . And was so knocked out from my ruminating the night before about all the things that could go wrong on my travels that I fell asleep the entire ride . The actual visit with the kids was a trip in itself . We did a lot of art projects designated by " mommy . " My sister took serious advantage of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so , Katie , Gracie , Will and I sketched , colored and copied a lot of dogs , horses , barns and Barney . Katie , the eldest , loves the color blue . . . perhaps as a boycott of cottoncandy colors . Every shade is her favorite , especially " Spice Girl " blue which also means " royal . " So , not only does Katie wear blue constantly , she uses it in her art . All her magic markers are blue . And all her crayons are variations on the theme . If you were to stand them up smack in a row , they 'd look like a fullfigured menorah . Speaking of which , it was Hanukkah , as I mentioned , so , all the candles , including the " shammash " or leader , were blue because Katie was the " shammash " of the family . Never mind that she picked through the box of multicolored candles each day and ignored all the green , yellow , pink , red , et-cetera colors Gracie preferred . Will could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to the day he could light them . Will , as well as Katie and two-year-old Gracie , waited with bated breath for the first day of snow to make its way to their home . Each evening the kids would veer into the garage and stare at the big red sled as if at any moment it would stand up and do a snow dance . And each day we kept busy with art projects , action figures , Spice Girl cassettes , privacy time and introspections on " Shrek . " We also did shadowpuppet plays on Will 's bedroom wall . We did " Shrek " as best we could , with several repeat performances ( or glorified rehearsals ) . One afternoon Gracie decided to use a blue crayon to paint a shadowpuppet on Will 's wall . At the time , Katie and I were busy singling out the blue menorah candles in the kitchen . Gracie was with Will in his room , but while he used the bathroom , she did some serious interior decorating . And then she chose to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink to a permanent periwinkle . Thankfully , the damage to Will 's wall was minimal , but my sister was insistent that from then on , all art projects were to be done under my complete supervision . I had no more privacy , let alone time to re-visit my commissioned work . But I really was happy to have so much time with the kids . On the last night of my visit , Katie was too busy to hunt for just-right candles . She kept crayoning stuff at her work station . So I was delegated the task as I watched weather reports on the little kitchen television . Still no snow . But when I turned the TV off , I realized that all the candles I had put in the menorah at random were either red , white or blue . An absolute flag of wax ! After mommy 's dinner was finished , we were once more assigned to the artistic grindstone . But all the kids were too distracted to snap into it . They wanted snow . And they wanted it before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menorahs . Katie wanted candles that would n't melt quickly . Will wanted to light them with snow fire . And Gracie was probably sick of blue . Soon the kids grew quite moody , so , I suggested we create our own snow . While it got their attention , it was a hellish sell . Snow in the form of an empty sketch-pad was not exactly free from kvetches . But I tried to explain that the real beauty of art is that you do n't have to wait for things to happen . On a single piece of paper , you can create your own snow and paint it blue ; light your candles with watercolors ; or sketch , erase or paint over your snow before it falls outside . They sort of liked that . At least , they went with it . And so , pages of white paper became snow . The kids painted everything else . Menorahs rode on red sleds . Snowmen were built by Shrek and friends . And a very bundled mommy painted portraits of action figures . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole way back on the train .

GARDEN STARS NGIWA Once upon a time , there was a garden filled with emerald green flowers . These flowers were very proud and stood tall in their places . They relished being the " stars " of the garden . Actually , they were the only foliage in it , but they still enjoyed being celebrities . They even felt they were better than all the neighbors ' emerald green flowers . HATO One day , a bunch of purple flowers were planted in the garden alongside the emerald green ones . Naturally , the green flowers were upset and though it was really subtle , they became greener . And they were so busy being upset they never made the connection that the purple flowers were filled with just as much blue as themselves . YONAH At first , the green flowers tried to stand taller . That way , they figured , they could block the purple ones from getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion , several of the green ones accidentally snapped their own stems . So the others decided to can the plan . NGIWA Next the green flowers started drinking the purple flowers ' share of water , as they figured the new flowers would dry up after a time . But several of the green ones drowned from all of the drink . So the others decided to can that plan as well . p. 86 HATO Soon the green flowers decided to abstain from water so , they figured , the gardeners would water them extra hard , and then the residue would land on the purple flowers and drown them . But by then , the new flowers caught on to how unneighborly the green ones were . So when the residue arrived , the new ones did not drink it . They were not greedy anyway . YONAH Unfortunately for the green flowers , the gardeners were away on vacation , so for three whole days no water whatsoever arrived . And since the green ones had abstained from water three days before that , at least half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others were quite dehydrated . Soon it rained and the dehydrated ones were so thirsty that they drank too much and of course , drowned . NGIWA The remaining green flowers were positively livid that the purple flowers were now the main attraction of the garden . So the green ones decided to do something drastic . They planned to firmly plant themselves on top of the purple ones , thereby blocking them from both sun and water . HATO But the green ones who wanted so badly to zap the new ones only uprooted themselves and landed out of the soil , face down . The effect was that of being buried on top of a grave . YONAH When the gardeners returned and saw the green flowers in such mangy condition and strange position , they did not bother to salvage any . They threw them straight away and chose not to replace them with any healthy green ones . Instead , the gardeners planted many more purple flowers which brightened up the garden for a very long time ! p. 87 p. 88 Act 2 , Scene 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need rocket science or a membership in Mensa Or a super memory .

It longed to look like its friends and neighbors . It even envied its enemies . The face was awfully distraught that it did not look the way it wanted to . Basically , it became devastated . And though the face was supposed to look the way it did , it chose not to " face the facts . " So much so that it became confused and chose not to fax the face . The face had a beloved cousin who was a patient in a local hospital . The cousin had a very terrible disease which was making him waste away , and all sorts of therapy were used to try to improve him . For a while , the face visited its cousin often . But soon the face got distracted by itself , which is how the story started . The face had a splendid profession raising money for worthy charities . These included victims of terrorist acts and work-related accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the flattering job became a fad , and the face became a face figuratively as well as literally . Extremely bored , the face became even more distracted by itself , so it went to a doctor at the same hospital its cousin was a patient in . For weeks , the face saw a bunch of doctors to discuss its options for improving its appearance . And always . . . actually like clockwork , the face forgot to pop in on its cousin . As a matter of fact , when the cousin heard the face was in the hospital , he dragged himself out of bed and tried to see the face , but died along the way . ' Til the end of its days , the face did not know if its cousin was alive or dead . But back to the story . After about a month-and-a-half of consultations , the face decided to take the plunge . It had cosmetic injections done all over itself . And when it went home , it was smiling ear to ear . But no one noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , friends and neighbors started to misinterpret the face . It was particularly dangerous when enemies did the same . Soon the face felt weak . This sorely disoriented it . The face felt it should be stronger from the confidence it got by having improved itself . But it felt so weak , it checked itself into the same place where it had changed its face . At the hospital , it followed that the face was weak with the same disease its cousin had had . We all know things can be hereditary . Anyway , to make a long story surgically enhanced , since the face was just a face , its features are what wasted away . To this day , no one knows how the face ever felt about that . p. 90 p. 91 Act 2 , Scene 29 74 . FURTHER FEATHERS ( or Flying Lessons II ) HATO Yesterday two terrorists blew themselves up in Israel , right outside a convenience store called the " Sunflower Seed Center . " The only thing natural about the act was that it maimed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps Chairman Arafat or Saddam Hussein ran out of money , so terrorists have to share a " farewell " video . Maybe money has nothing to do with it . Maybe all those terrorists are happy with bit-parts . A lot of folks think bit-parts are for the birds . But birds should not be pooh-poohed . After all , they tend to ascend . Speaking of birds , we had a new mourning-dove chick on the ledge above our back door ! He shared a substantial nest with an unhatched egg . His mother had " rented " the space from another bird who built it about a year ago . Before the dove chick was born , his mother had perched herself on the nest for several weeks . To the point , frankly , of my being concerned . I never saw her move . No matter what time of day I observed her , she was in the same antisocial pose . Her back faced me , and her face " kissed " a corner . I fretted that the mother dove was n't eating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench under the ledge . Then I raised myself up in order to see if the mother was actually breathing . And , thankfully , she was . Rapidly , as a matter of fact . Determined not to scare the feathers off the bird , I put the bench away . I do n't know about her , but I felt better . I certainly dropped my notion of feeding her " dead " bread . Then one day the nest was empty . At least , the mother dove was gone . I hopped back up on the bench and discovered a scruffy dove chick sleeping near his unhatched sibling . Within a week he was a fat , fluffy dove chick who was now scrunched up against the little brittle egg . More than ever , I wanted the dove chick to be healthy , but I never saw him eat . I never saw his mom feed him . She was nowhere in sight . I fretted about this out loud to my husband . The dove chick clearly seemed ready for flying lessons , yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was my vicarious thrill for a pet as my husband was allergic to my favorite domestic animal . . . cats . My philosophy flexed in seconds : if you ca n't be with the one you love , love its food . Speaking of food , the dove chick seemed to be abandoned by his mother . So I thought of feeding him myself . It did n't matter he was getting fatter . He still did not convince me he was eating . The dove chick also did some interesting stuff . He would walk inside his nest , clockwise once or twice , then plop right back down . Maybe it was an avian rain dance . Maybe he thought manna crumbs would come . Which got me thinking and then fretting louder to my husband . " The dove chick is not eating . . . I know it . Perhaps I should go to Trader Joe 's and pick up some dry roasted , unsalted hell-with-the-shell pistachio nuts . They 're really healthy and fattening ! " After a lengthy debate , we compromised on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballgame on the Internet , and I felt better . Positively bird-maternal and determined . I would set out for sunflower seeds the very next day , which was the Fourth of July . But when July Fourth appeared , I fantasized that the dove chick would gain his independence smack on it ! I really relish motifs . I also deduced that " spoon feeding " the dove chick a bunch of sunflower seeds would not exactly help him " grow . " I held off on Trader Joe 's and secretly willed the dove chick to fly off before he turned into a pumpkin seed . I even tried to manipulate things . I talked baby-talk to the dove chick while I watered my little garden . . . overtime . I figured the chick would think I was a rainmaker ; that I was creating fresh , unprocessed seeds right before his eyes . This could then motivate him to leave the nest and peruse my black-eyed susans , which look a lot like sunflowers to my somewhat confused hub . Unfortunately , the only " happening " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with wings , but not the feathered kind . A terrorist attacked , maimed and killed several people at an El Al counter in Los Angeles International Airport . More ironically , the terrorist celebrated his forty-first birthday that way . Alert security guards promptly responded . They fought the terrorist and blew him away . Thank God , he never " flew " away . Needing to feel protective of something , I observed my bird . Selfishly , I was glad he was still in the nest . I admit he looked very well . His feathers were a pleasant heather grey and quite hefty . As I stood up on the bench , the dove chick started flapping his wings . I do n't know , with regard to me , if he was clapping or slapping , but I was still concerned he was n't ingesting anything . I had n't seen his mom for what seemed to be ever . Tons of sunflower seeds danced in my head . Desperate , I pointed out a lone ant that was outside on the window pane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he declined . Then he stood up as tall as he could and spread both of his wings as if he were a kitten warding off a grizzly bear . Humbled , I put the bench away and kvetched to hub , who was again listening to an Internet ballgame . Uninterested in my riff , he suggested I root for birds called the Baltimore Orioles . They were sorely losing . I went outside and did the unthinkable . I baby-talked to the dove chick without water . I did so for over an hour . And then hub whisked me away to the movies . We saw " Late Marriage , " a film about Israelis . When we arrived home , it was after midnight and no longer the Fourth of July . The dove chick was still resting in the nest . My rainmaking and baby-talk did not make a dent . Exhausted as well as upset that the chick had ruined my independence theme/scheme , I went to bed . Several hours later I woke up , tossed and turned . . . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe it was the movie . A real good one . But it did not have an " independence " ending as the protagonist married who he did not love . Maybe it was my downright obsession with sunflower seeds . I stayed awake another hour and then finally crept out of bed . It was daylight . . . about five A.M. I quietly made my way downstairs in order to bird-watch , though counting one chick and an unhatched egg is not exactly sheep-replacement therapy . But I was shocked to see the mother dove perched on the ledge ! The dove chick was out of the nest and hungrily under his mom 's beak . Then mother dove poured open her beautiful beak , and the chick 's beak dove right in . I was thrilled to witness this . Just because I had n't seen the mother , it did n't mean she was n't there ! I went back to bed and slept a few more hours . Soundly . On July fifth , at about nine A.M. , I tried to bird-watch but found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside to water my little garden but realized it did not need any help . It was certainly not thirsty due to my July Fourth water work . Even the black-eyed susans appeared to be smiling . Later that day I paid a visit to Trader Joe 's . I came home with a big bottle of spring water and a bigger bag of dry-roasted sunflower seeds . And I ingested them as I wistfully visited the empty nest . Just three weeks later the nest was filled up by a brand new family . Unhatched eggs were a thing of the past as twin dove chicks were nourished and flourishing . They even completed their flying lessons the same day the conjoined twins in California were operated on . Who could have planned that ? Several weeks after their departure , the chicks still visit my little garden . And even though they do n't have to , they stick together . Of course , I get the urge to feed them sunflower seeds , but it remains in my brain . The chicks tend to gravitate towards my rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 92 p. 93 Act 2 , Scene 30 75 . GREENER GRASS COLOMBA I 'm telling you an anecdote , a simple little rhyme ; I hope that it will interest you or help you pass the time . Although I 've never told my husband , I 'll tell you with candor , At times I think : " I could have married Jason Alexander . " Now please do understand that we had never even dated And so , of course my private thought is sorely overrated . Oh , Jason was the first guy that I liked , and that 's my claim . Before he ever made his mark , " Jay Greenspan " was his name . We met while in a musical called Once Upon a Mattress , And at rehearsals , Jason , he 'd sit next to this here actress ; In fact , no matter whether Jay was tired or immersed , He 'd always save a seat for me if he arrived there first . We lived in different towns and so he was n't at my school , Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was half as cool ( And twice a week , like clockwork , I would smile ; he would drool ) But we were little  --  I was fourteen , Jay was one year younger  --  So , there was no way we could really satisfy our hunger . And so we parted when the show was over . Rest is history , But I still wonder if Jay Greenspan Alexander missed me , And though the contact we had had was really very minimal , I think of Jason frequently and even while subliminal . I often dream of marrying that Seinfeld guy in style And wait with bated breath as Jason never walks the aisle ; I even dream of being at an orgy hot and bare , Yet nothing ever touches me ' cept George Costanza 's chair . But when I wake , if someone bothers me with blah blah blah , I think : " I could have married Jason Alexander . Hah ! " And if a guy does something that just causes me to gripe , I think : " Oh , loser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I wish for something that I have n't got , I think of Mr. Alexander . . . middle name is " Scott " . . . I think : " I could have married him . . . oh , I 'd be on the map ! " But then I think : " Well , what 's he like when he hears It 's a wrap ! ? " And so I 'll wrap up all this stuff and end my little poem ' Cause Jason may be very nice , but face it , I do n't know ' im . See , I prefer a man that I can love and really feel  --  Reminiscing never kissing loses its appeal . And reminiscing what is missing , I just let it pass ; At times it may be greener , but let 's face it , grass is grass .
