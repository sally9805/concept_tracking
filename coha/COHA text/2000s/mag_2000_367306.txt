EBay claimed the seller , Sacramento lawyer Kenneth A. Walton , placed bids on the painting himself . <P> Why bother with the Internet ? If you want to make money on garage-sale paintings , look for the magnolias . Four paintings by 19th century realist Martin Johnson Heade have been purchased at garage sales and an estate sale for next to nothing in the past few years . Three fetched mammoth prices at Christie 's ; the fourth is on its way . Magnolias on a Wooden Table , bought by a Racine , Wis. , resident for $5 , will fetch $200,000 to $300,000 , Christie 's estimates , at auction on May 25 . Two Magnolias on Blue Plush , which cost a Wausau , Wis. , man $29 , sold at Christie 's last May for $882,500 . And Magnolia Blossoms on Blue Velvet and Cherokee Roses were purchased together in Tucson , Ariz. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 1996 for $937,500 and $134,500.
