Waving a Cohiba cigar in his expansive office overlooking downtown Montgomery , Ala. , David Bronner talks enthusiastically about his investments : in an airline just reorganized after bankruptcy , a chain of luxury golf resorts and a group of television stations . Is he a gunslinging Sunbelt entrepreneur in the mold of Ted Turner ? A hedge-fund manager ? A contrarian private-equity investor ? Not even close . Bronner , 58 , is , in his own words , " a government bureaucrat "  --  the chief executive of Retirement Systems of Alabama ( RSA ) , the pension fund for 290,000 state workers and retirees . An unabashed cheerleader for Alabama who is comfortable in the spotlight , Bronner is overturning the image of the pension manager as passive investor  --  and not without controversy . <P> Bronner turned heads last fall when RSA spent $240 million for a 37% stake in the nation 's seventh largest passenger carrier , US Airways , which this month emerged from Chapter 11 protection and named Bronner as its new chairman . Some of his ideas for reviving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 billion in media holdings and its string of acclaimed Alabama golf courses , the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail . " I 'll give US Airways free advertising , " Bronner says . The pitch : " Fly US Airways to the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail ! " <P> Such big bets on synergy are n't the typical way to provide for the golden years of assistant principals and highway patrol officers . Most state pension funds are staid , blue-chip investors that focus on earning steady returns . But since taking over RSA in the early 1970s , when it was worth $500 million , Bronner , a finance Ph.D. , has overseen its growth into a $22.4 billion concern . Under Bronner , RSA has ventured boldly into direct investments intended not only to fund state workers ' pensions but also to boost Alabama 's lagging economy and image . " I do n't want to be a pension-fund manager who does n't given a s about the state he lives in , " Bronner says with characteristic bluntness . <P> But the US Airways acquisition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through bankruptcy reorganization , has pension-fund experts wondering about the risks of Bronner 's approach . The deal makes RSA the carrier 's largest equity investor ( RSA already held $340 million in US Airways debt and owned nine of the airline 's jets . ) RSA 's stake should create jobs in Alabama , where the carrier is expected to build new regional facilities . But whether that sort of spending will benefit the airline and its shareholders  --  including RSA  --  is another question . <P> To gain effective control of US Airways , RSA outbid by 20% the Texas Pacific Group , based in Fort Worth , a private-equity outfit with long experience investing in distressed airlines . RSA has plunged into a battered industry that has bedeviled even value-stock gurus like Warren Buffett , who once described his airline investments as " temporary insanity . " Olivia Mitchell , executive director of the Pension Research Council at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School of Business , warns that for a pension fund , direct investment in such a risky business  --  especially when the fund manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conflict of interest . Running a pension fund and running an airline are two different skill sets . "
