Leon and the Spitting Image Chapter One The Envelope The night before the start of fourth grade , Leon Zeisel was on pins and needles . He lay in bed thinking about just one thing . An envelope . Leon had first discovered the envelope one week earlier , while poking through his mom 's desk . The envelope had attracted his attention for a simple reason . His name was written across the front in thick block letters . For a brief moment he had thought the envelope might contain a special surprise  --  tickets to a YankeesRed Sox doubleheader would have been sweet  --  but that dream disappeared as soon as he noticed the school seal and a single word stamped in blood-red ink : CONFIDENTIAL That warning did the trick . Curious though he was , Leon shoved the unopened envelope back inside the desk . But after a few days , curiosity turned into concern , and concern then turned into terror . Which was why , the night before school started , Leon slipped out of bed and made a beeline back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle drawer halfway out . That released a catch on the slim side drawer . Do n't rush , he told himself . Mom 's working late . Leon squinched his eyes shut and clucked his tongue . Only after completing his good-luck routine did he remove the envelope , undo its clasp , lift the flap , and inspect the contents  --  three sheets of paper , each with the phrase home report centered at the top . His fingers started shaking and his heart started thumping as it dawned on him that he was holding a top-secret history of his life at the Classical School . Leon took a deep breath and began to read . Page one came from his first-grade teacher , Mrs. Sloat . She wrote : " Given the tragic loss of his father , it is not surprising that Leon is a tad delayed in the domain of manual dexterity . " Leon sighed . He did n't like being called delayed . And bringing in his dad  --  who had died in a freak accident at a fireworks factory when Leon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Mrs. Sloat 's assessment : " Leon 's frustration most regularly expresses itself during craft time . He completed his macaroni necklace only with a great deal of assistance . And although a macaroni necklace might not seem important , it is . For here at the Classical School , our motto has always been , Nimble fingers make for nimble minds . ' " Geez ! How many times had he heard that stupid saying ! Leon recalled only one thing about Mrs. Sloat , and the memory was n't pleasant . He remembered her badgering him to stick his hands in Play-Doh and to feel the squishiness . Leon had n't liked squishiness back in first grade , and he did n't like squishiness now . He turned to page two . It came from his second-grade teacher , Miss Toothacre . Her report was just as grim . Miss Toothacre wrote , " Leon continues to be hampered by a troubling lack of fine motor skills . " That was another dumb thing he had heard a thousand times . Leon knew only too well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with fancy cars . Teachers used the expression to avoid calling him a klutz . The comment hurt . Suppose he was hampered ; was n't that Miss Toothacre 's fault ? She was the one cramming him into a bogus confidential report . Did n't that make her the hamperer ? Leon wiped his nose on the sleeve of his pajamas and braced himself for the third-grade report . It was now Mr. Joost 's turn to get his licks in . Mr. Joost wrote , " Leon 's handwriting is significantly below grade level , and he is challenged by even the most basic manual tasks , such as tying his laces . At this juncture , I would seriously encourage corrective measures . One suggestion : Flute lessons might improve his finger movement . " Leon had always wondered why his mother forced him to take music classes with Miss Brunelleschi . Now he knew . The home reports felt like strikes one , two , and three . And that made it all the more odd that the only nice words in the whole secret history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught PE . Coach Kasperitis wrote , " Leon is a real treat and a very special kid . His coordination needs work , but there 's no question he 's a champ . And if he ever learns to master his passion , I 'll tell you this , Leon Zeisel is the kind of kid who could make magic . "
