<p> WELCOME Home . <p> That 's what it says on the Olympic banners that have magically appeared on lampposts all over this renovated city . <p> Homecoming Day is five days away in the land where the Olympic Games began , more than 2,000 years ago . <p> " We love our history , " said Konstantinos Koletsis , the maitre d'hotel of the Omonia Times restaurant . <p> Greeks love their history because there is so much of it  --  and because it is so vivid . Take a walk around this city , and suddenly you are on Achilles Street or Socrates Street or the street named after Pindar , who wrote about the early Games , before Caesar , before Napoleon , before Juan Antonio Samaranch . <p> In the narrow streets of the Plaka or Monastiraki , at the foot of the Acropolis , you feel these ancients strolling past you . <p> The Olympic Games are part of Greek history . Now Greeks have asserted their right to hold them once again , for the first time since 1896 . <p> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , including a blunt and public rejection for the centennial Games . Once chosen for 2004 , Athens has labored mightily , at great ( and , some would say , horrible ) expense , to stage these Games  --  and their valiant effort is starting to show . There are trees and grass where a year ago there was rubble . There are stadiums and arenas where a year ago there were holes in the ground . <p> Will there be enough security and electricity and transportation for whatever tourists show up ? It is too soon to tell . But the Greeks have strained to get this far , because their honor and heritage are on international trial . <p> More than almost any people on earth , Greeks seem to take pride in events that happened more than two millenniums ago , but there is also a sense of sadness . <p> " We are not the same as our ancestors , " said Christine Kolliniati , who worships in an Orthodox church in Monastiraki . <p> She looks up toward the fabled Acropolis and talks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ships coming into Piraeus could see the gold of the statue . But now we have nothing . " <p> She is upset that the British Museum still holds the treasures known as the Elgin Marbles . <p> The ancient heritage drives these Games . The sense of loss raises hope for Greek infrastructure to catch up with Western Europe 's , hope of asserting what Greek pride used to be . <p> " We have ancient stadiums at Delphi and Olympic , and now we are going to the age of Calatrava , " said Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki , the president of the Olympic organizing committee , referring to the Spanish architect 's elaborate soaring roof over the main stadium . <p> The roof has come to be a symbol , an expensive gesture , a self-induced necessity for the success of these very Greek Games . <p> Greeks are great hosts . A visitor can not help but be touched by people 's willingness to speak English , by the sheer perfection of chicken souvlaki and baked sardines in a taverna , by the smiles and jokes from strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just as an athlete could win or lose a wrestling match in Olympia 2,500 years ago , so this modern nation can either gain or lose from this extravagant effort . <p> " We are the small guy , " said Alexander Kitroeff , a professor at Haverford College in Pennsylvania , who will return to Greece to observe these Games . " Historically , we have been kicked around . This is our moment . " <p> Kitroeff said the long domination by Turkey and the occupation during World War II produced a " Greek self-defense mechanism . " He added that a good set of Games would make Greeks feel more connected to the richer nations of Europe . <p> The legacy of games all over the Greek world , hundreds of years before Christ , touched a nerve in Europeans of the 19th century . In Athens in 1896 , Baron Pierre de Coubertin helped organize the first modern Games , based in horseshoe-shaped Panathinaiko Stadium . <p> Coubertin was so dedicated to the Olympic spirit that his heart is now buried in Olympia , the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympic tradition in the face of the International Olympic Committee in 1990 when it was time to choose the site of the centennial Games . <p> " The Greek invocation of history and tradition miscarried , " Kitroeff writes in his recent book , " Wrestling With the Ancients : Modern Greek Identity and the Olympics , " published by greekworks.com of New York . The 1996 Games went to Atlanta , but in 1997 , Athens was awarded the 2004 Games , partly in tribute to the Greek place in history . <p> The country promptly went into a three-year coma , from 1997 to 2000 , that ended only when Angelopoulous-Daskalaki , a wealthy lawyer who had helped win the bid , was brought back from limbo . <p> The 2004 Summer Games are a work in progress , far behind other hosts in the days before their Games . The city is marked by piles of construction debris , fresh tar hastily splattered on new roadways , scraggly bushes just plopped in the hard earth , raw buildings , wet paint , dangling wires , sidewalks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly grit on cars parked on the street . <p> But the new transit lines are moving fitfully , seats are being tightened into place and thousands of workers in colorful Olympic uniforms are commuting to their new tasks , which they will perform for only a few weeks . <p> Chrysanthi Kioussi , a computer expert with three degrees , is working at the credential center at the airport . After the Summer Games ( and the subsequent Paralympics ) are over , she will seek a long-term job . Asked if she related to Greek heroes , she said , " Yes , from 50 years ago , when we started to have democracy . " <p> Other Greeks look back further . Taking his family on a ride on the balky new tramline to Glyfada the other night was George Tassopoulos , a dentist , who says he reads the historian Thucydides for pleasure . <p> Greek gods are so real and Greek heroes are so legendary that it is hard to know where mythology lets up and history begins . Angelopoulos-Daskalaki often refers to the siege of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her sister grew up playing at being the Oracle of Delphi . <p> History is even in the eccentric napkin rings created by Koletsis , the manager of the Omonia Times restaurant , whose name is homage to the newspapers that used to be printed near Omonia Square . He has folded supple rectangles of plastic copier sheets , with sections from a glossary of Olympic terms printed on them . <p> " They are from Rigas Fereos , a hero of ours from the 19th century , " he said the other day . " He died in Vienna , and we remember him . " <p> The ultimate history of these 2004 Summer Games is held hostage by multiple captors  --  I.O.C. demands , network guidelines , unrealistic expectations of tourism , technology complexities , upgraded security , political realities , mushrooming needs of athletes and the news media , brutal August weather , potential terrorism and rising costs . <p> Some critics say the Games should never have been held in a nation of 11 million , the smallest to hold a Summer Games since Finland in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hoped , and the concern over terrorism has ratcheted up security costs far beyond what was imaginable before 2001 . <p> " Anyway , we would still pay these taxes , " said Ilias Cohen of Volos , who is working at the new Kol Tuv kosher restaurant in Monastiraki during the Games . " This way , at least we have something for them . " <p> Some Greeks feel the Games could be ruinous . Other Greeks feel the Games are their birthright . <p> " They should be here every four years , " said Ilias Thomloudis , now of Bridgeport , Pa. , who was standing in the ticket line outside the still beautiful Panathinaiko Stadium last week . <p> " That way we could always have good construction , " he said . <p> Actually , this sense of entitlement is a recurrent theme , from past prime ministers to the gyro seller on the corner . Professor Kitroeff from Haverford suggested that if these Games go well , some citizens will be sure to claim the Games in perpetuity , at the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : http : //www.nytimes.com The main Olympic stadium is part of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex , which was redesigned by Santiago Calatrava , the Spanish architect and engineer .
