Your carefully laid plans for early and comfortable retirement are dashed , your stock portfolio decimated . What do you do now ? <p> If your 401(k) has turned into a 201(k) and retirement is not that far off , you may be in a state of mild panic , you and several million other Americans who were deluded by a 17-year bull market into thinking that saving for retirement would be easy and painless . Some $5 trillion in stock market wealth has vanished since early last year . That long-awaited life of luxury that hovered before you is receding below the horizon . While you might not be eating cat food in your old age , the nice second home and the ambitious travel itinerary might not be doable . As the bear market drags on and on , prospects appear bleak that you can ever reassemble that shattered nest egg . <p> Well , maybe not . There are things that 50-ish and even 60-ish folks can do to salvage their futures . Some of these steps are n't easy to take . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting chance . Younger people can benefit from this advice , too ; it 's a good idea to ponder now how a market crash , say , two decades from now would change your retirement plans . Can you cope with unpleasant surprises ? <p> For all ages , the classic wisdom applies : Invest early and as much as possible . The earliest-saved dollars have the most time to compound and can stand the most year-to-year uncertainty along the way . Assuming market growth follows historical patterns , your money should compound nicely over the years ( see chart , p.106 ) . That 's not a certainty : The U.S. may end up like Japan or worse . But you ca n't eliminate uncertainty . <p> What to invest in ? As the nation wallows in a recession , the choices do n't appear too appetizing . The price/earnings ratio for the S &P; 500 stands at 28 , nearly double its historic norm . A downward drift in that ratio over the next decade to the long-run average would entirely offset a doubling of corporate earnings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago . A medium-term Treasury ( due in 2011 ) pays 4.5% , only one point more than today 's inflation rate . <p> The need to do something  --  anything  --  to recoup is strong among middle-aged investors whose portfolios are severely damaged . Take Robert and Nancy Byrd , a Fishers , Ind . couple who followed the 1990s dogma of tech and more tech . <p> As the bull market took off in the late 1990s , geometry teacher Robert , now 52 , and health care market researcher Nancy , 47 , shifted from value-oriented mutual funds to aggressive growth funds such as Janus Enterprise . Sometimes they watched the Janus fund tack on 3.5% in a single session . By early last year Robert had in excess of $500,000 in his account , more than the Byrds figured they 'd need to support Robert 's dream of retiring at 55 and buying a Virginia home close to his favorite fishing spot . Too bad for them . Since 2000 , 40% of their retirement stash has vanished . <p> " I feel like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Robert . Floundering for some way out , he has opted for the rather dubious solution of doubling his bets with even more speculative tech funds . They include ProFunds Ultra OTC and Ultra Small Cap , which use leverage to juice market gains , or losses . " My wife is more realistic than I am and realizes we could lose all our money , " says Byrd . " I ca n't bear to consider it . " <p> The Byrds ' desperate strategy reflects the dilemma savers now face as their retirement looms and the window of investing opportunity lowers . But their hell-for-leather strategy lowers their odds of getting a decent retirement , as the following precepts will explain . 1 GET RICH SLOWLY <p> A common mistake during the boom years : letting the targeted retirement dates and lifestyle dictate return assumptions , rather than the other way around . Thus it was easy to assume that stocks would keep returning 15% a year ( as they had in the recent past ) : It was the only way to make it plausible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may find yourself in a desperate gamble to catch up  --  like Robert Byrd . <p> Better system : Come in with lower return assumptions , then set your targets for how soon you can retire and how well . It may mean working longer or saving a larger percentage of your paycheck now . <p> What 's a reasonable return assumption for your portfolio ? A long-term Treasury bond yields 5.4% annually . You can do better than that with a riskier corporate bond ( if it does n't default ) , but you wo n't do hugely better . You might easily earn 7% on a preferred stock or real estate investment trust , but at a still-greater risk of loss of the principal . Stocks are likely to return more over long periods but carry greater risk of getting clobbered in any one year or two . <p> Of course , not everyone is of the age or means to wait for the rebound . Tom E. Polcyn , a 57-year-old retired electrical engineer who owned a ham radio components company , paid $5 for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . His first home run was 100 shares of Intel picked up in 1991 for $3,900 . At its peak the stock was worth $171,000 . An avowed risk-taker , Polcyn , of Eudora , Kans. , parlayed $20,000 in 1988 into $1.3 million in 2000 by investing in the likes of AOL , Cisco and Yahoo . <p> He has lost $650,000 of it since . Friends joke that he should consider becoming a greeter at the local Wal-Mart to make ends meet . His sense of humor intact , Polcyn is staying as fully invested in the market as possible . " I believe wholeheartedly the market will turn around , " he says . " I believe in America and that the next ten years will bring some amazing opportunities . Crises beget new things , whether they 're in tech , biotech or airport security . " <p> He had better hope that bright day dawns sooner rather than later . Meanwhile , he has been cashing in some stocks and refinanced his home to pay bills . 2 TAKE CALCULATED RISKS <p> God knows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A crude indicator is how long relatives lasted . Yes , healthy eating , exercise and good medical care can add years to your life . A companion issue is how long your investments will be around . <p> A welter of retirement planning programs are on the Web that attempt to divine this question . With the first kind , called deterministic models , you plug in your portfolio size , your projected growth rate for it and your inflation expectations ; the programs tell you how long your holdings should last . A typical calculator might , for example , assume you retire at 65 with $1 million and withdraw $65,000 a year , inflation-adjusted . If you earn a steady 6.5% real return , the money lasts forever . If . The variant on Forbes.com asks you how much you 'll need in retirement , then gives you the present value of that sum , letting you see how far along you are today toward realizing your goals . <p> The deterministic programs work as an initial step . But they can also be very misleading . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the bubble collapsed , people were blithely assuming double-digit returns and putting away less than they should . The retirement calculator on the National Association of Securities Dealers Web site tells a 45-year-old with no portfolio how to retire in 20 years with the current equivalent of an $80,000 annual income : Earn 16.6% and he only need invest $11,100 annually . Pull returns back to 7% , nearer the norm , and it turns out he needs $57,000 . <p> Better , use a more sophisticated , probabilistic program for a view on how likely your assumptions are to pan out . These models crunch investment returns and inflation possibilities based on historical trends . For someone retiring at 65 with $1 million and withdrawing $65,000 a year , research firm Ibbotson Associates comes up with a 10% chance the investor will run out of money at age 77 , 25% at 81 and 50% at 88 ( see chart , below ) . You can access such programs from Morningstar ( www.morningstar.com ) at $100 per year , and for free from Nobel prize winner William Sharpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( troweprice.com ) . <p> Beyond that : how durable is your asset allocation ? Say you retire at 65 with a $1 million portfolio . You anticipate living 25 more years and withdrawing 7% , or $70,000 , a year . Your best chance ( 96% probability ) at that point of going the distance , according to a study by Trinity University in San Antonio , is a 50-50 stock-bond split . With only stocks it 's a bit less , 87% , and with only bonds it 's a mere 26% ( see chart , p. 110 ) . <p> The more you withdraw , the less chance you have of stretching out the money . Oregon investment adviser William Bernstein suggests taking out a fixed percentage , as opposed to a fixed dollar amount , which reduces your dollar depletion when market prices are low . That tactic should easily see you through 30 years . The downside is that you must soldier through some lean times . THWART INFLATION <p> Forget the old adage that the percentage you should be in fixed income equals your age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on . Inflation , unpredictable and sometimes devastating ( as in the late 1970s ) , does not stop on the day you retire . You might live another 30 years . <p> Over the past 75 years , stocks have returned an average 7.3% annually after inflation , long-term Treasurys 2.2% and Treasury bills only 0.7% . While stock prices have swung 50% up or down in a single year , their worst decade had them losing only 1% annually ( see chart , left ) . Your best bet : Arrange your finances so you can let your stocks ride for 15 years or more . <p> If you ca n't hold your breath that long , consider an inflation-indexed Treasury bond . The ten-year ones yield 3.5 percentage points above the annual gain in the cost of living . The less safe , but potentially higher-returning defense against inflation , is to own assets that wo n't be wiped out if inflation surges back  --  namely , real estate ( your suburban house , or shares in a real estate investment trust , or farmland ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your precise tolerance for the risk of losses , diversifying your assets should be axiomatic . Too heavy a concentration in bonds leaves you vulnerable to inflation . Be overweighted in stocks and you may get ( some ) protection against inflation but none against recessions . DODGE TAXES LEGALLY <p> Think about your family 's assets as pieces of an integrated portfolio , even though those pieces are in different baskets . What 's in your 401(k) affects what should be in your taxable accounts or in your spouse 's 401(k) . Decide what your composite mix of cash , real estate , stocks and bonds should be , then how best to get that balance given the investment options available in each . <p> After letting his portfolio get way out of whack , Gerald Rhineston , 58 , is aggressively trying to rebalance . The DaimlerChrysler employee had $500,000 in retirement savings all in stocks two years ago . He has suffered the agony of watching $200,000 of it vanish . Burned once , the Mt . Clemens , Mich. resident plans to split his assets evenly among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fla . <p> Tax considerations play a large role in divvying up the investments . Bonds ( other than tax-exempt ones ) are better off in one of the tax-deferred accounts . The best place for your first chunk of real estate allocation is the house you live in rather than a REIT , because of the huge tax favoritism for owner-occupied housing . <p> Growth stocks make a lot of sense in a taxable account . Why ? Because you can play tax favorites there . Hang onto winners and ditch losers . You can use capital losses to absorb any amount of capital gains and up to $3,000 a year ( for couples ) in ordinary income like salary . <p> Rhineston is also cold-bloodedly taking $40,000 in losses . " I have friends who wo n't touch a stock until they break even , but nothing says they 'll ever get there , " he says . " It makes more sense to me to take losses and move on to better opportunities . " WORK LONGER <p> The financial advantages of continuing to collect a paycheck are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fewer years you draw on your stash . <p> Barry and Patricia Wyatt , both 59 and married 31 years , live in Rochester Hills , Mich. and are hoping to spend their retirement traveling around the U.S. and vacationing during winter in Florida . Patricia quit working in 1995 . Two years later Barry , an environmental health supervisor , got a lump sum from his employer and invested 60% of it  --  the equivalent of ten years ' salary  --  in stock , mainly tech names . Then the market tanked . Barry , who had hoped to retire next year at 60 , now plans to work until 62 . " The whole idea is to make sure we can do the things we want and not just have to sit home and pay bills , " he says . <p> Extending working years sometimes actually allows you to ratchet back your savings , thus enhancing your pre-retirement lifestyle . Fredrick Adkins , a financial planner in Little Rock , Ark. , ran the numbers for a 45-year-old living on $120,000 a year after tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95% chance his money will last until age 83 , he must save $7,100 a month while working . Push out retirement to 65 and needed savings falls to $4,200 . EMPLOY EMPLOYER 'S STOCK <p> One way to turbocharge your retirement savings is by buying stock your company offers employees at below-market prices . Some 8.5 million workers hold shares in their employers , worth $400 billion , acquired either through options or employer matches to 401(k) contributions , according to the National Center for Employee Ownership . <p> Turning down this windfall is crazy . Holding on to it is , too . Concentrating your holdings in a single company , particularly the one that pays your salary , is not good diversification and not smart . Consider a Lucent Technologies executive who retired early last year at 50 with $4 million in company stock and held on to avoid a big capital gains hit . The stock then slid 92% . That forced the hapless executive back into the workforce . <p> One tactic ( especially if you 're legally restricted from selling the shares immediately ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading at $45 . For about 8% to 10% of each share 's value you can buy put options that give you the right but not the obligation to sell the shares for $40 each . If the share price plummets , your downside is limited . If it soars the gain 's all yours and you lose only the option premium . <p> If your position is large enough you can get a Wall Street firm to custom-design a derivative that is equivalent to buying protective puts on your stock holdings while selling call options . The minimum for this kind of fancy footwork is $1 million to $10 million . The tax treatment may be better than the treatment for listed option trades . MAKE THE HOUSE PAY <p> No , your house is unlikely to be a racy investment . Even with the runup in recent years , house prices have appreciated just 6.3% annually since 1968 . After inflation the figure falls to 1.5% . That 's less than long-term Treasurys pay , but there 's a big advantage to the real estate : Its returns are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $500,000 ( on a joint return ) from the capital gain on a house , and you can repeat this trick every two years . In posh towns like Tiburon , Calif. and Pound Ridge , N.Y. , very ordinary four-bedroom homes held over the past three decades have had gains of that magnitude . If your stock portfolio is a mess , you could move from a ritzy suburb and invest the difference in home prices to pay bills . <p> If moving is unthinkable , and you 're at least 62 , consider a reverse mortgage . The beauty of these beasts is that they allow you to stay in a house for life . Every month the bank sends a check ( on the order of $750 a month for a $200,000 house ) . When the owner dies , the bank sells the house and hands over any remaining equity to your estate . It 's unlikely to be much . <p> The origination fees and interest charges on reverse mortgages are high  --  not good tidings for your heirs because they are subtracted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you take out such a mortgage , you 'll have to stay alive for 30 years to get more cash out of the deal than your house is likely to be worth . <p> But that 's not your problem . Harsh as the notion sounds , you 've funded your retirement . <p> GRAPH : Reducint Risks <p> GRAPH : Same Imputs , Different Outcomes <p> GRAPH : Will It Last ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Shattered Nest Egg/His dreams of early reitrement evaporated when his tech-heavy portfolio fell apart .
