The Year of the Flood <p> The rain came unexpectedly , after nearly three years of drought . In those days , Youssef still lived with his mother in a whitewashed house that huddled with others like it along a narrow dirt road . The house had one room with no windows , and a roof made of corrugated tin held down by rocks . The yard , where his mother did the cooking and the washing , was open to the sky . It was in the yard that she cleaned the sheep hides she took in on the day of Eid , and there Youssef received the rare friends who came to visit . The front door was painted blue , but over the years rust had eaten its edges , turning them reddish brown , so that holes had begun to appear at each of the four corners . <p> They were having lunch when it began to drizzle , the thin raindrops making craters as they landed on the fava bean soup . Youssef 's mother looked up at the sky for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ignited inside her , she jumped to her feet , grabbed the soup pot by its ears , and took it to the bedroom . Youssef 's first thought was of the framed black-and-white picture of his father , which hung on the yard wall , above the divan . He took it inside , wiping the raindrops off the glass with the hem of his shirt . His father gazed back at him - a young man in his twenties , in a dark suit and gray tie , with his hair combed back neatly , as if he were on his way to an important appointment . His smile was timid , or perhaps reluctant ; Youssef had never been able to tell . He left the picture next to his bed and went back outside . <p> His mother had already picked up the bowls and the loaf of bread , so he grabbed the radio and carried it to the water closet . He lifted the divan on which they had been sitting and positioned it on its side , under the green awning that ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just enough room there for the table as well . His mother finished collecting the laundry - now everything was safe . <p> They stood together at the door of the bedroom , arms folded , watching the rain . " The year might turn out to be good , " Youssef said . He was thinking of the farm laborers who had been moving into the city , chased by the drought . They came from the Gharb , from the Chaouna , and even from as far south as Marrakech , here to Casablanca , where their teenage children crowded the markets and drove down wages for every kind of labor . Maybe this year there would not be as many of them . <p> His mother looked up at him . " We 're already in March , " she said . " It 's too late for the rain to do most crops any good . " <p> " Your flowers , at least , wo n't mind it , " Youssef said , glancing at the row of potted roses , daisies , and gardenias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rescued the flowers from the trash cans at the hospital where she worked , brought them home , and nursed them back to health . It was a rare indulgence ; she was a woman who valued work over pleasure , utility over beauty . And she was beautiful . The week before , she had turned thirty-nine , and though her hair was streaked with gray and her forehead lined with wrinkles , her green eyes and high cheekbones gave her a distinguished , almost aristocratic look . <p> At length , they sat down on the straw mat , facing the open door . Youssef 's mother dipped her bread in the thick soup and tasted it . " It 's all cold now , " she said . " I 'll reheat it for you . " <p> " Do n't trouble yourself , a-mmi , " he said . Always , she doted on him like this , as though he were eight instead of eighteen . Even though he discouraged her constant attention , it never occurred to him to resent it . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put on his sneakers and checked his watch . He wondered what movie he would see this week at the Star Cinema , but even before he could ask his mother for ticket money , she was already sorting through her purse . She handed him a coin . " Do n't forget your jacket , " she said . He left the house , hunching his shoulders against the light rain , and headed for the theater . <p> The Star was not , strictly speaking , a cinema . This would have been obvious to anyone who visited the dilapidated building that stood across from a butcher and a tailor on one of the garbage-strewn alleyways of Hay An Najat . Nevertheless , that was the name that a Casablanca charitable association had given to the place where , every week , a new older movie was projected on a cracked screen , and where patrons competed with rats for space on the gutted seats . For five dirhams , Youssef could watch Hong Kong action films , Bollywood romances , Egyptian dramas , or American blockbusters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had dreamed of becoming an actor . He had performed in the only play his high school had ever put on , a reenactment of the Green March , and he had spent long afternoons playing football , hoping to have the athletic chest that was appropriate for the moment when , shirtless , he would raise the Moroccan flag and lead his fellow civilians to reclaim the Spanish border post in the Sahara . He loved inhabiting the life of the hero , loved feeling his triumph , and when the audience applauded , a surge of euphoria , much like the one he had felt when he had tried hashish with Amin and Maati , ran through him . Of course , Youssef knew that his dream was unachievable - no different than wanting to win the lottery when you ca n't even afford to buy a ticket - but it provided a refuge from the more sobering turns he knew his life would , by necessity , have to take : finish high school , go to university , and , with any luck , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out of Hay An Najat . <p> This week , the Star Cinema was showing Boyz N the Hood . Right away Youssef knew that it would not be a big hit with his friends : there were no explosions , no car chases , and , most unforgivable of all , only one naked woman - and she did n't even face the camera . But he stayed glued to his seat because of Laurence Fishburne 's fatherly presence , his smooth voice and limitless experience . Youssef had lost his own father at the age of two , so his memories were few , and also faint . He remembered a tall man walking through the doorway , a hand tousling his hair , the smell of a stuffed pipe at night , but , maddeningly , little else . <p> Whatever tangible knowledge he had of his father came to him at second hand , from his mother . Nabil El Mekki was a fourth-grade teacher , respected by colleagues and students alike for his dedication . Back then , the family lived in an apartment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night or on weekends to save enough money for a house . Some neighbors who were preparing for a big Eid party asked him to hang lights on their roof . He tripped on a wire and fell down three floors , breaking his neck on a cart filled with roasted sheep heads . He died instantly . It was an accident , the doctors said , though everyone called it fate - mektub - for how else could one accept that such a young man had died so needlessly ? <p> Of course , Youssef and his mother were n't the only people in Hay An Najat without a father or a husband , but they seemed to be the only ones without any family . She was an orphan , raised in the French orphanage at Bab Ziyyat . After her husband 's death , she had moved from FFs to Casablanca but refused to stay in touch with Nabil 's parents , who had cheated her out of the meager inheritance . This was why , growing up , Youssef had often felt that he and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie , Youssef walked out of the theater into the darkening afternoon , making his way around the puddles of water , heaps of trash , and pieces of metal . It was raining a little more steadily now , and the clouds hung low , shrinking the horizon in all directions . He always found it hard to go home after a movie . He needed time to adjust to real life , where heroes and villains could not be told apart by their looks or their accents , where women did not give themselves over on the first date , where there were no last-minute reversals of fortune . <p> He wanted to buy roasted sunflower seeds or chickpeas , but the cart vendors near the theater had all left because of the rain . Amin and Maati , who could usually be found at the street corner , had retreated under the blue awning of a hanout farther down the road . Standing between crates of wrinkled oranges and dark mint , they were arguing about the Widad and the Raja ' , the odds of either football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between the Widadi goalkeeper and a taxi driver ? " Maati asked , flashing a wide , gap-toothed smile . Even though it was cold , he wore a short-sleeved shirt . Youssef suspected it was because Maati liked to show off his biceps . <p> " What ? " Youssef asked with a smile . <p> " The taxi driver only lets in three at a time . " <p> Amin clicked his tongue . " You wo n't be joking like that when the Widad defeats the Raja ' . And anyway , that 's an old joke . Tell us one we have n't heard . " <p> " All right , " Maati said . " What 's the difference between a girlfriend and a wife ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Twenty-five kilos . " <p> This time , Amin slapped his thighs and laughed . <p> " Here 's another one , " Maati continued . " What 's the difference between a bucket of shit and the government ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maati lit a cigarette and passed it around . A girl none of them knew walked up the lane , carrying a bag . They watched her pass them by . Her wet sweater clung to her body , showing the faint lines of her bra and the tips of her nipples . " Come here , kitten , " Amin said . <p> The kitten did n't acknowledge him . <p> " Hshouma , " Youssef said . " You should respect the girl . " <p> " Come on , my brother , " Amin said . " Let us live a little . Did n't you see those breasts ? " <p> " Her name 's Soraya , " Maati reported . " Her family just moved in , three streets up that way . Stay away from her , or her brother might come find you . " <p> " Youssef 's bringing us bad luck , " Amin said . " She 'd have talked to me if he was n't around , looking so serious , wanting to respect her . " <p> All three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken by Amin 's brother Fettah to visit a prostitute , where their Eid money had bought them ten minutes each . Now they dreamed of doing it with a girl their own age , someone who would , unimaginably , let them go all the way . <p> " She would n't have talked to you , " Youssef said . " She 's not the type . " <p> " And how do you know this ? " Amin asked , narrowing his eyes in a playful way , already sure of the answer . <p> Youssef shrugged . <p> " That 's what I thought , " Amin said , laughing . " So let me try my luck . " <p> The rain grew heavy . Youssef walked hurriedly home and was soaked by the time he arrived . He found his mother struggling to move the divan , carefully covered with a plastic tablecloth , to the bedroom . " It 's just some rain , " he said . " Do we need to move everything inside ? " <p> " It 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of immediately thinking about the worst outcome to any situation , and Youssef had long ago learned not to argue when she got into one of these moods . He took the divan inside . " Can you put some more plastic on the roof ? " she asked , and while he did that , she lined his side of the bedroom with pieces of cardboard to keep out the damp . <p> Inside , he changed out of his wet clothes . When he sat on his bed , his eye fell on his father 's picture , and immediately he noticed that a drop of water had seeped in between the frame and the photograph , darkening the print . He grabbed the picture , running his palm over the spot - his father 's forehead - as though he could dry it . In frustration , he put it back down on the floor and rummaged under his bed for his history textbook . His high school exams were just three months away . Amin and Maati always complained that they were required to learn things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor . An actor could learn lines . <p> * * * <p> The weather forecast had said that it would clear up late in the evening , but it rained furiously all night long . Youssef could not sleep for the sound of the water drumming the tin roof and the wind thrashing the bathroom door . Halfway through the night , just as he had begun to drift into slumber , he heard a group of men splashing down the alley , arguing loudly . He pulled his blankets up to his chin and turned to the wall , where the cardboard had begun to smell of ink . <p> In the morning , he could not go out to meet his friends because it was still pouring . He studied by the yellow light of the lamp , fiddled with the radio for a while , and then grew restless . His mother was knitting a sweater , her eyes fixed on the Mexican telenovela showing on television . She was different from the other women in Hay An Najat , he knew . The widow , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on their faces , as though his mother were a leper , as though widowhood were contagious . The fact that she could speak flawless French somehow exacerbated their resentment ; they said she put on airs . And she was not given to large displays of emotion . Aside from a few photographs , she had not saved any of his father 's relics - a ring , a watch , a book , some prayer beads . <p> Youssef , too , was different from the other boys . Until he was twelve or thirteen , he had never been left alone in the house while his mother was at work . Instead , his mother told him to play in the hospital garden or go across the street to the used-book store , whose cashier she knew . He spent all his summer days sitting between stacks of books , reading . He had grown five centimeters in the past year alone and towered over all his friends . And then there were his eyes - sky blue , bright turquoises - nearly out of place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Najat . You would expect his eyes on a Fassi , a descendant of the Moors , one of those pedigreed men who had for generations controlled the destiny of the nation . You might expect them on a tribal chieftain from the Atlas , though even there they might come with the freckled skin of Berber ancestors . You would not expect those eyes in the melting pot of misery and poverty that was Hay An Najat . <p> Youssef had to wrap his shoes in plastic before going to school the next day , and in the unheated classrooms he regretted not wearing the additional pair of socks his mother had pressed into his hands that morning . When he came home , he found that water had trickled through an opening in the roof onto his mattress . He climbed back onto the roof to adjust the blocks of concrete , then stripped the sheets and blankets off the bed and set them to dry . But at least the television and the radio seemed to be in working order . <p> By the time his mother came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drizzle . She asked him to go buy some flour , oil , and sugar , so he left the house and headed down the muddy road toward the hanout . At the first intersection , water pooled into a little pond , from which emerged a rusted old signpost , upright and persistent like a warning . In the next row of houses , the water ran into a rivulet . It quickly met with other tributaries to form a river , brown and fast and hungry . Youssef stopped at the bottom of the street . The river before him carried possessions away with it , like offerings to an ancient god - a suitcase , some tires , a broken bicycle , a few cinder blocks . A yelping dog swam helplessly in the middle of the debris . <p> Holding on to the wall , Youssef craned his neck to see if he could make it to the grocer 's , but all along the little street , shops and houses were flooded . Hammad came out of his store , pushing a wheelbarrow stacked high with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dirty water . Standing where the water was shallow , the tailor yelled into his mobile phone , asking someone to come help him . Through the broken window of the beauty shop , a blond-wigged mannequin head with painted lips surveyed the scene dispassionately . <p> Across the street , three red cushions floated aimlessly outside the gaping doors of the Star Cinema . Youssef felt a pinch in his heart at the sight , though he had no time to dwell on the damage to the theater because , just a few feet away , knee-deep in the water , men and women were moving their belongings . A man and his two sons turned the corner toward him , carrying a chipped divan base , a torn mattress , and a table . In places where the mud was too slippery , they held on to house walls or laundry lines . Youssef ran up behind the smaller of the sons to help him with the table . They were moving to an uncle 's house , the boy told him . It was the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything and , at the same time , to have everyone see that you did not own anything worth saving . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
