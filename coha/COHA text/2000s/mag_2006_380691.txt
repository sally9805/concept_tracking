In eerie strobe light , a black rider rears its steed ( a man and puppet on stilts ) , sending fearful hobbits scurrying . Dead men rise from the Marshes ( a roiling silver sheet ) to make war against Sauron 's legions . In the Mountains of Moria , Gandalf battles the enormous Balrog ( an Erector-set confection with steaming orange eyes ) as the sound effects roar and a strong wind gusts from the stage , spraying the audience with a blizzard of black confetti . As for Frodo , he not only lives , he also sings in the new version of The Lord of the Rings , opening this week at the Princess of Wales Theatre in Toronto . <P> A stage musical of J.R.R. Tolkien 's fantasy saga ? Good Lord , why ? Well , for starters , because the original three-volume story was filled with music  --  more than 50 songs that added levity and lyricism to the military drumbeat of its narrative . And also because : Why not ? LOTR is certainly an alluring franchise ; it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and ( sorry , George Lucas ) the all-time top-grossing movie trilogy . So producer Kevin Wallace raised about $24 million , from private and Canadian government sources , to mount a 3 1/2-hr. epic  --  the longest musical this side of Wagner  --  and the most expensive Broadway-style show ever , though it 's at least two years from playing New York City . <P> The preparation for a typical musical has its familiar anxieties : cutting a favorite song , replacing a dialogue scene , finding some extra business for the star . That 's nothing compared with the three-year ordeal of bringing Middle-earth to life . The mostly British creative team , beginning with playwright Shaun McKenna , had to figure out how to choreograph the complex battles Tolkien described ; how to visualize the dozen realms in the saga and the dozens of characters of many species ; how to blend narrative , drama and music in a three-act production  --  and do it all without retakes or post-production computer effects . Most daunting was the task of satisfying all those Tolkienites whose image of Middle-earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and latterly by Peter Jackson 's Oscar-laden film versions . <P> If it occurs to you that the idea is mad , you are n't the first . " I thought it was foolish , " said director Matthew Warchus . He believed it would be " instantly plausible " to do the Ring as a spoof . " It 's such an earnest story , and people are so protective of it . " Still , he signed on . Then he and musical supervisor Christopher Nightingale chose to break with the Broadway songwriting style and go for an ethereal , world-music sound . Two sounds , in fact : one from A.R . Rahman , the best-selling composer of Indian musical films ; the other from the Finnish group Vrttin . <P> That produced a fascinating musical fusion , but it did n't allay the doubts that most of the creators had , straight through rehearsals , about their quest and their sanity . Says set and costume designer Rob Howell : " Every other day one of us was wondering out loud , ' What . Are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , as a visit to the show in its last week of previews revealed , is to create a robust summary and emotional evocation of the story  --  the one LOTR you can consume in a single evening and say , with a satisfied smile , " Yes . That 's it . "
