It 's all in the wrists : Tom Bloom of Troop 318 saws wood the pioneer way . The secret : Pull back and forth with your partner and let the saws sharp teeth do the work . // Bone-chilling cold ca n't stop these Colorado Scout campers from fun in the snow . Despite the bitter cold morning , Joshua Williams crawled from his toasty sleeping bag , ready to race a homemade snow sled across a Colorado mountain some two miles high . The 13-year-old strapped on snowshoes , then joined his buddies from Grand Junction , Colo. , Troop 316 , pushing and pulling their sled around a 500-foot course that seemed covered in glue , not snow . Photograph " Mush , you guys ! " Scouts hustle to complete the 500foot circuit of the timed sled race-the day 's toughest event . Everyone may start out on snowshoes , but not everyone finishes that way . // Groaning in the thin air , the Scouts huffed and puffed the big wooden racer along the course-down a slope , around a sweeping turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the clock , and their own exhaustion , they finally shoved their sled across the finish line . Time : about one minute . Joshua hardly noticed . Lying in the snow , gulping for air , he had enough breath for only one word- " Tired ! " Surival Skills Grand Mesa is thrust into the Colorado sky like a gigantic table . Mesa is Spanish for table . Covering this 10,800-foot-high table is a thick cloth of snow . Last February , 85 Colorado Scouts from 17 troops gathered in the bone-chilling cold on the windswept summit to improve their winter sports and survival skills . The idea was to learn how to be prepared and have fun at the same time . One challenge : fire-building , among the most important of all outdoor skills to master . Scouts had to make a blaze from scratchthey could use homemade fire starters , such as sawdust or cardboard soaked in paraffin-then bring a quart of water to a boil in 20 minutes . Working fast , the Wapiti Patrol of Troop 477 , Paonia , Colo. , built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface so the fire would not sink in snow and-pffi ! - fizzle out . They added their fire starter , piled kindling on , struck a match . Tada ! The small pieces of dry wood caught . The Scouts carefully added larger pieces of wood , building ever bigger flames . Next , using a stout stick , they suspended a pot of water over the flames . Photograph // Soon , steam began rising , followed by a roaring Wapiti cheer-their quart of water had begun boiling . Let Me Think Elsewhere came more challenges : tying knots and lashings , performing first aid , signaling messages and-almost everyone 's favorite  --  surviving the Surprise Station . Old Man Winter knows lots of ways to fool you ; learning to deal with his surprises can save your life . Thus , the Surprise Station , where each patrol got several short sticks , some lengths of rope and instructions to retrieve a distant bucket without crossing a line in the snow . Essentially an engineering problem , the Scouts had to figure out how to lash together the sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong enough to coax it back over the line . The Wapiti Patrol solved the first half of the problem but moved too quickly and dropped the bucket . A moan went up . " Let 's go again ! " someone said . " Slower this time . " Patiently , they extended the stick and gently brought back the bucket . At day 's end , their hard work and high spirits paid off : The Wapitis were named best overall . No Swea . Oh , Yeah ? Older Scouts , meanwhile , spent the morning skiing , snowshoeing and working on cold weather survival . " This is my first time on skis , " grinned David Bentley , a Star Scout from Team 324 in Fruits . " It 's great . " David , like the other Scouts , kicked off with his back foot , glided with his front foot and pushed with his ski poles . The boys found that skiing works the whole body . And the whole body gets hot . They quickly learned that skiing can break a good sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troop 347 was back for his third year of winter Scouting on the mesa . Summing up the day , he said : " It teaches me a lot about getting out in the cold . And it 's fun ! " BUILD A BOYS ' LIFE SNOW SLED Do n't sit inside when the snow flies .

Inset : Tenderfoot Scout Donny Warbritton , 12 with a bowline in the knot-tying event Sidebar WHEN COLD WINDS BLOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidebar Brrrr . It 'll be cold , but not awful . Then the announcer says to expect winds up to 20 miles per hour . Suddenly you have a wind chill Sidebar factor to consider . The wind chill factor is an index of how fast your body cools off . The faster the wind blows , the faster you lose body heat , A 20 m.p.h. wind makes 40 degrees feel like 18 degrees . Sidebar But wind chill is also a tricky concept . For example , the wind can not lower your skin temperature below that of the ambient , or surrounding , air . If the thermometer reads 40 , that 's as cold as your skin can Sidebar get , even if it feels a lot colder . However , wind makes you more vulnerable to hypothermia , which often occurs at ambient temperatures in the 50 's and above . At temperatures below freezing , frostbite develops faster with wind . Sidebar ABC 'S OF KEEPING WARM Sidebar A void hypothermia , the Colorado Scouts on Grand Mesa were told . You should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while wicking away sweat from your skin . Wool and synthetics ( such as fleece ) do the job . Do n't wear cotton ; it absorbs miosture , then turns cold . You lose most of your body heat through your head , so wear a warm cap , preterably one that covers your ears . For your hands mittens are better than gloves because they keep your fingers together , allowing them to warm one another . A well-hydrated and well-fed Scout is less likely to develop hypothermia . Carry plenty of water ands snacks . When your body burns food , it creates heat .
