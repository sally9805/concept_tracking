Chapter One : Gray Hill North Wales , Summer 1351 Maelgwyn 's " husbandly attention , " as he called it , went on and on . Strange , how time could creep and crawl . The room grew darker as the fire died . " Have you no answer , Elise ? " Had he posed a question ? Lying there , all she 'd heard was the sighing of the wind , outside , and the faint rush of blood in her ears . He stared down into her face . " Or is this unamiable silence yet another sign of your waywardness ? " This required some reply . " I have never studied to be wayward to you , sir , " she said . " Hah . You require no study , being a born mistress of the art . " He reached down to pinch her thigh , his usual way of emphasizing a point . She bit back a cry but knew there would be a bruise . " Had you been attending , wife , you would have heard me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I able to fathom your ingratitude . Who are you to be ungrateful ? Better souls than you suffer every hour . As we speak , worthy Welshmen bleed on French battlefields . In the course of the Great Mortality , thousands of good Christians fell . Yet you survived , Elise . Then you were so fortunate as to come here to me . Deo dilecti . But why ? " Deo dilecti . Chosen by God . When had she so offended her Maker thatshe had been chosen by Him , for this ? " It is as great a mystery to me as it is to you , " she said , without equivocation . " So I should imagine . But are you happy to be alive , rejoicing in my protection and devotion ? No , I fear you are not . The pitiful dowry you brought with you does not compensate me for your relentless ingratitude , I assure you . " She closed her eyes for a moment , considering that dowry . It had not been pitiful , she knew . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by contradicting Maelgwyn . So she opened her eyes and said , " Merely I am worn from the demands of the day and the household . There 's only Annora to aid me . " Then she lied . " But I am not ungrateful . " Would the reasonable excuse of fatigue stem a more grueling interrogation ? The truth would never do . She could n't tell this cruel man how she loathed and feared him , how the very sight of him  --  his long , muscled trunk and ox 's neck  --  had become so abhorrent to her it was almost past bearing . Further , the truth could finally tip the scales of his volatile temper , a temper grown increasingly vicious in the two years since she had come to his rambling old house , Bryn-llwyd . Gray Hill . " I confess , " he was saying , " I forget from time to time that you are but a woman , the worst sort of stinking rose . The holy philosophers tell us all we need know of the sorry origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as he resumed his " husbandly attention . " She turned her head away to look down at the wooden floor , hoping to will her mind to some less hurtful place . A large black spider , speckled with yellow dots , crossed a rough plank near the hearth . It stopped and reared two of its legs , as if searching for some invisible passage . Then it lowered its legs and scurried toward a wall . What tales had she heard of spiders ? What had her servant and friend , Annora , told her ? Elise pondered the question to divert herself . Soon she remembered Annora 's words : to their webs spiders entice fallen souls who only appear to poor human eyes as trapped moths or mites , before herding them to Purgatory . But had n't Annora also said the creeping things were a blessing in the house , because they could miraculously absorb the poisonous Pestilence vapor , bind it to the spots on their backs ? Could these tales be true ? The evening wind grew stronger and shifted . Timbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new glass panes , Maelgwyn 's proudest acquisition and the first , he boasted , of many more to come , had been set into a triptych of branches hacked from a young oak . Still tall in its place but condemned to wither limb-stripped and then tumble down too early , that oak could no longer soften with its used-to-be leaves the view south to the empty Migneint Moor . It was Elise 's fancy that the triptych , stolen from the tree 's living body , would never contentedly cradle its fragile burden . And so it moaned softly with complaint . A fierce gust brought the faint scent of the garderobe to the solar . The privy had been corbeled out over the river next to the chamber , and often stank when gales blew from the west . " Fah , it reeks of cess in here , " said Maelgwyn , for once echoing his young wife 's thoughts . But she flinched , for his harsh voice had startled her . " You 're skittish as a maiden , girl . Does my affection overwhelm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet another of your unholy visions ? " This jibe targeted a susceptibility to trance , hers since the season of the Gemini moon in 1343 , eight years past , when she was eleven . Terrifying or glorious , her visions came unbidden , mostly eluding interpretation . To the past frustration of her loved ones , and now Maelgwyn , they often featured absolute strangers . Often , but not always . In trances , sometimes only vaguely remembered by her once they 'd passed , she had rightly foretold a rain of dying stars and spoken , most eerily , with the forgotten voice of the bard , Taliesin , who passed to Rapture in the days of Arthur and Myrddin . She had described strange landscapes and revealed to a lonely maiden the secret love of a neighbor . Likewise , many times she had predicted pregnancy . Or death . That final item , predicting death , could not be thought remarkable . Death had lately stopped in many houses . It had thrown its dark cloak over every valley and knoll in Britain . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four days north from Gray Hill , the gift of prophecy was regarded as God 's favor . When she was a child , her parents refused coins from neighbors hoping to crouch nearby , their ears cocked for any mystic rambling that may have chanced to fall from Elise 's young lips as she worked the spindle or sorted her mother 's herbs . Deep mystery was in her spells . Among a world of betters , why had God chosen her to deliver even the least vital word ? Or was it God who had chosen ? Elise understood there was no tisane or trick to calm her doubt on this . Was she God 's herald , or only Satan 's fool ? High wrought by what he called immoral superstition , Maelgwyn rebuked her for her trances without fail , and the previous winter he had lashed her with a studded whip one morning as she sat enthralled in a vision . Elise had felt no pain but had revived to the sight of three bright welts across her inner wrist . She had smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Father , Son , and Holy Ghost . " Her husband 's face had grown chalky white before he added more wounds , blurring the crimson edges of the original three . " Blasphemy ! " he cried and flung himself from the room . His ill temper had not softened since , but she preferred it more than she could say to his monstrous ardor . Now , in their solar , he pulled her up by her arms and dragged her from the bed without warning . She made an effort to stand upright but stumbled backward . Only a wooden chair behind her kept her from sprawling . At her seeming retreat , Maelgwyn 's hands dropped to his sides . His blue eyes glinted in the light of the tallow candle flickering on the table near the chamber 's closed door . Cast into ghostly relief by the candlelight , a dark vein pulsed at his temple . He swooped down to catch her wrists with one large hand and squeezed so hard that her fingers grew quickly numb . " You choose so blithely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , forcing her to her knees . " Like so . Only now do you strike the proper posture for supplication , Elise . " When she tried to pull away , he tightened his hold and seized the neck of her summer shift . She gasped as he ripped downward , rending the fine cloth . With a soft hiss , the ruined shift fell to the floor around her . " Did n't the great thinker Boethius tell us that woman is a temple built upon a sewer ? " he said , breathing a bit harder , but smiling . " Was he not a godly man ? " He reached around her and ran the blunt fingernails of his unoccupied hand down her spine . " Some of your gender will call that an overly harsh edict , of course . But what is a righteous man to do ? I must align myself with the Church 's precepts and declare every woman an Eve . " Face hot , legs icy , Elise ceased any effort to free herself and sagged into his grip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by weariness . I will not fight you anymore , " she said , staring up at him . " Let me rise so we may go on . I 'm too aroused to kneel . " She essayed a coy smile but knew it must be ghastly . " No , Elise . Your wan smile and gray eyes ca n't dupe me further tonight . I mistrust women with gray eyes , you know , for they always , always prove to be sinful . In any case , I am a prophet now . And I foresee the most practical way for a willful wife to absorb a husband 's teaching will be low and mean , so she may more easily comprehend it . That thought is balm for my distaste . I only pray my righteous seed is steered by Heaven to a smooth passage down your throat , toward your wicked soul . " He released her and inclined his head . " Move to me now , to ingest my probity . " Stronger hints of the privy assailed her as mounting winds buffeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disturbed the thatched roof above . Drifting to the floor beyond Maelgwyn , the resulting halo of fine dust shone in the candle 's glow . Not a soul would come if she called . No one would hear her cries , except perhaps her friend Annora , Gray Hill 's only other human inhabitant . Meanwhile her bare-chested husband stood between her and the door , hosen around his knees . " For shame , woman , " he finally said , as she gave no sign of obeying . Another gale shook the manor . Hail pinged against glass . With more urgency than grace , she tried to rise but tangled her feet in her torn shift . Maelgwyn yanked her up by her hair . " Any bleating ewe would be less trouble , " he said , dragging her back toward the bed . Twisting away at the last moment , she ran to the window . There , after two long years of cowardice , her caution deserted her . It dissolved like a tattered shadow . But in its stead it left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage . " A ewe ? I recommend one , sir , " she said , breath uneven . " Or an ass . A fine great ass for your mighty probity . " Without conscious thought she began to laugh like a madwoman . His thick brows drew together to form one black line . " Yet more shame , Elise . " Her laughter ceased as abruptly as it had begun . " Maelgwyn , can you not feel it ? Something taints you . Some evil . In this house you are the fountainhead of everything unholy , for your pleasure can only be bought with pain . How sad and rotten your soul must be , how endless your fear . Indict me if you must "  --  she wrapped her arms around herself , covering her breasts  --  " but you know full well your own foul craving will condemn you straight to Hell . " A sickly half smile played at the corners of his mouth , and his nostrils flared . Forcing herself to look into his face , she was shocked to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him only once before . He drew back slightly , as if sensing her discovery . " You 're frightened , " she said . He took a breath ; his broad chest swelled with it . And the fear disappeared from his eyes . " Afraid ? " he said . The word dripped with scorn . His teeth showed in a wider , crueler smile . " Of a godless female ? You 're a greater fool than I supposed . " " Likely I am . But I saw it . You had that same look another time , one other time only , just after I came here . " " Poor Elise . It 's almost amusing to witness your attempts to evade my wrath , and God 's . " Her eyes did not leave his face . She would will him to answer , will him to pay for his violent gratification with one small moment of truth . " You know it 's true . That first time , I described a vision I 'd had . It was before I knew to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you I saw a woman . She stood naked by a river and she wore a necklace of tiny starfish . She called your name . She  --  " " Your tactics pall . " " Who was she ? Your first wife ? Your mother ? " Silence fell , absorbing any warmth remaining in the room . Gooseflesh climbed her limbs . Her dark hair spilled down her back to her waist . Outside , the hail stopped , and the wind grew less violent . After a near eternity of quiet he spoke . He brought his hands to his chin , palms together as if in prayer . " What do you hope to gain by spewing your wicked tales , Elise ? You and I both know your visions are only a sorry plea for my attention . We both know you never prattled of any woman . " " I did , Maelgwyn . " He went on as if she had not spoken . " But by mouthing your lies , your evil fantasies , you have damned yourself with words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , as I 've imagined I might since we wed , if only to do God and other men a service . " He took a step toward her , and another . She shrank back with a cry . He stopped and gazed past her , to his new panes and the darkness beyond , to the unseen rushing river . " Who will weep ? I 'll say you fell to a revisiting of the Mortality . I 'll say you divined it yourself from a glimpse , in a vision , of a lake burning with brimstone . Is that not prophetic ? Tomorrow morning or the next , what fool would burrow into your grave to confirm the dreaded symptoms ? " Without moving his head he shifted his focus , regarding her from the corner of his eye . " Let she who is ripe ... fall . " " You 're mad , " she whispered . He lunged . Slammed back against the window , her knuckles hit a pane . Glass shattered , scoring uneven red lines down her arm . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad hand . As blood dripped from her elbow to her foot , he struck again . Shielding her head with her sound arm , she fell to the floor . " If I am to die , " she cried , " at least let me say a prayer of contrition . " He loomed over her , breathing hard . " My dear , " he said , with sudden real dismay , " I fear you are in the right . Yes , you must pray to Mary Magdalene . You must ask her to petition Heaven on your behalf  --  although I suspect it will be futile . " She cringed when he reached out , obscenely gentle , to stroke her hair . " Poor girl , where is my Christian compassion ? Yes , yes , you must certainly pray . " She looked up at him as he bent over her . " I already have , " she said  --  and drove a sharp glass dagger upward , hard , into his groin . He crashed to the floor , but then staggered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch , " he gasped . His arms shot out . His hands closed around her throat . As a gray mist swirled up before her , she lashed out blindly with the shard and heard him curse again . His hands dropped away from her neck . Once more the room grew still . Continues ...
