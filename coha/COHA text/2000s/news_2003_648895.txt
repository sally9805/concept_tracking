<p> The **31;331;TOOLONG San Francisco Giants had as comfortable a cushion as any major league team except the Atlanta Braves coming into this weekend , a stunning 12-game lead in the National League West . The Giants obviously have Barry Bonds , one of the premier players in the game , doing incredible things . But after reflexively citing Bonds , it is much more complicated to explain how and why the Giants have become so formidable . <p> Sure , there is Jason Schmidt , an ace with 12 victories . Yes , the Giants also made a shrewd trade by acquiring Sidney Ponson from the Baltimore Orioles minutes before the nonwaiver trade deadline 10 days ago . But Ponson 's presence is more about the postseason , and he did not help the Giants climb into such a rarefied position . <p> Who did ? Everyone else in uniform , especially Manager Felipe Alou . And Brian Sabean , the general manager . <p> The Giants have used two rookies in the pitching rotation ( Jerome Williams and Jesse Foppert ) , they have resurrected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. ) , they have a 38-year-old catcher in Benito Santiago and a 42-year-old first baseman in Andres Galarraga , and they have a versatile bullpen that has allowed them to overcome a season-ending injury to closer Robb Nen . <p> " I 'm not surprised we 're in first place , " Sabean said last week in an interview . " I 'm shocked we 're so many games up . I consider this a tough league . For us to play well as consistently as we have is pretty gratifying . " <p> After losing to the Anaheim Angels in the World Series last year , the Giants waved goodbye to Dusty Baker , who now manages the Chicago Cubs , and Jeff Kent , who now plays second base for the Houston Astros . But the drastic changes the Giants made  --  hiring Alou , injecting new starters at four positions and revamping their pitching staff  --  have boosted them , not buried them . <p> " My expectations were high , for me , " Alou said . " I have experience with bullpens and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do my job . If everyone does their job , we 're going to be successful . How successful ? We do n't know yet . " <p> The Giants have been successful because they are the best defensive team in the league and , Alou said , " the best defensive team I 've ever managed . " Still , the Giants do not lead the National League in any other significant categories . They were fourth in earned run average and tied for fifth in runs scored through Friday 's game . What they do have is a veteran club built to win while the 39-year-old Bonds is still feared , with four relievers who have each pitched in 53 games or more . Tim Worrell has 25 saves in 29 chances . <p> " I can go to any reliever at any time , " Alou said . " I 've been managing for a few days in my life . I still do n't trust matchups or statistics . I trust my own eyes . " <p> Because the Giants were performing exceptionally , Sabean felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade deadline approached . He thought that if he did not add a marquee player it might send the wrong message to the players who had worked diligently to guide the Giants to the top . Besides , Kirk Rueter was lying on a trainer 's table with shoulder stiffness as Sabean mulled over trading three young pitchers to snare Ponson , <p> The Giants sifted through nine scouting reports on Ponson , a chunky right-hander who was 14-6 with the Orioles , and felt he would thrive with their defense and in their ballpark . <p> " We felt we had to make a move , " Sabean said . <p> Other than Bonds 's typical .334 average , 35 homers and 74 runs batted in after yesterday 's game , the Giants ' skittish offense has worried Alou . Grissom ( .306 , 15 , 55 ) has been the second most productive Giant . Cruz has 16 homers , but hit 5 of them in the first eight games . The disappointing Edgardo Alfonzo and Rich Aurilia has combined for only 90 R.B.I. But Galarraga ( .308 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabean acknowledges the little things that have helped the Giants , but what has surprised him the most is one big thing : Bonds . <p> " Barry still amazes me , " Sabean said . " He 's not getting anything to hit in the course of an at-bat , and somehow he still affects the game . To me , he 's headed for his third straight M.V.P. I do n't know where we 'd be without him . " <p> Probably not in first , but that is where the surprising Giants are comfortably ensconced . <p> Maddux on a Roll <p> Greg Maddux has won five straight decisions to improve to 11-8 and enhance his chances of becoming the first pitcher to win 15 games for 16 straight seasons . Cy Young did it for 15 straight seasons . With 284 victories , Maddux has crawled closer to becoming the 22nd pitcher to notch 300 and could reach it around this time next season . <p> " I 'm really not motivated by 300 , " Maddux said in an interview earlier this season . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put thinking about 300 in the same category . What 's important is what I 'm doing now . If I look ahead , I 'm afraid I wo n't work as hard . " <p> His former teammate Tom Glavine , whose own quest for 300 has taken a hit because he is 7-11 with the Mets , wondered if Maddux was being coy . <p> " I think he knows what he does and what his numbers are a little bit more than he lets on , " Glavine said . " It 's not to say he 's obsessed by them . I 'm sure he knows how many wins he needs to get to 300 . Sometimes , he 'll play it off like he has no idea . I do n't believe that . " <p> One intriguing aspect of Maddux 's pursuit is whether he will remain in Atlanta to chase the milestone . Maddux signed a one-year contract for $14.75 million this season , but the Braves did not sign Glavine and dealt Kevin Millwood because of the money . How much will they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> " I mean , look what I did to stay here , " Maddux said . " I took one year . I had four or five from somewhere else . But I know I 'm mentally comfortable here . " <p> Closing on Sandberg <p> While Aaron Boone is becoming acclimated to the Yankees , his brother , Bret , who visited him in the Bronx this weekend , obviously has a home with the Seattle Mariners . The older and more outspoken Bret Boone has 29 homers , giving him 90 since the start of the 2001 season . According to Stats Inc. , if he hits seven more , he will surpass Ryne Sandberg for the most homers by a second baseman in a three-year period . Sandberg had 96 for the Cubs from 1989 to 1991 . But Boone should not be too comfortable if he overtakes Sandberg . Alfonso Soriano has 63 since 2002 , so he could make his own imprint at second . That is , if the Yankees do not shift Soriano to the outfield . <p> Showalter as Fan <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball field when he is managing the Texas Rangers , but Paul McCartney did . When Showalter saw Sir Paul sitting behind home plate at Yankee Stadium last Wednesday , he turned from the ultraserious manager to the little boy who idolized the Beatles and played guitar with his tennis racket . <p> " That was one of the biggest fights I had with my dad , " Showalter said . " Ca n't you see me with the tennis racket ? I remember going to the barber shop and having my father tell them to cut more off . Anyone my age wanted to be just like them . " <p> The 47-year-old Showalter did not attempt to introduce himself to Sir Paul , who arrived after the game had begun . Even a starry-eyed Showalter knew fraternizing during the game would have been misplaced . But Showalter watched and noticed that Sir Paul bobbed his head when the Yankees played " Y.M.C.A. "  --  not exactly " Hey Jude "  --  on the public-address system . <p> " That , " said Showalter , who managed the Yankees for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Costner on Deck <p> Since George Steinbrenner is so obsessed with how the Yankees look and act , one wonders what he thought of Roger Clemens 's standing in the corner of the dugout to chat with Kevin Costner during Wednesday 's game . Costner , who played catcher Crash Davis in the movie " Bull Durham , " was so close to the action , Manager Joe Torre could have summoned him to take a trip to the mound to talk with David Wells , too . <p> Clouded Crystal Ball <p> When Derek Jeter was a rookie in 1996 , a sporting goods company offered him $5,000 to sign 1,000 baseballs . The company backed out on the proposed deal because it wondered if the autographed balls would be a worthwhile investment . <p> Seven years later , that decision looks dubious . One memorabilia dealer said an autographed Jeter ball today runs about $250 , which would have been a return of 4,900 percent . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
