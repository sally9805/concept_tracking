From our labs to your list <p> Let 's do the math . This holiday season , the U.S. will harbor some 171 million adults , give or take a few lords a-leaping . If each person shops for 25 gifts ( the per-adult average for the past few years ) , that 's 4.275 billion presents destined to be bought . Lucky for you , the technical staff at Consumer Reports has been busy testing everything from B to W-that 's board games to wine . This guide is the result . It showcases high-rated , eminently giftable products we 've reported on during the past year or so ( all are still being sold , and they 're in Ratings order ) . We 've included advice about buying gifts online , along with a list of recommended web sites . Because the holidays are n't only about spending , we 've provided a certificate ( page 15 ) that lets you give a gift of time or service-perhaps an hour of babysitting or a home-cooked meal . And if you look beyond these pages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including cameras , breadmakers , and audio minisystems . Who knows ? Now that we 've done the legwork for you , the expression " shop till you drop " may become pass . Laptops <p> With brighter and larger displays , faster processors , and more efficient batteries , laptops are now in the same league as desktop computers-but they can cost twice as much . Keep in mind where the laptop will be used . All-in-one models like the Compaq shown here are heaviest and most appropriate for use at home . Slim-design models like the Apple can be a good choice for commuters and others who do n't leave home without their laptop . <p> Full report : June 2001 TABLE Garden pruners <p> Gardening has never been more popular , and pruners are an essential tool in a gardener 's arsenal . The two models below are excellent . The diminutive Felco , which is especially comfortable for small hands , makes consistently clean and easy cuts . The Fiskars is slightly larger , but you can set the handles to fit the spread of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats <p> Infant seats face to the rear and generally hold babies weighing up to about 20 pounds . Most double as carriers . Convertible seats face rearward until a child is at least one year old ; then they 're turned forward and used until the child weighs 40 pounds . Booster seats , for kids of about 40 to 80 pounds , use the car 's safety belt to restrain the child . The Evenflo booster is A CR Best Buy . The Graco Sterling travel system is a stroller plus the raco SnugRide infant seat . <p> Full report : July 2001 ; Update : September 2001 TABLE Cordless phones &; answerers <p> Cordless phones can now be as small and sleek as their cellular cousins . Digital phones in general are more immune to eavesdropping and interference than are analog phones ; DSS ( digital spread spectrum ) models also offer slightly longer range . The higher-frequency phones , 2.4 GHz , do n't offer better voice quality or range than 900-MHz models . Voice quality in the Uniden EXS was outstanding , and the EXI was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 TABLE Portable CD players <p> An excellent choice for music lovers on the go , today 's portable CD players are slimmer than before , more resistant to bumps , and more efficient with batteries . Many models will play CDs you 've " burned " yourself . Those below should withstand even vigorous jogging with few or no skips . The Panasonic is A CR Best Buy . <p> Full report : July 2001 TABLE Nonstick frypans <p> Friends or relatives who bring home the bacon need a pan that fries it evenly . Those below fill the bill . The Cuisinart is stainless steel ; the rest , anodized aluminum . All can be placed in an oven . <p> Update : February 2001 TABLE Board games <p> Our kid testers tried several ; best were those that made them think and could be shared with parents . In Cranium , two or more teams compete to win in four skill categories by drawing pictures blindfolded , humming tunes , and spelling words backwards , for example . Scotland Yard is a game of cooperation rather than competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture the mysterious Mr. X. Rush Hour , which is compact enough to play while traveling , is a puzzle game in which the player must unlock gridlock and drive a red car out of a traffic jam . TABLE Hedge clippers <p> Clippers should be convenient and comfortable to use . An expert gardener who participated in our tests praised the ARS8R ( from the A.M. Leonard catalog at www.amleo.com ) and the Eagle T.F.E. " I could work with ARS8R clippers all day , " she said . " They have every quality I could want in manual hedge clippers . " She called the Eagle T.F.E. " small but mighty . " <p> Front Lines : September 2001 TABLE Red wine <p> A fine choice for dinner hosts , merlots and pinot noirs complement not only red-meat dishes but also full-flavored fish such as salmon . In merlot , sometimes referred to as a smoother , mellower cousin of cabernet sauvignon , dark-berry and spicy aromas typically predominate . Pinot noir , lighter in character , is moderate in fruit , with hints of spices . With either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to spend a lot for high quality . The Rosemount Estate , an Australian merlot , is A CR Best Buy . <p> Full report : October 2001 TABLE Desktop computers <p> Weak demand for new computers has meant better values than ever . Most manufacturers offer three families of computers : entry level ( fewer features and relatively slow , but fine for most uses ) ; midrange ( the best value , with all that most people need for personal finances , home-office work , and other chores ) ; and cutting edge ( the fastest , with the largest hard drive and the greatest room for expansion , but not much better than midrange for everyday tasks ) . The models below are midrange . <p> Full report : September 2001 TABLE Rain jackets <p> They 've come a long way from the sweat-inducing rubber slickers of long ago . Many jackets can keep you dry and comfortable even in a downpour . Look for a hood and stiff visor , sealed seams , storm flaps along the zipper , and a cinched hem that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buy , has an inner zipper for layering with a vest or jacket . <p> Full report : March 2001 TABLE PDAs <p> Prices are down , especially for Palm and Handspring models , and rebates and deals abound . All-around PDAs ( personal digital assistants ) , whether by Kyocera , Handspring , or original maker Palm Inc. , use the Palm operating system to organize phone numbers , appointments , addresses , and the like . Just-the-basics organizers are all-around PDAs with less memory ; they can be harder to use . Computer stand-ins combine the functions of basic organizers with " pocket " versions of computer programs like word processing and spreadsheets . <p> Full report : May 2001 ; Update : September 2001 TABLE Food-prep appliances <p> A chopper is the choice for small tasks like mincing garlic or mashing vegetables for a baby 's dinner . For an aficionado of fruit smoothies ( and pured soup or grated Parmesan , for that matter ) , choose a blender . A food processor adds the ability to slice and shred . A hand mixer is especially good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixer 's ability to handle dough will be appreciated by bakers . <p> Full report : December 2000 TABLE M players <p> Music storage capacity , player size , and cost vary widely among models . The Creative Nomad players are especially rich in features . Make sure the player you choose will be compatible with the recipient 's computer . <p> Full report : July 2001 TABLE A gift of yourself <p> Fill in this certificate and cut it out to present someone with a gift of a home-cooked meal , babysitting time , help around the house , or whatever else might be appreciated . TABLE Printers <p> Inkjets now turn out very high-quality text and photos that rival the work of professional labs . They 're the sensible choice for most people . Laser printers are best for people who tend to print lots of text and do n't require color printing . Multifunction printers can also copy , fax , and scan . Most printers work with both Mac and Windows computers ; check to make sure your choice is compatible with the recipient 's computer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look for a late-2000 or 2001 manufacture date on the yard itself or on its box . That should ensure compliance with 1999 requirements that yard hinges undergo a strength test and lock automatically when rails are pulled upright . Check , too , for a seal from the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association certifying compliance with the standard . When shopping , consider the yard 's weight and size when packed . Casters or locking wheels are a plus . <p> Full report : July 2001 TABLE Give Advice <p> Our publications and web site help people make smart decisions and save money year-round . <p> Consumer Reports , $26 per year , including the Buying Guide .
