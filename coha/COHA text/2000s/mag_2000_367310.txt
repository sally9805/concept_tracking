A thousand years hence , Earth has succumbed to alien invaders called Psychlos . They are mining the planet 's mineral wealth while reducing what 's left of its population to slavery . The oppressors are personified by Terl ( John Travolta ) , a security officer who in some shots looks like a demented Dennis Miller , and his hulking assistant Ker ( Forest Whitaker ) . The " man-animals " are greatly in need of a heroic rebel , who appears as a guy actually named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler ( Barry Pepper ) . <P> Up to this point , Battlefield Earth is a coherent if banal narrative with Earth envisioned in standard dystopian style  --  muddy , rusty , all its famous buildings in ruins . It does n't take it long , however , to go from bad to worst , as in the worst movie in living memory . It is n't just that the dialogic cliches set the audience to hooting , hollering and offering satiric applause . Or that you start sensing the conclusion of every scene as it opens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary rules of movie geography . <P> The actors just seem to turn up when they 're needed for a scene , then equally illogically disappear until they 're required again . More improbable still , they find military equipment from our own era that is entirely functional after a millennium of neglect . Not since the inglorious days of the old Hollywood 's B pictures has one seen such totally grab-ass writing and direction . Maybe this is inherent in the underlying material , a novel by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard , which Travolta , a sect adherent , insists carries no religious message . Sounds right . If Scientology were this stupidly organized it would have no members . <P>  --  R.S.
