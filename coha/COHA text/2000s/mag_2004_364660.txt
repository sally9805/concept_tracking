No one owns just one Morrissey album . That would make as much sense as having one Grateful Dead tape or a single Proust volume . Either you 've got them all or you go out of your way to avoid socializing with people who do . The issue , of course , is n't with the art but with the cult . In Morrissey 's case , his acolytes long ago beatified him as the fragile saint of adolescent misery . " A lot of my fans have this perennial mental image of me being anemic and falling helplessly down the stairs , " says Morrissey . " I 'm not actually like that at all . They keep such ideas alive for their own sake . " <P> The latest opportunity for the uninitiated to dip a toe into the Morrissey universe arrived last week , when he released his first album in seven years , the ( moderately ) optimistic You Are the Quarry . But Morrissey knows that it will probably be the same group of hard-core wallowers crowding the register at record stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because being Mr. Misery is a pretty good gig . ( Quarry will probably enter in the Top 10 , and his most recent solo tour sold out in  --  no joke  --  5 min . ) He also knows he has done plenty to earn the title . As lead singer of the legendary ' 80s band the Smiths , Morrissey was quite possibly the unhappiest person in the world . What bonded him to his audience forever  --  and made him a prototype for Kurt Cobain  --  was his willingness to share . " There 's no line between me and my material , " says Morrissey . " If you claim to be a true pop artist , then you are one 24 hours a day , and your darker moments have to be documented as much as the cheery ones . And even years of despondency need to be documented . " <P> Morrissey had entire decades of despondency . The precise nature of his depression can be divined from his back catalog , which still sells briskly and is full of hopelessness ( Heaven Knows I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glove ) and rage at the hypocrisy of authority figures ( Margaret on the Guillotine ) . At 45 , Morrissey  --  his seldom used first name is Steven  --  has not changed his character ; he remains sensitive and defiant , with a lacerating wit . But he has changed his life . In 1998 he left his native England for Los Angeles , where he lives in a house built for Clark Gable . He volunteers for animal-rights charities . He goes out . He has friends . " I 'm in a better place , and I feel more resolute and stronger , " he says . " It 's not easy . You just do n't sit back and wait for this to happen . " <P> The only thing missing until recently was music . Although Morrissey 's solo albums sold well and he easily filled arenas , he was dropped from his record label in 1997 and spent years looking for a new deal , fighting perceptions that he was petulant and that his audience had aged beyond its intense interest in his every thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Linkin Park , which have cited Morrissey as an influence , and the flood of Morrissey shrines on the Internet were enough to persuade the Sanctuary Records Group to give him a shot . " I never stopped writing , " he says . " To be honest , I have n't stopped since I was 8 years old , and I can see you rolling your eyes , but it 's true . "
