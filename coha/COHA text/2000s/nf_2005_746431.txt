AMERICANS are working . But how many of them ? The answer to that question can have profound political consequences . Employment was a big issue in the 2004 presidential campaign , as George W. Bush and John Kerry sparred over how many jobs had been created or lost , and how to create more , and better . Jobs in the future . <p> Yet as the contenders traded barbs over outsourcing and tax increases , hardly anyone except for a handful of economists paid much attention to trying to answer the most basic question of all  --  how many Americans are working right now ? It sounds like a simple question , and there are certainly many possible answers floating around in the media , such as payroll statistics or the unemployment rate . But measuring employment and unemployment turns out to be a ticklish business , and only becomes more so once the experts turn their attention from statistical questions of samples and methods and start seeking explanations for the numbers they have counted . <p> So perhaps it should n't be surprising that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomplete . There is one statistic in particular that fueled the economic pessimism that marked the presidential campaign  --  total non-farm employment as measured by the government 's payroll survey . But cracks have been appearing in this statistic 's facade . The method used to produce the number has not kept pace with the rapidly changing American economy . It is high time to reconsider the faith politicians and policy makers place in current payroll data . Yesterday 's methods in today 's labor market <p> Employment is measured by the government 's Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) , a division of the Department of Labor . The BLS produces two different numbers intended to paint a picture of the overall labor market  --  the payroll survey and the household survey . The payroll survey yields data on the actual number of jobs gained and lost in the survey period ( which is one month for both numbers ) . The household survey produces an unemployment rate that captures the percentage of the labor force that is out of work , as well as an overall employment estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the payroll and household numbers are produced in very different ways . The payroll survey has a larger sample size , and tabulates roughly 400,000 employer records ( although usually only about half of the surveyed employers return the questionnaire in time to be tallied in the preliminary release on the first Friday of every force  --  is one of the payroll survey 's assets . And yet this vast sample lulls economists into a false sense of confidence about payroll sample quality . <p> For starters , job growth estimates in the payroll survey have a potential margin of error of 200,000 . Over 15 percent of preliminary payroll job growth estimates  --  the ones that garner the most media attention and are most quickly available to policy makers  --  are incorrect . This is partly a result of employer foot-dragging , but is significantly tied to a second , even more significant , structural limitation of the survey itself . <p> The payroll survey only measures traditional jobs , where a worker is hired onto a formal payroll . The survey involves an indirect sample of employment records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to measure employment in the age of " organization man , " when the labor market was more rigid , most people who worked did so full time , and people tended to stay at one job for a long time . But payrolls are not so adept at measuring employment in today 's labor force of flexible moms , part-time students , and early retirees . Consultants are not counted , nor are the self-employed , nor many partners in the new breed of limited liability corporation ( LLC ) , nor real estate agents . So , for example , the rise of working parents who are flexibly or marginally attached to the labor force is largely missed by the payroll method of measuring employment . <p> There is yet a third quirk of the payroll survey that is worth noting : It asks employers how many people have been on the payroll at any time during the survey period , which can lead to double-counting . Consider a worker who quits her job at the end of the second week of January to start in a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the questionnaire submitted by her former employer , since she was on the payroll for at least part of the survey period . She will also be counted by her new employer , for the same reason . Considering that , on average , up to 3 percent of workers changed jobs every month during the late 1990s , it is easy to see how this methodological flaw can significantly skew perceptions of the size of the job market . In a work force of 130 million people , roughly four million people were being counted on two payrolls per month due to turnover . In general , the payroll survey will overstate employment during times of high job turnover in the labor market , making employment seem smaller by comparison during periods of relative stability . <p> The household survey offers a marked contrast . It is based on personal contact with 60,000 individuals , and provides demographic details by gender , education , and race . By interviewing respondents , it seeks to differentiate between people who are " in " and " out " of the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people in the labor force who are unable to find work . <p> Household data have their own set of problems , and controversies have flared up periodically over the mechanics of the survey  --  when phone calls are made , and to whom , for example  --  as well as over more fundamental issues . But it seems fair to say that these biases have been largely static over much of the life of the survey . The methodology of the payroll survey , by contrast , is unable to compensate for a new economy in which people have a plethora of employment options . A tale of two ( and more ) surveys <p> The evidence that something is amiss in the payroll data lies in a phenomenon that astute economists have noticed in recent years : The payroll and household surveys have been diverging widely in the views they present of the American labor market . <p> The payroll survey indicated that 800,000 jobs were lost between President Bush 's inauguration and the 2004 election . At its low point , 2.7 million jobs had been lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 2003 , payrolls expanded every month leading up to the election , adding 1.9 million jobs in just over one year  --  a strong showing , but not enough to create net job gains . The sluggish recovery of payrolls fueled the media 's " jobless recovery " story line in 2003 , and allowed candidate Kerry to call Bush 's the worst presidential record on jobs since Herbert Hoover . <p> And yet , this labor market crisis only seemed to be appearing in the payroll survey data . Other official government measures signaled net job growth during the first Bush term , especially the household survey , which indicated that the number of American workers grew by 1.6 million under Bush . Other labor data confirm the positive view : Initial jobless claims were 10 percent below their historical average during 2004 , and private-sector hiring indexes were setting records . As Andrew Sum , Paul Harrington , and Ishwar Khatiwada put it in a November 2003 paper for the Center of Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University , <p> Total employment in the U.S. has increased much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by findings of the Current Employment Statistics payroll survey .. Since most of these sources of employment gains have occurred outside the formal employment system , total hours of labor input in the U.S. economy are likely being underestimated , thus exaggerating part of the rise in labor productivity since the end of the recession . <p> If all the other indicators suggest that the labor market is keeping up with other signs of economic improvement , where did all those " lost jobs " go ? The most obvious answer is that they did n't go anywhere . Or to be more precise , more workers stayed put in their current jobs , thus depriving the payroll survey an opportunity to double count them . <p> Aggregate data from the Census Bureau show that job-changing from one employer to another , which had averaged 3 percent per month in the 1990s , declined by about 0.2 percentage points per year after 2001 , settling at 2.4 percent in 2003 , where it remains today . This seemingly small change meant that during the campaign season , roughly one million fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that roughly one million fewer workers were being double counted on payrolls , a statistical change that the payroll survey registered as one million " lost " jobs . <p> Given the obvious flaw in the payroll methodology , the only curious thing is that this effect was not quantified this neatly before 2004 . The BLS had noticed the divergence between the payroll and household surveys , and had even started publishing a " reconciliation " each month in an effort to explain the gap . But when it began issuing this report , the bureau initially neglected to mention job-changing as one of the possible causes . Only in August 2004 , after pressure from outside economists , did the BLS issue a paper discussing the issue . This despite ample anecdotal evidence that the economy was experiencing decreased turnover . <p> Not only that , but the BLS itself produced a new data set that , in hindsight , clearly points to a sharp drop-off in turnover after September 11 . In 2003 , the bureau launched a new quarterly report intended to go beyond the static snapshot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internal dynamics of employment . The report , called " Business Employment Dynamics " ( BED ) , measures the gross flows of new jobs created and new job losses every quarter , and has been calculated as far back as 1992 . This study provides a stark image of the slowdown in turnover after 2001 . <p> A measure of gross job flows can be instructive because , it provides a clue to the degree to which the demand side in the labor market  --  the employer  --  is providing opportunities for the " churn " that causes turnover and the resulting double counting on the payroll survey . BED demonstrates that 8.2 percent of all jobs were created anew each quarter in the 1990s , while roughly 7.5 percent were destroyed . In other words , in any given month 7.5 percent of American jobs would be lost , while a number equal to 8 percent would be created . So the net job creation ( jobs created minus jobs destroyed ) might have appeared modest , but it was masking a much greater amount of movement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exacerbate the payroll survey 's double-counting problem . The rate of job gain started to drop in 2000 , then rebounded in the second half of 2001 before dropping again throughout 2002 and 2003 , when it settled at 7 percent . Yet while the rate of job losses spiked during the 2001 recession , reaching 8.4 percent in the third quarter of that year , it dropped after the September 11 attacks . The job loss rate remained lower in the second half of 2003 than at any other time in the previous decade . In other words , the labor market is in a period of relative stability , with a much smaller amount of churn than was seen in the 1990s , and thus much less potential for payroll double counting . This provides a demand-side explanation for the divergence between the payroll and household surveys . <p> What do all these percentages mean in terms of real numbers of jobs ? In August 2004 , in the same paper in which the BLS admitted that payroll double counting was a problem , it released a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methodological flaw . To give just one example , in March 2001 the BLS had estimated the total number of jobs to be 132.51 million . But after subtracting its estimate of double-counted job-changers , the BLS now says the true figure was 130.85 million . <p> The change does not represent nearly two million jobs that we now know were lost . Rather , it signifies the purging from the record of nearly two million jobs that never existed to begin with , that appeared only as the result of a statistical fluke . And there may be more such " phantoms . " It is worth noting that these phantoms are still included in official payroll employment estimates every month . Even though its acknowledgment of sample problems is a vital first step , the BLS still uses overly cautious assumptions when trying to correct the error , presuming that only a fraction of job-changers are double counted . <p> Companies track their payrolls on several schedules , the most common options being monthly , biweekly , or weekly . Therefore , on the payroll survey questionnaire the BLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on the payroll during the company 's reference period . For monthly , or even biweekly , tallies it is easy to see how double-counting would occur  --  so easy to see that even the BLS is now conceding the point . But the bureau still holds that a worker who leaves a weekly payroll job for another weekly one can not be counted twice . This neglects the use of " terminal leave , " when an employee overlaps two paychecks . Such real-world complications are likely to amplify the turnover effect . <p> This statistical evidence is made all the more compelling by the existence of an obvious theoretical explanation for the sudden , and recent , drop in turnover : terrorism . On reflection , it is hard to imagine that the September 11 attacks are not the main rationale driving lower job turn over . In the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon , conventional wisdom held that Americans would re-orient their priorities toward family and away from work , and seek security wherever they could find it . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , and act accordingly . " Cocooning " is the phrase market researchers coined to describes this tendency for families to stay closer to home for dining , entertaining , and working , and all these trends were developing before September 11 , but accelerated after the attacks . The hospitality industry can certainly attest to this , having witnessed a precipitous decline in leisure ( and even business ) travel in the wake of September 11 . It does not take a great leap of imagination to suppose that the impact of terrorism concerns would extend from questions of where to vacation into questions of whether or not to change jobs . If the overall trend has been for people to display more risk aversion , we should not be surprised that they are not changing jobs as frequently as they did in the go-go 1990s , thus preventing the BLS from over-counting them in the payroll survey . The mythical discouraged worker <p> All of these theoretical and practical problems with the payroll survey are convincing a growing number of economists that the survey needs revision . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments unpersuasive . These academics and pundits allow that there is an unusual divergence between the results of the payroll and household surveys , and that this divergence is serious enough that it warrants reevaluating one of the surveys . <p> However , they take aim at the household survey . While they offer several interesting arguments , two key points surface most often in the media . First , these critics contend that the way the survey defines " unemployment " systematically undercounts people whom any non-economist would recognize as unemployed . Second , they argue that , again thanks to the survey 's definition of the " labor force , " it is possible for a negative trend in the economy to appear as a positive trend in the unemployment rate . Both of these are long-standing charges against the household survey , and both have some theoretical merit . But a look at empirical results shows that neither of these forces is at work in the current economy . At the end of the day , a flaw with the payroll survey is the only satisfactory explanation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's rosy unemployment figures actually conceal bad economic news might seem counterintuitive . The unemployment rate today is lower than the average of the 1990s . Most people remember that decade as a pretty good time , economically , but the unemployment rate averaged 5.76 percent . By comparison , after a recession and all the economic uncertainty created by the September 11 attacks , the unemployment rate peaked at only 6.3 percent in June 2003 before starting to decline , settling at 5.4 percent in October 2004 , one month before the election . Liberals hoping to use economic malaise to unseat President Bush needed an explanation . One obvious option was to ridicule the household survey . They would start with the way the survey calculates the unemployment rate  --  dividing the number of jobless by the total number of people in the labor force  --  and would attack the way the survey defines the labor force  --  counting only those with jobs or those who have actively sought employment in the 30 days leading up to the survey date . <p> New York Times columnist Paul Krugman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 , 2003 , that would become the Democratic mantra : <p> The measured unemployment rate of 5.9 percent is n't that high by historical standards , but there 's something funny about that number . An unusually large number of people have given up looking for work , so they are no longer counted as unemployed , and many of those who say they have jobs seem to be only marginally employed . <p> In other words , the economy had deteriorated so much that a lot of people were not even trying to work anymore . In this view , there were a lot of " discouraged workers " whom a normal person would consider unemployed , but whom an economist would not count as part of the labor force when measuring the unemployment rate . The theme was amplified by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute ( EPI ) in March 2004 . In a press release that month , the EPI asserted that " persistently weak job growth " was leading to " labor force contraction . " <p> The problem with the critique offered by Krugman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported empirically . The BLS itself has been collecting data on the number of discouraged workers since 1994 , and even includes this group in calculating its alternative " underemployment rate . " This statistic , known as " U-4 , " has followed the same trend as the traditional unemployment rate , suggesting that an increase in underemployment has not been fueling the decrease in full-blown unemployment . On the contrary , BLS data show that there were fewer discouraged workers as a percentage of the labor force in 2004 than in 1994 . The labor force ( the denominator in the unemployment rate ) grew by 200,000 the same month that the EPI issued its press release , having grown by 1.2 million over the year leading up to EPI 's announcement . Between the 2000 and 2004 elections the labor force grew by four million people . Given that the denominator was increasing at this pace , it is a simple mathematical fact that the only way the unemployment rate could have stayed as low as it did through the recession and the aftermath of terrorism was if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The second line of attack on the household survey claims that even if the absolute size of the labor force was increasing , it was not keeping pace with population growth . The labor , force participation rate ( the percentage of all working-age people who are defined as being in the labor force ) declined slightly during the recession , from a peak of 67.2 percent in January 2001 to 66.8 percent in October 2001 , and has hovered at 66 percent for most of the past three years . <p> But again , a closer look at the demographic breakdown of labor force participation statistics reveals a simple explanation : Fewer teenagers are working . The decline in total participation rates since 2001 is largely driven by the unprecedented dropoff in teenagers aged between 16 and 19 , from 52 percent in 2000 to 44 percent in 2004 . One way to put this in perspective is to look at the gap between the participation rate of all civilians versus the rate for teens . This gap averaged 10.8 percentage points between 1950 and 2000 , before climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 . <p> The decline in teen participation is a surprising puzzle , given that conventional theory holds that the improvement in the overall unemployment rate should lead to a steeper jump in the number of teens willing to work . But , as troubling as it is for theorists , is the decline really bad news on its own ? Clearly , the teenagers of 2004 are generally not heads of households , and they have certainly not lost jobs and become discouraged . Rather , these are young adults who chose not to enter the labor force in the first place , or were restricted from doing so by their parents . <p> Whether or not the dropoff is bad news for teens , it is bad news for proponents of the discouraged worker hypothesis who intend to create doubts about the integrity of the household survey . In the end , the household survey provides clarity on the labor force , clarity on discouraged workers , and clarity on demographic trends that are not available elsewhere . <p> None of this is to say that the household survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations and uncertainty . That is not the question . The question is , which survey has a methodological flaw that explains the divergence of measures of total employment growth over the past three years ? The limitations of the household survey proposed by critics are either non-existent or well-known and irrelevant to the question at hand . Although it is possible some new flaws will be discovered in the household survey , odds are that a different set of economic factors explains the household-payroll divergence . A survey under duress <p> Deep cracks are starting to show in the current payroll survey methodology . It has fallen seriously out of synch with the other major measure of American employment , the household survey . Empirical evidence suggests that the household survey is currently the more reliable picture of how many Americans are actually working . And this empirical evidence is backed up by a theory that easily accounts for the available statistical findings by positing a serious flaw in the payroll survey 's method , a flaw so serious that even the survey 's " parent , " the BLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the BLS is still understating the scale ) . <p> Perhaps the biggest problem with the payroll survey , though , is that even as economists find more and more evidence that it is unreliable , policy makers , politicians , and the public continue to take it so seriously . Even luminaries such as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan have defended the payroll survey . ( Greenspan did so in early 2003 , as the divergence between household and payroll , surveys first came to light ; his argument rested mainly on the larger sample size . ) In the just-concluded presidential campaign , bombast about the million or more jobs " lost " in the Bush administration was a standard part of the stump speech of Democratic nominee John Kerry and running mate John Edwards . <p> Fortunately , in this election voters seem to have looked beyond this faulty statistic , making their decision to reelect Bush based on other factors . But the economy will certainly dominate campaigns in the future , and will consume the attention of policy makers in perpetuity . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more accurate picture of the economy and which do not . The payroll survey in its current form does not pass that test . <p> By Tim Kane <p>
