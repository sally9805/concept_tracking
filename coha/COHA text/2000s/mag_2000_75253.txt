Royal Runaround Last season Kansas City 's unheralded outfield of Carlos Beltran , Johnny Damon and Jermaine Dye combined to drive in more runs than any other outfield trio in the major leagues , including the star-laden threesomes below . // TEAM // OUTFIELD // RBIS // Royals // Carlos Beltran , Johnny Damon , Jermaine Dye // 298 // Orioles // Brady Anderson , Albert Belle , B.J. Surhoff // 282 // Rockies // Dante Bichette , Darryl Hamilton , Larry Walker // 265 // Braves // Andruw Jones , Brian Jordan , Gerald Williams // 264 // Indians // David Justice , Kenny Lofton , Manny Ramirez // 264 // SOURCE : ELIAS SPORTS BUREAU // He came to Kansas City four years ago , a naive , raw rookie with a ton of enthusiasm and a dream . Dammit ! Mike Levy told himself , I 'm going to be the best vice president of marketing and communications around ! So what if Levy knew absolutely nothing of his new team , the poor , punchless Royals ? Levy may have been green , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Johnny Damon , " he purrs . " Just say it  --  Johnny Damon . It sounds like a guy in a leather jacket , riding a Harley . A hero 's name . " // In the world of p.r. , who could ask for anything more than a player with a cool moniker and a warm smile ? Within days Levy arranged a TV promo for the team , starring the then 22-year-old Damon and retired K.C. star George Brett , in which the two sit in front of a TV , each holding a remote control . Brett switches the channel to his preference ; Damon switches the channel to his . " Gim me that ! " Brett finally yells , swiping the remote from Damon 's left hand . As the spot ends , Brett turns to Damon and flashes his 1985 World Series ring . " You 've got to win one of these first . " // During the 1996 season , his first full one in the majors , Damon was asked time and again to compare himself with Brett , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point at which Kansas City executives all but ordered reporters to stop . " Really , I thought it was a good idea at the time , " Levy says of his marketing ploy . " There just was n't a lot to say about Royals baseball . " // Deep in the heart of baseball nowhere  --  in the land of $25 million payrolls and Buddy Biancalana vigils  --  resides a trio of young ( average age : 25 ) outfielders who are fast , powerful , graceful , personable and obscure . " I hear some people talk about the best young outfield , " says Kansas City lefthander Jose Rosado . " Johnny Damon , Carlos Beltran and Jermaine Dye are awesome . They are n't the best young outfield . They 're the best outfield. " // Last season , as the youthful Royals went 64-97 , leftfielder Damon , centerfielder Beltran and rightfielder Dye combined to lead all major league outfield trios with 546 hits , 108 doubles , 24 triples , 298 RBIs and 41 assists , while ranking second in runs , with 304 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning an encouraging five of eight games , Dye picked up where he 'd left off , hitting .419 with five doubles , three homers and seven runs batted in . Beltran had a homer , seven RBIs and a .265 average . Damon , the leadoff hitter , batted only .222 , but on Monday his ninth-inning solo homer off Minnesota Twins righty reliever LaTroy Hawkins gave the Royals a 6-5 win . // Damon and Beltran are products of the Kansas City farm system , drafted in 1992 and ' 95 , respectively ; each has classic good looks , a quick smile and a flashy , almost cocky , on-field demeanor . When Damon was called up from the Double A Wichita Wranglers in August ' 95 and began exhibiting his headfirst slides , diving catches and penchant for hitting triples ( he has 37 in five years ) , he became a fan favorite and , like it or not , a potential successor to Brett as Mr. Royal . He still does n't like the comparison  --  " I 'm no George Brett , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure has n't bothered him since ' 92 , when , as a senior at Orlando 's Dr. Phillips High , he was regularly introduced before games as " the nation 's Number 1 player on the nation 's Number 1 team .... " // " Can you get any more pressure than that ? " says Damon . " Probably not . " // Despite back-to-back seasons in which he averaged 103 runs , 179 hits , 35 doubles , 10 triples , 16 home runs and 31 stolen bases  --  numbers that make him one of the best leadoff hitters in baseball  --  Damon is unheralded outside of Kansas City and Orlando . His teammates are appreciative ( Royals righthander Jeff Suppan pumped his fist in salute last Saturday after Damon robbbed Minnesota 's Todd Walker with a sliding catch ) , and he 's paid a team-high $4 million , but that 's relatively paltry by big league standards . That 's why several teams  --  including the New York Mets and the New York Yankees  --  have approached K.C. about acquiring Damon . " There are clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have Johnny , because he 's the one piece that a club thinks can cement the playoffs or World Series , " says Royals general manager Herk Robinson . So is he available ? " No way , " says Robinson . " He 's just too important here . " // The same can be said for Beltran , the 1999 American League Rookie of the Year . Three years ago , while with the Class A Wilmington Blue Rocks , Beltran batted .229 , but that was partly because  --  out of the blue  --  he had decided to become a switch-hitter . " I knew I would be terrible , " says Beltran , who was a natural righthanded hitter . " I also knew switch-hitting would not just help me reach the majors but also make me an every-day player . " The following year Beltran batted .276 for Wilmington and then , after a promotion , .352 for Wichita . Last spring Royals manager Tony Muser kept Beltran on the Opening Day roster for his defense and got offense . Beltran hit .293 with 112 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first rookie to clear both 100 runs and 100 RBIs since the Boston Red Sox ' Fred Lynn in ' 75 . This year Beltran 's outfield play is receiving added respect , as evidenced in Sunday 's 13-7 Minnesota victory by the way Twins coach Ron Gardenhire held base runner Torii Hunter at third on a Cristian Guzman single rather than test Beltran 's arm . " I 've said this all along , " says Damon . " Carlos is the most gifted baseball player I 've ever seen . " // Folks have never uttered such words about Dye , although when he arrived on the campus of Cosumnes River ( Calif . ) Community College as a freshman in 1992 , coach Rod Beilby thought Dye had a potentially dominant arm . After all , Dye , a pitcher out of Will C. Wood High in Vacaville , Calif. , had been drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 47th round . ( He did n't sign . ) " I remember his first game for me . He threw the ball up , down , wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , ' This guy 's an outfielder. ' " // His slingshot arm  --  Dye led his minor league in assists in 1994 and ' 95 , with 22 each season  --  was a big reason the Atlanta Braves called him up in ' 96 as a replacement for the injured David Justice . Dye wound up hitting 12 homers in 98 games and started in the World Series . But the following spring the Braves traded him to Kansas City , beginning a downward spiral in his career . Dye was on the disabled list four times in two years , including a season-ending stint in ' 98 after he tore cartilage in his right knee while stepping into his Lexus in a Wal-Mart parking lot . // Shortly thereafter Dye was hunting in the woods outside Kansas City when he tripped and fell into a bush of thorns , opening a gash on his right cheek . Two thick scars remain . " I 've had a lot of little problems , " says Dye , " but frustration does nobody any good . I knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , in his first full year in the majors , he batted .294 with 44 doubles ( tied for second in the American League ) , 27 home runs , 119 RBIs and 17 assists ( a single-season Royals record that tied him for the league lead ) . " Jermaine puts up superstar stats , " says third baseman Joe Randa , " but he 's not the kind of guy to beg for attention . " // Memo to Mike Levy : Get on this .
