Jackie Flynn just turned eleven , but he has already spent plenty of time inside the Knickerbocker , a dark smoky barroom where men with rulers in their back pockets drink beer and stare at a soundless TV . Whenever his father goes out to do what he calls " moonlighting , " Jackie 's mother insists that Jackie accompany him . She tells Jackie to keep his father out of trouble , and although he 's not sure exactly what she 's talking about , Jackie always nods his head . When he was little , he simply watched his father work , but soon Jackie was fetching tools and measuring pipe and following his father into the bar when the work was done . By now Jackie knows the name of every song on the bullet-shaped jukebox ; he knows that the extra can of sawdust for shuffleboard is stored high on a shelf in the rank-smelling men 's room . He has hit the cue ball across the empty pool table often enough to memorize every imperfection in the faded green felt . <p> Jackie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he always occupies the same wobbly Formica table , where he drinks Cokes and studies the men as they toss crumpled bills on the bar to claim their territory . The Knickerbocker is not a safe place . At least once a month , Jackie 's father has a fight . Frank Flynn is fearless , and Jackie longs to be like that , to act without thinking . He wants to know what these men know , but they conspire against him ; no one ever lets him follow the crowd outside to watch the fight . Jackie 's father always comes back first , and although he 's winded and wild-looking , a band of disciples slap his back and buy him drinks . Jackie never knows what caused the fight , but he recognizes victory . He 's always too far away to hear anything , so he waits and watches , memorizing poses and gestures , and he dreams of the day he will take his place at the bar . <p> Tonight , Jackie is helping his father fix a leaky drain pipe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the bar . The owner of the Knickerbocker , Marty Sullivan , a powerful yet genial man with thinning red hair , stands on a raised floor of thin wooden slats that bend and squeak when he takes a step . Jackie 's father hands Jackie a wrench and tells him to unscrew the sink trap . Behind him , on slick mahogany shelves , stand rows of gleaming bottles , each of which , Jackie is certain , is filled with a magical liquid that must be sweeter than he can imagine . He 's so thrilled to be helping his father that he does n't even bother to sweep aside the layers of dust and crumpled pretzels before he shimmies under the sink and wedges the jaws of the battered wrench around a rusty slipnut . Once the sink is disconnected , Jackie follows his father to the basement , where rows of beer kegs line one wall . Frank Flynn balances on top of the kegs and struggles to separate two filthy pipes . Jackie stands below him , aiming a flashlight upward , stomping his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Will you hold the goddamn light steady , " Frank shouts down . " I ca n't see what the hell I 'm doing up here . " <p> Jackie refocuses the beam toward the ceiling through a haze of dust and leans against a steel column ; he wonders if it 's true that liquor makes you feel no pain . <p> Frank grunts as he wrestles a mutilated pipe from behind an oak beam , then tosses it to the floor , where it clanks against the concrete . Blue and yellow sparks are flying . <p> " I thought that sucker was never going to come apart . " Frank jumps down and fishes a cigarette out of his shirt pocket . He strikes a match repeatedly , but it wo n't light . " Do me a favor , will you ? " Frank hands the matchbook to Jackie . " My hands are wet . " Jackie tugs off a match and lights it . As he holds the match out , Frank sticks his chin forward and cups his hands around the flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dad ? " Jackie asks . " What 's a good reason to fight somebody ? " <p> His father raises his eyebrows to look at Jackie and blows out the match . Then he takes a long puff and grins . <p> " Somebody giving you trouble ? A big kid ? " <p> Jackie is too embarrassed to admit that he has no idea what to do if another kid were to threaten him . He has never been in a fight , has never felt the desire to hurt anyone . He does n't know whether this is simply because he has no enemies , or if he is a coward . <p> " Let me show you something . " Frank stands closer and puts his hands on Jackie 's shoulders . " If you 're fighting with somebody bigger than you , get in close . " Frank crouches down and raises his fists in front of his face ; he moves in even closer to Jackie and begins to jab . His dark hair hangs across his forehead , shading his blue eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to touch you . Work on the stomach and always keep your hands up . " <p> Frank is ducking and weaving as he swings . Jackie takes a step back . " You 've got to keep your hands up , " Frank repeats , swiping at Jackie 's face . Jackie retreats farther , slipping behind the column . " Come on . Where are you going ? " Frank tosses his cigarette on the floor . " I 'm trying to teach you something here . " <p> " But that 's not what I mean , " Jackie says , a little louder than he intends . " I mean , when is it the right time to fight ? " <p> His father tilts his head and stares , bewildered . " That 's what I 'm trying to show you , " he insists . " Get in there and hit him . " A rust-coated fist darts past Jackie 's ear , and he ca n't help flinching . " Never give anyone a chance to think . " <p> After they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register and slips Jackie a soggy five-dollar bill . " You do good work . " Marty pats him on the back . Then , as Frank comes up from the basement , Marty leans closer . " Do n't tell your old man . He 'll think he 's not charging me enough . " <p> Jackie nods , then squats down and begins to pick up the tools that are scattered on the floor . While Marty settles up with Frank , Jackie spies two half-filled shot glasses among the dirty mugs . He hesitates only slightly before he grabs the closest glass and gulps it as fast as he can . His throat is sizzling , and he breaks into a coughing fit he ca n't control . Marty and Frank gaze over , concerned . <p> " I 'm fine , " Jackie assures them . " Dust . " Jackie figures he must have chosen the wrong glass . He is convinced the other one will taste like maple syrup . The moment the men turn away , Jackie snatches the second glass . He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing like syrup , but he downs it , anyway . This time he manages to keep from coughing , but his insides are searing . As he squeezes past Marty and Frank , he 's sure his face is red ; his ears feel so hot they must be glowing . He ducks under the gate at the end of the bar and lugs the toolbox out to the parking lot . <p> In the glove compartment of his father 's old Ford , Jackie finds a piece of Wrigley 's Spearmint and unwraps it . He flips on the overhead light to check the time on the dashboard clock . Eleven fortyfive . The only way he ever gets to stay up this late is when his father has a job to do . If he 'd been home tonight , he 'd have been in bed for two and a half hours already . He climbs out of the car and surveys the sky . There is a full moon on the horizon which turns the air a deep blue . Jackie tries to find the Little Dipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He settles against the car , and without knowing why , he lets out a hoot . He 's sure it takes more than two drinks to get drunk , but something is different inside him . He feels older . More daring . He turns and studies the Knickerbocker . Smoky-blue neon signs flicker behind the plate-glass windows ; streetlights tint the white clapboards a powdery yellow . He studies his reflection in the car window , then heads back inside to claim his table by the jukebox . <p> Jackie 's father is still at the bar , along with Bill Laskowski , whose wife is always wearing her nurse 's uniform when she comes to drag him home . Stan Gordon , the owner of Stan 's Hardware , is playing pool with Sharkey Davis , who never smiles and is unable to hold any job for more than a week , but who is currently working for Stan at the hardware store , mixing paint and making keys . <p> Stan howls like a dog as Sharkey sinks the eight ball . Then he slams his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five dollars . <p> Sharkey throws up his hands . " Next victim ? " he says , scanning the bar . <p> Nobody answers him , and then he spies Jackie . " How about you , kid ? Got any money ? " <p> Jackie hesitates long enough to look to his father for some sort of sign . He interprets Frank Flynn 's casual shrug as permission and pulls out his five-dollar bill . <p> Sharkey looks to Jackie 's father . " This kid a hustler , Frank ? " <p> " There 's one way to find out . " <p> Jackie grabs a cue from a pine hutch and rubs blue chalk on the tip while Sharkey starts racking up the balls . <p> The men are all watching as Jackie settles his left wrist on the felt and takes his stance . Until now , he 's only hit the cue ball around the empty table , but he 's watched the men play , he knows what to do . He pulls the stick back slowly and lets it fly . Striped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls into a pocket . <p> It 's after midnight when Sharkey is down to the eight ball , his final shot , while Jackie has n't managed to sink a single ball . Jackie figures he keeps missing because it 's so late , because he 's tired ; everything seems hazy , and the cue ball refuses to go where he aims it . As he focuses across the table , Sharkey moves next to him and leans in close . <p> " Do n't blow it , " Sharkey says . " There 's a lot of green in between . " <p> " Come on , Sharkey , " Stan calls from the bar . " Let the kid shoot . " <p> " We 're not at work now , Stanley . So mind your own fucking business . I 'm only giving the kid some advice . It does n't bother him . Does it , kid ? " <p> " Does n't bother me , " Jackie insists , although his mouth is as dry as dirt and his insides feel knotted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three inches . <p> Sharkey effortlessly sinks the eight , then winces as the cue ball drops in as well . <p> " Scratch on the eight ! " Stan Gordon clutches his throat as though he 's being strangled . " Choked under the pressure . " <p> Sharkey tosses five one-dollar bills on the table , then heads into the men 's room . <p> " Go ahead , pick it up . You won , the money 's yours . " Stan raises his glass in a toast , and even though he knows that his victory was nothing more than luck , Jackie ca n't keep from grinning . <p> Marty fills a beer mug with Coke and waves Jackie over . <p> " Here you go , " he says to Jackie , holding the mug high . " You can sit up here . " Marty slaps the chrome stool next to Frank Flynn . <p> It does not matter that Jackie 's feet dangle limply when he spins around on the stool ; he grabs a handful of pretzels from a rough wooden bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asks his father , tipping his head toward the pool table . <p> " Do n't go getting all high and mighty now , " Frank Flynn says . " You were lucky is all . " <p> Before Jackie can decide whether his father is teasing or not , the men 's room door swings open , then slams shut with a series of slaps . Sharkey Davis fumbles with his fly for a moment and heads for the far end of the bar , next to Stan . " Where 's my drink ? " he demands . <p> Marty pours him a shot , but when he reaches for one of the bills on the bar , Sharkey puts one hand over the money ; he glares at Jackie . " The winner usually buys the next round . " <p> Jackie stops spinning , embarrassed by not knowing all the rules . As he quickly reaches into his pants pocket , his stomach refuses to stop turning . <p> " You keep your money , kid , " Stan Gordon says . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see somebody beat Sharkey . " <p> Before Marty can take Stan 's money , Sharkey is I lost . There 's a difference . " <p> Frank Flynn pulls his expensive dentures out and slaps them on the bar , ready for anything , ready to jump right in , but before he gets off his stool , Marty vaults right over the bar and grabs Sharkey , locking his arms behind his back . " Come on , pal . You 've had enough for tonight . I think it 's time to head on home . " He steers Sharkey toward the door and kicks it open . Sharkey tries to wrestle free , but Marty 's holding tight . The two men go outside , and the door closes behind them . <p> Jackie watches through the glass as Marty lets Sharkey go . Sharkey seems to want to argue , but Marty turns and comes back inside . As he walks past , he pats Jackie on the back . " The guy 's an idiot , kid . Do n't pay attention to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the channel . Jackie 's father replaces his teeth , no fights tonight . The men sip their drinks and study the television sports announcer as if nothing happened . When Jackie looks back at the door , Sharkey is gone . Maybe nothing did happen . Maybe he imagined the whole thing . <p> Ten minutes later , the phone rings . As Marty picks it up , Frank Flynn signals and whispers , " I just left . " Jackie has heard this plenty of times before , has enjoyed the bond that sharing this secret lie with his father gives him . But this time it 's not Jackie 's mother . <p> Marty hangs up and announces that Sharkey 's wife says he just grabbed a carving knife ; he 's on his way back . <p> Marty goes to the front door . He snaps the lock and turns off the lights . " He must really have a load on . Everybody just sit tight . He 'll figure we 're closed and give up . " <p> Frank Flynn gives Jackie a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " It 's getting late , and I 'm not about to sit around hiding in the dark . Let 's get going . " <p> " But he 's coming back with a knife . Did n't you hear ? " <p> " He 's got no beef with me . " <p> " You sure you do n't want to just stay here until it blows over ? " Marty asks , but he 's already slipping the key into the lock . Everybody knows that if there is anyone more stubborn than Sharkey , it 's Frank Flynn . <p> " He 's got a knife , " Jackie repeats . But Frank walks out into the night , and Jackie has no choice but to follow him . <p> Jackie sees the dull yellow dome light glowing inside the car and knows he is in serious trouble . Starting the car is always tentative , but he left the light on and the battery is sure to be dead . As his father tries to start the engine , Jackie can feel his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank finally gives up and opens his door . Jackie is ready to dash back into the safety of the bar . But his father is heading in the other direction , across the street , toward home . A car speeds past , and through the glare of headlights , Jackie spies Sharkey walking up the road . He hurries after his father ; he 's set to run , but once they cross the street , Frank stops by the woods that line the road . <p> Sharkey has reached the bar and is peering into the darkened windows . " Open up the goddamned door , " he shouts , rattling the glass . <p> " Let 's go , Dad , " Jackie pleads . They should be hurrying , but Frank is busy peeing into the bushes . <p> " I want to see what he does when he ca n't get in . " Frank pulls his zipper up and steps out , into the pool of a streetlight . What the men say about his father is right-no fear-but if this is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sharkey squints in the glare . " Who 's over there ? " <p> Frank Flynn steps onto the street . Jackie ca n't believe it . " Do n't , " Jackie pleads . " Let 's run . " <p> His father grins . " Relax . He 's not after me . I 'm just going to tell him to go home and sleep it off . " <p> The two men meet in the middle of the street , and Frank puts a hand on Sharkey 's shoulder . Sharkey pulls away , and the blade he 's carrying throws a white flash into the night . He swings the knife again , and Jackie 's father jumps back . <p> " Take it easy , Sharkey . You 've got the wrong guy here . You do n't want to fight me . " <p> " You 're not so tough , " Sharkey taunts , jabbing the knife out . <p> Frank swerves to his right , and the blade slashes across the front of his flannel shirt . " Shit , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting me for ? I thought you were mad at Stan . " <p> Sharkey shoots the knife out again . " Well , I ca n't find that chickenshit asshole . And you 're right here . " He swings the knife once more and catches Frank in the arm . <p> Frank does n't seem to notice the blood that splatters his work boots . He takes a step back . " Big man , " he says . " Pretty tough with a fucking knife in your hand . " <p> The men circle each other , moving from the center of the street to the curb . They are only ten feet away from Jackie when Frank turns both palms upward and beckons to Sharkey . " Come on , " he says , " drop the knife , and I 'll fight you like a man . " <p> Sharkey grins and tosses the knife behind him . It clangs against the blacktop and skids to a stop so close to Jackie he can make out nicks on the cutting edge . Jackie knows he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his feet will not move ; he needs time to think . Can he get the knife ? What if he does ? Because of a game of pool , because he left the car light on , this is happening . They would stop if he got the knife . They would see how ridiculous the whole thing is ; there 's nothing to fight about . While Jackie tries to will himself to move , Frank lurches forward , his right fist pulled back . Instantly , Sharkey whirls back and scoops up the knife . He swings in wide arcs . Anything could happen , except the thing that does . Frank shoots out both hands , grabs the blade of the knife , and yanks it from Sharkey . Frank hurls the knife behind him , then charges , catching Sharkey with a right that sends him sprawling . The moment Sharkey hits the ground , Frank jumps on top of him . He continues to throw punches long after Sharkey is unconscious , he kicks him in the head , again and again until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 's always wanted to see , Jackie does not study the way his father moves without deliberation . He does not examine the technique because he knows now he will never use it . <p> A police car pulls up , and two officers drag Jackie 's father off ; they 're about to arrest him when Marty appears and tells them they 've got the wrong guy . Frank 's hands are dripping blood , and his shirt hangs in thin ribbons across his chest . When one police officer sees the wounds , he calls to his partner , " We better get an ambulance . " <p> Frank looks down at his hands and seems surprised by the blood . " Shit , " he says . " I 'm not going to any hospital . Those damn doctors will keep me up all night , and I 've got work in the morning . " <p> While the police handcuff Sharkey and drag him to the squad car , Marty wraps Frank 's hands in a bar towel , then leads him back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and watches the men at the bar . Marty heads to the back room to hunt for some bandages . <p> " Some night , huh ? " he says to Jackie . " You okay , kid ? " <p> " Sure , " Jackie says . <p> " Come on over with us . " Marty nods toward the bar . " I 'll sneak you a little drink . It 'll calm your nerves . " <p> A circle of neon flickers in the window , that blue that always makes Jackie think of summer . " That 's okay , " he says . " I 'm not supposed to be there . " <p>
