DIED . JANET LEIGH , 77 , coolly seductive Hollywood star , who earned immortality as the cinema 's prime slasher victim in Hitchcock 's Psycho ; of vasculitis ; in Beverly Hills , Calif . She could have settled for being Tony Curtis ' wife ( for 11 years ) and Jamie Lee 's mother . But Leigh had a gaze as alert and sexy as any in movies . It bored into Frank Sinatra 's frazzled psyche in The Manchurian Candidate ; mixed fear and fire as a captive in Orson Welles ' Touch of Evil . Even after she 'd been killed in the Psycho shower ( a model doubled her in some shots ) , Leigh 's unblinking eye held the viewer 's . Decades later , it still does .  --  By Richard Corliss
