// The World Wakes Up to Climate Change There are 60,000 square feet of solar panels on San Francisco 's Moscone Convention Center , enough to power 675 houses , and all new municipal buildings in the city by the bay must comply with U.S. Green Building Council standards . In Portland , Oregon , transportation activists and the " Green Team " ( made up of city employee volunteers ) sponsor Car Free and Care Free ( CFCF ) weeks that encourage employees to get out of their cars by telecommuting or by using alternative transportation . In 2005 , 1,900 commuters took part , avoiding : 37,630 auto trips , 317,000 vehicle miles traveled and the emission of 317,974 pounds of the major global warming gas , carbon dioxide ( C02 ) . And in Buffalo , New York , General Motors ' Tonawanda Engine Plant has drastically reduced emissions and gone " landfill free , " a feat it achieved by reducing waste generation , recycling and converting waste to energy . Welcome to a new world , where the debate over the science of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combating it-with only a very limited window of opportunity-is only just beginning . We have to act quickly . According to new studies published last March in the respected journal Science , warming temperatures are likely to cause a catastrophic , long-term meltdown on the roof of the world in Greenland and in Antarctica . Scientists say we have a decade at most to reduce our emissions and avoid a nightmare scenario that would flood not only below-sea-level New Orleans , but also much of south Florida and the Outer Banks of North Carolina , as well as the California coast . The average global temperature , according to the international climate scientists banded together in the UN 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) will rise by three to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century . The public is only beginning to wake up to the reality of climate change . A record 57 percent of Americans , according to the most recent Gallup Poll , now believe that climate change is underway , but only 36 percent say they worry about it " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals that 64 percent think there 's " a lot of disagreement " among climate scientists on the reality of global warming , when there 's actually a near total consensus . According to a Science essay by Naomi Oreskes , 935 peer-reviewed papers on global warming appeared from 1993 to 2005 and , of 700 that dealt with modern climate change , none challenged the consensus that humans were causing global warming . Another 54 percent of poll respondents think climate change is " a problem for the future , " versus only 44 percent who think it 's already a serious problem . A team of researchers reported in the journal Nature that , unless the world is getting half its energy from non-carbon sources by 2018 , we will see an inevitable doubling-and possible tripling-of atmospheric carbon levels later this century . Another study , published in Science , called for a Manhattan-type crash project to develop renewable energy . Using conservative estimates , they found that within 50 years , humanity will need to be generating at least three times more energy from non-carbon sources than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite the refusal by Australia and the U.S. to ratify the international Kyoto Accords , they have gone into effect , adopted by 55 industrialized nations ( responsible for 55 percent of global emissions ) . The Kyoto signatories have pledged to cut six key greenhouse gases to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . It probably wo n't be enough , since some climate scientists say that a far more dramatic 60 percent cut is needed to avoid the worst effects of global warming . Photograph The notorious gridlock and smog in Los Angeles has spurred groundbreaking clean car rules in California . // It is unclear how many countries can actually meet their Kyoto commitments . In the environmentally oriented European Union , for instance , only England and Sweden are on track to meet their targets . Among the leading countries with emission problems are Denmark , Spain , Ireland , Austria and Belgium . But it 's far too early to give in to despair , since important carbon-saving programs are being launched below the radar , often by local governments , private companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and innovative thinking to achieve real emission reductions , tapping into and modifying consumer habits and ingrained business practices . Countries worldwide have already begun making major changes in the way they do business , creating " cap and trade " CO2 emissions schemes ; writing global warming reduction into procurement policies ; mandating clean-fuel municipal fleets ; and subsidizing clean energy projects . London , England now has its own Climate Change Agency , and is committed to a 20 percent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2010 . Denmark has also announced a switch to clean energy ; it is already 20 percent wind powered , and the Danish Wind Energy Association 's goal is to produce 35 percent of national energy needs by 2015 . But those are only a few of the many ambitious projects that are acting to fill the void caused by official U.S. inaction on the issue . Here 's a country-by-country survey , compiled mostly by local writers , that is by no means complete but representative of a world waking up to the realities of climate change : NORTH AMERICA // The California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California 's clean car emission rules , " says a clearly energized Dan Becker , the Sierra Club 's climate change coordinator . " This is about the most exciting thing out there to fight global warming , and it shows that the U.S. does n't have to have its head in the sand . Governors and mayors get it even if the President does n't . " In 2004 , the California Air Resources Board ( ARB ) approved regulations that would result in a dramatic 22 percent reduction in global warming emissions from vehicles by 2012 , and a 30 percent reduction by 2016 . That 's coupled with California 's existing regulations ( far more stringent than those put in place by the federal government ) to cut the tailpipe emissions that cause local smog . States have the option of following California 's tough standards or the feds ' relaxed ones , and an increasing number of legislatures are siding with Sacramento . Photograph A Los Angeles technician measures vehicle exhaust to help curb smog. // Becker and other campaigners talk about a " tipping point " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burden of producing two versions of their cars and trucks-a super-clean one for California states and a dirtier one for everyone else . That point will be reached when states all around the country sign on to the California program , creating a shipping nightmare for Detroit . One or two more states may force the automakers ' hands . To comply with California 's global warming provisions , the automakers would have to make their vehicles more fuel efficient , and with most of their profits coming from SUVs they 've been loathe to do that . Through the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers ( AAM ) , the carmakers filed suit in 2004 against the California law , claiming it would cost consumers an extra $3,000 for a compliant car , and that only the federal government is empowered to set fuel economy standards . " What the auto companies should be doing is letting their engineers figure out how to work with these standards , " says Bill Magavern , the Sierra Club 's senior representative in Sacramento . " Instead , they 're letting their lawyers loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " argument about jurisdiction . " The California law is about global warming emissions , not fuel economy , " he says . " And the federal law was drafted in the 1970s , before climate change was even an issue . " Meanwhile , California , 11 other states and a coalition of cities ( including Baltimore , Washington and New York ) , environmental groups and the island of American Samoa ( which is threatened by sea-level rise ) are fighting a court battle with the Environmental Protection Agency ( ERA ) , which said in 2003 that it had no authority to regulate CO2 or three other global warming gasses produced by vehicles . The EPA ruling was upheld by a federal appeals court last year , but the states are determined to carry the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court . <p>
