Chapter One There was nothing much to notice about the field , a hundred-metre square of dry grass below a small village in the foothills of the Dolomites . It lay at the bottom of a slope covered with hardwood trees which could easily be culled for firewood , and that was used as an argument to increase the price when the land and the two-hundred-year-old house upon it came to be sold . Off to the north a slant-faced mountain loomed over the small town of Ponte nelle Alpi ; a hundred kilometres to the south lay Venice , too far away to influence the politics or customs of the area . People in the villages spoke Italian with some reluctance , felt more at home in Bellunese dialect . The field had lain untilled for almost half a century , and the stone house had sat empty . The immense slates that made up the roof had shifted with age and sudden changes in temperature , perhaps even with the occasional earthquake that had struck the area during the centuries the roof had protected the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that , for many of the slates had crashed to earth , leaving the upper rooms exposed to the elements . Because the house and property lay at the heart of a contested will , none of the eight heirs had bothered to repair the leaks , fearful that they would never get back the few hundred thousand lire the repairs would cost . So the rain and snow dripped , then flowed , in , nibbling away at plaster andfloorboards , and each year the roof tilted more drunkenly towards the earth . The field , too , had been abandoned for the same reasons . None of the presumptive heirs wanted to expend either time or money working the land , nor did they want to weaken their legal position by being seen to make unpaid use of the property . Weeds flourished , made all the more vital by the fact that the last people to cultivate the land had for decades manured it with the droppings of their rabbits . It was the scent of foreign money that settled the dispute about the will : two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and land , the eight heirs met at the home of the eldest . Before the end of the evening , they had arrived at a unanimous decision to sell the house and land ; their subsequent decision was not to sell until the foreigner had doubled his offer , which would bring the selling price to four times what any local resident would - or could - pay . Three weeks after the deal was completed , scaffolding went up , and the centuries-old , hand-cut slates were hurled down to shatter in the courtyard below . The art of laying the slates had died with the artisans who knew how to cut them , and so they were replaced with moulded rectangles of prefabricated cement that had a vague resemblance to terra cotta tiles . Because the doctor had hired the oldest of the heirs to serve as his foreman , work progressed quickly ; because this was the Province of Belluno , it was done honestly and well . By the middle of the spring , the restoration of the house was almost complete , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new owner , who had spent his professional life enclosed in brightly lit operating rooms and who was conducting the restorations by phone and fax from Munich , turned his thoughts to the creation of the garden he had dreamed about for years . Village memory is long , and it recalled that the old garden had run alongside the row of walnut trees out behind the house , so it was there that Egidio Buschetti , the foreman , decided to plough . The land had n't been worked for most of his own lifetime , so Buschetti estimated that his tractor would have to pass over the land twice , once to cut through the metre-high weeds , and then once again to disc up the rich soil lying underneath . At first Buschetti thought it was a horse - he remembered that the old owners had kept two - and so he continued with his tractor all the way to what he had established as the end of the field . Pulling at the broad wheel , he swung the tractor around and headed back , proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun again , happy at the sound and the feel of the work , sure now that spring had come . He saw the bone sticking up crookedly from the furrow he had just ploughed , the white length of it sharply visible against the nearly black earth . No , not long enough to be a horse , but he did n't remember that anyone had ever kept sheep here . Curious , he slowed the tractor , somehow reluctant to ride over the bone and shatter it . He shifted into neutral and drew to a stop . Pulling on the hand brake , he climbed down from his high metal seat and walked over towards the cantilevered bone that jutted up towards the sky . He bent and reached out to shove it away from the path of the tractor , but a sudden reluctance pulled him upright again , and he prodded at it with the toe of his heavy boot , hoping thus to dislodge it . It refused to move , so Buschetti turned towards the tractor , where he kept a shovel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes fell upon a gleaming white oval a bit farther along the bottom of the furrow . No horse , no sheep had ever gazed out from so round a skull , nor would they leer up at him through the sharpened carnivore teeth so frighteningly like his own . Chapter Two The intuition of the news in just a country town never spreads faster than when it deals with death or disaster , so the news that human bones had been discovered in the garden of the old Orsez house was common knowledge throughout the village of Col di Cugnan before dinnertime . It was not since the death of the mayor 's son in that automobile accident down by the cement factory seven years ago that news had spread so quickly ; even the story about Graziella Rovere and the electrician had taken two days to become common knowledge . But that night the villagers , all seventy-four of them , switched off their televisions , or talked above them , during dinner , trying to think of how it could be and , more interestingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rai 3 , the blonde who wore a different pair of glasses each night , went ignored as she reported the latest horrors in the ex-Yugoslavia , and no one paid the slightest heed to the arrest of the former Minister of the Interior on charges of corruption . Both were by now normal , but a skull in a ditch behind the home of the foreigner , that was news . By bedtime , the skull had been variously reported to have been shattered by a blow from an axe , or a bullet , and to display signs that an attempt had been made to dissolve it with acid . The police had determined , people were certain , that they were the bones of a pregnant woman , a young male , and the husband of Luigina Menegaz , gone off to Rome twelve years ago and never heard from since . That night people in Col di Cugnan locked their doors , and those who had lost the keys years ago and never bothered about them slept less easily than did the others . At eight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of Doctor Litfin and drove across the newly planted grass to park on either side of the two long rows ploughed the day before . It was not until an hour later that a car arrived from the provincial centre of Belluno , carrying the medico legale of that city . He had heard none of the rumours about the identity or cause of death of the person whose bones lay in the field , and so he did what seemed most necessary : he set his two assistants to sifting through the earth to find the rest of the remains . As this slow process advanced , both of the Carabinieri vehicles took turns driving across the soon-destroyed lawn and up to the village , where the six officers had coffees in the small bar , then began to ask the residents of the village if anyone was missing . The fact that the bones seemed to have been in the earth for years did not affect their decision to ask about recent events , and so their researches proved ineffective . In the field below the village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine mesh screen at a sharp angle . Slowly , they poured buckets of earth through it , bending down occasionally to pick out a small bone or anything that looked like it might be one . As they pulled them out , they displayed them to their superior , who stood at the edge of the furrow , hands clasped behind his back . A long sheet of black plastic lay spread at his feet , and as he was shown the bones , he instructed his assistants where to place them , and together they slowly began to assemble their macabre jigsaw puzzle . Occasionally he asked one of the men to hand him a bone , and he studied it for a moment before bending to place it somewhere on the plastic sheet . Twice he corrected himself , once bending to move a small bone from the right side to the left , and another time , with a muttered exclamation , moving another from below the metatarsal to the end of what had once been a wrist . At ten , Doctor Litfin arrived , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden and having driven through the night from Munich . He parked in front of his house and pulled himself stiffly from the driver 's seat . Beyond the house , he saw the countless deep tracks cut into the new grass he had planted with such simple joy three weeks before . But then he saw the three men standing in the field off in the distance , almost as far away as the patch of young raspberry plants he had brought down from Germany and planted at the same time . He started across the destroyed lawn but stopped in his tracks at a shouted command that came from somewhere off to his right . He looked around but saw nothing except the three ancient apple trees that had grown up around the ruined well . Seeing no one , he started again towards the three men in the field . He had taken only a few steps before two men dressed in the ominous black uniforms of the Carabinieri burst out from under the nearest of the apple trees , machine guns aimed at him . Doctor Litfin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had happened fifty years before , his body remembered the sight of armed men in uniform . He put both of his hands above his head and stood rock-still . They came out fully from the shadows then , and the doctor had a hallucinogenic moment of seeing the contrast of their death-black uniforms against the innocent backdrop of pink apple blossom . Their glossy boots trampled across a carpet of fresh-fallen petals as they approached him . ' What are you doing here ? ' the first one demanded . ' Who are you ? ' the other asked in the same angry tone . In Italian made clumsy by fear , he began , ' I 'm Doctor Litfin . I 'm the ... ' he said but stopped to search for the appropriate term . ' I 'm the padrone here . ' The Carabinieri had been told that the new owner was a German , and the accent sounded real enough , so they lowered their guns , though they kept their fingers near the triggers . Litfin took this as permission to lower his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was German , he knew that guns were always superior to any claim to legal rights , and so he waited for them to approach him , but this did not prevent him from turning his attention momentarily back to the three men who stood in the newly ploughed earth , they now as motionless as he , their attention on him and the approaching Carabinieri . The two officers , suddenly diffident in the face of the person who could afford the restorations to house and land evident all around them , approached Doctor Litfin , and as they drew nearer , the balance of power changed . Litfin perceived this , and seized the moment . ' What is all of this ? ' he asked , pointing across the field and leaving it to the policemen to infer whether he meant his ruined lawn or the three men who stood at the other side of it . ' There 's a body in your field , ' the first officer answered . ' I know that , but what 's all this ... ? ' he sought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The marks of the tyre treads seemed actually to grow deeper as the three men studied them , until finally one of the policemen said , ' We had to drive down into the field . ' Though this was an obvious lie , Litfin ignored it . He turned away from the two officers and started to walk towards the other three men so quickly that neither of the officers tried to stop him . When he got to the end of the first deep trench , he called across to the man who was obviously in charge , ' What is it ? ' ' Are you Doctor Litfin ? ' asked the other doctor , who had already been told about the German , what he had paid for the house , and how much he had spent so far on restorations . Litfin nodded and when the other man was slow to answer , asked again , ' What is it ? ' ' I 'd say it was a man in his twenties , ' Doctor Bortot answered and then , turning back to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took Litfin a moment to recover from the brusqueness of the reply , but when he did , he stepped on to the ploughed earth and went to stand beside the other doctor . Neither man said anything for a long time as they stood side by side and watched the two men in the trench scrape away slowly at the dirt . After a few minutes , one of the men handed Doctor Bortot another bone , which , with a quick glance , he bent and placed at the end of the other wrist . Two more bones ; two more quick placements . ' There , on your left , Pizzetti , ' Bortot said , pointing to a tiny white knob that lay exposed on the far side of the trench . The man he spoke to glanced at it , bent and picked it from the earth , and handed it up to the doctor . Bortot studied it for a moment , holding it delicately between his first two fingers , then turned to the German . ' Lateral cuneiform ? ' he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone . Even before the German could speak , Bortot handed it to him . Litfin turned it in his hands for a moment , then glanced down at the pieces of bone laid out on the plastic at their feet . ' That , or it might be the intermediate , ' he answered , more comfortable with the Latin than the Italian . ' Yes , yes , it could be , ' Bortot replied . He waved his hand down towards the plastic sheet , and Litfin stooped to place it at the end of the long bone leading to the foot . He stood up and both men looked at it . ' Ja , ja , ' Litfin muttered ; Bortot nodded . And so for the next hour the two men stood together beside the trench left by the tractor , first one and then the other taking a bone from the two men who continued to sift the rich earth through the tilted screen . Occasionally they conferred about a fragment or sliver , but generally they agreed about the identity of what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring sun poured down on them ; off in the distance , a cuckoo began his mating call , repeating it until the four men were no longer aware of it .
