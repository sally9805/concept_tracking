Chapter One : Della There was another death tonight at the Arcadia . Della Estelle Gifford . There were no family or friends at her side , only us employees . As many times as I have experienced such lonely passings I still do not understand how , with so many people on this planet , so many die alone . MICHAEL KEDDINGTON 'S JOURNAL ARCADIA CARE FACILITY . OGDEN , UTAH . There was a moon that night , a pale crescent that hung low above the canyon and shone weakly into the dying woman 's window . Della 's was not a spectacular death , if any death can be described as spectacular . She made several attempts to blow out a flameless birthday candle , then reclined in her bed , rubbed the translucent skin of her liver spot-flecked forehead , and mumbled something about Errol Flynn . Twenty minutes later she gasped twice , then died . There was no family present at her passing , just the three of us , all paid to be there : Sharon Holt , Brent Griffin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen-foot square . Sharon was the nurse on duty and I was glad for that . Sharon knew death more so than any of us . In her twenty-year tenure as a hospice nurse Sharon had eased the passage of the dying hundreds of times , holding their hands and administering pain relief as they took their final breaths . Likely more times than she could remember , except I would wager that she could remember ; could put a name to each resident , maybe even the time their vitals failed . She was as compassionate as an angel . " No one dies alone , " she would say , and she saw to it that no one on her watch did unless a resident stole off in their sleep . I was grateful that she had been at Esther 's side when she passed away . Without word Sharon pressed her index finger over Della 's wrist , then placed a stethoscope to her chest , straining to hear a heartbeat . Then she checked her watch and recorded the time . It was Brent who was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her birthday . " Brent 's comment was meant as a joke . I shook my head . Sharon ignored him completely , something she did instinctively . It was no great coincidence that Della died on her birthday , as every day was Della 's birthday . As dementia had conquered her ninety-six-year-old mind , two things took root and refused to be extricated the first was that every day she woke to her birthday . Della did n't actually remember the date of her birthday or even the current day just that it was the day . In truth , we did n't know what day Della 's birthday was . A quick glance at her resident record would have enlightened us , but no one ever bothered to do it . Some delusions , even in the clear-minded , are best left unchallenged . We had a candle , Della 's candle , that we would put into her dessert each day at suppertime , be it yellow cake or a green square of gelatin . I once saw it stuck into a scoop of mashed potatoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen tank , fire was not allowed near her , so one candle lasted indefinitely . The eternal flameless . Each evening one of us would take Della her meal with the candle affixed , delivered with a hasty verse of " Happy Birthday , " and Della would beam and sometimes join in , her voice as inconstant as a cell phone in a mountain pass . Then she would smile and clap her hands together and say in a quavering voice , " Thank you for remembering . " " Thirty today , Della ? " At this she would bring her hand to her chest and laugh as hysterically as her frail frame allowed . When the last of her chuckles had subsided , we would ask , " Is Errol going to make it this year ? " She would suddenly frown and say , " No , Errol is in Hollywood . He 's making another picture-show , you know . He wo n't be coming today . " That was the other peculiar aspect of Della 's dementia . She believed she and Errol Flynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he never once made it to her birthday . Sometimes she 'd cuss him out , but she 'd as quickly forgive him , vocally reminding all present ( even if it was only herself ) that it is a husband 's role to provide and Errol was a fine provider and had many fans that proved a considerable distraction . " One must take the bad with the good , " she would say . A newly hired orderly ( I do n't remember her name ; she did n't last long ) once took it on herself to correct Della 's delusion . She informed Della that Errol Flynn was not her husband and had been married to three women in all , fathering children with each of them . Also that he had died thirty years previous . At first Della would not hear the heresy , but after several weeks , the orderly apparently had some success in convincing her . Della became sullen and despondent . After a week of this I decided that I could n't bear it any longer and went in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous orderly who was angry because Errol refused to sign an autograph for her the last time he came by . I told her that Errol had called with his regrets for missing her birthday , but would be in town soon and wanted her to save him some cake if it was n't too much trouble . She was happy again after that . I was genuinely saddened at Della 's passing . Sharon , as resident nurse , pronounced Della dead , then phoned the house physician and obtained a release for the body while Brent and I gave her a bed bath and changed her gown . About an hour later two men from the mortuary arrived . They carted her body off enclosed in a faux velvet bag on a gurney . We saw to it that such things were done as discreetly as possible . A death caused a curious reaction at the Arcadia , a peculiar combination of melancholy and envy . At times roommates of the departed became morose and refused to eat and we would have to put them on special watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , housekeeping would sterilize the room in preparation for its next tenant . The Arcadia was only a thirty-bed facility and there was always someone waiting to get in . It was nearly eleven o'clock and the home slept . The common-area lights were dimmed or turned off , and the hallways were lit by exit signs and staggered fluorescents . Night is not especially kind to the elderly infirm . In the quiet darkness they would often wake disoriented or afraid . Some would shout out for someone to help them or call for a long-deceased spouse . Some would groan incessantly . Though I was used to it , I remember my first night shift . I thought the place sounded like a haunted house . It would scare children , I thought . Some adults too . Most of the residents went to bed around seven-thirty , after dinner , though some of them did not wait to finish their meals before falling asleep . We would wheel them up from the dining room and lift them into their beds . The most notable exception to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a possum . She had been a pharmacist for more than fifty years and was programmed for the graveyard shift . Dressed in overalls and white canvas sneakers , she would push her aluminum walker up and down the halls , inevitably settling at the nurses ' station . She believed that she was more employee than resident and would refer to the other residents as " them crazy old farts " with deliberate self-distancing . At least once a night she 'd talk about her sons ( They grew up mean . It was her own fault ; she never disciplined them ) , ask to check on her money in the Arcadia 's safe to be sure someone had n't absconded with it an event she fully expected or ask for a case-by-case review of the residents ' medicine charts . When we were not at the station she would sit near the counter where she would watch the call light board with the intensity of a Tijuana cabdriver eyeing a traffic light . The moment a light would blink she would start shouting , " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't neglect them . Do I have to do everything around here ? " Though Hazel was our most consistent night walker , she was not our only one . There was Eva . At least twice a week Eva would wake from a sound sleep and make for the exit , intent on walking home . Our explanation that New Jersey is an intolerably long walk from Utah could not dissuade her in the least . Though she moved slowly and rarely got past the nurses ' station , one night she slipped off unnoticed . She was discovered by a motorist a block down the canyon in her nightgown . We installed an alarm on the stairwell door the next day . Then there was " Buzzsaw Raymond . " Raymond had sleep apnea which triggered the loudest snores I had ever heard . Snores that could wake even Brent . Raymond burned through roommates nearly as fast as we could move them in . It was a problem that vexed the Arcadia 's greatest minds until one of the CNAs thought to move Howard in with Raymond and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brent Griffin , was another hallmark of the night shift . Hiring Brent ( " the Griff , " he called himself ) was an act of desperation on the part of the Arcadia . Like most care facilities for the elderly , the Arcadia had a high rate of employee turnover . Brent had been hired on a month before my return , during a drought of applicants a decision Helen , the Arcadia 's director , questioned or rued each and every day of his employment . He had been assigned with Sharon and me to the second floor , and Helen still occasionally apologized to me for that . Brent was lazy , and though there were times all of us wanted to beat him , he was also amusing , which is worth something on a night shift . Brent was a caricature of sorts , a man barely afloat in the murky waters of male self-doubt , forever bent on proving his manhood , usually with stereotypical manifestations of machismo . He had long sideburns and a scraggly bush of hair on his chin which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest , which he shared with any and all who would endure them including the less coherent residents were , when believable , more pathetic than inspiring . Sharon once called him " a man who had been pantsed one too many times in high school . " Ten minutes to eleven I found Brent in the break room . He was sprawled out on the couch , his eyes were closed , and one leg stuck straight out , propped up by the couch 's arm . It had n't been difficult guessing where to find him . Brent worked the usual night shift , from six to two , and despite his schedule , he never really cut back his daily activities , which we all paid for in the later hours of his shift . I shook his foot . " Wake up , Brent . " One eyelid lifted above a grimace . " What ? " he said groggily . " I need you to finish the west wing . " " Huh ? " He looked up at me . " I thought you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He groaned . " Is someone else coming in ? " " Not until midnight . " Just like every night for the last two months , I thought . He took an exaggerated breath then lifted himself to a sitting position . " Yeah , I 'll do it . " When he gained more consciousness he asked , " You workin ' tomorrow ? " " No . I 've got the day off . Faye leaves Saturday . " " I finally met her the other night . She was looking for you . Wish she was looking for me . Do n't get mad or nothing , ' cause I did n't know she was yours , but I made a move on her . Laid down one of the Griff 's sweetest lines . " I could only imagine it . The whole of Brent 's five-foot-six , **29;927;TOOLONG frame leaning against the front counter emphasizing each syllable of his come-on with a tilt of his head or raised eyebrow , " Hey , baby , ai n't it a shame . All those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably all Faye could do to not burst out in laughter . Or beat him senseless . I grinned at the thought of it . " ... where 's she off to ? " " Baltimore . She 's studying medicine at Johns Hopkins . " Brent 's mouth pursed . " Johns Hopkins . Man , I 'm hanging out at the wrong bars . Those looks and a paycheck . How long will she be gone ? " " Four long years . " " Got ta be hating that , man . You guys like engaged ? " " No , " I lied . " We 're promised . " " Whoa . That 's like four years of celibacy . Or sneaking around . Guys like us have our seeds to sow . " I cringed at being lumped into the same category as Brent . " ... ' course that blade cuts both ways , " he continued . " You can bet all those slicky-boy doctors are gon na be working her like a bad leg . You ca n't trust doctors . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicks . " " I do n't think Faye 's in it for either . " " If that babe were mine she would n't be going nowhere . " " Probably why she is n't yours , " I said . He bobbed his head as he stood , though I doubt he knew what I meant . Brent was more stupid than malicious . " Why ai n't you with her tonight ? " " Her girlfriends are throwing her a party . Girls-only deal . " " Oh , " he said , bending the word as if he knew something about such functions that I did n't . I watched him saunter over to the coffee machine in slow motion and knew there would be residents neglected . " I 'll finish the first half of the hall before I go , " I said . Brent took his coffee and sat back into the couch , his legs spread apart and his head back . " No problem , man . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
