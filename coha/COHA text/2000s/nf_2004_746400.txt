This study examined gender and race differences in implicit theories of ability in sports . Results indicated that both African Americans and European Americans were more likely to express an incremental rather than an entity theory . European Americans were more likely than African Americans to accept the notion of ability as a fixed construct . Entity theories did not differ significantly by gender , but females had weaker beliefs in an incremental theory of ability than males . The findings suggest physical education teachers , coaches , and other sports practitioners avoid references to innate racial and gender superiority and instead reinforce the belief that ability can be increased with effort . <p> The study of ability has been challenging because the construct is explained and defined in more than one way . Definitions of ability are numerous and varied , with much disagreement over the precise nature of ability ( Dweek , 2002 ) . A common controversy about the nature of ability is whether ability is innate or acquired . One viewpoint holds that ability is an individual difference variable , and is genetically determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ability is malleable , and can be changed through learning and effort ( Csikszentmihalyi , Rathunde , &; Whalen , 1993 ; Ericsson , 2003 ; Ericsson , Krampe , &; Tesch-Rmer , 1993 ) . <p> Although there is a disagreement about the precise nature of ability , many modern theorists believe that definitions of ability are socially and individually constructed ( Dweek , 2002 ) . Some contemporary authors have speculated that even though researchers refer to a mature conception of ability as an understanding that ability is a stable trait separate from effort , this acceptance varies and there is not universal agreement among the scholars . For example , according to Dweck ( 2002 ) , Alfred Binet , author of the major intelligence test ( IQ ) accepts that children can improve capacity through learning . In the physical activity literature Fleishman ( 1972 ) wrote extensively in his attempts to analyze and describe and distinguish learning from ability in the psychomotor domain . While he refers to ability as a general trait of the individual he argues that many abilities are products of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 ) agree that it seems reasonable that students might possess an innate physical ability , but there is no scientific evidence that these traits can be measured . It is very difficult to separate innate ability from learning and experience ( Safrit &; Wood , 1995 ) . From the literature reviewed it seems clear that ability is a vague term that is difficult to define in a precise way . Scientists might argue that ability is a fixed capacity but individuals are free to construct their own meanings and some mature learners could believe that ability is controllable ( Dweek , 2002 ) . It is not the personal definition of ability that is critical but rather the consequences of the various beliefs surrounding ability . The important issue is related to a learner 's views about how and under what conditions his or her ability will affect performance . <p> The role of ability conceptions in motivation , personality , and development has been the focus of recent research in educational and sport contexts ( Dweck , 1999 ; Dweck , Chiu , &; Hong , 1995 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Famose , Cury , Fox &; Durand , 1996 ) . Implicit theories of intelligence or ability are characterized as either entity or incremental . Students with an entity theory believe that ability is natural and fixed and can not be changed , whereas those with an incremental theory perceive it as a malleable quality that can be changed through their long-term efforts . Different labels , including innate and acquired , are often attached to these two components , but they represent parallel constructs across these models . An incremental theory of ability is positively associated with many adaptive motivational and cognitive patterns that should produce positive achievement outcomes , whereas an entity theory of ability is related to a number of maladaptive motivational and cognitive processes that may result in performance deteriorations ( Dweck , 1999 ; Dweck , et al. , 1995 ; Dweck &; Legget , 1988 ; Sarrazin et al. , 1996 ) . <p> In general , entity theorists are more likely to make negative self-inferences from failure . They attribute their failure to lack of ability because they think that high effort implies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attribute their failure to lack of effort . When encountering challenging tasks , entity theorists are more likely to display cognitive , affective , and behavioral aspects of helpless responses , while incremental theorists are more likely to display mastery-oriented patterns and positive affect . They value effort and focus on learning something new even if they go through some failures ( Dweck , 1999 ; Dweck et al. , 1995 ; Dweck &; Legget , 1988 ) . <p> Implicit theories of ability differ according to gender , race , learning environments , and cultures ( Dweck , 2002 ) . In educational contexts , African Americans are more likely to embrace an incremental theory of ability than European Americans , while girls tend to hold an entity theory as compared to boys . No significant interaction effect between race and gender was reported in the research literature . Although there has been substantial inquiry into issues concerning gender , race , and beliefs about the nature of ability , the rationale for race and gender differences in ability conceptions is not clear . Stereotype threat has been offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aronson , 1997 ) , while a pattern of learned helplessness attributable to stereotypes provides a possible explanation for girls ' entity theories . Racial and gender differences in conceptions of ability in sport have not been investigated . Because of the dominant racial and gender sport stereotypes that exist , examining these variables in the sport context provides a viable approach to help us better understand why conceptions of ability vary according to race and gender . <p> Stereotype Theory <p> A stereotype is a description of the over-generalization of characterizations about the members belonging to a social group ( Cauthen , Robinson , &; Krauss , 1971 ; Hamilton , Sherman , &; Ruvolo , 1990 ; Wittenbrink , Gist , &; Hilton , 1997 ) . Stereotypes have been passed on and perpetuated from one generation to the next . All human beings are subject to the development of stereotypical thinking . No one can avoid assimilating the prevailing and often implicit knowledge of stereotypes , which shapes human experience through the process of socialization ( Ehrlich , 1973 ; Wittenbrink et al. , 1997 ) . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , he or she is automatically perceived as possessing the innate characteristics of that group ( Cauthen et al. , 1971 ) . Race and gender are core concepts on which stereotypes are formed . <p> Two types of stereotypes have been identified in social science literature : positive and negative . A positive stereotype describes favorable and valued attributes of the self and group , which are distinctive from other groups . In contrast , a negative stereotype describes unfavorable and negative characteristics of the self and group ( Steele , 1997 , 2000 ; Steele &; Aronson , 1995 ; Stone , Lynch , Sjomeling , &; Darley , 1999 ) . <p> Recent stereotype threat theory suggests that people avoid accepting a negative attribute that is assigned to their group ( Steele , 1997 ) . Most people are motivated to protect positively valued characterizations of their specific personal and group attributes ( Tajfel , 1982 ; Tajfel &; Turner , 1979 , 1986 ; Turner , 1982 ) . When individuals face negative characteristics applied to their group , they are afraid of confirming them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impair people 's self-esteem . After individuals are exposed to negative stereotypes for a lifetime , they are likely to internalize an " inferiority anxiety " ( Steele &; Aronson , 1995 , p. 797 ) . Therefore , individuals would be likely to reject negative group stereotypes as attributes of themselves ( Darley &; Gross , 1983 ; Steele &; Aronson , 1995 ) . <p> Racial stereotypes . Race is theorized to be one of the core stereotypes . Typically , racial differences are attributed not only to biological , but also cultural , social , and environmental factors ( Carlston , 1983 ; Harpalani , 1998 ; Harrison , 1995 ; Hunter , 1998 ; LaVeist , 1996 ) . Research efforts give convincing evidence that race is a social variable ( Smith &; Lewis , 1985 ; Steele &; Aronson , 1995 ; Stone et al. , 1999 ) . Therefore , in this paper race is conceptualized on the basis of social , cultural , and behavioral forces that expose racial differences . <p> Steele and Aronson ( 1995 ) demonstrated that simply asking participants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such indicators of racial stereotypes could engage stereotype threat . In their study , participants were asked to indicate their racial identity on their test . Although the test was constructed to measure a non-stereotyped dimension , this made race salient , and African American college students performed poorly . The researchers rationalized that African American college students ' poor performance was attributed to their inference that they would be evaluated based on the negative stereotype concerning intelligence because they were asked to indicate their racial identity . <p> A common racial stereotype held by the public is that African Americans are born with physical superiority as compared to European Americans . Relying on the work of Coakley ( 1998 ) and Wiggins ( 1997 ) , Stone et al . ( 1999 ) assumed that for African Americans , having natural athletic ability would represent a positive stereotype , while having less intelligence , even in a sport context , was classified as a negative attribute . In contrast , for European American athletes , having less natural athletic ability was perceived as a negative attribute , but being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their study demonstrated that framing an athletic task in the context of negative racial stereotypes had an adverse effect on performance . <p> African Americans are generally viewed as physically superior in nature as compared to European Americans , and that innate superiority has been very closely linked to intellectual inferiority ( Edwards , 1971 ; Entine , 2000 ; Harrison , 2001 ) . Because of the strong socially implicit link between African American athletic superiority and intellectual inferiority , for African American college students the overall stereotype may become negative . If this is true , then African Americans would be likely to reject the notion of superior natural ability in order to maintain and protect positive self-esteem based on stereotype threat theory . They should be more likely to acknowledge effort as an influential factor on success in sport . <p> Gender stereotypes . Women have been stereotyped as biologically and physically inferior to men . This cultural notion has been passed on from one generation to another generation through school education , community , media , and parents , and accepted as a fact existing between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Eccles &; Harold , 1991 ; Gould , 1996 ) . Gender stereotypes have pressured women and men to behave in certain ways in order to satisfy the expectations of society , which has limited women 's involvement in physical activity and sports , especially activities that are vigorous in nature ( Harrison , Lee , &; Belcher , 1999 ) . The stereotypical view of women as inferior in sport is not as complex as the assumption of racial superiority and the accompanying implication of intellectual inferiority . The view of women as inferior in sport may not necessarily be viewed as a negative attribute , given that it is so deeply ingrained in our culture . Rather , the view of women as less able in sport is consistent with societal expectations , so that women who are athletically gifted are at risk to be viewed as inappropriate . Athletic superiority runs counter to expectations , and for some females may actually constitute a negative image . <p> The stereotypical acceptance of females ' inferior sport ability is associated with a pattern of learned helplessness . Learned helplessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation and that nothing can be done to change it ( Seligman , 1972 , 1975 ) . If ability is viewed as stable and unchangeable , a sense of learned helplessness is reflected in a belief that success is dependent on innate ability ( entity theory ) rather than effort ( incremental theory ) . If ability can not be changed , then the belief in the efficacy of effort may be weakened . That is , if females lack ability in sport , no matter how hard they try , their efforts will not improve their performance . Individuals who display a learned helpless pattern show negative affects and emotions , lower effort and persistence , and performance decrements ( Diener &; Dweck , 1978 ; Dweck , 1999 ) . <p> Stereotypes and Ability Conceptions <p> Stereotypes and beliefs are interrelated and have some characteristics in common . They are , however , distinct cognitive structures . Beliefs are accepted propositions that are an integral part of students ' motivational constructs ( Devine , 1989 ; Ehrlich , 1973 ) . They can orient the goals that students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display during the learning processes , and also determine how students interpret and respond to achievement events , especially in the face of some learning challenges and difficulties ( Dweck , 1999 ) . <p> Social psychologists have demonstrated that individual self-beliefs are influenced by the stereotypes held by the social group to which one belongs . Positive and negative racial stereotyped beliefs can be a powerful influence on individuals ' self-perceptions ( Gaines et al. , 1997 ) . If so , then it is possible that knowledge of the positive and negative racial and gender-role stereotyping beliefs about sports ability could have an important effect on their self-beliefs of the nature of sports ability . <p> Although there is clear evidence that theories of ability represent an important motivational construct and that racial and gender stereotypes relevant to ability in sport exist , it is unclear how race and gender and beliefs about the nature of ability interact . The purpose of this study was to investigate whether college students ' implicit theories of ability in sport settings differ as a function of race and gender . Based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hypothesized that African American participants would be more likely to embrace an incremental theory of ability and to reject an entity theory of ability than European Americans . On the basis of stereotypes and previous literature on learned helplessness , we hypothesized females would be were more likely to hold an entity theory and less likely to embrace an incremental theory . Method <p> Participants <p> The participants in this study were 238 college students ( 57 male and 62 female African Americans and 57 male and 62 female European Americans ) enrolled in a wide range of classes at a university in the southeastern United States . Individuals were not asked to indicate their academic majors , but classes where data were collected included a broad range of academic majors , so relatively few participants were physical education/kinesiology majors . Since race is viewed as a social variable for the purpose of this paper , participants ' own racial designation was used . The students ' ages ranged from 18 to 28 years ( M age=20.6 years , SD=1.92 ) . Informed consent was obtained from all participants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instrumentation <p> The Conceptions of the Nature of Athletic Ability Questionnaire ( CNAAQ-2 ; Wang &; Biddle , 2001 ) , which consists of 12 five-point Likert-type items , was employed to assess students ' conceptions of ability in sports . The 12-item measure consists of four first order factors with three items for each factor ( learning , improvement , stable , and gift ) and two higher-order factors ( Incremental and Entity ) . The incremental scale was assessed through two subscales reflecting learning ( e.g. , " to reach a high level of performance in sports , I must go through periods of learning and training " ) and improvement ( e.g. , " in sports , if you work hard at it , you will always get better " ) . The entity scale was assessed through two subscales reflecting stable ( e.g. , " I have a certain level of ability in sports and I can not really do much to change that level " ) and gift ( e.g. , " you need to have a certain ' gift ' to be good at sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree " to " strongly disagree . " This measure has been employed to assess sports ability beliefs in several studies by Biddle and his colleagues ( Wang &; Biddle , 2001 ; Wang , Chatzisarantis , Spray , &; Biddle , 2002 ) , and has been established as a valid and reliable instrument . The questions were not specific to any particular sport . Rather , items are intended to assess students ' conceptions of ability in sports in general . <p> Data Collection <p> The primary investigator administered the instrument to participants from a variety of majors in regularly scheduled classes . The participants were not initially told the purpose or significance of the study , but were debriefed after they completed the instrument . They were told that there were no right or wrong answers , and the importance of reading each statement carefully was stressed . <p> Data Analysis <p> To make comparisons across subscales , means and standard deviations for each subscale by race ( African American and European American ) and gender were calculated by dividing the sum of the subscale scores by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subscales was assessed using Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients . The alpha coefficients for an entity of theory and an incremental theory of ability were .65 and .74 respectively . The alpha coeffcient for the entity scale is low and results should be interpreted with caution . A 2 ( race ) X 2 ( gender ) profile analysis using a repeated statement on theory ( entity vs. incremental ) was performed to determine if theories of ability in sport vary by race and gender . Results <p> Means and standard deviations for entity and incremental theories by race are reported in Table 1 . The profile analysis yielded significant main effects for race ( F ( 1,234 ) = 4.24 , p&lt; .040 , gender ( F ( 1,234 ) = 7.04 , p&lt;.0085 ) , and theory of ability ( F ( 1,234 ) = 550.14 , p&lt;.0001 ) . The interactions were not significant . Inspection of the means for the theories of ability indicates participants expressed a stronger incremental theory as compared to an entity theory . <p> Univariate ANOVAs were used to follow-up the race and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , but European Americans had stronger beliefs in an entity theory of ability than African Americans ( F ( 1,234 ) = 4.80 , p&lt;.0295 , d=0.29 ) . Entity theories did not differ significantly by gender , but males had stronger beliefs in incremental theory of ability than females ( F ( 1,234 ) = 4.36 , p&lt;.038 , d=0.27 ) . Discussion <p> The purpose of this study was to investigate how implicit theories of ability about sport vary as a function of race and gender . Overall , participants in the study regardless of race and gender were more likely to express an incremental rather than an entity theory of ability . That is , individuals embraced the belief that , through effort and hard work , sports ability as reflected by performance can be improved . An incremental theory , widely considered to be a more adaptive motivational construct ( Csikszentmihalyi , et al. , 1993 ; Dweck , 1999 ; Ericsson , et al. , 1993 ) , reflects a positive image , valuing a work ethic , and regardless of race and gender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of effort in sport . One explanation for this finding is the participant population sampled in this study . College students may be a homogenous group with regard to their incremental theories in that they believe that effort and hard work will produce positive results . <p> Racial Differences <p> African Americans were less likely to support the notion of ability as a fixed construct than European Americans , providing partial support for our hypothesis . Most people are motivated to protect a positive self-image ( Tajfel &; Turner , 1979 , 1986 ) . According to stereotype threat theory , people will avoid accepting a negative attribute about their group as their individual identity , since acceptance of negative stereotypes can threaten self-esteem . African Americans are generally viewed as physically superior in nature as compared to European Americans , and that innate superiority has been very closely linked to intellectual inferiority ( Edwards , 1971 ; Harrison , 2001 ) . This strong socially implicit link between African American athletic superiority and intellectual inferiority seems to produce a negative stereotype related to superior innate ability . Consistent with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aronson ( 1995 ) , African American participants in this study were less likely to support an entity theory of ability than European Americans , suggesting that , when confronted with the negative racial stereotype , they tended to deny the over-generalized attributes of the self and group in order to maintain positive self-esteem . <p> European Americans were somewhat more likely to acknowledge that innate ability could be an influential factor on sport performance . Tajfel and Turner ( 1979 ) suggested that people are motivated to maintain a positive image of their group by enhancing negative stereotypes about other groups , thus bolstering their own social identity . While they expressed a strong belief that ability can be improved with effort , perhaps to compensate for their perceived inferiority in sports , European Americans viewed natural ability to be a more influential factor than African Americans . <p> Gender Differences <p> The finding that females were less likely than males to endorse an incremental theory of ability than males also partially supports our hypothesis , and is consistent with the view of females being at risk for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as physically inferior to males throughout the centuries . A lifetime of exposure to gender stereotypes about their inferior ability in sport may have weakened their belief in the efficacy of effort to improve performance in sport . That is , no matter how hard they try , they may not be able to improve their performance . This stereotypical pattern of thinking serves to limit women 's involvement in physical activity and sports ( Harrison , et al. , 1999 ) . <p> Entity theorists are more likely than incremental theorists to display cognitive , affective , and behavioral aspects of helpless responses in the face of challenges and difficulties ( Dweck , 1999 ) . Guiding students away from beliefs that sports ability is fixed , and reinforcing the belief that ability can be improved with effort , may help to alleviate maladaptive inferences and help student athletes cope with the obstacles that are inevitable in a challenging sports context . Our findings suggest that race and gender affect beliefs about the nature of ability and consequently should be considered as we try to foster incremental theories of ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications and provide direction for future research . If physical education teachers , coaches , and other sports practitioners want to create a motivational climate that will encourage all individuals to be actively engaged in physical activities without negatively affecting their self-esteem , it is important to avoid references to innate racial and gender superiority . Reinforcing the belief that ability can be increased with effort is more likely to foster active engagement . Even though the racial and gender stereotypes held by most people may be difficult to change , it is possible that we can reduce the influence of stereotype threats by the creation of a positive social climate . Awareness of the potential negative impact of references to innate superiority based on race , gender or any other characteristic is important in this regard . <p> Limitations of the Study <p> This study was an initial attempt to investigate race and gender differences in conceptions of ability in sport . Several limitations are evident , in that a convenience sample of college students was used and the data collection was limited to a single questionnaire . The results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research is worth pursuing , but many questions need to be explored . Although these results suggest that African Americans view innate physical superiority as a negative attribute , the nature of this belief and its effect on self-esteem are unclear . A qualitative approach exploring the effect of a negative stereotype has the potential to increase our understanding . Additionally , the effects of stereotypes on European Americans need further exploration . It is also important to investigate other racial/ ethnic groups . <p> Future Research <p> The nature of ability in sport is another issue that merits attention , as the precise nature or definition of ability in sport is not clear . This issue is complicated in the sport arena by the interaction between the notions of ability as capacity , skill level , and performance . Individuals may believe that ability is constant ( an entity theory ) , but that they can improve their skill level and performance through effort and practice . In order to clarify practical issues with regard to implicit theories of ability in sport , it seems important to address how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability and performance .
