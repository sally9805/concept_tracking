No Place Like Home For years my husband , Dave , and I had a ritual on Sunday afternoons . He would lift me into the front seat of his car and drive to the frozen yogurt store , where he would purchase two cones . Then he would drive me around the fancy neighborhoods in Madison , Wisconsin , the city where we lived . It was our time together without the kids , and it was a way to get me out of the house , forget about my declining physical abilities , and enjoy life . When the Sunday was gray and overcast , it was even better because the lights in the fancy houses were on and I could get a glimpse of their interiors . It never entered my mind that I would one day live in a house like one of them . Photograph // After our two children graduated from college , Dave and I talked about moving from the ranch-style house where we had lived for 26 years . There were drawbacks to that house that were not fixable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to pull the van out and open the wheelchair lift on the driveway . After 15 years of loading and unloading me in snow , sleet , or rain , the thought of a three-car garage was very appealing . There were more serious flaws . Because of the configuration of the hallways and the weight of the doors , I could n't get out of the house without help . We had to leave the doors unlocked when I was alone . And the windows , all the windows , were so high I could only see the treetops . Over the years we occasionally looked at houses on the market . But we always came away with the feeling that the cost of retrofitting an existing house would be too much . Yet Dave was n't ready for a condo ( he likes yard work ) , and I wanted a place that our kids could come home to with their families . Then a realtor friend showed us a new , unoccupied house with an open floor plan . When we walked in the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an epiphany for usand I knew we 'd build , not buy . Drawing up our plan We wanted the house to be accessible from the front door and from the threecar garage . Dave did n't want to lose space in the garage to a ramp ; he wanted a level entrance directly into the house . He also wanted drains in the garage floor for all of the snow and ice my scooter wheels picked up on winter outings . I wanted a LARGE office with easy access to files , books , and office equipment . I wanted the office to overlook the street so I could see what was going on in the neighborhood . ( In our ranch house , my office was in the back , in a corner of our bedroom . ) And I wanted windows that were low enough for me to see out . After seeing that house with an open floor plan , I knew the subtle accessibility modifications we needed would add , not detract , from the overall design of the house . Meeting with the builder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We told him we wanted all doorways to be 36 " wide and we did n't want any surface change to be greater than 3/8 " . He said , " No problem . " By sinking the basement slightly deeper than normal , he could ramp a cement sidewalk to the front door and eliminate a ramp in the garage altogether . For easy care and easy rolling , we chose hardwood and ceramic tile floors throughout most of the house . In the great room , the master bedroom , and in our two offices where there is carpeting , there 's a seamless transition from the hardwood floors . Dave does all the cooking due to my limitation , so we did n't lower the sink , stove , or cabinet countertops . But he likes me to be with him in the kitchen as he cooks , so we made a wide aisle around the island cooktop so that I can get to the stove for a taste test or to the silverware drawer to set the table . I designed a kitchen table with no legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table up-and it can seat six people . The chairs are upholstered and on rollers , so I can move them when I set or clear the table . We included waist-level light switches , lever handles on all doors , remote control blinds in my office , and large bathrooms with grab bars near the toilets and a rollin shower . My friends and older relatives have commented on the ease of operation of the lever-handle doorknobs , the convenience of the bathroom grab bars , and the comfort of the raised toilet seats . Toddlers who visit love the lowered light switches . We had the front door and the garage door wired so we could add automatic doors in the future . Currently , I can still open and close doors myself . The front door has glass sidelights that allow me to see who 's there before I unlock and open it . We wired an elevator shaft to the lower level , but we 'll wait to put the elevator in . Let the sun shine in ! I meant it about windows . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turn , I can see the world around me . I ca n't describe the healing energy I receive from light pouring in . I feel like a princess in a grand castle . On Sunday afternoons I see people driving slowly past the houses in my new neighborhood , and I think back to those times when Dave and I did that . I feel blessed to be living in the house of our dreams !

It simmered like a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirligigs on porches , then gusted up hard enough to rattle windows in their frames and bow the jagged crowns of Joshua trees and yucca plants , roaring in across the empty California desert as if looking for a place to hide from whatever chased it . <p> A storm was coming , but nobody had the slightest clue how bad it was going to get . <p> The news of the day was focused elsewhere , loaded with the same domestic absurdity and foreign atrocity as ever , fodder aplenty for arguments that the world continued to chase its own tail , or charge straight off a cliff . <p> For those looking for signs of the end times-aside from the wars , floods , famines , hurricanes , earthquakes , tsunamis , conspiracies , scandals , UFO sightings , soaring oil prices , homosexual agendas , and polar ice caps melting-there were more than a few bits of good news . <p> A " rather popular " Shiite cleric-whose name reporters dutifully mangled with every repetition-was killed by a suicide bomber in Basra , along with two dozen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American occupation of Iraq , he foretold his own death , but proclaimed that " I will be the last to die . " <p> The assassin who made the cleric a martyr was disguised as an Iraqi policeman . His prophecy held true for three eerily quiet days , until this morning , when an IED outside Kirkuk flipped a Humvee filled with marines . <p> In other news-and a stunning reversal of centuries-old doctrine-the Catholic Church issued a digital papal bull closing the limbo loophole , retroactively consigning untold millions of pagan babies to the fires of hell . <p> This , combined with their admission that life on other planets did not contradict biblical infallibility-since extraterrestrials would be " God 's children , too " - begged the question : what else did the pope suddenly know that he was n't letting the rest of the world in on ? <p> And in New Zealand , global warming had finally given comfort to bereaved humanity , or at least some closure , as a melting glacier off Baffin Island disgorged the frigid remains of a Kiwi survey plane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loved ones and descendents gathered on a chartered ship to watch as the wreckage thawed in the summer sun , then tumbled into the sea . <p> Signs and portents . But mostly smoke and mirrors . For gloomy true believers and faithless curmudgeons alike , the real indicators never appeared as mainstream news . They were tiny details , stuck between the cracks of consensus reality : hidden in sacred texts and environmental reports , research dug from the Fortean Times , or the rantings of little-known small-town cable access prophets . <p> For most people , the only news that mattered was the substance of life that impacted them directly : money , jobs , friends , and loved ones . The world was too big , too unwieldy to fathom . The question was , " How are you today ? " <p> On a desert road in the Southern California night , a white sedan passed a billboard asking what would JESUS DO ? <p> The frightened people inside asked themselves the same question . It was a personal question , which they kept to themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets . <p> But the storm was blowing in . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
