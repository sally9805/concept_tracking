Section : Hands On strategies AN OPERATING MANUAL FOR BUSINESS Research shows that innovation wo n't happen without a diverse work force . Then why do so many CEOs clone themselves for every position ? <p> IT 'S HARD TO imagine the top executives of Mark IV Transportation &; Logistics getting together to socialize on week-ends . They 're a pretty unlikely lot : a cautious president wearing a dowdy bow tie ; a former truck driver who climbed the ranks to executive vice president ; a lesbian in a company polo shirt ; and a 43-year-old morn with a corporate background . CEO Jerry Giampaglia , an eager optimist fond of custom-made suits and contact sports , ca n't think of much he has in common with any of them , really . <p> The group could n't be more different from the cozy collection of friends and family that ran Mark IV for nearly a decade . It 's also the most talented team the Rochelle Park , N.J.-based messenger service has ever seen . For years , the company had been in a rut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new team drove revenue to $20 million in just five years , transforming a small courier service into a major logistics operation that competes for business with Federal Express . " We are nothing alike when we 're outside this company , " Giampaglia says of his group , " but when we walk through those doors , we 're clicking . " <p> Whether times are good or bad , business owners complain about how hard it is to find talented employees . But could it be that entrepreneurs are fishing in too shallow a pool ? Think about it . How many times have you heard it said of a job candidate " He 'll be a great fit " ? Ideally , of course , a great fit is someone who brings a needed talent . But " He 'll be a great fit " can also mean " We like this person because he thinks like we do . " In other words : He 's likely to agree with us . <p> Hiring , of course , is one of the most difficult tasks a manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setback . As a result , the safest bet often wins out , and in most cases that means a candidate with a background and disposition just like the CEO 's . Eventually , and often unintentionally , you wind up with a company of clones . " I do n't think any manager wants to admit it , but that 's exactly what happens , " says Tom Long , who works with entrepreneurs at Solid Oak Consulting in Chicago . It 's not necessarily a question of ethnicity , gender , disabilities , and the like . There are other kinds of diversity to consider as well  --  of personality , sensibility , work style  --  that can be just as important in driving a company 's success . <p> To be sure , loads of companies are run by people cut from the same cloth . But such teams are far less likely to spur growth , many academics argue . Homogeneity simply does not breed innovation , says Anne Donnellon , an associate professor of organizational behavior at Babson College . In one 2003 study , researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murder mystery . The case was more likely to be solved by groups of people from different social backgrounds . More homogeneous groups were both more likely to be wrong and more confident of their answers . " For good problem solving and decision making , you need a diversity of personality types , " Donnellon says . <p> Venture capitalists understand this , and often shy away from companies in which the CEO clones himself or her self for every job . " You look for healthy contention , " says Chris Pacitti , general partner at Austin Ventures in Austin . The obvious question is : Is it possible to work with an executive team composed of people who might prefer not to have dinner together ? <p> Giampaglia insists that it is . For 10 years , Mark IV was a genial place , run by a tightly knit group of friends and family , most of them men , who kept banker 's hours and often met for drinks or sporting events after work . At meetings , colleagues seldom disagreed with one another , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little debate . When Giampaglia tried to schedule a Saturday meeting to brainstorm new strategies , his suggestion was met with groans . <p> The company provided three basic services , just like nearly every other courier service in town . Revenue was stagnant , and Giampaglia eventually came to the realization that it probably would remain that way as long as the same clubby group of managers was in place . But the idea of changing was scary . He liked these people . He was comfortable with them , and he trusted them . <p> Nonetheless , the next time a position opened , Giampaglia tried something different . He forced himself to look at candidates that Mark IV probably would have shunned in the past . And he started hiring them . John LoPresti , a bow-tie-wearing teetotaler , was hired as president because he expressed a craving to create a truly great company . When the position of quality operations manager opened up , Bridget Pucheu came into an interview and admitted that she was n't qualified for the job as it had been advertised . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discussed the lengths she would go to solve any problem , Giampaglia decided to take a chance . Later , despite his aversion to loud , cocky extroverts , Giampaglia forced himself to hire just such a person , sensing that the man would bring true passion to his work . " Customers love him , " Giampaglia says . <p> Most of the old crew has slowly faded away . Today , meetings are more raucous and consensus is harder to achieve . But these arguments often spark new ideas . Indeed , instead of providing just three services , Mark IV now offers to customize its services for all of its clients . As a result , the company is constantly spawning and sculpting new innovations in a way the old team never did . Revenue has increased more than sixfold . And Giampaglia 's having a lot more fun . " In the old company , the challenges found us and we sweated them out , " he says . " Now , we create challenges and love finding solutions , " <p> Of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire people you do n't like . Indeed , while a certain measure of conflict is healthy , too much conflict can be destructive . ( See " Culture Shock " on the previous page . ) Austin Ventures ' Pacitti , for example , encourages the firms he invests in to " focus on the chemistry " when making an important hire . <p> Christopher Kuenne , president and founder of Rosetta Marketing Strategies in Princeton , N.J. , feels the same way and is extremely cautious about whom he hires . But because Rosetta specializes in understanding consumer behavior worldwide , diversity has been part of the company 's business plan from the outset . Indeed , the firm 's 100-person work force is about as polyglot as you 'll find in terms of ethnicity , gender , and personality type . <p> But rather than pursuing diversity as an end in itself , Kuenne says it 's the natural result of a painstaking hiring process designed to find people " who are really , really smart and really , really driven . We have serious jocks around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and optimists . We have introverts and extroverts . But what makes a fit is the ambition and drive to change the game .
