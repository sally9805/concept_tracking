// A good-looking man rolled to the stop sign as I rounded the corner on my scooter . He greeted me ; I guess I looked bewildered . " You were my grade school counselor , " he said . I was pleased ; I wondered which child he had been . I had worked as a counselor at the Mendocino Grammar School in 1995 as an intern . I enjoyed great success with the children and had a good relationship with my peers . There was a job opening for a school psychologist for the following year . I applied ; I thought I was a shoo-in . My rsum was impressive and I had been doing the job for a year . I waited eagerly to hear when my interview would be . Three days before school started , I received a call from the principal saying someone else had been hired . I was never even offered an interview . I wanted that job ! According to the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) , all pre-offer inquiries about an individual 's diagnosis or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current abilities required by the job . However , I had readily disclosed ; everyone knew I had MS . It was no big deal . Or so I thought . Had I been more savvy , I might have thought I was being discriminated against . Instead , I decided to move on . Does disclosure hurt ? Pamela Hirshberg , programs manager at the National MS Society 's Southern California Chapter , advises her clients that it might . She strongly urges people to think through how their peers and supervisors might react and to practice what they will ask for with an employment counselor or advisor . " In my employment groups , I tell people not to disclose unless they need a specific accommodation , " Hirshberg said . " Even then , they do n't need to tell their diagnosis . They need to explain how an accommodation will solve problems caused by a medical condition , " she said . Does ADA protect us ? According to ADA attorney Charles Goldman , who practices in Washington , D.C. , enforcement issues are rarely clear-cut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Employers who disobey the law can be cited for non-compliance . But most never go to litigation according to Pamela Hirshberg . " To go to litigation an employer would have to say you were refused a job , or terminated , or not promoted because you have MS . Employers are too smart to do that nowadays , " she said . There are many more subtle ways for employers to discriminate . The best , most specialized attorneys may know all the fine points . If you decide to make a formal complaint , it is also very important to have your neurologist on board . You may be called on to provide professional medical opinion about whether you can do a specific job . Clearly fighting employment discrimination in court is difficult , expensive , time-consuming , and emotionally draining . But ADA does offer us some protection because it has helped change public attitudes . Some background I first heard the phrase " reasonable accommodation " years before it became the cornerstone of the ADA . It appeared in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with disabilities . Some very progressive private employers adopted policies of this act long before ADA made them legally obligated to do so . // The ADA was passed by Congress in 1990 . It was the first comprehensive legislation passed by any country to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability . It covers all aspects of the employment relationship , from recruitment to firing , and it goes well beyond those issues to provide protections in public facilities , including transportation , telephones , and more . Historically , ADA is an extension of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , guaranteeing full participation in American society for all people with disabilities , just as the Civil Rights Act guaranteed this for all people regardless of their race , sex , national origin , or religion . The landscape for people with disabilities has changed dramatically in the years since . Before that time it was unusual to see disabled people who were working . Today , attitudinal barriers continue to break down as more people with disabilities become employed . Moreover , employers are aware that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redefined disability ADA covers almost everyone with MS . It does n't apply only to those in wheelchairs . It covers every person with an impairment that " substantially limits one or more major life activities . " Invisible symptoms like MS fatigue or bladder dysfunction clearly fit this definition . Initially people thought about ADA making workplaces wheelchair accessible . They were n't thinking about people with MS who might require an adjusted schedule because of issues of stamina . But an adjusted schedule can be a reasonable accommodation based on the " must do " functions of a job . Suppose you are a toll taker on a free-way and MS fatigue leaves you too tired to get to work . You ca n't expect the highway department to keep you on . ( You could ask for a different type of job . ) But if you were an accountant for the highway department , you might say , " Let 's adjust my schedule . " A vacant desk and a vacant tollbooth are two different stories . Adjusting an accountant 's schedule could be considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system is far from perfect , reasonable accommodations keep many people with disabilities employed , and that in turn slowly educates the public about us . The more visible we are , the better . For that reason I roll in the Fourth of July parade in my town every year . When I 'm out in public , I 'm helping to raise public awareness about people who use wheelchairs . Did ADA work for me ? By 1990 my function was noticeably declining . I struggled more and more with fatigue and with pain . I have an MA in Art History and was working as an art critic . I could no longer climb stairs or do the hustling necessary for my job . I agonized about what I should do . With the help of my therapist , I decided to study psychology and become a psychotherapist . A friend told me that California 's Department of Rehabilitation ( DOR ) would help people who needed to make career changes for health reasons , so I contacted them . My DOR counselor was a wonderful man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and had me attend workshops with other excellent counselors . With their help I entered a graduate program and received my MA in Clinical Psychology in 1993 . The DOR helped pay my tuition and subsidized books and school supplies . But then my career plans derailed . My marriage ended . I was on my own . And my MS was progressing . I had to move to a rural community , and there I had to develop my own counseling internships . I ended up working with many different populations-from children to alcohol and drug addicts . In all my internships , reasonable accommodations were made for me without questions . I was granted flexible work hours . The DOR purchased an adapted van to carry me and my scooter . Driving instruction was provided . Occupational therapists ( OTs ) designed plans to minimize my fatigue and maximize my function . It was done with great sensitivity . My life was on a roll . // Then came " The Driving Evaluation . " Here I got into some murky territory . The driving test was scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might compare it to an able-bodied person having to climb a wall as part of a driving test . On the final day I was not allowed to drive when my energy was at its peak . The same OT who had taught me to minimize the impact of my fatigue by scheduling tasks for my best times , now insisted that I do several extra transfers , and take the test after I was totally exhausted . I did not pass . I appealed and was granted a new evaluation , but it had to be done in a distant city , where the three-day exam would be compressed into a single day . I tried to argue , but the OT insisted that they needed to see me " at my worst . " Ultimately , I was advised to close my file with the DOR . The hand controls would be removed from the van and I would no longer be able to drive . I had no other options , so , reluctantly , I took their advice . I am still processing this loss . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my home . This works well . There is much work to be done . With my background , I feel well qualified to be part of whatever comes next . Where we all are now Despite ongoing problems , the world is very different from what it was before the ADA . Today individuals with disabilities are far more likely to be contributing their abilities and their intellects to their communities . And the world gets something back . Not to sound like a Pollyanna , but as a therapist , my MS has given me insights into the human spirit I could n't have imagined before dealing with this disease . Of course , if they found a cure tomorrow , I would take it . After all , I 'd still have the insights .
