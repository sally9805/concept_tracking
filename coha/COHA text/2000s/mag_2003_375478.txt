Republican Congressman Darrell Issa has been accused of trying to steal an election with his recall campaign against embattled California Governor Gray Davis . Now , as first reported in the San Francisco Chronicle , it has emerged that Issa was arrested in 1980 for allegedly trying to steal his own car . <P> Court documents contend that Issa , then 27 , reported that his cherry-red Mercedes had been stolen from an airport parking lot though he knew that his brother had just sold the car to a dealer in San Jose for $16,000 on Dec. 28 , 1979 . The charges were ultimately dropped . Issa now says his brother " was a car thief " and denies any personal wrongdoing . " It was illogical to think that I would , in effect , steal my own car , " Issa said in a statement last week . <P> He went on to become a multimillionaire by selling  --  yes  --  car alarms and is using his fortune to fund an anti-Davis campaign across the state , paying signature gatherers $1 for every name they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election officials say Issa has so far submitted 376,008 names of the 897,158 required by law , and he shows no sign of slowing down , despite the stolen-car story . <P> Both Democrats and Republicans believe that a recall vote against Davis is inevitable  --  either in the fall or next March  --  and with Davis scoring as low as 21% in some polls , Republicans realize they have a chance to win back the country 's most visible governorship . Issa may be too conservative ( and abrasive ) to win statewide office , but former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan tells TIME that he and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger , both moderates , have talked about running against Davis . Schwarzenegger is n't discussing politics while he promotes Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines , which opens this week , but , says Riordan , " Davis ' big worry is that it will be me or Arnold . I hope it 's Arnold . " Woe to the man who would try to steal his Hummer.  --  By Terry McCarthy        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
