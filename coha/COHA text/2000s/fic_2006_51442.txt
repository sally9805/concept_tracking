Mike Shultz 's previous stones for us include " Refried Clichs " and " Old as Books . " For this new one , he has drawn upon his own experiences as a high school teacher , but he assures us that he has only broken a student 's arm a few times and he has never eaten a student teacher . That 's his story and he 's sticking to it . <p> BOARSNOUT SPINESNAPPER was having a devil of a time getting the twenty little goblins in his third period math class to understand their nine times-tables . Well , seventeen goblins and three humans , he corrected himself . Something he had n't gotten used to since the war ended and integration began . He took a deep breath and looked out over the room full of shouting , clawing students , all eager to answer his last question . If the next goblin did n't get it , Boar swore he 'd eat him for lunch . <p> The yellow-haired human boy , Suhz-Eat ( or however it was pronounced - human names were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some human method of wanting to be called upon , but he decided against letting him try . Humans were terrible at math , and his principal had made a point of telling the teachers to treat humans with respect . Boar did n't want to embarrass the poor boy . <p> " Pigface ? " Boar said , calling on his favorite student , a clever young goblinette with dung-beads dangling from her ear hairs . <p> " Mr. Spinesnapper , could you repeat the question ? " <p> He approached and grabbed her by the ear , shouting into it . " What is eight times nine ? " <p> " Thanks , " she said , smiling up at him . She had requested that he yell in her ears , and she always liked when he remembered . Boar did n't mind - anything to make a goblin feel special . That was why he taught . <p> " Well , then ? Eight times nine . " <p> " Eighty-nine ! " Pigface shouted . <p> The room erupted into chaos , some students cheering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forcefully . <p> " Nope , " Boar said . He was getting upset . Trouble computing eight times three , he 'd understand - goblins of this age were notoriously dimwitted with their three times-tables . But nines were easy . <p> Stab Farpisser in the front raw pounded on his desk , shouting , but Boar could n't hear him over the noise . <p> " Yes , Stab ? You have to scream it . " Something he should have known by now . A class troublemaker , Stab never followed the rules . <p> The other kids saw the exchange , though , and quieted down . They liked Stab and wanted to hear what wisecrack he might come out with . <p> Stab stared at Boar with one bulbous yellow eye , keeping his other two on his classmates to see their reaction . <p> " When are we ever going to use this stuff , Mr. Spinesnapper ? " <p> " Yeah ! Anyway ! " another goblin called . Then they all joined in . <p> " This stuff is fewmets ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yeah , teach us about thumbscrews ! Something we 'll actually use ! " <p> Boar was about to praise them for their fine independent thinking when he noticed the human boy 's face . Little Suhz-Eat looked petrified . <p> " Suhz-Eat , is everything okay ? " <p> Suhz-Eat froze in his seat , his puny hands grasping the edges of his desk . He nodded vigorously . <p> " And my name is Suzette , " he said in a trembling voice . <p> " Oh , sorry . I was going by the spelling on my class roster . Do you know the answer ? " <p> Suzette paused and then shook his head . Boar heard a few snickers around the room , and someone shouted " Dumb human . " Unfortunately , Boar did n't see who . His principal said something at the last faculty meeting about goblins bullying humans . Boar was n't going to tolerate that kind of garbage in his classroom . <p> " Maybe I need to explain it in a way that you can relate to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If he could get Suzette to give the right answer , they 'd try harder . If a human could do it , they 'd realize that they should be able to , as well . <p> " Suppose you just won a battle , and you 're taking spoils , " he said , looking especially at Suzette . " What are you going to do ? " <p> Nearly everyone clamored to give the answer ; to his disappointment , Suzette was n't among them . And it was such an easy question . <p> " Eat their fingers , " Pigface said . " Especially if they were human . " <p> Everyone laughed . Boar , like every goblin , loved human fingers . Unfortunately , they 'd been hard to get ever since the treaty . <p> " Yes . But how many fingers will you eat from each human ? " <p> " Nine ! " Stab called . <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because you always leave a middle finger on one hand for good luck , Pigface chimed in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eight humans . How many fingers in all would that - " <p> That 's when the sound started . Boar stopped mid-sentence . Green warty heads turned this way and that , seeking the source . <p> " All right , " Boar said , trying not to sound alarmed . " Who 's crying ? " <p> No one answered . Boar 's worry grew , knowing that crying indicated mental disability or severe emotional problems . <p> " Tell me right now , or I 'll break all your arms ! " <p> " Mr. Spinesnapper , " Stab said , " it 's Suzette . The human . " <p> Boar looked . Suzette sank down into his seat and hid his face with a scroll , but sure enough , tears were streaming down his cheeks . In fact , all three humans in the room looked ready to bawl . It did n't make sense . <p> " Suzette ? " Boar said , rushing over to him . <p> " Hey ! Not fair ! " Pigface said . " He gets all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's faking it ! " <p> Boar stopped long enough to bite off a piece of Pigface 's ear as he passed her desk . That would teach her . Pigface humpfed and fingered the wound . <p> Oddly , Suzette looked horrified at Boar 's mild discipline . <p> " What 's wrong ? " Boar said , reaching him and kneeling at his side . " Are you feeling sick ? " <p> Suzette looked at him with both of his wide , frightened eyes . Maybe that 's why they were constantly so scared , Boar thought . Goblins always kept an eye or two askance to watch out for danger . Humans only had two eyes , and they seemed to be stuck always looking at the same thing . That would have to make them a little jumpy , endlessly worrying about something sneaking up on them . <p> " Listen , " Boar whispered . " I know it was a hard question . How about I give you the answer ? " <p> Boar leaned over and whispered " seventy-two " in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what was so scary about seventytwo . He returned to the front of the room . <p> " Well , Suzette , what 's eight times nine ? " <p> All eyes were on him . <p> " Seventy-two , " he mumbled , lips quivering . <p> " Yes ! Great thinking ! " <p> " Mr. Spinesnapper told him , " someone whispered . <p> For a moment , there was silence . Then , Pigface burst out crying . Soon , the whole class was sobbing hysterically . Boar went up and down the rows , breaking arms and boxing ears . He bit off Pigface 's ear again ; it had regenerated already , and she needed correction . All of this was her fault . <p> But by the time he got them to stop , the gong rang . They all abruptly stopped crying and ran out of the room , headed to their next class . <p> The elf-mail delivery came at the end of the day , when Boar was getting ready to go home . He patted the elf on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> EMERGENCY FACULTY MEETING . FOR FACULTY . AFTER SCHOOL . DUE TO EMERGENCY . IF YOU DID NOT READ THIS MESSAGE . READ IT AGAIN . <p> Boar sighed . Another mind-numbing meeting . He was so exhausted . <p> On the way to the Faculty Room , he bumped into Singbad Sharptusk , the biology teacher . She smelled like cat scat , probably from some experiment she was doing with her classes . Boar loved the smell , but he did n't love the way Singbad was always trying to mate with him . She rubbed up against him as they walked . <p> " Hey , Boar , hear about today 's scandal ? " <p> " No , what ? " <p> " Some teacher scared a human kid half to death . Gon na be some body parts flying at the meeting today . Mr. Thunderballs is seriously pissed . " <p> Boar felt his throat constrict . It could n't have been him , could it ? Thunderballs would eat him alive . <p> " Did n't hear about that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity and respect crap , " Singbad said , rolling her eyes . " But most of us are smart enough to play along . I wonder what moron did it ? " <p> " I wonder , too . " Boar also wondered if it was too late to flee the building . The thing was , he actually believed in diversity and respect . Yes , humans were a little slow , and smelled something awful . He did n't really understand them . But deep down inside , he knew they were goblins just like him . He hated the way Singbad mocked the idea of treating them equally . Boar wanted to confront her about it , but they arrived at the Faculty Room before he found the courage . It was hard to argue with prejudiced people , and a little scary - they 'd turn on you in the snapping of a kitten 's neck . <p> The room was nearly full . As the last few teachers filed in and sat , Principal Thunderballs took the podium . Everyone fell silent . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our very own staff treated one of our students with insuffusable indignity . " <p> Gasps arose from the assembled teachers . <p> " Rip his arms off ! " the history teacher called . <p> " Boil him alive ! " <p> " Tear his spine out ! " <p> That one hit too close to the mark . Boar slumped down into his chair , wondering if this was how Suzette felt in his class . <p> " How many times have I told you , this is a new era ? " Thunderballs continued . " Humans are a part of goblin society , now , like it or not . " <p> " It was a human ? " <p> " That 's terrible ! " <p> But not every goblin liked humans . <p> " A human ? Who cares ? " someone called out . <p> " Who said that ? " Thunderballs bellowed . <p> " Him . " Someone pushed forward a young goblin with orange hair and bright red eyes . Boar did n't know him . <p> Singbad leaned over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't me , " the student teacher said , suddenly afraid . <p> Mr. Thunderballs strode into the crowd . Teachers snatched back their chairs , clearing a path for him . <p> " I did n't say it ! " <p> At the last second , the student teacher turned and ran . But Thunderballs had n't won his position by being slow and weak . He snatched the student teacher by the hair and lifted him off the ground , his feet kicking wildly . <p> " This is what happens to the next teacher who indignifies a human ! " Thunderballs cried . <p> With a smooth , easy motion , he tore the student teacher 's arms off and tossed them to the crowd . <p> The room erupted into chaos as teachers scrambled for the morsels . His legs came next , and then the rest of him . His liver landed between Boar and Singbad , and Boar half-heartedly wrestled her for it , eventually letting her take it all . She quickly gulped it down . <p> " What 's wrong ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Indigestion ? " <p> " Something like that , " Boar said . <p> Thunderballs returned to the podium . <p> " Here 's our action plan . Because of this one person , this one bigoted goblin among us , we 're going to spend the next six hours in a special seminar : ' Goblins and Humans , Chained in Love . ' " <p> Moans and complaints filled the room . <p> " Enough ! " Thunderballs shouted . " Remember , if it were n't for this one monster among us - " Thunderballs swept his gaze around the room , locking his middle eye momentarily and menacingly on Boar . " - Then you could be home by now , eating dirt from between your spouse 's toes . But you 'll have to save that pleasure for tomorrow night . " <p> Boar almost did n't hear him . He clutched his shoulders tight to his body , picturing the poor student teacher . If his colleagues found out it was his fault , he 'd be their next after-school snack . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the student teacher . After the break , and a minor brawl between the secretary and the wrestling coach , the seminar began . Thunderballs divided them into " action groups " and gave them skull-holders filled with scrolls , instructing everyone to read them . <p> Singbad , by rosy bad luck , was in Boar 's group . <p> " Listen to this one , " she said . " It says only point zero one percent of all humans can read . And one hundred and three percent come from households below the median income level . " <p> " Um-hmm , " Boar replied . He was making a show of reading the scrolls , in case Thunderballs saw him , but he could n't concentrate . <p> Had he really scared Suzette ? Boar was willing to accept responsibility ; the problem was , he could n't figure out what he 'd done wrong . Maybe he needed this seminar , after all . He looked up at the podium , hoping to see Thunderballs . Their principal was n't the brightest goblin around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Surely he possessed some wisdom about humans that he could pass along . <p> But Thunderballs was n't there . <p> A strong , warty hand fell on Boar 's shoulder , nearly knocking him out of his seat . <p> " Looking for me ? " <p> Boar quickly got to his feet and turned , looking up . Thunderballs was easily two feet taller . <p> " No , sir . " He had to stand his ground or risk being eaten . <p> " So , Spinesnapper . How many B-PAOT 's do you have ? " <p> Boar did n't like where this was going . <p> " Three . " <p> " Takes five to be tenurized , right ? " <p> Boar nodded . He always tried his best , but Bailing the Principal 's Ass Out of Trouble was difficult . It meant passing a kid when his parents complained , even if the kid learned nothing . Or not busting a kid for Selling giggleweed if her father was on the school board . <p> " That student teacher was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting the point . If Thunderballs tried to tear apart a tenured teacher , the Union would jump him , and they would have a free-for-all . The building would be sacked , and Thunderballs would find his head on a spit , turning slowly over a fire in the faculty lounge . But until Boar earned two more B-PAOT 's , he was fair game . <p> " I see that you understand . " Thunderballs poked him in the chest with a clawed finger , drawing blood . " You 'd better pay really good attention to this seminar . I 'm going to be watching you , and expecting improvements in your classroom . " <p> With that , Thunderballs strode calmly to the podium . Boar had n't realized he 'd been holding his breath . He released it and fell into his chair . <p> " What was all that about ? " Singbad said . <p> " Shhh , " Boar replied . " Pay attention . " He pointed to the front . <p> " Let us begin , " Thunderballs said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Say it for me . " <p> " No Goblin Left With a Mind , " they said in unison . <p> " Yes . Our government wants mindless goblins capable only of regurgitizing memorized information . On the surface , that 's what we must seem to produce . But we still value real teaching around here , do n't we ? " <p> " Absolutely ! " someone called . <p> " Right . We must help our students think independently while giving them the capacity to appear mindless . You ca n't survive in today 's world without the ability to turn off your brain . But we 're going to sneak some independent thinking into the curriculum , and that means breaking away from old prejudices . We 'll start with a discussion on false stereotypes about humans . Any ideas out there ? " <p> " They treat their females like second-class citizens , " Singbad called out , her tone scornful . <p> " Well , that one 's true . I 'm looking for false ones here . " <p> " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excellent ! " Thunderballs said . " But let 's phrase these in a more dignifying way : ' It 's not true that they 're all stupid . ' A recent study showed that at least one human in a thousand is intelligent . Anyone else ? " <p> " They are n't all clumsy . " <p> " Or ugly . " <p> " Right ! " Thunderballs said . <p> " They do n't all taste good . " <p> " Exactly ! " Thunderballs said . " I remember one time when I was sucking marrow from a human thighbone after a battle , and .... " He trailed off . " Well , you understand . We all need to be on guard against these insidulous thoughts . Now , I have an activity planned . It 's called the Chain of Love , and was the inspiration for the title of this seminar . " <p> He reached down beneath the podium and retrieved a stack of miniature scrolls . <p> " This is going to make you all more diversity-minded . You 'll each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example ... " He opened a scroll . " ' Find someone who knows why humans eat weeds . ' If you get this scroll , you must find a fellow teacher who knows the answer and join hands . And someone will find you , as long as you can answer their question , and you 'll join hands , and eventually we 'll have the Chain of Love . Miss Burngossip , please distribute the scrolls . " <p> Miss Burngossip , Thunderball 's voluptuous secretary , handed them out , and soon everyone was milling around the noisy room , searching for answers . <p> Boar 's table got their scrolls last . With no small trepidation , he opened his . FIND SOMEONE . WHO HAS SEEN . A HUMAN 'S BELLY BUTTON . <p> Boar nearly choked . Surely Thunderballs gave this one to him intentionally , just to see him fail . He 'd seen zillions of goblin bellybuttons , but humans wore " clothing , " and their belly buttons were always covered . In fact , they 'd been warned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school rule that neither students nor teachers were allowed to tear them off . <p> Dejected , Boar nonetheless called out , " Anyone seen a human belly button ? Belly button , anyone ? Belly button ? " <p> Most of the chain was already formed when Boar , to his delight , found Ms. Spittletongue , a phys. ed. teacher who once accidentally spied a human 's navel during a game of Head Smashers . This Chain of Love was n't so bad after all ! Now , if only someone asked him a question he knew the answer to .... <p> " Hey , Boar , should 've tried you from the beginning , " Singbad said , hurrying up to him with her scroll in hand . " No one else can do this one . Can you correctly pronounce and spell two human names ? " <p> Boar perked up . " Yes ! I just learned a new one today ! " <p> Suddenly , he realized that everyone was looking at him . This was the last gap in the chain . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The pressure was on , but Boar was confident . He 'd show Thunderballs exactly how good a teacher he was . <p> " Suzette , " he said , spelling it out . " A friendly little human boy in my class . And John . Rhymes with pond , if pond did n't have a ' D. ' " <p> " Spell it , " Thunderballs said . <p> " J-O-H-N . " <p> The room erupted in laughter . <p> " Sorry , Spinesnapper , " Thunderballs said . " Any idiot knows there 's no ' H. ' " <p> " Yes , there is . You know how humans spell things in such weird - " <p> Gasps . <p> " A stereotype ! " <p> " He 's prejudiced ! " <p> " He 's the one ! " <p> Boar 's head dropped . They 'd discovered him . He glanced at Singbad , but even she averted two of her eyes in embarrassment . <p> " Yes , esteemed faculty , " Thunderballs announced . " The culprit has revealed himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Boar , you did n't ! " <p> " Let 's eat him ! " <p> " Just a minute , " Thunderballs said . " We ate a math teacher last week , and he 's still regrowing in the vat . I 'm going to give Mr. Spinesnapper another chance . " <p> He looked directly at Boar . <p> " Tomorrow , I 'll observe his third-period class . If he has n't eliminated all prejudice by the end of the period , and see to it that every goblin in the room wants to be Suzette 's best friend ... " Thunderballs grinned rows of sharp teeth . " We feast on Spinesnapper . " <p> As the meeting dismissed , Boar slunk quietly out the back . This was it , then . His career , not to mention his life , was over . He could convince a few of his students to be nicer to Suzette . But all of them ? And little monsters like Stab ? <p> Impossible . He might as well spread pixie-jam on himself so they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , at least he could visit Suzette 's parents and apologize , maybe even offer to help him with his homework . Perhaps they 'd put in a good word with Thunderballs . <p> Otherwise , he was goblin grub . <p> HALFWAY through third period the next morning , Boar was sweating flagons . <p> It started terribly . Mr. Thunderballs came in and addressed the class , telling them how horribly they and their teacher had treated Suzette . Boar immediately saw the speech 's effects : His students glared resentfully at Suzette for getting them in trouble . Even Suzette reacted with visible annoyance - he saw their glares and knew what caused them . That quick , all the good Boar had accomplished the night before by visiting the boy 's home unraveled . <p> He had managed to clear up the trouble from yesterday with them , though . Apparently , the example about eating human fingers frightened Suzette . And upon reflection , that made sense . Humans did n't regenerate . On his walk home , Boar chastised himself repeatedly for being so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Well , he 'd stayed up all last night preparing , and it was time to unleash his master plan . Thankfully , his class was sympathetic to his plight , trying to help him look good in front of the principal . Students , as always , turned against the highest authority figure in the room . But sometimes his students ' version of " help " was n't in line with his own . <p> " Class , we 're going to play a game , " he told them . <p> They cheered wildly . Stab pounded so hard on his desk that it cracked , and his next blow broke it in half . In the back of the room , Thunderballs shook his head and wrote something on his scroll . <p> " It 's called ' Chain of Love . ' What happens is I give you a little scroll .... " <p> They loved it , even the humans . But just as the chain neared completion and Thunderballs was looking pleasantly surprised , Boar heard hushed whispers cutting through the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students around Suzette . <p> He was crying . <p> If Thunderballs saw Suzette 's tears , Boar was dead meat . <p> " We just wanted to see his belly button , " Pigface said . <p> Boar kept one eye on Thunderballs and studied Pigface closely with the other two . Mischief capered in her innocent expression . Was she jealous of all the attention Suzette was getting ? <p> Boar pushed into the throng . If they remained where they were , standing in the way , Thunderballs would n't see Suzette . Now to get him to stop crying . <p> " Suzette , what happened ? " <p> " He tried to take my clothes off . " <p> " Who ? " <p> " Him ! " He pointed at Pigface . <p> " Pigface is a girl , " Stab said . <p> " Hush , Stab . Listen , Suzette . These guys did n't grow up with clothes . They did n't know that you never take them off . But they do now , right ? " <p> Boar glared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " That 's stupid , " she said . <p> Boar reached out and grabbed her dung-dangled ear . <p> " Maybe you did n't hear me , " he said . <p> But the chastised goblins were returning to the game , and Suzette was still sniffling . Thunderballs would see her . <p> Thinking quick , he turned to Stab . <p> " Stab , I need your help . " <p> " Me ? " he said , dumbstruck but pleased . " Anything . " <p> Boar hoped he was n't making a gigantic mistake . " Go out in the hall and run back and forth , shouting . Then bang on the door and scream ' Thunderballs rots ! ' or something . " <p> " Why would you want me to .... " He cast a stealthy eye at Thunderballs , who was scribbling in his scroll . " Oh , I get it . Sure thing , Mr. Spinesnapper . " <p> Boar stepped in front of Suzette as Stab left the room . A moment later , the class heard his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinges . <p> " Thunderballs drinks milk for breakfast ! " Stab shouted from the hall . " Thunderballs drinks milk ! " <p> Then his footsteps crashed away down the hall . <p> Thunderballs was furious . <p> " Was that your student ? " he said . <p> " I do n't know , " Boar replied . " You 'd better catch him , sir . I would , but I 'm running a class here , trying to teach diversity . " <p> His eyes narrowed . " I 'll be back , " he said , storming out . <p> Quickly , Boar turned to Suzette . <p> " It 's going to be all right , " he said . " Do you remember what we talked about last night ? " <p> He nodded . <p> " Well , it 's just like I said . Goblins respect toughness . Next time Pigface does something you do n't like , poke one of her eyes out . " <p> His brow crinkled in consternation . " But that 's horrible ! " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in no time . " <p> " But then she 'll eat my fingers . She told me so yesterday after class . " Suzette wiped a lingering tear from his cheek . <p> " No . She 'll think you 're cool for standing up to her . Now , I 've had enough of this Chain of Love . Why do n't you get back to your seat ? " <p> By the time Thunderballs returned , a battered Stab in hand , Boar was passing out math scrolls . Stab grinned and gave Boar a conspiratorial wink as he sat down . <p> " Mr. Thunderballs , a copy for you , too , so you can follow along , " Boar said . Principals liked things like that . <p> " Okay , Stab , why do n't you do number one for us . " <p> " Nine times eight is seventy-two , " he said . " I remember that from yesterday . " <p> " Do n't we all . " Boar continued asking questions , giving the humans as many chances as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . He 'd drilled Suzette on her times tables the previous night . <p> " Suzette , how about the next one ? " <p> He looked down at the scroll in his hand and gulped . <p> " You gave him the hardest one , " Stab said , sounding surprised . <p> And indeed it was . Nineteen times three . Why had n't he scratched that one off ? Not only did it involve a two-digit number ; it also involved the dreaded threes , and they had n't practiced those . <p> At the back of the room , Thunderballs grinned . Boar could n't skip the question . If only he had n't given him a copy ! <p> " If you need time to - " Boar started to say . <p> " Fifty-seven ! " Suzette said . <p> " Correct ! " Boar shouted , ecstatic . <p> " Whoa , " Stab said . " He 's smart . " <p> " Oh , yeah ? " Pigface said . " How 'd you know the answer , human ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . " He met Pigface 's three-eyed glare . " I just pictured how many it would be if I poked out the eyes of every goblin in this room . " <p> For a moment , the room was silent . Then Stab stood up and said , " Suzette , you are the coolest goblin I know ! " He threw back his head and laughed like a wild hyena . <p> " Let 's try it ! " Gurgle Nosepicker shouted . <p> " Yeah ! Poke out someone 's eyes ! " <p> " Okay , okay ! " Boar said , " fust one person , though , to illustrate the idea . " <p> " Me ! Me ! " <p> " No , me ! " <p> Boar pointed at Stab . " You 're up . But you must promise to listen carefully to the rest of the lesson until your eyes heal , and do n't puke on your scroll when they first start to grow back and you get dizzy . " <p> " I promise ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the poking ? Suzette , would you like to do the honors ? " <p> Suzette 's face whitened and he shook his head . " No thanks , Mr. Spinesnapper . But Pigface could do it if she wants . " <p> " Really ? " Pigface said to Suzette . " You do n't mind ? " <p> " No . Please . You do it . " <p> Pigface smiled . " You know , human , you 're not so bad after all . " She went over to Stab and tackled him to the floor , gouging at his face with her claws . The class converged on the flailing bodies . <p> Boar met Thunderballs 's gaze across the room . It seemed to say , " You 're off the hook - this time . " Then he stalked out . <p> When the eye-poking was done and the class returned to their seats , Stab raised his hand . Boar was impressed that he 'd picked up the human gesture from Suzette . <p> " Mr. Spinesnapper , " Stab said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore ? With us liking humans better and all ? " <p> " I hope so . Now , let 's get back to math . " <p> He was about to continue when Pigface 's hand shot up . <p> " Yes , Pigface ? " <p> " One more question . " She glanced at Suzette , grinning . " Does this mean we can eat his fingers ? " <p> IMG
