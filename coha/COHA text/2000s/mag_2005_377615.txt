A bobcat regularly saunters up the arroyo leading to Paul and Carolyn Zeiger 's desert property in Pima County , Ariz. , and leaps onto the flat roof of their adobe-style house . As long as their pet terrier , Stella , is inside , they do n't worry much . " The bobcat jumps around up there and takes care of the mice , " says Carolyn , 61 , a clinical psychologist from Boulder , Colo . The Zeigers also get the occasional rattlesnake on their porch , and in the summer they have to stay indoors to avoid the midday heat . But despite those inconveniences  --  and in part because of them  --  they have developed a deep love of the desert in the five years since they moved here . Twenty miles from Tucson , their house looks out on a plain of saguaro cacti stretching to the Rincon Mountains . At night the stars shine brightly without competition from human lighting . Paul , 68 , a semiretired software developer , gets all the hiking and bike riding he wants , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their yard . " You have to learn to adjust in the desert , " says Carolyn . <P> It 's an adjustment a lot of folks have been making of late . Since 1950 , the population of Arizona , New Mexico and Nevada has increased from 1.6 million to 10 million as Americans discover the desert 's clean air , warm weather , open spaces and relatively affordable housing . But without zoning codes to restrict it , much of that growth has been distressingly haphazard . By the time the Zeigers began looking for a retirement home in the 1990s , what they found was a lot of strip malls , golf clubs and sprawling subdivisions decorated here and there with cactus plants . They were horrified . " We did n't want to move to a place where they are just screwing up the desert again , " says Carolyn . <P> One exception , they discovered , was Pima County , which covers 9,186 sq . mi. of southern Arizona , including the city of Tucson . Pima has developed a conservation plan that permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a template for communities across the Southwest . " The old debate about whether growth is good or bad is irrelevant , " says Chuck Huckelberry , Pima County administrator . " We have been growing for 50 years in Tucson . But we control where our growth occurs so it maximizes benefits and minimizes impacts . " <P> There 's a lot of growth to control . From 1990 to 2003 , Arizona 's population increased 53% , making it the second fastest growing state in the nation , after Nevada ( another desert state , whose population grew 87% in the same period ) . Developers working in the U.S. 's four major deserts  --  California 's Mojave , Arizona 's Sonoran , Texas and New Mexico 's Chihuahuan and Nevada and Utah 's Great Basin  --  ca n't build houses fast enough . In the town of La Quinta , Calif. , southeast of Palm Springs , property prices jumped 48% last year , and new-home buyers have to go on waiting lists or hope to win a developer 's lottery for the right to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
