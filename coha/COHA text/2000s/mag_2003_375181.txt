For Scott Schlageter , 35 , an American procurement manager for the Saudi air force , it was just another expat 's night in Riyadh . He was watching an Antonio Banderas thriller , curled up on the sofa in his home in al-Jadawel , a gated town-house complex in the Saudi Arabian capital . Suddenly the lights died , and the TV zapped off . Schlageter saw a flash and felt a thundering explosion that blew out all his windows . " I grabbed my cell phone , went upstairs to a secure room , called the U.S. embassy and told them we were under attack , " he says . A vehicle loaded with explosives had blown up at the gates of the compound . <P> At that very moment , similar assaults were under way in two other residential areas . Four miles away , at a complex that housed dozens of Americans employed by Vinnell Corp . to help train the Saudi National Guard , a pair of cars were on a deadly mission . The first , a Ford Crown Victoria sedan filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the compound 's security checkpoint . The men mowed down the guards and removed a 3-ft. - high steel barrier <P> that protected the compound . The second vehicle , a Dodge pickup loaded with explosives , followed close behind . It barreled into a central area and exploded between two five-story buildings . At the nearby al-Hamra complex , two other explosives-laden vehicles were detonated near a pool where a party was in progress . By the time the smoke cleared from the three assaults last Monday , 34 were dead , and 200 more were wounded . The dead included nine Americans and nine of the assassins . <P> Terror struck again just four days later . In the Moroccan city of Casablanca , five suicide bombers hit within 20 minutes of one another , spreading death and destruction across an array of targets : a Spanish social club , a hotel , a Jewish community center and cemetery , a restaurant next to Belgium 's consulate . Nearly half of the 41 who lost their lives had been at the club , Casa d'Espana , where two suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within a day , Moroccan authorities had rounded up a number of Islamic militants and had in custody one man who had been detained before his bomb exploded . More attacks seemed likely , and both the State Department and the British government warned people to stay away from East Africa . <P> Before Riyadh and Casablanca , it was tempting , if just for a moment , to believe that the war on terrorism was going well , that the big picture was of one success after another . The U.S. had notched a quick victory in Iraq , deposing a regime the Administration had linked to extremist Islamic terrorists . The much feared retaliatory strikes did n't take place , and no attacks had hit the U.S. after Sept. 11 , 2001 . Several key leaders of al-Qaeda , the network headed by Osama bin Laden that carried out the Sept. 11 attacks , had been arrested . Just days before the bombings in Riyadh , President Bush stood on the deck of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln to bask in his Iraq triumph and declared , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not endless . We do not know the day of final victory , but we have seen the turning of the tide . "
