How careless can an intelligence chief be ? JOHN DEUTCH , former CIA director , seems to have been very careless indeed . In 1995 and 1996 he shunned a secure CIA computer , opting to compose 74 documents containing highly classified information , including memos to the President and Cabinet members , on an unsecure Macintosh at his home . Worse , he used the same computer for personal e-mail , receiving a note from a former Russian citizen living in Western Europe . Deutch family members also surfed the Web on it ; one visited porn sites . <P> Now Deutch 's successor and onetime protege , George Tenet , and other agency underlings are accused of mishandling the matter once it came to light . An inspector general 's report , leaked last week to the New York Times , concludes that Tenet and his colleagues took actions that delayed the investigation . Those close to the probe say it was n't a cover-up  --  rather that Tenet et al . were concerned about protecting the Deutch family 's privacy . But Senate Intelligence Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Deutch got special treatment from Tenet and others . Tenet suspended Deutch 's CIA security clearance last August but has not revoked it . Deutch retains clearance at the Pentagon . <P>  --  By Massimo Calabresi/Washington
