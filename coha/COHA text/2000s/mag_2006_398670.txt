Section : Health for Life FROM HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL An experimental treatment offers promise for some patients whose depression resists standard medications and shock therapy . <p> Anne and mark ( not their real names ) could never have guessed that their lives would be saved by magnetism . Both had suffered at least a year of disabling depression . Numerous psychiatric treatments failed to provide longed-for relief . Life was miserable until they began receiving an experimental treatment with a clumsy name : repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation , or repetitive TMS . <p> This magnetism has nothing to do with magnets applied to the skin or with animal magnetism , the charlatanry invented by Franz Mesmer in the 19th century , although skeptics have worried that people cured by repetitive TMS have merely been mesmerized . Repetitive TMS uses real magnetic fields to induce changes in brain function , and there 's some evidence it may make nerve-cell connections more efficient . It may modify how regions of the brain work together to regulate mood . It 's a cousin of " shock therapy , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does not require anesthesia . It 's localized , so side effects have been mild ; some patients experience headache or scalp discomfort . <p> TMS was developed more than 20 years ago by neurologists studying brain function , rather than treatment . The technique exploits the relationship between electric currents and magnetic fields . When an electric current in a wire changes , it creates a magnetic field . That magnetic field can create an electrical current in another wire . In repetitive TMS , a coil that is shaped , for example , like a doughnut or figure-8 is held over the scalp . By rapidly changing the charge in the coil , the magnetic field induces an electric current in the brain that is strong enough to activate nerve cells below the scalp . The coil may look large , but the area affected can be as small as a pea . In contrast , ECT causes a generalized or whole-brain seizure , with electrical changes throughout the brain . <p> This modicum of intrusiveness appealed to Mark . One day when he was 15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he went to a nearby bridge instead , planning to jump . Police rescued him . Two years of repeated hospitalization , medication and psychotherapy did not help ; so he began ECT . It worked , but he required monthly maintenance treatments that were embarrassing and disruptive because he could not function well in the days around the periodic treatments . <p> Mark 's mother found out about repetitive TMS from a news report almost 10 years ago when he was 17 . She tracked down Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone of the Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston . Within two weeks of treatment he received as part of a study , Mark developed a more positive outlook . He has needed maintenance treatment every four months or so , but it has not interfered with intellectual functioning the way ECT did . He finished high school , and earned two college degrees in education . Now he 's a teaching assistant , optimistic that he will realize his goal of being a teacher . <p> Is Mark 's success story unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with hard-to-treat depression . Such sufferers commonly cycle through many treatments before they find the one that helps . Trial-and-error is the state of the art , since no one can predict which treatment will work for a given patient . The question for researchers  --  and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , which is reviewing its status  --  is whether repetitive TMS should join antidepressants and ECT as an approved treatment for depression . <p> In early experiments , data were inconsistent , partly because there were no guidelines . Repetitive TMS treatment varies depending on the part of the brain targeted , the precision of the targeting , the intensity of the signal and the number of cycles per second , among other factors . <p> Individuality should be celebrated , but it makes research more difficult : subjects in depression studies are never a uniform group . As we learn more about the brain , we hope to know which people have which kind of depression . One day , measurements of brain activity may also help guide how and precisely where to administer repetitive TMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict how many and which people might respond to repetitive TMS or any other therapy . <p> Despite the problems , recent results are encouraging . Most studies involve patients who have n't been helped by anything else and are therefore less likely than average to feel improvement . Yet as practitioners refine their methods , they seem to be getting better results . In one randomized controlled study of almost 70 patients based in the state of Washington , subjects were given either repetitive TMS or a sham ( placebo ) treatment . In the repetitive TMS group , about 30 percent had a significant response and 20 percent had a complete remission ( compared with 6 percent and 3 percent in the sham group ) . In Australia , 50 patients were assigned either to repetitive TMS or sham treatment . A significant response was seen in 44 percent of patients receiving repetitive TMS ( 8 percent in the sham group ) . More than a third in the repetitive TMS group had a complete remission , compared with none in the sham group . <p> Success in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given . Patients are now receiving stimuli of higher intensity , a larger number of stimuli in each repetitive TMS session and more stimulation sessions . And in the Australian study , patients had both the left and the right sides of the brain treated . Researchers note , however , that it is harder to create a placebo condition for repetitive TMS . The researchers know which treatment they are giving , and often the patients can tell the difference , too . <p> In fact , Anne entered one of Dr. Pascual-Leone 's trials almost 10 years ago and anticipated that she might receive the sham treatment . But she knew right away that she had been placed in the repetitive TMS group . She felt a characteristic head tapping and twitching in her face that she now knows so well that she can tell the technicians when they have focused on the wrong spot . Her mood improved after the first treatment . At the end of the two-week course , she was dramatically better . <p> Anne had been expecting twins in a pregnancy that became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her daughter remained in a precarious state in the hospital for four months . Grief and worry led to postpartum depression and hallucinatory psychosis . Anne could barely function . She tried antidepressants , but felt no better until receiving repetitive TMS . In the last few years , she has had short courses of repetitive TMS about four times a year . She now works in a business with her husband , takes care of her children and describes herself as becoming what she was before she became depressed : a happy person . <p> The stories of Anne and Mark are stirring , but experts are still quite cautious . A relatively small number of patients have been treated so far , and the number of patients evaluated in controlled trials is also very limited . The maximum period of benefit averages around four months , at which point maintenance treatment can be offered and seems to work well . Though less intrusive than ECT , the treatment does require a complicated machine that has to be operated by a skilled technician in a controlled environment . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expensive and less convenient . There is also much to learn about how repetitive TMS interacts with standard drug treatments . <p> Repetitive TMS is already available for depression treatment in Canada , Australia , New Zealand , Israel and the European Union . The FDA may rule on repetitive TMS as a depression treatment in early 2007 . Approval here would be good for Anne and Mark , because they now pay out of pocket for a treatment that costs about $300 per session . They do n't feel they 've been mesmerized . " If there was going to be a placebo effect , " asked Anne , " could n't it have happened sooner with one of the medications I tried ? " Their interest in talking about their experience is propelled by vivid memories of the pain of depression and the subsequent relief . They know the hard work of living with the illness and the frustration of trial-and-error treatment . They encourage people to stay with it . Like many health-care professionals and patients , they hope depressed patients will have more options available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How Magnetic Therapy Works <p> Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) is being tested as a treatment for multiple neurological and psychiatric disorders , most notably depression . An overview : Effects on the Brain 1 The magnetic field <p> The TMS device , made of coiled wires encased in plastic , emits brief but powerful magnetic pulses that penetrate about one inch into the brain . 2 Stimulating the brain <p> These pulses induce an electric current that causes neurons in the targeted region to fire and to release neurotransmitters that set off additional neurons , thus activating a circuit . 3 Long-term treatment <p> For reasons that are still unclear , prolonged TMS therapy-daily sessions spanning a few weeks , for instance-alters the physiology of the circuits being repeatedly activated . As a result , there is lasting change in the effectiveness of those circuits , and in the brain 's behavior . Brain function <p> The colored regions in the scans below show how brain activity has changed after TMS treatment for depression ; the labeled structures are thought to be involved in mood control . The Findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TMS as a remedy for severe depression experienced relief of at least half their symptoms . 31% of patients in the study experienced relief of virtually all their depression symptoms after nine weeks of continuous TMS treatment . <p> SOURCES : DR .
