Anyone who scanned the headlines last week might be excused for thinking a long-feared biological Rubicon had been crossed . Newspapers across the country , including the Wall Street Journal , USA Today , the Los Angeles Times , the Washington Post and the New York Times , put the story on the front page , and U.S. News &; World Report splashed it on the cover , proclaiming THE FIRST HUMAN CLONE in big , bold type . <P> Pro-life politicians were quick to denounce the experiment . Kansas Senator Sam Brownback , a Republican , vowed to try to get the Senate to approve a bill before Christmas prohibiting human cloning . " The use of embryos to clone is wrong , " declared President George Bush . " We should not as a society grow life to destroy it . " <P> But a closer look at what researchers had actually done makes clear that nobody is anywhere near producing tiny carbon copies of human beings . Scientists at Advanced Cell Technology , a small Massachusetts biotech firm , only managed to grow " embryos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all those died almost immediately . Indeed , says George Seidel , embryologist at Colorado State University , " in terms of their objectives , it was a complete failure . " <P> That may be too harsh . Just getting a human embryo started without the union of sperm and egg was a feat never before achieved . It 's a step , though a small one , in a potentially important direction . <P> Still , by publishing the results at such an early stage  --  and , perhaps more important , by ballyhooing them in the popular press  --  the company may have shot itself in the foot . The blast of publicity may win ACT bragging rights and pull in much needed investment to fuel the company 's research . But if the hoopla triggers a harsh anticloning backlash , it might dash whatever hopes ACT had of actually saving lives . <P> And that 's really what this kind of cloning is about . " Our intention is not to clone human beings , " insists ACT medical director Dr. Robert Lanza . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the so-called starter cells that can turn into any sort of body tissue , from brain to bone to blood . In theory , stem cells might be used to treat any disease in which cell death is a factor : diabetes , Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's disease , paralysis , stroke and more . And while stem cells can be harvested from aborted fetuses , that source is abhorrent to abortion foes  --  which is one reason President Bush declared last summer that only those stem-cell lines already in existence could be studied with government funds . <P> That ban does n't affect ACT , which is privately funded , but stem cells from aborted fetuses are problematic in any case . Like any foreign tissue , they can trigger rejection ; ideally , doctors would prefer to get stem cells from a patient 's own body . The most direct way to do that is through cloning , and ACT scientists took the first steps in that direction by two different techniques . In one , they stimulated an unfertilized egg to begin dividing on its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a donated egg and inserted that of an adult  --  the same method used to produce Dolly the sheep , the world 's first mammalian clone .
