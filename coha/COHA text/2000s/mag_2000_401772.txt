Enjoy the ocean on a deeper level in this picturesque Connecticut village that is magical as its name <p> Weekend visitors and year-round residents agree that Mystic , Connecticut , is as magical as its name suggests . " I moved here three years ago , kicking and screaming , from New York City , " admits an enthusiastic **27;646;TOOLONG . " Now I would n't leave for anything in the world . The place casts a spell . " <p> Much of the allure comes from the past , when the picturesque stretch of New England coastline was home to some of America 's most beautiful clipper ships and the wealthy captains who skippered them . Generations later , townspeople recount local lore with amazing accuracy and colorful detail . They are patriotic to the core , and still gather on the Fourth of July to take turns reading aloud the Declaration of Independence . <p> " The War of 1812 was probably our finest hour , " muses Michael Davis , president of the historical society in nearby Stonington . As if to underscore the pluck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During one battle a cannonball blasted through somebody 's house and was retrieved by the owner , who gave it to the American soldiers , who blasted it right back at the British . " The returned fire did n't end the war , notes another history buff , but it may have launched the recycling movement . <p> Unlike other destinations that attract visitors by recreating and celebrating the past , Mystic , Stonington , and nearby Mystic Seaport stop short of being contrived . The area has its share of pricey boutiques and trendy restaurants with clever names such as G. Williker 's , Go Fish , Mex to the Max , and Thyme and Place , but the businesses are patronized by local residents as well as tourists . <p> " This is not artificial , " says Davis . " Walk our streets , see the wonderful houses , and you 'll be imbued with our history . " <p> Some of the wonderful houses bear markers to alert passersby to famous former owners . Artist James Whistler once lived on a shady street in Stonington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into ( and thus is credited with discovering ) Antarctica while on a seal-hunting sail , occupied a white Greco-Italianate house that is now open for tours . Other , more contemporary celebrities prefer to remain anonymous : writer Peter Benchley ( Jaws ) is quietly expanding his already-oversized summer retreat , and decorating maven Alexandra Stoddard , author of The Decoration of Houses , slips in for long weekends at her perfectly appointed property . <p> The maritime gems of the past are preserved at Mystic Seaport , a 17-acre waterfront museum that is far more than a recreated village of 19th-century New England life . Visitors can amble the grounds and view the largest collection of boats and sea-related photography in the world . The shipyard is a " working " exhibit that offers ongoing demonstrations of the lost art of wooden shipbuilding . The most recent product to slip out of the shipyard and into the Atlantic was the 136-ton reproduction of the freedom schooner Amistad . Launched earlier this year , the ship will cruise the waters of the world and serve as a floating classroom dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the shipboard rebellion that was dramatized in the Spielberg film Amistad . <p> One of the pluses of Mystic Seaport is that it invites frequent visits . Once is not enough . Depending on the time of year , something special is always going on  --  like the October Chowderfest that coincides with the peak of fall foliage season , or the winter lantern-light tours that prompt guests to step into Christmases of the past . A " happening " that promises to be around for many seasons is Voyages : Stories of America and the Sea , the most ambitious exhibition mounted in the museum 's 71-year history . It opened in June after ten years of planning and two years of construction . <p> " We 're stretching out to include items of interest to people who come from places other than New England , " says Stuart Parnes , director of exhibitions . " Our goal with Voyages is to get people to think about how the sea has affected their lives . After all , unless your roots are Native American , your ancestors probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been aboard the Mayflower , or a slave ship , or a boat that docked first at Ellis Island . In contemporary times , the vessel might have been a raft that made the voyage between Cuba and Florida . " <p> The exhibit that Parnes and his staff have mounted covers three floors of space and is separated into seven sections . " Although Voyages is comprised of objects such as maps , paintings , boats , clothing , and videos , it is a story about people rather than things , " says J. Revell Carr , president of Mystic Seaport . The people whose personal stories are depicted in the Voyages exhibit include the Cuedras family , who came from Cuba in 1994 ; Clara Benson , who sailed with her family on a trade mission to Asia in 1872 ; and Theresa Peterson , who makes her living by fishing the cold waters of modern-day Alaska . <p> A visit to Mystic Seaport can easily spill over to a second day , but visitors will want to save at least an afternoon for Mystic Aquarium , located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a recently completed $52 million expansion project , the aquarium now boasts a sprawling outdoor beluga whale display and the Challenge of the Deep exhibit that takes guests thousands of feet beneath the ocean surface in search of marine life and lost ocean liners . And , on the topic of lost liners , the aquarium is also home base for Dr. Robert Ballard , active ocean explorer and discoverer of the Titanic . From here he directs research projects that take him all over the world . <p> If , after enjoying the ocean on a deeper-than-usual level , Mystic visitors want to set sail themselves , a cruise can be arranged . The Argia , a replica of a 19th-century , gaff-rigged schooner , offers full-and half-day adventures at sea . " We even let guests participate in the sailing , " assures the captain . Room at the Inn <p> If you like romance with a Hollywood twist , check into The Inn at Mystic and request Room 8 at the Gate House  --  the honeymoon hideaway of the fabled duo Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if their suite is booked , atmosphere abounds throughout the historic 15-acre property that sits high above Mystic Harbor and Long Island Sound . Wood-burning fireplaces , canopied beds , and arrangements of fresh flowers are standard features , and Mystic 's nearby shopping district is a 20- to 30-minute walk , depending on how fast you travel and how many boutiques you visit along the way . <p> Two of the inn 's more current " stars " are Jody Dyer , innkeeper-owner , and Bill Hall , executive chef . Dyer recruited Hall a year ago from an upscale cruise . ship where he often invited guests to accompany him ashore in search of fresh produce for the evening 's meal . This penchant for healthy cuisine impressed Dyer , who wanted to expand her inn 's menu to include a range of light choices . <p> " He 's totally changed the food concept , " says Dyer . " We now have the ability to alter the menu daily . We use an immense amount of vegetables , and we never begin dinner preparations until late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors are on a day trip ( the Delta Queen cruise line offers Mystic as a shore option ) with no local accommodations needed , they should plan a meal at the inn 's Flood Tide Restaurant . Because special items vary , each evening chef Hall posts the next day 's menu on the inn 's Web site ( www.innatmystic.com. ) for would-be diners to review . <p> Guests in less of a hurry can indulge in everything from kayaking to hiking , and from golf to tennis . For the ultimate treat , Dyer suggests discovering the elegance of a bygone era by arranging a seven-hour chauffeured tour in the inn 's midnight-blue Rolls Royce . The itinerary includes stops at Newport 's lavish mansions , which were built as " summer cottages " for the Vanderbilts and their circle of friends . <p> To get in touch with The Inn at Mystic , call 1-800-237-2415 . <p> A series of 20-foot-long windows at Mystic Aquarium offers below-water viewing of beluga whales , charmers , caves , and hideaways provide places for the animals to explore and play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk on the support ship Discovery , used in deep-sea exploration . The ship vibrates with all the authenticity of art expedition about to get under way . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Although the replica of the Amistad , built at Mystic Seaport , looks very much like the historic vessel of the 1830s , it is larger and contains exhibition and classroom space . Local craftsmen used traditional skills and construction techniques common to wooden schooners built in the 19th century . <p> For more information about Mystic Seaport , 1-888-973-2767 or visit www.mysticseaport.org . <p> By Holly G.
