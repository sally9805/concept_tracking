Section : PRODUCT UPDATES tests &; trends <p> Recently , we came across an article that referred to established products as having reached " the microwave-oven stage in the market cycle . " After all , the story pointed out , it 's not as if you have to consult " Microwave Ovens for Dummies " before you buy . However , there are still differences in performance among models , differences that are worth knowing about if you 're in the market for a microwave . <p> Consider how evenly the ovens heat food . When we 've placed cheese-topped slices of bread side by side and heated them , ovens have almost always bubbled some parts of the cheese before others . As a rule , that 's still true , despite companies ' recent boasts about technologies designed to heat food uniformly . Sanyo touts Super Showerwave ; Goldstar , Intellowave . <p> Given these claims and our cheese-test results , we added a new test of evenness for this report . We refrigerated mashed potatoes , pressed them into a round glass pan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result : Heating patterns varied , usually by about the same moderate amount . Mashed potatoes heated by the large Emerson MW8168 varied the most , from lukewarm to extremely hot . No technology heated especially uniformly . <p> Even if engineers found a way to distribute microwave energy perfectly evenly , a meal 's components would heat differently . There are , however , steps you can take to make the food in any microwave heat more evenly : Use the turntable ; use automatic programs ; and spread food out , cover it , stir it periodically , and let it stand for a few minutes before you eat . WATT ELSE IS NEW ? <p> Evenness aside , ovens continue to grow faster , smarter , and bigger . <p> Watts . Higher power means faster heating  --  up to a point . Differences of about 100 watts or less may not matter much . Moreover , ovens may not have the exact wattage they claim . In our tests , measured wattage was sometimes considerably lower than claimed , so a 1,300-watt oven may provide closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven when it determines ( usually by sensing steam ) that food is hot enough . A sensor adds about $10 to $15 to the price of a countertop model and about $40 to $50 to the price of an over-the-range model . To test whether a sensor is worth paying for , we used automatic programs to cook frozen and fresh vegetables and to reheat lasagna in ovens with and without a sensor . Both types of oven did fine . We also used Reheat buttons to warm a plate of meatloaf , mashed potatoes , and green beans . A few models sans sensor left the meal too cold ( it required extra time ) , but most sensor models left it hot enough . Note that with ovens in sensor mode , the food 's final temperature is partly a function of the cover : They tend to stop earlier if you use draped wax paper than if you use a tighter cover . You may need to experiment with covers to get the right degree of heating . <p> Size . Some ovens are roomy enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heat a lot of food , rather than just " zap " coffee , a big one might be handy . <p> Other tasks . Most ovens did very well when we used their Automatic Defrost buttons to thaw frozen ground chuck , and most Popcorn buttons produced at least 10 cups from a 3.5-ounce bag . However , Beverage buttons often left coffee too hot . <p> Ovens usually have one or more " instant-on " buttons . They let you begin heating without pressing a start key  --  convenient but possibly worrisome to parents of young children . HOME OVER THE RANGE <p> Over-the-range models did well overall . The Kenmore 6964 and KitchenAid KHMS147H let you pan-fry food . The Kenmore also has a halogen-light Top Brown feature . Eggs we " fried " did look sort of fried , and the Kenmore browned burgers . But you 're saving a little time just to get food that does n't look as good as it would if you 'd used a pan . <p> Over-the-range ovens have a few drawbacks . They act as a range hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . They 're expensive . And if there 's no dedicated electrical outlet where they 're installed , you 'll need an electrician . Recommendations <p> Almost all microwave ovens but the compacts were very good or excellent . Buy by features , size , price , and reliability ( see the chart below ) . <p> Large ovens . The Panasonic NN-S960 , $170 , did best and is quite big inside . Also excellent , and A CR Best Buy , is the Goldstar MA-1302S , $130 . <p> Midsized ovens . The Kenmore 6028 , $110 , is a good value . <p> Compact ovens . The GE Profile JE740 , $85 , is easier to use than others . <p> Over-the-range ovens . The GE Profile JVM1660 , $460 , was excellent . <p> HOW THEY COMPARE <p> Many of the ovens performed very well overall , so features may play a major role when it comes time to buy . Here are common features and a rundown of the ovens that have them . The chart includes models closely related to the ones we tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sensor . The increased automation it provides makes it worth the slight extra cost . <p> Detailed user prompts in display . Cooking is easier when the oven guides you through the process . <p> Power level in display . An oven with this feature shows the power level you 've chosen . <p> Handle , dial controls . The alternatives are a push panel and touchpad controls . <p> Tones on/off . If you already have too many beeping appliances in your kitchen , you may appreciate the ability to turn off the oven 's signals . <p> Stainless steel . We 've noted models with stainless-steel accents ; others may come that way for about $50 to $100 more . <p> Design trends : What 's in ? Dials and integrated handles , as on the Goldstar MA- 1302S , above . Other trends : soft edges , recessed turntables , translucent color , and stainless steel . Industry experts claim that microwave ovens of the future will be networked to the Internet . Prototypes can scan a product 's bar code and use it to adjust the cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> RATINGS Microwave ovens Shop Smart <p> Major brands include GE , Kenmore , Panasonic , Samsung , Sharp , and Whirlpool . Sears and Wal-Mart are the most-popular outlets for microwaves . When considering size , note that although over-the-range ovens are big outside , they may not be inside : With their turntable on , they hold less than most large ovens . If you like to see food as it cooks , consider ovens with a black- screened window , which generally provides a clearer view than a white-screened window . <p> GE Profile JVM1660 , $460 The tests behind the Ratings <p> Under brand and model , " new " indicates models tested for this report . Bracketed letters and numbers refer to color of the tested model . Most were black but come in white , too . Capacity is the maker 's claim , followed by what we measured . An asterisk marks actual capacity with the turntable off . Overall score is based mainly on ease of use and ability to defrost ground chuck . Comments call out warranties that differ from the norm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five years on the magnetron ( parts only ) . For most over-the-range ovens , the warranty covers in-home service . Price is the approximate retail . <p> All ovens : Stop when door is opened . Hold a 10-inch dinner plate ; at least one large TV dinner ; or a large , whole chicken on the turntable . Have electronic digital display with clock . Have a child-lockout feature . <p> All over-the-range ovens : Fit above a standard 30-inch range . Have a turntable that can be turned off to increase capacity .

You can minimize potential problems by choosing a reliable brand . Our brand repair histories have been quite consistent over the years , though they are not infallible predictors .
