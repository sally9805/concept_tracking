Landscape and Longing // I // America 's Most Wanted was an audacious painting , even by the inflated standards of the contemporary art scene . In 1993 , Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid , expatriate Soviet artists who had settled in the United States , received money from the Nation Institute to study the artistic preferences of people in ten countries . They oversaw a detailed worldwide poll , conducted for them in the United States by Marttila &amp; Kiley and by various other public opinion firms overseas . In some locales , the polls were followed up with town hall meetings and focus groups . All participants were asked what they would like to see a picture of , whether they preferred interior or landscape scenes , what kinds of animals they liked , favorite colors , what sorts of people they enjoyed seeing depicted-famous or ordinary , clothed or nude , young or old-and so forth . Extrapolated to the general populations of the countries polled , the graphs and tables of figures produced by Komar and Melamid 's People 's Choice project claimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic preferences of " close to two billion people . " // But this project produced more than numerical preferences : these talented artists ( they were originally trained as socialist realists ) then went on actually to paint most-wanted and least-wanted paintings for every country in the study-pastiches based on favorite colors , shapes , and subject matters for each nationality . // The least-wanted paintings are bad news for anyone hoping someday to see modernist abstraction achieve mass acceptance . People in almost all nations disliked abstract designs , especially jagged shapes created with a thick impasto in the commonly despised colors of gold , orange , yellow , and teal . This cross-cultural similarity of negative opinion was matched on the positive side by another remarkable uniformity of sentiment : almost without exception , the most-wanted painting was a landscape with water , people , and animals . Since the overwhelmingly favorite color in the world turned out to be blue , Komar and Melamid used blue as the dominant color of their landscapes . Their America 's Most Wanted , the painting based on the poll results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for historical figures , children , and wild animals by placing George Washington on a grassy area beside an attractive river or lake . Near him walk three clean-cut youngsters , looking like vacationers at Disneyland ; to their right two deer cavort , while in the water behind Washington a hippopotamus bellows . // To consider the survey seriously and then turn to Komar and Melamid 's painted results is to realize you 've been conned . It is as though the Nation Institute had been persuaded by two clever chefs to commission an expensive poll to determine America 's most-wanted food . The chefs study the resulting statistical preferences-a highly varied list that is nevertheless topped by ice cream , pizza , hamburgers , and chocolate-and then come up with America 's most-wanted food : hamburger-flavored ice cream with chocolate-coated pizza nuggets . Just because people like George Washington , African game , and children in their pictures , it does n't follow that they want them all in the same one . // It would be wrong , however , to write off the People 's Choice project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People in very different cultures around the world gravitate toward the same general type of pictorial representation : a landscape with trees and open areas , water , human figures , and animals . More remarkable still was the fact that people across the globe preferred landscapes of a fairly uniform type : Kenyans appeared to like landscapes that more resembled upstate New York than what we might think of as the present flora and terrain of Kenya . In an interview in Painting by Numbers , the book that presented the data and paintings for the project , Alexander Melamid remarks ( apparently into a tape recorder ) : // It might seem like something funny , but , you know , I 'm thinking that this blue landscape is more serious than we first believed . Talking to people in the focus groups before we did our poll and at the town hall meetings around the country after ... almost everyone you talk to directly-and we 've already talked to hundreds of people-they have this blue landscape in their head . It sits there , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the smallest detail . So I 'm wondering , maybe the blue landscape is genetically imprinted in us , that it 's the paradise within , that we came from the blue landscape and we want it ... We now completed polls in many countries-China , Kenya , Iceland , and so on-and the results are strikingly similar . Can you believe it ? Kenya and Iceland-what can be more different in the whole fucking world-and both want blue landscapes . // He goes on to say that a dream of modernism was to " find universal art , " that " the square was what could unite people . " But modernism 's dream turns out to be a delusion : " The blue landscape is what is really universal , maybe to all mankind . " // Komar and Melamid drop the subject , but it is raised again by the philosopher and art critic for the Nation , Arthur Danto , in his philosophical meditation on the most-wanted paintings . He is annoyed by George Washington and a hippo sharing the scene , calling America 's Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually wants . He also finds it predictable that a poll of American tastes should yield a landscape in " Hudson River Biedermeier " style . But he , too , is surprised that // throughout the world the results have been strikingly congruent , in the sense that each country 's Most Wanted looks like , give or take a few details , every other Most Wanted ... And it is at the very least cause for reflection that what randomly selected populations of the world round " most want " are paintings in the generic , all-purpose realist style the artists invented for America 's Most Wanted ... The " most wanted painting , " speaking transnationally , is a nineteenth-century landscape ... the kind of painting whose degenerate descendants embellish calendars from Kalamazoo to Kenya . // Danto then tosses out a remark that is consistent with Melamid 's meditation and , if true , would undermine a generation or two of art theory ( including Danto 's own theory of art ) : " The 44-percent-blue landscape with water and trees must be the a priori aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , as if modernism never happened . " // As if modernism never happened ? Having put forward this hypothetical challenge to his own deeply held theoretical commitments , Danto then tries to explain the uncanny cross-cultural uniformity : " It is possible , of course , that everyone 's concept of art was formed by calendars ( even in Kenya ) , which now constitutes a sort of paradigm of what everyone thinks of when they think of art . " Referring to psychological research that shows there are paradigms that govern what people will think of first when asked to identify something in a category ( asked to name a bird , people will usually think robin or sparrow , not albatross or kiwi ) , Danto tries to argue that calendars have come to govern worldwide what people initially think of when they think of art . This would explain , he suggests , the worldwide resistance to modernism . " It is altogether likely , " he says , " that what Komar and Melamid have unearthed is less what people prefer than what they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis presupposes that picture preferences are culturally produced and are indefinitely malleable , depending on what our culture makes familiar to us . When we think of a robin ( instead of a grebe ) if asked to imagine a bird , or think of a man ( instead of a woman ) if asked to imagine an airline pilot , we fall victim to stereotypes derived from childhood socialization-our experiences of walking in the park or flying in airplanes . For Danto , it all must come down in the end to enculturation : there is no category of natural interests in pictorial representations . " That would be why , " Danto claims , " when throughout history anything has deviated significantly from the predominantly blue landscape , the spontaneous response has been that it is not art . " It follows that the true villain in the persistent , worldwide resistance to modernism-roughly , abstraction-is therefore the world calendar industry : " Why else would the Kenyans , for example , come out with the same kind of painting as everyone else even though 70 percent of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from the following list , which type of art would you say you prefer ? ' - when the other choices were Asian , American , and European ? " Danto then concludes his analysis with three contentious sentences : // There is nothing in the least African about the Hudson River Biedermeier style of landscape with water . But it may be exactly with reference to such images that Kenyans learned the meaning of art . It is no accident that in the Kenyan questionnaire , in response to the question on what types of art people have in their homes , 91 percent mentioned prints from calendars ( though , in fairness , 72 percent mentioned " prints or posters " ) . // This position on the blue landscapes is consistent and thoughtful . It is also profoundly wrong . First , an incidental point : it is incorrect to say that there is nothing African about the landscape in America 's Most Wanted . Remove George Washington , the children , and the deer and , even with the apparently deciduous tree in the foreground , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Africa , e.g. , much of Mount Kenya National Park . Speaking of visual stereotypes , Danto himself may be in the thrall of images of the dusty plains that extend from eastern Kenya and into Somalia and Ethiopia , but central Kenya has many areas with mountains , rivers , and lakes . Even if most Kenyans involved with the poll did not live in the mountainous areas , they would know of them . // Danto argues that if Kenyan landscape preferences happen to coincide with Hudson River Biedermeier , it is because Hudson River imagery has somehow been powerfully embedded in African minds . He believes he has fingered the source for this : the calendars that 91 percent of Africans report having in their homes . Although he momentarily raises the theoretical possibility that a liking for blue landscapes might be an innate feature of the human mind , he quickly discards the notion , placing the blame squarely on the calendar industry . In Danto 's frame , an African liking for images of a certain type can only be explained by exposure to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent with his art critic 's eye for the issue : he sees America 's Most Wanted in terms of Biedermeier and Hudson River School styles , rather than seeing Komar and Melamid 's painting for what it is as a realist representation-a generic , lushly forested scene of hills surrounding water that could be anywhere from New York to New Zealand to Alaska to Asia to Africa . // Danto 's certainty that landscape tastes must be acquired by individuals through exposure to images is an unexamined presupposition , and a false one at that . Human and animal life in general may be full of interests , inclinations , and sentiments that are not learned , from the experience either of images or of anything else , though they may be elicited and shaped by experience and learning . An example : the window of my office at the New Zealand university where I teach is high , and its ledge offers a convenient perch and nesting place for pigeons . Whatever their charms , these creatures , alas , are extremely messy ; they finally made the ledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all times . How to keep them away ? My solution is a rubber snake on the ledge . I have seen the birds land on the ledge , see the snake , and immediately depart . They do n't come back . The odd fact is that , although European pigeons have been in New Zealand for a couple of hundred pigeon generations , there are no snakes in New Zealand and never have been . The phobic reaction of the birds is therefore learned neither from exposure to snakes nor from images of snakes . In snake-free New Zealand it is a perfect instance of a natural atavism : an innate fear-response that is passed , unnecessarily in these parts , from generation to generation of pigeons. // Human responses to landscapes also show atavisms , and the Komar and Melamid experiments are a fascinating , if inadvertent , demonstration of this . The lush blue landscape type that the Russian artists discovered is found across the world because it is an innate preference . This preference is not explained just by cultural traditions . Specifically , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might explain why even Kenyans think Hudson River School when asked about favorite pictures evades a more plausible hypothesis : that calendars-and the picture preferences they reveal in completely independent cultures-tap into innate inclinations . This fundamental attraction to certain types of landscapes is not socially constructed but is present in human nature as an inheritance from the Pleistocene , the 1.6 million years during which modern human beings evolved . The calendar industry has not conspired to influence taste but rather caters to preexisting , precalendrical human preferences . The tantalizing question is : why is there such a persistent preference for the blue , watery landscape ? // II // The psychological literature on paradigm theory is what Danto appeals to in his explanation of why Kenyans gave the same response as everyone else when asked for their favorite landscape . There exists , however , another body of psychological scholarship that is much more potent in addressing cross-cultural landscape tastes . It is a wide-ranging literature , some of it statistical ( not unlike Komar and Melamid 's poll ) and also theoretical , offering hypotheses to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it are old , it was initiated in its contemporary incarnation in the 1970s by Jay Appleton , particularly in his book The Experience of Landscape . Appleton 's ideas were deepened and extended by Roger S. Ulrich , connected to larger issues of cognition and perception by Stephen and Rachel Kaplan , and validated and given a summary expression by Gordon H. Orians and Judith H. Heerwagen . Orians put forward a general account of the kind of ideal landscape that human beings would find intrinsically pleasurable . In his formulation , this landscape has much in common with the savannas and woodlands of East Africa where hominids split off from chimpanzee lineages and much of early human evolution occurred ; hence it is called " the Savanna Hypothesis . " Briefly , this landscape type includes these elements : // open spaces of low ( or mown ) grasses interspersed with thickets of bushes and groupings of trees ; // the presence of water directly in view , or evidence of water nearby or in the distance ; // an opening up in at least one direction to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bird life ; and // a diversity of greenery , including flowering and fruiting plants . // By now , this research is developed enough to be able to say much more about innate landscape preferences . These preferences turn out to be more than just vague , general attractions toward generic scenes : they are notably specific . African savannas are not only the probable scene of a significant portion of human evolution , they are to an extent the habitat meat-eating hominids evolved for : savannas contain more protein per square mile than any other landscape type . Moreover , savannas offer food at close to ground level , unlike rain forests , tropical or temperate , which are more easily navigable by tree-dwelling apes. // Human beings are less attracted to absolutely open , flat grasslands and more toward a moderate degree of hilly undulation , suggesting a desire to attain vantage points for orientation . Verdant savannas are preferred experimentally to savannas in the dry season . The type of savanna that is ideal appears to be the very savanna imitated not only in paintings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of New York 's Central Park . The modern design of golf courses can make stunning use of such savanna motifs . // ( Continues ... ) //
