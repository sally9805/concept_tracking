His face <p> contorts . His mouth opens and closes , trying to utter sounds . <p> Big Daddy drops the head , looking down at its befuddled eyes <p> with sympathy . After a moment , the sympathy is joined by <p> rage . Big Daddy lifts his right foot and brings it STOMPING <p> DOWN on the disembodied head , CRUSHING ITS SKULL . <p> The convoy ROARS off , leaving a cloud of exhaust . Big Daddy *** <p> sees Harry 's downed motorcycle lying in the street . The butt <p> of an AUTOMATIC RIFLE protrudes from a saddlebag . <p> Big Daddy goes over . Pulls out the rifle . Tests the weight of <p> it in his hand . Curls his finger in through the guard and <p> pulls the trigger . <p> ** <p> BLAM ! A bullet ricochets off a brick wall . Big Daddy is <p> startled at first . Then , he relaxes , realizing the rifle 's <p> power . With surprising dexterity , he slings the weapon 's <p> strap over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> as if comforted by it . Turning , he looks toward ... <p> ... THE DISTANT GLOW OF A SKYSCRAPER that can be seen ON THE <p> HORIZON . That 's the direction the convoy is headed . That 's <p> where the bad men came from . That 's where he wants to go . <p> REVERSE ANGLE : <p> With the city in the distance , Big Daddy starts walking . <p> NUMBER NINE falls into step beside him . Soon there are MORE . <p> None of them knows where they are going . Or why .

Up the ramp toward the street . <p> The nozzle remains stuck in the " fabric " of the windshield . Gasoline continues to flow into the car . Kaufman crawls into the front seat , wincing from his wounds , and KICKS the nozzle out of the window with his good leg , getting soaked with gas in the process . He opens the door . Limps to the pump . Grabs the keys . As he starts back toward the car ... <p> ... WHAM ! SOMETHING is standing right in front of him . It 's one of the WALKING DEAD . It 's ... <p> * <p> * <p> ...

The SOUND of a bowling ball . <p> Kaufman looks up . It 's not a bowling ball . It 's an OIL POT , <p> rolled down the ramp by Big Daddy . Kaufman SCREAMS . The fire <p> ball approaches the gas-soaked Lincoln , the gas-soaked <p> Kaufman , and ... <p> ... WHOOOMPH ! Kaufman and The Cholo Thing are IMMOLATED .
