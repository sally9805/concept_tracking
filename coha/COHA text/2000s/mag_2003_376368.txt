What if you could work online from anywhere , inside your office or out ? Check e-mail in the conference room , submit an expense report while waiting for a delayed flight , instant message from a coffee shop . With no more walls to demarcate your work space , would you be more productive , or just worn out ? <P> That 's exactly what the employees at iAnywhere Solutions , a unit of Sybase headquartered in Waterloo , Ontario , are trying to figure out . About 18 months ago the company , which makes software for handheld devices , plunged headlong into the wireless world by turning its entire campus into a giant wi-fi hot spot . Employees  --  mostly in marketing and product development  --  with wi-fi  --  enabled laptops ( about half the 250 full-time staff at headquarters ) can access the Web at lightning speed from anywhere in the building , no wires necessary . <P> What 's so great about wi-fi that a company would reconfigure its entire computer infrastructure around it ? For openers , it 's as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone , as addictive as a BlackBerry and nearly imperceptible . What 's not so great about it ? Same thing . Wi-fi makes work that much easier to do and that much harder to escape . " We 're just adapting to this new environment , adapting to what the technology allows you to do , " says Martyn Mallick , a product manager at iAnywhere . <P> The company is one of a surprisingly small number of U.S. firms that have installed wi-fi networks . Fewer than 5% of U.S. workers use them today , according to an estimate by Gartner , a high-tech research firm . With IT budgets squeezed , few companies are rolling out new projects that do n't immediately add to the bottom line . But pioneers like iAnywhere are giving it a shot  --  and giving the rest of us a preview of what the wireless workplace is like . <P> So far , the biggest change has been felt in meetings , which used to be decidedly low-tech . Employees used to jot notes in black , spiral-bound paper notebooks and later transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're toting around laptops , and instead of just taking notes at meetings , Mallick and his colleagues are exchanging files , looking up stuff on the Web  --  a description of a competitor 's product , for instance  --  and consulting their calendars to choose a time for their next meeting . " Before , everyone would leave , and maybe 13 e-mails would go around , " Mallick says . By dealing with questions as they arise , staff members can move on " action items " as they pop up . " Sometimes I would come out of a meeting with a page or two of things to do , " says Milja Gillespie , a marketing manager at iAnywhere . " I can easily cut that in half . " <P> Mallick admits , however , that attending a meeting full of people communing with their laptops instead of one another can be strange . " Sometimes I find it distracting , " he says , " when I 'm giving a presentation , and everyone 's typing away on their laptops . It 's a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this is the new workplace . " It is n't too hard to tell , though , when people are goofing off . " If they are looking up and paying attention to you and making eye contact , their body language tells a lot about whether they 're part of a meeting . "
