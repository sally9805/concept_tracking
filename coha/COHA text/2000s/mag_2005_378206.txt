At first the Lexus RX 400h looks like another road-hogging sport-utility vehicle  --  albeit one that 's plusher than typical models . But because it draws power from two electric motors  --  in addition to a regular gas engine  --  the 400h is one of the most fuel-efficient SUVs . No wonder buyers have placed some 12,000 preorders for the car , which hits showrooms this month . TIME took a production model for a test drive to find out what all the buzz is about .  --  By Anita Hamilton <P> WHAT YOU GET As the first luxury hybrid SUV , the $48,535 400h comes equipped with creature comforts like a navigation system , rain-sensing wipers , aluminum alloy wheels and a screen that lets you see what 's behind you simply by looking at a dashboard monitor . ( A camera mounted just above the rear bumper provides the video stream . ) We found the navigation system to be slow and confusing but loved extra-cost options like the heated front seats ( $540 ) and the rear-seat DVD system with wireless headphones ( $1,840 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 400h is 29 m.p.g.  --  close to the 26 m.p.g. we got in more than 200 miles of test driving . In comparison , a Lexus RX 330 , which is identical to the 400h but runs on a standard gas engine , got only 14 m.p.g. on our tests . At start-up and in slow city traffic , the 400h runs solely on its silent electric motors , making for a peaceful commute . The 400h handled well , accelerated quickly and quietly engaged its gas engine . Because the 400h has a power output similar to that of a 4-liter V8 engine , you never feel as if you are compromising performance for fuel economy , as with some early hybrids , such as the Honda Insight . <P> THE BOTTOM LINE If you want a luxurious car that 's easy on the environment , this powerful , comfortable SUV fills the bill . It does n't make sense to buy the 400h to save money , given that the hybrid system adds about $5,000 to the price , eating up any savings on gas . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
