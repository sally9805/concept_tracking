Tornadoes were touching down all over Iowa , but I would n't have guessed it from listening to satellite radio . Outside , boiling up on both sides of Interstate 80 , black prairie thunderheads sizzled with greenish lightning . Inside my car the only sound was that of an E ! Entertainment biography of celebrity rock-widow Courtney Love . I reached for the dial and turned to CNN , then Fox , then NPR . But because all the news was national rather than local , not a single voice I came across could tell me that the town near the next exit  --  where I 'd reserved a motel room for the night  --  was being shredded at that very moment by winds of over 180 m.p.h . I switched to a channel devoted to Old Skool Rap , which normally ca n't be enjoyed in western Iowa , and tapped my left foot as the roofs were blown off houses only a couple of miles away . <P> When I bought a new car equipped with Sirius satellite radio , I had no idea how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape . With its clear , unvarying signal , which seems to arrive from a spot beyond the moon , and its vast profusion of music , news and talk shows , the medium places you at the center of everything , even when you 're in the middle of nowhere . The problem is that the center of everything is not an actual , inhabitable place but a floating media mirage , an invisible digital bubble of information located somewhere in the fifth dimension . Having passed through the canyonlands of Utah while listening to Caribbean pop and having crossed the Black Hills of South Dakota immersed in a disco channel called the Strobe , I feel after a year of nonstop driving ( 50,000 miles in all ) that I have n't , in fact , gone anywhere except deeper and deeper inside my radio . <P> It used to feel different out there on the road . Until just recently I measured my progress on cross-country driving trips by the rise and fall of radio signals that strengthened as I approached a town and fuzzed away as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alive , a patchwork of distinctive accents and peculiar regional interests . I knew I was getting close to Texas from the twang of steel guitars . I realized I might reach Omaha by suppertime when I started hearing crop reports . Often , when I was traveling through North Dakota , the only voices I could hear spoke in Native American languages , whose singsong tones , though I found them unintelligible , eased the loneliness of the long , straight highways . <P> The character of those conventional radio signals responded to the weather and time of day in a way that satellite transmissions do n't . Late at night , if the skies were clear enough to make out every star in the Big Dipper , the empty spaces on my AM dial would suddenly and mysteriously fill up with broadcasts from a thousand miles away . Minneapolis ' WCCO , the powerful station that I grew up listening to and whose chuckling , easygoing announcers shaped my identity as a Minnesotan , reached out to me late one evening in eastern Washington as I sat parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tow from AAA . I felt grateful for that little miracle , then desolate when those hometown announcers faded back to static .
