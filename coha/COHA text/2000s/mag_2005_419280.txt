These " damaged goods " undergo far more than astronomers thought 40 years ago . // Astronomers study comets for the promise of looking at well-preserved relics from the outer solar system 's formation days . However , the original theories of comets as completely pristine samples have changed over time . Scientists now see comets as somewhat damaged goods that have sustained numerous different evolutionary processes . In the beginning In 1950 , Fred Whipple of Harvard University determined the solid body that generates the beautiful coma and tail seen from Earth is actually a flying mountain of ice . Later that year , Jan Oort of Holland discovered cornets are remnants of the formation epoch of the planets . Oort said cometary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ejected to a far-away reservoir ( located 10,000 times as far from the Sun as Earth ) that now bears his name - the Oort Cloud . Together , Whipple and Oort put in place the basic paradigm for what comets are and where they originated . The implication of Oort 's idea was particularly profound , and decades of research have'refined his theqry . According to Oort , because comets are stored so far from the Sun , where temperatures are only a few degrees above absolute zero , they must be pristine relics of the solid material that formed the outer planets . Evidence confirmed Oort 's idea : Comets are perfectly preserved relics of the planetary-formation era some 4.5 billion years ago . Over time , planetary astronomers concluded that comets contain about as much dirt as ice . We also found that while most long-period comets do come from the Oort Cloud , short-period comets come from a closer ( but nevertheless very cold ) reservoir outside of , and overlapping , Pluto 's orbit - the Kuiper Belt . But the essence of the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solar systems earliest days . Photograph COMET HYAKUTAKE put on a fabulous show in 1996 .

HOVERING FAR FROM THE SUN - beginning at roughly 5,000 AU and extending as far as 100,000 AU - the Oort Cloud may have as many as a trillion comets . The inner ring on the image is the Kuiper Belt , which overlaps Pluto 's orbit at times and contains a few billion comets . Because the Kuiper Belt occupies a much smaller volume , it has a higher comet density than the Oort Cloud . // A shift in view The conceptual shift away from seeing comets as pristine relics began in the 1970s . Laboratory astronomers around the world began to simulate the kinds of radiation suffered by bodies in space . In the same way experience broadens our worldview , astronomers ' views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although very far from the Sun , still were bathed with ultraviolet radiation that , over billions of years , can darken and color their surfaces . Researchers also showed that high-energy cosmic rays emanating from the Sun and galactic sources penetrate cometary surfaces to depths of up to several yards , and in doing so , alter chemical bonds and even the microscopic structure of cometary surface materials . Together , ultraviolet and cosmic rays create a rind on comet surfaces . However , these discoveries did not force astronomers to rethink their theories . They believed that as soon as a comet approached the Sun - where we could study it - the Sun 's intense heat would remove the " damaged goods " of the surface layer quickly by evaporating surface ices . About the same time , scientists realized comets could be heated internally by the decay of radioactive isotopes that are common in meteorites . Thus , deep cometary interiors could have warmed to temperatures that , in the extreme , could have evaporated ices like carbon dioxide and water , thereby causing comets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This finding further eroded comets ' longstanding reputation as pristine relics of the solar system 's formation . This was especially insidious because the altered interiors would appear gradually as upper layers peeled away and evaporated over time under the heat of repeated solar passages . Adding complexity By the late 1980s , I began researching comet evolution . Within weeks , I discovered that cometary surfaces suffer a kind of sandblasting during their time far from the Sun . The Sun 's speed relative to the gas and dust in the interstellar medium ( the material between the stars ) is about 62,000 mph ( 100,000 km/h ) . At this speed , every collision with interstellar dust erodes the cometary surface . Model calculations show that , over time , this erosion could strip cometary surfaces of a layer as shallow as a few inches or as deep as a few tens of yards . Exactly how much material would be removed is uncertain , largely because no spacecraft has ever landed on a cometary surface and revealed its density , porosity , and other physical properties . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cometary surface should deepen . While the quantitative effect of this interstellar erosion can not be gauged , its existence is hard to deny . About the same time that interstellar erosion was identified , Michael Shull of the University of Colorado and I discovered faraway comets do n't always remain as cold as previously thought ; they experience brief heating episodes . We determined the Sun is n't the only heat source comets endure . Rare passages of very luminous stars - O and B stars in particular - can come close enough to the Oort Cloud to warm it to up to 30 kelvins for thousands of years at a time . We also estimated that , over time , a handful of supernovae had exploded close enough to the Sun ( within 30 to 65 lightyears ) to warm the entire Oort Cloud briefly to temperatures as high as 70 K. Although these temperatures are frigid by terrestrial - and even martian or jovian - standards , they are warm enough both to sublimate some frost species in cometary surfaces ( such as methane , nitrogen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ices near the surface . Chips off the old block If these findings were n't enough , the clincher was discovered in the late 1990s , when groups , including my own , began to study the effects of comet collisions within both the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper Belt . Scientists found that although the Oort Cloud 's cometary population is high - comprising perhaps 1 trillion comets - the Oort Cloud 's volume is so large that cometary collisions are exceedingly rare . By contrast , the Kuiper Belt , although populated by perhaps only a few billion comets , is 1,000 times more compact than the Oort Cloud . This creates a higher density of comets in the Kuiper Belt and makes for frequent collisions - on astronomical timescales . Virtually every primordial comet in the Kuiper Belt should have been destroyed by now as a result of high-speed collisions . In addition , scientists found new comets would be created by the collision fragments of large Kuiper Belt objects ( KBOs ) . The implication of this finding , made by multiple research groups using independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Kuiper Belt are not likely ancient , as previously thought , but are instead " recently " created chips off of KBOs . They are created in much the same way as small asteroids , which scientists know are collisional fragments ejected from larger asteroids . Childhood 's end The bewildering array of cometary evolutionary effects that have been identified over the past few decades has changed our view of comets as pristine relics . We now appreciate that there are many shades of gray between wholly pristine and simply old material . Astronomers still think comets are the best-preserved samples of the stuff from which the outer solar system was made , but they are not the perfect samples they were once thought to be . Does this lower the value of cometary studies and the need for sample-return missions from comets ? Not at all ! If anything , comets have more to tell us than we once believed . We now know they hold a good , if imperfect , record of the solar systems earliest era . Comets can tell us of the systems travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way , luminous star encounters , and even the effects of collisions between ancient bodies orbiting the Sun . As we look forward to new journeys to comets , like the Rosetta cometary orbiter and lander , and - just perhaps - a cometary sample-return mission , we should expect that the story will become more and more interesting . Just like other kinds of solar system bodies - from Mars to the icy satellites of Jupiter and Saturn , and to KBOs - comets should still have surprises in store for us .

Sidebar PERPLEXING PLANETOID Since its discovery November 14 , 2003 , the Oort Cloud planetoid Sedna continues to surprise astronomers . Scientists know it is 1,120 miles ( 1,800 kilometers ) across - roughly 2/3 the size of Pluto - and that it is the most distant solar system object detected . And while they know Sedna has a highly elliptical , 11,500-year orbit - getting as close to the Sun as 76 AU and as far away as 1,000 AU - much about the planetoid remains a mystery . Did Sedna form between Jupiter and Saturn , and was it then flung into the Oort Cloud by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star only to be sucked into our solar system ? Or did Sedna , as S. Alan Stern 's research shows , form right where it is now , with another star altering the planetoid 's orbital eccentricity and inclination ? Only future discoveries can solve this puzzle . When Sedna 's orbit was first calculated , it appeared to complete one rotation in 20 days . Because of this long rotation period , scientists expected the planetoid had a companion moon slowing its rotation . But they could n't find a moon . Instead , astronomers saw a subtle variation in Sedna 's rotation they did n't see before . After further observations and calculations , they found Sedna completes one rotation in 10 hours . It appears Sedna has a typical rotation period after all . No moon needed . Most recently , the astronomers who discovered Sedna , led by Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology , found it has avoided collisions because of its distance from other objects . Infrared studies from the Gemini North Telescope on Mauna Kea , Hawaii , show the planetoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of methane and water ice , meaning there may be a lot of asphalt-like " goo , " caused by ultraviolet and cosmic rays , on Sedna 's surface . - Liz Kruesi Author Affiliation S.
