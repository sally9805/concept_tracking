It would be a stretch to call Yasser Arafat confused . But watching him  --  at home , at Camp David or at other stops on the international stage  --  has been to see a man in search of an identity . Some days he seems to promise an imminent Palestinian state . Other days , insiders say , he agrees to postpone an announcement of statehood until after the U.S. presidential elections . He ca n't decide if he 's supposed to go through doors before or after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak . <P> What is clear is that Arafat is searching for a legacy that will fit his ambitions for himself and for his people . It is that search that brought him to Camp David and to his tense , exacting talks with President Clinton and Barak . " God , it 's hard , " Clinton confessed of the process . And much of the difficulty could be traced to Arafat , a man whose place in history revolves entirely around the outcome of his eleventh-hour negotiations with Israel . <P> What has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sure which legacy he wants most . Age 70 and ailing , presumably from a nervous disorder  --  Parkinson 's , some say  --  Arafat is desperate to preside over a newly born , independent Palestinian state . But he has also seized upon a competing priority  --  preserving his place in history as a steadfast nationalist hero . To reach agreement with Israel on the terms of statehood would require profound compromises on what have long been almost sacred Palestinian demands . Arafat 's great fear  --  his " obsession , " says an aide  --  is that if he makes these concessions , he will be pilloried as a traitor to his people instead of a hero . Says a senior Palestinian official : " Arafat is terrified he 'll be remembered as the one who gave away Palestinian rights . " <P> Until the talks at Camp David  --  and there too at times  --  Arafat and his delegates held hard to maximalist positions that the Israelis reject out of hand . To end the conflict once and for all , the Palestinians said , Israel would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Bank . That would include all of East Jerusalem , which would become the capital of Palestine , as well as areas colonized by 175,000 Jewish settlers , who would have to leave . The negotiators also demanded the right of all Palestinian refugees from areas that are within Israel to return to their homes , which Israel fears would eliminate its Jewish majority . <P> At Camp David , the Israelis presented compromises . They want to keep those parts of the West Bank , perhaps 5% to 10% of the area , where most Jewish settlers live and might offer the Palestinians , as a swap , a portion of uninhabited land within Israel proper . Israel is open to allowing limited numbers of refugees to return , under cover of an existing family-reunification program , with the rest compensated for their property out of an international fund and permanently resettled in their current host countries , in Palestine or elsewhere .
