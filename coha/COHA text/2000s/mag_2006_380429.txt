Counter seating will serve eat-and-run customers . Those looking to linger will find soft lighting and plush chairs . Mingling teens can cram tables together in a flexible seating area . " It 's something McDonald 's should have done years ago , " says restaurant analyst Howard Penney of Friedman Billings Ramsey .
