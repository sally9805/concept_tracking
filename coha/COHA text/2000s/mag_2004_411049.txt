200 YEARS AGO , LEWIS &; CLARK MAPPED THE WEST WITH CRUDE TOOLS AND LITTLE TECHNOLOGY . HOW CLOSE DID THEY GET TO THE TRUTH ? EVEN NASA WANTS TO KNOW . // Lewis &; Clark spent nearly two and a half years seeking " almost perfect view . " // Ready for an Adventure ? The United States is just 27 years old in 1803 , when President Thomas Jefferson asks you to take a remarkable journey of discovery . The president requests that you gather a team that will explore the Missouri River and beyond , to the Pacific Ocean . He asks you to map the newly purchased Louisiana Territory and the rest of your route . He believes you 'll find a waterway to the Pacific Ocean that can carry American goods to Asian countries . Your members will be among the first Americans to travel beyond Mandan Indian villages . On your map , that space reads : " Unknown . " Getting Ready Meriwether Lewis agreed to this challenging honor . He named William Clark his co-captain and assembled a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a year . During that time he studied astronomy , science and botany . He bought mapping and plotting tools . He bought chain poles for distance measuring . He bought supplies : rifles , bullet molds , gun flints , powder and lead , from the U.S. Armory and Arsenal at Harper 's Ferry , Va . He ordered boats and a lightweight iron boat frame . Lewis packed quill pens , powdered ink and paper for journal-writing and record-keeping . He gathered camp supplies including fishing tackle and hooks , cooking pots and packable foods . He stashed needles , knives and beads to trade with natives . On May 14 , 1804 , the Corps of Discovery sets out from Camp Dubois , near St. Louis , Mo. , for the camping trip of a lifetime . // Lewis &; Clark spent nearly two and a half years seeking " a most perfect view . " // An Eventful Journey Six members ' journals survive today . They trace a route that follows rivers , including the Missouri . Lewis and Clark 's journals note daily distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time calculations . Clark 's contain detailed maps . Over 863 days , members describe paddling , sailing , walking and riding horseback across 8,000 miles of 11 present-day states . Journals mention more than 600 campsites , 200 new plants , 100 new animals and more than 50 Indian tribes . They detail scorching heat and freezing cold . They describe illness and note a death . At times they report abundant food ; at others , hunger . Each writer offers his viewpoint . Journals discuss the expedition 's over-wintering from late October 1804 until April 1805 near today 's Washburn , N.D. They describe a fort they built named Mandan . Two months later they relate hardship as the men haul canoes and equipment around the Great Falls of the Missouri . Many write of fatigue , bloody feet and pesky mosquitoes . Journals report burying the failed iron boat . In early December 1805 the tired team 's outbound journey ends at Fort Clatsop , which they build near present-day Astoria , Ore . The Corps suffers a bitter , wet winter . Clark " dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbound miles , using course and distance as his guide . His estimate , 4,162 miles traveled , is only 40 miles off . In many cases , his maps later prove accurate , too . President Jefferson 's imagined trade route does n't exist . But while seeking it , the Corps covers and names much of the American West . // Clark 's " draught of the falls and portage " of the Missouri Hiver , about July 4 , 1805. // By placing one of William Clark 's Great Falls maps over a modern-day LandSat satellite image of the area , researchers can determine how accurate the explorer 's mapping skills and techniques were . The answer : very accurate . // Though often exhausted from their journey , Lewis and Clark 's men found time to keep detailed journals , complete with drawings of newly discovered wildlife .

Though often exhausted from their journey , Lewis and dark 's men found time to keep detailed journals , complete with drawings of newly discovered wildlife . // Looking Back 200 Years Nearly 200 years after the expedition , archaeologist Ken Karsmizki is checking Lewis and Clark 's work . Using space-age technology , he is testing Clark 's maps and both leaders ' navigation skills . For years , Karsmizki wondered why no verified expedition campsites existed . He scoured the journals and studied Clark 's maps . The tired men wrote at day 's end ; exhaustion caused incomplete reports , and some dead reckoning . Journals also contain multiple maps of the same site , with different measurements . // In 2001 , news of Karsmizki 's field work reached NASA . The space agency knew its technology could help . As part of the NASA-Columbia Gorge Discovery Center collaboration , NASA offered its satellite technology as another survey tool at Fort Clatsop . NASA established the Lewis and Clark Satellite Imaging Project . Archaeology From Space NASA satellites map from hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of sensors record data based on landscape , vegetation and heat . Each piece of data offers a different set of comparisons with modern site maps . " These sensors are like eyes in the sky that let you see things invisible to the human eye , " Karsmizki says . At the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi , Joe Spruce , Lockheed-Martin remote sensing specialist , evaluates the accuracy of Clark 's Fort Clatsop maps . He compares the maps , journals and satellite imaging . This process helps Karsmizki narrow his search area . So far , the modern-day opinion is that Clark was dead-on much of the time , even using crude instruments in a difficult environment . " To NASA , the Lewis and Clark journals are appealing because they were explorers and we 're explorers , " says NASA 's Marco Giardino . " We 're exploring the planet ; they were exploring unknown lands . We have an exploration or discovery bond . " Sidebar " To NASA , THE LEWIS AND CLARK JOURNALS ARE APPEALING BECAUSE THEY WERE EXPLORERS AND WE 'RE EXPLORERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Missouri may have washed artifacts away . Artifacts could also be deeply buried . Hopeful still , he believed that the Lower Portage Camp was near Great Falls , Mont . His field surveys began there , using Clark 's maps , measurements and modern maps as guides . Sidebar Over 14 years , Karsmizki and his team excavated , finding things like a wooden stake , campfires and a gun flint dated to the expedition . Scientific analysis of the physical evidence conclusively identified the site as the Lower Portage Camp site . Seeking Fort Clatsop In 1995 , Karsmizki expanded his research to Fort Clatsop , where a reconstructed fort was built based on Clark 's crude map . If the original fort 's decayed timbers lay buried somewhere , surveys might detect them . Although Karsmizki has n't located a fort , promising finds include a musket ball and beads , all dated to the expedition 's time . WHERE 'S THE IRON BOAT ? President Thomas Jefferson and Meriwether Lewis teamed up to design a lightweight , collapsible iron boat , " The Experiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Journals report that , with sadness , Lewis ordered it buried at the Upper Portage Camp . Three expedition maps of this White Bear Island Camp exist . Only one says : " Deposit . " Was this the burial spot ? If not , what happened to the boat ? Theories abound . Some say members retrieved the boat on the inbound trip . Some believe Indians uncovered it . Others think the meandering river took it . Karsmizki believes it 's still buried there . Karsmizki 's hunt began in 1997 . Recently , NASA joined the search . By " rubber sheeting , " or stretching old maps to fit over a modern map , NASA continues to compare today 's landmarks to those Clark recorded and described . The boat discovery would be " unbelievable , considering what it could tell us , " Karsmizki says . " It would also be exciting to find something lost for 200 years-something so significant for the planning of the expedition . Being a part of such a discovery is what archaeologists dream of .
