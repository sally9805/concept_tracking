Headnote African-Americans find roots and rhythm in Salsa Dancing Some of Ayesha Karim 's friends in Chicago scoffed when she suggested going out salsa dancing for a night of fun . As African-Americans , they did not identify with the music , whose lyrics were in Spanish . And they knew few people who looked like them who danced to it . But Karini grew up listening and dancing freestyle to salsa and to its predecessor , mambo , which her mother called Afro-Cuban music . She also knew the music 's connection to Africa and that it moved her like no other . " I find that there is just something in the music with the congas and other drums and piano that just drives you crazy and makes you want to dance , " savs Karim , a marketing executive at U.S. Cellular . She began dancing salsa as a partner dance about eight years ago at one of the clubs her parents had frequented many years earlier when it was known under a different name . " I thought about salsa every night . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my steps there . I practiced with anybody I could find who was willing and with a broom if there was no one , " Karim says . " I wanted to be part of the group , those people who were so emotionally connected with the music and the artists . It was obsessive , compulsive , intoxicating . " During the last decade , an increasing number of AfricanAmericans also have found this steamy , high-energy dance with fancy footwork , rapid spins and gyrating hips intoxicating and now figure prominently among salsa dancers and instructors at clubs and dance studios throughout Chicago and other major cities . Fully a quarter of the patrons at several top salsa dance venues in the city are African-American . In Washington , about 99 percent of the patrons at Bar Nun , a popular U Street salsa club , are African-American . In Los Angeles and New York , where Latinos have given the word salsa the same cultural importance AfricanAmericans have attached to the word soul , the number of African-Americans on salsa dance floors has increased substantially . Despite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta salsa clubs just seven years ago , but now there are few salsa clubs in the metropolitan area that do not have a significant number of African-American patrons . Atlanta also is home of Afri-Salsa , an organization and marketing brand whose mission includes promoting cross-cultural exchanges and educating people about the Diaspora lineage and cultural link African-Americans have with salsa music and dancing . " We are more than just descendants of slaves inquiring about a dance ... We are Louisianians , Georgians , New Yorkers etc. , who are as much a part of the salsa " scene " as anyone else , " says Anana Harris Parris , the organization 's founder . Parris saw salsa dancing for the first time at a club in Washington and immediately was struck by the cultural diversity of participants . " There were all these different shades of people from different countries doing salsa-Dominicans , people from the Caribbean and South America , " she says . " What spoke to me was the similarity of the music 's rhythm to that I was familiar with from west African dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe space to explore and interact with another person without putting yourself at risk . " When she moved to Atlanta seven years ago , Harris Parris found Atlanta 's trendy Buckhead section , where several salsa clubs were located , lacking the racial diversity of Washington 's Adams Morgan area , home of the popular salsa venue Havana Village , or the waterfront area near Zanzibar , another popular salsa club with an African name . Moreover , not many African-Americans in Atlanta embraced salsa as part of their ancestral past . Afri-Salsa wants to fix that . Polemics over the development of salsa dancing aside , it is generally agreed that the dance form emerged in New York City in the 1950s and 1960s as a derivative of highly popular Afro-Cuban music and dance , themselves an amalgam of indigenous music and dance and forms from west Africa , which were brought to the Americas through the slave trade . In the 1960s , New York 's Fania Records began using the term salsa as a marketing tool and exercised great control over the " sound " and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Musical updates directly from Cuba were impeded by politics after Fidel Castro rose to power , and travel restrictions imposed by the U.S. and Cuba prevented Cuban musicians from freely traveling the 90 miles between the two nations . There has long been a rift between musical purists who viewed salsa as akin to a copyright infringement on AfroCuban music and dance and those who just wanted to dance to its rhythms , regardless of origin and development . During the last decade , salsa has regained popularity because of inclusion in television dance specials and movies such as Dance With Me , The Buena Vista Social Club and Dirty Dancing : Havana Nights , and the proliferation of salsa congresses in the U.S. and Europe . African-Americans increasingly have been drawn to salsa dancing through this exposure , through Latino friends , dance schools and clubs and plain old serendipity . " I have traveled all around the world and must say that everywhere I go , I see more and more African-Americans dancing to salsa better than some of the Latinos , " says wellknown band leader and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance lessons or something because no doubt the African-Americans have adopted salsa and tropical music and placed it into their lives in a very big way . " Michael Franklin , a dental student at Howard University , says salsa is his dance of choice . As a youth , he was exposed to Latin music and his mother taught him merengue , but he never thought much about it and heard it infrequently as he grew older and began listening to other music . It was at the club Fat Tuesdays in Atlanta where he heard salsa again as an adult , and this time , as he puts it , " had an epiphany . It was music that I had heard while growing up , music I liked but never did anything with it . " This time he took lessons , went out to dance , became hooked and joined the great legion of " salsaholics " who put on their dance shoes four or five nights a week . In Washington , he found salsa venues diverse and welcoming . " I thought , " Wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came to find out that the music 's roots were in Africa , " Franklin says . " There were so many people dancing salsa , so many styles and so many moves and , unlike at some of our clubs , you did not have to put on a game face to go . You did n't have to be suave or smooth before a woman would dance with you . You only needed a love of the dance . " Sometimes , induction into the fast-spinning world of salsa can be a bit unsettling . " For me , it was very scary . You walk out onto the dance floor and it 's all hips and hair , " says Keisha Banks , also of Washington . " But the natural rhythm and beat come very easily to most Black folks I know . " Tiffany Green of High Point , N.C. , illustrates this . She describes herself as " the family klutz , " adding : " My family still ca n't believe that I 'm so good at this . " Guillermo Cespedes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianist and historian for 23 years , lives in Los Angeles , where he says there is an obvious increase in the number of African-Americans at salsa clubs and who are teaching salsa . It is only recently , he says , that he does not bristle at the use of the word salsa to describe what he says is Afro-Cuban music . " The term salsa has helped disconnect the dance from our community . This is music that moves our people . It has an African base , and there is something about it that speaks to us . " I have spent most of my life trying to get this message out and , in the last 10 years , I have seen from the perspective of the bandstand that more and more Black people are embracing the dance , learning that it is a part of their history . " Cespedes has accused Fania Records of trying to co-opt Afro-Cuban music and dance . " They wanted it to be Latino music , so they tried to do that by taking the African out of the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my band went out to play , most of the people dancing looked Latino , as did most of the musicians . Now there is a very noticeable mix , both dancers and musicians . Two years ago , I played at the Playboy Jazz Festival in the Rose Bowl with a band called Dada , made up totally of Black Cubans . After the event , many Black people came up and expressed surprise at the roots of the music . They knew they were moved by it , but did not know why . " Sekou McMiller , the artistic director and choreographer of the Descartes Caribe Dance Company in Chicago , credits the rise in the number of salsa congresses held in the U.S. since 1997 for salsa 's increased popularity with African-Americans . Blacks already make up a considerable portion of salsa audiences in Europe and Scandinavia , he says , but it has been through the information and history passed on at salsa congresses here that many African-Americans come to know and experience the dance . " Nationwide there has been an increase in the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that has opened the door is more Blacks succeeding in the business aspect of it . I , for example , am director of a company whose main genre is Latin dancing , " says McMiller , whose company performs in the U.S. and in Europe . His goal is for his company to perform on Broadway . " You try to pick music that moves you when you do dancing and choreography , and this was the music that spoke to me . " It was not always that way . McMiller grew up studying classical flute music and listened mostly to jazz and later hip-hop . At 18 , he was working on a project as a musician that called for a salsa number . The music grabbed him , he says , and did not let go . Dating a woman who already was an avid salsa dancer provided further incentive . Former NBA player Kendall Gill also recalls a love-at-first-sight introduction to salsa .

' I had only bopped , stepped steppin ' ' and hiphopped until then , and now I wanted to be able to lead , to dance with a woman in sync and with precision as they were doing at the Copa . Some of the young guys think it does not look manly , but you look so cool if you can dance salsa . " Gill is now an avid salsa dancer and recently was in a Chicago version of Dancing With the Stars . He competed with salsa and rumba routines . Finding a place to learn salsa dancing is easy . Most salsa clubs offer free lessons before the start of open dancing , and it is offered at many dance studios , park districts and community colleges .
