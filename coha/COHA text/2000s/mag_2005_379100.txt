Disney CEO-elect Robert Iger , who has spearheaded the company 's move into China , spoke with TIME 's Jeffrey Ressner . Excerpts : <P> What are Disney 's China plans ? Our primary targets would be development of a park on the mainland , launching the Disney Channel and building our presence on new media platforms such as broadband and cell phones . And , of course , more Disney movies . <P> Do your movies make money in China ? It 's still modest . There are ticket-pricing issues , a small number of screens , limited release dates and a revenue-sharing model that 's fairly limited in terms of what we can make . Over time , the business will improve significantly . <P> Has there been headway on rampant DVD piracy ? There 's some progress . The government seems committed  --  at least in spirit  --  to doing something about it . Now it 's important for the spirit to be put into action . I think it will come . But it 's not there yet . <P> What will it take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There need to be more channels , more mass retail , more legitimate video , more theaters and more films released in the market . That would go a long way . <P> What lessons did you take from Disneyland Paris ? In Hong Kong we built a park that made much more sense economically . And clearly a variety of aspects are respectful of local culture . <P> So no Pirates of the Caribbean ride ? Not yet . But give it time .
