Originally from Brooklyn , long settled in Connecticut , Esther Friesner clearly finds Americans interesting . In recent years , she has written about New Englanders ( " How to Make Unicorn Pie " ) , Texans ( " Just Another Cowboy " ) , and a Japanese exchange student in the US ( " Why I Want to Come to Brewer College " ) . Her last story in our pages was " I Killed Them in Vegas " ( Sept. 2003 ) . Now she digs up some of this country 's roots and replants them in her own garden ( which one might say is-in the best way-lushly enriched by the chief fertilizer used in tall tales ) . See if you do n't find the results most tasty ... <p> SUPPER 'LL BE READY IN just a lick , young'ns , so quit your fussin " and I 'll tell you the tale of Johnny Beansprout , may he burn in hell . Now this here yarn commences way back in the early days of this great nation of ours , back when these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth that decent countries would n't keep on hand , less'n they ran outa likely participants for a good ol " up-country hangin ' . Johnny Beansprout 's folks come over from England , which is enough of a setback for most people . But they could n't leave well enough alone . No sir , they had to go and make their initial handicap all the more worse'n it was to begin with by being vegetarians . Now I know what you 're all gon na say : You 're gon na say , " Uncle Paisley , what 's the use of being at the top of the food chain less'n we gets to chew on the flesh , bones , sinews , and assorted organ meats of our natural inferiors ? " Well , children , that is precisely what the neighbors said to Johnny 's kin . Then they et " em . Those were hard times . Anyhow , when the neighbors come by and et up Johnny Beansprout 's immediate family , they made the mistake of their lives : They did n't eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him being just a tender baby at the time , and them 's good eatin ' . I do n't need to tell a fine , healthy , smart-as-a-whip passel of young'ns like you that when it comes to vittles , ai n't nothing beats baby , both for taste and convenience . Most folks knew that bit o " common sense long before the learned Dean Jonathan Swift wrote up A Modest Proposal for the edification and nutrition of the Irish . I hate to think what might 've become of that noble nation if they 'd had to rely on something so chancy as vegetables . Put not your trust in princes or potatoes . " Course I have heard tell as how the family what devoured Johnny Beansprout 's blood kin was mostly Scots , fresh come to America and pretty much greenhorns . Us real Americans all know how strange those folk can be when it comes to vittles . Any nation that 'd put a haggis on the table sooner'n an infant has got them some problems . Afore we go any further , you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny Beansprout 's story out there , particularly the part about how come he survived when his family did n't . Stories are a lot like cats : One basic model , but let the varmints breed and you wind up with more variations than you can shake a stick at . ( And believe me , you 'll want to , and a might big stick at that . ) Also , they tend to come wandering in and start socializing with people if you leave the back door open too wide for too long . One of the ways I heard Johnny 's tale told was that the mother of the neighbor family what et his folks had just lost a baby of her own , likely through inattention to details , and so her heart was hungrier than her belly . She was the one who heard the infant Johnny a-weepin " and a-wailin " in his cradle and scooped him up outa there before anyone could set a tooth to " im . She kept him hid just a little while , " cause she knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's birth family , stuffed fatter'n a wallow of tax collectors , he 'd be safe enough . So little Johnny was raised by the Bean family , but he never did fit in . All of the young'ns he was raised with - the ones he believed was his real , true sisters and brothers - they was all big , strapping louts and loutesses , due to having been raised on a strict diet of meat , harvested off the yearly crop of travelers on the road that passed by the Bean homestead . They was mostly Presbyterians , for some reason , and there 's a lot of fine white meat on a Presbyterian . But Johnny was nothing like his adoptive kin . Why , that boy was the puniest , scrawniest , sickliest little runt that ever drew a wheezy breath . Many 's the time his oldest brother , Sawney Jr. , would ask the woman they both called Mama " How come our Johnny 's such a pitiful thing ? Why , if he 's any kind of a Bean , it 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how they all would laugh . All of them except for Johnny . He was a broody sort . Mopish . Melancholy . Finally turned to reading-did you ever hear the like ? - and that made a bad situation worse . You can have a good education or a good digestion , but not both , and Johnny made his choice . His mama felt sorry for the boy , sorry and just a mite guilty , knowing what she did about his true family background and all . She was forever encouraging him to go out and play in the fresh air with his brothers and sisters , to say nothing of saving him all the best cuts off the Sunday roast . Johnny did n't seem to care " bout all her motherly kindnesses . he was a sullen boy and a picky eater . Why , sometimes whole months would go by without a scrap of meat passing his lips . It was just as if he knew , somewhere deep inside that stringy flesh , all the way down to the tasty and nutritious marrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . We got us a saying in these parts : It 's all good until the cow-pats hit the mechanical device for the rotary circulation of air . It 's not what you 'd call ahandy saying , but it 's true . Even though Johnny 's adoptive mama did all she could , you ca n't fight Fate forever . Sooner or later , the manure is flat-out bound to fly . One rainy day , while Johnny 's adoptive family had all gone out to check the traffic on the Boston Post Road - checking out their choices for the entree du jour , if you 're gon na be fancy-pants about it - the boy got bored . Like I said , he could read , but the problem with that was there was n't a whole lot worth reading in the Bean house . Once you 'd gone through the Bible and the labels on all of Grandpa Bean 's patent medicines , that was pretty much it . Or so Johnny thought until he found the book . No one knew how a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the Bean house . It was almost as if it had just appeared out of thin air , though with more than a passing tang of sulfur and brimstone a-clingin " to it . ( Folks say that the Devil finds work for idle hands to do , so it 's not much of a wonder to learn that Old Scratch got into publishing . ) Johnny did n't care was that book writ in the blood of the Archfiend himself : He was so desperate bored he began to read it . And what a tale that cursed book had to tell , to be sure ! Children , I do n't want y'all to go home and have your sleep tore up by horrors , but the truth must be told : It was a cookbook . A vegetarian cookbook . By the time the Beans come home again , the damage was done : Little Johnny was hunched over that work of the Devil , a-smackin " his lips and a-lickin " his chops . Mama Bean saw what 'd happened and got all upset . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though for the life of her she could not say how it had managed to traverse the ground between Johnny 's old homestead and her house . Could be one of the Bean boys had taken it along to use for kindling , them being raised to be proper religious and all . Ai n't nothing so warms the soul of the righteous as a burning book . Thing is , they never got around to tossing this particular book on the fire and the pernicious object slipped between the cracks as it were . Oh , she tried to take the book away from little Johnny , but it was too late ; the Devil had claimed his own . Johnny held onto the consarned thing like a bulldog , sometimes bellering " bout why could n't he keep it , sometimes whining " bout how he wanted to whip up some of those zucchini recipes " cause they sounded mighty tasty . Zucchini recipes . If that ai n't proof of hell , I do n't know what is . In the end , Mama Bean gave up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help her wrest the book from the boy 's grasp easy enough , but she neglected her proper parental duties and just let the whole thing slide . Likely she told herself that if she did n't make a big fuss about it , he 'd soon enough grow weary of the book on his own . ( I can not begin to tell you how many parents have fallen for that comforting lie , nor how many have subsequently woke up to the truth that the only effective way to have a child turn from wicked doings is for the parents themselves to pitch in and participate in the same , with a level of enthusiasm guaranteed to embarrass the child past bearing . ) So she let him keep the book and all was peace . For a time . The years rolled on and little Johnny grew to young manhood . He never mentioned the book again , and in fact it seemed to have dropped back into whatever sidepocket of oblivion had spawned it . Truth to tell , Johnny himself changed something powerful since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartier , more robust and handsome . He was still a picky eater , but apparently it agreed with him because you could n't argue with muscles like that . His brothers tried , and they got their noses bloodied for " em . His mama was just as pleased as Punch by all this and was even commencing to gaze out upon the prospect of a rosy future for her adoptive young'n when , as the saying goes , the other shoe fell . It fell right into the middle of a Sunday dinner , though by this time little Johnny 's sixteenth birthday - the economic situation in this great nation of ours had improved to the point where most folks was no longer on a first-name basis with the Sabbath roast . " Mama , " Johnny said , standing up at his place . " Daddy , I got something to tell you . " The whole family froze where they sat . When a Bean rose from his seat during Sunday dinner , it was usually to announce an imminent marriage or birth , sometimes both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear Johnny 's adoptive kin riffling through their mental picture files of every passable young woman for miles around , checking each image for the telltale bulge of a skirt or h'ist of an apron . Before the tension got to be too bad - or before the kinfolk ran out of possible human females and started reviewing images of the more sweetfaced sheep on the farmstead - Johnny himself broke the rest of the news : " I 'm leaving . " " But why , Johnny ? Why ? " Mama Bean cried out in anguish . " How can you say that ? Where will you go ? What will you live on ? " " How soon can you leave and can I have your mattress ? " his brother Angus asked eagerly . Mama Bean hit him with the serving ladle . " Mama , " Johnny said , solemn . " I know the truth . I 've known it for years , now . You and Pa and the rest , you ai n't no more my kin than ol " Reliable over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch lay sprawled on the hearthstones . " How did you find out ? " Mama Bean asked . You could hear her dear old heart cracking just a little more with every word she said . So Johnny told " em all how he 'd read that pernicious book cover to cover ( I think it was called To Serve Manioc or some such nonsense ) and when he come to the end of it he found a couple-three sheets of foolscap tucked into the back of the book . They was a letter that his birth-mamar was writing to her kin back in England , describing her newborn son , and she 'd even tried her hand at a little pencil sketch of the child . Now , one newborn baby looks a whole lot like the next , but Johnny come into this world with a birthmark on the left side of his face that kind of set him apart . It was about the size and shape of a lima bean , and his birth-mama had rendered it so perfect in her sketch that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I thought this meant I was a Hue Bean , " Johnny said , touching the birthmark that was still plain as day to see . " Guess I was wrong . After I read that letter , I took to nosing around through the woods , searching for the place where I was born . " He lowered his eyes . " I found it . It was the most gruesome sight that I ever did see . " An uneasy silence fell over the table . The older Beans could surmise all too well what Johnny had found in his old home . Mama Bean reached across the table to swat her shiftless brother with the ladle and hiss , " I thought we told you to bury the leftovers . " The family was still bickering " bout who 'd been s'posed to cover shovelin " duty on that long-gone day when , all sly-like , Johnny slipped out the back door and hit the road . He took nothing more with him but a change of socks , a knife , a spoon , a cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two zucchinis tied up in a big ol " blue kerchief . Oh , and that book . He sure as hell must 've took that blasted book . Ai n't no one man on this Earth capable of doing as much harm as Johnny did unless he 's got a good book at his back , guiding him on his thrice-cussed way . His folks did n't hear from him none , at first . Mama Bean told the neighbors she was sorely grieved by the certainty that her little foster boy had likely met his Maker in the person of a mountain lion , a hostile tribe of Injuns , or even a distant branch of his own kinfolks . Though times was gettin " better for America , there was still more'n a few families who clung to the old dietary habits , out of tradition if not need . Tradition makes a man do many a damfool thing . I hear tell they willingly eat a dish of lyesoaked codfish out Minnesota way come Christmas " cause it 's tradition . Lutefisk , they call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can make a haggis look good . If that do n't rest my case , I do n't know what does . Well , Mama Bean learned better , soon enough . Was n't no one , man or beast , had et her Johnny . Might 've been better for her and the rest of the family if someone had . She was b'ilin " laundry the day the gov'ment men showed up to arrest her and the whole clan . Pa Bean and the boys put up a mighty fine fight , but there was just too many troops set out ag'in " " em . They were put in chains like common criminals and dragged all the way to Washington D. of C. where they stood trial for having lived off the neighbors . Did you ever hear the like , young'ns ? Now what was this great nation of ours founded for if not to teach us to support one another ? They were tried and convicted and hanged by the neck until no longer gamytasting , and for what ? For what they , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And they call this a democracy ! I know , I know : That was long ago . That 's no longer the way it is nowadays . Shoot , these times they can pitch you into the hoosegow for what you choose to eat or drink or smoke or otherwise introduce to your own personal body , and it 's all legal , thanks to Johnny 's meddling ways . Oh yes , it was Johnny 's doing even then , the way they lit on the Bean clan and dragged " em off to their deaths . The ugly little onion-sucker made it his bidness to turn his adoptive family in to the Authorities before headin " west . They say you can still walk the path that Johnny Beansprout trod when he set out for the great American frontier . He tried to shuck all kinship and connection to the Bean clan , but life 's a funny thing : He wound up being known by a name that harks right back to our shared lineage anyhow , never mind how little he or us cared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call him Beansprout on account of how freely he handed out all manner of sprouting green things , and how he preached the benefits of vegetables , and how he punched the daylights out of the first man who called him Johnny Zucchini . Wherever he went , he planted . Sometimes it was beans , sometimes it was corn , sometimes it was potatoes , sometimes it was okra and other works of the Devil , but mostly it was zucchini squash . Those first two what he took with him from the ol " Bean homestead spread their insidious , imperialist seed all across the land . So did Johnny . There 's many a farmin " family from the Appalachians to the Rockies and beyond what owes their start to Johnny having his wicked way with plowing their fields ; by day and their daughters by night . They say that he 's the reason that we 're such a hale and healthy nation . They say that vegetables are good for you . They say that too much meat 'll rush you into your grave quicker'n a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damfool things . They also say Johnny 's why the South and the North mended fences once the South stopped needing slaves to grow cotton and turned to zucchini farming . That blasted stuff seems to plant itself . Once one plantation gave it a try , the others could n't help but follow , mostly because the vines took over every acre of arable land for miles around . So the slaves was all freed and some found employment right there in the south , riding herd on the zucchini so 's it did n't get too unruly ( though they was a mite too late to save the kudzu vine from extinction ) . Those that did n't choose to stay on headed west , hoping to find Mas " Johnny and thank him . The rest headed east , to work in the big zucchini-bread factories of Boston and Baltimore and New York , or north to Canada where a man could still get him a pork chop without a lecture . Y'see , that was the trouble with what Johnny done : It wouldn't 've been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't stop there . Johnny spread his doctrine almost as broadcast as he spread his seed , to the point where folks was terrified to look breakfast in the eye just in case it come from a critter capable of looking back . Pretty soon , he was what you might call apolitical influence in the land , with a numerous following of fellow-vegetarians . They formed the Misery Loves Company party and as soon as enough vote-finagling thimbleriggers and power-hungry pettifoggers sniffed which way the barbecue-free wind was blowing , they had them a solid legislative representation in Washington . Folks who was too mealy-livered to eat a nice slice of liver for meals could n't stand to see their neighbors chowing down on cows " stead of compost . I guess they reckoned that if they had to suffer , everyone was going to share in the privilege . And it goes without saying that all of Johnny 's descendants chose to cast their ballots the way they figured that randy old bastard 'd want " em to . That was when they started making their laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress as part and parcel of supporting our boys in the Injun Wars . Anyone heard you 'd dared to put a bite of beefsteak in your mouth on a Monday and you 'd find yourself facing a bunch of truncheon-wielding " real Americans " ready to make sure you would n't be able to chew anything harder'n mashed potatoes come Tuesday . And once we rolled over and played dead on that law , it was easy to tack on Turkeyless Tuesdays , Steak-free Sundays , Sausageless Saturdays , Wienerless Wednesdays , Don't-Eat-Nothin ' **34;1674;TOOLONG Fridays , until by the time our boys was fighting the Boche in the trenches of France , they was doing it on sheer guts and tofu . I fail to understand human nature . If a grown , supposedly rational man chooses to give up something he likes - something that 's tasty or interesting or just plain fun to do - why ca n't he leave it at that ? Ai n't nobody forced Johnny Beansprout to live on rabbit food . So why in tarnation did he and his fool followers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beansprout bandwagon , sometimes at gunpoint ? Never mind , young'ns , we all know the answer to that one : For our own good . If'n I had me a nickel for every time someone 's used their Godgiven right to free choice as an excuse to take away mine , I 'd be a rich man . If'n those busybodying , brain-sucking , Beansproutist bullyboys shoved any more of my own good down my throat , I 'd have to shoot myself out of pure joy . So that 's how come we 're living how , as , and where we are today : Right in the seat of power , Washington D. of C. itself . Only seat you 'll ever encounter what 's got more'n one sphincter to it , like my Great-granddaddy used to say . That 's his daddy 's picture hangin " up there on the wall . We 're all mighty proud of him . Was n't many folks could afford to have themselves a real live portrait painted back in them days , but seeing as how it was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he got it . Them 's his last words under the picture , done all pretty in a sampler by my Great-granny 's own hand , back when she was just a slip of a girl : I Et Him And I 'm Glad . Words to live by . What 's that , young'ns ? Who 'd he eat ? Why , who do you think ? Yep , it was one of those whatd'youcaU'ems , a big ol " historical coincidence . Kind of like a fluke , but classier . Seems it was a mighty harsh winter out Californy way , and Great-great-granddaddy 's wagon train got themselves snowed in on the road west just like the Donners , only not half so fortunate . Great-great-granddaddy Bean went out as part of a scouting party sent to fetch help , but he was the only one as made it any appreciable distance . It was rough going and short rations , even for a resourceful man " like him , and it looked like he was about to die and go to waste - unlike the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but an old , grizzled tramp coming up the mountain trail in his direction . That white-haired coot had him a saucepan on his head , a lima beanshaped birthmark on his left cheek , and a pair of zucchinis in his hands which he was brandishing in a perilous manner . The way Great-great-granddaddy told it in his affy-david , that old feller grinned like he had the lockjaw and hollered , " It 's a good thing I found you , friend ! Now you 're safe . You come right on back to my cabin and we 'll get you fixed up fine . There 's plenty to eat there , believe you me . " And so there was . Great-great-granddaddy might 've got away with eating who he did , but family ways is hard to shake . Like his proud ancestors afore him , he was just too consarned lazy to dispose of the leftovers proper . It all came to light with the spring thaw . They say a nation mourned when they heard that Johnny Beansprout was dead and down the hatch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played on that sorrow like a cheap fiddle to push through all manner of new anti-meat laws . Finally this great country of ours come to the sorry pass we are at today , with otherwise honest folk doing twenty years to life for possession of a slice of salami and our finest young men and women running off " cross the border to live in the Free All-Beef Republic of Texas . Well , that 's all water under the slaughterhouse sluice-gate , like my daddy used to say . Maybe America 's hog-tied six ways from Sunday-thanks to the Know-nothings letting the **33;1710;TOOLONG types have their wicked way with our laws and our lives , but this is still a democracy . I 'm a loyal American , a registered voter , and I firmly believe that if one pesky mouthful like Johnny Beansprout could get our proud nation into this meatless mess , imagine what all of us , in this one little family alone , can do to get us out again . Why , shucks , it 's just a matter of being in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mite to put the country back on the right track , one congressman at a time . But here 's your mama calling us to the table , and not a minute too soon . I 'm so hungry , I could eat a raw rutabaga , and I 'll bet you young'ns feel the same . Guess I 'll save the political chin-wag to cool my after-dinner cappuccino . Lord , we thank Thee for the bounty which Thou hast seen fit to set before us on every hand , which kind of makes up for our family having to live down here in the basement of this fine national monument while we do our small part to restore our beloved nation to where she should be . Amen and God bless America . Donal , pass the senator .
