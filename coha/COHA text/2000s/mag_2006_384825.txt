Actor and icon , husband and father-MICHAEL J. FOX has played many roles in life . His latest , as America 's leading activist for Parkinson 's research , represents his greatest challenge . By Leslie Bennetts // BOBBING LIKE A CORK buffeted by roiling waters , he surges into the room , his elfin body alive with motion . Arms , legs , hands , fingers , feet-all are moving ceaselessly , but each operates in a different pattern , speed and rhythm , as if commanded by separate control centers engaged in some mysterious competition . That famous face , beloved by American movie and television audiences for more than two decades , remains preternaturally boyish , but it 's clear that being Michael J. Fox is a challenging role these days . At forty-five , Fox has spent the past sixteen years coping with Parkinson 's disease- " a progressive , degenerative and incurable neurological disorder . " as he puts it in his best-selling 2002 memoir , Lucky Man . Despite his illness , that choice of title reflects his philosophy of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . because 1 know this is really hard for a lot of people , and it 's hard for me physically , and emotionally sometimes , " Fox acknowledges . " But it 's become clear to me that I 'm really lucky . The stuff I have-my wife , Tracy ; my kids ; my career : the experiences I 've had ; the effect I 've had I 've gotten a lot , for one human being . The shaking and the not always being able to do what I want to do-it 's not that bad . I do n't feel anger ; I do n't feel fear . I have a full life . I do n't look at the world through PD-colored glasses . I look at the world the way I 've always looked at the world : I feel really lucky . " Although Parkinson 's most often afflicts the elderly , Fox is among the 5 to 10 percent of patients who develop symptoms before age forty . " The young-onset community has a unique responsibility to use our energy to be proactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heightened his sense of obligation . " If I did n't work again , it would be okay , and that 's huge . My situation is unique . I do n't have to worry about health insurance or losing my job or the other big issues that most people with Parkinson 's have to deal with . So it 's freed me up to do this stuff . " " This stuff " is his typically self-deprecating way of describing the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson 's Research , which he founded in 2000 . Since then , the New York-based organization has raised and distributed S70 million-a considerable achievement by any measure , although Fox is modest in describing his contribution . " I 'm not so much a philanthropist as an encourager of philanthropy , " he says . During the past six years . Fox has become a leading advocate for Parkinson 's research , but less than a decade ago such visibility seemed unthinkable . By the time he was twenty-four . Fox had catapulted to fame and riches as the star of the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Future . His first symptom of Parkinson 's was an uncontrollable tremor in his left pinkie finger that manifested itself in 1990 . He was only thirty when the disease was diagnosed a year later . Afraid that his career would be wrecked if the news got out , Fox spent the next seven years hiding his illness before finally revealing that he had Farkinson 's . " It was betraying me on so many levels , " he says . " I 'd make appointments and not be able to keep them ; I was keeping audiences waiting . People were being let down by me. and I could n't tell them why . At the time , my motive for going public was really selfish ; it was about making my life more comfortable . I had built everything around this central element , and then I realized , I do n't need to hide this . It was a big relief . " The reaction was overwhelmingly positive . " I ca n't begin to quantify the amount of support and affection that I felt and that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's awareness of his problem also had a downside . " People ask , ' How are you doing ? ' and you look in their eyes and you see fear , " he reports . " On more than one occasion I ended up reassuring the other person , because it 's a scary thing . I always used to have people looking at me like , ' Wow , you 've got it made ! ' Now I get people looking at me like , ' Wow , what have you got ? ' You start feeling like . ' How bad is this ? ' At the same time you 're getting up every day , and you have the same set of issues you always did , plus this . It just added a new dimension to who I was . " Fox 's private journey as a Parkinson 's patient began to evolve into a public campaign in 1999 , when he was asked to testify before Congress in support of increased funding for research into the disease . Because he was a star , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recognizing the impact he could have , he found himself wrestling with a daunting question : " Do n't I have a responsibility to do something about this , whether I want to or not ? " As Fox learned more about Parkinson 's research , he was troubled by his growing awareness of unmet needs . " I met a lot of scientists who said . ' We 're limited only by money and manpower . We know where we 're going . We just need to be able to do it , ' " Fox reports . " So I thought . What can I do ? Public visibility is like currency , and in order not to devalue it , I needed to be careful about how I spent it . I can raise money for research , but where 's it going to go ? I realized that I needed to design something that seeks out the best places to put funding , because if people are going to give money through me , then I have a real responsibility to know where every penny goes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " From the outset , Fox was driven by a recognition of what was n't being accomplished elsewhere . " There were big institutions that were covering big things , like the National Institutes of Health , but we wanted to speed up the review process and to reward risk , " he explains . " I knew I wanted to take an entrepreneurial approach , to look at it like a start-up . It seemed to me that to catch the stuff that was falling through the cracks , what was needed was a Navy SEAL-type thing-an extremely narrowly focused , guerrilla-warfare , ad hoc research group . We could be specific about it and say , ' We want to create a dopaminergic cell line ' -a line of stem cells that create dopamine-or ' We want to work on identifying Parkinson 's through hiomarkers . ' " In addition to funding research , another priority for the foundation is " convening-getting people together , " as Fox puts it . " We host and run fifteen to twenty scientific meetings a year , " says Deborah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its goals reflect Fox 's sense of urgency about promoting research designed to get results that can reach patients more quickly than generally happens on the long-term timelines that characterize large bureaucracies . " We need a new paradigm in which institutions and researchers are encouraged to look for clinical applications of what they do , " Fox says . " We 're conditioned to want things to fall out of the sky , hut they do n't fall out of the sky . They have to be grown . We have to create a kind of hydroponic greenhouse to grow them . " But dealing with the government can be an exasperating process , and Fox was particularly dismayed by President Bush 's 2001 decision to allow federal funding for research only on stem-cell lines that had already been extracted from embryos-a compromise that imposed severe limitations on future research . " I know I 'm not the first Mr. Smith to go to Washington and get worked up , but the biggest frustration was coming face-to-face with political expediency , " Fox says . " On the issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no political upside to that ; it wo n't result in votes for them . An issue like stem cells can bite you on the ass , so you see the deals being made to satisfy a certain part of the constituency . And as a result , something that 's potentially so important and groundbreaking and paradigm-shifting becomes a chip in the game . " No matter what obstacles he faces , however , Fox remains resolutely upbeat . " I do think in terms of a cure , " he admits . " In the bliss of not being a scientist , I can look at things simplistically . We 're not there yet , but we 've made a lot of progress . Our understanding of things is growing exponentially . However far we have to go , I do believe this stuff is going to happen in our lifetime . " His positive approach also helps inspire those around him . " He believes in hope and in a constructive outlook , " says Brooks . " He remains extremely optimistic . It is his nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles . " My health is good , " he says , his limbs twitching and jerking in the constant ballet of movement his kids describe as " wiggles . " Although the advance of Parkinson 's is inexorable , the disease progresses in gradual increments that may not be apparent over the short run . " It 's hard for me to judge it , " Fox admits . " It 's different today than it was yesterday , and it 's different than it will be tomorrow . It 's a really unpredictable condition . There is no universal experience , and there is no universal treatment . It 's very individual , and even for me it changes all the time . " Indeed , Fox can be transformed from one hour to the next . As we sit and talk in his private office on Manhattan 's Upper East Side , his body begins to quiet down ; by the end of u long morning , its chaotic bursts of motion are largely stilled , as if the demented marionette-masters jerking his limbs around had gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respite . " For some people , the medication stops working , or the side effects get so terrible that it 's a lose-lose proposition , " he notes . " I 've been very lucky , because it 's been working for me for years . " He tries to schedule his appointments to maximize the periods when he can function productively , hut the tricky business of timing his medications is far from an exact science . " It 's not the kind of thing where you can take a pill every four hours , " he says . " It tells you when , and if you miss it , you can go into an ' off . ' We talk about off and on in terms of whether the miss are working . If you 're off , depending on what you want to do , you could he shut down for an hour , and then the medication kicks in and it 's great for a couple of hours . You just have to catch it . " Although the constant guessing game is inconvenient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere logistical challenge . " The only thing I really miss is the lack of spontaneity-the loss of , ' Hey , let 's jump in the car and go to Vegas ! ' Because I do n't really know how I 'm going to feel in half an hour , " he explains . " In acting , I may make a simpler physical choice than I might have , because I do n't know , forty-five minutes from now , if I 'm going to be able to unscrew the cap on the bottle or whatever . But I 've found that if I do n't panic and go crazy , there 's no vacuum - if you lose something , it will be filled with something . So the lack of spontaneity has been replaced by the chance to consider what I 'm going to do . If it 's tough to leap , then you 've got to look before you leap . Before , I might have just leaped . " In his younger years . Fox did a lot of heedless leaping . By his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk , carousing and brawling before recognizing that he had a drinking problem and giving up alcohol in 1992 . When he talks about his younger self now , his tone is both humorous and disparaging . " I was the schmucky kid who went from not having a date in high school to having a Ferrari when I was twenty-five , " he says . " I was pigging out with all that stuff . I was an idiot in a lot of ways . I was living in this kind of bubble of rarefied air . With this career , you ca n't really say , ' How does this affect me in the real world ? ' because I do n't live in the real world . " Parkinson 's provides a dose of reality that even wealth and celebrity can not mitigate , and Fox believes his personal growth was hastened by the rigors of his illness . " Getting out of yourself is an essential part of everyone 's maturation , " he observes . " When you become comfortable enough to step out of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're doing , you see that you 've got the understanding and opportunity to do something . I ca n't say that I would be doing this if this had n't happened to me , but a sense of civic responsibility and maturity was really growing in me during that time . You start to think about tilings like ' From those to whom much is given , much is expected . ' " For those interested in creating foundations or other charitable institutions , Fox offers a short list of pointers as focused as the goals of his own organization . " One is to be really specific about what you want to do , " he advises . " If we had one foot in the advocacy pond and one in caregiving and one in research , we 'd never get anywhere . Two is to find people you can trust . I have no management skills , but I realized I only had to be smart enough to find people who are smarter than me and keep them close . And three is always to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career has waned since he left Spin City in 2000 , although he played a dying multimillionaire on Boston Legal this past winter . These days his children take top priority . " Even my most important foundation things will be preempted by something with my family , " he says . For the past eighteen years , Fox has been married to the actress Tracy Pollan , who played his girlfriend on Family Ties and in the movie Bright Lights , Big City . They have four children : seventeen-yearold Sam ; eleven-year-old twins Aquinnah and Schuyler ; and four-year-old Esm . " We do all the same things everyone else does , " Fox says . " We go to parent meetings at school , we shop , we cook , we socialize-it 's just life . We love our life and our family . " But the foundation has given a larger purpose and meaning to his existence . " When you see somebody who needs help , I think there 's a point in your life when you help them and you feel , ' Wow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " You do n't think , ' Wow , they were really lucky I was here ! ' " he says . " I just think a switch Hips . The vast majority of us are pretty good people who want to help out . You can broaden the idea of philanthropy to include acts of kindness . First be kind ; be empathetic . Then , when the time is right to do something , you 'll do it . " For Fox , the rewards have been rich indeed . " The other day I was in a synagogue-I 'm not Jewish , but everyone in my world is-and the rabbi said , ' Who had a great week ? ' " Fox reports . " I put my hand up , and Tracy asked , ' What 's so great about your week ? ' " He grins . " I said , Tm here . It was a great week . ' " Sidebar Michael J.
