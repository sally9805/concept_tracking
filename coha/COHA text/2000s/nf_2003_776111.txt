THE ROOTS OF COMMERCIALIZATION // It is one of the unwritten , and commonly unspoken commonplaces lying at the root // of modern academic policy that the various universities are competitors for the // traffic of merchantable instruction in much the same fashion as rival // establishments in the retail trade compete for custom. - Thorstein Veblen , // The Higher Learning in America : A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities // by Businessmen ( 1918 ) // Toward the end of the twentieth century , American universities-with their stately buildings , tree-lined quadrangles , and slightly disheveled , often-preoccupied professors-found themselves in an enviable position . No longer quiet enclaves removed from the busy world , they had emerged as the nation 's chief source for the three ingredients most essential to continued growth and prosperity : highly trained specialists , expert knowledge , and scientific advances others could transform into valuable new products or life-saving treatments and cures . // This newfound importance brought growing interest from the media , increased funding from government agencies and foundations , and closer scrutiny from public officials . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that they could sell the right to use their scientific discoveries to industry and find corporations willing to pay a tidy sum to sponsor courses delivered by Internet or cable television . Apparel firms offered money to have colleges place the corporate logo on their athletic uniforms or , conversely , to put the university 's name on caps and sweatshirts sold to the public . Faculty members began to bear such titles as Yahoo Professor of Computer Science or K-Mart Professor of Marketing . The University of Tennessee , in a coup of sorts , reportedly sold its school color to a paint company hoping to find customers wishing to share in the magic of the college 's football team by daubing their homes with " Tennessee Orange . " One enterprising university even succeeded in finding advertisers willing to pay for the right to place their signs above the urinals in its men 's rooms . // Commercial practices may have become more obvious , but they are hardly a new phenomenon in American higher education . By the early 1900s , the University of Chicago was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania had established a " Bureau of Publicity " to increase its visibility . In 1905 , Harvard was concerned enough about its profitable football team to hire a 26-year-old coach at a salary equal to that of its president and twice the amount paid to its full professors . As President Andrew Draper of the University of Illinois observed , the university " is a business concern as well as a moral and intellectual instrumentality , and if business methods are not applied to its management , it will break down . " // What is new about today 's commercial practices is not their existence but their unprecedented size and scope . Before 1970 , university presidents may have sounded like hucksters on occasion and resorted at times to advertising and other methods borrowed from the world of business . Nevertheless , commercialization in the strict sense of the term-that is , efforts to sell the work of universities for a profit-was largely confined to the periphery of campus life : to athletic programs and , in a few institutions , to correspondence schools and extension programs . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the university by professors of computer science , biochemistry , corporate finance , and numerous other departments . Entrepreneurship is no longer the exclusive province of athletics departments and development offices ; it has taken hold in science faculties , business schools , continuing education divisions , and other academic units across the campus . // What accounts for the growth of commercial activity in institutions dedicated to higher learning ? To Veblen , the obvious culprits were university presidents and their entourage of bureaucratic helpers . Intent upon accumulating money to expand the size and reputation of the institution , campus administrators were forever forcing the methods of the marketplace on a reluctant community of scholars . In Veblen 's view , the remedy for the disease was as obvious as its cause : " The academic executive and all his works are an anathema and should be discontinued by the simple expedient of wiping him off the slate . " // If Veblen harbored any doubts about the reasons for commercialization , he did not acknowledge them . Even in his day , however , it should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the academic bureaucracy . More than a few university presidents protested the growth of football programs , only to be overcome by the tidal force of enthusiastic students and alumni . Today , it is even more apparent that the recent surge in money-making activity on campus stems from causes far deeper than policies emanating from the president . University officials have surely initiated entrepreneurial ventures . But they often have little or nothing to do with the efforts of prominent professors to found their own companies , sell their services as teachers to corporations , or allow private companies to market their lectures through the Internet , tape , or videocassette . Nor is there any doubt that the greatest obstacles to reforming intercollegiate athletics continue to lie , not in the president 's office , but among the alumni supporters , boosters , legislators , and others who insist on fielding winning teams . // If Veblen was wrong in heaping so much blame on university presidents , what else helps account for the recent burst of commercial activity on campus ? Part of the explanation lies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has plainly taken root , not only in higher education , but also in many other areas of American life and culture : health care , museums , public schools , even religion . Entrepreneurial initiative , high executive salaries , and aggressive marketing techniques are all spreading to fields of endeavor quite outside the realm of business . Such practices set examples that legitimate the use of similar methods in universities . Nevertheless , merely noting the existence of a trend does not explain why it came about , let alone account for its sudden and deep penetration into an academic culture long considered an " ivory tower " set apart from the marketplace . // Several scholars have attributed the recent growth of money-making activity to a lack of purpose in the university . Having lost sight of any clear mission beyond a vague commitment to " excellence , " our sprawling multiversities are charged with creating a vacuum into which material pursuits have rushed in unimpeded . Explanations of this kind almost invariably come from philosophers , literary scholars , and other humanists . Although they talk expansively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanities . Since these are the fields of study most widely accused of having lost their intellectual moorings , it is not surprising that their professors see a similar aimlessness as the cause of other ills that have overtaken the academy . // If one looks more broadly at the university , however , one quickly finds that many faculties and departments are quite clear about their purposes and that these are the very parts of the institution in which commercialization is most rampant . Within the traditional disciplines , no faculty members feel a stronger sense of mission than the scientists , yet it is there-not in the humanities-that commercialization has taken hold most firmly . Among the several faculties , none has a clearer sense of purpose than schools of business and medicine , yet it is their professors-not their colleagues in literature and philosophy-who are most deeply involved in lucrative consulting and entrepreneurial activity . // If there is an intellectual confusion in the academy that encourages commercialization , it is a confusion over means rather than ends . To keep profit-seeking within reasonable bounds , a university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue its goals with a high degree of quality and integrity . When the values become blurred and begin to lose their hold , the urge to make money quickly spreads throughout the institution . Just what these values are and how they are threatened by commercial pursuits are subjects discussed in subsequent chapters . For the moment , it is enough to say that loss of purpose is not a useful explanation for the recent growth of money-making ventures in the university . // Critics from the left have a different theory to explain the burgeoning commercial activity on campus . To them , such behavior is simply another illustration of the attempts by the businessmen and lawyers who sit on boards of trustees to " commodify " education and research , reduce the faculty to the status of employees , and ultimately , make the university serve the interests of corporate America . // The influence of the private economy on the university is undeniable . Wealthy donors clearly alter the shape of the institution through the power of their benefactions . Anyone harboring doubts on this score need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most schools of education and social work . The world of commerce and industry affects the curriculum in even more striking ways through the jobs it provides and the salaries it offers ; witness the growth of undergraduate business majors , the rise of computer science departments , and the generous compensation offered to professors of management and economics , compared to that paid to colleagues in literature and philosophy . // It is one thing , however , to note the effects of the economy on academic institutions and quite another to imagine a plot on the part of business leaders to bend universities to their corporate purposes . It is true that toward the end of the nineteenth century , as American colleges transformed themselves into large research institutions , clergymen began to give way to business executives and lawyers on most university boards . Still , ascribing this trend to some sort of national corporate plot seems rather farfetched ; there is a more benign explanation . As institutions of higher learning grew larger and more complicated , they needed trustees who could help them raise money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped for these tasks and were increasingly out of step , in any case , with faculties that were steadily becoming more secular and professional . Business executives and corporate lawyers simply seemed better suited to the changing needs of the university . // In the early years , some business-oriented trustees did try to impose their views on the institution , even to the point of firing faculty members with radical opinions . But professors soon organized to protest such interference . Eventually , board members had to modify their behavior and defer to scholarly judgments in academic matters or risk doing harm to the reputation of their university . Long before the recent wave of commercialization , therefore , trustees of major universities had become far less intrusive . By the 1960s , they were serving , as they do now , largely out of loyalty to their alma mater or from a sense of civic duty , rarely interfering with academic decisions except where necessary to guard the financial health of the institution . Today , if trustees encourage commercial ventures , they are far more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's needs rather than to promote the selfish interests of American business . // Professors of higher education offer a different explanation for the growth of commercial activity on campus . In their view , the recent wave of entrepreneurial behavior is a response to the reductions in government support for higher education that began in the 1970s . As the economy slowed after the energy crisis of 1973 , Congress could no longer sustain the rapid increases in research funding that occurred during the 1950s and 1960s . State legislatures , burdened by the mounting costs of prisons , welfare , and health care for the indigent , followed suit and cut their appropriations for higher education , especially in the 1980s and 1990s . The result , according to this theory , was to force university officials and faculty members to look for new sources of funding . Eventually , enterprising presidents and entrepreneurial professors found ways to market their specialized knowledge and scientific discoveries in return for the cash they needed to make up for declining state support . // Government cutbacks may well be the precipitating cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia , Scandinavia , and Holland to become more entrepreneurial . In the United States , however , funding cuts are not the whole story . After all , the past two decades are hardly the first time that American higher education has experienced financial difficulties . Government funding slowed or declined in the early 1970s , not to mention the 1930s , yet universities did not respond with a burst of profit-seeking ventures . // Moreover , private universities in America have been no less entrepreneurial than their public counterparts even though few of them have had much state funding to lose , and most have seen their endowments surge during the heady stock market booms of the 1980s and 1990s . Basic biomedical scientists have been among the more enterprising in the academy , notwithstanding continued real increases in research support from the National Institutes of Health . Business schools and their faculties have pursued new money-making ventures with notable zeal despite having suffered few , if any , of the financial cutbacks that have beset other parts of the university . In short , declining appropriations may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain the rise of entrepreneurial activity on American campuses during the last twenty years . // Universities share one characteristic with compulsive gamblers and exiled royalty : there is never enough money to satisfy their desires . Faculty and students are forever developing new interests and ambitions , most of which cost money . The prices of books and journals rise relentlessly . Better and more costly technology and scientific apparatus constantly appear and must be acquired to stay at the cutting edge . Presidents and deans are anxious to satisfy as many of these needs as they can , for their reputation depends on pleasing the faculty , preserving the standing of the institution , and building a legacy through the development of new programs . //
