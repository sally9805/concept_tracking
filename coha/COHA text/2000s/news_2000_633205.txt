<p> My life is a juggling act . I 'm a single mother of two sons ; I 've got a busy work schedule and limited resources . But there is one thing I do n't worry about : When I come home at night , dinner is already started . A typical weeknight at my house looks like this : <p> My youngest child is snapping the ends off the green beans . <p> My eldest is mixing up his secret salad dressing . <p> The baby-sitter is working on the shopping list for tomorrow 's dinner  --  a lasagna the kids want to make . <p> I throw on an apron , send the baby-sitter home and join my kids in the preparations for dinner . <p> Sound too far-fetched for your home ? It does n't have to be . If my family can do it , any family can . <p> Our meals were n't always such happy group efforts . Seven years ago , my life was shattered by divorce , leaving me with a 6-month-old infant and a very angry 7-year-old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The burden of rebuilding my career as a food writer and publicist and caring for my children seemed insurmountable . <p> While I did my best to work during my youngest 's nap times , by day 's end I was physically exhausted and emotionally depleted . Typically I shooed the boys out of the kitchen so I could perform yet another chore  --  making dinner . When I got the meal on the table , I left them to eat alone so I could have five minutes ' peace . Retreating to my bedroom , I collapsed onto my bed and cried . I felt horrible about my family life and and helpless to change it . <p> A year passed , but not much improved . At the end of my rope , one evening I thrust some basil at my youngest , who was then 18 months old , so he 'd leave me alone . <p> Lo and behold , he spent 10 minutes happily tearing the basil into little pieces . I was shocked at how he stayed on the task without uttering a peep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help me and I sure needed help . Why not let him cook with me ? <p> So he and his older brother began doing lots of tasks in the kitchen : peeling vegetables , grating cheese , pushing the blender and food processor buttons , plucking the leaves from herbs , tearing up salad greens , kneading dough , stirring risotto and even helping me make homemade pasta ! <p> It was incredible what they could be persuaded to do  --  all because I invited them into the process and believed in their ability to really help . <p> Yes , it got messy at times . And at first I would feel rushed and I often sabotaged the moment by grabbing something away because they were taking so long . <p> Then I realized I no longer had any reason to be in a hurry . As long as the kids were with me in the kitchen , they were not whining about dinner . They were busy and content . <p> I decided to stop worrying about the mess or about the time it took to cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick to it , I decided to enjoy the process of cooking with my kids and not worry about the meal itself being perfect . <p> We started to laugh a lot at dinner time . And my eldest son began to rely on that time of the day to share his worries and fears . We would talk about tutors and help for him in school , and , over time , his problems lessened . He was getting the quality time he needed . <p> With this mind-set , you wo n't make the mistake of getting tense and impatient , grabbing food or tools away from the kids because they 're too slow . The kids wo n't end up running off in tears . You 'll just be talking , going along cooking , and soon you 'll realize that new lines of communication and strong bonds are forming . <p> Family cooking has another tangible reward . The meal will be prepared and you 'll actually want to sit at the table and enjoy it together .
