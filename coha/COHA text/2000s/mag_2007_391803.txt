Two years ago , 5-month-old Cody Schmurr died from multiple congenital myopathy-a rare condition that made his muscles so weak he could not exhale the carbon dioxide from his lungs . Doctors told Cody 's parents , Tracy and Steve Schmurr , that there was a one in three chance that their next child might suffer from the same problem . For the Livermore , Calif. , couple , it was a risk worth taking . " I did n't want to ever turn back and say , " I wish we would have ' ' , " says Tracy . " Even the five months with Cody were the best five months of my life . " In June 2006 , 13 months after Cody 's death , Tracy delivered a healthy baby boy named Levi . Every year , about 25,000 kids under age 10 die , most from congenital anomalies , unintentional injury ( mainly car accidents ) , premature birth and cancer . It is the ultimate tragedy : kids are n't supposed to pass away before their parents . But sometimes they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some point , evaluates whether they should have another child , " says Kristin James , bereavement counselor at Children 's Memorial Hospital in Chicago . " When that loss occurs , they 're suddenly incomplete . You 've defined yourself as a family of five , and now you 're a family of four . " The fear factor ( will another child die , too ? ) often looms large . The loss of a child can put tremendous stress on even the best marriages and the closest families . " Losing a kid makes you lose faith in life , " says child psychiatrist Alvin Rosenfeld . " To reclaim that faith in living , that it 's worth doing this again , is an act of enormous courage . " No one knows how many parents gather that courage-or how they fare . It 's difficult to study . " You certainly ca n't randomly assign people to have a child or not have a child , " says Douglas Hawkins , a pediatric oncologist at Seattle Children 's Hospital . Yet , anecdotally , many experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The most profound attachment in human life is mother and child , " says John Golenski , executive director of the George Mark Children 's House , a residential facility in San Leandro , Calif. , for kids with terminal illnesses and their families . " The best adaptation to the loss of a child is another attachment . " Still , another attachment is not for everyone . " Some families are willing to risk anything to hold a healthy baby . Some families ca n't imagine going through that pain again , " says James . " It 's very hard to convince them that this wo n't happen again . Their bubble of what they think is safe and normal is forever shattered . " Even if they want to conceive again , some couples run into fertility problems . These families may-or may not-decide to adopt . For one couple , the decision was made easier by their children , including their dying son . On Christmas Day in 1997 , Joey Albrecht , 8 , died of a rare pediatric cancer . " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got to heaven , he was going to tell God to send us a baby , " says his mother , Cheryl Albrecht . Right after the funeral , Cheryl 's daughter , Kelly , now 21 , said , " Mom , the house is so quiet . Can we have another baby ? " The answer : yes . In January 1999 , Cheryl gave birth to Julia , now 8 , followed by Nick , now 7 . Cheryl remembers seeing Julia 's heart beat on the ultrasound . " I thought , " Oh , my God , my heart is starting to grow again ' ' , " she says . " I can love again . There is going to be happiness in my life . " Such feelings cause some parents to feel guilty . " What I do hear a lot is the feeling of , " Am I betraying my child who died ? ' " says Barbara Sourkes , director of the pediatric palliative-care program at Lucile Packard Children 's Hospital at Stanford . " " How can I throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who died behind ? ' " Cheryl Albrecht says Julia and Nick have not replaced her Joey . " But they helped us love again and helped us keep happy , " she says . All parents worry about their kids ' health and safety-more so when they 've lost a child . Michelle and Bill McGowan 's daughter Katie died last year , just before her first birthday . ( She was born with a blockage in her intestine . ) Four months ago , the McGowans , of Glenview , Ill. , had a healthy baby boy , John . Michelle still attends a support group at Children 's Memorial in Chicago , where moms talk about their fears that other offspring will die . " As a mom anyway , you can be paranoid . Now I 'm paranoid to the nth degree , " says McGowan . Even her older kids , Kylie , now 4 , and Bill , now 6 , worry . One day Kylie , concerned about John 's getting a cold , said , " We ca n't touch him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John would be OK . And every week after church , they visit Katie 's gravestone , with a small butterfly etched at the top of the cross . ( Experts say this sort of ritual is normal . ) Michelle tells her kids , " Sometimes butterflies fly away , and you do n't see them again . " But sometimes they stay-and sometimes new ones are born . photo : A NEW LIFE : Tracy and Steve Schmurr , at home with their baby , Levi PHOTOGRAPH BY GABRIELA HASBUN FOR NEWSWEEK <p>
