It has got so psychologist Lawrence Josephs can tell right away which patients are likely to fire him . The narcissists may be the worst . These are the ones who are there in the first place only because their spouse would not quit hectoring them to show more interest in the marriage , and the people at work just did n't seem to give them the credit or attention they deserve . Often , they stay only long enough to decide that what they really need is to leave the marriage and quit the job . After that , they sack the shrink . <P> " They come in under duress , " says Josephs , a psychology professor at Adelphi University in Garden City , N.Y . " But they do n't commit . What they really want is to have everything on their own terms . " <P> If it 's any comfort to Josephs , he 's not alone in having such trouble managing narcissists  --  and it 's not just the narcissists giving therapists such problems . Narcissism is one of 10 conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by most accounts , narcissists are among psychology 's toughest nuts to crack . Talk therapy often does n't touch them ; drug therapy may do just as little . Researchers know why . <P> Common mental conditions , such as anxiety disorders , eating disorders and depression , can be thought of as a pathological rind wrapped around an intact core . Peel the skin away through talk therapy or melt it away with drugs , and the problem may abate . Personality disorders , by contrast , are marbleized through the entire temperament . Narcissists may be self-absorbed , but they believe they jolly well have a right to be . Histrionic personalities may make too much of things , but how else can they be heard ? It 's hard enough to persuade most people to see a therapist  --  harder still when the patient denies there 's a problem at all . " People rarely come in with a self-diagnosed personality disorder , " says Josephs . " Friends and family push them into it . " <P> These days they have more reason than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societal pressures grow , experts say they are seeing more cases of personality disorder than ever . As much as 9% of the population is thought to suffer from some kind of personality disorder , and as many as 20% of all mental-health hospitalizations may be the result of such conditions . Epidemiologists have not done a very good job of comparing these figures with those of earlier years , but many doctors report  --  anecdotally  --  that their PD caseload is indeed on the rise . " The more severe ones are increasing , " says Josephs , " especially among people who grew up in homes with divorce or drug and alcohol problems . " <P> As this happens , more and more researchers are looking for new ways to treat the conditions  --  exploring both genetic and environmental roots , seeking both therapeutic and chemical cures . And well they might . " The social costs of personality disorders are huge , " says Dr. John Gunderson , director of the Personality Disorders Service at McLean Hospital in Belmont , Mass . " These people are involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse , violence . The problem is tremendous . "
