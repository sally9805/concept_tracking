Section : This Week The search for water-splitting materials brightens up <p> In his 1874 science fiction tale The Mysterious Island , Jules Verne predicted , " Water will be the coal of the future . " It is a vision of infinite clean energy available for people to use . More than 30 years ago , Japanese scientists took a seminal step in that direction . With a piece of titanium dioxide and some sunlight , they split water into hydrogen and oxygen . Although researchers have tried to refine the process over the years , nobody has come up with a system that is both efficient and inexpensive enough to produce sufficient hydrogen for use as a clean-burning fuel on the roads , in industry , and at home . Recently , however , researchers have picked up the pace of their pursuit of the ultimate water-splitting system . <p> With rising oil prices and the specter of climate change that 's due to the burning of fossil fuel , the vision of a hydrogen economy looms ever larger in people 's minds . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is water . And hydrogen packs more energy per unit mass than any fossil fuel does . <p> " The conversion to hydrogen has already started . It 's inevitable , " says Nejat Veziroglu , director of the Clean Energy Research Institute at the University of Miami . <p> But the main source of hydrogen today is natural gas , a non-renewable resource . And the steam-based process for extracting hydrogen from the gas generates carbon dioxide-one of the primary global warming gases . To circumvent these problems , scientists are exploring alternative strategies . Among them are photosynthetic microbes that churn out hydrogen ( SN : 10/12/02 , p. 235 ) and electromechanical systems that use the electricity from wind turbines to make hydrogen from water ( SN : 7/21/01 , p. 45 ) . <p> However , many scientists contend that catalytic materials that use sunlight to split water on the spot , a process known as direct solar-hydrogen production , could be the most promising strategy . In solar-hydrogen systems , when photons strike the catalytic material , they excite electrons , which then roam about freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . The extra electrons strip the two hydrogen atoms away from water 's one oxygen atom , producing hydrogen fuel . The oxygen atom simultaneously hooks up with another oxygen atom , forming an oxygen molecule . <p> Not only is sunlight readily available , " you do n't need a lot of water to make hydrogen fuel , " says John Turner of the Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colo . If all the 230 million cars and other light-duty vehicles in the United States were running on hydrogen , 100 billion gallons of water per year would be sufficient to supply the fuel , Turner says . The nation 's households collectively consume almost that much water in just a week of drinking , cooking , and washing . <p> What 's sorely missing , however , is a water-splitting material that 's simultaneously efficient , inexpensive , and stable . Whoever invents a substance that meets all three criteria will add momentum toward a hydrogen economy , revving up progress to highway speeds . <p> MIX IT UP The most widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same stuff used to make white paint . Titanium dioxide is great at splitting water , but it absorbs only ultraviolet ( UV ) light , which constitutes a scant few percent of the solar energy reaching Earth 's surface . Researchers have tried with some success to increase titanium dioxide 's efficiency by spicing it with different elements . Other chemists are instead layering different light-absorbing materials to combine the best of each into one device that taps the broad band of energy the sun offers . <p> Several years ago , Turner and his colleagues created such a layered device by placing gallium indium phosphide , which absorbs ultraviolet and visible light , on top of gallium arsenide , which absorbs infrared lights ( SN : 4/18/98 , p. 246 ) . The resulting device could convert 12.5 percent of sunlight 's energy into the production of hydrogen . This was a feat of efficiency , but " the materials are expensive and they only last about 20 hours " before corroding , says Turner . <p> To speed up the discovery of suitable materials , chemical engineers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robotics-intensive strategy known as combinatorial chemistry , the same approach that pharmaceutical chemists take to synthesize and test new drugs . Led by Eric McFarland , the group designed a system that can rapidly synthesize 120 different materials and test each one 's water-splitting capacity , all in a single day . <p> The system works in the following way . First , the researchers coat a 4-inch-square glass plate with titanium foil to serve as an electrode . They next add a thick layer of Teflon perforated with 120 holes . The researchers then fill the holes with different preformulated solutions containing a dissolved semiconductor material mixed with various metals . For instance , the base semiconductor might have zinc oxide or tungsten oxide , and each sample would be doped with differing proportions of , nickel , copper , or chromium . <p> In a process called electrodeposition , a robotic instrument dips an electrode into each solution one by one , causing the dissolved materials to form a thin solid film on the titanium-coated glass . Peeling away the Teflon leaves behind 120 thin dots of material , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-splitting potential of the newly created films , a second robotic instrument lowers a tiny chamber onto each dot and fills the chamber with a conductive aqueous solution , or electrolyte . The robot then shines light on the chamber and measures the current the film generates . By repeating this quick test on each film , the robot screens the entire array in a matter of hours . <p> The greater the current produced by a film when illuminated , the more electrons it gives up , and therefore the greater its potential to split water and generate hydrogen . <p> This technique amounts to an efficient form of trial-and-error . " We can afford to try all sorts of wacky things , " says Thomas Jaramillo , one of the investigators working on the project . " That 's the real power of this technology . " <p> It also enables the researchers to take inexpensive semiconductors such as zinc oxide and tweak them to improve their properties . Already , the Santa Barbara team has seen some promising results . <p> The researchers found that when they added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.5 percent cobalt by weight , they boosted the zinc oxide 's current-generating capacity fourfold . The extra cobalt enables the material to absorb a larger part of the solar spectrum and thereby free up more electrons , explains Jaramillo . <p> IN TANDEM Changing a material 's chemistry is just one way of devising new candidates for use in solar-hydrogen production . With the advent of nanotechnology , scientists have come to recognize that tweaking a material 's fine structure can have dramatic effects . Take the so-called tandem cell invented by Michael Grtzel of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne , a leader in the field of photovoltaics . <p> The tandem cell consists of two separate but electrically connected light-absorbing materials , one of which splits water . The water-splitting material faces the sun and consists of a thin film of either tungsten trioxide or iron oxide in front of a sheet of conducting glass . The back material is a photovoltaic device known as a Grtzel cell ( SN : 12/20 &27/03,; p. 398 ) . <p> The nanoscale structure of the metal-oxide film is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of 50 to 100 loosely packed layers of metal-oxide spheres , each about 20 nanometers in diameter . This geometry provides a vast amount of surface-1,000 times as great as its two-dimensional area . The small spheres also make the material more chemically reactive than it would be in bulk form . <p> When exposed to sunlight , the nanostructured film absorbs UV and blue light . The rest of the spectrum passes through the material to be absorbed by the Grtzel cell . That solar cell provides extra electrons that make the water splitting more efficient . <p> In September , Hydrogen Solar-a British company that 's working with Grtzel to develop the technology-announced that its tandem cell with the nanostructured film had achieved 8 percent efficiency . This marked a doubling of the performance of earlier devices without the nanostructured film . The firm says it is close to reaching the U. S. Department of Energy 's efficiency goal of 10 percent , says David Auty , chief executive of Hydrogen Solar , which is headquartered in Guilford , England . That 's the benchmark for commercial viability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tandem cells on the rooftops of home garages . The cells would provide drivers with hydrogen for their fuel cell vehicles . These vehicles would consume hydrogen and produce water , essentially reversing the process that generated the hydrogen in the first place . <p> A rooftop unit working with 10 percent efficiency in a sunny Southern California location could generate enough hydrogen to drive 11,000 miles per year in the small Mercedes-Benz fuel cell car that went on the market in Germany in June , says Auty . To generate larger amounts of fuel , tandem cells could cover the roofs of factories and even central fueling stations , from which trucks would transport hydrogen across the country . This scenario would still require practical solutions for the transportation of this highly explosive gas . <p> With funding from the Department of Energy , Hydrogen Solar is collaborating with the University of Nevada at Las Vegas to develop its technology . The company plans to have a pilot fueling station up and running near the campus in 3 years . <p> Auty concedes that hydrogen from tandem cells , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice of much as hydrogen produced from natural gas . But the price of natural gas fluctuates widely , he says . What 's more , unlike the method used to extract hydrogen from natural gas , the tandem-cell technique does n't generate carbon dioxide . <p> Like many people in the industry , Auty anticipates that regulations eventually will dictate that oil and gas companies capture and sequester the carbon dioxide they generate . " I do n't think anyone knows just how much extra it 's going to cost , but it 's certainly going to add to the price of the fuel , " he says . <p> And that , Auty adds , should help make solar hydrogen more economical . <p> MOLECULAR MACHINES While Hydrogen Solar continues to refine its materials , other groups are pursuing a different approach . These investigators are engineering complex molecular machines that can split water using solar energy . <p> Consider the work of Karen Brewer of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg . She says the reason it 's been so difficult to make efficient solar hydrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strip off its hydrogen atoms . Her lab is developing molecular structures that can deliver multiple electrons simultaneously to a central reaction center , which then catalyzes the splitting of water . <p> Many of the other solar-hydrogen materials are inefficient in gathering up the two electrons needed to split water . Because the reaction is thus energy intensive , materials such as titanium dioxide work only under high-energy UV light . By designing materials at the molecular scale , Brewer says she can build greater efficiency into the system . For instance , she has designed molecular complexes that absorb visible light and thereby tap into energy carried in a larger part of the solar spectrum . <p> The Virginia Tech team tested different combinations of components over many years before it created successful supramolecular complexes . " We figured it out through an awful lot of work and a lot of wrong choices along the way , " says Brewer . Her group presented its results in August at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia . <p> Brewer 's molecular complexes mimic natural photosynthesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components , comprises three main units . A chemical bridge connects each of the two light-absorbing units to a catalytic central unit . <p> The light-absorbing units contain ruthenium atoms . As in a chlorophyll molecule , a photon hitting a ruthenium atom excites one of its electrons . The electron is then shuttled to the central unit , which contains a rhodium atom . The rhodium collects electrons , two at a time , to perform the reaction . <p> To ensure that the excited , mobilized electrons would gather in the central unit , the researchers designed the complex 's chemical bridges to attract the electrons from the light-absorbing segments and shuttle them in the right direction . Once the team got the bridges in order , the next challenge was finding a metal for the central catalytic unit that would be strong enough to pull the electrons . " The problem initially was that the electrons would just sit there on the bridges , " says Brewer . <p> Eventually , the team found the answer in rhodium . " This has been a major breakthrough for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong electron acceptor , but it 's also reactive enough to split water and it 's stable . In short , it could be just right for making solar-hydrogen systems . <p> The researchers have done preliminary experiments in which they mixed the molecular complexes with water in a glass vial and exposed the vial to visible light . Soon thereafter , hydrogen began to bubble from the system . These initial studies indicate that the efficiency of the system is already " reasonable , " Brewer says . <p> As the world begins to shift toward a hydrogen economy , other hydrogen-generating technologies initially might win out over solar-generated hydrogen . " Countries will use whatever source is cheapest at the time , " says Veziroglu . " It may be natural gas , coal , wind , or hydropower , but eventually , it will be solar energy . " <p> And if water and sunlight are all it takes , then Jules Verne 's fantasy of burning water like coal will have been realized . <p> DIAGRAM : Diagram shows that photovoltaic material behind the film converts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device with extra voltage to boost hydrogen production . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : SUNNY OUTLOOK . Future consumers may produce their own hydrogen thanks to materials that use the sun 's energy to strip hydrogen from water . A rooftop array of water-splitting panels might produce enough hydrogen , routed to a garage tank , to power a fuel cell car . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : BUBBLING WITH HYDROGEN . In this tandem cell , a nanostructured metal-oxide film absorbs the sun 's ultraviolet and blue light to split water . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : MOLECULAR POWER .
