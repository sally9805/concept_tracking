<p> Trolley wires : Responses to " Down to a wire , " Metro , April 10 <p> Streetcars ran far in old days <p> There is a reason that the picture you paint of an almost wireless system sounds so nice ; it 's because there will be only one line . <p> As a native of Atlanta and 80 years young , I fondly recall my daily rides on the streetcars . Sure there were wires galore , but the cars ran on almost all of the major streets both north and south and east and west . <p> Two interurban lines ran to the square in Marietta , and to the foot of Stone Mountain . Atlanta does n't come close to having anything like that today . <p> EUGENE D. RHODES , Roswell <p> Portland system hums along nicely <p> I often rode the double overhead wired electric buses in downtown Atlanta years ago . Certainly the wires were unappealing and the bus contacts frequently came off track . Believe me , the Portland , Ore. , system is completely different . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't notice much . The quiet steady hum of the electric motor is about it . Much neater and cleaner than our MARTA buses . And , as a bonus , the Portland light rail system ( MAX ) uses exactly the same type of overhead wiring system , making it as clean and pleasant as the trolley . In fact , I prefer the slightly larger light rail cars that provide free service throughout Portland 's downtown area . It is clearly a system Atlanta should emulate . <p> ROBERT J. AUGUSTINE , Atlanta <p> Look to the future , not to 19th century science <p> The suggested mass transit component within the proposed makeover for the city of Atlanta suggests that the leadership has lost direction and talked themselves into a new folly : an electric trolley . Why would a billion-dollar-plus makeover for the city have at its center a people-moving system based on 19th century science ? <p> Georgia 's electricity , even in a single overhead electric wire , is derived primarily from coal-fired plants . These plants pour tons of pollutants into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Georgia mountains , which then dissipates into the Earth 's atmosphere . Electric trolleys do not send a message of responsible global citizenship , nor are they good for our health . <p> Atlantans , it 's time to speak up and demand our leadership do better ! Atlanta leaders , it 's time to look to the future . <p> STEPHEN OPPENHEIMER , Atlanta <p> On being rich : Responses to " Not rich ? Look in the mirror , " @issue , April 10 <p> It 's not envy , it 's desperation for non-wealthy <p> Reading guest columnist Lance Martin 's Emerald City analysis of wealth disparity in America left me speechless . It was like hearing the person next to you on the bus assert that the Earth is flat or the bus is a flying saucer . Since Martin is too far over the rainbow to ever return , I ask you to consider a few real-world things that lead to wealth disparity . <p> First , many of the wealthy have inherited their wealth and will continue to do so , especially if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was largely built by manufacturing jobs that have disappeared without the consent of the workers . No amount of good choices by a steel furnace operator could have forestalled that . Yes , corporations do create jobs but increasingly in Mumbai and Shanghai , and the CEOs make hundreds of times more than do the average workers . Lastly , the wealthy are far more able to absorb routine crises like a $2,000 car or home repair , not to mention much better health insurance . <p> Stuck in Oz , poor Martin combines the qualities of both Tinman and Scarecrow , lacking heart and brain . Here in Kansas , it seems that no matter how hard you work or plan , you are always in danger of being pulled backward by the sucking winds that you can not control . <p> It 's not envy , Martin ; it 's fear of getting locked out of the storm cellar . <p> ROBIN McDOWELL , Atlanta <p> The fight is n't for money , simply for time <p> I see from the bio details that Lance Martin is an employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent firing of thousands of workers because they were too experienced and the company did n't want to keep paying their salaries ? Probably by finding a way to blame the employees . <p> Unlikely as it may sound , many people still go into important fields like teaching , police and fire protection , home health care , social work , the military , newspaper journalism and a number of other professions even though those careers are n't known as paths to riches . Could it be they have other motivations besides financial gain or envy over material goods ? . <p> For many , the fight is n't even over money , but time . For a better balance between work and life outside of work . And they 've given up on employers who talk the talk but do n't walk the walk . And if taxes are what 's strangling Americans , then why do countries that rival or beat the United States in the U.N . quality of life measures consistently have higher , not lower , taxes ? Yes , most countries do have lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be almost all in the Third World . Which is the direction the political right has been slowly taking us . Maybe they 're just hoping we blame ourselves along the way . <p> RUSTY CARTMILL , Alpharetta <p> Fascist police became crooks in poker raid <p> Criminals brazenly barged into a nice Roswell home in a quiet neighborhood on Monday and kidnapped 27 people , swiped all their money and stole all their cars . The criminals will never be prosecuted . They are the police ( " Roswell police fold up high-stakes poker club , " Page One , April 11 ) . <p> In what has become a regular feature of life in America , bad laws against victimless crime ( such as poker games ) turn would-be good cops into bad cops  --  into criminals . <p> The fact that such fascist actions do not unsettle citizens who pride themselves on liberty is disconcerting at best , and terrifying , at least . <p> DAVID ELMORE , Roswell <p> Dump the DFCS slackers <p> Chairwoman Mary Burns and the Department of Human Resources ' board of directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems at hand ( " Fulton DFCS report mishandled , " Letters , April 9 ) . <p> For many years , the Department of Family and Children Services has operated under the secrecy of confidentiality . The whole system uses this confidentiality  --  which is supposed to protect children  --  to its advantage . The arrangement makes them immune from public scrutiny or responsibility to the taxpayers who pay their salaries . Finally we have the Child Advocate , Dee Sims , trying to tell the truth and she is drawn and quartered by the board . <p> The board , like Gov . Sonny Perdue , seems not to be interested in what is best for Georgia 's children , only in politics . They only seem interested in protecting the status quo , keeping secrets and protecting their own behinds for not overseeing DFCS like they should have . What exactly do these people do ? Sounds like this group needs to be replaced , and soon ! <p> JOY ROOKS , Brunswick <p> Afghan women need more than a perm <p> The interview with Deborah Rodriguez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goes Behind the Veil " ( " Author believes ' God put me on this earth ' to operate a beauty school in Afghanistan , " Living , April 10 ) may give readers a false impression of life for Afghan women . <p> Afghans have a life expectancy of 47 years and an average annual income of $250 . Only 21 percent of the adult female population can read and write . <p> The rights guaranteed women and girls in Afghanistan are a far cry from what we enjoy in the West . The story made Rodriguez 's adventure in Afghanistan appear to be just that  --  an adventure . <p> While I am sure that a " Kabul Beauty School " is a welcome addition to Afghanistan 's capital city , I would suggest a far better gift to Kabul would be a public school , clean water , medical care or food . I agree with Rodriguez that Afghan women are amazingly beautiful and strong . But they need more support than dyes and perms . <p> GAYLE R. HOFFMAN , Smyrna <p> There 's room for compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing will be solved without negotiation and compromise , perhaps Congress should send the president a war-funding bill for one-half the amount he 's asking for and split the time-limit difference in the last House and Senate bills and stick with it . <p> If he refuses to sign it , then it will be him cutting funding for the troops and all that goes with them continuing a losing battle and no progress being made . <p> Why not ? <p> GEORGE FIELDS , Decatur <p> What will you do when they come for your job ? <p> In the story " What 's the price for legal residency " ( Page One , April 10 ) , it states about illegal aliens : " Many harvest onions , hang Sheetrock or spread pine straw for less than $10 an hour . " <p> I 'm an American citizen and father who watched as his wages for hanging Sheetrock dropped 45 percent in the last 15 years , even while prices rose by a similar percentage . <p> It finally got so bad that I started my own business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business as well , because I refuse to break the law and hire illegal workers , perpetuating the problem . <p> Americans need to realize that every job being done by illegal aliens used to be done by Americans , at a livable wage . Yet none of those savings in labor costs have been realized by the consumer ; they 've only translated into bigger profits for the companies that break the law to employ illegals . <p> What will you do when they come for your job ? <p> JEFF HERMANN , Oxford <p> Genocide in Darfur needs to be stopped <p> I read former Ambassador Lawrence Rossin 's essay on Sudan with great interest and am pleased to see The Atlanta Journal-Constitution focusing once again on the genocide in the Darfur region ( " Hit Sudan 's leaders where it hurts : the wallet , " @issue , April 9 ) . <p> The coalition , which includes more than 100 organizations comprised of thousands of Georgians , is in complete agreement with Rossin 's call for action by governmental entities as well as citizens . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop this horrific tragedy immediately . <p> Genocide is not a political issue ; it must never be tolerated nor endorsed . It must cease . <p> KEISHA L.
