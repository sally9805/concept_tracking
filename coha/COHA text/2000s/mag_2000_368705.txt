Only the hardest decisions make it all the way to the President 's desk . That 's something both men who are running have had a chance to see from front-row seats . " It 's a revelation , " says Al Gore , " the way excruciating , world-class problems tend to come in clusters . " And George W. Bush knows from seeing his father renege on his " no new taxes " pledge how a single judgment can end up crippling a presidency . So , says Governor Bush , " you just got ta be confident enough in your positions and tough enough in your hide to be able to stand the heat if it comes . " <P> It is impossible to know precisely what problems George W. Bush or Al Gore will face as President , but there surely will be some that nobody will have anticipated . What is also certain is that the two would bring dramatically different approaches to solving them . Bush comes to a decision by putting his faith in the advisers he picks ; Gore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mastering a new issue is to learn the lay of the land ; Gore is n't convinced he knows the terrain until he runs his fingers through the soil .

His son , on the other hand , became famous in Texas for cutting meetings short , demanding a cogent recommendation from his advisers , making a decision and moving on . Bush also has less patience with the status quo than his father did . If Bush the elder 's governing philosophy was " first , do no harm , " then his son 's is " do something . " Since his first campaign in Texas in 1994 , George W. 's style has been to develop a limited , specific agenda and then focus almost exclusively on it until he could check all the items off the list . " He realizes that if you have too many goals , you do n't have any goals , " says Bush campaign chairman Don Evans .
