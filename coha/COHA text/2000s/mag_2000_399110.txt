Section : Companies , People , Ideas By preempting 20/20 on the Internet , p.r . man Mike Sitrick did n't just get better spin for his client . He took the war against the media into a new dimension . <p> THE CREW FROM THE TELEVISION newsmagazine is banging on your door . You can have the security guard throw them out and know that they 'll trash you for ducking an interview . Or you can sit down with them and figure that of the hour you give them , they 'll use only 40 seconds on air . And those 40 seconds will make you look very guilty . <p> Better solution : Call Los Angeles flack Michael Sitrick . He 'll turn the tables on the newshounds . Sitrick is the guy who posted on the Internet the full video of a contentious interview of his besieged client , diet-pill maker Metabolife International , by ABC 's 20/20  --  before 20/20 had a chance to air it . For Sitrick , 52 , it was the latest in a long string of strong-arm tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to pay him $450 an hour . <p> Anybody in Metabolife 's spot will try to spin or even kill a story before it 's aired or published . But by using the Internet , Sitrick has taken advantage of a direct , unfiltered medium for reaching potentially millions of open minds . Sitrick 's move  --  which included a full-page ad in the New York Times inviting traffic to the Web site  --  has landed him and San Diego-based Metabolife in the major press and on the various chatter and buzz circuits of the wired world . <p> It was a calculated bet that by posting Metabolife 's clash with 20/20 on the Internet , the company would n't hurt its case by drawing yet more attention to a story that otherwise would have escaped most people . That 's a bet that Robert Dilenschneider , the former chief executive officer of Hill &; Knowlton and famed flack for his own impressive rogues ' gallery of clients , would n't have made . " By responding in advance , you 're building an audience for the program , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be negative ? " <p> But it 's a battle out there in the war for public opinion , and more companies are turning to the new breed of hardball players or , as in a recent use of the Internet by Philip Morris USA , finding their own ways to balance negative press . It 's not enough just to seek redress in court afterward . The recent overturning of Food Lion 's fraud case against ABC 's PrimeTime Live further reinforces what most businesses knew already : Do n't count on getting justice after the fact . <p> Sitrick should know : He was also the mastermind behind taking selective outtakes from the PrimeTime Live report and repackaging them into a slick videotape that purported to show how the ABC producers were mischaracterizing many of the hidden camera incidents of unsanitary conditions in Food Lion 's stores . At the time , in 1997 , he only sent out the outtakes tape to selected reporters as evidence of ABC 's alleged deceit ; today he says he would n't hesitate to go straight to the Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " firm in Washington , D.C. that unabashedly hires private detectives to smoke out his clients ' critics , including one supposed grass-roots agitator who was popping up in stories bashing a client 's food additive . In fact , he was a front for a competitor . <p> " In past years , the rule of thumb was , ' Never piss off the media ' , " snarls Dezenhall , author of a new book called Nail ' Em ! about torching irresponsible press reports . " This is classic public relations b.s . It assumes you have a future with the media that is attacking you . You do n't .... There wo n't be any future if the TV show buries you . " <p> Forget defense , in other words ; go on the offensive . If some reporter has it in his head that you make defective gas tanks or your factory is poisoning the lake , do n't settle for " damage control . " <p> When Dezenhall 's firm was working for the folksy Motel 6 chain in 1995 , the company got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give us a spokesman within 48 hours for a piece we 're broadcasting about a couple who were peeped on by motel workers while having sex . The show had already produced the lead-in spot with the couple ; it just needed the corporate sucker for the dramatic televised showdown . <p> Dezenhall bought a little bit of time by having lawyers fire off a threatening letter . Then the dirty work began . A team of forensic investigators tore apart the walls in the room where the couple had stayed . Their conclusion : The " peephole " did n't go through the wall . <p> Meanwhile , Dezenhall 's private dicks discovered that the couple were bunco artists with rap sheets for prior extortion schemes . The Geraldo expose on Motel 6 quietly went away . <p> Tension between business or celebrated figures and the media has been building for years ( see box ) . Many others have tried variations of Sitrick 's approach , though of course without the Internet at their disposal . <p> While head of corporate communications for Nissan North America in 1990 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate flacks . " We 'd like to come out with Ed Bradley next week and interview you about charges of sudden acceleration in the Nissan 280ZX and 300ZX , " Spetner recalls the producer saying . <p> Where did 60 Minutes get the story ? Nissan was pretty sure it knew . The car company was suing a former employee for embezzlement . The employee had responded two months earlier with a letter threatening that if Nissan did n't back off , he would go to the networks with revelations about a scheme at Nissan to cover up safety defects . <p> Spetner had to scramble to stall the story , which could have beaten up Nissan the same way earlier stories about sudden acceleration caused years of grief for Audi . The company dashed off letters to CBS asking , in part , if 60 Minutes had interviewed the embezzler . " We were going to taint everything he touched , " says Spetner . <p> The reply : CBS does n't reveal the names of sources whose interviews are not part of a broadcast . We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to panic , " Spetner recalls . He turned to the Wall Street Journal 's Detroit bureau , promising the newspaper an exclusive on the embezzlement and blackmail scheme if the paper would run its story before 60 Minutes could air its report . In the meantime , Spetner prepared a massive counterattack media campaign . <p> " We could have survived a story about a guy who embezzled money , but would have had difficulty sustaining a major story that called into question the safety of our products , " Spetner says . <p> Fortunately for Spetner , now vice president of corporate communications for AIG 's SunAmerica unit , the stalling worked . By the time Nissan confirmed in depositions that the blackmailer was peddling bogus information , the Gulf war broke out , further delaying the story . Over a year later , after Nissan got a judgment against the guy and won a separate product liability lawsuit over sudden acceleration , 60 Minutes quietly let the story die . Despite doing its own reporting , the Journal did , too , burying the entire tale . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't good enough to put on the air . " <p> Back in the newsroom , the press is feeling the heat . " Holy moly ! " 20/20 segment producer Mary Van Horn recalls thinking to herself when a Wall Street Journal reporter called after being tipped off by Sitrick to the Metabolife Internet scheme . Van Horn and ABC lawyer Elizabeth Schorr did n't want to exhaust FORBES with Sitrick 's voluminous beefs , but they maintain his pugnacious tactics did n't influence the outcome of the Metabolife story . Van Horn says many of Sitrick 's rants are " untrue or misstated , and I found that to be the case quite often while working with him . " <p> Sitrick 's usual technique is to wear down reporters and cast doubt in their minds about sources and documents . If that fails , an attorney 's letter may be sent along to the media outlet . <p> " If you come at me with a fist , I 'm going to hit you back with a brick , " Sitrick snorts in his 1998 self-promoting memoir Spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor willing to knock Metabolife on camera , Sitrick 's team found out and hounded producer Van Horn about the doctor 's connection with something called the Slim-Fast Nutrition Institute , an affiliate of one of Metabolife 's competitors . When he learned that 20/20 would cite Food &; Drug Administration reports of deaths and health risks of a primary ingredient in Metabolife 's hottest-selling product , he whipped out a General Accounting Office study that questions the reliability of the reports . Sitrick 's lead associate on the case , Tony Knight , even deluged Van Horn with a carton of mouse and rat electrocardiograms . <p> By the time 20/20 showed up in San Diego with correspondent Arnold Diaz , Sitrick made sure that his own camera taped the 70-minute interview with Metabolife 's 46-year-old founder , Michael Ellis . It was staged before an auditorium full of fawning company employees . <p> This is n't the way television reporters want to conduct their interviews . But it would have been awkward for 20/20 to refuse to go along  --  and then try to tell viewers that Metabolife had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ground-breaking Web move have any effect on the final story ? ABC 's Van Horn and Schorr insist no . <p> " We do n't need Michael Sitrick to tell ABC News how to report a fair and accurate story , " says Schorr , frequently interrupting a phone conversation to lawyer up a 20/20 report on the dangers of cell phones . " The producers were talking to people with different viewpoints throughout this process . " <p> The 20/20 piece ended up hitting the highlights of the Metabolife controversy , including founder Ellis ' arrest record , the fierce debate in the medical community and the requisite suffering victim ( who 's suing , of course ) . But at the end of the Friday night segment , Sitrick could jump up from his sofa and exult , " Yes ! It 's exactly what I wanted . " <p> At least , that 's his spin on the story .
