The old ark 's a-movering // a-movering // a-movering // the old ark 's a-movering // and I 'm going home . // Nineteenth-century American spiritual // The old ark was a Pan Am jet and I was returning to the United States . The airplane had originated in Johannesburg and stopped in Accra , Ghana , to pick up passengers . // I boarded , wearing traditional West African dress , and sensed myself immediately , and for the first time in years , out of place . A presentiment of unease enveloped me before I could find my seat at the rear of the plane . For the first few minutes I busied myself arranging bags , souvenirs , presents . When I finally settled into my narrow seat , I looked around and became at once aware of the source of my discomfort . I was among more white people than I had seen in four years . During that period I had not once thought of not seeing white people ; there were European , Canadian and white American faculty at the university where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss United Nations personnel , had become my close friends and in fact helped me to raise  --  or better , corral  --  my teenage son . So my upset did not come from seeing the white complexion , but rather , from seeing so much of it at one time . // For the next seven hours , I considered the life I was leaving and the circumstances to which I was returning . I thought of the difference between the faces I had just embraced in farewell and those on the plane who looked at me and other blacks who also boarded in Accra with distaste , if not outright disgust . I thought of my rambunctious nineteen-year-old son , whom I was leaving with a family of Ghanaian friends . I also left him under the watchful eye and , I hoped , tender care of God , who seemed to be the only force capable of controlling him . // My thoughts included the political climate I was leaving . It was a known fact that antigovernment forces were aligning themselves at that very moment to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much adored but also much hated president . The atmosphere was thick with accusations , threats , fear , guilt , greed and capriciousness . Yet at least all the visible participants in that crowded ambience were black , in contrast to the population in the environment to which I was returning . I knew that the air in the United States was no less turbulent than that in Ghana . If my mail and the world newspapers were to be believed , the country was clamoring with riots and pandemonium . The cry of " burn , baby , burn " was loud in the land , and black people had gone from the earlier mode of " sit-in " to " set fire , " and from " march-in " to " break-in. " // Malcolm X , on his last visit to Accra , had announced a desire to create a foundation he called the Organization of African-American Unity . His proposal included taking the plight of the African-Americans to the United Nations and asking the world council to intercede on the part of beleaguered blacks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents that I persuaded myself I should return to the States to help establish the organization . Alice Windom and Vickie Garvin , Sylvia Boone and Julian Mayfield , African-Americans who lived and worked in Ghana , were also immediate supporters . When I informed them that I had started making plans to go back to America to work with Malcolm , they  --  my friends , buddies , pals  --  began to treat me as if I had suddenly become special . They did n't speak quite so loudly around me , they did n't clap my back when laughing ; nor were they as quick to point out my flaws . My stature had definitely increased . // We all read Malcolm 's last letter to me. // Dear Maya , // I was shocked and surprised when your letter arrived but I was also pleased because I only had to wait two months for this one whereas previously I had to wait almost a year . You see I have n't lost my wit . ( smile ) // Your analysis of our people 's tendency to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too far above and beyond them is certainly true . You can communicate because you have plenty of ( soul ) and you always keep your feet firmly rooted on the ground . // I am enclosing some articles that will give you somewhat of an idea of my daily experiences here and you will then be better able to understand why it sometimes takes me a long time to write . I was most pleased to learn that you might be hitting in this direction this year . You are a beautiful writer and a beautiful woman . You know that I will always do my utmost to be helpful to you in any way possible so do n't hesitate . // Signed // Your brother Malcolm // I looked around the plane at the South African faces and thought of Vus Make , my latest husband , from whom I had separated . He and members of the Pan-African Congress and Oliver Tambo , second in command of the African National Congress , really believed they would be able to change the hearts and thereby the actions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them Nation Dreamers . When I thought of Robert Sobukwe , leader of the Pan-African Congress who had languished for years in prison , and Nelson Mandela , who had recently been arrested , I was sure that they would spend their lives sealed away from the world . I had thought that , despite their passion and the rightness of their cause , the two men would become footnotes on the pages of history . // Now , with the new developments about to take place , I felt a little sympathy for the Boers , and congratulated myself and all African-Americans for our courage . The passion my people would exhibit under Malcolm 's leadership was going to help us rid our country of racism once and for all . The Africans in South Africa often said they had been inspired by Martin Luther King , Jr. , and the Montgomery bus boycott of 1958 . Well , we were going to give them something new , something visionary , to look up to . After we had cleansed ourselves and our country of hate , they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example and let freedom ring in their country as it would ring in ours . // Sweet dreams of the future blunted the sharp pain of leaving both my son and the other important man in my life . Given enough time , Guy would eventually grow up and be a fine man , but my romantic other could never fit into my world , nor I into his . // He was a powerful West African who had swept into my life with the urgency of a Southern hurricane . He uprooted my well-planted ideas and blew down all my firmly held beliefs about decorum . // I had been in love many times before I met him , but I had never surrendered myself to anyone . I had given my word and my body , but I had never given my soul . The African had the habit of being obeyed , and he insisted on having all of me . The pleasure I found with him made me unable , or at least unwilling , to refuse . // Within a month of conceding my authority over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormity of my mistake . If I wanted chicken , he said he wanted lamb , and I quickly agreed . If I wanted rice , he wanted yams , and I quickly agreed . He said that I was to go along with whatever he wanted , and I agreed . If I wanted to visit with my friends and he wanted to be alone but not without me , I agreed . // I began to feel the pinch of his close embrace the first time I wanted to sit up and read and he wanted to go to bed . // And , he added , I was needed . // I agreed . // But I thought , " Needed ? " Needed like an extra blanket ? Like air-conditioning ? Like more pepper in the soup ? I resented being thought of as a thing , but I had to admit that I allowed the situation myself and had no reason to be displeased with anyone save myself . // Each time I gave up my chicken for his lamb , I ate less . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , I enjoyed him less . And when I joined him , leaving my book abandoned on the desk , I found I had less appetite for the bedroom . // " You Americans can be bullheaded , stupid and crazy . Why would you kill President Kennedy ? " He did n't hear me say , " I did n't kill the president . " // My return to the United States came at the most opportune time . I could leave my son to his manly development hurdles ; I would leave my great , all-consuming love to his obedient subjects ; and I would return to work with Malcolm X on building the Organization of African-American Unity . // By the time we arrived in New York , I had discarded my vilification of the white racists on the plane and had even begun to feel a little more sorry for them . // I was saddened by their infantile , puerile minds . They could be assured that as soon as we American blacks got our country straight , the Xhosas , Zulus , Matabeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites from the gloom of ignorance into the dazzling light of understanding . // The sound in the airport was startling . The open air in Africa was often loud , with many languages being spoken at once , children crying , drums pounding  --  that had been noise , but at New York 's Idlewild Airport , the din that aggressively penetrated the air , insisting on being heard , was clamor . There were shouts and orders , screams , implorings and demands , horns blaring and voices booming . I found a place beside a wall and leaned against it . I had been away from the cacophony for four years , but now I was home . // After I gathered my senses , I found a telephone booth . // I knew I was not ready for New York 's strenuous energy , but I needed to explain that to my New York friends . I had written Rosa Guy , my supportive sister-friend , and she was expecting me . I also needed to call Abbey Lincoln , the jazz singer , and her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered me a room in their Columbus Avenue apartment that I had refused . But most especially , I had to speak to Malcolm . // His telephone voice caught me off guard . I realized I had never spoken to him on the telephone . // " Maya , so you finally got here . How was the trip ? " His voice was higher-pitched than I expected . // " Fine . " // " You stay at the airport , I 'll be there to pick you up . I 'll leave right now . " // I interrupted . " I 'm going straight to San Francisco . My plane leaves soon . " // " I thought you were coming to work with us in New York . " // " I 'll be back in a month . . . " I explained that I needed to be with my mother and my brother , Bailey , just to get used to being back in the United States . // Malcolm said , " I had to leave my car in the Holland Tunnel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white man 's car . He panicked . I told him who I was , and he said , ' Get down low , I 'll get you out of this . ' You believe that , Maya ? " // I said yes , but I found it hard to do so . " I 'll call you next week when I get my bearings . " // Malcolm said , " Well , let me tell you about Betty and the girls . " I immediately remembered the long nights in Ghana when our group sat and listened to him talk about the struggle , racism , political strategies and social unrest . Then he would speak of Betty . His voice would soften and take on a new melody . We would be told of her great intelligence , of her beauty , of her wit . How funny she was and how faithful . We would hear that she was an adoring mother and a brave and loving wife . // Malcolm said , " She is here now and making a wonderful dinner . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He laughed at his own joke . // I said , " Please give her my regards . I must run for my plane . I 'll call you next week . " // " Do that . Safe trip . " //
