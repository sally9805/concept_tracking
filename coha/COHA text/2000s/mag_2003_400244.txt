The Sybaris Gallery , Royal Oak , MI September 14-October 12,2002 // Presented in the middle of Detroit 's metal stamping industry ( automobiles ) , Harriete Estel Berman 's exhibit expressed exquisite irony . Titled " Identity , " it comprised jewelry and sculpture fashioned primarily from printed metal containers once used as packaging for foodstuff and other mundanities . She designed these pieces , she says , as cautions against " conspicuous consumption . " German is a metalsmith as well as a self-described evangelist for the recycling movement . Berman began working with printed metal 20 years ago , engineering witty full-scale reproductions of the tools of women 's lives : household appliances . Language was an important component of some pieces . In Everyready Working Woman , this title became a brand name in metal script affixed to the side of a brawny electric drill/kitchen mixer , which featured a makeup kit in a hidden compartment . In those early works , Berman expressed the contradictions many women experienced in the 1980s , a time of economic stress that pitted feminist ideals against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traditional " femininity . " Her recent work speaks to wealth and leisure . The " Identity " pieces replicate , in tin and plastic , symbols of affluence recognizable to most American women , from those who collect antiques and fine jewelry to collectors of memorabilia . There were two categories : furnishings such as " period " chairs and a series of teacups ; and jewelry . The centerpiece of the exhibition was Identity Complex , 2002 , a vanity stool in Queen Anne style . Its tufted and " upholstered velvet " seat displays the word " Queens " in gold print several times , along with several images of a strong , flowing  --  haired woman dressed in Tartan period clothing-obviously Mary Queen of Scots on the run . In one appearance she holds a sword loosely in her right hand and looks off to the side . Advertising illustrations of " beauty queens " and the word " Virgin " from a can of olive oil appear on the outer side of the stool 's legs . The inner side of the legs and underside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies- " My breasts are too small , " " I hate my thighs , " and the like . These roughly cut , collaged letters and words resembling Hollywood ransom notes are invisible unless one kneels to look for them . An obvious message , however , is that the stool would collapse under any real woman 's weight . A similar mix of imagery and marketing language from food tins could be seen in other pieces , but all required close observation to sense Berman 's protests , and some , such as the jewelry , could n't be read as protest at all . Two chairs that convincingly imitate the style of the highly collectible Arts and Crafts movement lack the coherence of the vanity stool 's story . Her series of wavering stacks of delicate , decorative teacups and saucers , Consuming Conversations , 2001 , speak mostly of candies , cookies and , possibly , gossip . One stack , however , ends in a somewhat hostile gesture . The top cup , filled with clear solid resin , holds a cut-up " platinum " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The credit card may be the ultimate symbol of the excesses of our time , but 30 years ago women fought hard to gain independent access to credit . The card certainly represents the powerto purchase as well as to take on debt . So one may question Berman 's intent here . Is she discouraging " conspicuous consumption " or seeking to limit women 's access to power ? Many unresolved conflicts are evident in these works , not least of which is Berman 's seeming desire to have her cake and eat it , too . She has impressive technical skills and a knowledge of art and fashion history that she has incorporated here , sometimes with low-key indignation at the exploitation of women for financial gain and at human vanity in general . More often , though , she appears to play at protest , and she seems uncertain about her role as artisan , as well . Her " Identity " necklaces are most beautiful when they play off bar codes , those black-and-white striped emblems indicating product pricing for computerized checkout registers . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising herself " for sale " and conspicuously " consuming " Berman 's high-priced jewelry . Her bracelets , however , are her most ironic pieces . Like cigar bands , they are play jewelry , offering neither message nor intrinsic value in their fragile , hollow tin forms imprinted with gemstones . In these pieces , German seems to be mocking herself . - CAROL NOVAK Photograph All of Harriete Estel Berman 's works are made of printed steel from recycled containers .
