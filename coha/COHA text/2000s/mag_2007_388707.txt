Headnote In August 1976 , a president used the grand stage of Yellowstone to pledge his commitment to the national parks . Three decades later , his words remain as meaningful as ever . As every American certainly knows by now , our nation 's 38th President , Gerald Ford , passed away in the waning days of 2006 . Although Ford is remembered far his endeavors as a collegiate athlete and his role in helping the nation recover from Watergate and Vietnam , few people realize his connection to the National Park Service . Ford was the only President to serve as a park ranger , working as a seasonal employee at Yellowstone in the summer of 1936 . And during his brief time in office , he oversaw the creation of 18 national parks , including Big Cypress National Preserve , Big Thicket National Preserve , and Valley Forge National Historical Park . On August 29th , 1976 , Ford returned to YeUowstone and used the nation 's bicentennial as an opportunity to pledge his support for one of its greatest assets-the National Park System . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sine of the nation 's parks and recreation areas with an investment of $1.5 billion over ten years . It was a promise he was unable to keep , as he lost the presidential election to Jimmy Carter several months later . But as the nation prepares for the centennial of the Park Service in 2016 , the words Ford spoke 30 years ago serve to remind us of the value of investing in " America 's greatest idea . " Labor Day , next weekend , marks the end of a glorious summer . It means one more carefree holiday before we all go back to school , back to work , back to the duties we must do to build better lives for ourselves , our children , and our country . For many families it means one last chance to get out of town , out into the sun , under the stars , close to nature 's beauties and nature 's creatures . For me this is a moment that I have been looking forward to for a long , long time-to return to Yellowstone where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been telling my family about that summer ever since .... And this time , I brought some of the family along . My son , Jack , as you know , is no stranger to Yellowstone . Two years ago this month he was working as a ranger at a tower station-actually , he was out fishing-when he got a sudden summons to come to Washington to see his old man get a new job . So , today , it is a sentimental return to the scene of wonderful memories for two of the Fords and a new experience for my daughter Susan , who hopes to get some good YeIlowstone photographs like she did last summer at Yosemite . Family vacations-especially among the majestic mountains of the West-are a tradition of our family . My parents always took my brothers and myself to lakes and woods in my state of Michigan before I was big enough to go myself as a Boy Scout . There is something wonderful about the wide open spaces that is almost a necessity for Americans . Being alone with nature strengthens our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who live close to the land , this is nothing new . But as more and more Americans live in cities , the lure of the mountains , the beaches , the lakes , the rivers becomes more and more compelling . So , I have a serious as well as a sentimental reason for this visit today . Our Bicentennial Fourth of July turned out to be a very profound experience for millions and millions of Americans . Somehow , despite our difficulties and our differences-perhaps because of them-Americans recaptured the essential spirit and greatness that makes us a very special kind of people . We realized again what a wonderful thing it is just to be an American . As I thought about the changes that have taken place in this great country-not only in the last two years but during the last two centuries-I also thought about those things that must never change . Those unchanging things really make us Americans . They are the things we must pass on to future generations . Some are intangible , invisible-our deep religious and moral convictions , our bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution . But we have other common treasures that are material and visible , that can be damaged and destroyed by man . We must be equally commined to conserve and to cherish our incomparable natural heritage-our wildlife , our air , our waters , and our land , itself . More than a century ago we began to save our natural heritage for the enjoyment of future Americans with the National Park System , of which Yellowstone is the oldest and the largest . This year alone we expect 260 million Americans to visit and enjoy our 287 national parks that spread from the Virgin Islands to Maine to Alaska and to Hawaii . And I am sure there are times when some of you thought that all 260 million people were camping on your camp site . Laughter We have had a wonderful Bicentennial . We celebrated what our patriotic founders and our immigrant ancestors handed down to us . We renewed our vows to their vision of freedom and equality . But I found myself saying we ought to do more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday present to future generations , a gift that will be gratefully remembered 100 years from now ? We can . I , therefore , decided upon a 10-year national commitment to double the expanse of America 's national parks , recreation areas , wildlife sanctuaries , urban parks , and historic sites . I will send to the Congress , Tuesday , a Bicentennial Land Heritage Act , which calls for a pledge of $1500 million during the next 10 years . It will more than double our present acreage of land for national parks , recreation areas , and wildlife sanctuaries ; beginning development of these new lands to make them accessible and enjoyable ; improving facilities and increasing dedicated personnel at existing national parks ; making available $200 million for urban parks ; bringing the benefits of nature to those who live in our cities ; and accelerating the development of parklands and sanctuaries now delayed for lack of manpower and of money . This national commitment means we may have to tighten our belts elsewhere a bit , but it is the soundest investment in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to prevent the loss of treasures that can never be replaced for ourselves , our children , and for future generations of Americans . I call upon all Americans-our Bicentennial generation which has enjoyed the blessings of liberty and the pursuit of happiness , ours for 200 years-to join in a great new undertaking to improve the quality of our lives and of our land .... I remember as a ranger the first time I stood alone on Inspiration Point over at Canyon Station looking out over this beautiful land . I thought to myself how lucky I was that my parents ' and grandparents ' generation had the vision and the determination to save it for us . Now it is our turn to make our own gift outright to those who will come after us , 15 years , 40 years , 100 years from now . I want to be as faithful to my grandchildren 's generation as Old Faithful has been to ours . What better way can we add a new dimension to our third century of freedom ?
