" Zero Waste is a sexy way to talk about garbage , " Haley said . " It gets people excited . " I considered that for a moment . Could we solve our garbage problems by making garbage sexy ? // The Dream of Zero Waste // I had been touring San Francisco 's garbage infrastructure for two days now - prowling around the city 's transfer station , poking into its curbside bins , and following its garbage trucks . My hosts were Bob Besso , who worked for Norcal , the private company with which the city contracted to pick up refuse , and Robert Haley , from the Department of the Environment . Dressed in blue jeans and sneakers , Besso had the lankiness of a marathon runner . He was in his fifties , and he 'd worked in recycling for decades . His and Haley 's easy-going attitude , and their penchant for plain speaking , were diametrically opposed to the formal inscrutability of New York 's sanitation operatives . The best part of hanging around Besso was his competitive streak : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waste . Who could throw out less ? Who had more radically altered their lifestyle to leave a smaller human stain ? // The Zero Waste concept was a growing global phenomenon . Much of Australia had committed to achieving the goal in 2010 , and resolutions had been passed in New Zealand , Toronto , twelve Asia-Pacific nations , Ireland , Scotland , the Haut-Rhin Department in the Alsace region of France , and several California counties . So far , no community had reached this nirvana , a condition perfected only by nature . For humans to achieve zero waste , went the rhetoric , would require not only maximizing recycling and composting , but also minimizing waste , reducing consumption , ending subsidies for waste , and ensuring that products were designed to be either reused , repaired , or recycled back into nature or the marketplace . Zero Waste , said Peter Montague , director of the Environmental Research Foundation , had the potential to " motivate people to change their life styles , demand new products , and insist that corporations and governments behave in new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally . I considered it a guiding principle , a rallying cry for green idealists . I understood its intensive recycling component , but what about goods that simply could not be recycled ? Over lunch in a Vietnamese restaurant , I learned that Zero Waste was n't just rhetoric to Haley . " I do n't have a trash can at work , " he said . On his desk sat a grapefruit sized ball of used staples - ferrous scrap that he could n't bear to throw out . " If I 'm going to be a leader in Zero Waste I have to live the life , " he said . I asked what affect this had on domestic harmony . " My partner is 99.9 percent with me , " he said , nodding enthusiastically . // " What 's the one-tenth-of-a-percent problem ? " // " She draws the line at twist ties . " // " Well you know you could strip the paper from the wires and - " I interrupted myself . Haley already knew how to recycle a twist-tie . At home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landfill . The 5 percent he threw out was " manufactured goods " - recently some beyond-repair leather shoes . Worn out sneakers , of course , were mailed to Nike , which shreds rubber and foam into flooring for gyms . The company accepts non-Nike footwear too , and is also trying to tan leather without questionable toxins and developing shoes made of a new rubber compound that doubled as a biological nutrient - something that could be harmlessly returned to nature . This would be quite an improvement , since according to designer William McDonough conventional rubber soles are stabilized with lead that degrades into the atmosphere and soil as the shoe is worn . Rain sluices this lead dust into sewers , and thence into sludge bound for agricultural fields . According to the National Park Service , which has more than a passing interest in manmade stuff that lies around on the ground , leather shoes abandoned in the backcountry last up to fifty years ( if they are n't eaten , one presumes ) , and rubber boot soles go another thirty . // McDonough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " paper " made of plastic resins and inorganic fillers . The pages are smooth , and waterproof , and the whole thing is theoretically recyclable into other " paper " products . The book weighs one pound , four ounces . A book of comparable length printed on paper made from trees weighs an entire pound less . " What do you think of that ? " I asked Haley . He nearly spit out his mouthful of curried vegetables . " McDonough 's book will be landfilled ! I 'd rather cut down a tree ! " // To Haley and Bob Besso , landfilling was the ultimate evidence of failure . Avoiding the hole in the ground-which in San Francisco 's case was owned by Waste Management , Norcal 's archenemy-had become a game to them , albeit a game with serious consequences . Haley did n't use his paper napkin at the restaurant , and he scraped the last bit of curry from his plate . But we all knew there was waste behind his meal - in the kitchen , on the farm , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choy had been carted to San Francisco . // I wondered if Zero Waste really meant anything , considering the limits of our recycling capability and our reluctance to alter our lifestyles . It was as dreamy an idea as cars that ran on water . And just as appealing to industry , too . " Zero Waste is a sexy way to talk about garbage , " Haley said . " It gets people excited . " I considered that for a moment . Could we solve our garbage problems by making garbage sexy ? // Seeing how little I could throw out was fun for me , if not exactly sexy . I 'd gotten caught up in the game , back home with my kitchen scale and Lucy 's blue toboggan . I recorded my weights in a little book , I crunched my numbers , and I measured my success by how many days it took to fill a plastic grocery sack . // In the months to come , I 'd find people who neither lived nor worked in the Bay Area who were having fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaun Stenshol , president of Maui Recycling Service , had toyed with the idea of decreeing a Plastic Free Month , but ultimately deemed such a test too easy . Instead , he issued a Zero Waste Challenge . Over the course of four weeks , Maui residents and biodiesel users Bob and Camille Armantrout produced eighty-six pounds of waste , of which all but four ( mostly dairy containers and Styrofoam from a new scanner ) was recyclable . Alarmed to note that 35 percent of their weight was beer bottles , which they recycled , the Armantrouts vowed to improve . Bob ordered beer-making equipment to help reduce the amount of glass they generated , and Camille promised to start making her own yogurt . Despite these efforts , the Armantrouts did n't win the Challenge . The winner of the contest , as so often happens , was its inventor . All on his own , Stenshol had produced an even one hundred pounds of waste , of which he recycled ninety-nine pounds . // Fresh Kills Landfill // Paddling // One of my favorite expeditions while researching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make it into the book , was kayaking around the Fresh Kills landfill , on Staten Island , with Carl Alderson , a coastal restoration specialist who works for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . After a delightful paddle around the dump , Alderson and I narrowly escaped arrest by a sanitation cop only to end up in very shallow water with the tide going out . // ... For several yards we poled and pried , but soon the kayak was stuck for good . Our car was parked a half mile up Main Creek , but the creek had turned into a mere trickle of brown water . Alderson seemed strangely optimistic . He checked the time on his cell phone and started muttering to himself about the tide . " Okay , " he said . " We can wait four hours till it turns , or try again to get upstream , or we can roll over the mud to the edge . " The edge , a field of waving Spartina patens , was about 60 feet away . // " How deep is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // I thought about that . " Have you done it before ? " // " Oh yeah . You 've just got to keep from panicking . It 's like quicksand . " // Alderson was standing in the stern , wind-milling his arms to generate warmth . My feet were ice blocks . " Is that the wind ? " he said , his voice rising , hair fluttering heroically . " It 's pushing the water back in ! " It was the wind , but it was n't delivering any more water . The afternoon was just getting colder and more dismal . At least the snow had stopped . // Opening his cell phone , Alderson dialed the office of the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge , where we 'd picked up the kayak . " Hey , Linda . Could you do me a favor and check today 's tide chart ? " He paused . " Uh-huh , you sure of that ? Okay , thanks . " With a look of resignation , Alderson snapped the phone shut . He had another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refuge greenhouse , maybe we can get Sam and Nate to bring them down and make a path over the mud . " It seemed a little hare-brained to me - we 'd need about fifty pallets - but I liked the idea of involving others . // Alderson slapped the mudflat with his paddle . It quaked . The mud did n't look particularly ominous in the fading light , but I knew it was roiling with life , with the stuff that feeds the marsh 's birds , fish , and mammals . There were marine worms down there , some of them voracious predators more than five inches long , and lugworms and clamworms that ate algae or detritus extracted from the sand . These organisms were tough , able to withstand a half-day of submersion , a half-day of drought , baths of incoming salt water and rinses of sewage- and leachate-tainted fresh . Alderson advised his assistants to avoid touching the mud or water . A woman planting cord grass for him once fell in up to her baseball cap and emerged with a mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " How deep did you say the mud is ? " I asked Alderson for the second time in twenty minutes . // " You ca n't tell , " he said . " It seems bottomless . The silt and organic layering have been going on for millennia . I 've watched a few people go down in chest waders . It 's scary to watch someone sink deeper in muck and further in panic . I 've dragged a few frightened folks out in my day . " // That shut me up . As we waited for Sam and Nate , I thought about how this landscape had changed . In the Paleo-Indian period , between 10,000 BC and 8,000 BC , the western side of Staten Island was a much higher and dryer place . We know that Lenape Indians occupied the area because they left their tools and high middens of clam and oyster shells behind . Sometime between 8,000 and 1,000 BC , rising sea levels created vast swamps on the western side of the island , at which time Lenape settlements became larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hay in these marshes , and it would become Staten Island 's largest cash crop . Just two hundred years ago , before the hydrology of the swamps had been altered , both Richmond and Main Creeks were navigable for more than a mile . Today , the island 's biggest export was garbage . // With a low whine , a golf cart kitted out with a forklift emerged from the dun-colored reeds . While Sam and Nate - vague figures in dark clothes-struggled with the pallets , Alderson lounged like a beer drinker in a lawn chair and offered encouraging suggestions . " Not too far apart , boys . " They grunted . " So did you know we all passed the navigation course ? " // " Yeah , Carl , " said Sam , with no affect . " But when are they teaching the course about tides ? " // Alderson laughed , his eyes crinkling . " I guess that 's next , " he said . // Sam dropped the pallets onto the mud , then went back to the greenhouse for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a burly young man in chest waders , went to the end and strapped on a pair of mud shoes . These resembled snowshoes but were made of webbed rubber that collapses when the foot is lifted and spreads out , like a heron 's foot , when it 's plopped down . With his thick beard and rubber clothing , Nate looked like a vulcanized hero from the underworld . He trudged toward us in a hulking manner . In his hand was a length of frayed rope . If he had a plan , no one knew it . I watched with growing fascination as he drew nearer-slop , slop , slop . Alderson sat still . I sat still . Nate reached the boat , still silent . Now he tied his line to our bow cleat , turned around , and heaved the boat forward and up the sloping mudflat. // " Wow , " I said . Alderson nodded at me and smiled . Barehanded and coatless , Nate hauled on the line again and again . " Should n't we get out ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apparently , there was just enough water in the mud to lubricate our passage . It dawned on me that Alderson and the boys had been through this routine before , in exactly these positions . // ( Continues ... ) //
