Dhanin Chearavanont is n't ashamed to say he wants to retire . Still putting in 14-hour workdays at age 65 , the chairman and CEO of Charoen Pokphand Group ( CP )  --  Thailand 's one truly multinational corporation  --  says he has found time to meditate on the possibilities of voluntary idleness ( he 's worth about $1.3 billion , according to Forbes ) . Maybe he would unmoor his yacht and sail off into the South China Sea . Or maybe he 'd head to his farm and tend to his prized fighting cocks . Maybe . It 's just that things keep cropping up at work , he explains . <P> Things like the aftermath of Asia 's 1997 economic meltdown . Dhanin says just before the Thai baht collapsed , he almost retired . But times were so tough that Dhanin , who had spent decades building a firm that now employs 100,000 people in 20 countries , found himself confronted by a bevy of bankers . HSBC was calling in about $400 million in loans made to CP , and the company did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets to raise money , including stakes in a Chinese motorcycle manufacturer and a brewer  --  companies he believed would thrive as the mainland market developed . " I was prepared to use any means to ensure our survival , ' ' says Dhanin . " It felt bad , but I always believed we 'd get it back tomorrow . " <P> They did . Five years later , Dhanin has reduced CP 's debt and re-established its foothold in China . CP has set up a new brewery and a motorcycle factory and has announced plans to open 100 hypermarkets on the mainland by 2006 . " If we do n't go in now , we will be sidelined , ' ' says Dhanin . Chinese competitors , in particular , " are springing up like mushrooms after a rain . ' ' <P> However , just as Dhanin is building anew , he has been confronted with another potentially damaging setback : avian flu , which has devastated the Thai poultry industry over the past several months . As the No. 1 chicken producer in Asia , CP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors swirled that CP had contributed to the disease 's spread in Thailand by trying to hide the outbreak . CP 's participation in any cover-up " is just not true , ' ' says Dhanin . The company 's chicken farms are a bulwark against the spread of diseases , he contends , because its birds are kept in giant warehouses , sequestered from birds believed to be carriers of the virus . His views are supported by a Bangkok-based senior officer of the U.N . ' s Food and Agriculture Organization , who says enclosed factory farms like CP 's are the safest . <P> Moreover , Dhanin says CP began warning Thai farmers about the possibility of avian flu in November . That 's when company officials showed him a newspaper photo of birds dying in central Thailand . Dhanin says he had no idea it was the deadly H5N1 virus , but he knew he had to act . Orders went out to seal up all of CP 's chicken plants by further restricting access to plant premises  --  even delivery trucks were kept out . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tested positive for avian flu . The next day , CP 's stock plummeted 12.5% . But share prices have since rebounded . And CP says no birds on the factory farms it operates have got sick . Investors expect CP to weather the damage done to its chicken operations , which account for 10% of the group 's revenues .
