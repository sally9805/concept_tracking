AMERICA 'S CATHOLIC BISHOPS have taken on a cause that can win broad public support-fighting to " support marriage , " as Bishop J. Kevin Boland of Savannah put it at the annual fall meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in November . Public debate at the moment is focused on whether homosexual unions should be considered marriage . Bishop Boland said in a press conference , " Marriage is in crisis , and its value will be eroded unless we are willing to point out that same-sex unions are not equivalent to marriage . " // But the crisis of marriage is not so much the impact that gay marriage might have ; it is the destruction of heterosexual marriage by divorce . At the press conference , I asked Bishop Boland : " While you define marriage as a lifelong union between a man and a woman , the fact is there have been 38 million divorces since 1970 affecting almost as many kids . What is your position on reforming no-fault divorce laws , which make it possible for one person unilaterally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into by two people , be exited only with the mutual consent of both people , unless there is a grievous fault such as adultery or physical abuse ? Do you think no-fault divorce laws should be changed to require the mutual consent of husband and wife if there are no major faults involved , especially if children are involved ? " Bishop Boland gamely replied : " We should look into it . We should do everything we can to support stable marriages . Marriage is in a very real crisis situation in our nation . " After the press conference , he added : " I agree there must be change of civil law . The states make it easy to divorce , which is a tragedy , creating conflict for the children and a whole quagmire of fights by the couple over property and custody . " Bishop Boland is right . A child of divorce is 3 times more likely than a child from an intact home to be expelled from school or to conceive a child out of wedlock as a teenager , 6 times as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be incarcerated and 14 times more likely to be physically abused , according to the Heritage Foundation . Furthermore , the greatest impact on children of divorce is not while they are children-but when they became adults . Judith S. Wallerstein tracked 100 children of 60 divorces for 25 years and wrote a landmark book , The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce ( 2000 ) . The unexpected legacy hits when children enter adulthood . Two-thirds are unable to form lasting bonds witb someone of the opposite sex . Of 100 adult children of divorce , only 60 married , of whom 24 have already divorced . This is not a legacy parents , the church or the state should bequeath to innocent children . That is one reason why the Catholic Church has taken a consistent moral position against divorce . Another is the impact of divorce on adults . In his book , The Broken Heart : The Medical Consequences of Loneliness ( 1977 ) , James J. Lynch reveals that divorced men are twice as likely to die in any given year from heart disease , stroke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divorced is four times more likely to occur by auto accidents and suicide ; seven times higher by cirrhosis of the liver and pneumonia . Similarly , divorced women are two to three times as likely to die of cancer as married women . This provides evidence that Jesus was right when he said , " What God has joined together , let man not separate . " Why should two people be bound together if they no longer want to be bonded ? " So often it is just one of the two who is tempted to quit , while the other wants to work at making a success of the marriage , " writes Russell Shaw in Our Sunday Visitor 's Encyclopedia of Catholic Doctrine . Unfortunately , nofault divorce law allows one person to declare in court that the marriage is irreconcilable . If a spouse counters that the marriage is reconcilable , that is no defense ; the judge simply forces the divorce on an unwilling partner . Before the first no-fault divorce provision was adopted in California in 1969 , a partner had to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press for genuine reconciliation or , failing that , to demand alimony as well as child support or possession of the house . The price was high enough that some warring partners reconciled their differences . In other cases , at least a more equitable settlement was possible . Unfortunately , virtually every state now allows no-fault divorce . In her book , Stolen Vows , Judy Parejko writes , " Courts have stolen peoples " ability to make promises to each other . " Three states have passed a modest reform of no-fault divorce : the Covenant Marriage Law first adopted in 1997 by Louisiana under the leadership of then-Representative Tony Perkins , who is currently president of the Family Research Council in Washington , D.C. Couples are given a choice to enter either a standard marriage or a fortified " covenant marriage " in which the couple solemnly declares that " marriage is a covenant between a man and a woman who agree to live together as husband and wife for as long as both may live . We have received premarital counseling on the nature , purposes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act , and we understand that a covenant marriage is for life . If we experience marital difficulties , we commit ourselves to take all reasonable efforts to preserve our marriage , including marital counseling . " In effect , the law permitted couples to waive their rights to no-fault divorce and to choose a marriage license written in permanent ink , not one with disappearing ink . Divorce is possible , but only after counseling and for such serious faults as adultery , abandonment , physical or sexual abuse , habitual intemperance or living apart for two years . Similar laws passed in Arizona and Arkansas . Covenant Marriage Laws held great promise in prompting couples to work harder at saving their marriages for two reasons . First , Catholic leaders of Retrouvaille , a weekend retreat for troubled marriages , report that they can save four out of five deeply troubled marriages . Each weekend is led by Catholic couples whose own marriages had once nearly failed and by a Catholic priest ( see www.retrouvaille.org ) . Second , a study at the University of Chicago by Linda Waite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stick to their vows for five years-report having a happy marriage five years later . But what have been the results of covenant marriage laws ? Only two percent of those marrying in Louisiana have signed up for this more secure marriage . In Arkansas , in 2002 and through May 20 , 2003 , there were 48,979 marriages but only 100 covenant marriages . Why so few ? Clergy marry 86 percent of all couples . Perhaps pastors did not encourage couples to sign up for the Covenant Marriage . Why not ? The population of Louisiana is 53 percent Catholic . Surely Catholic priests know that the Covenant Marriage Law comes closer to traditional Catholic opposition to divorce than the standard marriage , which dissolves as soon as one person is unhappy . Clearly a more substantial reform is needed . Allen M. Parkman , a lawyer and an economist at the University of New Mexico , suggests a major reform in his book , Good Intentions Gone Awry : No-Fault Divorce and the American Family ( 2000 ) . He proposes permitting no-fault divorce early in marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marital failure is lower . But if the conple makes the decision to have children , he would require " mutual consent " for any divorce . Parkman argues that " would encourage spouses to make sacrifices that benefit the marriage , " such as one partner giving up a career to care for children . There would be fewer divorces for trivial reasons . And divorce by mutual consent would be more equitable . A marriage entered into by two people willingly should not end without mutual consent , unless there is grievous fault . If America 's Catholic bishops called for a well-designed reform of no-fault divorce , they could put the issue on the agenda of every state legislature in 2004 . It could become an election year issue on which candidates would have to take a position . Some states would pass the reform that would be a model for other states , what Jesus called a " city on a hill . " At their meeting , the Catholic bishops of the United States took an important first step to revitalize marriage . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reform of heterosexual marriage , which affects millions of families . Most Catholics and Protestants would warmly applaud such an initiative .

He also writes a syndicated newspaper column , Ethics &; Religion . // <p>                     @x " The U.S. tends to be critical of Russia and attempts to define its political practices as nondemocratic . Yet , America itself has been struggling for many years concerning the full meaning of democracy . " <p> " THE RUSSIAN people , " writer Fyodor Mikhaylovich Dostoyevsky once posited , " believe so fervently in an all powerful czar that this ideal is bound to influence the whole future course of our history . " Russia appears to have adopted an imitation of democracy . It is as if a veneer of legitimacy has been put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries , whether under Peter the Great , Vladimir Lenin , or Vladimir Putin . <p> A parliamentary election involving numerous political parties was held in December 2007 , but only Putin 's party ( United Russia ) received glowing television news coverage and various government favors ; it won in a landslide . Dmitri A. Medvedev , Putin 's aide , was endorsed as the presidential candidate , thus ensuring his March 2008 victory . A day after Medvedev was endorsed , he announced that he wanted Putin to be his prime minister , allowing Putin to keep substantial power even though he gave up the presidency . Why did Putin go through the motions of a legitimate election ? He easily could have persuaded the electorate to extend his term as president . In fact , new legislation " allows for the extension of the presidential term . Apparently , Putin wants to be seen on the world stage not simply as a dictator , but as a lawful and popular representative of the Russian people . <p> Russia under Putin certainly has shown no great hunger for Western-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all opposition . However . a diversity of voices flourish in newspapers , where criticism of the Prime Minister is not uncommon . Similar criticism is found on the Internet . Mikhail Khordorkovsky , an arch foe of Putin -- who is serving a jail sentence for fraud -- writes from his prison cell that " Putin certainly is no liberal and no democrat , but nonetheless , he is more liberal and democratic than 70% of the population of oar country . " After the turmoil of the post-Communist years , Russians want a strong leader . They crave stability , consumer goods , and travel -- things that were denied them previously . Political structures in Russia still are developing . The rule of law is shaky and those in power are not accountable . The government is shaped by the leaders ' instincts about what the people expect and will bear . The result is that an increasingly authoritarian Russia is less likely to work in concert with the West . <p> Putin 's goal is to make post-Soviet Russia a modern country . He is brutally honest in public about how backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goals . He believes gross national product should be doubled in 10 years . This will provide the financial underpinning to make the nation with the word 's largest land mass look more like a European country . Putin intends to tidy up what he considers the disorder of the democratic experiment . This includes smashing the oligarchs , as be does not want competing centers of power , he has no desire to see rich people outside of government challenge him by supporting other political parties and opposition candidates . He does not like the idea of a parliament that actually can block what he wants to do or a media that can investigate what he does and hold his people to account- He desires order without a lot of accountability or pluralism . <p> Boris Nemtsov. one of Boris Yeltsin 's ex-ministers , and others , confirm that Russia 's economic boom gave Putin the cash and support he needed to stamp his authority on the country : " We have $100,000,000,000 in the stabilization hind , $300,000,000,000 in the central bank , and one great person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money among the people . ... Do you think such ... a system needs democracy ? No " Putin is like millions of Russians who wax nostalgic for the crazy , bankrupt , and corrupted Soviet Union . These individuals do not like freedom and democracy -- and do not even understand the meaning of it . <p> The present state of democracy in Russia raises a couple of questions : can a modern state be built without liberty or based on a government of specialists with extremely limited involvement of the people ? Can the government role with contained feedback from society ? <p> Putin became president and principal leader of Russia almost by accident . He was fortunate in developing an association with Yeltsin -- Russia 's first popularly elected president -- at a strategically opportune time . Putin possessed the skills needed to carry out the goals of scrapping communism and its command economy -- notwithstanding the blunders and burdens placed upon him by a sick and , at times , bungling Yeltsin . <p> With the Russian Revolution of 1991 Mikhail Gorbachev -- the last General Secretary of the Communist party -- was replaced and Yeltsin assumed power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeltsin had the courage and personality to take control and to abolish Soviet and Communist structures , but lacked the capability of carrying out needed reforms . State property was sold to opportunistic entrepreneurs for a fraction of its value . Because it brought chaos to the marketplace , democracy did not work . Corruption and bribery were rife . <p> In 2000 , Yeltsin installed his prime minister ( Putin ) as his successor . Putin is sober , wiry , acerbic , and always appears to be in control -- and people are aware that he saved Russia from the ravages of the Yeltsin reign . Yeltsin had the image of a bombastic backslapper who rarely was inclined to say no to a drink and who let things get out of hand . Some of Yeltsin 's admirers say Putin has turned his back on the pluralistic democracy that Yeltsin was seeking to build , but Putin 's backers retort that the Yeltsin years sowed instability and a strong hand in the Kremlin was needed to steady the country . <p> Putin became quite popular and , in turn , installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Putin in St. Petersburg . Medvedev was trained as a lawyer and has a Ph.D . When Putin took office as president , there were many empty shelves in supermarkets , political blood feuds , and bank collapses . He has given Russians a sense of stability in contrast to the national shame and chaos left by Yeltsin , Russia once again is a powerful nation , free from debt , rich in oil , and not beholden to the international community . <p> L : Black gold Thanks to the worldwide oil boom , pensions have been increased and highly visible swipes have been taken by the government against corruption . Yeltsin was elected president of Russia under a constitution that protected human rights and property while providing for a separation of powers . In 1992 , Yeltsin made a power grab , leading to a military standoff . He was successful in gaining passage of a new constitution that disproportionately shifted power to the executive branch , at the expense of parliament . In 1996 , though not overly popular , Yeltsin won reelection , thanks to financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier had acquired large and profitable companies from the store . At the same time , Yeltsin 's health was poor , but the press -- at least at first -- suppressed news of his heart attacks . While Putin did not ask for the job of running Russia , he soon warmed to the task and decided that the country needed an overhaul . <p> Gorbachev and Yeltsin wanted to bring about their own perceived version of modernity . Gorbachev knew that Russia was falling well behind other countries and sought to correct the command economy and its socialist underpinnings . Gorbachev mistakenly thought that he could change socialism and the form of democracy it represented to permit Russia to catch up with the West . Yeltsin , on the other hand , did not believe the problem could be solved by tinkering with the mechanism providing the goods and services . He rightly understood that the entire machine had to be scrapped . He had the guts and the farsightedness to start this process once Gorbachev left office , but lacked the skill and good health to carry out all the changes required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process forward . He has accomplished a great deal , but all of his moves have not been toward Western-style democracy . Putin 's goal is to transform Russia into a modern country , but what does it mean to be a modern country ? Must it mean that the country totally is democratic and , if it does , what does it mean to be democratic ? <p> The U.S. tends to be critical of Russia and attempts to define its political practices as non-democratic . Yet , America itself has been struggling for many years concerning the full meaning of democracy . Remember , too , that our nation is not a true democracy , but a representative republic . There is a difference . It was not until World War I that women were allowed to vote in the U.S. <p> There are many forms of democracy throughout the world . Great Britain , for instance , has no supreme court , congress , or a separate executive branch , yet we call it a democracy . Countries may claim to be democracies , but may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal tradition , citizens should rest assured that their personal rights will be observed . This means not getting arrested without proper warrants based on evidence , as well as being entitled to a fair trial at which they have adequate and competent representation -- and further that they can be convicted based only on proper evidence , and that their property will not be taken without due process . A democratic society is one in which there is freedom to speak and write , and means of communication are available equally to government and citizens to permit them to get their message out without penalty . Many leaders and rulers , including Putin , would like to have the unfettered freedom to role without being called to account by the electorate . However , if corruption is to be avoided , the corrupt must be subject to the bright light of inquiry , such as we see on our television sets and in our newspapers on a daily basis . <p> Putin was born in 1952 . His father served in the Soviet navy and was assigned to the submarine fleet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joseph Stalin , both former heads of the USSR . His father was a militant atheist , but his mother was an orthodox Christian who attended church regularly and who had her son christened secretly when he was a baby . Putin is shown regularly on television attending Orthodox services . He graduated in 1975 from the law school at the University of St. Petersburg and , thereafter , obtained a doctorate in economics . Putin is fluent in German . He has taken English lessons and has spoken directly to former Pres. George W. Bush at a number of their meetings . For formal talks , he speaks through an interpreter . <p> Following his schooling , he was recruited by the KGB ( Knowledge Generation Bureau ) and joined the Communist party . In the KGB , he was assigned to combat political dissent and ferret out foreign intelligence . He earned the rank of lieutenant colonel and completed a tour of duty in Dresden , East Germany . Upon his return , Putin was hired by Anatoli Sobchak , mayor of St. Petersburg , to head the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Medvedev . In 1996 , Yeltsin transferred Putin to Moscow . He had developed a reputation as intelligent , tough , and hard working . In 1998 , Yeltsin made him head of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , successor to the KGB . In 1999 , Putin was appointed Yeltsin 's prime minister . He became acting president when Yeltsin resigned his post . <p> Putin moved quickly to reestablish the authority of the central government over the Russian republics and administrative units . He also increased control over the independent media . He pushed economic reforms through parliament and renewed ties with former Soviet client states . He reinstated opposition to U.S. ballistic missile defenses . His first Decree , signed Dec. 31 , 1999 , guaranteed that corruption charges against Yeltsin and his family would not be pursued . He was reelected president in March 2004 . <p> L : Aggression against America Under Putin , Russia has taken a much more aggressive stance against the U.S. , noticeable particularly in a February 2007 anti-American tirade in Munich , criticizing what he called the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he maintains , projects an " almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations . ... No one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them . Of course , such a policy stimulates an arms race . " He called for a " fair and democratic world order that would ensure security and prosperity not only for a select few , but for all . " <p> According to Putin , the Georgian war in North Caucasus -- for which he endured widespread criticism outside of Russia -- is over . On another front , he asserts that Chechnya has a full-fledged democracy . Russia 's levels of social and economic development have been rising . For the most part , citizens can exercise their fights and courts enjoy a large measure of independence . Total investment in the Russian economy has increased sevenfold . Real incomes are two-and-a-half times what they were in 2000 and there has been a 70% rise in the country 's gross domestic product during Putin 's tenure ( albeit because of the high price of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable and effective political system . <p> Nemtsov -- a Kremlin insider -- maintains that the excess revenue should have been used to carry out much needed reforms in health care , education , transportation , the pension system , and defense . However , Nemtsov charges , as under Leonid Brezhnev ( former General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) , this extra income largely has been frittered away . Nemtsov also complains that there is unprecedented corruption draining off available surpluses . He assets that assets are being removed from state ownership and handed over to the control of private individuals , and property is being repurchased with state money from the oligarchs at stunning prices . A " friends of Putin " oil export monopoly is being created and a Kremlin " black safe " ( slush fund ) is being financed . <p> Nemtsov further claims that there has been a decline in the rule of law and respect for human rights . With the exception of the lower courts , the country 's judges are entirely subordinate to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement agencies and courts use the law to advance the financial interests of powerful political clans . As in the case with Mikhail Khodorkovsky , former owner of Yukos , tax terrorism is used by the government to take over ownership of property from private owners and redistribute it to Kremlin insiders . <p> Because of controls the government has on the media , it will be difficult for opponents to get their message out to bring about changes hi the law . The Kremlin runs virtually all mass media , particularly national television . As liar the print media , there are three truly independent daily newspapers : Novaya Gazeta , Kommersant , and Vedomosti . Even combined , they have a very limited circulation . With respect to radio stations , Ekho Moskvy is provocative , but others stick to the Kremlin line . The Internet is not yet censored , but less than 20% of adult Russians regularly go online . Because of the difficulties for communication by Russian liberals , they have reverted to protests and street demonstrations . <p> Nemtsov believes that change will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible contract with the people by which they tolerate corruption , mismanagement , crime , and constraints on the mass media so long as they have buying power and continue to live better than they did in the Yeltsin era . However , if the economy falters , that invisible contract could be broken , and the rulers brought to account . <p> With a change of administration in Washington , Putin and Medvedev have another opportunity to test their ideas for achieving respect and harmony , and to take their place with Pres. Barack Obama and his chief associates as they attempt to transform Russia into a progressive nation . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Russian Pres. Dmitri A.
