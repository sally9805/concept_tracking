Chapter One I WAS EXPECTING ONE KIND of trouble when another came knocking at my door . A year or so after I opened my Florence Avenue Used Book Shop , I installed four mirrors ; one in the upper-right-hand corner of the door frame , one just outside the lower-left-hand side of the window , and the third , and second-largest , mirror was placed inside the window . So by daylight or lamplight at night , all I had to do was pull back the bottom hem of the inside drape to see who was knocking . I installed my little spying device because if a man wanted to kill you and you asked " Who is it ? " on the other side of a thin plank of wood , all he would have to do is open fire and that would be it . You might as well just throw the door open and say " Here I am . Come shoot me . " Someone might wonder why the owner of a used-book store would even think about armed assassins coming after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is America we 're talking about . And not only America but Los Angeles in the midfifties-1956 to be exact . We are n't talking about the Wild West or a period of social and political unrest . That was the most serene period of a democratic and peaceful nation . Most Americans at that time only worried about the cost of gas going above twenty-ninecents a gallon . But most Americans were n't black and they sure did n't live in South Central L.A. And even if they were my color and they did live in my neighborhood , their lives would have been different . Through no fault of my own I often found myself in the company of desperate and dangerous men-and women . I associated with murderers , kidnappers , extortionists , and fools of all colors , ages , and temperaments . By nature I am a peaceful man , some might say cowardly . I do n't care what they say . It does not shame me to admit that I would rather run than fight . Sometimes , even with my mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knock was too loud or too stealthy . And during business hours , from 10:00 a.m. to 3:45 p.m . Monday through Saturday , I sat at my desk at the top of the staircase so that if someone dangerous walked in I would be able to get away before they even knew I was there ; the fourth , and largest , mirror was on the ceiling at the head of the stairs for just that purpose . Do n't get me wrong ; most of my customers were readers , primarily women and children , and unlikely to be looking for trouble . Whole days could go by and no one came to my bookstore ( which was also my home ) , so I could spend long days reading books , uninterrupted and blissful . But even though I was alone most days and the people who sought me out were , 999 times out of 1,000 , looking for a book , there was that one time now and again when someone came to my door bearing malice and a gun . I often think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones . Fearless was tall and thin , jet of color , and stronger of thew and character than any other man I had ever met . He was n't afraid of death or love , threat or imprisonment . Fearless Jones was n't even afraid of poverty , which made him a rare man indeed . No one could intimidate him and so he went wherever he wanted and associated with anyone he cared to . Those anyones often came to me when they were looking for my friend and expressed themselves in ways that Fearless would not have stood for-if he were there . Sometimes Fearless came to me when he was in a jam and needed the clear eye of logic to see his way out . And , because he 'd saved my life more than once , I most often agreed to help , with the caveat that my aid would n't throw me into trouble . The problem was , Fearless did n't ever feel like he was in trouble . " Do n't worry , " he 'd tell me . " It ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting at us , and Fearless did some impossible maneuver , and the gunman was disarmed , and Fearless was there smiling , saying , " You see ? I told you it was all right . " So when I heard that knock on my door at 3:51 in the afternoon , I moved the hem of the drape expecting one thing , but instead I saw Ulysses S. Grant IV staring up into the mirror and waving . " Open up , Paris . It 's me . " I was a fool . I knew it even then . So what if Useless saw me in my mirror ? I did n't have to open the door . I could have walked upstairs , opened up a copy of Don Quixote that I 'd just acquired , and read to my heart 's content . " Come on , Cousin , " Useless said . " I know you there . " I should have walked away , but Useless worried me . The kind of trouble he brought was like an infection . He never had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're already in a mess . Now how do you plan to get out ? " I opened the door and stood to bar his entrance . " What do you want ? " I asked him . " Let me by , Cousin , " he said with a grin . " I need some ice water . " " I 'm not askin ' you again , Useless . " We were the same height , which is to say short , and he was fairly light colored , where I am considered dark ( that is unless you see me standing next to Fearless Jones ) . Ulysses S. Grant IV , whom everyone but his mother and Fearless called Useless , was a petty thief , a liar , a malingerer , and just plain bad luck . His mother and mine were half-sisters , and I 'd been dragged off by the ear because of him as far back as I could remember . As young as nine years old I was avoiding Useless . The last time we 'd seen each other was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of ice water and use of the toilet . After he 'd gone I did n't think much of it . But that night , while I was sleeping , I began to worry . Why had he been there ? Who drops by somebody 's place in L.A. for a glass of water ? It was three o'clock in the morning , but I pulled myself out of bed and went into my bathroom . I searched the medicine cabinet and behind the commode and in between the bath towels stacked on a shelf . Nothing . I made coffee in my hot-plate kitchen and then went back to lift the heavy porcelain lid off the tank of the toilet . Down in the tank was a waterproof rubber sack filled with gold chains of various lengths and designs . Solid gold . The whole thing must have weighed two pounds . That was 4:00 a.m . Fearless was at my place in less than half an hour and he took the swag to hide it elsewhere . I was in bed again by five . At 6:47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went right to the toilet . Somehow they managed to shatter the lid . It was late morning before they stopped turning over my bookstore . Those cops flipped through more books in that one day than most librarians do in a year . After all that they arrested me . Milo Sweet , the bail bondsman , got me a good lawyer who told the cops that they had nothing on me and that any accusations made against me had to be proven or at least strongly indicated . A week later an ugly guy named Jos Favor came by my house . " Where the gold , mothahfuckah ? " he said to me right off . One of his nostrils was wider than its brother , and the knuckles of his fists were misshapen , probably from beating on smaller men like me . " You will have to speak to my agent , " I told the man , who had already grabbed me by the collar of my shirt . " Say what ? " " Fearless Jones , " I said , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ugly black man with the round eyes asked . " He told me that anyone wan na know anything about gold they should come and see him . " Jos did n't say any more . I never heard about the gold again . Fearless came by the next week and took me to Tijuana , where we drank tequila and met some very nice young ladies who taught us Spanish and made us breakfast four mornings in a row . I had n't seen Useless since then and I had n't missed him for a second . " I 'M IN TROUBLE , PARIS , " Ulysses said , looking pathetic . " So ? " " I need help . " " I sell books , not help . " " It 's about that time with the gold chains , right ? " he asked me . I did n't even answer . " That was n't my fault , Paris . The cops got a hold'a me and like to beat me half to death . I told ' em that I hid ' em in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know nuthin ' about it . " I could have asked him why did they arrest me , then ? But that would have opened a conversation , and I did n't want to have anything to do with Useless Grant . " I need a place to hide out , " he said . " Not here . " " We blood , Paris . " " That might be , but I ai n't bleedin ' for you . " I thought Useless was going to break down and cry . But then he looked at my face and saw that I would n't let him in if he was having a heart attack . He was n't getting across my threshold even if he fell down dead . " Well , do me one favor , okay ? " he said . I just stared at him . " Tell Three Hearts that there 's a man named Hector wrote my name on a black slip'a paper . Tell her that I tried to make it work with Angel , but I guess I was mudfoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing . Nothing . Useless was less than that to me . I heard his words and I would repeat them if I ever saw his mother again , but he was n't going to make it into my house . No sir , not in a thousand years . ( Continues ... )
