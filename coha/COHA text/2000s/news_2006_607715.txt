<p> Dan Grunfeld tried other sports as a kid , he really did . He even went out for the soccer team as a sixth-grader . That experiment lasted one day . <p> " When the ball came to me , I caught it like I was going to shoot a jumper , " Grunfeld said . " I do n't quit things , but I stopped playing soccer . I only made it through one practice and was like : ' This is not for me . ' " <p> Baseball ? " They did n't call me Babe Ruth , put it that way , " Grunfeld said . " Basketball was my thing . " <p> Grunfeld , who recently graduated from Stanford and participated at the NBA pre-draft camp in Orlando last week , is the son of Washington Wizards President of Basketball Operations Ernie Grunfeld , so it should come as no surprise that he has always been drawn to hoops . <p> Ernie Grunfeld was a college star at Tennessee , where he once made the cover of Sports Illustrated with teammate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine-season NBA career that concluded in 1986 with the New York Knicks , and he is running his third NBA team after previous front-office stops with the Knicks and Milwaukee Bucks . Dan Grunfeld has been immersed in the game from the day he was born in 1984 . <p> Grunfeld and his wife , Nancy , never pushed their son into basketball . They did n't have to . " He was always around it , " said Grunfeld , who watched Dan play in Orlando last week along with representatives of every other NBA team . " He was at practices , he was around the locker room , he was at big playoff games . So basketball just came natural to him . He loves the game and he 's worked hard to get where he is . " <p> That would be on the verge of making an NBA roster . <p> Dan , a 6-foot-6 , 220-pound shooting guard-small forward , averaged 12 points and 4.8 rebounds as a senior but was slowed because he was recovering from surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior season . At the time of the injury , Grunfeld was averaging 17.9 points on 50 percent shooting and was projected as a potential first-round draft pick . <p> A crafty player with an excellent shooting touch and solid defensive skills , Grunfeld wore a bulky knee brace that limited his mobility and explosion as a senior . He has steadily worked to get back to where he was before the injury . <p> As a junior , Grunfeld scored 20 or more points in eight games and gained national attention after scoring 29 points on 10-for-12 shooting in a victory over Arizona . That and summertime pick-up games with NBA stars such as Sam Cassell , Ray Allen and Gilbert Arenas convinced Grunfeld that he had a realistic shot at a professional career . <p> The knee injury has been a setback , though . Grunfeld played without the brace for the first time last week and showed no signs of favoring the knee . <p> " I feel like I 'm getting back to where I was before I got hurt , " said Grunfeld , who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming back and I 'm not thinking about the knee as much , I 'm just playing my game . It takes time . People always say that that first year is the toughest part . I rehabbed very hard and it 's feeling great . " <p> Grunfeld had his moments in Orlando but struggled to fit into the disjointed , often sloppy style that is prevalent in such camps . He shot 31.8 percent from the field while averaging 6.6 points in three games . <p> " This is not an ideal setting for a player like him , " said one Western Conference scout who saw Grunfeld play at Stanford . " At Stanford , he excelled in a system , cutting , moving without the ball , screening and playing off other players . Here , it 's a lot of one-on-one . Guys , especially the guards , are looking for their own shot every time down the floor . Danny needs to be in a situation where he can use his skills as an all-around player . The important thing is that his knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see . You know he has good basketball instincts and you know that he can shoot the ball . " <p> If he goes undrafted , Grunfeld will likely catch on with some team 's summer league squad and then try to work his way onto a roster as an undrafted free agent . Guard Donell Taylor , who was undrafted out of the University of Alabama-Birmingham last June , used a strong summer league performance to catch on with the Wizards in the fall . <p> Grunfeld has worked out individually for three teams  --  Golden State , Milwaukee and the Knicks  --  and he has more workouts planned prior to the June 28 draft . One team Grunfeld wo n't visit is the Wizards . <p> " I asked him if he wanted to come in for a workout , " Ernie said . " He said : ' Why would I work out for you ? I live with you . ' " <p> Ernie is clearly proud of his son 's basketball talents but says he is most proud of the fact that Dan was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from what could have been an emotionally crushing knee injury . <p> " He never complained and he never felt sorry for himself , " Ernie said . " He just put in the work to come back and he 's recovered very well . " <p> Several front-office types and coaches who played with or against Ernie remarked on the uncanny resemblance between father and son during last week 's pre-draft camp . <p> Watching Dan Grunfeld play while standing only a few feet away from his father , Boston Celtics Coach Doc Rivers remarked : " He looks exactly like the old man . " <p> Dan has dealt with comparisons to his father his entire life and appears to be comfortable with everything that comes along with carrying his last name . However , Dan did his best to simply blend in at Orlando . <p> When a photographer prepared to take a photo of father and son , Dan was anxious to stay out of sight of other players and get the shot over with as quickly as possible . <p> " I just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan explained . <p> Milwaukee-Wisconsin forward Josh Tucker , who was a teammate of Dan 's at Nicolet High School in Milwaukee , also worked out in Orlando and said : " What do you mean ? You 've always been that kid . You should be used to it . " <p> Still , Dan said he 's never felt any added pressure to live up to expectations . <p> " I try not to get caught up in that , " he said . " My parents never pressured me to play basketball . My dad never pressured me to play . It was something I liked to do from an early age and that 's what I did . My parents just support me like any other parents . Growing up with Grunfeld on the back of my jersey probably made some people look closer and scrutinize a few things a little closer but I never got caught up in that . I just love to play basketball . " <p> However , Dan said he would prefer to pursue his professional dreams someplace other than Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , my dad sees enough of me , " Dan said . " He 's probably sick of me . Besides , he 'd end up trading me or something , and my mom would trade him . " <p> Wizards Note : The Wizards worked out three draft propects yesterday at Verizon Center . The group included guard Tony Skinn ( George Mason ) , guard Carl Elliott ( George Washington ) and forward Akin Akingbala ( Clemson ) . <p> Elliott , a junior last season , is an early-entry candidate and can withdraw his name and return to George Washington for his senior season as long as he does not hire an agent . The withdrawal deadline for underclassmen is Sunday . The Wizards hold the 18th and 48th selections in the June 28 draft .
