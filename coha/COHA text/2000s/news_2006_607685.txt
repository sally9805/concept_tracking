<p> He was always too headstrong for his own good . Like the time at Boston College when Matt Hasselbeck learned he would not be the starting quarterback . This discovery filled him with a rage that sent him storming into the office of the coach , Dan Henning . <p> " You should wear big red shoes and a big red nose because you are a clown ! " he said he shouted . <p> Perhaps not the kind of thing a college junior should be saying to the man who holds his future in his hands . But this was always the way of Hasselbeck , with his cherubic smile and unfailing politeness . Underneath bubbled a fury and that fury would come bursting out in the most peculiar ways . <p> The coin twirled in the frigid air of his first playoff game two years ago . The Seahawks were going into overtime in Green Bay , a whole country was watching , Seattle won the toss . What to do ? The official looked at Hasselbeck and the quarterback lifted his head , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're going to score ! " <p> They did n't . And when he threw a pass into the hands of a Packers cornerback named Al Harris , who ran 52 yards across the turf for the winning touchdown , there was much laughter at the expense of Hasselbeck . Just who did this guy think he was ? <p> But there was something in the brazenness that made the same men put in charge of him smile . Henning , the clown , absorbed the verbal assault , then said , " I 'm proud of you Matthew , " and soon gave Hasselbeck his starting job . Mike Holmgren , the Seahawks coach who disdains any public displays of cockiness , instead doubled his faith in his quarterback , quietly believing even more that this was the person who could someday take him back to the Super Bowl . <p> And so here they are , two wins away from that dream , with the best football season Seattle has ever seen . And it is Hasselbeck who has become the Seahawks ' unquestioned leader , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be the most potent offense in the NFL . <p> Even if the process tried every bit of patience that coach and quarterback possessed . <p> This thought made Holmgren smile a bit as he stood in the team 's empty practice bubble after a workout this week . There were so many times he screamed at his young passer , stared him down and looked as if he wanted to break him in two . At last , it seems , they had finally gotten past those days . <p> " One of the things that has always been attractive to me is his competitive spirit , " Holmgren said . " If he wants answers to questions and he asks questions , then it is my obligation to give him the answers . The problem with players on occasion is they do n't like the answers . Or they think they have the answers until every once in a while they get hit in the mouth and then they come and say , ' Okay , maybe you are right . ' <p> " This is kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players . But this is one of the reasons they are good . Then all of a sudden you go through those bumps and you get to a point where you trust one another . Then all sorts of good stuff happens . " <p> It has come to the point where Hasselbeck , along with Shaun Alexander , is the most vital of all the Seahawks players , the one the team can least afford to lose . If he goes , they will lose their head , the one who makes them move . And this was n't always the case . <p> " I think sometimes as a player you think you understand what the coach is looking for and you 're wrong , " Hasselbeck said . " A coach starts to coach you or starts to explain something to you and it 's very easy for me  --  I 'm not a good listener  --  to say , ' Yeah , yeah I got it , ' but you do n't really ' got it . ' You 're missing the point exactly . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Hasselbeck was an unwanted graduate of Boston College , looking for work in an NFL that thought so little of him it did n't even invite him to its pre-draft combine . Holmgren , then coaching the Packers , took a chance and stuck Hasselbeck in a locker next to Brett Favre , perhaps the most rambunctious and bull-headed of all of Holmgren 's quarterback proteges . <p> Too much of Favre rubbed off on the kid who was determined to make a whole league pay for not paying attention , to make the super agents kick themselves for not signing him , for leaving him in the Boston snow to run the icy steps of the team stadium telling himself he was Rocky Balboa . <p> Soon , the Packers ' backup was scrambling across the field , throwing off one foot , figuring he , too , could fire a football between three defensive backs . This was fine to the coaches in Green Bay because being Favre 's backup in those days meant you would n't see the field in a real game . But then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle , traded for Hasselbeck . And before the quarterback had even pulled on a cap for his introductory interview , he was anointed the starting quarterback . <p> Which was funny because the only action photo one newspaper could produce to run with the story about Seattle 's new quarterback was a snapshot of Hasselbeck holding the ball on an extra point , since throwing a pass was something he had only done 29 times to that point . <p> Still , the disciple of Favre would not be deterred . He burst into the Seahawks ' headquarters determined to show everyone just how much he already knew . He met the new quarterbacks coach , Jim Zorn  --  a man still unfamiliar with Holmgren 's West Coast offense  --  and began drawing the team 's plays all over the chalkboards . <p> Zorn smiled politely , then set about to work on more important things like footwork and throwing and beating the Favre out of a quarterback who was not Favre . <p> It was a hard fight . Hasselbeck , so eager , was pounded early . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demotion . By the middle of 2002 , it appeared the scouts who thought so little of Hasselbeck were right . Then Dilfer went down with a torn Achilles ' . Given a second chance , Hasselbeck thrived . His breakthrough came the last game that season , when he threw for 449 yards in a game Seattle won in overtime against the Chargers . The tying score came at the end of regulation when he shook off two tackles and plunged headfirst into the end zone . <p> He kept his shoes from that day as a reminder of what he could become . Holmgren was so touched that two days later , he agreed to stay and coach Hasselbeck even as management was stripping him of his general manager title , all but inviting the coach to walk away . But Holmgren had staked his future on the promise of Hasselbeck . If they were going to go down , they would go down together . <p> " I never lost faith in him , " Holmgren said . " I think I did a little bit of disservice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to do the whole thing again I would probably do it the same way . I just maybe would call the game a little different . I would protect him a little bit more if I could to stay healthy . " <p> Then Holmgren paused and said , " To Matt 's credit , after sitting down and then coming back , I think he learned a lot . " <p> On the eve of the most important game in his career so far Hasselbeck smiled . He said the person who got him through the bleakest times when he lost his job was Dilfer , just as it was he who helped get Dilfer through the death of his son . It is Dilfer who he says showed him how to deal with the embarrassment of losing a job . He watched his replacement and he learned . <p> " I think when I did a better job of being a little more humble and really being a better listener and being more coachable , I think that made the relationship with Holmgren better , " Hasselbeck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a gap at the top of the NFC for the next great quarterback . More and more , it is the last one anyone expected , the one who used to sit in the locker just next door .
