<p> You think the Apple iPhone is easy to use ? Consider the apple . No buttons , dials or plugs , just a stem , peel and some seeds . Its insides are not full of mysterious circuits , just flesh as crisp as the fall air . Its batteries wo n't die ; <p> rather , it will recharge yours . Price ? No comparison : Even with the recent drop , at $400 , the iPhone costs 1,600 times as much as a Red Delicious ( 25 cents ) . <p> The Colorado crop - of apples , not electronic devices - might be a little down this year because of a freeze this spring , but the 15 million pounds of locally grown apples that will make it to our tables should be in good shape , says Harold Larsen of the Western Colorado Research Center . <p> He 's looking forward to biting into a Western Slope Cripps Pink Lady , a late-maturing sweet-tart , almost fizzy fruit that will appear here in November . Also perfect for eating out-of-hand : Cameo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of year , we want them in pies , cakes and sauces , even with roasts and risottos . <p> For pies , look for apples that hold their shape when cooked : Cameo , Jonagold and good ol ' Granny Smith . Some people combine " saucy " apples like McIntosh with baking apples to create a moist filling . <p> Gala , Red and Golden Delicious are tied for the state 's No. 1 crop , but Reds will soon fall behind as growers switch to pricier and tastier Galas to meet consumer demand . " The Red Delicious was bred to the point where it 's a beautiful red piece of cardboard , " says Larsen . " When they bred for color , they lost the flavor . People are willing to pay more for Galas . " <p> Like the iPhone . <p> Lieutenant Dan ( of " Forrest Gump " fame ) knew what he was talking about when he gave Tom Hanks 's character investment advice : " Lieutenant Dan got me invested in some kind of fruit company . " <p> Many Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtook apples in 2002 as the state 's largest fruit crop , now at 2,200 acres , with a value in 2006 of $17 million . In 2006 , about 1,400 acres of apple orchards yielded just $5 million . And grapes are threatening to overtake apples , says Larsen . <p> The good news is that Honey-crisps and organics are potential growth areas here , Larsen says . <p> To find Colorado-grown apples , shop at farmers markets or look for the Colorado Proud label at your grocery store . <p> Kristen Browning-Blas : 303-954-1440 or <p> kbrowning@denverpost.com <p> Apple Spice Cake <p> One of the nicest characteristics of this dense cake from " The New Basics Cookbook , " by Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins , is that it 's strong enough to stand up to a scoop of ice cream but not so sweet that you feel guilty sneaking a slice with your morning coffee . We made this cake using tiny sweet-tart Akane apples from Palisade . Makes 12 portions . <p> Ingredients <p> 2 1/4 cups unbleached <p> all-purpose flour <p> 2 1/2 teaspoons baking <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground cloves <p> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger <p> Pinch of salt <p> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda <p> 3 cups finely diced peeled tart apples <p> 1/3 cup raisins <p> 1/3 cup chopped walnuts <p> 1 1/2 cups packed dark <p> brown sugar <p> 12 tablespoons ( 1 1/2 sticks ) unsalted butter at room <p> temperature <p> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract <p> 3 large eggs <p> 1/2 cup buttermilk <p> 1/2 cup applesauce <p> Syrup <p> 1/3 cup Calvados or applejack <p> 2 tablespoons granulated sugar <p> 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice <p> 6 strips lemon zest ( each 3-by- 1/2 inches ) <p> Directions <p> Preheat oven to 350 degrees . Butter and flour a 9-inch tube pan or a 12- cup bundt pan . <p> Using a fork , stir the flour , baking powder , spices and baking soda together in a bowl . <p> Combine apples , raisins and walnuts in another bowl . Add 3 tablespoons of the flour mixture and toss to coat . Set aside <p> Combine brown sugar , butter and vanilla in a mixing bowl and cream until the mixture is light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Stir in buttermilk and applesauce . <p> Slowly add flour mixture to butter mixture , beating just until blended . Stir in fruits and nuts . Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth top . <p> Bake until a toothpick inserted in cake comes out clean , at least one hour . Let the cake cool , still in the pan , for 1 hour . <p> Prepare syrup by combining all ingredients in a small saucepan and heat just to a simmer . When sugar has dissolved , remove pan from the heat and set it aside for 15 minutes . <p> Unmold cake and place it on a serving platter . Prick the cake all over with a wooden skewer . Remove the lemon zest from the syrup and brush the top and sides of the cake with the syrup until it has all been absorbed . <p> Note : If you do n't have apple-flavored hooch around the house and do n't feel like investing , you can make a similar syrup by substituting apple juice for the Calvados or applejack . <p> WINE IDEAS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with Calvados if you want an apple spirit . But if you want to stick with something American , pour a snifter of bourbon . The sweet caramel flavor and warm alcohol burn makes a delicious companion to the cake . Maker 's Mark is an excellent standby ; search out Evan Williams Single Barrel or Black Maple Hill , too . Tara Q.
