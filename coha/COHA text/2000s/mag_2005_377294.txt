What 's a marketer to do if a much awaited product is n't quite ready to be shown off ? Send customers to a " virtual showroom " instead , via their cell phones . That 's what BMW did last month at the auto shows in Los Angeles and Detroit . With its redesigned 3-series sedan not yet ready for prime time ( the vehicle is scheduled to hit U.S. showrooms in early summer ) , the German automaker handed out cards imprinted with a phone number .
