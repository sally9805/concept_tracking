<p> On St. Patrick 's Day , the phrase " holy day of obligation " is usually not the first thing to pass o'er the lips of the saint 's many celebrants . <p> More than 1,500 years after St. Patrick 's death , this almost-international holiday has morphed into a celebration of all things Irish . <p> Worldwide , millions of people will partake of the numerous parades and festivals that make everyone feel a little bit Irish . And merchants and bartenders are at the ready  --  eager to divest the green from well-stewed customers . <p> When the final , weepy chorus of " Danny Boy " has concluded , tavern floors , sticky with spilled beer , will be littered with crushed green bowlers and tattered shamrocks . <p> But for the daughters and sons of Erin , scattered the world over , St. Patrick 's Day evokes a living heritage that transcends the cliche of shamrocks and shillelaghs , banshees and bog-trotters , and magic little green men attired in waistcoats . <p> Best-selling Irish essayist and novelist Nuala O'Faolain , in San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact that St. Patrick 's Day is more enthusiastically celebrated here than in her homeland . And San Francisco native Frank Jordan Jr. , son of the former mayor and a second-generation Irish American , has tried to bridge the culture gap between the Irish and their American descendants through his band , which plays traditional Irish music . <p> Come Tuesday morning , Jordan and his fellow band members in Culann 's Hounds will have played traditional Irish music for three days straight . <p> The band is named for Cuchulainn , the heroic Ulster warrior of Irish folklore . <p> But O'Faolain remembers more somber  --  and sober  --  celebrations of Ireland 's patron saint . <p> " The only place you could get a drink was at the annual dog show , " recalls O'Faolain , chuckling . " Thousands of people would head for the old Royal Dublin Showground out in Ballsbridge . " <p> That 's because , until the late ' 70s , all the pubs in Ireland closed on St. Patrick 's Day . It was one of three holy days ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic calendar that shuttered the public houses of Ireland . <p> Irish communities , O'Faolain says , have long been centered on the pub . There 's the home ; there 's the pub . <p> " Particularly in Ireland , everything is celebrated with drink , " says O'Faolain . " But very slowly it 's being realized that it 's not funny anymore . <p> " It 's as if Ireland became a middle-aged person feeling the pangs . They ca n't keep doing it . And politicians are finally able to talk about the national drink problem without being sneered upon . " <p> O'Faolain just completed the Bay Area leg of a national tour for her most recent book , " Almost There : The Onward Journey of a Dublin Woman " ( Riverhead Books , 2003 ) . <p> The Dublin native , a former university lecturer and Irish Times columnist , now divides her time between Brooklyn and the west of Ireland . Having experienced the saint 's day in both countries , she sees the influence of each upon the other . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't all that young , St. Patrick 's Day was extremely austere , " says O'Faolain , recalling bitter winds that swept down the River Liffey and reddened the legs of a young girl watching the simple parade . <p> " At most , there might be a fleet of vans from the post office or an army motorcycle unit . It was a naive and modest display of the Irish state . " <p> O'Faolain credits America with its parade know-how for changing things . In fact , the first St. Patrick 's Day parade took place in New York in 1762 . Made up of Irish soldiers serving in the English military , they employed their bagpipes and drums in a melodic  --  and patriotic  --  fashion . <p> " Ireland got smart and copied the entertainment values used in American parades , " says O'Faolain . " Instead of just a few dozen baton twirlers , now we 've got displays , lights and music . Any minute , there 'll be nudes ! <p> " It 's even mutated to the point where people compete for ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' murder ' about the gay floats . For years , a guy who made burglar alarms used to win the prize . Well , naturally gays are now taking the top prize . " <p> And you better believe that Catholics in Ireland still begin Patrick 's day by attending Mass . <p> " You have to go . He got us where we are , " says O'Faolain , somewhat surprised at the question . " But I also celebrate the feast of St. Brigid ( Feb. 1 ) . She 's the gal . She was an ancient goddess ( combined with ) a Christian abbess . And the average sort of woman 's libber like myself . " <p> Tens of millions of North Americans claim some percentage of Irish heritage . And numbers from the diaspora of the tribes of Erin lend credence to the theory that more people of Irish descent live in the United States than in Ireland . <p> During the Great Famine of 1845-48 , more than 1 million people in Ireland died . By 1856 , evictions and extreme poverty forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to America . <p> Mixed in with crushing loss and sorrow , these immigrants also carried over the stories and music of a homeland they would never see again . Often , that was all they carried . <p> These immigrants and their stories have proved successful in keeping Irish tradition and pride alive . <p> " The interesting thing here is that I think Irish Americans celebrate St. Patrick 's Day more than the Irish , " says Jordan . " It 's a day of pride . We get a day all to ourselves to celebrate our music and dance and culture and poetry . " <p> The 34-year-old utility plumber works for the San Francisco Water Department and is a member of Local 38 of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union . Jordan also serves as member of the Democratic Central Committee . <p> His love of Irish music and culture was nurtured during his family 's biannual trips to Ireland to visit the relatives of his Dublin-born mother , Breda Rolle . <p> " After dinner with our grandparents , we 'd sit around in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls Jordan . " Doing nothing was not an option . So it was either tell a story , sing a song , play an instrument , dance or do something . My brothers and I always sang . " <p> As the son of Frank Jordan Sr. , the former police chief as well as mayor of San Francisco , Frank Jr . has long experienced the limelight at civic events and community festivals . <p> But today is different . Culann 's Hounds headlines the city of Dublin 's St. Patrick 's Day Festival this weekend , one of the largest such celebrations in Northern California . Jordan and his fellow Irish and Irish American band mates could not be more pleased . <p> Jordan is vocalist and plays the bodhran , an ancient type of frame drum that was traditionally used in warfare . <p> " I really loved the sound of that drum , " said Jordan , recalling his teenage determination to master the tricky instrument . <p> Growing up in San Carlos , Jordan and his brothers were recruited by the San Carlos Boys ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training . <p> But the rest of Jordan 's musical odyssey has been a series of happy accidents . <p> An aunt in Ireland gave him the bodhran he so badly wanted . <p> Older brother Jimmy encouraged him to bring his drum down to a Redwood City pub one night and sit in with a band playing Irish music . Frank hesitated , but decided to go . Once a week for the next two years , Frank cut his teeth on sessions with the Claddagh Band . <p> Colum Conefry , Jordan 's work partner , watched his friend 's passion for Irish music grow . He suggested that Jordan and the band play one night at his sister Kathy McEvoy 's pub , the Blackthorn Tavern . Two years later , Culann 's Hounds is one of the pub 's top attractions . <p> And about four years ago , via a casual get-together with a couple of friends , Jordan unknowingly took the first step along the path of his burgeoning music career . <p> One of them wanted to learn the bodhran . The bongos she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just was n't the right sound . <p> " Well , I guess I was n't much of a teacher because ( she ) decided to go back to the bongos , " says Jordan , laughing . <p> But Jordan , and his bodhran , immediately clicked with ( future band members ) Steve Gardner and Michael Kelleher . The sessions in Kelleher 's Haight Street living room continued . Kevin McDonough and Connall O'Raghallaigh would later join the band . <p> " I did n't realize it at the time , but the reason these guys were getting together with a guitar and fiddle was to help Michael and his wife , Anna , get through mourning over the sudden death of their infant Chloe , " says Jordan . <p> In 2001 , Culann 's Hounds released its first album , dedicated to the memory of Chloe . Twenty-five percent of sales are donated to sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) charities . <p> The ease with which Jordan connects with people and situations bespeaks his Irish heritage . He possesses an innate generosity and charm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's funny , " says Jordan , modestly . " When you 're raised by a Dublin woman , you tend to pick up a lot of the Irish culture . " <p> Jordan looks at the city and sees the Irish people 's long history here . <p> " We 're starting to see a new generation of young Irish kids . My hope is that they will become involved in the music and arts . <p> " I 'd like to see someplace like the Irish Cultural Center develop a center where kids could learn to play the traditional instruments . I do n't want to see the traditional arts fade away . <p> " That 's part of what 's so exciting about being in this band . It 's reviving some of the old-style Irish music that you would n't normally hear outside of Ireland . " <p> ST .
