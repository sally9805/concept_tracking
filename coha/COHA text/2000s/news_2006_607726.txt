<p> There were no bureaus or shelves or closets , so three-time Olympian Sheila Taormina pushed her duffel bags against a wall and claimed one of the two lower bunks in a dormitory provided by the Mexican Olympic Committee that included bare mattresses , one chair , no soap and two roommates . <p> In town last month for a major event in modern pentathlon  --  shooting , fencing , swimming , show jumping and running  --  Taormina had just downed a plate of cold peas and carrots and plain pasta , which a server in the cafeteria scraped off the bottom of a metal warming tray just before the kitchen closed . Dessert was canned fruit , stuffed down as a man hovered over Taormina 's table , tapping his watch face . <p> Nearly 10 years after winning an Olympic gold medal in swimming and 18 years after competing in her first Olympic trials , Taormina , 37 , once again is immersed in the arduous , unstable world of Olympic dreams . She wants to become the first medalist to compete in the modern Olympics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a year in this obscure , low-budget pursuit has been remarkable  --  she is the fifth-ranked woman in the world  --  but filled with inconsistencies . Two months after winning a stunning bronze medal in the season 's first major event in Acapulco , Mexico , in March , she was 31st in Moscow . At these championships , she finished seventh . <p> " It 's been way up and down , " said Taormina , who competed in the triathlon , which involves swimming , cycling and running , at the 2000 and 2004 Games . " One moment , I feel like I 'm getting the hang of this . The next moment I feel like . . . why am I here ? " <p> That question seems rooted less in the obvious difficulty of trying to master three new events than in the purely practical problems of immersion into an underfunded , unappreciated and virtually unknown ( at least in the United States ) discipline at an age in which most of her peers are settling down rather than starting over . This all-consuming endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , dignity , resulting in a personal unrest unlike anything she has ever faced . <p> To fund her training , Taormina put her home in Clermont , Fla. , up for sale . She moved this spring to the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs , where she shares facilities and meals with athletes half her age . She has exhausted her savings while striking out in attempts to persuade sports agents to represent her . <p> " This year , it 's been the biggest test of my life , no question , " Taormina said from a small couch near the stairwell at the Mexican Olympic training center , about 13 hours before the 7 a.m. start of the shooting competition at the Pan American Championships . " I do n't know whether in my youth I was more resilient , but this year I 've thought : ' I 've proven myself . Do n't make me prove myself again , sacrifice to the point I have to sell my house . ' I 'm too old for that . Couple that with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've used is humiliating . It 's been humiliating . " <p> Known for her good humor in competition , she has become prone , she said , to floods of tears set off by the real-world strain . She knew learning to shoot , fence and ride would be hard , but she thought people would seize her dream . She recalls that , after her second Olympics as a triathlete , she received an out-of-the-blue call from the chief of police in a small town who watched her on television and wanted to support her training . She grew accustomed to kindhearted people who believed in her , and generosity that awed her . And there was this , too : When she succeeded , particularly over the last seven years , she earned decent money . <p> She could bring home a $5,000 check from any given race , enough to pay off her credit cards , stash cash in the bank and keep her sanity . Winners in modern pentathlon take home a few hundred dollars at most . <p> Because of her age , expectations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 , the last 19 months have been more difficult , she said , than training for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics  --  where she won a gold medal swimming the third leg of the 800-meter relay as a Georgia graduate with a full-time job and seemingly faint hopes of making the team . They have been harder than switching to triathlon a year before the 2000 Sydney Olympics , where she finished sixth , after competing in her first triathlon on a lark . Harder , she says , than surviving a year in which she was stalked by a man  --  now serving a five-year prison term for the crime  --  who threatened her and left her obscene messages leading up to the 2004 Athens Games , where she finished 23rd after suffering leg cramps . <p> Taormina , who despite falling out of medal contention in Sydney memorably ran the last two miles wearing a broad smile and high-fiving spectators , recently searched the Internet for articles on depression . <p> " I have cried in my house more this year , just crying because I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dream , " said Taormina , a native of Livonia , Mich . " At what point is the dream not worth the cost ? I sit and wonder : Did I make the biggest mistake of my life ? " <p> And yet , questions sprouting all of the time , doubt hovering like a thick fog , her parents and six siblings urging her to reconsider , she continues . She figures it 's part desire to do something no one else has done , part belief she is following God 's plan for her , part faith in her own history of climbing big mountains  --  and part recognition that she is too far in to turn back . <p> " This is my personality to do something like this , " Taormina said . " It will either kill me or I 'll be so happy in the end . One or the other . " <p> Emotional trauma aside , the complexity of this endeavor suits her competitive constitution perfectly . Energized by the contemporary Christian music that flows through her headphones , she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she often does ) , and U.S. pentathlon team coach , Polish-born Janusz Peciak , calls her the best female athlete in the United States , in any sport . If the conditions are right at the 2008 Beijing Olympics , Taormina could become only the second American to win an individual medal in modern pentathlon since the 1960 Rome Olympics . <p> Or she could fail to make the event 's final round . <p> Monica Pinette , a Canadian who won the Pan Am Championships , noted that Taormina always dominates in the 200-meter swim and often the 3,000-meter run , but is susceptible to disasters in the more technical pursuits . <p> " She looks really good until she gets into trouble , " Pinette said . " She just does n't have the experience . " <p> Pentathlete Eli Bremer deserves the credit or blame for this career change . After a swimming session at the U.S. Olympic Training Center before the 2004 Games , Taormina was introduced to Bremer after she emerged from the pool . " When are you switching to pentathlon and becoming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different sports ? " he said . <p> At the time , she did not know the sports that made up pentathlon and had no idea she was on the cusp of history . But the comment stuck . After Athens , Taormina prayed for guidance , bought herself more than $1,000 in ski equipment and moved to an apartment in Marquette , Mich . <p> She decided she was going to become a cross-country skier and try out for the 2006 Winter Games in Turin , Italy . A coach based in Madison , Wis. , joined her on weekends for training . It soon became clear this was not going to work . <p> " I was skiing alone in the freezing cold in a city where I did n't know anybody , " Taormina said . " I had no idea how much money I had spent . After three months of it , I said , ' What am I doing here ? ' " <p> She went home , but the thought of competing at a fourth Olympics in a third sport continued to tempt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a tryout in front of the U.S. pentathlon coaching staff . It was the first time she had ever picked up a gun or fencing saber , and she knew virtually nothing about riding a horse . But her expertise in swimming and running and general athletic acumen impressed the coaches . She almost immediately earned a $500 monthly stipend to compete in the sport . <p> After less than six months of training  --  interrupted by her competing in several triathlons to fulfill an obligation with an old sponsor  --  she won last year 's Pan Am Championships in Buenos Aires . Though the field was relatively weak compared with the World Cup circuit , it still represented a breathtaking debut . <p> Filled with enthusiasm , she called four agents . Not one , she said , was willing to take her on as a client , and one told her flatly over the phone she was " not marketable " and " I could n't get you a penny . " Devastated by the full-throttle rejection , she also was becoming desperate for income streams . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone had grown to $1,500 . Unlike when she was training only for one sport , working full-time was no longer feasible  --  at least , not if she hoped to put herself in Olympic contention in 2008 . <p> Speedo , which had sponsored her since her swimming days , orally agreed to another contract , but a deal she hoped would be quickly executed stalled for months . Deals with Amino Vital , a maker of dietary supplements , and Rudy Project sunglasses helped defray costs , but she needed more . <p> To put her mind at ease , Taormina put her house up for sale and moved to Colorado Springs , where she was welcomed at the training center , which provides qualified athletes with room , board and access to state-of-the-art facilities . <p> But at the World Cup event in Moscow , she fell off her horse twice , producing her most dismal finish of the season . Meantime , the apparent sale of her house fell through . Enough was enough , she thought . Through an avalanche of tears , she told Peciak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the team hotel , finally persuading her not to go . <p> Peciak , who won the Olympic gold at the 1976 Games in Montreal , pointed out that it usually takes eight to 10 years to mold a top pentathlete . Taormina noted that the next Olympics are two years away . <p> " He says , ' In time it will come , ' " Taormina said . " I do n't have time . I 'm not an 18-year-old who has 20 years to learn this . " <p> Watching Taormina in competition , one would never know her mind is burdened . The newest member of the elite team , she already has emerged as a vocal leader , shouting enthusiastically for her teammates throughout the long days of competitions and chattering pleasantly during breaks . In the midst of discussing her struggles with a reporter after a fencing bout , she spotted one of the youngest team members , Suzanne Stettinius , 18 , shaking her head and mumbling miserably to herself . <p> " Suzanne , " Taormina shouted across the competition venue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! " <p> Stettinius trudged over , head hanging , and received an encouraging lecture that produced a reluctant but grateful smile . <p> Taormina does n't , however , aspire to be an overqualified den mother . She wants to succeed , preferably with the individual Olympic medal that has eluded her . Those 12-hour training days are neither uncommon nor unwelcome under the circumstances . When she is training , she has a chance to get better . And when she is training , she does not have to think so much . <p> " I did n't want to have to do well this year  --  I just wanted to improve , " she said . " But if I do n't do well this year , I wo n't pay my bills . I do look up to the heavens and say : ' Do you want me out of this ? Did I hear you wrong ? ' "
