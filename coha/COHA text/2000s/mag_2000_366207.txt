How big was it ? In Northern Virginia on Friday night , Jimmy Lynn , an AOL marketing executive , got an inkling that something was happening . " I usually go to the Redskins games with a guy from the mergers and acquisitions group , " Lynn explained . When the friend canceled  --  for the Redskins ' first playoff game in seven years  --  Lynn knew it was not just something , but really something . In downtown Manhattan early Monday , the 7:30 a.m. daily research call emanating from the fifth-floor conference room of Merrill Lynch headquarters was handled by analysts Henry Blodget and Jessica Reif Cohen . Traders who had nearly run off the road when they had heard the news on their car radios crammed the room ; 1,000 more around the world were connected by telephone . Like everyone else on Wall Street , Blodget and Reif Cohen had been taken totally by surprise . They used words like brilliant and huge  --  but they were at a loss to explain to their colleagues what it actually meant . <P> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced , that the influential Silicon Valley venture capitalist Roger McNamee summed up the object of all this attention : " Let 's be clear , " he said . " This is the single most transformational event I 've seen in my career . " <P> Just what exactly was transformed ? America Online , the newbie-friendly smiley face of the Web that just three years ago was an operational mess , had engineered the largest merger in American corporate history . Time Warner , the immense media conglomerate that had sprung from the loins of the magazine you are now reading  --  having failed to beat the Internet upstarts with its own efforts  --  had decided to surrender to them for the best price it could get , about $162 billion in AOL stock . The companies valued the combination at $350 billion . <P> For Time Warner chief executive Gerald Levin and AOL boss Steve Case , the common experience of groping through a rapidly mutating economy made this deal in some ways inevitable . In AOL , Case had built a brand , a customer base and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced a future that may see Internet access become a commodity , and he lacked access to the leading source of broadband  --  the fat , fast pipes of cable television that could carry vast amounts of Internet content . And Case did n't have much in the way of content either . Time Warner 's cable-television system , the country 's second largest , owned plumbing aplenty to distribute AOL 's services . The company also had the proprietary content  --  magazines , books , movies , music , programming  --  to send down the pipes . <P> Yet Levin 's company had remained inextricably mired in its own past , a dinosaur lurching its way through a world that would soon belong to swifter creatures , almost pathetically unable  --  like all the major media companies  --  to make the Great Leap Forward into the new Internet economy . The company 's stock price had plateaued in a year in which Net stocks soared , and there was little excitement about the plans being developed in its recently hatched digital division , despite projected outlays this year of $500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corporation " to catch up with the established Internet players , notes Time Warner vice chairman Ted Turner . Levin was even contemplating " an internal takeover " of CNN to make it the company 's digital division , separate from the rest of the Turner networks .
