Regan Reilly glanced out the window of the plane she 'd been on for the last five hours , thrilled to finally spot the skyline of Manhattan . It 's great to be back , she thought . This is where I belong . For a lot of reasons . Not the least of which was her new beau  --  the head of the Major Case Squad in New York City  --  one Jack Reilly , who thank God was no relation . A private investigator in Los Angeles , thirty-one-year-old Regan was planning to attend the crime convention that her mother , mystery writer Nora Regan Reilly , had organized with a handful of her fellow authors . Regan 's father , Luke , the owner of three funeral homes in New Jersey , would be there too . It was at Christmastime , when her father had been kidnapped , that Regan had met Jack Reilly . They 'd been involved in a coast-to-coast romance for three months . " I 'd do anything that would result in your happiness , Regan , " Luke had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " even be kidnapped . " Yes , Jack makes me happy , Regan mused as the wheels of the plane smoothly hit the pavement and the pilot taxied to the gate with no delays . At the baggage claim Regan was inordinately pleased that for once her suitcases were among the first to be spit down the chute . She hoisted them onto the cart she 'd rented and hurried out to grab a cab . There was only one person on the taxi line . This is all so easy today , Regan thought . Too easy . Something 's got to go wrong . But even though it was after five o'clock on a Thursday , her cab made great time getting into the city . As they passed the Plaza Hotel and headed across Central Park South , Regan smiled . Almost there , she thought . She 'd be joining her parents at the convention 's opening cocktail party and then for dinner . Jack had an awards ceremony he had to attend out on Long Island , but she 'd see him tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ' apartment , Regan felt the familiar sense of comfort that she always experienced when she walked through the door . She quickly showered , changed into a black dress , the nighttime uniform in the city , and hurried out . The cocktail party was still in full swing . Nora spotted Regan the minute she arrived , her maternal instinct on its usual red alert . " Regan , you 're here ! " Nora exclaimed happily as she hurried over to greet her only child . Several hours later , Regan , Nora , and Luke were finishing a festive dinner at the Gramercy Tavern . All the tables were filled , and the bar was bustling . " That was delicious , " Regan said as she looked around the busy restaurant . " This is the perfect place to kick off the weekend . I do n't get down to this neighborhood enough . " Little did she know that , less than two blocks away , a crime was taking place . A crime that would bring her back to Gramercy Park much sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk in the living room of his splendid penthouse apartment and sighed happily . A few feet away , the door to his safe was open , and all its contents were spread out lovingly in front of him . With a hint of mist in his eyes , he gazed down at his deceased wife , Wendy 's , engagement and wedding rings ; the pearls he had given her on their first anniversary ; the silly little ring they 'd gotten out of a Cracker Jack box that Wendy had always treasured even more than her real jewelry . All the bracelets and earrings and necklaces and pins he had bought her over the years were here . Each and every bauble and trinket , cheap or expensive , held a special memory . Nat had been a jeweler for fifty years . A few days ago , he and his buddy and fellow jeweler Ben had decided to donate the proceeds from the sale of four precious diamonds they 'd owned secretly for almost half a century to their ailing Settlers ' Club in honor of its one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since their early thirties , and Nat had been in residence at the club for most of his life . The club , founded by an eccentric for " pioneering people with spirit , " and located on beautiful Gramercy Park in New York City , had in its heyday been a favored gathering place for social , political , and artistic leaders , a mecca for cultural events . Its membership of " pioneers " had consisted of men and women with a broad range of occupations and personalities , and included a fair share of oddballs . But now the club was suffering the fate of many similar clubs and was in danger of closing . Membership was down , the place was in disrepair , and funds were low . It was sneeringly referred to by some as the " Settled Down Club . " With the anniversary party coming up , Nat and Ben had decided they should put their money where their hearts were , so to speak , sell their diamonds , and fork over what would amount to four million dollars to the club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Nat chuckled . Nat had also decided it was high time to make some final decisions about who would get Wendy 's jewelry . When he was gone , he wanted the baubles to be appreciated . But while he was alive he could n't bear the thought of Wendy 's jewels adorning another woman 's body . He conducted his private , loving inventory and was about to put the jewelry back in the safe when once again his eyes fell on the special red-velvet jewelry case . Nat 's hands trembled slightly as he reached for it . Cradling the case in his outstretched palms , he opened it carefully and stared at the four large and brilliant diamonds that in a matter of days would be turned into cold , hard cash . " I hate to say good-bye to you guys after fifty years of togetherness , but this club of ours really needs the dough . " Nat laughed and placed the box back down on the desk . A surge of excitement coursed through his veins , and he clapped his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Helping this club fix itself up . The big one hundredth anniversary party on Saturday night . More parties to celebrate throughout the year . Ben and I will be at the helm of it all . It sure brightens up a dreary March . The raw wind outside suddenly seemed to penetrate the apartment . Nat pulled his bathrobe closer and looked around at his living room appreciatively . The glorious wood paneling , the antique furniture , the wrought iron staircase that led up to a balcony with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves , the tops of which overlooked the couch , the fireplace , and the pair of life-sized sheep that were perched in front of the window . Nat and Wendy had bought them early in their marriage because they reminded her of her childhood days on a sheep farm in England . Over the years , Nat had surprised her with any sheep knickknacks he could get his hands on . But the two stuffed sheep were her favorites . They were the children she never had . She loved them so much that when she made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died three years ago , it was with the understanding that when she and Nat were both dead , the club would take those sheep and put them in a place of honor in the front parlor . Yes indeed , this has been a wonderful place to live for more than fifty years , Nat thought . Ben and I made the right decision to be such generous souls and make sure it keeps going ! He jumped up , grabbed the red box , and walked over to the sheep , whom he and Wendy had named Dolly and Bah-Bah . He pulled the two glass stones out of Dolly 's eye sockets and replaced them with two of the diamonds . He then repeated the procedure on Bah-Bah , stood back , and smiled . " The eyes have it ! " He laughed . " You two look like a million bucks . Your mama , Wendy , loved it when you slept with the diamonds in your eyes . She said you were her precious jewels . This is one of the last nights your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the strands of wool that were their bangs over their now valuable eyes and patted them both . He dropped the glass stones into the red box and replaced it on the desk . I 'll take my shower and then close up shop here , he thought with a smile . He shuffled down the long hallway and through his bedroom . In the opulent marble master bathroom , Nat turned on the jets in the shower full force . " That 'll feel good on these old bones , " he muttered as he walked past the oversize Jacuzzi and back into his bedroom , closing the bathroom door behind him . " Warm it up a little in there first , " he said . The ten o'clock news would just be starting . He lay down on his bed , grabbed the remote control , and flicked on the television . What a day , he thought , chuckling happily . Making plans to give away several million bucks can really tire you out . Nat closed his eyes for what he thought would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a start , the clock on the bedside table read 10:38 . Nat pulled his eighty-three-year-old body up and slid down off the old-fashioned four-poster bed that his dear wife had purchased three decades ago at a most serendipitous garage sale . As he pushed open the bathroom door , a wall of steam enveloped him . " Ahhhhhh , " he grunted as he took off his bathrobe and hung it on a hook . But something was wrong . He peered through the steam and stepped toward the Jacuzzi . It was filled with water . " What ? " he said aloud as fear clutched his heart . " I did n't turn this on ... did I ? " " No , you did n't . " Startled , Nat spun around . He started to speak , but before the words came out , an intruder emerged from the steam and gave Nat a forceful shove that sent him hurtling backward into the Jacuzzi . Nat 's head banged against the side of the tub before it slid below the surface of the water . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled into a nearly motionless state , swaying ever so gently with the movement of the slowly calming water . " It 's a shame how many people lose their lives when they slip in the tub . A crying shame . " A moment later , the shower jets were turned off and the inside of the stall had been wiped dry .
