Fear of failure is a great motivator . Hate also works nicely in a pinch . You do n't see these emotions in Caroline Brunet 's face . They manifest themselves in how the world 's best female kayaker trains , how she thinks and how she speaks . With refreshing un-Canadian candor she tells you , " I hate losing more than I love to win . " It 's been her mantra , first in French , then in English , since age 13 , when she won her first race at home in Lac Beauport , Que . <P> Many Canadian athletes say they 're thrilled just to go to the Olympics and will happily settle for a " personal best . " Brunet does n't toe that party line . " The Canadian way is to think , ' O.K. , go out , do your best and have fun , ' " she says . " For me it 's not enough to go to the Olympics to participate . I 'm never satisfied . " <P> World-championship medals are n't enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kayak world , winning eight of the nine gold medals available in K-1 , or solo , events . But it 's like having a closet full of shoes and nothing to wear . " They 're nice , but they 're not enough , " she says . " I could win 20 times in a row at the worlds , but I need to know I have succeeded in this sport . To really do that , you need to win at the Olympics . " <P> Sydney will be her fourth Olympics , but the first in which she is a favorite . At Seoul in 1988 , as a shy 19-year-old , she was 13th . " When I think back , I was soooo naive , " she laughs . In 1992 she improved and finished seventh . <P> She concluded that doing things the Canadian way was just not good enough . She revamped her training program , settled in Denmark and hired former world canoe champion Christian Frederiksen as her coach . ( He also was for a time her lover . ) Brunet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sec . She thought silver was O.K. until the replay showed how close she was to gold . " That made it worse , " she says , " Even now it bothers me . " <P> Losing in Sydney , no doubt , would bother her more . So she trains 30 hours a week : 20 on water , 10 in the gym . " After I retire , " she vows , " I 'll never go into another gym again . " The grind of a sport that has no off-season has left Brunet , 31 , with nagging shoulder and hip pain in her sturdy 152-lb. , 5-ft. 8-in. frame , and scar tissue from muscle rubbing on bone in her behind . " My bum is so sore , " she says , voicing the kayaker 's lament . <P> Brunet is hedging her bets in a way , opting to add the K-2 , or two-person kayaking , challenge by teaming with Karen Furneaux , 23 , an Olympic rookie . " It 's the first time for me sharing anything , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to share victory . It 's nice to share good moments . This is something I 've found out very late .
