<p> A little more than three months ago , a former interstate pipeline chief executive named John Somerhalder took the reins at AGL Resources , the Atlanta-based parent company of Atlanta Gas Light and Georgia Natural Gas . Somerhalder joined the company just as his former employer , El Paso Corp. , was wrapping up a legislative battle with AGL over a proposed pipeline to the Georgia coast . <p> Since then , Somerhalder has been settling in  --  as AGL 's new CEO and as an Atlantan . The company he now heads is a different beast than the one his predecessor , Paula Rosput , took over in the 1990s . AGL Resources now has gas companies in five states besides Georgia , a retail gas marketing business  --  Georgia Natural Gas  --  and a Houston-based wholesale energy management company . <p> The company 's new CEO now has a new house in Buckhead and , starting this month , will be living in the same city as his wife for the first time in years . <p> Q : How did you get into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical engineer . I graduated from the University of Arizona and ... I found a little company down in Texas that was in this line of work and went to work for them . I worked for them for 30 years . <p> It was El Paso Natural Gas back then . There were three or four major mergers later , but it was a little company to start out with . It became a very large one . <p> ... Believe it or not , one of the opportunities I had was to go to Cincinnati and work for Procter &; Gamble . My kids asked me why I did n't take that job and I said , well , what they wanted me to do was research Crest toothpaste . Actually , I should not have said I made that decision . The way it came out , I do n't think they ever offered me a chance to go work on Crest toothpaste . They interviewed me . <p> Q : They picked up on your enthusiasm ? <p> A : Well , the end result was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like it offered a lot of opportunities . The company was then into so many alternative ways of producing natural gas . They were looking at LNG liquefied natural gas and turning coal into natural gas . It was a very interesting business . <p> The base business was running a pipeline system from West Texas into California . But because there was such a shortage of natural gas then , in the ' 70s , people were thinking of a lot of alternative ways to producing natural gas . <p> Q : And now we 're back there again ? <p> A : We are . A lot of the initiatives we 're trying to move forward on are intended to make sure that we have more access to the natural gas that 's already here and more access to sources like LNG . <p> Q : You were with the part of El Paso Corp . that did n't get involved in some of the 1990s Enron-like energy trading business . You list one of your favorite books as " The Smartest Guys in the Room , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think when you read it ? <p> A : Well , unfortunately or fortunately , I knew a lot of the people who were seriously impacted by that , either directly or indirectly . So , you know , part of what you think is a sense of sadness . A lot of people with good intentions and obviously some with  --  well , there were rumors of not the best of intentions  --  ended up with a business that should have been fundamentally good . ... That that business could go so wrong ... <p> But it 's also a valuable lesson . When I look at what we do as a company  --  the assets and people that we have providing service to customers , managing the business , trying to minimize the impact of high natural gas prices  --  keeping your focus there is the right thing , rather than this more speculative unbounded growth you saw in the Enron era , without having the assets and systems in place behind it . <p> Q : What do n't people understand about this business ? <p> A : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is a tie not just to this country 's demand to oil but to a global demand for oil . I would think people do n't know how global the pricing has become . The prices of oil and gas are tied , because gas is used in the power industry to generate energy , and in industry , and that competes with oil . And when oil prices get high , more natural gas gets used , and that tends to pull up the price of natural gas . <p> Q : Where will new supply come from ? <p> A : A lot of the incremental gas that will come online in the next four to five years , and that has come on in last four to five years , is from the Rocky Mountains area . The problem there has been access . A lot of it is on federal lands and the permitting process is very , very slow and cumbersome . Then you need pipes to move it away from there . <p> There 's also shale in East Texas . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , and we 're working to get access to that for our customers . And then even though the Gulf of Mexico was impacted by the hurricanes , there are still very good prospects there , and a lot of that is now coming back online . Longer term , there 's Alaska and the Northwest Territories . So if you start out with Rockies , East Texas and the Gulf Coast , and the long term is Alaska , the only way you bridge the gap between them is imported liquefied natural gas . <p> Q : Have you moved into your house ? Is your family here ? <p> A : We close on a home next week . When we first made the decision to buy it , it was before the leaves were out . Now it 's like ' Wow ! Atlanta really is beautiful . ' Now that all the trees are out , with the rolling hills . ... Well , it 's a little different than New Mexico . <p> Q : Did n't you come here from Houston ? <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in New Mexico . We thought it would be short term . But you know , once kids get entrenched in an area , it 's kind of hard to move them . I commuted every other weekend . Rebecca and I are not going to do that again . <p> Q : What has been your most rewarding moment ? <p> A : Well , this is kind of a stupid one . One day , my 2-year-old granddaughter took a piece of ice , and she was playing with it on a glass table . And the ice is just about gone and she looks at me and says ' Look , Papa . Ice is frozen water . ' There 's no way she could have connected all that . Maybe her other grandfather told her . But if she did connect it , wow . At the time I raised my kids I was so busy that I did n't appreciate as many of those moments . It was the highlight of my last three months . <p> THE SOMERHALDER FILE <p> * Hometown : Burlington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hobbies : Mountain biking , snowboarding with his four children and two grandchildren <p> * Favorite movies : " Forrest Gump " and old Humphrey Bogart and Sidney Poitier movies . <p> * Favorite books : " The Sun Also Rises , " " Cannery Row , " " Catcher in the Rye , " " Atlas Shrugged , " " The Da Vinci Code " and " The Smartest Guys in the Room " <p> * Favorite snack : Fresca <p> * Volunteer work : United Way , Habitat for Humanity , Brickmaker Project in Juarez , Mexico ( to convert the kilns of poor brick makers from the use of contaminated fuels that cause environmental and health problems ) <p> * Favorite quote : " Anger is never without reason but seldom with a good one .
