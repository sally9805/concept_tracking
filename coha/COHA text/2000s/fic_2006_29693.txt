Chapter One As far as he was concerned , the great tragedy in the otherwise comfortable life of His Royal Highness the Prince of Gallagher was that he knew from the time he was twelve that he could not , would not , should not even dream of marrying for love . His mother and father had made that clear . On the rare occasions when the royal family dined alone , they would always go on and on about the troubles that had recently plagued their British cousins in the House of Windsor . The scandals , the divorces , the unending criticisms of the royal family . " But that , " King Philippe would proclaim , " is what happens when heirs to the throne do not marry wisely . " So Raphael began to settle into the notion that he must marry sensibly . He could n't be bothered with what he might personally find attractive or interesting ; he was to think solely about the good of the country and of his family . He had to find a woman who was handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was too caught up in looks and fashion and all of that . Such interests , he observed , brought nothing but trouble . In fact , it would be preferable if the woman in question had no interests at all . The ability to feign interest-that was the important quality in a princess . A princess-orprince , for that matter-who is genuinely interested in things is bound to start thinking that the clinic she 's touring might need money more than it needs royal visitors , or that the Saudi government 's desire to dress her in black garb on state visits is inexcusable , or that , my word , Prince Andrew really is an old bore and must they invite him to the wedding , third cousin or not ? Far from the popular notion of a princess being privileged and spoiled , a good princess is the most undemanding of creatures . She smiles at anything placed before her . She is impressed by anything people attempt to impress her with . ( " Well now , look at how the children used macaroni to spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've never seen its equal ! " ) Above all , she must be absolutely uninterested in her own feelings , which are the hallmark conversation topic of common women . Such nonsense , Prince Raphael had noted , tended to annoy even his professors at school , educated but common men , all of them . So for a crowned prince like himself , well , it would just be ... unbearable . No , his parents were quite right . He should not marry for love . At least that was his thinking as a boy , and as I said , he later considered it one of the great tragedies of his life . But if you assume , therefore , that the prince did not love Isabella Cordage , then you are assuming a bit much . For the truth is , despite all that talk of duty and family loyalty and the good of the country and other such sensible nonsense , when it came time for Raphael to marry , he paid no more attention to his parents than most young men do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just did n't admit to doing so . And the fact that she had some noble ties and was very presentable and could feign interest at even the most dreadful exhibit of mid-twentieth-century household tools was so much the better . The truth was , he adored her . He just did n't realize it . He had known Isabella , of course , since he was a small child . Her father was of minor but storied nobility , having inherited the title " Earl of Cordage " from the legendary man-child who had , six centuries earlier , played such a critical role in the War of the Hundred Hills . But there is no need to get bogged down in that sort of familiar history . The point is that her minor nobility was just enough to make Isabella Cordage a suitable playmate for the little future king . So she was among about two dozen children , all about the prince 's age , who were regularly summoned to the castle-via elegant hand-painted invitations , of course-for small circuses and large birthday parties . At first they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unconcerned with their differences in gender or the degree of their nobility . But as the years wore on , the relationships became more strained . The boys and girls resented the adult expectations ( which , by puberty , hung in the air like the stifling humidity of the worst summers along the Bisbanian Sea ) that they would , out of all the world , date and marry only within this small circle . Furthermore , the boys resented that they were so obviously a mere consolation prize compared to one particular classmate . The girls , meanwhile , were annoyed that in the whole melodrama of their young and difficult lives , the only story anyone cared about was which of them would marry Rafie . Isabella , being among the least noble of the children , perhaps resented the whole thing more than most . In her teenage years , she developed-in addition to a small acne problem and the fine , flyaway hair that she battled through life-a tart tongue and smart attitude with His Highness , once famously going so far as to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crown about as desirable as a man with a sexually transmitted disease . " If she wants money , there are plenty of men who have that , " she said , loudly enough to be overheard by guests at the largest ball of Bisbania 's summer racing season . " And if she wants fame , a good rock star will do nicely . What does marrying a king get you except endless grief , tawdry speculation about your reproductive system , and a steady stream of editorials saying you 're too formal and frumpy or else asking why you do n't carry yourself with more grace and poise ? A princess ca n't win , can she ? If I were you , I 'd worry about whether anyone would have me . " Not even a flicker of reaction passed over the prince 's face as he replied simply : " How interesting . " And he walked away . Isabella was unreasonably flustered by his even , royal response . The prince , despite his decorum , was hurt and strangely intrigued . There were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her : Why does n't she like me ? But do not misunderstand . This is not one of those predictable romantic comedies in which the man and the woman spit fire at each other for dozens of episodes before falling completely in love . It is true that Isabella and Raphael were often curt , sour , or standoffish with each other . But it was n't so bad as all that . They were just children , after all . They sparred at times , but they also quite enjoyed each other . The tabloids reported the " sexually transmitted disease " comment many times over the years , but they mostly never bothered with what happened a few days later , when Raphael and Isabella saw each other at the races and Isabella , who had managed to find a way to pull her problem hair into an attractive bun , tried to smooth things over . " Oh , Rafie , " she said , " I 'm afraid I was dreadful the other night . I was trying to start a philosophical discussion about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out like some sort of disrespectful rebuke . " She smiled here in what she hoped was a winsome way and pinched his arm in a friendly guy-chum manner . " I 'm sure you 'll find a woman who is quite up to the job , " she said . " Someone who will not only appreciate you for your own sweet nature but will think of all the good she will someday do as queen . " Raphael brushed off the incident as though he barely remembered it . " Oh , of course , I knew quite what you were getting at . If I appeared put off , I was just rather distracted by the visiting grand duchess . She does take quite a lot of attention . " Then they smiled weakly and cheered the horses , and Isabella cashed a very nice ticket by correctly putting a little money on a long shot named Apology Accepted . ( I assure you that truly was the horse 's name . For all my faults , I 'm not so silly and pedestrian as to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name is ever completely insignificant . You can tell so much about people by what they chose to be called . And people do choose for themselves , ultimately . Your mother might call you Araminta , but you can introduce yourself as Minty or Ara or Tiny or-why not ? - Scooter . You have a choice , and the choice you make reveals much about you . But a horse , of course , has no choice at all , and the name he is given does not , to the dismay of amateur bettors anywhere , have any impact on his racing ability . So the name Apology Accepted was , as I said , completely insignificant . ) After Isabella 's apology , everything went on much the same as before . If anything , her friendship with Raphael warmed a bit . Isabella was always the prince 's first choice when he needed a partner in a card game . And it was always a sweet relief to be seated next to her at state dinners , which would often happen if there was no visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raphael knew who did n't start looking around the room in a distracted way when he shared his thoughts on the ethics of using drug therapy for lisping problems in children . ( The mechanics of speech were an interest of his . ) And she had a wonderful little wiggle in her waltz that he admired on the dance floor . At the racetrack , she shouted and yelped in a lusty manner when her horse was headed toward the finish , so unlike most of Bisbania 's noblewomen , who would merely clap their hands in a patty-cake fashion : fingers pointed straight upward and palms tapping together in an unenthusiastic , robotic motion . Once he believed that he even heard Isabella call out , " Move it , nag face , " as her horse headed down the stretch . But when he asked her to repeat herself , she claimed to have been clearing her throat . " I have a bit of a cold , " she said . Isabella was a delight . So no one should be surprised that Raphael found himself smitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American school where she picked up some appalling Americanisms as well as a master 's degree in art history and a preference for lower-cut blouses . Gone was any teenage brittleness , and they quickly fell into a routine of riding and tennis and conversations that lasted a bit longer than average in receiving lines at holiday banquets . Then one day Raphael 's valet , Vreeland , mentioned while selecting the prince 's wardrobe that Edwina , the crowned princess of the Selbar Isles , was growing into quite a young woman , and the prince suddenly realized what had happened . It was all over . Without so much as a kiss or any event that you could call a date , without consulting his parents or Vreeland or any of the assorted advisers who had chosen his school and his major and even his hobbies , Raphael had chosen a wife . And she was not Edwina , the crowned princess of the Selbar Isles . She was Isabella . Raphael acted upon this decision with all of his characteristic impulsiveness and insensitivity , failing to appear for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining that he was busy selecting mushy poetry to send to Isabella . Obviously , this not only crushed Edwina 's fragile ego but also angered her father , King of the Selbar Isles and Beaches , and thus caused endless grief for King Philippe . In fact , the missed snorkeling date is the real reason behind that year 's devastating Bisbania-Selbar Isles waterway dispute , the one that stranded fishing boats , tourist ferries , and , rather famously , a certain former U.S. president in the company of an attractive young woman ( not his wife ) . But none of that mattered to Raphael , who argued to his father that if Edwina was going to be as sensitive as all that , she would have made a horrible Bisbanian queen anyway . Isabella , he suggested , would have handled a canceled date with far more panache , though he did not plan on testing the matter . For Raphael did not even once stand Isabella up , though their relationship did have the usual peaks and valleys . There are some biographies out there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will tell you about their first kiss and their first argument . These biographies will tell you exactly how many times Isabella considered moving back to America and how many times Raphael thought that Bisbania was perhaps ready for a bachelor king . But I do n't want to tell that story , and you do n't want to hear it . They were just two young kids dating . They had , in the parlance of the time , " issues . " Who cares ? If you want that story , you can get plenty of it at your local junior college . Just go sit in the cafeteria and ask some woman how her boyfriend is . You 'll hear enough , and it will be no different from this . Here is all you need to know : They dated for two years . He hinted at his intentions . She expressed reservations . He persevered . His parents were concerned because Isabella could be a bit of a handful , but they could hardly complain , given that they had included her in the circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was supposed to be the one who made the others look good , " Queen Regina hissed to her husband when they recognized what was going on . ) Finally , they went for that walk in the gardens of Glassidy Castle , and Raphael put his question to Isabella in a simple , straightforward way . " Please , Isabella , " he started . Then , in a calculated attempt to use less formal language , he finished with " Wo n't you marry me ? " Isabella said yes . They held a press conference . And when some silly young reporter asked her if she was ready for the royal family , she threw back her head , laughed , and said , " Maybe the question is : ' Are they ready for me ? ' " The media would play that bit a million times over the years , and it became a standard piece of her story . But that only goes to show you the power people have when they 're the ones editing your video . You could point to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as easily could point to the moment earlier , when someone asked how she felt and she said : " Humbled , really . All I want is to be a good wife and someday a good queen . " Did either comment really mean anything ? We 'll see . As I said , I do n't editorialize until the end . The announcement was a big hit and got a good deal of world attention . Ever since the troubles in the House of Windsor , the world rejoices when a seemingly mature , suitable woman becomes engaged to a prince . ( Even if it 's just the Prince of Gallagher , the heir to a mere slip of a throne , the kingship of a tiny city-nation so snugly nestled between the Bisbanian Sea and the southernmost Alps that , for many centuries , it could be reached only by foolhardy climbers and expert seamen . ) To help with the wedding preparations , the castle immediately assigned Isabella a maidservant , a middle-aged woman named Secrest who had recently inherited the job from her mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions were often handed from one generation to another , assuming the family had the appropriate work ethic and skill at keeping secrets . ) Isabella , in a meaningless burst of egalitarianism , insisted that Secrest 's job title be changed from maidservant to " royal associate . " The formal proclamation , signed by the princess in what now seems a youthful , carefree hand , incorrectly lists Secrest 's name as Secresta . But neither the name nor the title made much difference to Secrest , who did not get a raise or even a noticeable increase in respect with the " promotion . " The change did , however , make the appropriate splash in the tabloids-and the more serious media . Conventional wisdom suggested that using nonservile titles like " royal associate " demonstrated Isabella 's thoroughly modern spirit . " I 'll associate with this royal any day , " Ethelbald Candeloro wrote in the gushing style typical of the media during the engagement . So the world celebrated . Stamps were issued . Plates were created . Oh , you remember the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old enough to remember-which , silly me , I guess most of you are n't ( it 's been so long ago ! ) - then just think about one of the other recent weddings , and you 've got the idea . They 're all the same , really . Isabella wore white , of course . But she made a bit of a splash by having some color woven into the silk gown . The neckline was embroidered with a royal blue pattern of tulips , a tribute to some Dutch blood on her mother 's side . Around the wrists and hem , the tulips were red . It was stunning . You forget now how stunning and bold and beautiful it was . It was copied so much later that it became sort of clich . Another great idea spoiled by mass production . But is n't that always the way ? ( Continues ... )
