<p> THESE days , when MySpace and YouTube seem as ubiquitous as television and newspapers , it can be tough to remember that just eight years ago the Internet was still a gee-whiz curiosity for most people . But 1999 was the year online entertainment really began , not with grainy streaming video but with a game that let millions of players explore a vibrant 3-D fantasy world for the first time . <p> It had a lot of familiar elements , like monsters and treasure hunts . But in this world the brawny barbarian you were fighting beside or the mysterious wizard in the corner of the tavern was n't a clunky computer construct . It was the on-screen apparition of another player , who might be huddled over a keyboard thousands of miles away . <p> The game was EverQuest , the unlikely brainchild of young fantasy fans including Brad McQuaid who had been toiling away in an obscure division of Sony . By 2001 EverQuest , with Mr. McQuaid as producer , had almost 500,000 players , each paying a tidy $15 a month for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some  --  immersed in a virtual world . <p> For Mr. McQuaid it was a heady time . Having wanted to be a game designer since eighth grade , he had poured himself into EverQuest and soon found himself anointed a " Game God " by PC Gamer , one of the industry 's top magazines . <p> " No one really knew what to expect , so when EverQuest just took off , it was really more overwhelming and bewildering than it was a top-of-the-world feeling , " he recalled recently . " It was great to know we had made such a popular world . " <p> EverQuest was a huge leap in gaming but in some ways ahead of its time , which was not lost on its core audience of tech-savvy young men . Some of the savviest were working just up the freeway from Sony 's offices , at Blizzard Entertainment . After investing hundreds of hours playing EverQuest , they set out to take online gaming to a global , mass-market level by making a game that would be more accessible for casual players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was World of Warcraft , today 's online megastar with more than eight million subscribers around the world . Not only is its audience far bigger than EverQuest 's ( which is now around 350,000 ) , but its welcoming design has attracted a far broader and more loyal fan base , at least for now . <p> Now , after watching the industry he essentially created all but pass him by , Mr. McQuaid is back . After spending five years and more than $30 million bouncing from Sony to Microsoft and back to Sony , he has returned with a new bid to become the No. 1 dream maker for the millions of people who spend their leisure time online . <p> His new game , Vanguard : Saga of Heroes , opened on Jan. 30 . But in a surprising twist Mr. McQuaid is n't pinning his hopes on appealing to World of Warcraft 's millions of casual players . Instead , Vanguard is a gamer 's game . While World of Warcraft uses a cartoony visual style that runs fine on slower computers , Vanguard can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realism and its huge , richly detailed virtual universe . Where the older game tries to impress with its accessibility , Vanguard is about more complexity , more choices . In short Mr. McQuaid is bucking the conventional wisdom of a $2 billion industry . <p> He says he 's going after " players who are looking for something deeper , more like a home . " He adds , " I do n't expect to get six or seven million players , but if we have 500,000 by the end of the year and keep growing after that , I 'll be happy . " <p> In that sense Mr. McQuaid is like an auteur who turns down a midsummer action blockbuster in favor of pursuing his own personal , if less commercial , vision . And as in Hollywood that obsession can cause conflicts with the people paying the bills . <p> IF Vanguard is a gamer 's game , it is because Mr. McQuaid , 37 , is a gamer 's gamer . His journey from fan to designer and executive almost perfectly reflects the evolution of computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their middle and late 30s Mr. McQuaid was part of the first generation to discover computers in childhood . His first encounter with online gaming came in the early ' 80s through single-player role-playing games , in which players could go off and explore a two-dimensional countryside in search of monsters ( but could never meet , much less interact , with other real people ) . The experience transformed him . <p> " I realized that unlike reading a book or watching a movie , where you 're just following the protagonist , in a game you could actually be the protagonist , and that was the closest thing to actually being in a fantasy world , " Mr. McQuaid said . " In a book , if the guy goes right , he goes right . If he goes in the tunnel , you never have any control over that . But in a game you get to make those decisions , and ever since that moment I wanted to be a computer game designer . That 's all I ever wanted to do . " <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Wide Web , Mr. McQuaid and thousands of other Internet pioneers discovered the first global multiuser dungeon games , or MUDs . MUDs did n't use any graphics at all ( players would type commands like " kill orc " ) , but for the first time the other characters in the game were being played by real people  --  other players , just like themselves . They could talk to other players in real time , then go off to rescue the princess together . It was a far cry from sitting alone at a computer , and some players spent so many hours typing away that the games came to be known as Multiple Undergraduate Destroyers . <p> " When I started playing MUDs , it was like the light bulb went on a second time , " Mr. McQuaid said . " What brought me in were the social aspects . You 'd see these high-level people running by and want to emulate them . And what really fascinated me even then was how the players could get completely obsessed with these kind of games , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for 10 , 12 , 16 hours a day . " <p> Meanwhile a young executive at Sony named John Smedley started looking for a team to take a real production budget and make a graphical version of a MUD . Casting around , he found WarWizard 2 , a crude shareware game that Mr. McQuaid , who was tending the computers at a plant nursery at the time , had posted online . <p> " I had put my phone number on WarWizard 2 , just in case anyone wanted to call and publish it , and the phone just rang out of the blue one night and it was this guy calling with the idea of making a 3-D MUD , " Mr. McQuaid recalled . " I gave two weeks ' notice at the nursery the next morning . " <p> Three years later EverQuest was released , to great acclaim , and Sony quickly kicked Mr. McQuaid upstairs . By 2001 he was overseeing a half-dozen game projects for the company . He had become an important figure in the industry , but something was missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't getting that sense of accomplishment I had with EverQuest , " he said . " It just was n't hands-on . You 're just walking around talking to producers and executive producers , and you 're very distant from the actual creative process . " <p> So in late 2001 he struck out on his own , starting a new company named Sigil Games ( after Crimson Sigil , his guild in his favorite MUD ) to keep chasing his eighth-grade dream . Publishers were basically throwing money at him , especially Microsoft , which was eager to catch up to its rivals . <p> But the continual march of technology and expectations had changed things forever . He made WarWizard with a couple of friends in his apartment , and the full-time team on the original EverQuest topped out at about two dozen people . But these days making a top-notch game is as much an organizational challenge as it is a technical and creative one . <p> " Originally we thought that if we did EverQuest in three years we could do this game in three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our design was and how other games raised the bar , " he said . " Twenty-three guys and three years was n't going to cut it anymore . Now we have 110 people on one project . Figuring out how to set that up with different levels of managers and teams was quite a learning experience , and it cost us a lot of time and money . " <p> And two and a half years into that learning curve World of Warcraft roared onto the market and eclipsed its rivals . <p> As the years passed and the price tag neared $20 million , Microsoft began to lose patience with Mr. McQuaid , who insisted on adding more virtual landscape and other features to the game . By 2005 Microsoft was focused on introducing the Xbox 360 console and was looking for someone to take Vanguard off its hands . ( Microsoft representatives declined to discuss the matter in detail . ) <p> Mr. Smedley , at Sony , was happy to oblige . " We just did n't have enough in the pipeline , " recalled Mr. Smedley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division . " This was an opportunity to pick up a game that looked great , played great and fit into our release schedule . " <p> So early last year the companies announced , somewhat awkwardly , that Vanguard had returned to the Sony lineup . But as recently as six weeks ago Sony still had not announced a date for introducing the game . Furthermore the beta version  --  available to testers  --  was still embarrassingly incomplete . At Sigil 's anonymous low-slung office building in Carlsbad , Calif. , after five years in development , the effort to whip the game into shape became a frenzy . <p> " In the last six weeks there have definitely been people sleeping here , " Mr. McQuaid said . " Come in at 3 a.m. on the weekends and there are programmers quashing bugs , people working on server issues . " <p> David Gilbertson , Vanguard 's producer , met Mr. McQuaid riding dirt bikes in the desert in 1991 . " Brad tells me what to do , and I make it happen , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to figure out what 's broken , and keeping more than 100 ducks in a row can be a real challenge . But we 've had people here 24 hours a day for a while now . I do n't think we 've had to turn on the alarm system in two months . " <p> I JUMPED into the retail version of Vanguard soon after it went online two weeks ago and from the beginning found it to be standard high-fantasy fare . <p> I began by creating a human cleric and entering the game near the once-peaceful rural village of Tursh . Very quickly I learned that Tursh has problems : the local wizards ' academy had recently mysteriously exploded , unleashing a plague of demons . And if that were n't enough , the corpses of farmers that had been resting in peace at the local cemetery had risen from the dead . Naturally , I joined with other players to help save the town . <p> And so it goes . If I had created a goblin , I would have started my new life on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elven sorcerer I would first appear in the enchanted woods outside the city of Leth Nurae . All through the virtual world thousands of other players are starting their own journeys in search of adventure and new friends . <p> The general reaction to Vanguard has been mixed . Almost no one in the industry or online seems to think that it will overtake World of Warcraft any time soon , not least because the game seems to have glitches and crash occasionally for most users . But the vitriol of just a couple of months ago , when gamers found the test versions almost unplayable , has given way to grudging respect that Sigil pulled together a product worthy of its heritage . Both Mr. McQuaid and Sony acknowledge that Vanguard is still rough around the edges and that they pushed it out the door basically because the money ran out . <p> " Microsoft had wanted to launch this thing in July of 2006 , " Mr. Smedley said . " We felt like the game needed more time , and we have given it more time , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ship the game and start generating revenue . " <p> Mr. McQuaid 's view is that " I 'd love to be a billionaire and fund it all myself and take more time , but all I can do is make the best game I can at launch and get the message out that it is n't as polished as WOW but it also has a lot more depth and a lot more freedom . " <p> In the end he may have good cause to be upbeat . " In some ways this is just the beginning of a long journey , " Mr. McQuaid said . " People ask me , ' Are you launching a finished game ? ' And the answer is no , we 're launching a game that is good enough to launch , but it 's not finished . And that 's why I love these games : because they should never be finished . " ##
