Bette may be gone , but the star-vehicle sitcom train of 2000-01 sputters on . The always adorable Joan Cusack is betrayed by the relationship comedy Joan , which cranks up her neurotic cuteness to clinically diagnosable levels and plays a little like a live-action version of Cathy . Damon Wayans fares better as a besieged patriarch in Wife , but it too visibly strains to be a 21st century Cosby Show , less because of the bourgie African-American milieu than because of the tiredly wisecracking Huxtabilitude it shoehorns the acerbic Wayans into . <P>  --  By James Poniewozik
