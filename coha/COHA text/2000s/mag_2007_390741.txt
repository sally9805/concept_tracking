Headnote If you 're struggling to talk to God , make use of the friends who can hold you up . YEARS AGO I LISTENED TO A FRIEND SPEAK EARNESTLY about her prayer practices . She talked about the time of day at which she normally prays and the place in her home set aside for this purpose . She told me about the manner of prayer she prefers , how she got into the habit of it , what she 's learned so far over the years of regular contemplation , and how much prayer has added to the graces in her life . Then she looked at me as if to invite me to share my own experiences . " It 's not like that for me , " I stammered , embarrassed . I admitted that I find praying very hard , that I 'm sort of rotten at it , that my sorry struggles in prayer are more like mudwrestling with an ape than the exalted experiences she had been describing . My friend 's eyes went wide . Because she has a charism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that other people might not be enjoying the same experience . But evidently it occurred to Jesus that some folks will have more trouble along the spiritual path than others . He spends a lot of time in Luke 's gospel praying , talking about praying , teaching his disciples to pray , and inviting them to pray with him . When the disciples ask for more faith , he tells them they do n't need more . They just need faith . When the 10th leper returns to give thanks for the healing he received , Jesus confirms the necessity of the spirit of gratitude for true healing . Through the parable of the persistent widow , Jesus reminds us that the prayer of asking is not only valid but required as a sign of our steady confidence in God . In another parable about a Pharisee and a tax collector , Jesus says the quality of our prayer is not measured by personal virtue but by the depth of our humility before God . IN THIS MONTH OF SUNDAYS , EVEN BEGINNERS IN THE SPIRItual life can gather together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any faith is enough if it 's real . A healed heart is a grateful heart . Asking God for what we need is in itself a sign of faith . In our dealings with God , confessing sin is better than bragging about virtue . A graying amateur like me appreciates such simple guidance . I am bringing my mustard seed of faith to prayer just by showing up , no matter how reluctant , ill prepared , or distracted I am in the moment . I come to prayer because , as Peter once said plainly , " Lord , to whom shall we go ? " This is not a declaration of helplessness . Naturally I do have other avenues of recourse that I employ when appropriate . There are certain things I expect from myself : an honest effort , a bit of courage , and some clean laundry once in a while . I seek and need other things from family as well ( love , acceptance-and sometimes clean laundry ) , and friends ( time to chill out and play ) , and the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hope ) . But then there are those needs that ca n't be answered in any other way or from any other source . I ca n't do anything about cancer , natural disasters , this week 's horrifying headlines , or the pain in the face of a stranger I saw at the supermarket . Nor do I want to take to my family or friends , once again , the fear that rages like a wildfire across my life on a regular basis . Sometimes the only conversation left to have is the one between God and me . And sometimes even that requires assistance . For this reason I 've always liked the story about Moses at the battle of Amalek . Moses does n't wage the war against Amalek , mind you ; Joshua does it for him . This has to do with the delicate issue of age , perhaps . Since Moses dies at the age of 120 , and he spends 40 years wandering the desert wilderness with the Israelites , one presumes that Moses is over 80 when the fighting occurs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whippersnappers . But Moses does n't just retire to his tent as the armies engage . Instead he climbs to the top of a hill with his aging brother , Aaron , and Hur , described elsewhere as a grandfather and elder . These three fellows may not be doddering , but they are within shouting distance . Moses means to intercede for Joshua 's troops by raising the staff of God in intercession over the battlefield . But war can take a while , and even a vigorous man ca n't hold up his arms all day . While Moses keeps the staff in the air , Israel gains the advantage . But whenever Moses lowers his arms to rest , Amalek advances . This military strategy has obvious limitations . Aaron and Hur come up with an elegant solution . First they put a rock under Moses so that he can sit down . Next they place themselves on either side and support his arms . Together , the three old men do what any one of them could scarcely do himself . What a lovely image for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEAK , I DEEPLY appreciate the community of faith wherever I go . I rely on the assembly at the Sunday Eucharist and look for more intimate support groups at gatherings , both sacramental and social . I apprentice myself to spiritual giants whenever I spot them . I make use of spiritual direction , pastoral care , the lives of the saints , and good books by people who seem to be farther down the road of holiness than I am . When it comes time to pray , I recognize that I need my parish but I also engage the celestial community of saints to help me do the work of prayer . When we 've got so many sisters and brothers in Christ to support our failing arms , why not make full use of them ? Especially the saints who , consigned to eternity , certainly have the time . What else have they got to do besides participate in the burgeoning reign of God anyway ? What else would they want to do ? Maybe I 'm particularly strong on this point because I 'm frail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of those saints who wears out her knees in the chapel , or coughs through her last rosary on a bloodstained pillowcase that smells like roses . I admire that person and want to enlist her support . I 'll light a candle to get her attention while I rock back and forth for an agonizing few minutes of asking God to pardon my distraction , but I have so much to do and none of it is getting done while we 're here yammering about it . Perhaps it 's the cry of a workaholic , but I must admit the sheer physicality of Moses ' prayer is what I love the most . I ca n't bear to say long prayers , repeat looping mantras , uncross my legs and put my feet flat on the floor , or , yikes , empty myself of all thoughts whatsoever . These kinds of prayer styles make me despair of communicating with God at all . But holding up a stick-well , I can do that . Which is another way of saying , it 's something to actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " prayers : walking the Stations of the Cross , moving through a labyrinth , or making a pilgrimage to a holy place outright . I even hiked to the top of honest-to-goodness Mount Sinai once . Ascending Moses ' mountain to reach God made spiritual sense to me in a way talking prayers rarely do . This may make me a spiritual director 's worst nightmare , but these are my limitations and it 's a real poverty to be so spiritually dense . BUT WHAT WAS IT JESUS SAID ABOUT THE SPIRITUAL LIFE ? Any faith is enough , the attempt of prayer is itself an act of faith , gratitude is a good sign , and humility is the best attitude . I think I 've got the raw material here to make something of my poverty . I 'll try . But I 'm counting on you to pray forme .
