The Mountain <br> ( i ) <br> Darkness bore down on her as the car shuddered up the mountain . Distant lights danced at the edge of her vision , then vanished . Beck wondered how bad it would be . In her mind , she saw only the Jericho she had loved fifteen yeas ago and , in some ways , still did : the dashing scion of an old New England family that had provided government officials since the Revolution . One of his ancestors had a traffic circle named for him in Washington . A cousin served in the Senate . The family 's history was overwhelming ; the Jericho for whom Beck had fallen had certainly overwhelmed her . He had been brilliant , and powerful , and confident , and fun , ever ready with eternal wisdom , or clever barbs . She did not like to think of that mighty man ravaged by disease . She had no illusions . She remembered what cancer had done to her own father . <br> Whatever was waiting , she had to go . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Beck took the shuttle from Boston to Washington . She lived in Virginia , a stone 's throw from Reagan National Airport . Her daughter was at a church retreat , church being a thing that Beck did because she had been raised that way , and her mother would be offended if Rebecca dared differ . Beck decided to let Nina stay the night with the other kids . The two of them could ride together to the airport on Sunday , then enplane for their different destinations . Rebecca 's mother , Jacqueline , had been after her for weeks to send Nina for a visit , and maybe this was the time . The child was only in second grade ; missing a few days of instruction would do her no harm . Beck hesitated , then made the inevitable call to Florida , to ask if her mother could look after Nina . The conversation soon turned into a battle . <br> I do n't know how you could even think about taking a six-year-old to visit a man like that . <br> I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling you . <br> You said you decided not to take her . That means you thought about it . I do n't understand how your mind works sometimes . <br> She tried , and failed , to remember a time when she and her mother had not been at odds . Because , in the eyes of her eternally disappointed mother , Beck would never be more than ten years old . Certainly their animosity predated Jericho ; and perhaps it had played some sort of role ( as every one of the therapists Rebecca had consulted over the years seemed to think ) in her falling in love , as a college sophomore , with a married man thirty-two years her senior who tossed away his remarkable career in order to possess her . <br> I appreciate your help , Mom . <br> Oh , so you appreciate me now . Does that mean you 'll call more often ? <br> But Beck rarely called anybody . She was not the calling sort . She lived in a cookie-cutter townhouse in Alexandria , along with her daughter and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was working . Her mother had married young , and was supported by her husband until the day he died . Beck 's marriage had lasted less than two years . The thing with Jericho had ruined Rebecca for men , her mother insisted ; and maybe it was true . Her mother was full of certitudes about the errors of others , and for the next few days would fill Nina 's mind with her fevered dogmas . Hating herself , Beck had put her daughter on the plane to Florida anyway ; and Nina , cradling the cat carrier , had marched regally into the jetway , never turning her head for a final wave , because she was a lot more like her grandmother than like her mother . <br> Or maybe not . Rebecca herself had been a feisty child , curious and willful and prepared at any moment to be disobedient . She had always pretended that she was fine without her mother , perhaps because her mother spent so much time insisting on the opposite . Her rebelliousness had led her into trouble all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where a protest against the dress code had led to a suspension ; and at Princeton , where a star wide receiver tried to have his way with the reluctant freshman and wound up with a broken nose for his troubles , missing half the season . A year later , she had wound up in Jericho 's bed . Maybe Nina was not like her grandmother at all , but simply a younger version of Beck  --  a possibility too scary to contemplate . <br> ( ii ) <br> Lights on her tail . Was she being followed ? <br> A wiser woman , Beck told herself , would have dismissed such a notion as the sort of nonsense that always sneaked into her head when she thought about Jericho . In the chilly night hours on a lonely and lightless mountain road , however , when the same pair of headlights kept slipping in and out of the fog , it was easier to be fearful than wise . <br> She accelerated  --  no easy matter for the little rental car  --  and the headlights vanished . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again . <br> " How do you know they 're the same headlights ? " she sneered . <br> She just knew . She knew because the years had slipped away and she was back in Jericho 's world , a world where a canoodling couple at the next table in a restaurant at a resort in Barbados meant you were under surveillance , where the maid at the Ritz planted bugs in the bedroom , where unexpected cars in the middle of the Yucatn were packed with terrorists ready to exact revenge for your earnest defense of your country . <br> She reminded herself that Jericho 's paranoia no longer guided her life , but her foot pressed harder anyway , and the little car shuddered ahead . She shot down into the valley and passed through half a town . It began to snow . She climbed again , breasted the rise , went around a curve , and suddenly was suspended in nothing . <br> No headlights behind her , no road in front of her . <br> Then she almost drove over the cliff . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in reality , especially in the middle of the night , when you daydreamed your way into an unexpected nighttime snowstorm  --  unexpected because in Beck 's corner of the country , the worst that ever happened in April was rain . At ten thousand feet , as she was beginning to remember , the weather was different . One moment , hypnotized by the cone of her headlights as it illuminated the shadowy road ahead and the dark trees rushing by on either side , Beck was gliding along , totting up the errors of her life ; then , before she realized what was happening , heavy flakes were swirling thickly around her , and the road had vanished . <br> Rebecca slowed , then slewed , the front end mounting an unseen verge , the rear end fishtailing , but by then her winter smarts had returned , and she eased the wheel over in the direction of the skid . The car swiveled and bumped and came to rest ten yards off the road . She sat still , breath hitching . No headlights behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> " False alarm , " Beck muttered , furious at herself for having let Jericho back into her head , gleefully whispering his mad cautions . <br> She set the brake and opened the door and found , to her relief , that she was not in a ditch or a snowbank . She could back the car uphill onto the tarmac . But turning around would be easier , if there was room . Shivering as the cold leached into her fashionable boots , she squinted ahead , checking to make sure that she had room enough . The whirl of snow was slowing . She had trouble judging the distance . The beams of her headlights were swallowed up by a stand of conifers dead ahead , but there was plenty of room . Except , when she looked again , the trees were a forest , and miles away , on the other side of a steep gorge . Her toes skirted the edge . She shuffled backward . Had she tried to turn around instead of backing up , she would likely have gone over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : backing up and backing up , never taking chances . One plunge over the cliff was enough for any life . <br> Beck stood at the edge and peered into the yawning darkness . High up on the opposite slope , she could pick out what had to be the lights of Jericho 's vast house . His family wealth had purchased the property , and the scandal of their relationship had sentenced him to life imprisonment within . She had dropped out of college . He had dropped out of much more . She did the arithmetic , all the presidential ears into which he had whispered his devious advice . She remembered the year they met , the start of his indefinite sabbatical from public life , spent among the lawns of Princeton , the hushed and reverent tones in which the faculty murmured Jericho 's name . She remembered how his seminars were interrupted almost weekly by protesters branding him a war criminal ; and the relish with which he had baited his young accusers , demanding that they explain which of the regimes he was alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why . <br> Since leaving government service , Jericho had published half a dozen books on international politics , but nobody cared any more . Hardly anyone remembered who he was , or had been . Not two months ago , she had found his recent nine-hundred-page tome on the achievement of peace in the Middle East remaindered at Barnes &amp; Noble , going for three dollars and ninety-nine cents . <br> Her cell phone vibrated on her hip . Beck was surprised . Usually there was no service up here , but every now and then one found a patch of mountain digitally linked to the rest of the world . She fished the phone from her jacket . The screen said the number was unknown . When she answered , she got a blast of static in her ear , followed by a whine like a fax signal . Annoyed , she cut off the call . The phone immediately rang again , another unknown number , the same screech in her ear . No third ring . She decided to test her momentary connectedness by checking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> So how had whoever it was called her ? She walked back and forth in the clearing , but found no service anywhere . <br> Never mind . Time to get moving . Rain was falling again , big freezing drops , and she managed a smile at the absurdity . Rain , fog , snow , rain again  --  all she needed was a flood to complete a biblical weather cycle , because , in her current mood , she was ready to believe in anything . <br> The whup-whup of an approaching engine caught her ear . Another car , she thought , but then an inky form shot across her vision , and she crouched protectively until she realized that her perspective was still playing tricks : it was a helicopter , flying low but still hundreds of feet in the air . She had not realized they built them so quiet . The helicopter passed directly over her , then swooped down the valley , joining other shadows . It climbed again , reaching Jericho 's house , where the pilot seemed to hesitate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late ? Could this be the medevac chopper , preparing to rush the patient down to Denver ? Or was it perhaps carrying a VIP , come to say farewell , the trip too secret for daylight ? <br> The answer was neither . The helicopter never landed . For a long moment the pilot hovered . Another false departure , another circle . Then , evidently satisfied , the craft rose once more , returning the way it had come , and Beck found herself shutting off the headlights . An unnamable instinct warned Beck not to let whoever was aboard see her . <br> The media , she told herself firmly , climbing back into the car as the craft vanished over the hills . Television networks , compiling footage for the obituary . No question , that 's who it was . <br> And yet  --  <br> And yet , why risk a flight through the Rockies to shoot the house in the dead of night ? Atmosphere , she decided , starting the engine . They wanted to convey the sense of dread . <br> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
