In a standard Hollywood film , Dean Corso ( Johnny Depp ) would be the villain : he sports a goatee , smokes and  --  gasp !  --  reads books . Yet in the Polanski netherworld , Corso is the hero , in search of the devil 's autobiography . Before it goes both sluggish and batty , the movie offers some of the grace notes of classic thrillers . It 's handsome and elaborate , with nicely quirky turns by Depp , Frank Langella and Emmanuelle Seigner ( Mrs. P ) . Polanski , the perpetual exile , has made his most accessible film since fleeing the U.S. soon after Chinatown . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
