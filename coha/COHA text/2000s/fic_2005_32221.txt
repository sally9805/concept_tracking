Unnamed Perhaps the Lament baby knew that his parents couldnt name him . Moments after birth he displayed a cryptic smile , an ear-to-ear gape at the fuss displayed over his hospital crib as relatives argued over his Christian name . His mother , Julia Lament , particularly felt the burden . A childs name is his portal to the world . It had to be right . If people were named at the end of their lives , we wouldnt have mistakes like selfish children named Charity , and timid ones named Leo ! she declared . Julias namesake was a monstrous chieftain of a great-grandfather named Julius , a surly copper magnate of Johannesburg , South Africa , married three times , arrested for slowly poisoning his last wife through nightly glasses of milk dosed with arsenic . Even after his incarceration , the Clare family insisted on naming their children after him in a desperate attempt to win his favor and thereby keep the copper mines in the family . Hence : four Julias , two Juliuses , a couple of Julians , several Juliannas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spitefully , Uncle Julius left his fortune to a nurse in the prison hospital . Her name was Ida Wicks , and she was neither compassionate nor attentive ; in fact , she belittled her patients maladies in contrast to her own , which included poor circulation , migraines , lumbago , shingles , bunions , and tinnitus . Nevertheless , Uncle Julius appreciated seeing a woman every morning during his last days on earth , and Nurse Wicks survived her ills long enough to spend his moneya task that kept her cold heart beating a few hours beyond her one hundredth birthday . Howard Lament , loving husband to Julia and father to the nameless baby , felt a sense of urgency about giving the child a name , even if it was the wrong one . An efficient man , with a broad forehead , a waxen droop of a nose , and a swath of copper hair that curled into a question mark between his temples , Howard abhorred indecision . Ill give him my namethatll do , he said . After all , its tradition ! Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned a thing or two from Uncle Julius , not to mention having been brought up in the dusty tradition of the girls boarding school . Tradition . She sniffed . What has tradition ever done for anybody ? Oh , sighed her husband , darling , please do nt go on about that school again . Abbey Gate School for Girls was a Gothic eyesore of immense timbers , roofed with gray slate and thick , bulbous chimneys . The absurdly slender windows seemed designed primarily for defense , a hint of the architects conviction that modern girls needed to be protected from all manner of assault . Guided by sparse incandescent lighting down dark-paneled corridors , the girls walked in single file with silent footsteps . Learning at Abbey Gate was a regrettable chore requiring swift , accurate replies and a minimum of opinion . Julia , helplessly opinionated and impulsive , did not fit in . Her raven-blue hair was a tangled mesh that fought the comb and brush , and , when braided , never hung properly like the other girls . Though her peers took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege . Not a lesson passed in which her hand did nt rise in challenge , flicking her braid back and forth like a cats subversive tail . Julias nemesis was the head of classics at Abbey Gate . Mrs. Ur-quhart had the face of a spinstera myopic squint , thin , ungenerous lips , and copious facial hair . Nevertheless , her husband could be found sleeping at all the important school functions . He was a taxidermist with thickly whorled spectacles and a waist that began at his armpits . Mrs. Urquhart taught Shakespeare as a series of morality lessonschiefly about the institution of marriage . Girills , she screeched in her Glaswegian burr , girills , Lady Macbeth drove her husband to a bloodthirsty end , proving , once again , that the criticisms of a wife are best kept to herself lest her husband take them to heart and slaughter his way to the throne . . . . In a flash , the hand of Miss Julia Clare would shoot up , entwined by the recalcitrant braid , intent on an urgent and passionate rebuttal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socratic method , would cast a blind eye to the twitching braid until her pupils gasps became too insistent to ignore . What is it , Miss Clare ? Perhaps , Mrs. Urquhart , Lady Macbeth was simply fed up with listening to her husband complain about his station in life ! I can nae hear yuh , Miss Clare , speak louder next time . Mrs. Urquhart smiled , as if that settled the matter . Consider Macbeth , Mrs. Urquhart , the girl persisted . No backbone , no confidence , believing a gaggle of old biddies stirring a cauldron . I mean , what a dope of a Scotsman ! A hush of delight spread across the classroom as the girls watched their mentoress blanch ; not one day passed that she did nt wear the official green-and-black tartan of the Urquharts ( did nt she play the bagpipes for the school as a special treat on Robert Burnss birthday ? ) . Her great badgerly whiskers rose in outrage ; she removed her misty tortoiseshell glasses and drew up her massive Caledonian breast . Ere yuh presuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death , Miss Clare ? Even as she trembled before this woman , there was in Julia Clare a stubborn refusal to be intimidated by anyone . Softly , she replied , No more than you are , Mrs. Urquhart . Now the gnarled , nicotine-stained fingers of her teacher , clutching a yellowed and crusty handkerchief , stabbed the air in the direction of the door . Get oot of mah class ! With pleasure , Mrs. Urquhart . Julia Clare took the familiar route to the Office of the Head-mistress , sitting in penitence on a hard oaken bench in the foyerpunishment far worse , in fact , than any time spent with the headmistress . Mrs. Grace Bunsen , a woman unrelated to the inventor of the famous burner yet possessed of a bright flame of hair ( the color of Double Gloucester cheese , curiously similar to the hair of Julias future husband ) , by virtue of her mercy reinforced Julias belief that a Christian name is a window into ones character . Said Grace , Julia , when will you realize that some opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgive me , Mrs. Bunsen , but every word out of Mrs. Urquharts mouth is insulting to women ! With a dignified frown , Grace Bunsen would ask for the particularswhich produced considerable mirth when she conveyed them to the faculty . Julia was unaware of her fame in the teachers lounge ; its shabby armchairs and unemptied ashtrays were the hub for Julia stories while Mrs. Urquhart nursed one of her pungent Malayan cigars beneath a cedar tree on the school grounds , spitting tobacco-stained saliva at the squirrels . but what shall we name our son ? asked Howard as Julia stared at the ceiling from her hospital bed . Im busy thinking , replied Julia , though she was really thinking of Beatrice . Parenthood has , as one of its side effects , the quality of recasting all childhood experience . It was Mrs. Urquharts butchery of Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing that finally dissolved Julias veil of respect . Beatrice was Julias favorite character , sharp-spoken , skeptical of love , but , when stoked , possessed of a fiery passion ; most of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed with quick and witty retorts , a woman who always knew what to say . It wasnt as though Mrs. Bunsen had nt warned Julia ahead of time . Julia , youre certainly entitled to disagree with her , but do try to express it without insulting her heritage . She provokes me ! Shes your teacher , Julia . Further arguments could lead to your expulsion . The last thing Julia wanted was to disturb the volatile relationship between her parents . Her father , Adam Clare , a bureaucrat at the Electricity Supply Commission in Johannesburg , had never made enough money to please his wife , and couldnt wait for the weekends to go hunting or fishing . Her mother , aptly named Rose , was strikingly beautiful , prickly to the touch , a woman who had criticism for everyone , especially her daughter . The only thing worse than the disharmony at home was the prospect of being sent home to be the source of it . In the next month , Julia behaved herself while Mrs. Urquhart blamed Desdemona for Othellos bad end and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resisted the thrashing Mrs. Urquhart gave her beloved Beatrice until almost the very end . She remembered the warnings of her headmistress , and perhaps in the disapproval of Mrs. Urquhart she heard a more primal voice , the voice of Rose , who found her daughters presence so unsatisfactory that she had bundled her off to boarding school at the age of seven . The classics teacher observed her young foes reticencehands buried under her knees , mouth zipped shutso when it seemed clear that her gadfly wouldnt sting , she ended her lecture with this final remark : Youll notice how often Beatrice seeks the last word in any sceneclearly an insecure and weak young woman . A weak woman ? Beatrice ? The girls turned for the volley . Julia wiped the beads of sweat along her upper lipanother quality her mother disliked . Shes assuredly your child , Adam . See how she sweats from the most masculine parts of her body ! Mrs. Urquhart folded her armsgauntlet dropped . Waiting . Julia bit her lip so hard she could feel the blood on her tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , the faces of the girls were trained on her while the hirsute harpy gloated in triumph . Julia then , without realizing it , fixed one eye on the puckered face of her teacher and raised a skeptical eyebrow . Madam , if what you say about Shakespeare reflects life , then all men are the dupes of women , and all women are the mistresses of their destruction . What would Mr. Urquhart say to that , I wonder ? Heads were lowered to desks , as if to avoid the return fire from this verbal torpedo . Mrs. Urquhart squinted , regarding the mock innocence of her assailant with a bobbing craw . Miss Clareyoull nae sit in my class eer again ! she sputtered . Julia was found by her father at the train station , in her uniform , a blue-and-gray tartan , a wide straw hat , and white kneesocks . Perched on a large trunk , she cradled her dog-eared copy of Lambs Tales from Shakespeare . Well , missy , he said . What a mess were in now . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , thick eyebrows , and strong cheekbones . She liked to imagine a more savage version of him slaughtering Hadrians legions in the heather . Im so sorry , Papa , she replied . He deflected her apology with a soft shrug . Hows Mummy ? Tell me all the news . Do I look taller ? Her father hesitated . Yes , missy , I think you might be as tall as your mother . You must measure us together . Where is she ? Adam Clare dug into his jacket pockets , nervously looking for his pipe , then , sighing , he dropped his shoulders and looked at Julia with an abashed smile . The thing is , missy , your mother and I are divorced . The sun broke through the fever trees , and Julia tried to shield the harsh light from her eyes with both hands . What ? she said , hoping she had misheard , and yet knowing she had nt . Our marriage is over . When ? Oh , last Christmas , actually . Her father swallowed . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but . . . well , here you are . Here she was . A loose end to the marriage . An attached string somebody had forgotten to clip . What will I do ? she asked . Well , luckily theyve accepted you at Saint Marys . He smiled . Youll continue your studies , grow up , and have a wonderful life . Julia was sure that Beatrice would have summoned the right riposte , but she couldnt imagine what it was . By the time her outrage found words , her father was busy negotiating with a porter for the shipment of her trunk to the new school . Then he offered her an ice cream and Julia heard herself thanking him for the treat through hot tears . It just does nt seem right to name a child after oneself , Julia told Howard as she looked at her new baby boy , when he may not feel kindly toward you later in life . What could he possibly have against me ? Im certainly not going to make my fathers mistakes . Howard laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one mistakemarrying each other . Though the Lament babys eyes were closed , the power of his smile was astounding . If ever a child possessed a confident spirit , this one excelled in that regard . No parent could doubt that this baby , in spite of his lack of a name , was destined for a happy life .
