Section : Reviews &; Responses Response The United States Versus Japan The FCC 's Real Wrongs <p> Like monetary policy and antitrust regulation , telecommunications policy is a major driver of economic growth rarely debated in public . During the last presidential campaign , for example , issues related to the United States ' technological leadership were either marginalized or ignored altogether . By highlighting the importance of this overlooked topic , Thomas Bleha ( " Down to the Wire , " May/June 2005 ) performs an important public service . Unfortunately , in criticizing Washington 's approach to the issue , he misidentifies the challenge and offers a problematic solution . TOKYO STORY <p> The essence of Bleha 's argument is that under President George W. Bush , the United States dropped " the Internet leadership baton , " allowing Japan to " pick it up " and guide broadband innovation . Bleha cites Japan 's progress in spurring high-speed Internet access connections via both wires ( using digital subscriber line DSL and fiber-optic technology ) and wireless spectrum . He predicts that Japan and other technology-savvy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits of the broadband era " while the United States will be left behind . <p> It is beyond dispute that Japan has succeeded wildly in stimulating the rollout of DSL connections . Japan 's recent regulatory policies , along with the entrepreneurial gusto of the venture-capital firm Softbank ( which underwrote the investments made by Yahoo ! BB ) , have brought faster , cheaper , and more innovative broadband services . The number Of DSL connections in Japan surged from 100,000 in 2001 to more than 9 million just three years later , with the established providers offering only 40 percent of these . Regardless of whether this success owes more to government regulations or to Softbank 's risky investments , Japan 's experience is worth examining . <p> Bleha argues that the day of reckoning will come for Washington , not only because Japan 's success has eclipsed U.S. progress but also because of what he describes as U.S. policy failures . Unfortunately , he misstates the record . Bleha blames Michael Powell , the former chair of the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage broadband deployment by requiring that all broadband networks be shared with competitors . Under Powell , the FCC did exempt telephone companies from having to share newly built fiber-optic connections with rivals , but it did so to encourage companies to invest the billions of dollars necessary to lay down the expensive cables in the first place . Bleha , moreover , over- looks the fact that to promote competition , Powell did support the Japanese model and a " line-sharing " policy that would have given new providers access to existing copper wires . Unfortunately , as part of a compromise designed to guarantee access to existing voice telephone networks , a majority of the FCC rejected Powell 's position , making a policy mess . Contrary to Bleha 's criticism of Powell , Washington failed to follow the Japanese model because it focused on the old voice network , not because Powell lacked the vision necessary to promote DSL competition . OUT OF COMMISSION <p> As Bleha correctly notes , U.S. broadband policy focuses on encouraging platform rivalry , with DSL and cable modem providers taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from wireless services such as next-generation mobile phones or fixed wireless technologies such as WiMax . According to Bleha , the Powell FCC failed to facilitate the rollout of such technologies ; instead , he charges , the FCC " only tinkered with spectrum policy around the edges . " <p> Once again , his indictment misses the mark . The current FCC is not to blame for the lack of spectrum available for wireless broadband ; U.S. broadband policy is hamstrung by a series of protectionist decisions that Congress and earlier commissions made years ago to govern the transition from analog to digital television . These decisions , intended to protect U.S. television manufacturers from Japanese competition , dedicated large swaths of spectrum to television broadcasters , which now reach only approximately 15 percent of their viewers " over the air " ( as opposed to via satellite or cable connections ) . <p> The challenges of reforming U.S. spectrum policy appear lost on Bleha . For starters , the United States remains committed to simultaneously broadcasting television shows in both the analog and digital formats , which requires reserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worse , broadcasters can not sell or lease to wireless broadband providers the spectrum they currently use , for example , for UHF stations . In other words , it is the rigid requirements ( most mandated by Congress ) restricting the use and transfer of spectrum that are stifling wireless broadband development today . If anything , the FCC deserves credit for taking , despite these conditions , a number of very important steps , including promoting secondary markets for spectrum , spurring the use of spectrum on an unlicensed basis for technologies such as WiMax , and calling for other innovative spectrum policy reforms , such as those designed to take advantage of software-defined radio technology . CROSSED SIGNALS <p> Bleha 's most troubling argument is his claim that the U.S. government should support certain technologies as part of its economic development strategy . To appreciate how risky the proposal is , consider the rise of advanced television and advanced mobile-phone service , both of which prompted regulatory strategies of the kind Bleha champions  --  and both of which ultimately backfired . <p> It was the threat of Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital television that the United States still follows today . Washington committed wide swaths of spectrum to digital television , leaving U.S. mobile-phone providers with less bandwidth than they needed and only about half the amount of their European counterparts . The entire effort assumed that Americans would continue to watch television shows broadcast over the air . Yet over the past two decades , more U.S. consumers have begun to watch cable and satellite television , undermining the rationale for this expensive policy , which has also delayed innovation and imposed unjustifiable costs on the nation . <p> Meanwhile , the European regulatory authority decided that the advent of digital , second-generation cell phones required governments to promote the technology known as the global system for mobile communications , or GSM , to ensure a compatible system throughout Europe . Wisely , the United States refused to favor any given technology and instead allowed marketplace experimentation to guide development . That strategy yielded the superior code division multiple access ( CDMA ) technology developed by the California company Qualcomm , which uses spectrum more efficiently . The transition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on CDMA technology ) will be much smoother for those U.S. companies that have adopted CDMA , such as Verizon Wireless and Sprint PCS , than for their European counterparts . <p> Bleha also urges Washington to commit to supporting the installation of ultra-high-speed fiber connections to one-third of U.S. households by 2010 . But his proposal may be foolhardy : even though fiber appears to be a promising technology today , such technologies have failed in the past for a variety of reasons , leaving investors with little to show for their money . ( Remember digital audio tape recorders ? ) The U.S. government should be leery of endorsing particular technologies  --  or even certain transmission speeds  --  before it knows more about them and whether the market can support them . SAFE AND SOUND <p> Bleha correctly identifies an important and often overlooked concern : the critical role of technological development in the economy . The Bush administration has done too little to promote broadband development and adoption . But even though it should do more to support the migration to digital broadband technologies , the government should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should educate consumers about the opportunities that broadband presents and facilitate the development of new technologies ( such as WiMax and software-defined radio ) by reforming spectrum policy and funding basic research . Some government support may ultimately be necessary to help drive broadband , but the government should not rush to judge where , when , and how to support a particular technology . After all , Americans are adopting broadband faster than they have adopted almost any other technology in history . About 80 percent of Americans connected to the Internet already enjoy broadband access at work , and more subscribe to broadband services than to narrowband at home . Last year , the number of U.S. consumers and businesses adopting broadband jumped by 34 percent , to about 38 million lines . <p> To be sure , some aspects of U.S. regulatory policy are antiquated , and they may not be updated soon enough . The Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not even address the development of broadband Although the FCC is working to create a regulatory framework that would promote technological innovation , it remains to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also trying to encourage flexibility and dynamism in spectrum policy , but its hands are tied by congressional decisions that , among other things , continue to support broadcast television that few Americans watch . <p> Over the next few years , Congress will revisit the decisions it made in 1996 . To the extent that Bleha 's argument spurs thoughtful deliberation and an appreciation for the significance of broadband technology , it will serve U.S. policymakers well . Unfortunately , it could just as well spark efforts , much like the sponsorship of digital television in the late 1980s and early 1990s , that could prove counterproductive . Bleha Replies <p> Philip Weiser and I agree on some basic matters . We both believe that broadband and wireless policies are important . We agree that these technologies can drive economic growth . We both think the Bush administration has done too little to promote broadband in the United States . And we agree that spectrum policy needs reform . Weiser did not address my central conclusion that Japan and its Asian neighbors will lead the broadband era and be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may agree about that as well . <p> Still , we have significant differences . We assess the FCC 'S record under Powell differently . As Weiser states , Powell did favor , although secondarily , promoting DSL competition . But it was Powell 's failure to convince a majority of his fellow commissioners to go along with him that left the country with what Weiser calls ( and I agree ) " a policy mess . " The mess was made worse by the Bush administration 's refusal to appeal a court case that might have preserved some DSL competition . It was made still worse by a recent Supreme Court decision ( in the case National Cable and Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services ) that ruled out competitive access to residential , cable television lines . <p> As for spectrum policy , Weiser credits the FCC for promoting ( modest ) secondary markets , spurring the use of unlicensed spectrum for new technologies , and other less important reforms . To my mind , these policies amount to minor tinkering . I agree that the Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other commissioners and that the challenges of reforming spectrum policy are formidable . But a presidential task force called for spectrum reform more than a year ago ; it is past time for the government to take action . The Bush administration has shown that when it wants to , it can take momentous steps . <p> Weiser and I also disagree about the nature of the challenge the United States now faces . Weiser is far less concerned about how slow , expensive , and unreliable the basic broadband service currently available to American households ( 1  --  3 megabits per second ) is . If I am right , four large new markets for Internet applications , products , services , and content will develop in the foreseeable future . These markets  --  for high-speed broadband ( 10-50megabits per second ) , ultra-high-speed broadband ( up to 100 megabits per second ) , third-generation mobile videophones , and fourth-generation mobile broadband phones  --  will emerge in countries where there are about ten million subscribers to each of these services . Markets for high-speed broadband and third-generation mobile phones already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadband is in the offing . The emergence of these markets is years away in the United States , however , because political leadership and a national strategy to promote them are lacking . Unless the United States adopts a new approach , it will forfeit the innovation , new jobs , international competitiveness , economic growth , and improved living conditions that come with these new markets . <p> Weiser warns against government support for a particular technology . Although this generally is a wise rule , I believe that deploying a fiber infrastructure should be an exception to it . New wireless technologies are only as fast as their link to the Internet . There are now thousands of WiFi hotspots capable of sustaining data transfer at 11 megabits per second and more that deliver only 1 megabit or so because they are limited by the capacity of the DSL line serving them . The same applies to WiMax . Creating new fiber connections would eliminate these constraints . Wired connections , preferably fiber , are also needed to handle long-distance mobile-phone services . Fiber , moreover , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly interactive : to upload as well as download data at ultrahigh speeds . But this is not to rule out other complementary technologies . The fiber infrastructure need not be brought directly to the premises . Population density might determine whether fiber is brought all the way to households and businesses , the curb , the neighborhood , or the region . <p> There are several ways to develop a fiber infrastructure , but most of them require significant government involvement to ease restrictions , create competitive conditions for new markets , and give tax incentives and even subsidies to companies that deploy it . I agree with Weiser that supporting a fiber infrastructure would involve some risk . But maintaining the present course is also risky : without government support , fiber rollout is likely to be slow and entail considerable duplication , and it is unlikely to reach rural and poor areas . <p> The government will also have to confront another fiber-related issue . The FCC 's decision to exempt telephone companies from sharing their fiber networks has postponed consideration of what applications , products , services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should Verizon or Comcast , for example , control all of the content on their fiber network ? Is it reasonable to expect a family to subscribe to two or three networks so it can have access to the services and content it wants ? <p> This brings me to a more profound difference : Weiser and I disagree on the extent of government involvement that is desirable . Weiser would limit the government 's role to educating consumers about the benefits of broadband , reforming spectrum policy , funding basic research , and perhaps down the road modestly supporting broadband deployment . I believe the United States needs top-level political leadership , a national broadband strategy with bold deployment goals , and strongly competitive broadband markets now . Until the government moves decisively in this direction , the United States will continue to slide in global broadband rankings  --  with unfortunate economic and social consequences . ( The International Telecommunication Union recently announced that as of December 2004 , the United States had slipped again , from 13th place to 16th place , in rankings of broadband usage worldwide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 . The new FCC chair , Kevin Martin , says this goal is his top priority . Now the United States needs top-level political leadership to inject a sense of urgency into reaching these fine objectives . <p> By Philip J. Weiser <p> <p> Philip J.
