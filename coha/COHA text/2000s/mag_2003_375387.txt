Demetrios Coupounas , an avid outdoorsman and entrepreneur , dreamed of tapping into the money spigot known as the Pentagon . But until last year he had come up parched . A co-founder of GoLite  --  a privately held outdoor-gear firm based in Boulder , Colo.  --  Coupounas tried to sell military purchasers on his company 's lightweight tents , backpacks and sweat-wicking T shirts . But even after calling evaluators at the Army 's gear-testing center in Natick , Mass. , meeting with sales reps who hawk wares to the military and calling Navy SEAL officers directly , he had booked just a handful of individual sales to a fighter here and there . <P> Shortly after the war in Afghanistan , however , Coupounas set up a booth at an outdoor-gear trade show in Anaheim , Calif. , and to his surprise , some of the same military buyers who had rebuffed him for years came clamoring for his goods . He started selling small batches of GoLite undergarments to special-forces units . Today he says he has a thriving military business , accounting for 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't actively design for the military , " says Coupounas , 37 , who climbs 14,000-ft. mountains to personally test his firm 's new products . " They just happen to like our stuff . " <P> With the military under orders to get lighter and faster , several companies that make gear for outdoor-adventure athletes are booking sales to special-forces units assigned everywhere from Afghanistan 's Tora Bora mountains to the Philippine jungles . " Private companies are leading in the R. and D. of this stuff , " says Colonel Tom Blume , director of procurement for U.S. Special Operations Command ( SOCOM ) in Tampa , Fla . " We love off-the-shelf items because we do n't have to put R. and D. into them . " <P> The core customers for extreme-sports gear  --  climbers , adventure racers , trekkers , mountain bikers  --  torture their clothing and equipment and constantly tell firms how to improve it , demanding tighter seams , tougher fibers , better fit and lighter weight . As the gear has improved , the commandos have latched on . The North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition tents in the hope of making more military sales . In every other way , says Jill Pagliaro , a spokeswoman for North Face , " the design for Alpine athletes and military usage is similar . " <P> Unlike giant defense contractors , many extreme-sports-gear companies are privately held and ca n't afford to hire Washington lobbyists or navigate the thickets of red tape involved in bidding for government contracts . Instead , they 're getting their gear into military exchanges and booking sales to individual troops who want the equipment and pay for it out of their pockets . Army soldiers and Marines , for instance , are allowed to buy a handheld global positioning system , or GPS , unit ( shown above ) or sweat-wicking T shirts to wear under their fatigues .
