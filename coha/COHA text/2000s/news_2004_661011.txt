<p> Maybe it was because he was younger than the other seventh-graders . Maybe it was the President 's Award he got for straight A 's . Whatever the reasons , he endured a daily barrage of stomach punches , neck-jabs , and ear-twists from an older tormentor . His grades fell , he became withdrawn , and , according to his mother , he just grunted when she asked him how school was going . <p> Betty Tom Davidson asked the Orange County , N.C. , school system to pull her son out of class . But the school cited academic reasons for him to stay . So Ms. Davidson resigned from the school board last month , saying it was futile to try to work within a system that seemed to protect bullies . " He ca n't learn anything if he 's scared to death , " she says . " Complacency is unacceptable . " <p> Five years after social outcasts made tragic history at Colorado 's Columbine High School , experts say bullying remains a schoolyard constant - and may even be growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with measures from anti- bullying assemblies to armed guards at schoolhouse doors , there are growing questions about whether such tactics really prevent bullying or ease students ' fear . Those doubts , along with a rising awareness of school violence , are stoking a national debate over how deeply adults should get involved in playground politics . <p> In fact , some experts cite an explosion of bullying that might leave even Bart Simpson cowering in a high school bathroom : In one Kansas school , according to a recent study by Jim Snyder , a psychologist at Wichita State University , kindergartners bully each other once every six minutes . <p> Bullying " may be particularly problematic in American schools , " says Jaana Juvonen , a psychologist at the University of California , Los Angeles , who studies school culture . " The victims of bullying , unlike the bullies , are clearly suffering and , unfortunately they 're suffering in silence . " <p> Shame and a ' code of silence ' <p> Experts estimate there are about 3.7 million bullies - defined as children who regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenth-grades ; and some research suggests that up to 20 percent of their victims suffer long-term effects , from falling grades to suicidal thoughts to violence . Two-thirds of school shooters in the past 15 years saw themselves as bullied , according to a 2002 study by the Secret Service . And bullies themselves often get in trouble with the law . <p> Even adolescent bystanders can feel a mix of shame and impotence ( having its own repercussions , both on the playground and down the road ) . <p> " All kids are exposed to bullying , and most kids figure out how to deal with it , " says Dr. Snyder . " But for chronic victims and bullies , there 's a broad impact on their social behavior , affect , and ability to make friends . " <p> Though kids ' " code of silence " can make it difficult for states to track incidents , some say the situation is getting worse . Public schools ' competition against both private schools and the voucher system may make it less palatable to report violence and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cavernous hallways and winding stairwells of large school buildings , loners may be all the more vulnerable to the reign of " hallway justice . " A decades ' long focus on self-esteem may have given some kids too much pride , making them more forceful with others . And psychologists suggest the focus on kids ' confidence may mean a subsequent lag in mediation and negotiation skills - knowledge that could defuse volatile situations . <p> According to student rankings , says Dr. Juvonen , US schools are roughly on par with those in the Czech Republic as the least friendly in the Western world . <p> Confounding the issue is that many American adults consider bullying the natural order of childhood - a first , instructive taste of the dog-eat-dog world . Moreover , teachers , worried that they 'll make the situation worse , often seem reluctant to step in : According to the Juvonen study , they now intervene only about 10 percent of the time . <p> Behind a failure to intervene <p> Despite all the antibullying assemblies starring characters like the infamous " Scary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to their own devices . <p> Certainly , a realization of one 's own power to fend off a bully can be empowering . But such strategies do n't always work - and can even backfire , precipitating violence instead of containing it . In Atlanta , a 13-year-old was charged with lashing out at a tormentor and injuring his eye with a pencil . <p> In other cases , students have gone outside their own districts to get relief - and , increasingly , they 're going to court . Last Thursday , a teen in Tonganoxie , Kan. , sued his district for failing to protect him from three years of bullying - an ordeal that finally led him to quit high school and earn a GED instead . The family says it wants to force the district to act in future cases so that other kids do n't end up in the same boat . <p> Behind the persistent bullying , some see deeper cultural forces at work : a society that condones , even supports , rudeness as a means to get ahead - not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerks get perks , " read a recent newspaper headline . ) <p> Indeed , new studies - including one authored , in part , by Juvonen and published in the journal Pediatrics - suggest bullies are often the popular kids , protected not just by students , but by teachers and administrators eager to promote " superstars . " <p> " Classmates are not keen to affiliate with a bully , but they recognize that these people have social capital and power , " says Juvonen . <p> For many educators , getting to the bottom of bullying incidents is difficult and frustrating ; and parents can unwittingly play a role . The Orange County boy , for example , had already skipped two grades . And though such promotions may seem like a good idea for high-achievers , they can cause their own problems - especially when students reach the notoriously geeky middle school years . <p> " The programs that look to be effective take the whole-school approach , that everybody from the principal to the school bus driver not only gets involved , but is trained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Ellen deLara , a Syracuse University sociologist and the author of " And Words Can Hurt Forever . " <p> " We used to think teachers stood in the hallway , " she continues , " but now that does n't really happen , because teachers are so stressed about what they need to accomplish in the classroom . It leaves kids a lot of time when students are on their own . " <p> New laws on ' school climate ' <p> Some states are trying to formalize more adult oversight of lunchrooms and playgrounds . In Oregon , school districts are debating the rights of bullies and their victims . Lousiana and Florida lawmakers toughened antibullying legislation last month . Delaware has hired a " school climate " director and , this year , launched a reporting process for bully behavior . Last week , New York City Schools passed the " Dignity in All Schools Act " to get more accurate reporting about the problem . <p> " For too many students , the daily challenge is not a challenge of study , but of survival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main sponsor of the bill . " For too long , the adult establishment has allowed this problem to continue and fester . " <p> Even here in Orange County , the school board last week passed a first reading of a new anti-bullying measure . School officials here acknowledge now that they may have acted too slowly in the Davidson case . <p> The victim 's mother says her son 's deterioration and her own resignation should serve as a reminder to other school officials - especially principals - about the importance of collaring lunchroom loudmouths and hallway arm-twisters . <p> " There are all sorts of reasons for tuning into this problem , because ultimately we will pay for it in some fashion if we do n't , " she says . " It 's just the right thing to do : If a kid reaches out for help , we have to try to reach back . " <p> * Adam Parker contributed to this report from New York . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
