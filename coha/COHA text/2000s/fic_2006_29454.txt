Chapter One I am writing this as fast as I can . I am galloping through hostile territory like the Pony Express , because I absolutely must deliver the mail . I 've already taken my fair share of arrows . And though I 'm clearly wounded , I 'm not dead . Not yet . I 'm trying mightily to remember everything germane . I 'm a bit shaky on the timeline , on the cause and effects . On specificity . I am freely and honestly admitting to this . Just so when all the little editors begin flourishing their red pencils , and they will , I 'll have hopefully , if only momentarily , dulled the momentum of their onrushing venom . I do n't blame them . I truly do n't . I am , after all , the boy who cried wolf . Who shouted , screamed , and plastered it across two-inch headlines . Mea culpa .

Writing my last story , I ca n't help but remember my first . I was 9 . It was snowing . Not the paltry dusting that generally passed for snow in Queens , New York . No , thesky was actually dumping snow , as if someone had loosened a giant saltshaker top up there . Icicles were being blown off our sagging gutters and straight into the brick walls of the house , where they splintered with the sound of ball meeting bat . Schools would be closed all week . My brother Jimmy slipped on the ice and he hit his head , I wrote on neatly lined composition paper . He is always falling down and stuff like that . He walked into a door and he got a black eye . Last week he fell down in the tub , and he burnt himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to watch where he 's going , but he do n't listen . He is only 6 . I brought the story into the kitchen where my mother was slumped over the table , staring into an empty bottle of Johnnie Walker . " Read it to me , " she slurred . After I finished , she said : " Okay , good . I want you to memorize it . They 'll be here in an hour . " ( Continues ... )
