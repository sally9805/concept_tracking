/Jan 2000 Anyone who uses the expression " smooth as a baby 's bottom " clearly has little experience with that often sore-looking skin sitting inside diapers . Fortunately , diaper rash and other minor irritations that plague children 's skin can be easily remediated . Here 's help for five of the most common conditions . Bottom Lined Whether you use cloth or disposable diapers , at some point your little one will probably suffer a bout of diaper rash . The most common culprit is irritation from wetness next to your baby 's sensitive skin . But rashes can occur for other reasons . The same organism that causes vaginal yeast infections can also cause a fungal diaper infection . " I knew it was n't a regular diaper rash , " says Toronto 's Jennielea McLeish , mom to Allegra , seven months . " The rash lasted days , and the area was really red and sore looking . " Prescription fungal creams can quickly clear up such infections . If your baby develops what appears to be pimples or pustules in the diaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) bacteria . This type of skin infection is usually treated with antibacterial soap and cream . Prevention is key when it comes to diaper rash . Change your child frequently , making sure to keep a barrier between the stool or urine and your baby 's skin . " Put petroleum jelly on all of the areas under the diaper  --  in the creases of the groin and around the genitalia and anus , " says Montreal paediatrician Denis Leduc . If you notice redness , apply a zinc oxide cream . The higher the percentage of zinc oxide , the greater the protective barrier . And as often as you can , let your baby go buck naked . Worry Warts When nine-year-old Alvin Bartolome first noticed a couple of little bumps on his hand and knee , his mother , Adora , did n't give them much thought . " They were just tiny things , " says the Vancouver mom . " I thought they 'd disappear on their own . " She was right . " If you do nothing , warts will eventually go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere from a month to a year . " If you ca n't wait that long , there are plenty of ways to treat the beastly little bumps . But before breaking out the OTC wart removers , see your doctor to confirm that it is indeed a harmless growth . Common in kids , warts are caused by a virus that gets embedded in the skin and forms a marked callous around itself . Warts usually appear on the limbs , particularly the hands and feet , and are harmless . The only ones that typically cause pain are those that grow on a pressure point , such as plantar 's warts on the feet . There are two main types of over-the-counter treatments available : liquid removers and pads . With liquids , you simply drip the solution onto the wart . If you 've got a little squirmer , pad removers are a good choice because they adhere to the skin like a small bandage . Both types contain salicylic acid , which destroys the wart over time . Liquid nitrogen is another option . When Alvin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the treatment his mother chose . Administered by a doctor , the substance 's extremely cold temperature of - 196Symbol Not TranscribedC freezes the wart to death . While liquid nitrogen often requires several treatments and can be painful , Bartolome says it worked quickly for Alvin . " They were gone in a matter of days after his initial treatment . " Finally , laser therapy is the latest weapon in the war against warts . But , says Leduc , it 's used only for very resistant or multiple warts . Cluster Busters If you think the chilly weather puts impetigo on ice , do n't be fooled : Primarily a summer bacterial skin infection , it can still appear in the winter when runny , sore noses leave skin raw , broken and vulnerable . " Impetigo is often irritating , so you 'll touch or scratch it , " explains Leduc . " When you take your hand away and put it somewhere else  --  particularly around your face or nose  --  it can spread . " Impetigo is characterized by a cluster of blisters or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up around the nose , mouth and other uncovered areas of skin . While a large outbreak requires oral antibiotics , small areas can be treated with prescription topical antibiotics . Some over-the-counter topical antibiotics can also be effective . Impetigo is contagious , but your child is more likely to spread it to other parts of his body than he is to pass it to others . Still , the Canadian Paediatric Society advises keeping him home at least one full day after beginning treatment to minimize the risk . You can treat impetigo symptoms  --  such as itching  --  much the same way you 'd treat chickenpox : with tepid baking soda or oatmeal baths . Keep the affected area clean , and wash with an antibacterial soap once a day for a few days . Easing Eczema " When I first heard the doctor use the word eczema , I panicked , " says Vancouver 's Marion Gottschlag , mom of Skyler , 6 1/2 . Bernice Krafchik , a paediatric dermatologist at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto , admits it can cause sleepless nights for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " and very unaesthetic . " There 's no known cause or cure for eczema , but it 's usually associated with dry skin . It can begin , as it did with Skyler , as itchy , small red or pink patches . A rash develops which may appear as inflamed patches , or as moist and oozing areas that crust over . Like most kids who develop eczema , Skyler had his initial bout before his first birthday . Although it can appear anywhere on the skin , in infants it usually shows up on the face and lower legs . On older children , it 's often found in elbow creases , the backs of knees , ankles and buttock creases . Many children who suffer from eczema come from families with allergies , such as hayfever . And a child is more likely to develop eczema if one of his parents has had it . Outbreaks can be triggered by a number of everyday factors : soaps ; perfumes ; certain fabrics , such as wool ; and occasionally foods , such as eggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your doctor can help identify your child 's individual triggers and suggest ways to reduce exposure to them . One of the best treatments is aggressive moisturizing , even when the skin is rash-free , says Krafchik . When bathing your child , Krafchik advises adding an emulsifying oil to the water . After the bath , leave a film of moisture on the skin and , if necessary , apply a topical steroid such as cortisone . " Parents are always afraid of using topical steroids , but if you use them appropriately they 're a very effective treatment , " says Krafchik . Follow up with an emollient . In the winter , Krafchik recommends a heavier moisturizer such as petroleum jelly . In the summer , opt for a lighter lotion . Hive Alive When Matthew Gradiski suddenly developed itchy red bumps on his lower abdomen , his mother , Vesna , suspected hives . " I thought maybe he was having an allergic reaction to something he had eaten , " says the Woodbridge , Ontario morn of two . Later , Matthew 's doctor confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibiotics the five-year-old had been taking to treat an ear infection . Figuring out why hives develop generally is n't so easy . " We ca n't find a cause for about 85 percent of cases , " says Leduc . They may be a reaction to certain foods , such as nuts , fish , eggs and soy products . Drug allergies and insect bites are also common sources . The rash can appear all over the body or in one area , and can last from minutes to several weeks . While you do n't have to lug your child to the doctor for a few that vanish as quickly as they come , hives can sometimes be a sign that your child is having a severe allergic reaction . If they are accompanied by swelling of the feet , hands , face and lips , or your child has difficulty swallowing , seek emergency medical help immediately . Minor hives usually require minimal to no treatment . Applying topical creams like calamine lotion wo n't hurt your child 's skin , but chances are , says Leduc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are itchy , antihistamines may help . A cool bath can also soothe the skin . Cold-weather Skin Care It may look like a winter wonderland outside , but when the temperature plummets and the indoor heating kicks in , skin can quickly become red , raw and chapped . Here 's how to winterize your child 's skin-care regimen : - Put harsh soaps into hibernation . Instead look for gentle cleansers that wo n't irritate already dry skin . - Keep the bath water warm , but not too warm . Hot water leaches moisture out of the skin . So bathe only when necessary and follow up with a heavy moisturizer. - Apply lip balm to little lips frequently . Encourage your kids not to lick their lips , since that will dry them out further . - Even when it 's - 15Symbol Not TranscribedC , do n't forget to apply a sunscreen to your child 's skin : Snow and ice reflect harmful UV rays . <p>
