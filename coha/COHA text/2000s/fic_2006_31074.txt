The Rising Tide By Jeff Shaara Random House Jeff Shaara 1 . THE DESERT RAT The Libyan Desert May 27 , 1942 They huddled in the chill , encased in hard steel , waiting , energized by rumors . Behind them , to the east , the black horizon was visible , silhouetted by the first glow of sunrise . The wireless radio was chattering , the voices of nervous officers far behind the line , the men in tents , who pored over maps , unsure , powerless to do anything about an enemy who might be anywhere at all . They had climbed into the tank at the first sign of daylight , each of the four men finding his place , their commander perched higher than the rest , settling into his seat just beneath the hatch of the turret . It was still too dark in the west , and the narrow view through the prism of the periscope was too confining , and so he stood , his head and shoulders outside the hatch . The long , thin barrel of the two-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy was thought to be . He stared until his eyes watered , tried to see the horizon . But it would not be there , not yet , not until the sun had given them enough light to distinguish dull , flat ground from the empty sky . The air was sharp and cold , but that would not last . Once the sun rose , the heat would come again , and the infantry , a mass of men waiting far behind their armor wall , would seek whatever shelter they had , waking the insects and the scorpions and the snakes . The tank was as good a shelter as aman had in the desert , but there was a price for shade . The thick steel made a perfect oven , and the men would man their posts and glance instinctively toward the hatches , hoping for the faintest wisp of breeze . He blinked , wiped his eyes with a dirty hand , annoyed at the crackling intrusion from the wireless . " Turn that off ! " " Sir , ca n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He ignored the young man 's protest , stared out again . The sun would quickly rise , nothing to block the light , no mountains , no trees , no rolling terrain . In a few short minutes he could see flecks of detail , an uneven field pockmarked by small rocks . There was a shadow , right in front of him , beneath the barrel of the two-pounder . It was his , of course , the low , hulking form of the tank . It makes us a target , he thought . But , then , the Germans are in the west , will have to attack straight into the rising sun . We 'll be able to see them first , certainly . Stupid tactic . But what is n't stupid out here ? Sitting in a fat tin can , armed with a two-pound pop gun , hoping like hell we see him before he sees us . There was a loud squawk from the wireless . " Dammit , at least turn that thing down ! " " Sir , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " Digby . He stared at the horizon , clear , distinct , thought of the officer who sat sucking on that idiotic pipe . His tank smells like a Turkish whorehouse . And he 's upset . Good . Bloody fool . Carries fat rolls of maps so he can find his way . In a place with no landmarks , no signposts . Stuffs the damned maps into his ammo holders , and so , he runs out of ammo . Begs the rest of us for help . Just look at the sun , Captain . All the signpost you need . The radio squawked again , and he heard the voice now . Yep . Digby . " Rec report . . . enemy in motion . . . zzzzzzzzz . . . two hundred . . . zzzzzzzz . " The wireless seemed to go dead , and he looked to the north , could see the British tanks in a ragged line . The crews had climbed into their vehicles , and most of the tank commanders were standing up , searching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north , thought , yep , there 's Digby . The sixth tank over . Brew yourself a cup of tea , Captain . There 's nothing out here but us Rats . He glanced down through the hatch , could see little , the tank dark . He knew each man well , more experienced than most , but so very young . They were better than the tank they pushed , the A9 . She was fast , maybe faster than anything the Germans had , could maneuver easily over the rocky ground , spin around like a top . In training they had been told that the two-pounder was an effective antitank weapon , firing a solid-steel projectile , supposed to pierce anything the enemy had . It had certainly worked against the Italians , who had come at them with machines that were worn-out in 1918 . The armor battles had been one-sided affairs , British tanks and artillery decimating the primitive weapons of their enemy . He remembered the first Italian tanks that had actually put up a good fight , something called an M13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too light , padded by a sad pile of sandbags around the turret . He could see it in his mind , the direct hit on an M13 that made it seem like an exploding sack of flour . And no one inside survived , ever . Bloody awful , that one . Target practice . Brave men sent to die in broken-down toys . But then the Germans came , and they brought the real thing , heavier , faster tanks , bigger guns , and suddenly the A9 crews were no longer as fond of their machines . There was something else the Germans had , a particular genius for weaponry . They had an eighty-eight millimeter antiaircraft cannon , long barrel , that threw a shell high enough to churn any pilot 's guts . But the Germans figured out that lowering the barrel and pointing it horizontally made for an antitank weapon like no other . Most of the larger artillery on both sides was like the basic howitzers , firing their shells in an arc . You could hear them coming and might even have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dive into a slit trench . But the long barrel of the eighty-eight blew a shell right through you in a straight line . No high-screaming wail , no warning . And there was n't a single British machine that the eighty-eight would n't blow to pieces . He lowered himself into the hatch , tried to see the wireless operator , Batchelor , the man who doubled as the gun loader . " Batch . Did Digby say anything else ? " " I 'm trying to raise him , sir . He said something about the rec , then I lost him . " He pulled himself up , stared out again , mulled over the word : rec . Reconnaissance . Hell of a job , flitting all over the place in light armored cars . They run right up to the Jerries , see what 's what , then run like hell to get away . Nothing but machine guns for protection . Ballsy chaps , those fellows . Below the gun barrel in front of him , a small hatch opened , and a head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's warming up a bit , sir . " Simmons was the youngest man in the crew , with bad skin and an unfortunate natural odor that even soap could not seem to cure . But there was no soap here , barely enough water to keep a man alive , and so Simmons had become just one more tank crewman who had to be accepted by his own , regardless of whatever unpleasant personal traits he might bring to the confined space . By now , they all smelled bad enough to offend anyone but themselves . Like Captain Digby 's pipe smoke , it had become a part of each tank 's personality . " I say , sir . What 's that ? " Simmons was pointing out to the left of the barrel , eleven o'clock , and he stared with the young man , could see the cloud rising up , dark , obliterating the horizon . Simmons said , " A dust storm . Big one . Bloody hell . " The young man disappeared into the tank , the hatch pulled down over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the south , farther left , swirling darkness , sunlight reflected in small flecks . The radio squawked again , a chaos of voices , and now he could see new motion , a vehicle emerging from the storm , then two more , their dust trails billowing out behind them as they roared toward the line of tanks . His heart jumped , and he raised his binoculars , saw that they were armored cars , their own , the rec boys . He glanced toward the north , toward Digby 's command tank , looking for the colored flag that would tell them to start the powerful engines . But Digby 's wire antenna held nothing but the command flag , no other sign yet . He glanced down into the tank , said , " Hands off triggers . Those are ours . " It was an unnecessary order , the big gun not yet loaded , the machine guns still waiting for the belts of ammo that would feed them . The armored cars rolled past the line of tanks , did not stop . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeez . They 're moving like hell . " He calmed now , ignored the new sounds from the wireless , thought , guess those chaps do n't like eating that dust storm any more than we do . He looked out toward the dark cloud again , no more than a mile away , rolling closer . He let out a breath . Sure . Why not start the day with another one of these damned storms ? By all means let 's eat dirt for breakfast . He began to move , lowering himself into the tank , then he stopped , frozen by a new sound . He looked again toward the great swirling cloud , ugly and familiar , the dull roar of wind and fine grit , a dozen tornadoes winding around themselves . But there were other sounds now , familiar as well . Tracks . Steel on rock . Engines . He froze , stared at the sounds , felt a light breeze in his face . That 's not a dust storm , you bloody idiot . That 's armor . Making their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he heard engines turning over , great belches of black smoke spitting from the other tanks in the formation . He looked that way , saw men disappearing into their tanks , hatches closing . He did not wait for the order from Digby , dropped down to his hard leather seat , pulled the hatch shut , shouted , " Fire ' er up ! " The driver responded , the tank pulsing , a deafening roar that drowned out the ongoing noise from the wireless . He leaned forward , searched through the periscope , felt for his machine gun , shouted again : " Load ' em ! Guns ready ! " The men moved with tight precision , each one doing his job . He looked down , saw the gunner , Moxley , right below and in front of him . He slid forward , put his knees right against the young man 's back . It was the position they had repeated many times , and Moxley never protested , the discomfort of the pressure giving them both leverage as the tank rolled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunner on the shoulder . " Wait for my order . Patience . Use the sights . How many rounds ? " " A hundred twenty . " " They 'll go quick . Do n't want to run out . Not in the mood to be a sitting duck , Private . " " Me either , sir . " " Loader ! " " Sir ! " " My Vickers ready ? " " Fit to fire , sir ! " His fingers wrapped around the trigger , and he squeezed , testing , the machine gun coming to life , a brief burst of fire . It was the signal to Simmons to do the same , the driver blessed with two of the Vickers machine guns up front . Simmons let loose a short burst . Well , all right then . We 're ready for you , Jerry . He was breathing heavily , the diesel 's smoke swirling around them , and he focused through the periscope , the dust cloud rolling closer . " Where the hell are they ? " He punched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order to move forward . No , wait . Show a little patience yourself . We do n't know what 's out there , not yet . Find a target . He spoke into the intercom now , the only way they could hear him through the roar of the engine . " Gunner . Anything ? " " Nothing yet . Just dust . " He stared as they all stared , the fine sand blowing thin clouds against the glass of the periscope , blinding , his eyes watering . He pulled his goggles off the hook beside him , slid them over his head . He hated the goggles , the lenses scratched , blurred , but they kept his eyes dry . He caught a flash of movement , above the dust cloud , coming at them , fast , now right above them . He heard the scream as it passed by and he hunched his shoulders , instinct , shouted , " 109s ! " More planes roared past , barely a hundred feet above them , and he tried to ignore them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what a Messerschmitt looks like . And , we have n't been blown to hell , so they 're not coming for us . The supply dumps or the support trucks , most likely . Strafe the infantry . Poor bastards . He thought of the antiaircraft gunners , far back , dug into patches of camel thorn brush , lucky to get a brief burst of fire at the low-flying planes . Shoot straight , boys . Knock a few Jerries out of their seats . He stared into the dust cloud again , scanned from side to side . He could still hear the Messerschmitts ripping past , thought , a good-sized flock . If there 's that many 109s , there 's something coming with them . Come on , where the hell are you ? And now he saw them . On both sides tanks erupted from the dust , rolled right past , the air punched by dull sounds , streaks of white light . He turned in his seat . " Port ! Ninety to port . Move it ! " The tank lurched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dust cloud was everywhere , churned into thick , gray fog by the movement of the big machines . The tank rumbled blindly forward over a carpet of small rocks , and there was a bright flash , a sharp streak of light , thunder on the right side . He jumped in his seat , searched the dust frantically . You missed me ! Hah ! The gunner spun the turret , and he saw the tank now , black crosses on the sand-yellow armor . The German turret was moving as well , the big gun trying to follow his movement . He shouted to Moxley : " Ten o'clock ! A hundred yards ! " The turret kept moving , painfully slowly , and he watched the barrel of the two-pounder slide into position . Moxley said , " Got him , sir ! " " Fire when ready ! " The words still hung in the air as the tank rocked from the recoil of the big gun . He fought to see through the smoke and dust , saw the crosses again , said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moxley let out a sound . " Hit him ! Hit him ! " " Fire again ! " They worked in perfect unison , the loader feeding the shells into the breech of the gun , the spent shells ejected automatically into the canvas bag that draped below . He coughed , the cordite smell filling the cabin , and still saw the crosses right in front of him . " Stop ! Watch him ! " They jerked to a halt , and he could see smoke coming from the German tank , waited for the movement , saw it now , the hatch coming open . A thick plume of black smoke poured up from inside the tank , and the men appeared , scrambling out , escaping the burning hulk .
