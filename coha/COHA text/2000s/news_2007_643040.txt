<p> BROOKE ARCE has never eaten at Le Bernardin . She has not even heard of it , even though she could walk there from her high school in Midtown Manhattan . <p> Like almost 70 percent of her classmates , Brooke , 15 , comes from a family poor enough to qualify for free school lunches . There is no way she will be eating at Le Bernardin any time soon . But she may cook there one day . <p> Brooke , who lives in Harlem , has been cooking since before she was 10 . The first dish she ever prepared was bread topped with peppers and melted cheese . " I thought it was the hottest thing on earth , " she said . <p> So she kept cooking , and watching food shows on television . Two years ago , when it was time for high school , she applied to Food and Finance High School , the first New York City high school dedicated to the food business . The school is an experiment in the city 's efforts to create more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevate culinary training . <p> At Food and Finance High School , food is woven into every aspect of the academic load . English classes use books like " Fast Food Nation " by Eric Schlosser and " My Year of Meats " by Ruth L. Ozeki . On a recent afternoon students were reading a profile of Dave Thomas , the founder of Wendy 's . <p> They learn math by measuring ingredients for a cake or by writing a business plan for a restaurant . They can earn science credits by raising bok choy hydroponically and tending to tanks of tilapia designed by a scientist from the Cornell University Cooperative Extension . <p> Coordinating the culinary program with academic classes helps the school meet the higher standards of the federal No Child Left Behind law . Other schools around the country are considering similar curriculums , said Richard Grausman , president of the Careers Through Culinary Arts Program , which helps prepare poor and minority children for food industry jobs and has trained teachers at the school . <p> Some of the school 's lessons seem simple , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brooke learned that pizza is considered Italian food . <p> " I thought it was just New York food , " she said . " But pizza margherita was named after an Italian queen . " <p> Even extracurricular activities at the school are food-related . There is an after-school program dedicated to food politics and nutrition called Eatwise ( Educated and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating ) and a catering club that prepares meals for events at the school . <p> By graduation , a student will be equipped with a certificate in safe food-handling from the National Restaurant Association and experience from a senior year internship , which might be in the school cafeteria or someplace else in the city , like Amy 's Bread . The bakery 's owner , Amy Scherber , is one of several people from New York hotel and food businesses on the school 's advisory board . <p> " This is a really cutting-edge culinary high school education , " said Jessica Mates , director of high school programs for FoodChange , the advocacy group that began in 1980 as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group is helping the Department of Education improve food in school cafeterias , runs a food pantry and a community kitchen , prepares taxes for the poor and now helps run the culinary school and its sister school ( for hotel careers ) , the High School of Hospitality Management . <p> " We 're in New York , " said Roger E. Turgeon , principal of Food and Finance High School . " What better place in the world can a kid learn to be in the hotel and restaurant business ? " <p> The school 's timing is fortunate , too . The National Restaurant Association projects that over the next 10 years the number of restaurant cooking jobs will increase by almost 17 percent , almost two and a half times the projected increase five years ago . And given the number of jobs in catering and hotels , Mr. Grausman said , " the whole sector of food service is a hidden giant . " <p> The culinary school and the school of hospitality management , which opened in 2004 and together have about 600 students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street that used to be Park West High School . Built in 1979 , Park West was designed in part as a culinary vocational school . It had 18 kitchens and a butchery room approved by the United States Department of Agriculture . Teachers from all over the city would stop in after school to buy meat butchered by the students . <p> Things changed . The culinary program turned into a parking lot for students who were out of academic options . Like other large high schools in the city , security became a problem . A baking room became a detention facility . Metal detectors were brought in . <p> Remaking that kind of high school into a new one had its challenges . The school system , designed to educate 1.1 million children at more than 1,400 schools , was not set up for the quirks of a culinary school . There was no approved school vendor , for example , that sold chef 's whites or kitchen scales . <p> Rehabilitation has been slow . A lot of the kitchens still have the dated look of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray Hobart blenders and banged-up metal scales . But there is a new kitchen , opened in March after $700,000 worth of work arranged by the office of the City Council speaker , Christine C. Quinn . Its four professional workstations rival some of the best kitchens in the city . <p> From the start , the new culinary high school has had a champion in Alex Askew , founder of the Black Culinarian Alliance . <p> " I envision this to be the West Point of culinary high school , " he said . " This is going to be the organic solution to the worker shortage facing restaurants and the need these kids have to find a career they can take on the road with them . " <p> Back in the day , when cooking was cooking , a vocational student might be able to get by with basic skills , he said . But today the culinary world is about more than knowing how to peel and slice bags of potatoes and roast big cuts of meat . So in addition to basic culinary skills the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small business . <p> One of those small businesses will be a bakery and smoothie shop at street level . It is expected to be open to the public perhaps by next year . And with luck and some outside financing , a large , glassed-in demonstration kitchen will become a television studio . These days , what 's a culinary career without a chance to be on TV ? <p> " The trick is to amass as many tools in your toolbox as you can and then you become the master mechanic , " Mr. Askew said . <p> Not every student who attends Food and Finance High School goes for the cooking . But they quickly catch the fever . Rebecca Rios , 15 , from Elmhurst , Queens , landed there by default . Now she is a star student , approaching baking with the seriousness of a pastry chef at Per Se , although she has never heard of Per Se . <p> She hopes to one day open a pastry shop at a marine park , so she can combine her new love with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savory cooking because " everything is exact . " But not restrictive , she discovered . <p> " First term we made crepes , " she said . " You could make them 100 different ways and use 100 different fillings , but it was still the same basic food . " <p> Brooke , her classmate , rejected baking for the reason Rebecca loves it . In baking , there 's no going back . <p> " If you put too much of something in , it 's going to taste nasty , " she said , " and there 's nothing you can do about it . " ##
