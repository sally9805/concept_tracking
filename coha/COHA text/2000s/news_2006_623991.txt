<p> Gail Sheehy has just called me " a slut in remission . " <p> No blows were exchanged after this rather startling  --  and startlingly accurate  --  personal analysis by the country 's leading sociological soothsayer . In fact , it came during a thoughtful discussion of the different types of middle-aged women she discovered while researching her latest best-seller , " Sex and the Seasoned Woman : Pursuing the Passionate Life . " <p> Among them : WMDs ( Women Married , Dammit ! ) , who are stuck in joyless marriages ; Status Quos , who are not miserable but stick with their marriages out of inertia ; and Passionates , women whose lusty way of living involves making bold moves , having many lovers or nurturing red-hot marriages . <p> What then would you call a woman like me who was wild in her youth but is now rather reserved in her dating ? " A slut in remission ? " jokes Sheehy , bright eyes blazing under a thatch of fashionably short red hair . <p> She laughs heartily  --  as she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Claremont Hotel . At 68 , she does n't take things too seriously ; she 's been doing book tours since her book " Passages " came out 30 years ago and knows how to roll with the insane schedule  --  and occasional bruises . <p> " In general the book has been very well received , " she says . " The reception from women so far has been hugely enthusiastic and grateful . I did n't know that there were so many women finding so many ways to redream and re-create themselves for this period of life . " <p> At the same time , she is smarting over a review in a Texas newspaper that said Sheehy 's 33o-page hardcover book " said nothing new "  --  that older women have been having hot sex lives throughout history . <p> " Women over 50 have been enjoying sex and having younger lovers forever ? " says Sheehy incredulously . " I do n't think so . I plan to write about this on my blog . Blogs are great  --  this time I have a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> " I had a great old time with Jane Juska ( author of ' A Round-Heeled Woman ' ) yesterday , and we talked about how we were both anticipating a backlash to our books . She said she thought that these were women who had put all that behind them  --  and they did n't want it put in their face , and they did n't want the pressure of thinking they had to continue to be sensual . " <p> So there are women who resist the idea that sexuality and sensuality can actually increase as they get older ? <p> " Right . I discovered this when I wrote my book ' Silent Passage . ' I had a friend whose husband left her , and she just turned off . She said something really dramatic to me : ' I just do n't want that buzz anymore . ' So women do shut that door , and they can become quite antagonistic when you suggest that they can open it again . Anytime you write about sex you are poking the hornet 's nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Sex is n't the only topic on Sheehy 's agenda this time  --  even though it 's the first word of the title ( " Must think about sales ! " she quips ) and the cover boldly displays a ripe peach . The book also addresses the more subtle aspects of aging : a hunger for spirituality , the notion of a soul mate ( which many women find as they age ) , the grand love of grandchildren , creating new dreams . <p> Sheehy culled her material by traversing the country and meeting with more than 400 women in groups . She says she has been amazed and humbled by the rebirths being experienced by middle-aged women around the country . <p> " What I 'm seeing is the same thing that my friend Jane O'Reilly wrote about for New York magazine , about women ' getting it . ' Suddenly there would be a click . They would be serving drinks to their husband and his friends and just suddenly stop . Why am I doing this ? So I think we all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an incredibly lively time of life , where we are free to make choices without guilt . Never mind what our grown children say about going off to Thailand with the 35-year-old carpenter . Sometimes it takes the group setting to open them up to the possibilities . " <p> And sometimes , Sheehy even met with men . <p> " There was a group of New York men  --  they were so funny , " she smiles affectionately . " They went to singles dances every Saturday night , and then on Wednesday nights they would meet at the diner and grouse about these women . That they needed to lose weight , etc . I 'd ask them what they were looking for , and of course they described a beautiful woman with a great body and nice clothes . And I wanted to say to them , ' When was the last time you had a full head of hair and dressed in a nice suit ? ' " <p> One thing the men had a hard time accepting was that men are not always the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy was dating this woman , but she would only go out once a week . The rest of the time she had her friends , and her grandchildren , and she 'd go to the spa on the weekends . And he was upset that she 'd rather do these things than be with him . And I said , ' Hello ! These are the things that nourish her , the things that will be there long after you 're gone . You can be a nice addition to the life of this woman , but you 're not going to be the be-all and end-all . ' " <p> Men , it is noted , handle the single life less deftly than women . <p> " Yes , " she agrees , " I 've always been curious about the happiness scale . The happiest are the married men , then the single women , then the married women , with single men being the least happy . " <p> Which is interesting , considering that the stereotype is that midlife women are craving a partner , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of my favorite groups was the Tulsa nurses . They were shocked to realize they had been single for 10 years  --  and realized they did n't really miss marriage and were n't really interested in giving up their freedom to marry again . " <p> We talk about the lack of role models so far for " seasoned women " in the movies  --  although Diane Keaton was excellent in " Something 's Got ta Give " as a woman rediscovering her sexuality . Although , I note , Jack Nicholson 's queasy reaction when he saw her naked body was ridiculous . <p> " Oh yes  --  shocking , horrifying , " Sheehy mocks . " Her body was gorgeous . And meanwhile , how cute was he with his butt cheeks flapping in his hospital gown ? I do think there is going to be a burst of supportive new images in the media for seasoned women . I think it 's just really starting now in books and articles . " <p> She has sensed a groundswell at her readings , when women approach her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're building a network . What I tell them all is that this book is only the beginning . I have a Web site now  --  **25;6398;TOOLONG  --  and I invite women to log on and share their stories . " <p> At the end of the day , she notes , she hopes she can just inspire women to open themselves up to a less complacent , more exciting way to live . " It 's about passion  --  for love , for your work , for a cause , for spiritual refreshment , and passion for sex . And one feeds into the other , and becomes a continuous loop . " <p> And for a slut in remission who 's become a bit stuck in her ways ? <p> " Well , put on the kabuki makeup and the short skirt , " she says , chuckling wickedly , " and get out there .
