HUNTING FOR ANSWERS I enjoyed the Spring 2007 article " Frozen in Time , " on hunting and fishing in national parks in Alaska , but I wish you had said something about the pertinent management policies . The romantic view of native peoples as great conservationists has been proven false , and Paul Martin and others think that early humans on this continent hunted some species to extinction in prehistoric times . Are native people free to take as much as they want of whatever they want , in whatever way they want , whenever they want ? Is hunting solely for subsistence or also for the market ? Is NPS monitoring the affected populations ? WALTER SHEPPE Akron , OH The article in the Spring 2007 issue of National Parks magazine brought to my mind a sore point about anyone hunting in our national parks . The author stressed the fact that native people have been hunting here for millennia , but they did not always use modern weapons .

BETTY MARTIN North Point , FL Thank you for the article about subsistence hunting and fishing in Alaska 's park units in the Spring 2007 issue . As an Alaska Native , I was pleased with author Dan O'Neill s feature on subsistence activities that are protected within most of Alaska 's national parks and preserves . This was the promise made to Alaska Natives when their claims of aboriginal title to Alaska lands were extinguished in 1971 . In enacting the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act ( ANILCA ) in 1980 , Congress declared a national policy of protecting the subsistence way of life and legislated a dear congressional directive to protect the cultural aspects of subsistence living as " essential to Native physical , economic , traditional , and cultural existence .

In 1980 ( the year of ANILCAs passage ) virtually all Alaska Native subsistence hunters had already adopted firearms as a means of hunting game . Congress knew this and did not expect subsistence hunters to go back to the bow and arrow days of pre-contact . Rather , Congress protected subsistence activities without distinguishing between those that were practiced pre-contact and those that have adapted since . HEATHER KENDALL Senior Staff Attorney Native American Rights Fund Anchorage , AK As Ms. Kendall notes , the survival of Native cultures in Alaska is a testament to both tradition and adaptability . Great respect and deference are traditionally given to elders , but new technologies were adopted whenever they improved the success and productivity of a hunter , gatherer , or fisherman . The evolution of weapons included the use of rocks , then spears , bow and arrow , and finally firearms .

Not because the National Park System needs a punch list of sites recognizing each ethnicity , but because through his words , deeds , and examples he lived the ideals of fairness , justice , and perseverance .

MARK DE GREGORIO Masonville , CO A PLEASANT DISTRACTION I 've been a member of NPCA for many years , and I 've always enjoyed your magazine . But the Spring 2007 issue is the best I 've ever seen . I started reading it on a crowded subway to distract myself from a nasty headache , and I soon forgot everything else . The photos were stunning and the layouts dean and inviting . I read the entire issue from front to back . I loved the mix of history with discussions of the current challenges to the park systemand the articles touting ways to experience the parks beyond the windshield of a car .
