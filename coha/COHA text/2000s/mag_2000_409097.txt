Big sister to the Picnic Boat , Hinckley 's Talaria 44 takes innovation and excellence to entirely new levels . Story by JOHN CLEMANS Photos by NEIL RABINOWITZ Photograph Photograph Photograph EXQUISITE INSIDE AND OUT . Hinckley craftsmanship is an display in the handsome pilot house . // Whoa ! Too much ! " I was maneuvering the Talaria 44 down a narrow waterway and had twisted the little knob between my fingertips a bit too far counterclockwise , causing the boat to nose too far to port . The Talaria had a steering wheel , but who wanted to mess with such tired technology . I tried to gauge how much clockwise twist would bring the boat back on track , and then I turned the knob only half that far . Pretty good ! I was getting the feel of the delicate rotational mode of the JetStick . I had quickly mastered its push-pull action , for which I credited my PacMan background . The arcade game-like device I was toying with may one day become a familiar pleasure boat guidance system . It 's hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ norm , is at least recognizable . At the moment , however , the JetStick is a novelty . But , that 's only fitting , because the Hinckley Talaria 44 is itself a novelty . What else would you call a classic , bluehulled , teak-studded , Down East-style cruiser that can slice through offshore waves at over 30 knots , run wide-open in just over two feet , stop on a dime , spin in its own length and then slide sidewise to the dock-its creamy white topsides and flawless finish exuding quality . I know ! An acrobat . Certainly there are no 40-foot cruisers around as nimble as this one . It 's a dynamo in East Egg disguise . Clark Kent comes to mind , but " mild mannered " does n't really do the Talaria ( named after the winged foot of Mercury ) justice . Starched casual is closer to the mark . It could almost be taken for an antique , but the lobster boat lines are a bit too hip . A little too much high-tech shows through . And high-tech she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , endgrain balsa coring in the sleek hull and foam in the deck , an inner skin of carbon , and laminated using the high-vacuum , environmentally friendly SCRIMP process that maximizes vinyl resin saturation . The result of this labor-intensive , time consuming approach , which Hinckley calls " DualGuard Composite Construction , " is strength , stiffness , lightness and quietness . To top it off , she 's jet-driven . But , the key factor in the Talaria 's unprecedented performance and obvious popularity ( 23 are already on order ) is that the Talaria 44 Jet , like the 36-foot Hinckley Picnic Boat , was designed around the propulsion system . This is why Hinckley has triumphed where other builders have had only modest success . Apparently , you do n't just take a conventional boat and drop in a pair of jet drives . Hinckley attacked the creation of a powerboat with all the chin-scratchin ' deliberation you 'd expect from a legendary builder of worldclass , hand-crafted sailboats whose address is Southwest Harbor , Maine . A proven design ( the Picnic Boat 's hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , narrow , 19-degree ( amidships ) hull is sharp-bowed and flattens out astern . Its shape makes it soft riding and ultraslippery , which helps hike fuel efficiency , especially at slower speeds where jets are notoriously thirsty . They behave more economically at higher speeds ( at 26.5 knots the Talaria bums 30 gph ) . One of the most crucial maneuvers in matching a hull and a power package is weight placement . Hinckley took great care to keep as much weight as possible amidships and out of the ends to achieve a balance that affords a level running attitude on plane and keeps the jets in the water in tight turns . The Talaria 's jets seem tailor-made for turning . The Talaria makes a U-turn at WOT in incredibly tight fashion without a trace of cavitation . The effort required is minimal-two turns of the wheel , or a quarter twist of the knob . If this sounds like fun , it is . Most fun of all is putting on the brakes . We came to a full stop from top speed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looks like poetry at rest , but there 's nothing leisurely about the Talaria 's performance in rough seas . // A thorough explanation of how and why the JetStick replaces conventional steering-and of how and why the jets direct the boat-would take a couple of pages . Here 's the short version . Think of the jets as pumps shooting water out of a couple of fire hoses in the stem . The harder they pump , the faster the boat moves ahead . Swiveling the linked hoses to one side or the other in tandem causes the stem to be pushed out and the bow to swing the opposite way . Lowering " buckets " into the hose streams redirects some or all of the water toward the bow of the boat rather than astern , causing the boat to be propelled backwards . Various combinations of pump pressure , hose angle and bucket position will prompt the Talaria to do everything from stand stock still to jump through hoops . Throw in a bow thruster and you 'll begin to understand why the Talaria can spin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be effected traditionally by using the wheel and the throttles . But the JetStick does the job with a fraction of the effort . Uptown express As for speed , the Talaria transcends its classic yacht club launch looks and gets up and runs like a modern express cruiser . A pair of 420-hp Yanmar 6LY-STE diesels with an excellent weight-to-horsepower ratio ( each weighs only 1,300 pounds ) are coupled to the Hamilton wate@ets . They push the sweeping , low-freeboard hull at 32 knots . Comfortable cruising range is 25-27 knots . With 500 gallons of fuel , range is over 400 miles at cruising speed , which will please Picnic Boat owners who have been asking Hinckley to build a boat for more extended cruising . The Talaria 's larger and more flexible interior plan will satisfy those who have been wishing for more living space . Although the Talaria could be called the ultimate day boat , it 's certainly suitable for overnight stays aboard . The tasteful interior is warm , with a " salty " ambiance . The cherry woodwork 's joinery is impeccable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tulip cabin sole . The salon 's dining area can be converted to a double bed by lowering the cherry table . An optional arrangement features a private stateroom in place of the dinette . Both plans include a split head-shower to starboard and head and sink with vanity to port . A centerline paneled door leads to the master stateroom with queensize bed , hanging lockers , wrap-around , satin-varnished cabinetry and entrance to the port head . Port lights and overhead hatches provide ventilation and make for a bright , airy interior . Headroom is excellent , and the U-shaped galley has an under-counter fridge and freezer , microwave , Force 10 three-burner stove and oven , big double sink and more than ample storage capacity . It might say day boat from the outside , but inside the Talaria is comfy and liveable for a jaunt from Maine to Key West . Run " outside " whenever you wish . The aft deck hatch affords access to the jets ' inspection ports . ( Any clogging can be eliminated by putting the throttles in reverse so that water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Transom hatches provide access to hydraulics and manual overrides . Engine access is of the push-button variety-the aft-facing benches lift hydraulically . With both big-sea and shallow-water capability , classic lines and JetStick control , the Talaria is in a class by itself It can go where other boats ca n't and it can be precisely maneuvered effortlessly . On top of this , it 's very quiet . The smoothness and reliability of the propulsion system is another big plus . Hamilton has had more experience building 200- to 1,000hp waterjets than any firm in the world . I could n't plunk the boat into a tight parking space the way Hinckley captain Eric Champlin could . But I was confident that I 'd soon get the hang of it . It was simply a matter of hand-eye coordination-a video game talent . When I first saw the Talaria , a broker was trying to emphasize its finger-tip maneuverability by asking , rhetorically , " What other boat this size could a mother take a couple of kids out in by herself ? " Looking at the little JetStick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of kids take their mother out in ? " They could even yell , " Look , Ma ! One hand ! " // HINCKLEY TALARIA 44 // <p>
