<p> The strains within YankeeNets , once heralded as a model for sports conglomerates , are so deep and bitter that the holding company is close to breaking apart , according to people involved with the company . <p> If YankeeNets dissolves  --  considered a near certainty by people involved in the company 's recent dealings  --  it could ultimately result in the relocation of the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils to New York under revised or new ownership . <p> The turmoil is so intense at YankeeNets , whose ownership team includes George Steinbrenner , that individual owners and suitors are exploring the idea of bringing the Nets to Brooklyn , possibly along with the Devils , or putting one or both of the teams on the West Side of Manhattan . <p> Officials with YankeeNets would not comment publicly . But the holding company  --  born four years ago as a novel marriage of a baseball and basketball team and , potentially , a wildly lucrative broadcasting network  --  has been plagued from the beginning by sharp differences over vision , finances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " said Dean Bonham , chairman of the Bonham Group , a sports industry consultant in Denver . " It 's unfortunate that the YankeeNets as an ownership model appears not to be working . " <p> In one of the more startling proposals , according to people involved in the negotiations , Lewis Katz , a wealthy businessman from New Jersey and a principal owner of the Nets , could join with the developer Bruce Ratner in moving the teams to downtown Brooklyn , where a new 20,000-seat arena would be the centerpiece of a real estate development designed by Frank Gehry , the architect responsible for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao , Spain , and the Mighty Ducks ' training facility in Anaheim , Calif . <p> The developer has asked New York City officials to come up with a memorandum of understanding by the end of the month expressing public support for the multibillion-dollar project . Under the terms of the proposed deal , Ratner is putting together a group to buy a $50 million stake in the teams . <p> The people involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they suggested that some of the details of the emerging alternatives  --  a number of which were cited in an article yesterday in The Star-Ledger of Newark  --  might have become public as the principals sought to gain some advantage in the deal-making . <p> But it is clear that those involved with YankeeNets have scrambled in recent months to resolve the company 's fate , in part because several of the principals , including Katz , must pay the former Devils owner John McMullen $50 million on Aug. 22 as a final payment for the team , according to people involved with YankeeNets . <p> A move to Brooklyn is by no means certain , and any potential change faces enormous obstacles , including the untangling of the ownership of YankeeNets , which brought together the New York-based owners of the baseball team with the New Jersey-based owners of the Nets . <p> Relocating the Nets and the Devils would also have enormous economic implications for Newark , Brooklyn and the Meadowlands . New Jersey has no intention of losing the teams to the city across the Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any move by the Nets and the Devils to New York , and a move would require approval from the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League . <p> Whatever happens , sports industry executives and people in both of the ownership groups say the YankeeNets marriage is nearly over . <p> Bonham said he was disappointed by the turn of events . If the purchase of sports teams by giant media and entertainment companies like Fox and Disney were the model for the 1990 's , Bonham said , the YankeeNets ' bottom-up combination of teams , arenas , stadiums and a broadcast network was the model of the future . <p> YankeeNets assets include the Yankees , the Nets , a 30 percent stake in the Devils and 60 percent of the YES Network . Under the merger four years ago , Steinbrenner retained control of the Yankees and a 22 percent stake in the holding company . A group led by Katz and Raymond Chambers , a philanthropist , which bought the Nets in 1998 , controls 40 percent of the holding company . Separate from YankeeNets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devils , who were acquired in August 2000 . <p> YankeeNets has been an uneasy partnership in which the two sides " did n't even speak the same language , " one person who works with the New Jersey group said in the early days of the merger . Steinbrenner has a blustery , bottom-line style and loves the limelight . Chambers , who rarely grants interviews , bought the teams in an effort to move them to Newark and revitalize the city 's battered economy . He and Katz pledged to donate all their profits to a newly formed charity , the Community Youth Organization . <p> The two groups have clashed over team management , the YES Network , players ' contracts and the purchase of the Devils . Steinbrenner has refused to help finance the Devils ' losses . <p> People involved with the two teams say that Steinbrenner and his partners consider the New Jersey owners to be rubes when it comes to the complexity of the sports business . The same people say that Katz , Chambers and another owner , Alan Landis , have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president . <p> " It 's really a divisive situation , " said one executive . " Chambers and Katz detest Steinbrenner , and Steinbrenner feels the same way about them . " <p> In the meantime , the two New Jersey teams lost about $25 million combined last year and are in the bottom ranks of their respective leagues in terms of attendance , despite the Devils ' winning the Stanley Cup for the third time in eight years and the Nets ' advancing to the N.B.A. finals for the second consecutive season . <p> Both sides want to break up YankeeNets . But , according to people involved with the teams , the owners may want to keep the YES Network in place . It has long-term agreements with the Yankees and the Nets , while the Devils are expected to join up after their current contract with Cablevision expires . Most of the owners believe that the network is valuable because it can command high prices by providing year-round sports programming . <p> The owners of the Nets spent the last four years negotiating a deal for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the state and the city . But talks foundered this spring after the teams sought special financing from the state . Some owners also began questioning the wisdom of moving the Devils to Newark , where they may not find an audience . <p> With the Devils losing money and a $50 million payment due at the end of August , Katz and other New Jersey owners began looking at alternatives in a post-Yankees world . <p> One Nets owner , Landis , talked to New York City officials , the Jets , Cablevision and Brookfield Properties about moving the Nets to a new Manhattan sports complex on 12th Avenue that would combine a new Madison Square Garden and a stadium for the Jets . But Cablevision , which owns the Garden , the Knicks and the Rangers , was not interested , according to three people involved in the talks . <p> Katz has been having more success in his discussions with Ratner about Brooklyn , where the two men figured that a large-scale real estate project could jolt the downtown neighborhood and improve the financial feasibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centerpiece of a project that would include up to 5,000 apartments and more than two million square feet of office and retail space on a 21-acre parcel at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues , opposite Atlantic Terminal and stretching toward Sixth Avenue . City officials have found the project interesting , but enormously complicated . <p> " They 've come to us with an intriguing prospect that could have enormous benefits for Brooklyn and the city , " said Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff . <p> The site , which includes a rail yard and public and private land , strikes a historical echo in Brooklyn . In the 1950 's , Walter O'Malley , the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers , wanted to build a stadium there to replace Ebbets Field . When he failed to gain permission , O'Malley moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles , leaving a hole in the Brooklyn psyche . <p> Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz has already embraced the Nets and the Devils . <p> " It would be returning to Brooklyn that which was unceremoniously taken away from us in 1957 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two and a half million people , we have great transportation and a reputation for being the most loyal fans of all . " <p> People involved with the teams say that Landis is not convinced of the viability of the Brooklyn project and expects the teams to remain in New Jersey , while Chambers would probably sell his stake in the teams if they relocated to Brooklyn . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
