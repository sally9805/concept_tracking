<p> Housesitting for the Monitor 's food editor has its perks . A full refrigerator is not one of them . I know because I decided to host a small dinner party - my first - at his home . You can imagine the level of my self-esteem as I sat in his gourmet kitchen surrounded with not one , but two food processors , a six-burner Garland stove , and such esoteric items as a Mongolian hot pot , and a Mexican chocolate swirler . I was left with terse instructions to " throw a dinner party or something , " and keep his home in order and his pets alive . Too bewildered to comb through the 100-plus cookbooks stashed on the kitchen shelves , I turned to the refrigerator for inspiration , or at least a snack . Prominently displayed on the fridge door was an old New Yorker cartoon that became my call to arms : Leaving a ritzy dinner party , a couple is depicted patronizing an obviously weary and unsuccessful hostess : " The Crab Bisque , the tournedos , the Bourbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pledged to host a dinner party . Not a potluck or pick-up-a-pizza affair , mind you . This would be a full-fledged fete , brimming with the kind of ambition that promises either raging success or ego-crushing disaster . With but a week to pull this together , I tried to think like my mom . How would she begin ? A few seconds later , I gave that up and surfed the Net . Initially , the megabytes of meal ideas whetted my appetite , but who can sort through 1,300 pages of pasta recipes ? Convinced I needed to choose some sort of " autumn " theme , I asked friends and coworkers what a good autumnal feast might include . Quite a menu emerged . I do n't remember all of the dishes , but the words truffle , stuffed , and nasturtiums featured prominently . Of course , you 'd think someone whose experience at the stove was limited to Ramen noodles and instant oatmeal would look for recipes in the " Dinner Parties for Dummies " book , but I was aiming higher . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . Those I turned to for advice naturally expected to be invited , but my budget was small , and so , necessarily , was my guest list . Still , to do this right meant expanding the guest circle beyond good friends . Otherwise , I 'd be acting out a dinner party instead of fulfilling its social function : building companionship , which in its Latin root , means " with whom you share your bread . " After the guest list was decided , I procrastinated . The week ticked by , until the morning of the big night : Time to get crackin ' . <p> 8. a.m . As in early Saturday morning . Back to bed . 10 a.m . How could I have slept in ! So much to do , so little time . Needing a fairy godmother , I call my good friend Amy , who owes me about 64 favors . So I trade those in for her services as creative consultant , kitchen maven , cleaner , and doyenne of domesticity . This is easily the smartest move I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the entrance to the local supermarket , Amy - knowing my limited skill - snickers at my ambitious menu , and suggests we let inspiration be our guide . Eight bags and $ 158 worth of groceries later , we 're ready to go . 2:30 p.m . The house is a mess . Part Chinese museum , part menagerie , and all gaudy clutter , the place needs at least a full day of scrubbing to make it presentable . With only three hours to spare , I settle for cleaning the kitchen and a thorough vacuuming. 5:30 p.m . Who knew pumpkin soup would be so hard ? Onion tears force me to leave the kitchen twice . I eat my last helping of chips and salsa , and face our first emergency : I ca n't get the food processor to work . We plug in the second one . Not a whir . Fortunately , the neighbors across the street kindly offer a blender . Before long , the rich stock is simmering , and things start to feel homey. 7:30 p.m . Waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the table adorned with stunning flowers . We decide to present the food on the dining room table , then have the guests help themselves . 7:45 p.m . The moment of truth . The first guests arrive with good cheer but bad news . They never got in touch with another set of guests who were depending on them for a ride . The implication quickly becomes clear : three of my six guests wo n't be showing up . A flurry of phone calls to salvage the situation are fruitless . Houdini though I was in the kitchen , I could n't escape the naked truth that I 'd been cavalier with my guests . I 'd hear about this later , deservedly so . 8:00 p.m . Martha Stewart eat your coeur a la creme out . This meal gets two thumbs up . Which is good , because most of the dinner-party conversation revolves around reviewing the food . The French bread with spinach-artichoke dip is tasty enough , but gets little attention as the guests fawn over the chilled pomegranate seeds . Meant only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salad , they quickly steal the show as finger food . The hearty pumpkin soup , ladled from within a roasted pumpkin , also gets good reviews , but I ca n't help thinking that it looks better than it tastes . The arugula and asparagus salad with toasted pumpkin seeds , roasted red pepper , and balsamic vinaigrette is a nice complement to the soup , but not memorable . The Mahogany Chicken is also respectable , but easily the weakest link in an otherwise strong lineup . Its accompanying roasted root vegetables - fingerling and purple potatoes , fennel , sweet potatoes with garlic , and rosemary - get much more attention . A Stan Getz album keeps the ambience enjoyable , but not intrusive . 10:00 p.m . Trying to stave off yawns from my guests , I hype up the dessert . The mood is set with soft candlelight and the thumping bass of the rap group The Roots . This amusing juxtaposition causes my guests to take note with furrowed brows . I think back to the New Yorker cartoon . " Thank you so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I nervously brought in the first round of Chai tea and baked Bosc pears served with a dollop of Haagen-Dazs Dulce de Leche ice cream . I expect the guests to wait until the host is seated to begin eating . But on my second trip , I hear one of them whisper : " This is the best dessert I 've ever tasted . " Ah , vindication : a feeling that lasts only until I discover how much cleanup awaits me when the guests leave . But this is trivial . For all of the pretense and yuppiedom associated with dinner parties , enjoying , and yes , preparing a good meal for friends was deeply satisfying . <p> Baked Spiced Pears <p> 5 Anjou or Bosc pears Unsalted butter 4 tablespoons sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream Nutmeg <p> Cinnamon <p> Cloves <p> Honey <p> Haagen-Dazs Dulce De Leche ice cream <p> Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
