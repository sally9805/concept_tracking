As John Steinbeck wrote , " it is a dream place that is n't quite real when you are there and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone . " // AMALFI COAST // SOUTHEAST OF NAPLES , WHERE THE BAY OF Naples meets the Gulf of Salerno , the ravishing Amalfi Coast stretches for thirty miles along the jagged limestone face of the Lattari Mountains . Picturesque fishing villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuring virtually every dwelling a panorama of the azure sea . But scenery is not the only reason the Amalfi Coast has become such a beloved destination . " The pleasure of being there , compared with other beach resorts , is the culture you find , " says Senator Mario D'Urso , a Roman politician whose constituency is on the coast of Sorrento and Capri . Most of the towns along the Amalfi Coast have been inhabited for thousands of years , and they reveal a fascinating blend of natural beauty and human creativity , from terraced groves and vineyards to Byzantine-influenced architecture . Each has its own character , its own cultural drift that has developed over centuries . Positano is charming and frizzante , Amalfi is historic and intriguing , and Ravello is serene and romantic . As a journalist covering Italy for Life and various travel magazines for more than twenty years , I have visited every corner of this bountiful country , from the South Tyrol 's majestic peaks to Sicily 's ancient Greek temples . But when it comes to relaxing , there is nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THERE The winding and magnificent Amalfi Coast road , described by John Steinbeck as " carefully designed to be a little narrower than two cars side by side , " is a stimulating thirty miles of hairpin turns , sheer drops to the rocky sea and too-close encounters with tour buses and delivery trucks , whose drivers seem to be as distracted by the view as the tourists . But only when two buses or trucks going in different directions meet on a difficult curve does serious gridlock occur . Carved out of the cliff in 1852 , the drive stretches along the Mediterranean from near Meta , twenty-six miles south of Naples , to Vietri sul Mare , three miles west of Salerno . The trip takes about three and a half hours from Rome ( 159 miles , mostly autostrada ) or one and a half hours from Naples ( 34 miles ) . WHERE TO STAY You can choose one hotel for your stay in , say , Positano , toward the center of the Amalfi Coast , and visit the other towns , all within easy reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel for the different character of each destination . Positano is a real resort town , with an easy nonchalance , colorful streets for strolling and shopping and a beach at the center of everything . Amalfi , with a port and a thousand years of history behind it , is bigger and busier and full of winding back streets made for escaping invaders from the sea . Ravello is idyllic , an airy retreat high above the mesmerizing coastline . Positano and Amalfi are conveniently right on the sea , but Ravello , at 1,100 feet above sea level , is cooler in the summer . ( When calling from outside Italy , preface the numbers given here with 011-39 . ) IN POSITANO MOST CHARMING : Le Sirenuse . Positano is currently a fashionable place to visit , and Le Sirenuse is its hotel of legend . Almost every room faces the sea , and the majolica-domed church of Santa Maria Assunta dominates the view . Because the hotel is in the heart of Positano , its peripheral views include the town 's charming pastelcolored houses stacked up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sersale , the family of Italian aristocrats who own and run the hotel , Le Sirenuse retains the atmosphere of a patrician residence . Its open terrace , where the restaurant , bar and heated pool are located , is without a doubt one of the most pleasant places on the planet , draped with grapes and bougainvillea . Good-size rooms , white with white-tile floors that dazzlingly reflect the sun , are decorated with a few antiques . Baths feature deeply relaxing whirlpool tubs . But the terrace is the focal point of color-the sea changes from sapphire to turquoise as the sun moves west . La Sponda , the hotel 's excellent restaurant , serves a light lobster salad with vegetables or its own homemade smoked salmon for lunch . A spanking-new spa/fitness center , designed by architect Gae Aulenti , is clean-lined and tranquil . Service could be more solicitous , however , considering the hotel 's five-star luxury category .

MOST PANACHE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Praiano , the San Pietro is justly famous for the audacity of its construction . Chiseled into the rockface , the hotel is a succession of cantilevered terraces and gardens that provide astonishing views from each unique room . Plants are so lush that they often invade the indoors , and the spacious rooms contain a luxurious mix of antiques and modern comforts . The San Pietro is for unabashed pleasure-seekers , sensualists and epicureseven many of its bathrooms feature breathtaking views , flowering plants and whirlpool baths . About one third of the sixty-one rooms are " special " and more expensive : they boast particularly stunning terraces or bathrooms with floor-to-ceiling glass walls . These can not be reserved , but are assigned on the basis of availability . The pool is beautifully situated on one of the hotel 's highest terraces . An enclosed elevator , excavated from the solid rock , carries you 262 feet down to a charming sunbathing area , a bar and a private beach with an adjacent tennis court and helicopter landing . Director Franco Zeffirelli often dines at the hotel 's restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irons . Other recent diners have included the king of Jordan and Princess Caroline of Monaco . Almost every traveler to the Amalfi Coast wants to see the San Pietro and the architectural virtuosity of its rooms sculpted out of the cliff . Says one of the San Pietro 's many loyal guests : " It has grace . It 's like class : you either have it or you do n't . " Doubles : $330 to $380 . Special rooms : $465 to $690 .

IN AMALFI MOST COMPLETE : Hotel Santa Catering . Outside the bustling town of Amalfi , the Santa Catering is located at the midpoint of the Amalfi Coast road . It is the perfect place from which to visit Positano and Ravello or to take a boat to see the coast from the water-that is , if you can ever tear yourself away from the hotel . " The Santa Catering is an island in the beauty of the coast , " says co-owner Giusy Gambardella . " You stop here and you do n't leave it again . " The reasons you need n't leave include its lovely restaurant , as well as acres of terraced gardens leading to idyllic corners where you can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea is shaded by lemon groves .

This is the hotel where Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton met for trysts , where Anna Magnani and Roberto Rossellini battled . Even the list of would-be guests who could not be accommodated recently is impressive : Bill Gates and the king of Jordan ( they requested twelve and seven suites , respectively ) . The Follia Amalfitana Suite features a large , round whirlpool for two , overlooking the sea . Chalet Giulietta e Romeo , off by itself in the gardens , is a hedonistic hideaway for honeymooners .
