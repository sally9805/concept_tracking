Day One Tff . Tff . Single drops of rain raised little divots of dust , as though invisible feet were running over the dirt . Tff . Tff . Imperceptibly , the gray ground darkened with damp , as though cloud shadow had fallen over the plain . Faces turned instinctively upward to receive the blessing of rain . The drops were huge . They exploded against cheekbone and outstretched palm , shattering into smaller drops , mixing with the sweat . It had begun . For days the weather had been oppressively hot . Now , with the rain , came a breath of welcome freshness , a fluttering breeze . My three brothers paused in their work : Shem , whetting his chisel on a stone , looked up at the sky and laughed out loud . Ham , who was boiling pitch , watched the raindrops erupt into steam on the hot , black surface of the cauldron . Japheth flinched as if the drops were hot and stood on tiptoe , looking toward the horizon . Me , I was harvesting unripe green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , instead of cutting a stalk , brought down a rain of hard green pellets to blip me in the face . The grapes were scarcely bigger or harder than the raindrops . " Be careful , Timna , " said Mother sharply . " Sweep them all up . We are going to needevery last morsel . " Those weary eyes of hers -- some days when they look at me , they seem to say , " One child too many . " A daughter is not the same blessing as a son , after all . " Shem , Ham , and Japheth : sons of Noah . " They are the only ones who will be mentioned a hundred years from now when people tell our story . I know I wo n't figure . As I crouched to sweep together the fallen grapes , a gecko ran over my hand and made me jump . Another darted between the roots of the vine . I watched them run in tandem across the parched ground and straight up the wall of the ship . It cost them no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as flat ground . They could even walk upside down across a ceiling . Miraculous . Watching them , I found I was looking through a curtain of falling rain . Only hours before , the sky had been a blatant , blazing blue . Now it was stuffed with fat , black , huddling clouds . " Is it time ? " I said into the dark doorway of the family tent . Mother 's voice came back sharp and tetchy : " Your father will tell you . " But then Father emerged from behind the tent , carrying his saw . As he passed , he laid one hand on my shoulder , and I looked up . There was rain in every upward crease of his astonishing face ; and when he winked , rain clung to the lashes of one eye for a fraction of a moment . " Nearly , " he said . " It is very nearly time . " Father could walk upside down across the sky , too , if he wanted . There 's never anything to be afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept away by the rain . Every day during the building they came and stood about , asking , " What is it for ? " " What are you doing ? " " Are you all mad ? " They 'd help themselves to the tools : go off gathering firewood with the axes and forget to return them ; borrow mallets to knock in their tent pegs , lengths of rope to hobble their animals . As the wood walls of the ship rose , they wanted all the time to look at what was inside , complaining because there was nothing inside , nothing worth seeing . Then Japheth would start to explain : " It 's Father . . . He 's found out that . . . " But the other brothers would cough , or shout loudly for the mallet bag , or drop something down from the decking and tell Japheth to bring it back up to them . " Remember , " Shem would mutter . " We keep ourselves to ourselves and our mouths shut . " The neighbors took offense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at when she tried to trade . The chickens ' coop was somehow turned over so that the chickens got loose . Ham and Shem can ignore unpleasantness , like they ignore flies settling on their hair . Shem 's wife , Bashemath , has never done anything but ignore the neighbors . I wish I could . I could n't even manage to ignore the filthy pictures the neighbors chalked on the hull of the ship . I tried , but somehow my eyes kept being drawn to them , trying to make out what they were pictures of . ( Bashemath called them " the filthy work of filthy minds . " ) I was glad when the rain came and washed off the chalk . The rude pictures blurred and faded . Ham 's wife , Sarai , was n't even allowed out of the tent during those last few days . She 'll chatter , chatter , chatter to anyone . So Mother kept her close at hand and busy sewing sacks , making hay nets , curing fish , drying raisins  --  anything to stop her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors what lay in store for them . Mother keeps me busy too . No shortage of jobs for any of us . The end of the world is a busy time if you mean to outlive it . Continues ...
