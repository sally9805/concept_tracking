Day of Atonement Chapter One Brooklyn . Not the honeymoon Decker had imagined . Twelve grueling months before he 'd rack up another two weeks ' vacation time and here he was , alone in a tiny guest bedroom , his long legs cramped from having slept on too small a bed , his back sore from lying on a wafer-thin thing that somebody had mislabeled as a mattress . He 'd bunked up in foxholes that had been bigger than this place . Most of the floor space was taken up by the pullout sofa bed . The rest of the furnishings were worn pieces old enough to be antiques , but not good enough to qualify . A scarred wooden night-stand was at his right , the digital clock upon it reading out ten-forty-two . The suitcases had been piled atop an old yellowed pine bureau adorned with teddy-bear appliqus . The sofa pillows had been stuffed into the room 's only free corner . On the east wall , two wee windows framed a gray sky . The honeymoon suite . Trs charmant . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whooping his voice raw , carrying his stepsons around on his shoulders . It had been a wild affair  --  the drinking and dancing lasting until midnight . Now his body was paying overtime for his exuberance . Of course , the undersized sofa did n't help . He chewed on the ends of his mustache , then pulled the sheet over his head . They say Jews do n't drink much , but they 've never seen ultra-Orthodox rabbis at a wedding . The men downed schnapps like water . Decker had thought his father had a large capacity for booze , but Dad was a piker compared to Rav Schulman . Dad and Mom . Sitting in the corner , wondering what the hell was flying . Cindy trying to coax Grandma to dance . Rina did get Mom to dance once . Even Mom could n't turn down the bride . But that one time had been the only time . Well , at least they came . A big surprise and a step in the right direction . They liked Rina , he sensed that immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice person . But his parents could n't come out and tell him they liked her . Mom did admit that if he had to marry another Jew , Rina seemed like a decent woman . Very high praise . Then she added that Rina seemed sincere in her beliefs even though they were dead wrong . Randy had liked Rina , too . Baby Bro liked all beautiful women , but he was n't what you 'd call a picky sort . Decker wished he could have spent some more time with Randy  --  shoot the bull about the job  --  but he and Rina just had to rush off . Had to make it to Brooklyn before the holiday of Rosh Hashanah started . What was he doing , honeymooning in Boro Park of all places ? He and Rina should have been in Hawaii , making love in the moonlight on the beach . Hell , he would have settled for staying back home on the ranch  --  just him and her . Send Sam and Jake off to visit Grandma and Grandpa in Brooklyn for the holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit her late husband 's parents . His luck : to inherit not one but two sets of in-laws . Decker stretched , his feet falling over the edge of the mattress . At least her ex-in-laws were nice people . So happy you joined us for the holidays , they had said . Rosh Hashanah will be a wonderful New Year 's with Rina and the boys and you as guests in our home . Thank you so much for allowing us the pleasure of being with you . But Decker hated looking into their eyes . He could tell what they were thinking . Why could n't you be our son , Yitzchak ? He ran his hands through damp ginger hair . It had to be tough on them . Their only son gone , he the stepfather of their boy 's children . He wished he was back home . Too many ghosts here . The clock glowed ten-forty-five . He had n't heard Rina wake up , but he knew she would n't dare abandon him . She was probably in the kitchen helping her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't visible . They 'd been thrown off in the heat of passion last night , both of them stifling laughter , hoping the flimsy bed could take all the weight . Afterward , Decker wondered if Rina had made love with her late husband in this very bed . But he had kept his thoughts to himself . Finding the energy to rise , he immediately tripped on his shoes , stubbed his toe , and cursed silently . He stripped off his pajamas , went over to the bureau and found that Rina had unpacked , his clothes neatly stowed in the first and second drawers . She 'd put his Beretta under a pile of undershirts , the clips all the way in the back under his pants . God bless an efficient woman . He attempted to open a door on the west wall . It came out about halfway before it hit the bed frame . He squeezed himself inside the cell and found a munchkin-size bathroom  --  sink , shower , and toilet . The water closet was done in old white tile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towels . He took a quick lukewarm shower ( others had gotten to the hot-water tank before him ) , his elbows hitting the walls as he soaped up . He had to duck a good foot to get his head under the shower tap . He dried himself off and dressed , his skin prickly with goosebumps . There was no room to stand and dress with the bed unfolded . He straightened the sheets and pushed the mattress inward until it slid down into the sofa frame , then put the pillows on the couch ...
