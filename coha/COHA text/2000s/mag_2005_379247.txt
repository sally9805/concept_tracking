The man who brought you Furby is back and getting ready to launch yet another cute little electronic gadget . When Roger Shiffman walked away from his job as president of worldwide marketing for Hasbro in 2001 , having earlier launched such blockbuster toys as Giga-pets , Poo-Chis and the chatty Furby , the industry was stunned . The former CEO of Tiger Electronics had pioneered the development of high-tech toys and then gone on to help Hasbro steward its branding strategies . But at 48 , Shiffman decided to leave toyland behind . For several years he took cruises and worked on his golf game . After successful surgery for a brain tumor , he was even more determined to settle into retirement  --  except that he got bored . So Shiffman , who endorsed Hasbro 's purchase of Tiger for $335 million in 1998 , is jumping back into the game with a new company called Zizzle and a mysterious new toy , iZ ( pronounced is ) . <P> Some say the return of the toy world 's storied visionary is not a minute too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price cutting from rivals , recently went private , and FAO Schwarz 's parent company twice filed for bankruptcy . Meanwhile , consolidation among toymakers means Hasbro and Mattel have ever more control over what toys get sold . But even those huge toymakers feel added pressure over what to produce , thanks to the growing buying power of such huge distributors as Wal-Mart . " We need a shake-up in toys , " says toy designer and Marvel Studios CEO Avi Arad . " I 'm sure Roger has a couple of tricks up his sleeve . " <P> Shiffman argues that things are n't so bad . " It 's still a $20 billion industry , " he says . " The challenge is to make products people want . " He hopes the answer will be iZ , which will hit stores at the end of September , and he offered TIME an exclusive first peek . It 's an inviting-looking 8-in. - tall , armless , posable animatronic DJ of sorts that plays infectious beats when you poke his belly . By twisting his ears , you create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protrusion above his head triggers more sound effects when you flick it . Dozens of musical combinations are possible from iZ , whose charms include giggling , burping and farting . " He has his own edgy personality , " says chief marketing officer Marc Rosenberg . <P> Unlike the big toy companies , which rely on market testing and focus groups to refine their new offerings , Shiffman developed iZ by following his gut . He hired Jeff Breslow , president of Big Monster Toys , the Chicago design firm , to create the new toy . " He told me , ' I want another Furby , ' " says Breslow , whose team produced the prototype three months later . iZ 's blinking beak adds $1 in costs , but Shiffman insisted on keeping it . He incorporated a jack so that users can hook up their iPod to play their own songs pumped up with riffs from iZ . Suggested retail price for iZ : $40.
