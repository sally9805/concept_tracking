Sam Simoneaux leaned against the ship 's rail , holding on in the snarling wind as his lieutenant struggled toward him <br> through the spray , grabbing latches , guy wires , valve handles . " Pretty bad belowdecks , " the lieutenant cried out against the <br> blow . <br> " That 's a fact . Stinks too bad to eat . " <br> " I noticed you have a bit of an accent . Where are you from ? " <br> Sam felt sorry for him . The lieutenant was trying to be popular with his men , but none of them could imagine such a white- blond beanpole from a farm in Indiana leading anyone into battle . " I do n't think I have an accent . But you do . " <br> The lieutenant gave him a startled look . " Me ? " <br> " Yeah . Where I was raised in south Louisiana , nobody talks like you . " <br> The lieutenant smiled . " Everybody 's got an accent , then . " <br> Sam looked at the spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a heavy frost he 'd be nearly invisible . " You come up on a farm ? " <br> " Yeah , sure . My family moved down from Canada about twenty years ago . " <br> " I was raised on a farm but figured I could do better , " Sam yelled . " The lady down the road from us had a piano and she taught it to me . Moved to New Orleans when I was sixteen to be close to the music . " <br> The lieutenant bent into the next blast of wind . " I 'm with you there . I ca n't throw bales far enough to farm . " <br> " How many days till we get to France ? " <br> " The colonel says three more , the captain , two , the pilot , four . " <br> Sam nodded . " Nobody knows what 's goin ' on , like usual . " <br> " Well , it 's a big war , " the lieutenant said . They watched a huge swell climb the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down below them in a makeshift nest of sandbags , the deluge flushing men out on deck , where they slid on their bellies in the foam . <br> The next few days were a lurching penance of bad ocean , flinttopped rollers breaking against the bows and spray blowing by the portholes like broken glass . Inside the ship , Sam slept among the thousands of complaining , groaning , and heaving men , but spent his waking hours at the rails , sometimes with his friend Melvin Robicheaux , a tough little fellow from outside of Baton Rouge . On November 11 , 1918 , their steamer escaped the mountainous Atlantic and landed at Saint-Nazaire , where the wharves were jammed with people cheering , some dancing together , others running in wild rings . <br> Robicheaux pointed down over the rusty side of the ship . " How come everybody 's dancin ' ? They all got a bottle of wine . You think they glad to see us ? " <br> Tugboats and dock locomotives were blowing their whistles through a hanging gauze of coal smoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd shown up with his rifle . The French looked like desperate people ecstatic about an approaching rescue . However , as the tugboats whistled and pushed the ship against the dock , he sensed the festival was n't for this boatload of soldiers but for some more important event . Hardly anybody was waving at the ship . <br> Four thousand troops unloaded onto the dock , and when all the men were lined up under the freight sheds and out of the wind , a colonel climbed onto a pile of ammunition crates and announced through a megaphone that an armistice had just been signed and the war was over . <br> Many cheered , but a portion of the young recruits seemed disappointed that they would n't get to shoot at anybody . The weapons hanging on them , the ammunition stacked around in wooden crates , the cannons still being unloaded by the puffing dock cranes were suddenly redundant . Sam wondered what he would tell his friends back home of his war experience . The most valuable trophies of war were the stories , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Robicheaux poked him in the back with the tip of his bayonet scabbard . " This like that time you tried workin ' at Stein 's ? " <br> " What ? " <br> " Stein , the shoe man . " <br> " Oh . I guess so . " He had tried for two weeks to get a job at Stein 's Shoe Emporium on Canal Street , but the morning after the old man had finally decided to take him on , Sam showed up for work only to find a wreath on the door and a typed note announcing the death of Solomon Stein and the permanent closure of his shop . <br> He stood in his ranks for an hour feeling awkward and unnecessary while the officers tried to figure what to do with all these soldiers and their tons of gear . Sam 's long suit was patience , or at least an ability to wait for something good to happen , so he stood there , watching the civilians cheer as the men around him grumbled that they might have to file onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was cold , and he was hungry . After a long while , boys pushing carts of food came up and fed each man a miniature loaf of hard bread with a slice of cheese hanging out like a pale tongue . Then they were marched five miles to the edge of the city , where they pitched camp in a bald field that , judging by the stumps and posturing bronze statues , must once have been a landscaped park . An icy breeze flowed down a boulevard feeding into the camp , and Sam fastened the top button on his tunic and closed his coat . He had never felt a wind that cold in his life . <br> That night he was sure he would freeze to death . Robicheaux , his tent mate , lay on his cot talking nonstop . <br> " Hey , Simoneaux , I 'm thinkin ' of a warm fire , me . Hot potatoes in each pocket . How about you ? " <br> " I 'm thinkin ' about those recruiting posters . They made joining up look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " I liked the one with the Hun molesting them Belgian women . " <br> Sam raised his head from his cot and looked at him . " You liked it ? " <br> " I mean it made me mad . Made me want to come over and help ' em out . " <br> " You wanted to make them Belgian women grateful , huh ? " <br> " You bet . " <br> Sam covered his head . " Sometimes I think about the music . I was sales clerk at Gruenwald 's when I joined up , and we got in all this sheet music full of sunshine , like ' Over There , ' ' Somewhere in France Is Daddy , ' ' Keep Your Head Down , Fritzie Boy . ' " <br> Robicheaux sniffed . " You did n't think you 'd need to keep your head down between your legs to keep your ears from freezin ' off . " <br> " So far , " Sam said dreamily , " it 's not a happy song . " At home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay fox- trot in the key of C , but the voyage on the Alex Denkman changed all that . The Denkman was a round- bottom , coal- burning nausea machine , its hull so fouled with giant streamers of rust that the government decided painting a camouflage pattern on it was unnecessary . A boy who 'd grown up in Sam 's hometown had died en route of a burst appendix and was buried at sea after a perfunctory prayer . Sam and several other Louisiana men had stood in snow flurries on the fantail and watched the shrouded figure bob in the ship 's rolling wake , refusing to sink , as though the corpse itself did n't feel right about the lead- cold sea and was trying to drift back toward the warm soil of a Louisiana graveyard . He was a Duplechen boy , his father a wiry little farmer who was good with mules . Sam knew the man and could imagine his sorrow , the vacant place at his table , the forever- broken link . This cold camp seemed a minor inconvenience next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> One morning , after a week of camping among the statues , he watched a group of officers drive up in an open motorcar and choose squads of ten to travel to Paris and work in hospitals . Sam drew this duty and was put in charge of guarding a narcotics dispensary . <br> Sometimes he was sent through the pungent wards to deliver a dose of morphine to a nurse , and the things he saw on these errands aged him . The amputations , the groaning , the smell of infection and illness were proof of how little he knew about the meanness of warfare . At the end of each day , he felt humbled and simple . Sometimes he and his contingent would walk to a cafT where there was a very bad piano , and Sam would practice for an hour straight . The men did n't talk about the things they had seen in the wards , because all of it was beyond words . Sam was afraid that talking about it would make pictures stick in his head forever . They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was so huge that the ten of them combined had never seen half of it , much less the satellite buildings and compounds . There were French hospitals . English hospitals . American hospitals . Nothing in the patriotic posters or sheet music hinted at the blown- away jawbones , the baked eyeballs , or the trembling black rubber tubes dripping pus . <br> Eventually , because he could speak Cajun French , which to the Parisians sounded like a very bad seventeenth- century patois from the south of France , he was asked to perform some rudimentary interpreting . But every Frenchman he talked to raised his eyebrows in alarm , studied his pleasant face , and asked which colony he came from . <br> In January he was pulled off hospital duty and teamed up with eight fellow Louisianans under the Indiana lieutenant , for battlefield cleanup in the Argonne . They were told they were going to a forest , and Robicheaux picked up his rifle and said , " Hot damn , maybe we can shoot us a deer and get some good meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muddy , open truck , they saw a dead and ice- glazed countryside convulsed with shell craters and stippled with exploded trees , a vast , botched junkscape of shot- apart wagons , upended tanks , and frost- etched ordnance of every description . They were given a map and told to police two square miles of it . <br> Sam stepped off the frozen track and his boot broke through a crust of ice , sinking deep into a foul- smelling brook . He pulled free and looked back at his lieutenant , tall , pale- eyed , barely there , his boyish midwestern face full of obedience and confusion . <br> " Sir , what exactly do they want us to do ? " <br> The lieutenant put a foot up on an abandoned water- cooled machine gun . " I think it 's pretty simple . We should look for the most dangerous ordnance and detonate it . " His voice was thin , and Sam remembered hearing that he was highly educated and had never seen combat . They all looked over the immense battlefield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , a stink rose out of the earth , and bristling everywhere were rusted hummocks of barbed wire . <br> They set up a camp of sorts , erecting a small tent for their supplies , and two hours after they 'd arrived , a plodding noise came from the west , and they turned to see the head of an infantryman rise up from a steep swale and then the rest of him , his right hand towing the reins of five saddled horses over the remnant of a road . He plodded on deliberately  --  like a horse himself , and stopped next to the truck . " I have orders to let you have these here animals , " he drawled . <br> " What on earth for ? " the lieutenant asked . <br> The soldier shrugged . " Each demolition group gets a team . " <br> Sam pointed over the chaos of no- man's- land . " They do n't expect us to ride these out there , do they ? " <br> " Good idea ! " the lieutenant exclaimed , his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tying them to the truck 's side rails . " From horseback you 'll be able to find the shells much better . That 's the first thing to go after . The big projectiles . We can stack them and blow them up . " He gestured toward the truck bed . " We 've been sent out with a detonator , electrical wire , and cases of dynamite . " Sam had been issued a pair of field glasses and was studying a hill to the north , his stomach heavy with foreboding . " What about the grenades ? They 're out there like gravel . " He put down the glasses and looked over at the lieutenant . <br> " I know enough not to handle them . Some might go off with just a nudge . I think we should try shooting them with our Springfields . " <br> Melvin Robicheaux took off his helmet . " Will that set them things off ? " <br> The lieutenant raised his shoulders and turned up his hands . " Pick one and shoot at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his field glasses . " I would n't do it . " <br> The lieutenant rose up on the balls of his feet . " We 'll give it a try . " <br> Robicheaux got his rifle from the rear of the truck and worked the bolt . He glanced over his shoulder . " Them horses , they been in the fightin ' or they like us ? " <br> The lieutenant turned toward the animals . " I 'd guess the gimpy pair and that one with the scarred rump are veterans . The others , I do n't know . Maybe they just came up from a transport . " He turned , put his hands behind his back , and looked up the hill . " Go ahead and shoot one . " <br> Robicheaux adjusted the sights of the rifle , aimed at a grenade on the lip of a shell crater seventy yards away , and fired . He missed , but at the crack of the rifle one of the horses whinnied and reared , pulling loose from the truck and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the hill . Sam grabbed the bridles of two of the shying horses , and the other pair stood steaming in the light snow as if nothing at all had happened . The men watched the spooked horse run up the far rise for half a mile , dodging stumps and jumping craters and then stepping on God knows what , disappearing at once in a monstrous pink fireball . The ear- flattening concussion roared back across the field like a clap of thunder and they all ran behind the truck , scanning the sky for falling debris . <br> Once the sound of the explosion had echoed away , the lieutenant turned around and pointed to Dupuis , the only veteran among them . " What did that animal step on ? " <br> Dupuis , a dour older man from Arnaudville , said , " I do n't know , Cap . I been here a whole year and do n't understand none of it . " <br> A twenty- pound piece of shrapnel came straight down out of the clouds and banged through the hood of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at where the horse had been vaporized and then up at the sky , unable to imagine this cause- and- effect , the power involved , or what they were doing here . Up on the hill , a crater smoked like an entrance to a burning mine . <br> They fanned out over the blasted countryside shooting at grenades , about half of which exploded . Sam adjusted his sights and began setting off German stick grenades that went up with earcutting thuds , both dull and sharp at the same time . After an hour he felt something like a hammer blow on his helmet . Examining a long coppery crease , he guessed it was caused by a stray shot from another man 's rifle , for other teams were working adjacent quadrants . After that , he worked in the low places , sighting in from the edge of trenches . Walking along a poisoned trickle of a stream , the water blue and stinking , he looked up the bank and saw a thighbone protruding from the earth . Downstream five German helmets sat as inert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitched to a team of killed horses frozen hard in their harness , and his thoughts began to balk against the math of the place ; there were enough unexploded grenades of all nationalities to keep him busy for a hundred years . The smell was a walking presence and a mockery of what he had imagined of war , now blasted out of his mind forever . He understood how brutally the illusion of warfare had ended for the hundreds of thousands who 'd struggled here . " What a damned lie , " he said aloud . Climbing out of the stream , he worked the bolt and fired at a French pear grenade , which tumbled away but did n't detonate . <br> Suddenly an infantryman raised his head over the next hillock . <br> " Son of a bitch , did n't they give you a compass ? You 're not supposed to fire to the northwest . " <br> They walked toward each other until only a naked ravine graveled with spent machine- gun casings separated them . <br> " You with a disposal unit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud and his helmet was missing . <br> " What 's left of one . Two of us were killed outright this morning when they kicked over grenades . Another caught a bullet in the ass , and we do n't even know who did it . " <br> " I been sure of my backdrop when I took a shot . " <br> The man held his arms up against the sky and let them drop . He looked behind him into his own sector and then back at Sam . <br> " Nobody 's ever done anything like this before . " Bareheaded , sickly small , he seemed lost and befuddled . <br> Sam spat into the ravine . " It 's a bitch , all right . " <br> " A trainload of bitches , " the infantryman said , turning back down the hill . <br> It took them all afternoon to build a stack of German three- inch shells to the size of a cord of wood , set the dynamite charges , and pay out wire to the detonating machine . They had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long trench a hundred yards away , and the ten of them piled into it . After Dupuis wired the machine , the lieutenant pushed the plunger . The explosion was astounding , and at the end of the row a man from Lafayette cried out when a chunk of shell came down and fractured his collarbone . Sam crawled through a rain of falling dirt and found that the man 's heavy coat <br> had saved his shoulder from being cut off , but that some terrible wound was bleeding under the cloth . <br> He laid him flat in the trench and as gently as he could , pulled his arm straight down by his side . The soldier roared at the hot star ofpain in his shoulder , and Sam , who had never seen such hurt , felt foolish and near tears himself . He turned to the lieutenant . " What can we do for him ? " <br> The lieutenant 's voice rose half an octave . " Well , I do n't know . " He looked up over the lip of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> Sam opened his canteen and tilted it toward the injured man 's white , clenched lips . " Maybe you could send somebody to that other bunch in the northwest . Maybe their truck works and they can come get him . " <br> The lieutenant remained silent . Dupuis volunteered to climb over the ridge to find another unit , and the man from Lafayette <br> began screaming about his bones grinding together . <br> " What can I do , bud ? " Sam asked . <br> The soldier 's eyes opened wide and looked past Sam out of a narrow , stubbled face wrinkled even in youth . " Hit me in the head with somethin ' , " he rasped . <br> The rest of the men gathered close , as though the heat of their bodies would collect and offer comfort . The wounded soldier began to fill the trench with his moans , and Sam sensed how minuscule this pain was compared to the vast agonies of the death field they were in . He looked out and saw half a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies shredded by artillery , their faces torn off , their knees disintegrated into snowy red pulp , their lungs boiled out by poison gas , and all of this for four years , spread out as far and wide as the continent itself . <br> That night , after the wounded man had been picked up by an ambulance wagon , the rest of them bedded down around their ruined truck . Robicheaux had hobbled the horses but they shuffled among the men all night and one of them stepped on Sam 's hand as he slept . In the morning his wrist was swollen and stiff , and he had trouble unbuttoning his trousers . The men washed their rations down with water and started out again , shooting not only at hand grenades , but also a certain type of four- and- a- half- inch shell that would explode if hit near the nose . For these , the lieutenant ordered them to lie flat at least seventy- five yards away before firing so the shrapnel would fly over their backs . They shot until a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had to be hauled hollering out to the road to wait for the ambulance . The remaining seven continued , gamely picking up grenades now and arranging them like ducks in a shooting gallery . They shot ineffectively at mortar rounds , and even large artillery duds . The sky faired off late , and they went on firing until sundown , their faces smudged gray with gunpowder . Between explosions they could hear teams in other sectors shooting as well , blowing up large caches , all of it a silly echo of the war itself . When the light gave out , Sam 's ears were ringing like struck anvils . Taking one last look at the darkening land , he felt fortunate and , at the same time , deeply saddened . <br> Continues ...
