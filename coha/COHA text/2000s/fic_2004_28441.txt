Chapter One " CHESSIE - oh , Chess , you 'll never guess what they 're saying in the post office . " Francesca Lloyd frowned slightly , but her attention did n't waver from her computer screen as her younger sister burst into the room . " Jen , I 've told you a hundred times , you 're not supposed to come to this part of the house , and especially not during working hours . " " Oh , nuts . " Jenny perched on a corner of the big desk , pushing aside some of the neat piles of paper to make room for herself . " I simply had to see you . Anyway , The Ogre wo n't be back from London for hours yet , " she added airily . " I checked that his car was n't there before I came round . " Chessie 's lips tightened . " Please do n't call him that . It 's neither kind nor fair . " " Well , nor is he . " Jenny pulled a face . " Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She took an excited breath . " I heard Mrs Cummings telling the post mistress that she 's had instructions to open Wenmore Court again . And that means that Alastair 's coming back at last . " Chessie 's fingers stilled momentarily on the keyboard . For a moment her heart leapt , painfully - almost brutally . She kept her voice even . " Well , that 's good news for the village . The house has been closed up for far too long . But it wo n't make much difference to us . " " Oh , Chess , do n't be silly . " Jenny gave an impatient sigh . " It makes all the difference in the world . After all , you and Alastair were practically engaged . " " No . " Chessie turned on her . " We were not . And you 've got to stop saying that . " " Well , you would have been if his beastly father had n't sent him to business school in the States , " Jenny retorted . " Everyone knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And much younger , too . " Chessie began typing again . " And a hell of a lot has happened since then . Nothing 's the same . " " Do you really think that would make any difference to Alastair ? " Jenny demanded scornfully . " I think it might . " It still hurt to remember how the weekly letters had dwindled to one a month , and then petered out altogether before the end of their first year apart . Since then , her only contact had been a brief note of condolence following her father 's death . And if Alastair had known that Neville Lloyd had died , then he almost certainly knew the circumstances of his death , she thought , wincing . " God , you can be a real drag sometimes , " Jenny accused . " I thought you 'd be thrilled . I ran all the way home to tell you . " " Jen , we should n't make assumptions . " Chessie tried to speak gently . " After all , it 's been three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not the same people any more , Alastair and I. " There 'd been a time when she 'd rejoiced in those three words , she thought sadly . When they 'd had meaning - even a future ... She squared her shoulders . " And now I 've got to get on . Please do n't let Mr Hunter come back and catch you here again . " " Oh , all right . " Jenny slid mutinously off the desk . " But how great it would be if Alastair asked you to marry him . Imagine being able to tell The Ogre what to do with his rotten job . " Chessie stifled a sigh . " It is not a rotten job , " she returned levelly . " It 's good , and well paid . It keeps food in our mouths , and a roof over our heads . And it allows us to go on living in our old home . " " As servants , " Jenny said with intense bitterness . " Big deal . " And she went out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , her face troubled . It was disturbing that even after all this time , Jenny had not been able to come to terms with the admittedly devastating change in their circumstances . She could not seem to cope with the fact that Silvertrees House no longer belonged to them - or that the only part of it they were entitled to occupy was the former house-keeper 's flat . " Yet , why not ? " Chessie asked herself , wryly . " After all , that 's what I am - the housekeeper . " " I do n't want , or need , a lot of staff , " Miles Hunter had told her at that first , fraught interview . " I require the house to be run efficiently , and without fuss , plus secretarial support . " " Meaning what , precisely ? " Chessie looked impassively back at her potential employer , trying to weigh him up . It was n't easy . His clothes , casually elegant , were at odds with the harshly etched lines of his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of his unsmiling mouth . The cool drawl gave nothing away , either . " I use a very old portable typewriter , Miss Lloyd . I always have , but my publishers now require my manuscripts on computerised disks . I presume you can handle that ? " She nodded wordlessly . " Good . On the domestic side it will be up to you what additional assistance you require . I imagine you 'll need a daily help at least . But I insist on peace and quiet while I 'm writing . I also value my privacy . " He paused . " I 'm aware this may be difficult for you . After all , you 've lived at Silvertrees all your life , and you 're used to having the free run of the place . That , I 'm afraid , ca n't happen any more . " " No , " Chessie said . " I - I can see that . " There was another brief silence . " Of course , " he said , " you may not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could solve a number of problems for both of us . " The blue eyes were vivid against the deep tan of his thin face . " So , how about it , Miss Lloyd ? Are you prepared to sacrifice your pride , and accept my offer ? " She ignored the note of faint mockery in his voice . " I ca n't afford pride , Mr Hunter . Not with a young sister to support , and educate . I 'd be more than grateful for the job , and the accommodation . " She paused . " And we 'll try not to impinge on your seclusion . " " Do n't just try , Miss Lloyd . Succeed . " He drew the file on the desk in front of him towards him , signalling the interview was ending . As she rose he added , " I 'll get my lawyers to draw up the necessary lease , and contract of employment . " " Is that really necessary ? " There was dismay in her voice . " It sounds a bit daunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's agreement ? " His mouth seemed to twist harshly , or was it just the scar that gave that impression ? " I 've never been a gentleman , Miss Lloyd , " he remarked . " And appearances are against you , too . I think it better to put things on a businesslike footing from day one - do n't you ? " And that , Chessie thought drearily , had been that . She was allowed to occupy the former housekeeper 's flat , with Jenny , for a peppercorn rent , as long as she continued to work for Miles Hunter . At the time , desperate as she had been , bleak with guilt and grief over her father , it had seemed a lifeline . Too good a proposition to turn down . Now , with hindsight , she wondered if she should have refused . Taken Jenny and herself far away from old memories - old associations . But that would have meant finding a new school for Jenny just before an important exam year , and she 'd been loth to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first it had seemed worth it . Jenny had done well , and was expected to go on to university in due course . She 'd get a student loan , but it would still mean all kinds of extra expenditure . So Chessie seemed contracted to several more years of transferring Miles Hunter 's starkly exciting thrillers onto the computer , and keeping his home running like the clockwork he demanded . It had not , she reflected , been the easiest of rides . As she 'd suspected at that first meeting , he was n't the easiest person in the world to work for . He expected consistently high standards , and could be icily sarcastic and unpleasant if these were not met , as several of the daily helps who 'd come and gone could vouchsafe . But while Chessie had adhered strictly to her own territory outside working hours , Jenny had not always been so scrupulous . ( Continues ... )
