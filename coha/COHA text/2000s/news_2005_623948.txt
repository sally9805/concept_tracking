<p> The house on lot No. 242 at Eden Shores subdivision in Hayward measures about 2,580 square feet . It has four bedrooms , two dens , hardwood floors , maple kitchen cabinets and stainless steel appliances . <p> But the most expensive component of the home 's $900,000-plus price is n't the house at all . <p> It 's the dirt . <p> Averaged across the 530-home development , the land itself  --  including the purchase price , grading , installation of water and power lines , roads and fees paid to various agencies  --  makes up roughly 40 percent of each home 's list price , according to developer Standard Pacific . <p> The sticks and bricks comprise only about one-third of the price  --  which , across the three different neighborhoods , ranged from the mid $500,000s three years ago to well over $1 million today . <p> The rest  --  roughly 27 percent  --  goes to so-called soft costs such as sales and marketing , financing and , of course , the builder 's profit . <p> " Everyone thinks that a $900,000 house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a line item , " said Douglas Krah , president of Standard Pacific 's Northern California division . <p> " It does n't cost much more to build a house here than it does in New Jersey or Michigan or Texas  --  it 's the cost of the land . " <p> And not just the raw land itself . Before the first concrete truck shows up to pour foundations , there are millions spent to prepare the lots for building . <p> In addition , Standard Pacific spent $1.5 million at Eden Shores to pay for a canal  --  referred to as the moat  --  to separate the homes ( and their cats ) from a sensitive wetland and one of its primary inhabitants , the salt marsh harvest mouse . <p> Land costs in coastal markets , with their bustling job centers and scarce space for new building , regularly outpace costs in interior parts of the country . But in California and the Bay Area in particular , the gap between land supply and demand for housing is more like a chasm . <p> Nationwide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sale price ; the home is 51 percent ; and the financing and other costs add up to about 26 percent . Profit averaged about 12 percent in 2002 , according to the National Association of Home Builders . <p> But in California and other attractive areas , the tension caused by the need to build more housing for a growing population and the reluctance of communities to approve development is putting land at a premium . <p> " That difference ( between national and local land prices ) surprises me , " said Mark Kano , the buyer of the house on lot 242 . " But I guess it is the Bay Area . It 's not like L.A. , where you can just keep building houses and then build freeways out to them . " <p> In a 2002 study , Harvard University researchers suggest that zoning and other land-use controls play a large part in making housing expensive . <p> Developers may sit on a chunk of land for years , embroiled in legal fights and prevented from building as many units as they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builder in the Bay Area , " said Jim Wilson , a building industry analyst at JMP Securities in San Francisco . " It 's not like you know you 'll have 10 subdivisions open every year . Here you ca n't predict it  --  it will go from 12 to 4 to 8 . " <p> Material costs are also on the rise , particularly because demand for certain items rose after Hurricane Katrina . <p> Just before the hurricane , the national wholesale price for a sheet of plywood was less than $10 . Just after , the price soared to more than $15 , according to the National Association of Home Builders . <p> In recent months , drywall costs have also jumped dramatically  --  about 22 percent in one week , according to Krah . <p> Some builders are going so far as to include cost-escalation clauses in their contracts , which allow them to charge buyers more than the original price if material costs go up , according to Michael Carliner , economist at the home builders association . <p> Still , as Alan Nevin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You do n't pay much more for a toilet here than you do in Arizona . " <p> So why else do Bay Area houses cost about three times the national average ? <p> In a word : profit . <p> Because the number of available homes falls far short of the number of buyers , builders can charge more.Economics 101 . <p> Think about it : If Lennar or KB Home has 10 homes for sale and 100 people show up , they know they have a very deep pool of buyers . <p> " It 's a classic case of supply and demand , " Krah said . <p> Builders say these profits are justified because of the huge risks they take in California . A developer may buy a parcel of land for $100 million , only to see it tied up for years in environmental lawsuits or battles with the city . All the while , the developer must pay finance costs and property taxes . <p> With many large builders beholden to shareholders , that means they must squeeze out a bigger profit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the profit margin on Eden Shores averaged about 12 percent , although the company earned a much higher profit on homes in later phases as appreciation soared and costs remained relatively stable . <p> For the biggest builders in the country , pre tax profit ranged from 3 to 15 percent in 2002 , according to the home builders association . <p> " People say , ' You make too much money , ' " Krah said in an interview . " Well , some years we do make too much money . But the risks we take are beyond imagination . There 's a lot more luck in this business than most of us will admit . " <p> What 's more , builders in the Bay Area are pressured to build bigger , higher-end homes . <p> " You ca n't take a quarter-million dollar lot and put a 1,400-square-foot tract house on it , " Nevin , of the state association said . " You have to put more bells and whistles on it or people wo n't pay the money . " <p> As the reverberations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , some builders may start feeling a pinch on profits . <p> In fact , early last month , shares in luxury home builder Toll Bros. tumbled 12 percent after the company warned that demand is sagging in some markets and indicated that price increases would slow . <p> The national builders group predicts new housing starts will fall from about 2.06 million this year to 1.94 million next year and 1.88 million in 2007 as the benchmark 30-year fixed mortgage rate climbs to around 6.7 percent . <p> Profit " margins have gone up because ( developers ) have been able to raise prices more than the sum total of the increases in land , labor and materials , " JMP 's Wilson said . " As demand is slowing down and heading south , land , labor and materials will follow , but with a lag . " <p> Interestingly , production of multifamily homes is not expected to fall by as much as single-family production since more builders are focusing their energies on infill development and the growing number of empty nesters who are abandoning the exburbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a price break on new townhomes , either . <p> Nevin , of the state building association , says the cost of land zoned for multifamily development has doubled in coastal California in the last several years . <p> " Big builders are n't going to built 10 units  --  they 're looking for at least five acres of land , " he said . " If you go to cities ' general plans , it looks like there 's a lot of land available . But it 's usually not because it 's environmentally sensitive or the cities say it ca n't be touched . " <p> CHART : <p> Breaking down the price of a house  --  SOFT COSTS : 27% 15% Overhead , profit and warranty 7% Finance , property tax , insurance 5% Sales and marketing  --  THE HOUSE : 33% 16.5% Labor 16.5% Materials As many as 40 subcontractors help build a new house . They buy the materials , pay their workers and charge the developer a lump sum . So , for a $1 million home , about $330,000 is spent for materials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 30% Framing 9% Concrete 7% Plumbing 6% Drywall 5% Cabinets 5% Electrical Dozens of other subcontractors , from roofers to painters to landscapers to tile setters , make up the rest .  --  THE LAND : 40% 20% Raw land purchase 10% Improvement costs ( grading , installing water , power lines ) 10% City / agency fees Source : Standard Pacific ( 1 ) Carpenter Fred Torres takes measurements for a railing as finish work continues at Eden Shores . / Paul Chinn / The Chronicle , ( 2-3 ) Finishing touches : Left , a painter trims out some stucco under the eves at a house at Eden Shores .
