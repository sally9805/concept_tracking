Most readers of F &SF; need no introduction to Mr. Bisson , whose work routinely enlivens our pages . The author of such novels as Voyage to the Red Planet , Talking Man , and Fire on the Mountain is one of the finest craftsmen of short fiction at work today . His recent books include the novel The Pickup Artist and several e-books reviewed in Charles de Lint 's column this month . His latest story appeared first ( in slightly different form ) in a Webzine entitled Gorp , edited by Eileen Gunn . We gladly bring it to you now , even if it almost cost us an arm and a leg ... <p> A GORP . COM INTERVIEW with Liam E. Suzuki , Founder and CEO of Extreme Disasters Unltd . Gorp.com : Gorp Online is here on the bridge of what is surely the most controversial ship in New York Harbor , hoping to have a few words with - Here he comes now ! Mr. Suzuki , surely you know that a lot of people disapprove of your company 's practices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's Captain Suzuki . But seriously , you can just call me Liam . And of course I know we 're controversial . Extreme sports , adventure travel , risk-taking in general has always been controversial . Ever since the first primate tried to see how far he could crawl out on a limb before it broke . It 's a love-hate thing with danger . Gorp.com : But do n't you think this is going a little too far ? Suzuki : That 's a familiar refrain , too . Look , extreme means extreme . The first BASE jumpers were considered crazy . Hell , maybe they were . That 's what I liked about them , anyway . Gorp.com : BASE jumping ? Is that how you got started ? Suzuki : No , I worked up to it . I started back in high school in Orange County . We used to crash cars to set off the air bags . It sort of grew . We figured if you packed enough kids into a Volvo with front and side air bags nobody could get seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we had fun . Gorp.com : No outdoor sports ? Suzuki : That came later . I got a bungee jump for a graduation present . I started sky diving after that . Did a little knife-edge snowboarding , avalanche racing , stuff like that . Then I met my wife Darlene - she turned me onto BASE jumping . We were part of the crowd that rollerbladed off Century Tower in downtown LA last New Year 's . Gorp.com : That one had a pretty grim casualty rate . Suzuki : Well , it was midnight . And the drinking , you know . Which reminds me ... ( Here Suzuki made a quick cell phone call to make sure the champagne had been loaded onto the ship ) .. But we learned from that . We learned that a few fatalities could add to rather than detract from an event . Gorp.com : So you went from Adventure to , Disaster . Suzuki : Not right away . It was a process . You might say it began when Darlene and I BASE jumped off a twenty-story housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges . That gave us the idea of staying in the building to see if we could survive . Gorp.com : And you did . Survive , I mean . Suzuki : Pretty much . I lost these two fingers . Darlene lost a leg . We were in the news after that , and people started contacting us . It was a short step to taking groups , packaging the tour as an earthquake survival experience . We called it Rocking Richter . That led straight into the Towering Inferno . Gorp.com : So it became a business . Suzuki : We were n't incorporated yet , but yes , somebody had to handle the permits , the logistics . Darlene and I started hiring staff , mostly thrill hounds like ourselves . The Towering Inferno was an awesome money maker . We ran six in the first two years . Booked solid , months in advance . Gorp.com : Thrill hounds , as you call them . Suzuki : Not strictly . Corporations too . Corporate accounts were our bread and butter . AT &T,; Microsoft . They used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot about your co-workers when you are trapped on the top floor of a burning building . Gorp.com : If you make it . Suzuki : Oh , you mostly make it . In fact , we guaranteed a casualty rate of not less than one or more than five , out of a group of twenty-five . Gorp.com : So what made you decide to go historical ? Suzuki : It was Darlene 's idea . She 's sort of a history buff , loves famous disasters . We did the Shackleton trek ( only we lost a couple ) and then the Medusa disaster - the nineteenth-century French shipwreck thing.A hundred naked people adrift on a raft . No food , no water . Gorp.com : That 's when Extreme Disasters became controversial . Suzuki : You 're talking about the cannibalism . But you have to understand , controversy draws as many people as it repels . We do n't do the Medusa anymore but we do a Donner Pass every winter . We have to turn people away . The Medusa was our only flop . Gorp.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that too . It 's hard to get people on a disaster tour with NO survivors . But the Hindenburg did push us into aviation . As a matter of fact , our most popular event today is " Flight 13.11 Gorp.com : How can you make that one affordable ? Suzuki : Well , for one thing , you do n't need a new plane . We build in a failure but it 's always different . Engine , hydraulics , cabin pressure , you name it . Sometimes it 's ten minutes into the flight , sometimes an hour or so . The first year we used an off-lease DC-9 . Now we use a 747 twice a year , and we 're booked at 100 percent capacity . Gorp.com : You do n't have to be athletic for that one . Suzuki : That 's right ! That 's one key to its popularity . Plus since there 's a survival rate of almost seventy percent , people can bring kids . It 's great for bonding . Say the power goes out at 39000 - it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can get real close to your wife , your kids , and yourself in that time . It 's an unforgettable experience . Have you ever tried it ? Gorp.com : No . My fiancee tried the Amtrak Experience once . Suzuki : How 'd she do ? Gorp.com : Fine . A scar on her chin she likes to show off . Suzuki : See ! That 's what we provide - bragging rights . A little excitement . Something for everybody - in this case a controlled derailment on a dirt embankment , with no fire . That keeps fatalities way down . In fact , they say it 's safer than regular Amtrak . But that 's a whole other story . Gorp.com : How about outdoor disasters ? That 's more our readers " speed . Suzuki : They should check out our Andean Avalanche , or the Mexican Mudslide . Those are both very athletic . As a matter of fact , we lost Darlene in last fall 's mudslide tour . Gorp.com : Oh , I 'm sorry . Suzuki : Darlene died doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do n't allow wheelchair in that one anymore . So you learn from your mistakes . Gorp.com : You mentioned kids . Does Extreme Disasters have anything for seniors ? Suzuki : You bet . We have two that come with AARP discounts - the Casino Bus Crash and the Nursing Home Fire . We 're working out a deal with Elderhostel for an in-school shooting thing , sort of a geriatric Columbine . And of course we have lots of seniors aboard on this trip . Corp.com : What about this trip ? I have several questions , beginning with the name . Suzuki : The Gigantic ? It 's an approximation . We could n't use the original . Too many permissions problems , what with the movie and all . But people know what it is . We were booked solid the first week we announced the cruise in the catalog . Gorp.com : Is Gigantic a one-timer ? Suzuki : We hope to do it every year . We 'll see how it goes . It 's our most expensive event so far , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fine wine , even ballroom dancing - ending in an unforgettable adventure which you have a pretty good chance of surviving . Gorp.com : No steerage passengers ? Without steerage , how can it be authentic ? Suzuki : We 're not about total authenticity . We 're about bringing you the spirit of the thing . We only have 1800 passengers and crew , but the lifeboat-to-passenger ratio is exactly the same as the original . So it should be quite a scramble , those last few hours . Gorp.com : Any idea how long it will take ? Suzuki : Four to six days tops . We 'll steam north for three days , and then start looking for an iceberg . There 's the ten-minute whistle right now . Corp.com : I 'd better get ashore . Suzuki : Care to join us ? Always glad to have Gorp aboard . I 'll comp you , as a crew member . You get a uniform and a little revolver - but no life jacket ! Gorp.com : It 's tempting , but I have a thing about cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suzuki : I can dig it . Maybe you 'll be our guest in Honolulu in December for Pearl Harbor , our first international US/Japanese co-production . The water will be warmer for sure . Gorp.com : You 're very kind . I 'll think about it . Meanwhile , good luck , Captain Suzuki .
