<p> Pueblo - The sirens made his heart pound . Every time . <p> The teacher at Columbian Grade School in Las Animas slammed the windows shut and sealed the crevices with wet towels . Young Bob Rawlings dunked his cotton mask in a bucket of water and tied it to his face . <p> The dust storms of the 1930s churned dirt , papers and trash into a tornado of uncertainty . <p> " You could n't see out a window , the visibility was virtually nil , and it would fill the room , no matter how tightly we closed the window , " Rawlings said . <p> Robert Hoag Rawlings is almost 80 years old now , but the dust storms still haunt him . His schoolboy memories , in part , fuel his most passionate crusade : keeping water in southern Colorado . <p> Rawlings is publisher , president and editor of the 55,000-circulation Pueblo Chieftain , one of about a dozen newspapers in the nation with circulation of 50,000 or more that remain locally owned . <p> The newspaper has a wide reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valleys . <p> Men who buy ink by the barrel have always had power , yet Rawlings ' influence has gone beyond his newspaper . On occasion , Rawlings himself has become news . <p> In the early 1980s , Rawlings helped create Pueblo 's Economic Development Corp . to lure jobs to Pueblo . He gave $4 million in 2000 to build the Robert Hoag Rawlings Public Library , a project mired in controversy . But water - and keeping it in the Arkansas Valley - has been his most vigorous and passionate obsession . <p> It was Rawlings who brought a group of southern Colorado leaders together a dozen times within the past year to discuss " principles and goals " for water in southern Colorado . The group met in the boardroom at The Chieftain . <p> Rawlings has been known to call elected officials to his office and " shake a finger " at them if they do n't see things his way , said Pueblo City Councilman Bob Schilling . Farmers say he has wielded his power where it is not welcome - in their mailboxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . <p> " Bob has very , very strong opinions , " said Dave Cardinal , who serves on the Rawlings Foundation , a charitable nonprofit . " If he believes in something , he believes in it 100 percent . " <p> Accused of " scare tactics " <p> His critics say he has used his position as publisher to mislead the public about a recent water agreement between Colorado Springs and Pueblo . <p> Steve Berry , spokesman for Colorado Springs Utilities , said Rawlings ' editorials amount to " scare tactics . " <p> " It 's everything , from we 're stealing Pueblo 's water , increasing pollution in Fountain Creek , reducing the robust flows on the Arkansas to a trickle ... to sending sewage down Fountain Creek for Pueblo water customers to drink , " Berry said . " The latter is the impression he 's left people with . And I 'll tell you , ... we have one of the best wastewater treatment centers in the state . " <p> Rawlings says it 's his duty to be vocal . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticized the Pueblo City Council for approving an agreement between the city of Fountain and the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District to provide minimum flows in the Arkansas through Pueblo and allow Colorado Springs to build a pipeline . <p> Aurora also approved the agreement to allow Colorado Springs to build the 43-mile , $900 million pipeline , called the Southern Delivery System . <p> " Those promises give Pueblo the short end of the stick , " the editorial says . " ... When the water is used up in El Paso County , the return flow goes down the Fountain Creek , turning it into a high-volume river and eroding the environmental quality of the river below the confluence of the two . <p> " ... Once again Pueblo is being left high and dry . Once again , despite its pledge of ' cooperation , ' Colorado Springs has given Pueblo the shaft . " <p> Berry said the newspaper 's characterization that Colorado Springs will erode Fountain Creek is not accurate . <p> " He is grossly misstating that , " Berry said . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solely our return flows . There 's sediment , agricultural runoff , municipal runoff , but he does n't address Pueblo 's storm runoff and their contribution . " <p> Rawlings denies misleading readers about water issues . And he has many defenders , community leaders who say he has the best interests of the area at heart . <p> " With a hometown newspaper , you 're far more invested in the greater good of the hometown and of the area you serve . Your heart is invested in it , and you feel a higher level of responsibility for what you report , " said Loretta Kennedy , a Pueblo County commissioner . <p> Rawlings has donated money to build a baseball complex at Colorado State University- <p> Pueblo , built the Medal of Honor Memorial to pay tribute to Pueblo 's four Congressional Medal of Honor winners and funded the remodeling of a museum in his hometown of Las Animas . <p> A water-rights scold <p> Rawlings ' roots in southern Colorado are deep . His grandfather , Frank Hoag Sr. , who moved to Colorado in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Star- <p> Journal merged in 1933 with The Pueblo Chieftain . <p> Rawlings ' uncle , Frank Hoag Jr. , was one of a half-dozen Pueblo businessmen who campaigned for the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project to bring more water to the Arkansas Valley . <p> " They saw the Dust Bowl down there , so that 's why they were so passionate to get some more water for the Arkansas Valley in order to sustain our No. 1 industry , " Rawlings said , speaking of agriculture . <p> But since then , the valley 's farmers have n't always used their water in the way Rawlings believes is best for the area . <p> " Farmers got this brilliant idea : We own the water . The farmers suddenly decided , ' Oh , this is our property and we can sell it , ' and so that 's just what they did , " he said . <p> Rawlings acknowledges that he has sent letters on Pueblo Chieftain letterhead to farmers in the valley , scolding them for selling their water . <p> He said that in one case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandfather survived the Depression and the Dust Bowl years , and did n't sell . <p> " I am critical of the farmers for selling their water outside of the basin , " Rawlings said . <p> Elizabeth Skewes , an assistant professor who teaches media ethics at the University of Colorado , said there is no code of ethics about publishers writing letters to citizens , but she believes it falls in an ethical gray area . <p> " Since he is the publisher , he can speak on behalf of the paper ; it 's not a reporter or editor doing it , " Skewes said . " On the other hand , when he does that , he is in a sense representing the paper , and it does seem that to chastise a private citizen with the weight of a newspaper behind you , I would n't feel comfortable doing it . " <p> Tom Pritekel , a commercial real estate manager who lives in Denver and owns 160 acres with his mother and brothers near Vineland in Pueblo County , does n't appreciate the publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a property right , first and foremost , " he said . <p> " If farming was such a great enterprise , why do n't you take over my farm and I 'll take over your newspaper for a 10- <p> year period of time ? And we 'll get together in 10 years and you tell me what you think . " <p> Rawlings disagrees with critics who say he has withheld news that was unfavorable to his point of view . <p> " If they accuse me of failing to write stories that we may disagree with , then I argue , because we do n't do that . ... But when they 're critical of the water policy that we take from the editorial position , ... well , I try to explain to them what my viewpoint is - what the correct viewpoint is - and how all these other water lawyers are just full of prunes . " <p> Managing editor Steve Henson said Rawlings offers story ideas but does not control the news product . <p> " The water coverage , obviously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He emphasizes that he wants those stories to get good coverage and good placement in the paper . But as far as , ' Let 's do n't put that fact there , ' there 's nothing like that . " <p> In recent years , Rawlings has had frequent offers from would-be buyers who want to purchase the newspaper . When he dies , the newspaper will be sold to an outside bidder . Proceeds will go to the Rawlings Foundation , established to help efforts in southern Colorado . <p> " I think that will be a sad day for Pueblo and both the valleys , " Rawlings said . Until then , he plans to keep working . <p> After all , Pueblo County commissioners soon will be deciding on a land-use permit , one of the steps in the approval process to allow Colorado Springs to build its Southern Delivery System . <p> Rawlings , the kid from " L.A. , " as he calls his hometown , whose heart raced when the sirens blared , plans to be in the thick of the fight .
