<p> I am overwhelmed . More than 2,200 people took my evolution quiz on ajc.com last week . More than a dozen contacted me directly with questions or comments . And that 's great news . <p> As we in Georgia discuss public school science standards and the proper place of evolution studies in the classroom , I 've been thinking about folks who are past school age . These are people who must take an active part in discussions and policy . To what extent do everyday people understand key points about evolution ? <p> I developed this quiz to touch on key misunderstood aspects of evolution . <p> Now I have the opportunity to comment on these issues , after folks have had some time to chew on them . I think the chewing is important . Education is certainly about getting the facts straight , but it is also about learning to evaluate and process those facts , and then integrate them into an expanding understanding of " life , the universe and everything . " <p> I thank everyone for participating and I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep my facts straight . <p> Question 1 . True or false : The design of animal systems ( eyes , ovaries , spleens , etc. ) is perfectly adapted to each animal 's environment because of the millions of years over which natural selection has worked on existing variation . <p> Answer : False . Most said true ( 67 percent ) . Adaptations are not perfect because they are made from whatever materials are available . There is no premeditated choice of what will come to pass , just a variety of existing options , with some that work and persist . <p> The reproductive system of women is a telling example . Sure it works pretty well , but it 's riddled with design flaws . The egg ruptures from the side of the ovary ( ouch ) and is set afloat in the body cavity to find its way to the fallopian tube , which is not directly connected to the ovary . Sure , signals are sent out to guide it , but why leave the egg afloat when it 's easy enough to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this " imperfect " design , sometimes the egg develops inside the tube , a dangerous location . <p> These descriptions give the impression of the duct tape and hacksaw approach rather than intelligent design . Selective forces are dynamic . So , given the less than optimal building materials and the dynamic forces of selection , living organisms are n't perfectly designed , but they work well enough to persist . Life is all about persistence . <p> Question 2 . True or false : The concept of evolution ( change over time ) was first put forth by Charles Darwin in his now famous book on " The Origin of Species . " <p> Answer : False . Most said true ( 57 percent ) . Evolution was not Darwin 's key contribution . Geologists and biologists before Darwin noted that the Earth and its inhabitants change over time . They contributed to Darwin 's thinking . What set Darwin apart , in biology and in history , was that he provided a mechanism  --  natural selection  --  for how evolution worked . In so doing he gave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypotheses about the pattern and process of evolution . The reason we still accept and investigate the idea of evolution via natural selection is because his proposed mechanism has undergone many tests and has fared remarkably well . <p> Question 3 . True or false : Many of the early naturalists ( 1600s to mid-1800s ) whose work cataloged and classified species on Earth were working for the greater glory of God and did not believe forms could change over time . <p> Answer : True . Most said true ( 74 percent ) . Science and religion need not be antagonistic forces . Science is a method for discovering and testing the rules that govern the physical world . It has no hold on our metaphysical views , nor do most religions preclude the pursuit of knowledge regarding the generation of biological diversity . Significant scientific discoveries have come from people who hold a wide range of religious views . <p> Question 4 . The best estimate of the age of the Earth is : <p> A. 6,000 years <p> B. 250 million years <p> C. 50,000 years <p> D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 percent said 6,000 years ; 14 percent said 250 million ; 1 percent said 50,000 and 81 percent hit the nail on the head ) . Bottom line here is that there 's been plenty of time for selection to act . Sometimes you need a lot of time , while in other cases ( like bacterial resistance to antibiotics  --  see below ) evolution can occur on a much shorter time scale . <p> Question 5 . When an antibiotic is used too often in the treatment of some bacterial infections , the bacteria can develop a resistance to the antibiotic . A key reason for the development of antibiotic resistance is : <p> A. Bacteria compete with humans for access to resources <p> B. Bacteria reproduce more rapidly than humans develop antibiotics <p> C. In order to succeed , many bacteria come genetically equipped to deal with all types of antibiotics <p> Answer : The best answer is B. ( 7 percent said A ; 36 percent B ; 57 percent C ) . The bacteria in question see humans as their resources , so that eliminates A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped to deal with all types of antibiotics , because other organisms are in the process of evolving new antibiotics to keep themselves from succumbing to these bacterial pests . Scientists are studying these promising species to learn their antibiotic secrets . B  --  What we 're really talking about is generation time , not chronological time . Evolution comes about by selection acting over many generations . Bacteria reproduce in as little as 20 minutes , so they can produce dozens of generations in a single day . If bacteria , like people , reproduced two to five copies of themselves every 50 to 70 years , we would n't have to worry about them . But some bacteria can make two to five copies before lunch . <p> Question 6 . True or false : Apart from understanding animal and perhaps human origins and relationships , the study of evolution has provided discoveries of great economic value to human societies . <p> Answer : True . Most people said this was true ( 84 percent ) . Folks nailed this one , but what are the significant contributions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was really going quite well before we understood natural selection . There 's Darwinian medicine ( selection in a vial in the quest of evolving new chemical / biological therapies ) , but it is still in its infancy . Understanding the origins of the HIV or SARS virus and how they change are questions answered by scientists with a sound understanding of evolution . Understanding the origins and mechanisms of insecticide resistance in insects plays a major role in farming practices . Last but not least , knowledge of the fossil record is very important in oil exploration . <p> Question 7 . True or false : One problem with studying evolution is that you ca n't test scientific hypotheses concerning plants or animals that have long been extinct . <p> Answer : False . Most people said this was false ( 66 percent ) . It is very straightforward to test hypotheses using the fossil record . The idea that birds and dinosaurs were related was first proposed in the late 1800s and recent fossil discoveries in China ( e.g. , " feathered dinosaurs " ) have now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how our ideas about whale evolution have changed with the discovery of more fossils . Finally , our ideas about relationships between animal groups that have been based on the fossil record are generally supported by DNA data , an independent test of these hypotheses . <p> Question 8 . True or false : Since fish ( as a group ) appear in the fossil record before humans , then all fish species must be more ancient than the human species . <p> Answer : False . Most people said this was false ( 79 percent ) . Since I spend most of my time studying fish , I am overjoyed with this result ! In short , although some fish evolved millions of years ago and have not changed much since then ( like sharks ) , there are species of fish , like some minnows , that are recent arrivals . It is relatively easy for freshwater fish to get " trapped " in a secluded environment ( like when a river doubles back on itself and in time leaves a small isolated pond in its wake ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in small populations , and this is generally recognized as a key step in at least one pathway toward the evolution of a new species . <p> Question 9 . True or false : Genetic mutation is the primary way by which variation is generated in animals . <p> Answer : False . Most people said this was true ( 70 percent ) . Mutation can generate lots of genetic novelty and is the ultimate source of variation . However , for most animals on earth , sex generates more variation than mutation . You can think about the generation of variation like the movie business . Mutation would be like a new idea or plot line . It arises spontaneously and is most often not useful , but on rare occasions is successful . In sexual reproduction , recombination takes these new ideas and combines them in a variety of ways with a smorgasbord of existing ideas and techniques . " Mutation " may generate a new plot line ( e.g. , coming of age ) but recombination then " produces " a hundred variations on that theme ( from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Question 10 . In answering these questions , I went to the following places for information : <p> A. The Web <p> B. Books <p> C. Both the Web and books <p> D. I did not look for any new information ( answered based upon what you already knew ) <p> 98 percent of respondents did not look up any new information in completing their quiz . <p> Question 11 . When I answered these questions , my views on evolution were : <p> A. It is a robust scientific theory on the level of gravity or plate tectonics <p> B. It is a fable constructed by fringe scientists to discredit religious dogma <p> C. it is a developing hypothesis that still requires rigorous testing before we can accept any part of it . <p> 71 percent went with the robust theory , 5 percent see evolution as a fable , and 23 percent are still dubious . I guess I can live with these numbers , but hope that this article will begin to make a difference here . <p> So what did I take home from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this quiz have begun to appreciate arguments and facts from scientists . People took the time to complete the quiz , and they have taken the time to discuss the questions and answers . And that was my goal . If you want more information , a good place to start is the understanding evolution Web site at evolution.berkeley.edu . You may also access more than 111,000 articles in scholarly journals over the past 30 years . <p> Yet , what I really took home from this quiz was a question . I wondered why some people have difficulty discussing and appreciating biological evolution . I went to Zoo Atlanta last week to take a picture with a fellow primate ( big thanks to the staff ) . I spent some time observing a beautiful , rare gorilla , while the ape watched me . <p> I also watched an orang mom and her baby . I reflected on our biological similarities . We are made of the same stuff ( mostly carbon , nitrogen and phosphorus ) . We are all a small subset of vertebrates ( which are dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lactation ( mammals ) . Within mammals we share much anatomy , behavior and DNA sequences with our fellow primates ( see the photo on the @issue section front ) . <p> In some very fundamental way , they are as much a part of us as we are a part of them . Maybe the problem with issues of biology education is n't our inability to understand the pattern and process of evolution , but rather our inability to understand ourselves . Grober proposed to tell us what evolution is and what it is not . No politics , no diatribes . Just science . He started last week with a quiz that tested readers ' knowledge and returns this week with the facts . ( By the way , the test takers got roughly a C overall. )
