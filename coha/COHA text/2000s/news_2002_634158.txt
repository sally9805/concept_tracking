<p> Mario Lemieux may want to spend some of his time in Salt Lake City having the U.S. Olympic men 's hockey team teach him how to handle a fire extinguisher . <p> Some of his recent comments concerning the Winter Games and Team Canada being his " main focus " and taking precedence over the Pittsburgh Penguins ' plight have ignited a full-blown controversy back home . <p> The Penguins are in 12th place in the Eastern Conference , seven points out of a playoff spot with 24 games left . <p> " You know you ca n't please everybody , " Lemieux said when asked about the perception in Pittsburgh that he has focused on the wrong team the last month . " That 's what I 've found out in my career , that it does n't matter what you do , there are always going to be people who are going to be happy and people who are going to be ticked off . " <p> Lemieux was just warming up . <p> " There are always going to be people complaining , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> That single strong statement sent sports talk radio in Pittsburgh into overdrive . Fans filled chat rooms and the letters-to-the-editor columns in the local newspapers . Some said they will cancel season tickets and vote against a new tax-supported arena for Lemieux 's team . <p> It 's a 180-degree swing from Lemieux 's love-in with the Penguins ' faithful after he came out of his 3 1/2-year retirement in the middle of last season . <p> As one sports-talker on the city 's radio put it : " The longest honeymoon in the history of Pittsburgh sports has come to a crashing halt . " <p> Forget the condensed schedule and suspending the season for 12 days to accommodate the Olympics , Lemieux 's love loss in Pittsburgh may be reason enough for the NHL to make these Winter Games its last . <p> Lemieux skipped two of the Penguins ' last six games before the break . Though he has made it a practice not to play on the second day of back-to-back games because of his hip problems , Lemieux made it sound as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " As I 've said before , I 'm just trying to get to the Olympics , " Lemieux said Monday . " That 's my main focus . " <p> His main focus ? Even as the team he owns is in jeopardy of not qualifying for the NHL postseason for the first time since 1990 ? <p> Lemieux did nothing to downplay his controversial stance once he arrived in Salt Lake City on Wednesday . <p> " My priority this year was to play in the Olympics and that 's why I have n't played too many NHL games , especially in the last couple of weeks , " he said in front of 150 reporters during a news conference . " I 've been thinking about the Olympics for a while and that 's why I skipped a few games prior to the Olympics , just to make sure I would get to the Olympics . To bring back the gold medal to Canada would be very special . " <p> More special than winning his third Stanley Cup ? <p> " It 's a difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I won in Pittsburgh 1991 and 1992 are something really special . You grow up dreaming about winning it as a kid . But there 's no doubt a gold medal would be just as special . " <p> Even when the mettle the Penguins fans are questioning is yours ? <p> RED WINGS RIFT : Coach Scotty Bowman did not hide his disgust with the Detroit Red Wings ' front office last week when the team waived veteran center Brent Gilchrist , who was picked up by Dallas . <p> " I 'm very sour , " said Bowman , who believes executive vice president Jimmy Devellano was putting finances ahead of team needs with the move . <p> Bowman , who wants veterans come playoff time , would have sent center Sean Avery , 21 , to the minors to save the same $168,000 the team banked by waiving the popular Gilchrist . <p> " Sure , send Avery down , it 's easy , " Bowman said . " He 's on a two-way contract which pays less in the minors . That 's why I 'm upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Devellano denied money mattered in the transaction . <p> " I can assure you it had nothing to do with finances , " he said . " Avery is a player who can add more to our team now than Brent Gilchrist . It 's about having the best players on the team . " <p> OFFICIALLY BURE-D : The Florida Panthers have been shorthanded 290 times this season . Coach Mike Keenan believes that number is not news to referees . <p> " I 'm sure they read the stats and they see that we 're the most-penalized team in the league . That does n't help , " Keenan said after his Panthers were whistled for 26 minutes of penalties in Wednesday 's 5-4 loss to the Blackhawks . " And the other factor is we do n't have a presence on the ice . Someone that can go to the officials  --  like most good teams do  --  and can get the ear of the officiating . " <p> No presence ? Should n't superstar Pavel Bure be able to fill that role ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keenan said of the officials . " He does n't get their ear . " <p> ON HOLD : The league has frozen all trades during the Olympic break . No deals may be made until 11 p.m. on Feb. 25 . <p> Once the freeze is lifted , watch for Florida to trade Viktor Kozlov and/or Valeri Bure , and the New York Islanders to trade goalie Rick DiPietro to Atlanta . DiPietro was the first overall pick in the 2000 draft but has developed more slowly than expected . Edmonton also will continue to shop defenseman Tom Poti . <p> Teams will be able to begin practicing Feb. 21 , under the same restrictions for training camp  --  meaning one three-hour practice per day . <p> DUDLEY DO RIGHT ? When the Tampa Bay Lightning kept Vincent Lecavalier this season , it all but decided to let GM Rick Dudley go . <p> Dudley quit under fire last week after clashing with team president Ron Campbell on several issues , including keeping the temperamental star center , which is not what Dudley wanted . <p> Dudley listened to offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 21-year-old center had held out at the start of the season before signing a four-year , $10.2 million deal . Shortly after reporting , Lecavalier clashed with coach John Tortorella and lost his captaincy . <p> " In Rick 's mind , today , he would still trade him , " Campbell told the St. Petersburg Times . <p> " It was oil and water long before that , " Dudley said of his differences with Campbell . " The chemistry was nonexistent at the top . " <p> TRADE BRUIN ? <p> Bill Guerin , Bruins : Boston general manager Mike O'Connell has until the March 19 deadline to trade his top scorer and leader or lose him for a draft pick when Guerin becomes an unrestricted free agent July 1 . He likely will command millions more than the frugal Bruins will offer . O'Connell maintains he is not shopping Guerin , though a rumored deal has Colorado offering Chris Drury for the veteran . <p> STICK FIGURES <p> Teemu Selanne , Sharks : San Jose 's star has been producing points at will since switching to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goal and added an assist in his first game with the new stick , bagged two more goals in the All-Star Game and ended up with six points at the Olympic break since making the switch . The Sharks have a five-game winning streak . <p> FAMILIAR RING <p> Mike Keane , Avalanche : Looking for leadership , Colorado reacquired Keane from St. Louis for Shjon Podein on Monday . Keane , 34 , won one of his three Stanley Cup rings with the Avs in 1996 . He waved a no-trade clause to return to Denver . Keane said he was " thrilled to be back " and showed it by assisting on the go-ahead goal in his first game Wednesday against St. Louis . <p> 400 <p> Scotty Bowman 's victory total as Detroit Red Wings coach after Wednesday 's win at Minnesota . He also had 419 wins with Montreal , making him the only coach to have at least 400 wins with two teams . <p> 500 <p> The number of dollars scalpers were asking for a ticket to the United States-Russia Olympic hockey game played @ @
