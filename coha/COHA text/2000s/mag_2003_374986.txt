For many singles , a noisy bar is the perfect setting for the rituals of courtship . But for others , loud voices , pounding music and noisy cell phones make the sweet nothings too hard to hear . Enter the Quiet Party , where all talking above a gentle whisper is banned , cell phones are forbidden and the jukebox is muted . Participants chat mostly via notes ; some are suggestive , others discuss current events , while still others seek creative potential mates by starting chain stories . The first Quiet Party took place in New York City last November , and now the idea is spreading nationwide . The first international Quiet Party is scheduled for this spring in Beijing .  --  By Lisa McLaughlin
