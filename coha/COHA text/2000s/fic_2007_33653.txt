My father explained it to me the first time when I was seven years old : The world is a system . School is a system . Neighborhoods are a system . Towns , governments , any large group of people . For that matter , the human body is a system , enabled by smaller , biological subsystems . Criminal justice , definitely a system . The Catholic Church-do n't get him started . Then there 's organized sports , the United Nations , and of course , the Miss America Pageant . " You do n't have to like the system , " he lectured me . " You do n't have to believe in it or agree with it . But you must understand it . If you can understand the system , you will survive . " A family is a system . I 'd come home from school that afternoon to discover both of my parents standing in our front room . My father , a professor of mathematics at MIT , was rarely home before seven . Now , however , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with five suitcases stacked neatly by his feet . My mother was crying . When I opened the front door , she turned away as if to shield her face , but I could still see her shoulders shaking . Both of my parents were wearing heavy wool coats , which seemed odd , given the relatively warm October afternoon . My father spoke first : " You need to go into your room . Pick two things . Any two things you want . But hurry , Annabelle ; we do n't have much time . " My mother'sshoulders shook harder . I set down my backpack . I retreated to my room , where I stared at my little pink-and-green painted space . Of all the moments in my past , this is the one I would most like to have back . Three minutes in the bedroom of my youth . Fingers skimming over my sticker-plastered desk , skipping over framed photos of my grandparents , hopscotching past my engraved silver-plated brush and oversize hand mirror . I bypassed my books . Did n't even consider my marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positively agonizing choice between my favorite stuffed dog and my newest treasure , a bridal-dressed Barbie . I went with my dog , Boomer , then grabbed my cherished baby blankie , dark pink flannel with a light pink satin trim . Not my diary . Not my stash of silly , doodle-covered notes from my best friend , Dori Petracelli . Not even my baby album , which would 've at least given me photos of my mother for all the years to come . I was a young , frightened child , and I behaved childishly . I think my father knew what I would choose . I think he saw it all coming , even back then . I returned to our family room . My father was outside , loading the car . My mom had her hands wrapped around the pillar that divided the family room from the eat-in kitchen . For a minute , I did n't think she 'd let go . She would take a stand , demand that my father stop this foolishness . Instead , she reached out and stroked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . " She grabbed me , hugging me fiercely , cheeks wet against the top of my head . The next moment , she pushed me away , wiping briskly at her face . " Outside , honey . Your father 's right-we have to be quick . " I followed my mother to the car , Boomer under my arm , blankie clutched in both hands . We took our usual places-my father in the driver 's seat , my mother riding shotgun , me in the back . My father backed our little Honda out of the drive . Yellow and orange leaves swirled down from the beech tree , dancing outside the car window . I spread my fingers against the glass as if I could touch them . " Wave at the neighbors , " my father instructed . " Pretend everything is normal . " That 's the last we ever saw of our little oak-dotted cul-de-sac . A family is a system . We drove to Tampa . My mother had always wanted to see Florida , my father explained . Would n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaches after so many New England winters ? Since my mother had chosen our location , my father had picked our names . I would now be called Sally . My father was Anthony and my mother Claire . Is n't this fun ? A new town and a new name . What a grand adventure . I had nightmares in the beginning . Terrible , terrible dreams where I would wake up screaming , " I saw something , I saw something ! " " It 's only a dream , " my father would attempt to soothe me , stroking my back . " But I 'm scared ! " " Hush . You 're too young to know what scared is . That 's what daddies are for . " We did n't live amid palm trees and white sandy beaches . My parents never spoke of it , but as an adult looking back , I realize now that a Ph.D . in mathematics could n't very well pick up where he left off , especially under an assumed identity . Instead , my father got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It meant he was home most of the day , and it seemed glamorous to be picked up from school in my own personal cab . The new school was bigger than my old one . Tougher . I think I made friends , though I do n't remember many specifics about our Florida days . I have more a general sense of a surreal time and place , where my afternoons were spent being drilled in self-defense for first-graders and even my parents seemed foreign to me : My father , constantly buzzing around our one-bedroom apartment . " What 'd you say , Sally ? Let 's decorate a palm tree for Christmas ! Yes , sir , we 're having fun now ! " My mother , humming absently as she painted our family room a bright shade of coral , giggling as she bought a swimsuit in November , seeming genuinely intrigued as she learned to cook different kinds of flaky white fish . I think my parents were happy in Florida . Or at least determined . My mother decorated our apartment . My father resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work , my mother would pose for him beside the window , and I would lie on the couch , content to watch my father 's deft strokes as he captured my mother 's teasing smile in a small charcoal sketch . Until the day I came home from school to find suitcases packed , faces grim . No need to ask this time . I went into my room on my own . Grabbed Boomer . Found my blankie . Then retreated to the car and climbed in the back . It was a long time before anyone said a word . A family is a system . To this day , I do n't know how many cities we lived in . Or how many names I assumed . My childhood became a blur of new faces , new towns , and the same old suitcases . We would arrive , find the cheapest one-bedroom apartment . My father would set out the next day , always coming home with some kind of job-photo developer , McDonald 's manager , salesclerk . My mother would unpack our meager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I stopped talking as much . I know my mom did , too . Only my father remained relentlessly cheerful . " Phoenix ! I 've always wanted to experience the desert . Cincinnati ! Now , this is my kind of town . St. Louis ! This will be the place for us ! " I do n't remember suffering any more nightmares . They simply went away or were pushed aside by more pressing concerns . The afternoons I came home and found my mother passed out on the sofa . The crash courses in cooking because she could no longer stand up . Brewing coffee and forcing it down her throat . Raiding her purse for money so I could buy groceries before my father returned from work . I want to believe he had to know , but to this day I 'm not sure . It seemed for my mother and me at least , the more we took on other names , the more we gave away of ourselves . Until we became silent , ethereal shadows following in my father 's blustery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas City . We 'd lasted nine months . My father had risen to manager in the automotive department of Sears . I was thinking of going to my first dance . I came home . My mother-Stella , she was called then-was facedown on the sofa . This time no amount of shaking woke her up . I have a vague memory of racing across the hall . Of banging on our neighbor 's door . " My mother , my mother , my mother ! " I screamed . And poor Mrs. Torres , who 'd never been granted a smile or wave from any of us , threw open her door , bustled across the hall , and hands flying to her suddenly wet eyes , declared my mother dead . Cops came . EMTs . I watched them remove her body . Saw the empty orange prescription bottle slip out of her pocket . One of the officers picked it up . He gave me a pitying look . " Someone we should call ? " " My father will be home soon . " He left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its rich smells of jalape -- o peppers and corn tamales . I admired the brightly striped curtains she had hanging on her windows and the bold floral pillows covering her worn brown sofa . I wondered what it would be like to have a real home again . My father arrived . Thanked Mrs. Torres profusely . Ushered me away . " You understand we ca n't tell them anything ? " he kept saying over and over again , once we were safely tucked back inside our apartment . " You understand we have to be very careful ? I do n't want you saying a word , Cindy . Not one word . This is all very , very tricky . " When the cops returned , he did the talking . I heated up chicken noodle soup in the tiny kitchenette . I was n't really hungry . I just wanted our apartment to smell like Mrs. Torres 's apartment . I wanted my mom to be back home . I found my father crying later . Curled up on the sofa , holding my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbed and sobbed and sobbed . That was the first night my father slept in my bed . I know what you 're thinking , but it was n't like that . A family is a system . We waited three months for my mother 's body . The state wanted an autopsy . I never did understand it all . But one day we had my mom back . We accompanied her from the morgue 's office to the funeral home . She was put in a box labeled with someone else 's name , then sent into the fire . My father purchased two small glass vials that dangled from chains . One for him . One for me . " This way , " he said , " she can always be close to our hearts . " Leslie Ann Granger . That was my mother 's real name . Leslie Ann Granger . My father filled the vials with ashes , and we put them around our necks . The rest of her , we turned loose into the wind . Why buy a tombstone that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this time my father did n't have to ask ; I had packed our suitcases three months earlier . No Boomer and blankie this time . I had placed them in my mother 's wooden box and sent them with her into the flames . Once your mother is dead , it is time to be done with childish things . I chose thename Sienna . My father would be Billy Bob , but I would allow him to use B.B. He rolled his eyes but played along . Since I 'd done the honors with the names , he chose the city . We headed for Seattle ; my father had always wanted to see the West Coast . We did better in Seattle , each in our own way . My father returned to Sears and , without ever disclosing that he 'd worked at one before , was taken to be a complete natural who flew up the managerial ranks . I enrolled in yet another overcrowded , underfunded public school , where I disappeared into the nameless , faceless B-average masses . I also committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The small Congregational church one block from our home . I walked by it every day to and from school . One day , I poked my head in . The second day , I took a seat . The third day , I found myself talking to the reverend . Will God let you into Heaven , I wanted to know , if you were buried under the wrong name ? I talked to the reverend for a long time that afternoon . He had bottle-thick glasses . Sparse gray hair . A kind smile . When I got home , it was after six , my father was waiting , and there was no food on the table . " Where were you ? " he demanded . " I got held late- " " Do you know how worried I 've been ? " " I missed the bus . I was talking to a teacher about a homework assignment . I 'm . . . I had to walk all the way home . I did n't want to bother you at work . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like myself . My father frowned at me for a long time . " You can always call me , " he said abruptly . " We 're in this together , kiddo . " He ruffled my hair . I missed my mother . Then I walked into the kitchen and started the tuna casserole . Lying , I 've discovered , is as addictive as any drug . Next thing I knew , I 'd told my father I 'd joined the debate team . This , of course , gave me any number of afternoons I could spend at the church , listening to the choir practice , talking to the reverend , simply absorbing the space . I 'd always had long dark hair . My mother used to braid it for me when I was a child . As an adolescent , however , I had relegated it to an impenetrable curtain I let hang over my face . One day , I decided my hair was blocking the true beauty of the stained glass , so I walked to the corner barbershop and had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week . And I discovered , sitting in my church , watching my neighbors come and go , that my oversize sweatshirts were too drab , my baggy jeans ill-fitting . I liked people in bright colors . I liked the way it brought attention to their faces and made you notice their smiles . These people looked happy . Normal . Loving . I bet there was n't a three-second delay every time someone asked them their name . So I bought new clothes . For the debate team . And I started spending every Monday night at the soup kitchen-school requirement , I told my father . Everyone 's got to fulfill so many hours of community service . There happened to be a nice young man who also volunteered there . Brown hair . Brown eyes . Matt Fisher . Matt took me to the movies . I do n't remember what was playing . I was aware of his hand on my shoulder , the sweaty feel of my own palms , the hitch to my breath . After the movies , we went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat over my head . And then , tucked inside his cologne-scented jacket , he gave me my first kiss . I floated home . Arms wrapped around my waist . Dreamy smile upon my face . My father greeted me at the front door . Five suitcases loomed behind him . " I know what you 've been doing ! " he declared . " Shhhh , " I said , and put a finger to his lips . " Shhhh . " I danced past my stunned father . I drifted into my tiny , windowless room . And for eight hours I lay on my bed and let myself be happy . I still wonder about Matt Fisher sometimes . Is he married now ? Has two-point-two kids ? Does he ever tell stories about the craziest girl he ever knew ? Kissed her one night . Never saw her again . My father was gone when I got up in the morning . He returned around twelve , slapping the fake ID into my hand . " And I do n't want to hear it about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my new identity as Tanya Nelson , daughter of Jeremy . " Trying to get paperwork at a moment 's notice already set me back two grand . " " But you picked the names . " " They were all the guy could give me . " " But you brought home the names , " I insisted . " Fine , fine , whatever . " He already had a suitcase in each hand . I stood firm , arms crossed , face implacable . " You picked the names , I pick the city . " " Once we 're in the car . " " Boston , " I said . His eyes went wide . I could tell he wanted to argue . But rules are rules . A family is a system .
