Poor Paul Simon . A few years ago he had the fool idea that a rock composer who wants to make it on Broadway has to go out and actually write new music . He spent years working on his musical The Capeman , only to see it bomb with the critics and at the box office . <P> Abba had it so much easier . The Swedish rock group ( whose leaders , Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus , had been burned on Broadway once before , with their 1988 musical Chess ) simply sat back and let a bunch of other folks take Abba 's hit songs , graft them onto a flimsy story about a girl looking for her real dad on her wedding day and turn Mamma Mia ! into a smash hit on Broadway  --  and just about everywhere else in the Western world . <P> Guess which musical everyone wants to copy ? <P> It 's a post-Mamma Mia ! world , and the theater has fallen in love with rock  --  so long as it 's retro . Opening next month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on the campy John Waters movie and featuring ersatz ' 50s music by Marc Shaiman . Meanwhile , there 's hardly a rock star or group from the ' 60s , ' 70s or ' 80s not about to be celebrated in a songbook musical reprising the greatest hits . We Will Rock You , a sell-out hit in London that boasts Robert De Niro among its backers , sets more than 30 songs of the ' 70s rock band Queen to a jokey sci-fi fable about a future world where live music has been banned . Billy Joel 's oeuvre has been matched to Twyla Tharp 's choreography in Movin ' Out , which is prepping in Chicago for a Broadway opening this fall . There 's a Beach Boys musical in the works and another one on the Doors , and even a Bruce Springsteen show , Drive All Night , with its sights set on Broadway . " Pop music can be overpowering , " says Tharp , explaining the appeal of the oldies . " It has so much connotation in people 's minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trend is unfortunate . They have a point . The peculiar magic of the musical form lies in convincing an audience that story and songs are an organic whole , that one ca n't live without the other . In most of the rock-songbook shows , the story is simply a clothesline on which to hang some presold hits the audience was humming on the way into the theater . Queen 's We Are the Champions and Bohemian Rhapsody may or may not be your idea of great rock , but either way , in the college-revue tedium of We Will Rock You , they do n't do much to illuminate story or character  --  or reach out to anyone but the die-hard Queen fan . <P> Not all the retro-rock productions are so crass . A quieter new musical hit in London is an engaging little show called Taboo , which recaps the rise and drug-addled fall of Boy George , the androgynous former lead singer of the band Culture Club . The surprise is that , aside from three old favorites ( with Karma Chameleon as the obligatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , written by ( former Boy ) George O'Dowd himself . Helped by Christopher Renshaw 's cabaret-style production and a dead-on performance as George by Euan Morton , O'Dowd 's supple melodies and touching but tough lyrics seem to encapsulate the defiantly deviant club world of London in the early ' 80s : " Call me a taker/ I 've got nothin ' to give/ Call me a loser/ I 'm just tryin ' to live . " Call Taboo a winner  --  and let 's get it to the U.S.
