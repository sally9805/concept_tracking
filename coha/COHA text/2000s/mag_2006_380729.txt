THE POWER BROKER REWARDING GOOD BEHAVIOR <P> Fred Krupp wants to do something about the carbon dioxide that spews from tailpipes and smokestacks . But why is the president of Environmental Defense looking for solutions in tropical rain forests and Kansas cornfields ? Because forests and fields pull greenhouse gases from the air . So Krupp , 52 , went to Brazil to urge protection of the Amazon basin and to Kansas to promote no-till farming . Plowing fields releases CO2 ; if farmers plant seeds without tilling , three-quarters of a metric ton of carbon per acre could be stored every year . <P> What 's in it for Brazilians and Kansans ? Environmental Defense is lobbying Congress to approve a system that would mandate reductions in emissions and allow the sale of permits to release specified amounts of carbon . Companies having trouble cutting emissions could buy allowances from firms that have unused permits . Or they could pay farmers to store carbon and developing nations to preserve forests . The idea comes from a concept developed by Environmental Defense when Krupp helped draft the 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control sulfur dioxide . Krupp believes similar financial incentives could slow global warming . " Once you put a value on carbon reductions , " he says , " you make winners out of innovators . You offer a pot of gold .

But his uncharacteristic classroom stumble led Li to a field that could play an even larger role in China 's future : energy production . " I think the choice was a very fortunate one in the end , " says Li , who studied thermal engineering and in 2000 became a full professor at Tsinghua  --  China 's M.I.T.  --  at the remarkably young age of 35 . " Energy is incredibly important for a growing society like China . " <P> But energy means carbon , and China 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's No. 1 greenhouse-gas emitter as early as 2020 . Li knows that China needs clean energy as badly as the developed world needs China to clean up , which is why he joined the Tsinghua-BP Clean Energy Research and Education Center as director when it opened in July 2003 . The center 's most promising project is a new technology called polygeneration , by which coal is converted into a cleaner gaseous fuel that can both generate electricity and be processed into a petroleum substitute . Polygeneration could cut the carbon emissions China generates by burning its copious coal reserves and reduce its dependence on oil imports . While his team continues to refine the technology  --  it 's still more expensive than direct coal combustion  --  Li is lobbying the government to construct a $600 million demonstration plant , and he 's optimistic he will see it built . " China is motivated to develop this technology , " Li says . And the rest of the world is hoping it does .  --  By Bryan Walsh/Hong Kong <P> THE SNOW MAN OF ASPEN KEEPING WINTER COOL  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
