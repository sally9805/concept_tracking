Evan Cooper had never liked predawn pages . <p> In his four years on the FBI 's Hostage Rescue Team , he 'd pulled his share of all-nighters . And those were fine . He 'd much rather stay up until the sun rose than be awakened by that rude alert . Especially on a Saturday after a late night of partying . <p> Stifling a groan , he groped around the top of his nightstand until his fingers closed over his BlackBerry . Once he 'd killed the piercing noise , he peered at his watch in the darkness , forcing his bleary eyes to focus . According to the LED dial , it was four in the morning . Two hours of sleep . <p> Not enough . <p> Resigned , Coop clicked on his in-box . Normally , his adrenaline would already be pumping as he speculated about what crisis had escalated to the point that the nation 's most elite civilian tactical force would be called in . But in his present condition , the address line did little more than arouse mild curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed to him alone rather than to his full team , as usual ? <p> Squinting in the dark , Coop scanned the clipped directive from Les Coplin , head of the HRT . <p> Meet me at Quantico ASAP . <p> No explanation . No clue about why this meeting could n't wait until a decent hour . Just a summons . <p> In other words , typical Les . <p> After four years of this drill , Coop simply shifted into autopilot . And thirty minutes later , he found himself striding down the too-bright corridor toward Les 's office with no actual recollection of getting dressed , driving to Quantico , going through security , or parking his car . <p> It was almost scary . <p> " You look about as alert as I feel . " <p> At the wry comment , Coop glanced over his shoulder . Mark Sanders closed the distance between them in a few long strides and fell into step beside him . <p> " One too many beers last night ? " Mark queried . <p> " At least . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny the obvious . Mark had been by his side most of the evening . " I take it you got a page too ? " <p> " Yep . " He scanned the deserted hallway . " Looks like it 's just you and me , kid . A two-man job . This might be interesting . " <p> Maybe , Coop conceded . After I wake up . <p> " How come you 're so perky ? " Coop gave Mark a suspicious look . The two of them were often teamed up on missions that called for partners , and their on-the-job pairing had led to a solid friendship . " You had as much to drink as I did . " <p> " I also stopped for a cup of coffee at the quick shop on the way in . " <p> " Smart . " <p> " I thought so . " Mark 's lips quirked into a smirk . " Hey , maybe Les will take pity on you and offer you some of his special brew . " <p> The commander 's thick-as-motor-oil sludge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I might take him up on it . " <p> " Whoa ! " Mark 's eyebrows shot up . " You did have a rough night . Or else you 're getting old . " <p> " Thanks a lot , buddy . " In truth , he felt every one of his thirty-eight years this morning . <p> Chuckling , Mark stopped outside Les 's office and slapped Coop on the back . " Hey , what are friends for ? " He lifted his hand to knock but froze as a gruff voice bellowed through the door . <p> " Do n't just stand there . Come on in ! " <p> Rolling his eyes , Mark pushed the door open and stepped aside , ushering Coop in first . <p> " Now you decide to be polite , " Coop muttered under his breath as he passed . <p> Mark 's soft chuckle was the only response . <p> " Sit . " Les waved them into chairs and fished out some file folders from the sea of papers on his desk . He worked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he scrutinized the men across from him . <p> " You two look like something the cat dragged in . " He turned to Coop . " Especially you . Get some caffeine . " He motioned to a coffeemaker on a small table against the wall . <p> After exchanging a look with Mark , Coop rose in silence and filled a disposable cup three-quarters full , stirring in two packets of creamer to cut the bitterness of the noxious swill that masqueraded as coffee . Nothing got past Les , Coop reflected . One quick , assessing glance was all it had taken for the man to figure out who had fared the worse from a night of barhopping . <p> His astute powers of observation were no surprise , though . A former green beret and HRT operator , Les had headed the Hostage Rescue Team for the past two years . And he 'd earned the respect of every HRT member with his keen insights and cut-to-the-chase manner . He 'd also earned the nickname Bulldog , thanks to his stocky build , close-cropped gray hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As Coop retook his seat , grimacing at his first sip of the vile brew , he ignored the twitch in Mark 's lips and focused on Les . <p> " I 've got a job for you two . Ever hear of David Callahan ? " <p> Mark shot Coop a silent query . At the almost imperceptible shake of his partner 's head , he answered for both of them . " No . " <p> " Did n't think so . He keeps a low profile . Here 's some background you can review later . " He tossed a file across the desk , and Coop fumbled with his coffee as he grabbed for it , the murky liquid sloshing dangerously close to the rim of the cup . <p> Les scowled at him and chewed his cigar . " Keep drinking that coffee . " Settling back in his chair , he ignored the flush that rose on Coop 's neck . " David Callahan works for the State Department . Has for forty years . He 's been in about every hot spot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By reputation , he 's a savvy diplomat and a tough but fair negotiator . When you see the secretary of state shaking hands with foreign leaders after a diplomatic coup , you can bet David Callahan had a hand in it . I assume you 're both versed on the current hostage situation in Afghanistan . " <p> It was a statement , not a question . <p> To Coop 's relief , Mark took pity on him and accepted the volley . The coffee was starting to work , but he was n't yet ready to dive into this game . <p> " Yes . The basics , anyway . An unidentified terrorist group kidnapped three Americans a week ago and is demanding the release of a number of extremists who are in custody , as well as a large ransom . The hostages are a wire service reporter , the director of a humanitarian organization , and a State Department employee . The last I heard , things were at a stalemate . " <p> " That 's right . It 's a dicey situation . Callahan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 's facing immense pressure to convince the State Department and the Afghan government to reconsider that stance . And the terrorists just raised the stakes . " <p> Leaning forward , Les passed a file to Mark . " Background on Monica Callahan , David 's daughter . " <p> " How is she involved ? " Mark took the file . <p> " She is n't . Yet . And it 's up to you to keep it that way . " <p> " I 'm not sure I understand . " Twin creases appeared on Mark 's brow . <p> " Three hours ago , the terrorists gave David Callahan a vested interest in the outcome by threatening his daughter . " Les turned to Coop . " You with us ? " <p> " Yes , sir . But I 'm not sure I understand , either . Should n't this be handled by State Department personnel ? " <p> " In general , yes . David Callahan 's own security is being managed internally . But he wanted the best available protection for his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <p> " The secretary of state asked for HRT involvement ? " Mark sent Les a surprised look . <p> " No one asked for anything . It was an order . " Les chewed on his cigar for a few seconds . " And it came from the White House . " <p> Stunned , Coop stared at him . " The White House ? " <p> " The coffee must be kicking in . Good . " Les worked his cigar to the other side of his mouth . " Now that I have your full attention , we can talk about your assignment . " <p> " Is the daughter in Afghanistan ? " Mark asked . <p> " No . Much closer to home . Richmond , Virginia . I want you and Coop on dignitary protection duty 24/7 until this hostage situation is resolved . " <p> " That could be weeks , " Coop said . <p> " And your point is ... " Les pinned him with a piercing look . <p> Coop took a fortifying gulp of his coffee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Les removed his cigar long enough to take a swig from his own mug . " We 'll work the intelligence angle from here and try to intercept any imminent threats . I need you two on the ground with Monica Callahan to provide physical protection . " He passed another file over to Mark . " Classified intelligence on the hostage situation and terrorist cells in the U.S. that could be connected to it . " <p> " Is a safe house being arranged ? " <p> At Mark 's question , Les leaned back in his chair and squinted . Not a good sign , Coop knew . Their boss only squinted in tense situations-or if things were n't going as planned . <p> " That would be the most effective way to deal with the situation . And we 're securing a location now . But we have a challenge to deal with first . " <p> As Coop leaned forward to wedge his coffee cup into a tiny bare spot on Les 's desk , he exchanged a glance with Mark . His partner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " challenge , " he meant " problem . " And with the White House watching over their shoulders , problems were not a good thing . <p> " I 'm assuming you 'll explain that . " Coop 's even , controlled tone reflected none of his sudden unease . <p> " The lady is n't aware of the danger because she has n't responded to her father 's calls . As you 'll discover from her file , they 've been estranged for many years . " Les delivered his bombshell matter-of-factly . " So your first challenge , gentlemen , will be to convince her she needs protecting and get her on board with the program-despite her feelings about her father . " <p> The last vestiges of fuzziness vanished from Coop 's brain . They were supposed to protect an uncooperative subject from a terrorist threat with the White House looking over their shoulders . <p> Wonderful . <p> From the set of his jaw , Mark was n't any more thrilled by the assignment than he was , Coop deduced . <p> Dignitary protection details were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HRT had joined the group to play nursemaid to high-powered , pampered VIPs . And that 's what these gigs amounted to in most cases , as he and Mark knew firsthand . You stashed the person in a safe house and babysat until you got the all clear . <p> In other words , you were bored out of your mind . <p> But he 'd take that kind of assignment in a heartbeat compared to the one Les had handed them . One wrong step , and their careers would be toast . <p> " We 'll feed you intelligence as we get it , " Les continued . " And we 'll proceed on the assumption that you 'll convince Ms. Callahan it 's in her best interest to cooperate . In the meantime , get up to speed on those files and head down to Richmond . I want you on the job by nine o'clock . The local field office is handling covert surveillance until you get there . Any questions ? " <p> Coop and Mark exchanged a look but remained silent . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Rising , Coop gripped the file folder on David Callahan and picked up his coffee . As he followed Mark out the door , he glanced at the murky dregs sloshing in the bottom of the cup . They turned his stomach . <p> And the assignment Les had handed them was having the same effect . <p> As for luck ... he had a feeling they were going to need a whole lot more than that to emerge from this job unscathed . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
