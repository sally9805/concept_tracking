In 1891 , when he had long since had his fill of Paris , of its constipated moods , its bourgeois proprieties and its hostility to him , the 43-year-old Gauguin wrote to the Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro : " More than ever I am convinced that there is no such thing as exaggerated art . And I even believe that there is salvation only in extremes . " <P> The extreme he would go to was Tahiti , where , while looking for paths beyond the exhausted conventions of Western art , he would make some of its greatest works . " Gauguin Tahiti , " which opens this week at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts after a hugely successful run at the Grand Palais in Paris , is one of the largest exhibitions ever mounted of those wild , influential canvases and carvings . Beautifully organized by George T.M. Shackelford of the Boston MFA and Claire Freches-Thory of the Musee d'Orsay in Paris , it reaches a wide-screen crescendo with the Boston MFA 's great canvas Where Do We Come From ? What Are We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summation of his personal universe . <P> Altogether the show holds 125 pieces by a man who worked at high pitch in oils , ceramics , prints and stone sculpture , to say nothing of wood carvings of a first-rate perversity . In Be in Love and You Will Be Happy , completed two years before he left France , but previewing what would be the Tahitian style , he carved a monstrous rendition of himself reaching toward a hesitant nude woman . A critic described it as " the deformed sculpture of a sadistic faun , whose kisses are slobbery and disgusting . " You can see why he was tempted to leave France . <P> Gauguin 's reception in this century has been very different . Is there any tale in modern art quite like that of his flight to the South Seas ? More than a century after his death in 1903  --  at 54 , from syphilis , nearly alone in the Marquesas , the islands where he fled when Tahiti proved too spoiled  --  his self-imposed exile still serves as the last word in escape fantasies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a native culture in tune with his most uncivilized impulses and where he could discharge energies , artistic , spiritual and phallic , that bow-tied Europe wanted no part of . Even D.H . Lawrence , that subsequent prophet of the primal against the merely civilized , made a kind of homage to Gauguin in later life , when he bolted for New Mexico . <P> When Gauguin decided , at 35 , to give himself over full time to his art , he did it with a passion . He abandoned his job as a stockbroker and deposited his Danish wife Mette and their five children back in Copenhagen , never to see them again . Tahiti would break his heart , of course . What he knew of the island was built mostly out of visits to the Paris World 's Fair and from the romantic fabrications of the novelist Pierre Loti . By the time Gauguin made the first of his two voyages , in 1891 , the native culture he hoped to find had been dressed , churched and adulterated by colonial administrators and Christian missionaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
