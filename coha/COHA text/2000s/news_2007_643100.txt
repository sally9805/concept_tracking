<p> Israel is constructing a road through the West Bank , east of Jerusalem , that will allow both Israelis and Palestinians to travel along it  --  separately . <p> There are two pairs of lanes , one for each tribe , separated by a tall wall of concrete patterned to look like Jerusalem stones , an effort at beautification indicating that the road is meant to be permanent . The Israeli side has various exits ; the Palestinian side has few . <p> The point of the road , according to those who planned it under former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon , is to permit Israel to build more settlements around East Jerusalem , cutting the city off from the West Bank , but allowing Palestinians to travel unimpeded north and south through Israeli-held land . <p> " The Americans demanded from Sharon contiguity for a Palestinian state , " said Shaul Arieli , a reserve colonel in the army who participated in the 2000 Camp David negotiations and specializes in maps . " This road was Sharon 's answer , to build a road for Palestinians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how to connect the West Bank while keeping Jerusalem united and not giving Palestinians any blanket permission to enter East Jerusalem . " <p> Mr. Sharon talked of " transportational contiguity " for Palestinians in a future Palestinian state , meaning that although Israeli settlements would jut into the area , Palestinian cars on the road would pass unimpeded through Israeli-controlled territory and even cross through areas enclosed by the Israeli separation barrier . <p> The vast majority of Palestinians , unlike Israeli settlers , will not be able to exit in areas surrounded by the barrier or travel into Jerusalem , even into the eastern part of the city , which Israel took over in 1967 . <p> The road does that by having Palestinian traffic continue through underpasses and over bridges , while Israeli traffic will have interchanges allowing turns onto access roads . Palestinians with Israeli identity cards or special permits for Jerusalem will be able to use the Israeli side of the road . <p> The government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has recently made conciliatory gestures to the Palestinians and says it wants to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . But Mr. Olmert , like Mr. Sharon , has said that Israel intends to keep the land to the east of Jerusalem . <p> To Daniel Seidemann , a lawyer who advises an Israeli advocacy group called Ir Amim , which works for Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in Jerusalem , the road suggests an ominous map of the future . It is one in which Israel keeps nearly all of East Jerusalem and a ring of Israeli settlements surrounding it , providing a cordon of Israelis between largely Arab East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank , which will become part of a future Palestinian state . <p> In a final settlement , Israel is expected to offer the Palestinians land swaps elsewhere to compensate . <p> The road will allow Israeli settlers living in the north , near Ramallah , to move quickly into Jerusalem , protected from the Palestinians who surround them . It also helps ensure that the large settlement of Maale Adumim  --  a suburb of 32,000 people east of Jerusalem , where most of its residents work  --  will remain under Israeli control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as E1 , between Maale Adumim and Jerusalem , which Israel also intends to keep . <p> For the Palestinians , the road will connect the northern and southern parts of the West Bank . In a future that may have fewer checkpoints , they could travel directly from Ramallah north of Jerusalem to Bethlehem south of it  --  but without being allowed to enter either Jerusalem or the Maale Adumim settlement bloc . <p> " To me , this road is a move to create borders , to change final status , " Mr. Seidemann said , referring to unresolved issues regarding borders , refugees and the fate of Jerusalem . " It 's to allow Maale Adumim and E1 into Jerusalem but be able to say , ' See , we 're treating the Palestinians well  --  there 's geographical contiguity . ' " <p> Measure it yourself , he said . " The Palestinian road is 16 meters wide , " or 52 feet , he added . " The Israeli theory of a contiguous Palestinian state is 16 meters wide . " <p> Khalil Tufakji , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Sharon 's plan : two states in one state , so the Israelis and the Palestinians each have their own roads . " The Palestinians , Mr. Tufakji said , " will have no connection with the Israelis , but travel through tunnels and over bridges , while the Israelis will travel through Palestinian land without seeing an Arab . " <p> In the end , he said , " there is no Palestinian state , even though the Israelis speak of one . " Instead , he said , " there will be a settler state and a Palestinian built-up area , divided into three sectors , cut by fingers of Israeli settlement and connected only by narrow roads . " <p> Asked for comment , David Baker , an Israeli government spokesman , said : " The security arrangements on these roads are in place to protect the citizens of Israel . And they are not connected to any other matter . " <p> A spokesman for the Israeli military 's civil administration department pointed out that Palestinians with permits to enter Israel could use the Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the road will be a quicker , better route from north to south than any current route . <p> There are numerous roads that only Israelis and Israeli-permit holders can travel on , but none segregated like this one . <p> E1 has been a key battleground in the struggle over control of Jerusalem . Some , like Martin S. Indyk , a former American ambassador to Israel now running the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution , argue that Israel should yield E1 to the Palestinians . " E1 is a critical issue in maintaining the territorial integrity and contiguity of the West Bank with East Jerusalem  --  it 's the only place where it 's possible to do that , " he said . <p> Israel has promised the United States that it will not build housing now in E1 , freezing a plan to construct 3,500 homes . But Israel is completing a large , four-story police station on a commanding hill in E1 , intended to be the main police headquarters for the West Bank , and it is laying down electrical and water lines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What is nearly finished now , awaiting the fixing of lights and the completing of tunnels and underpasses , stretches about 2.4 miles . <p> The road is currently open to the West Bank , but it cuts through the intended path of the Israeli separation barrier , which has not yet been built around E1 or Maale Adumim . <p> Presuming that the barrier will be completed , the road will be a kind of umbilical cord that cuts through Israeli-controlled and walled territory to connect the two parts of the West Bank . <p> " Now there 's a big gap in the barrier between Azzariya and Shuafat , " of about 2.4 to 3 miles , " and Israel has n't started to build the fence around Maale Adumim , " said Mr. Arieli , the reserve colonel . " But this road will be the answer if and when Israel builds the fence around Maale Adumim . You see that Israel is creating the conditions for the future . They try to take advantage of the current situation to prepare the infrastructure for the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that Mr. Olmert , facing many problems now , will not start building in E1 , but that the leader of Likud , Benjamin Netanyahu , if he is elected prime minister , might do so . Mr. Netanyahu said in 2005 that he would build in E1 no matter what Washington thought . <p> Micaela Schweitzer-Bluhm , a spokeswoman for the American Consulate in Jerusalem , repeated American policy that Palestinians should be allowed to travel more easily through the West Bank " consistent with the need to maintain security . " Asked if this road predetermines final status , she said , " The U.S. government has encouraged the parties to avoid any actions that would predetermine permanent status , " but said she was not authorized to comment more specifically . <p> Mr. Tufakji said he had become cynical about the way Israel builds for the future it defines , no matter what it promises Washington . He sees a West Bank divided into three parts by Israeli settlement blocs , the most important of which are Maale Adumim and E1 , around the capital that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infrastructure to keep E1 , to surround Jerusalem , " he said . " They are working to have an area of minimum Palestinians and maximum Israelis . " ##
