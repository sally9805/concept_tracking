Chapter One The silhouette of the Basilica of St. Mark was black against the paling predawn sky . The pillar and the winged lion in the Piazza San Marco could just be made out . In the bow of the gondola Benito shifted uneasily , looking at it . " Figlio di una puttana , woman , " he said , trying to sound older than fourteen . " Ca n't you get a move on ? It 'll be sunup before I 'm home . " He wished his voice would stop cracking like that . Marco said it was just part of growing up . He wished that that would stop too . Being bigger was no advantage for climbing or running . And if he stopped growing , he might stop being so hungry all of the time . Up on the stern the hooded oarsman ignored him , moving slowly and steadily . " You want me to row this thing for you ? " he demanded . " Shut up , " she hissed . " You want to attract attention ? At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rushing . " Benito had to acknowledge that it was true enough . Even now there were three other vessels moving on the Grand Canal . All of them slowly . He sighed . " I just need to get back home . I 'm supposed to see my brother . " She snorted . " If you had n't held us up , we 'd be the other side of Campo San Polo by now . And you ca n't be in any more of a hurry to get back to whatever rat-hole you sleep in , than I am to see the back of you . I should never have agreed to take you . " Benito huddled down in the bow . This woman 's tongue was even sharper-edged than Maria Garavelli 's . The wind between the ornately facaded buildings was cold . He was cold and , as usual , he was hungry . It had been a fruitless night . Mercutio had let him down . Again . He liked working jobs with Mercutio . His ideas were exciting , daring and , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized it was going to be nip-and-tuck . Skin of your teeth stuff and needing lots of luck . But somehow Mercutio always seemed to have that luck . Benito sighed . Mercutio also had the habit of not turning up for a job . Benito had sat waiting for four cold hours for him tonight , and not a copper 's profit to show for it . He could have used some more coin . All he had in the attic was a half crock of elderly fagioli stufata . It was definitely past its best . The beans were producing gas before they even hit his stomach . * * * His eye was caught by the body . It bobbed in the dark water under the pilings as the tiny fish plucked at it . That was a fine cloak .... A few knife slashes could be dealt with . His jaw dropped . The rich soft swollen white hand still had rings on it . He turned to speak . " Do n't even look , " she hissed between clenched teeth . " But ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oar . " Shut it ! " There was such intensity in that quiet command that Benito did n't even dare to glance at the corpse again . They poled on in silence , the bow of the shabby gondola cutting the oily , still water , here where it was sheltered from the predawn breeze . Most of Venice was still sleeping . When she spoke , they were a good hundred yards past the corpse . " Despini . " Her voice shook slightly . She was plainly shocked . Benito looked warily at her . " What ? " A stray strand of long , wavy , copper-colored hair had found its way out from under her hooded cloak . She pushed it back . Whatever this girl moved must be valuable . That was a well-fed wrist . " Gino Despini . He was one of my customers . He had a booth down on the Calle Farnese . Sold love philters , charms and amulets of protection against the French Pox . " Benito nodded sagely . That was the sort of cargo she moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strega around the Campo Ghetto did n't always want to declare their imports to the state or the church . Dangerous , tricky cargoes . But valuable . " So why did n't you want to stop ? Get those rings , or take him to his family ... " She raised her eyes to heaven . " You 're a fool . Whoever killed him could have sunk him if they just wanted him dead . They did n't even rob him . What does that mean ? " she demanded . Benito knew he was out of his league here . He was a good enough sneak thief . But this ... " He was wounded but escaped , died and fell in the canal , " he ventured warily . She shook her head . " You do n't know anything , do you , boy ? If they left his body to float , they 're not scared of the Schiopettieri . " Benito swallowed hard . The Schiopettieri were professional soldiers under the official command of Venice 's Signori di Notte ... The Lords of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In effect , they were the city 's police force . You did n't mess with them . " That spells someone with influence and power , " she continued . " Whoever killed him obviously does n't need money . " She pursed her lips . " There was a rumor about that he was more than what he seemed . A Strega Mage proper , not a charlatan . He was left to float either as message , or more likely , as bait . " Bait . " Who did it ? " he asked , huskily . This was deep , dark water . The woman shrugged . " Maybe the Servants of the Holy Trinity . They 've been pretty active lately . So have the agents of the Council of Ten . Maybe other Strega . But I do n't think so . They favor magic or poison . He 'd been stabbed . " " Bait ... " " They 'll take whoever comes to go on with their questioning . If it 's the Servants , you know how they question people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your soul . " She raised an eyebrow and said sardonically , " You were thinking of sneaking back there , were n't you ? " " I did n't understand . " The boy answered humbly . " But Katerina ... " " Who told you my name ? " she demanded fiercely . " Captain Della Tomasso ... Look ! " While they 'd been talking , a flotilla of rowing boats had appeared and were coming along the Grand Canal . Rowing steadily in measured strokes . The leading ones were definitely Schiopettieri oarships . " Merda ! " Katerina spat . " It must be a sweep . We 've got to get out of here . " She began to scull frantically , pushing the gondola towards the mouth of a narrow canal . Benito got up hastily . He was getting off the unfamiliar water and onto the buildings . Quickly . " They 'll have blocked off the side canals , Kat . " " Right . " She pushed the boat into a group of tied up gondolas and small craft moored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped a loop over the bollard . " Lie down ... little brother . We 're poor boatkids who 've lost our parents and have to sleep on the water . " Benito looked askance at her . But he lay down on the gondola ribs next to her . She pulled a grubby piece of sailcloth over them . She also tied a piece of cord to a knobbly yellow oilcloth parcel from the bow . She dropped the parcel gently over the side , down into the still water . Hastily she tied it off . Benito wondered what the hell cadging a ride across from Guidecca had gotten him into . He liked a bit of excitement , but messing with people who knew people who were being killed by the Servants was too much . * * * It was too much , thought Katerina , lying on the ribs of the gondola . Here she was with a cargo that could get her burned at the stake . Even if they never picked it up ... well , if it came to hard questioning they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if they used magic , they could find out everything . Unless , like Despini , you had defenses that would kill first . Holy Mother . She must not be caught . The dishonor to the family if she were ! It would kill the old man . Every time she 'd gone out she 'd known it was a risk . But they could simply not afford to lose another cargo . And who else could they trust ? Somehow the Casa Montescue , secure for all these years , had been infiltrated . There was no other explanation . She looked up . They were tied up beside the Imperial embassy . Across the canal was the pretentious Casa Brunelli . Pah . Nouveau riche . Curti . They had glass windows instead of the varnished silk that real Longi Case Vecchie used . The kind of neighborhood that the Schiopettieri would not take kindly to finding loiterers in , even if they did n't pick up the parcel dangling from the bow . She looked across , not without a certain envy , at the ornate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone on the third floor balcony of the Casa Brunelli . " Lie still , " Kat said between clenched teeth to the wrigglesome urchin next to her . " There is someone on the balcony up there . " To give him credit , the boy did n't peer . He froze . " Who ? " " How would I know ? You ... you canal-brat . It 's hard to make out anything in this light . A man , by the way he stands . " " He must have seen us come in , " whispered the boy . Kat could feel him tense next to her . Getting ready to run . " Stay still ! " She hissed . Benito 's dark eyes flickered nervously . Then she felt him tense again . " They 're stopping . They 're coming here ! " Kat reached for the slipknot on the cord . " How do you know ? " The boy 's eyes darted . " You can see the reflection in the window , " he mumbled . It was true enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vessels behind them ... were n't Venice-built . She 'd swear to that . Whoever made them needed lessons in shipbuilding . Tubs . But tubs bright with steel . So much so that it was a miracle they did n't tip over . That would 've emptied all the armored men , in bright triple-cross-enameled breastplates and their gilt-trimmed helmets , into the canal . Benito and Katerina gaped , forgetting the watcher on the balcony . The Teutonic Knights of the Holy Trinity . The fabled Arm Militant of the Pauline Orders . The soldiers of God who beat back the Huns , the Norse and the various Slavic and Magyar pagans and heretics on the northern and eastern frontiers of Christendom . The borders of Emperor Charles Fredrik 's Holy Roman Empire rested squarely on their steel shoulders . Those breastplates were unmistakable , a legend across the Christian world . And they were half feared , as well as admired and respected , by the southern and Mediterranean folk who generally followed the Petrine currents in the Church . " What the hell are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kat . His voice had more admiration in it than Katerina Montescue would have voiced . " Going to the Imperial embassy , by the looks of it , " said Katerina with relief . Benito too sounded more relaxed . " I always wanted to be a Knight . " Katerina shook her head . " Fighting trolls and hellspawn in the frozen northlands ? Dealing with pagan Russian and Tatar princes and their demons ? And-even worse-the heretic Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Hungary and their sorcerers and shamans ? Ha ! It 's dark half the year up there . And they look silly in that armor . It 's no good anyway . One of the new pistols from Spain will put a ball right through it . Besides , they take the sons of the nobility of the empire , not canal-brats . " The boy looked militant . " I 'm more than just a canal-brat . ' My father ... " " Was the Holy Grand Metropolitan of Rome himself , " snapped Katerina . " And your mother was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spare time . Now shut up . They still would n't be pleased to find us here . The Schiopettieri would run us in and beat us up just for being in this part of town . " The boy bit his lip . His dark eyes fumed at her . But he lay still . Katerina turned her attention back to the pageant reflected in the windows of the Casa Brunelli . With shock she recognized the file of gray cassocked and hooded men filing out of the embassy onto the stone-faced landing . Even in the poor light there was no mistaking the white triple crosses on the backs of those cassocks . The monastic Servants of the Holy Trinity did not inspire the same awe as their sibling Paulines , the Knights , did . They simply inspired fear and distrust . Especially for Katerina Montescue . And they were n't an unfamiliar sight in Venice . Their war on the Jews and the Strega was not officially sanctioned by the doge . On the other hand , Doge Giorgio Foscari was turning a very blind eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to Heaven than earth anyway . And the Servants claimed to be the custodians of the keys to Heaven . Kat suppressed a chuckle . That had gotten Metropolitan Michael very steamed up in the pulpit last Mass . Rome and the Holy Grand Metropolitan did not approve of the strident claims of the Paulines . A querulous , elderly whiny voice sounded across the canal . It rose above the soft sonorous sound of the plainsong that the Servants of the Holy Trinity were beginning to chant . " My best cassock . I wanted to wear it for this occasion ... " Someone hastily hushed the old monk as the boatloads of Knights drew up to the quay . A trumpet sounded , sharp and bright . Steel-clad figures disembarked from the boat and came up the steps . They were in military array , formed up around a palanquinlike structure which was borne by several of the hefty knights . It was plainly heavy , but too small to hold a person . " What are they carrying ? " whispered Benito . " How in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " Katerina hissed savagely . " Do you want me to go over and ask them ? " Benito sniffed . " There 's no need to bite my head off . It 's just that it looked like a chest . There were big locks . Maybe it is treasure . " There was a thoughtfulness in that young voice that made Katerina catch her breath and shake her head . This boy was going to die young . " Are you crazy ? Do n't even think of stealing from them . Do n't even think of it . " Two figures now left the tail of the procession . One was a gray-cassocked and stooped monk . The other was a woman . True , she wore a nun 's habit . But she walked like a duchess . Her head held up with an arrogant tilt that revealed a silhouetted prow of an aristocratic nose . " Sister Humility , " whispered the incorrigible canal-brat next to her . Katerina had to bite back a snort of laughter . Then , when she realized what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about laughing . They were getting into a small gondola with a single arquebus-armed Schiopettieri . A knight carried a small brazier over to the vessel . Another brought a box from their ship . Katerina knew enough of magical practice to guess that they were about to conduct a rite of enclosure . They could hardly fail to pass her gondola . Heaven alone knew what was inside the parcel from Ascalon that she was supposed to deliver . But having it inside a magical circle of enclosure was not a good idea . She pulled the cord , and the slipknotted parcel went down to the mud . Benito had plainly also seen what was happening . " Over the side . Quick ! " Katerina shook her head . " I ca n't swim . " " You do n't have to , " Benito snapped impatiently . " You can hold onto the boat . Come on . Be quick and quiet about it . They 'll be here any minute . " Continues ...            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
