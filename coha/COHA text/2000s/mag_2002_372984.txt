The formula is a hit for Law &; Order : rip a legal case from the headlines and make it into drama . Now two reality series , NBC 's Crime &; Punishment and ABC 's State V. , are cutting out the middleman and giving us the headlines straight from the courtroom . <P> Crime ( Sundays , 10 p.m . E.T. ) , from L &O; producer Dick Wolf , borrows not just L &O's; cha-chung ! sound between scenes but also its pro-prosecution bent . Made in cooperation with San Diego prosecutors , it finds raw drama in cases of murder and child molestation ; after one verdict , a courtroom melee breaks out . As reality TV , it 's riveting , addictive and well told . As a civics lesson , it 's manipulative and tendentious . We have access only to the D.A.s , so the presumption of innocence , unpopular with crime-show viewers anyway , gets 86ed , and every emotional cue prods us to root for " guilty "  --  even the show 's title . You do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up its cameras in the opposite camp , with Arizona defense lawyers , but it also gives airtime to prosecutors and , most important , jurors . It 's a bit stiffer than Crime , with conventional news narration by Cynthia McFadden , but it 's as interesting and better balanced . And it will almost certainly do worse in the ratings . Why ? It 's on Wednesdays at 10 p.m . E.T .  --  opposite Law &; Order . And Americans will take a fictional prosecution , even in reruns , over a real defense any day .  --  By James Poniewozik
