She never truly hated her father until that night . It began as the others had . The voices awakened her around midnight . She buried her face under the pillow but the voices found her . <p> <p> " You stupid cow . You 're so dumb , you still do n't know how to do it right , do ya ? Do you ? " <p> <p> A loud slap . " Paul , please . " <p> <p> The light from the kitchen intruded into her room , highlighting her small three- drawer dresser covered with Snow White and Cinderella stickers . She wished her bedroom had a door . She would close it to shut out the sounds . The screams were the worst . <p> <p> " Paul , please , " her father 's voice mocked her mother 's plea . " I 'm sick of your whining . Shut up ! " More scuffling , another slap . " No ? OK , I got a better idea . " <p> <p> The little girl raised her head from under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wished she could climb out and go far away . Her eyes closed and she was walking with her mother in the warm night . A shiny car stopped , and a tall , handsome man with a kind voice asked her if she and her mother would like to go away with him . He said her mother was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen . <p> <p> He stepped out , took her and her mother 's hands , and helped them into the car , and they drove away with the handsome man . She did not know where they were going , but it would be far away and they would be forever happy . <p> <p> " Oh , Paul , it hurts so much , please . Please . Oh ! God ! God , help me . I ca n't stand it . " <p> <p> The child slipped out of bed , tiptoed to the doorway , and peered into the kitchen . She saw her mother lying on her back on the linoleum floor she had waxed earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her father sat on top of her , his hand up her skirt . She knew where her father 's hand was . <p> <p> She stood staring at her mother and father . Her mother lay between the radiator and the refrigerator , one shoe on , one lying under the small kitchen table . Her blouse was torn , and she could see one of her mother 's nipples . Her left eye was swollen , and the rest of her face was red and wet from tears . Her father 's hand was over her mother 's mouth . <p> <p> She smelled her father 's sweat and whiskey . He was probably already drunk when he got home . When he was like that she wished he would go away and never come back . But he was her father and she was ashamed of those thoughts . <p> <p> " You bit me . You bitch ! " her father screamed . He pulled his hand away from her mother 's mouth , and blood trickled from the side of his index finger . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father pulled his other hand from her mother 's skirt and slapped her hard . A wine bottle rolled out from under her , and her mother 's legs sent it clattering across the floor . It came to rest at her feet , and she stared down at it . <p> <p> Her mother suddenly came to life , arched her back , and rolled her father off . Her knee shot into his groin , and she started to get up . Bellowing with pain and rage , her father grabbed an ankle . <p> <p> She watched her father drag her mother until he could get his hands on her throat . He began choking her and banging her head against the floor . She tried to slide away and got as far as the radiator . Again he grabbed her and pounded her head against the edge of the radiator . Blood gushed and formed a small pool on the floor . <p> <p> She rushed to her mother , who lay still , the color draining slowly from her face . <p> <p> A blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father stood over her . " You get in your bed now , Tookie ! You hear me ? Now ! You say one thing  --  one thing and you 'll get the same thing your mother just got . Now get in there ! " <p> <p> Never taking her eyes off her father , she slid across the kitchen floor to her bedroom . When she reached her room , she grabbed two of her dolls and dropped on the bed , sobbing . <p> <p> Through the doorway she could see her father leaning and swaying over her mother 's body . She watched him feel her wrist with his fingers . He stood over her mother , weaving , sucking on the knuckle of his finger . His eyes seemed to be everywhere , and then she saw him look toward her room . She was afraid and closed her eyes and made believe she was asleep . <p> <p> " Tookie , wake up , sweetheart . Daddy wants to talk to you . " <p> <p> She moaned and stirred . <p> <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> She opened her eyes and looked straight into her father 's bloodshot eyes . They always bulged , and they scared her . She squirmed and tried to turn away from him but he held her fast . The hard bristle of his unshaven face scratched her cheek . The mole behind his ear brushed against her neck . The mole was big and hairy , and she hated it . She wanted to be free , to go to her mother . But he held her face next to his . <p> <p> " Tookie ? " <p> <p> She hated that stupid name he called her . Her mother called her Lucky . Her lucky charm . She liked that . <p> <p> " I want you to listen to me , sweetheart . Daddy 's gon na call the police and tell them about Mommy . They 'll come over here in a little while and talk with me , and they 'll talk with you , too . Now here 's what happened , and here 's what we 're gon na tell the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen . We had a little argument , and Mommy got mad and hit Daddy in the face . Then Daddy hit Mommy back , first in the face and then here . " He touched her breast . <p> <p> " Then Daddy hit Mommy once in the eye . You were standing in your doorway and you saw it . Mommy saw you and jumped up to go to you to put you to bed . She slipped on the magazine on the floor and fell . When she fell , she hit her head on the radiator , and it got cut open . That 's what happened , sweetheart , and that 's what we 're goin ' to tell the men when they come over to talk with us . " <p> <p> She wanted to get away from him , wanted to be out the window with her mother and the handsome man . But he held her arms hard , smiling and nodding . Her arms hurt and she hated looking at his ugly gold tooth . <p> <p> " But , Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he hit her , she knew it was coming . She closed her eyes and felt the pain as his open hand smacked across her face . Tears filled her eyes , but she was afraid to open them . <p> <p> " Now you listen to me and you listen good . You 're gon na tell me exactly what I just told you , or you 'll get a lot worse than you just got . You hear me ? " <p> <p> She opened her eyes . He was still holding her by the arms , his eyes bigger than she had ever seen them . Traces of spit trickled down the sides of his mouth . She stared and nodded her head slowly . <p> <p> " That 's better . Now you tell me what happened . " <p> <p> She slowly , haltingly repeated the story . <p> <p> His face softened , and the grip on her arms relaxed . " That 's a good girl , sweetheart . Now let 's do it a couple more times just to be sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . Each time she told it more convincingly . <p> <p> " Oh , that 's my girl , sweetheart . Daddy 's gon na take good care of you . " <p> <p> She closed her eyes again , but the smells of her father were making her sick . She struggled to hold back the vomit in her throat as his hands touched her where they always did . <p> <p> " Now , Tookie , I 'm going to call the police and tell them about the accident , and they 'll be comin ' over soon . You stay in bed . They will probably want to talk with you after they talk to me . You be sure and tell them just what you and me went over together , right ? " <p> <p> She nodded . Her father went back to the kitchen and she lay in bed , hugging her dolls , trying not to cry . <p> <p> She listened to his movements and sounds and crept out of bed and peeked into the kitchen , watching him . He picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashed it in the trash can . Then he pressed a magazine hard against her mother 's bare foot and placed the magazine near the radiator . He picked up her mother 's shoe from the far side of the room , put it under one of the kitchen chairs , removed the other shoe and set it next to the one under the chair . With a damp paper towel , he washed off traces of blood between her legs and inner thighs . He tore her stained panties into shreds and flushed them along with the paper towel down the toilet . <p> <p> Her father stood hunched in the middle of the kitchen . He poured some more whiskey , drank it , picked up the phone , and called the police . <p> <p> Tookie heard him tell the policeman there 'd been an accident . She wiped her nose and eyes with the sleeve of her nightie and watched her father as he hung up and sat at the kitchen table . She wanted to go to her mother again , but she was afraid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep when the doorbell rang . Her clock said ten minutes after one . <p> <p> " Mr. Gale ? I 'm Detective David McNally , and this is Officer Gamache . " <p> <p> " Yeah . Come in . Come in . " Gale fumbled in his shirt pocket for a cigarette and clumsily worked the pack out . <p> <p> Tookie could see the two policemen standing in the middle of the kitchen looking at her mother 's body sprawled across the floor . The man in the jacket knelt and felt her wrist , at the same time looking at her puffed eye . " I 'm afraid she is dead , sir . " He rose and faced her father . <p> <p> When she heard the man say her mother was dead , she buried her head under the pillow . She did n't want to see or hear any more . <p> <p> Gale flicked the sweat from his forehead , never taking his eyes off McNally . He 'd dealt with cops before , and he knew he would have to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirties , good-looking , even seemed kind of gentlemanly . Not like other cops he had known . Nice leather jacket , white turtleneck . But cops could fool you . The guy 's handsome face showed an intelligence that unsettled him . <p> <p> " Can I use your phone , sir ? " <p> <p> Gale nodded . <p> <p> " Hello . McNally here . The lady 's dead . Get the medical examiner over here and the state police and the photographer . " He hung up and looked over at the body again . " Mr. Gale , could we go sit down in the other room ? I 'd appreciate it if you could tell us what happened . I 'm sorry . I know this is difficult for you . " <p> <p> " Sure , sure . That 's OK . I understand . I ... I ... " Gale sobbed and swallowed hard , closing his eyes . <p> <p> McNally and Gamache glanced at each other and back to Gale . " Thank you , sir , " McNally said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into the small living room off the kitchen , sparsely furnished with a floral- print couch and a worn armchair facing a TV set . He snapped on the overhead light . Still holding his crumpled pack of cigarettes , he pulled one out and held the pack out to the two cops . " Cigarette ? " <p> <p> They declined . <p> <p> McNally made Gale uneasy , but there was something about Gamache that he just did n't like . He looked like all cops : cocky , big-shot attitude . Blue uniform stretched across his fat belly , gun and nightstick hanging off him . <p> <p> " Mr. Gale , can you tell me what happened here to night ? " McNally asked , a gentle friendliness in his voice . <p> <p> Gale was careful . He knew cops too well . They were just like those pricks in the Merchant Marine . You get in a little trouble and they suck you in by making you think they care about you , being nice to you . Then just when you start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> He had told the investigating officer in the Merchants why he had beaten the woman in Madrid . He trusted him and thought he would understand . Before he knew it , they had kicked him out , telling him he was lucky he was n't going to jail . Now he had to deal with these two fucks . <p> <p> " I came home from work about midnight , Officer . I worked late , and then I stopped for a few beers . My wife likes to wait up for me if I 'm late . She was sittin ' at the kitchen table , sleepin ' . When I come in she woke up in a bad mood . She was pissed at me for comin ' home so late without callin ' , you know ? " He nodded at the officers but got no response . <p> <p> " Anyway , I tried to ignore her . I poured myself a little nightcap and suggested we go to bed . But she kept at me , gettin ' herself all worked up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magazine at me . Then , all of a sudden , she sucker punches me in the face . I 'm caught by surprise , and I hit her back , first in the chest and then the face . I mean , hey , she really belted me . <p> <p> " Then I look up and I see my little girl standin ' in the doorway . Sarah , my wife , saw her too and jumped up from the table to put her back to bed . She slipped on the magazine on the floor and fell backwards and hit her head on the radiator . That was it . It all happened so fast . Her head hit that radiator and she started bleeding like a pig . " He ground the cigarette out and looked back at the officers . <p> <p> Both men stared at Gale . He squirmed , crossed and uncrossed his legs . For Christ sake , say something , you assholes . <p> <p> Finally McNally spoke . " Mr. Gale , how long had your daughter been standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess . I noticed her right after I hit her mother the second time . She sort of whimpered , and when my wife saw her , she jumped up to go to her , to put her back to bed . That 's when she slipped on the magazine . " <p> <p> McNally glanced at Gamache . " What happened then ? " asked Mc-Nally . <p> <p> " Well , I run over to her , and so did my daughter . Sarah was moaning and bleeding from her head where she hit the radiator . I could tell from the gash in her head and from the blood that she was hurt bad . A few seconds after I got to her , she stopped moaning and passed out . " <p> <p> " Passed out ? " <p> <p> " Yeah . Her eyes kinda rolled back and her head slipped to the side , and she was gone . " <p> <p> " What do you mean , gone ? " <p> <p> " I mean she was dead . " <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out or something ? " <p> <p> " No , I seen dead people before , when I was in the Merchant Marine . I knew she was dead . " <p> <p> " What did your daughter do ? " <p> <p> " She ran to her mother . When she saw the blood she started screaming . " <p> <p> " And then ? " <p> <p> " Well , I did n't know what to deal with first . My wife is layin ' dead on the floor , and my kid 's hysterical . I picked my daughter up and carried her into bed , calmed her down , and told her I 'd take care of Mommy . Then I went back to Sarah and felt her pulse . I could n't feel none , and that 's when I called you . " <p> <p> McNally nodded . His eyes never left Gale . <p> <p> Gale wanted a drink . <p> <p> " Mr. Gale , can we go back into the kitchen ? " <p> <p> Gale was tired . He wanted Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted to go to bed . " Sure . " <p> <p> The investigative unit arrived and went to work . The photographers began taking pictures while the medical examiner worked with the body , and a technician videotaped the death scene . A paramedic sat at the kitchen table filling out forms . <p> <p> Gamache sat next to the paramedic . McNally and Paul Gale stood in the middle of the room . Gale watched the crowd of people taking over his kitchen like they owned it and wanted them the fuck out of his house . He started to say something but McNally interrupted him . " Mr. Gale , can you describe for me just how your wife stepped on the magazine and how she fell ? Could you show me how it happened ? Walk me through it ? " <p> <p> " Look , Officer , what do you want from me ? I mean , my wife is layin ' dead in front of me . It 's one- thirty in the morning . My eight-year- old daughter 's in there , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my kitchen , and I 'm dead tired . I been through a lot to night . I just do n't want to talk no more . " His voice broke , and he closed his eyes . <p> <p> McNally covered his face with his hands and rubbed his eyes . <p> <p> " Uh , Dave . " <p> <p> When McNally looked up , Gamache was standing by the little girl 's bedroom . She stood in the doorway , her eyes red , tears trickling down her cheeks . <p> <p> McNally looked at Gale . " Your call , Mr. Gale . Do we talk to her now ? " <p> <p> Gale looked at his daughter . Their eyes locked . He nodded his head slowly , and she nodded back . <p> <p> McNally looked from Gale to the little girl . <p> <p> Her eyes remained transfixed on her father . <p> <p> " Sweetheart , Mr. McNally would like to talk with you for a minute . Can you come out and sit down ? " <p> <p> Tookie stared at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she knew she could do it . She walked into the kitchen and looked around for the first time . <p> <p> She saw her mother lying on the floor . The policeman standing by her bedroom smiled at her . She could see the window in her bedroom , and she wished she could float through it again . Suddenly the handsome man was in her house , standing in the kitchen , smiling at her . She looked back at him , and she knew that everything was going to be all right . <p> <p> He smiled again , and he spoke . " Honey , can you tell us what happened here to night ? Can you ? " The handsome man 's voice was soft like her mother 's . <p> <p> The little girl stared straight ahead . " My father did it . My father killed my mommy .
