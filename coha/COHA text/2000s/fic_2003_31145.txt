Chapter One : About the Author Memory passes below , like clouds over the earth , the winking lights of cities . Florida slipping into the color of oceans ; the little figure eight near the shore of the green peninsula , double loop of seven asterisks , like stars drawn by some childish hand . Small stars full of lives , lives full of those small stars that make up a life : the taste of wallpaper , cornflower blue , patterned like a woman 's dress in the slender hall between kitchen and living room ; the iron crust of water beneath a sink ; oily linoleum slipping and burning against my knees  --  a playland for trucks without the endless snagging and unsnagging of wheels from shiny loops of nylon carpet . A world of carpet  --  or so I imagined the moon , mirror of earthly lands : beige , woolly , resilient . One day my father would inform me , voice full of space and static , of how the moon is in fact stony , dusty , brilliant bright  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the bleary sound of the radio above the stove instead of his voice . My father had landed , we were told , and was taking turns with his fellow traveler , looking out the window of the lunar module . I was kneeling , rolling a silver moon buggy from the hall onto the linoleum , looking up at my mother . She wore a long white nurse 's coat , as she did every day . Behind her , the sky out the kitchen window had the bloodless look of full-on July . She yanked at her gloves , beckoned , and stooped to pick my shoes out from under the chair by the front door . She was going to be late . My father was placing his foot upon an astronomical body , like a god mounting a tiny silver throne , but she would be late for work , because the baby-sitter was sick and would n't be coming this morning . Taking my hand , she led me down the tobacco-stained hall of the fourth floor to the elevator , where an elderly couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rippling upon their Hawaiian lapels , had taken up residence several weeks ago , graciously pushing the buttons for passengers even though the elevator was fully automated . They were the tip of a great iceberg of fans and enthusiasts who 'd traveled from near and far to be near us during my father 's odyssey , and had erected lawn chairs around a small table set with a red Thermos and two plastic cups of lemonade . " It 's a scorcher out there , " Mr. Stern said , clasping his paper to his chest so we might squeeze inside . My mother adjusted her sunglasses . " You 're looking especially glamorous this morning , Mrs. Finch , " he added , and his wife , reaching into her purse , said , " You must be so excited , Georgie , " handing me a worn scrap of candy . I 'd met the Sterns before , but today their eyes burned as if in each of us they recognized a secret grandchild . The candy had the metallic taste of fear , and when the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep a secret , Georgie ? " I hid in the folds of my mother 's coat , trying to focus all my attention on the shiny moon buggy I still held in one hand . I knew that outside there would be cameras , an atmosphere of carnival and balloons , where my name would be repeated until it lost all meaning . My mother , for her part , only smiled . " Thank you , " she said , her thank-yous generous , conscious of their public like queens , though at this moment she felt only beleaguered . If she considered asking these people to watch me for the afternoon  --  there was no doubt they 'd have agreed  --  she did so only as one revolves any number of familiar and flawed endgame options : the Sterns belonged to that broad category we loosely term fanatics ; it would be like giving her child to gypsies . Pursing her lips , she recalled Doris Fitzpatrick 's voice on the phone this morning  --  the voice that had begun this series of revolutions , even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " my mother had broken in , noting that this would be the third day running . " She was fine last night  --  we thought she was fixed , " the woman chirped into the frustrated pause . " Have you heard your husband 's landed ? On the moon , I mean . I do hope they 're OK with everything . " My mother shuddered once more , now , at the thought of these men paddling around in their space suits , playing golf  --  the ridiculous pretenses of normalcy they would set up in their oxygenless world ; and then we emerged from the elevator , and saw the crowd beyond the smoked glass doors of the lobby . Just inside , Lyle Barnes , Uncle Lyle , as I called him , handsome as a cereal-box hero , was lounging in a suit , chatting with a security guard . He turned his boyish eyes  --  blue with the slightest tremble  --  upon us , saying , " It 's great , great , bringing the spud with you to work  --  bravo , Barb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PBS , the Post , the Times "  --  he counted them back to himself , glanced toward the doors , where the crowd , catching sight of us , pressed forward like a wet nose against the glass . " It 's a rodeo out there . " " Lyle , " my mother said quietly , " I do n't want to talk to anyone now , do you understand ? I can not talk to anyone . " He paused a moment , moving his square jaw from side to side , realigning himself behind this proposition . " Sure  --  absolutely "  --  he nodded  --  " I understand completely . " But , pushing through the doors , he seemed to rethink matters . Glancing around , he said , " We have to give them something , Barb . Should I say this evening ? Should I offer CBS the exclusive ? " until he saw the firm set of her mouth and turned sadly back . The guard squeezed outside . Police were there already , shaping the mass of people , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father as they gazed through the glass , was ferocious , like an animal snapping at a reflection ; years later I would recognize a perhaps truer likeness in the desperate clinging of a newborn chimp to a terry cloth-wrapped mannequin . As the doors hinged open all the way , and the light and heat and noise poured over us , I was sick on the worn , pink tiles of the lobby , in the smiling eye of the crowd . The moon buggy slipped from my hand and careened across the floor to come to rest against one of my mother 's heels . I watched myself as if from above as Lyle bent to retrieve the fallen vehicle , the crowd made its distant roar , and my mother , giving me a handkerchief from her pocket , hauled me out by the arm into the light . *** In the safety of her car , Barbara Finch took off her sunglasses . Beneath the brown bob of the day , she had , you might remember from newspapers or television , one of those angular faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at all , you 've confused her with Jackie Onassis in your shoe box of memories ; but perhaps you also remember , from those few public photos of my mother without sunglasses , that she had a wandering right eye . She was quite vain about it , and the gesture of removing her dark glasses and revealing that pale face with its single defect always had the quality of an admission . " I suppose you have what Angie has , " she said , pulling out of the parking lot . My mother probably had little conception of the state into which I 'd been plunged , only moments ago , confronted with that wild , unseeing crowd ; she was  --  and is  --  a fearless person , much more so than her husband the astronaut . Noticing , however , that I was still turned , staring back behind us for signs of pursuit , she added , " They love this , do n't they ? There 's really nothing they 'd rather do . " At the corner traffic light she gazed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But then again , if your father did n't exist , Georgie , someone would have to invent him . " People make such pronouncements all the time , on subjects ranging from hairpins to divinity . I recognized in these words , nonetheless , a parody of my father 's own , and suspected that she , too , was thinking now of the night of the parent-teacher conference , one week before Jerry Finch wrote his entry for the astronaut contest , months before his name would be announced in the newspapers , nearly a year before this day , the day the lunar module touched down in a cloud of pulverized glass and rock . You 've probably forgotten Jerry Finch . He was n't among the famous astronauts , and really , in every respect except the one , crucial point of traveling above and beyond the earth 's atmosphere , of walking the surface of the moon , my father was n't an astronaut at all . Until that summer he left the world behind he was an earth science teacher in central Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashtrakan or the Greater Titusville area , you might have seen him : a deliberator at the register at McDonald 's , a collector of National Geographics at yard sales , a passable swimmer at the local YMCA , and , what is less known , an amateur bird-watcher , populating my earliest memories with impressions of tall grass , ourselves crouching within the still heart of the world , binoculars in hand , following with infinite voyeuristic care the distant domestic scene of a creature the size of a heart . But you do at least remember the year  --  1975 , nearly twelve months before his voyage  --  when our elected officials gathered in our televisions to concede that the space program was errant , had forgotten its roots . My mother , seated between my father and me that evening , was putting on her shoes for parent-teacher night , paying little attention , but her brows arched perceptibly , as if what had been implied by this concession was that the astronauts had departed forgetting their lunch . She did n't realize at what future cost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trusted representatives , for their part , were as yet blind to my mother , even as she rose , terrifying , to turn off the television . My father , on this occasion , stayed her hand , and for a moment we listened together to the sentiments of our president , that great man of words . His logic was deductive , potent : after all , he reminded us , strip away from the Apollo space program the glamour , the secrecy ; strip away the military-scientific complex ; yes , strip away even the spaceships  --  and what is space travel about ? People , surely . People , like you and me . The president hesitated , mouth modest , eyes dreamy , because for this one moment of his brief term , the representatives of our nation had laid aside partisanship and tendered to him their loyalty and trust . They may have tendered these things as children do , or perhaps , as my mother pointed out , as devious men of politics tender all wares  --  this was immaterial . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if each senator , as the curtain went down on the Vietnam Era , as the oil crisis hovered in the wings of the decade , took advantage of this caesura to kindle a butane lighter to a single cause . And even if there was no such stadium drama , and the decision arose through a simple counting of votes , a weary shaking of hands , the outcome was the same : the thing to do , clearly , was send an ordinary man to the moon . I think by " ordinary , " our representatives imagined someone a lot like my father but made of some solid , wholesome fiber , like flame-retardant pajamas . A write-in contest appeared in major magazines , and I remember him reading his entry aloud to us one night  --  the scorn with which my mother received his suggestion that the moon might have something to teach us . " The moon , " she said , " is a veritable palace of idiots . " My father , drawing his onion-shaped head further into his collar , persevered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did . His essay was entitled " Gentlemen of Space " and would be reprinted in every major paper in the country . " Gentlemen of Space , " in its quiet way , has become a modern classic of the middle school civics class , no doubt because whatever my father wanted for himself , this man who wrote in " Gentlemen " of the beautiful things he 'd bring back from the moon , it 's clear he 'd grasped , even seated there amidst his family , in the comfort of his Florida living room , that people prefer to love their fugitives . They crave human astronauts , not hard , hairless men with weathered faces , those faces with weathers so strange and distant only other astronauts can understand . In the closing remarks of his essay , my father vowed to humanize space ; and in retrospect , arguably , he did . My father , with his small chin and broad hips  --  he would appear as incongruous on the moon as any ordinary man . Visitors to our home who 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall of his face frozen behind the curved glass of his visor . They sat in his yellow chair , worn in the seat from years of service ; they noted the deposit of gray hairs on the fabric ; and the visitors , understanding only so much , knew my father , then , as a fellow traveler . If they grew strident and indignant when they next spoke , if the country as a whole would forget at times that space had been not imposed on him but chosen , it was because they felt for him not as an astronaut but as a human being . Glancing back with my mother to that distant parent-teacher night , however , I see this was all just beginning . The October dark smelled of gasoline as we drove across suburban Ashtrakan 's palm-lined avenues in our Country Squire , the yellow butt of the car hanging low above the ground , a rash of fumes condensing behind us beneath the streetlamps . My father was driving , one hand on the wheel , the other sifting slowly through the woolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passing cars . He 'd been preoccupied ever since the announcement of the astronaut contest a few hours ago , but his brown eyes , until then loitering upon the road , suddenly reflected back at me . " Do you know where we 're going ? " he asked , a slyness in his voice . " The secret night school , " I replied . He winked . " That 's right . Your mother does n't know that yet  --  " " Oh , I 've heard all about it , thank you  --  " " Or at least she does n't really know , " my father added , speaking in his " old cowboy " voice culled from Westerns . " Barbara , I do n't recall seeing you at the secret night school before . " " I was too busy making the secret night dinner for the secret night husband . " He gave my mother a crestfallen glance , and she reached and took his hand out of his hair . Stealing a look in the mirror again , he winked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherited from my father 's own childhood mythology . I did n't believe in it , the way he once truly had , but I do n't think he wanted me to  --  he wanted us to laugh with him , at himself and this invention of his earliest years . For he 'd believed for a long time that there really was a secret school the other kids went to after dark , when he was in bed . It was here that everyone learned the answers not to the ordinary questions that could be handled in a multiple-choice fashion  --  state capitals , spelling , arithmetic  --  but to the true questions : who to pick for your team , which movies were destined for popularity , how to address girls  --  all those impossible distinctions everyone else seemed to divine automatically . He was , I see now , the kind of man who often impressed his students as a well-meaning crank . His hair , despite my mother 's best efforts , rose in a peppery fountain as if from some youthful trauma . He had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a blue felt-tip drawing of a watch on his wrist at the moment , left over from some classroom science demonstration . Twiddling with the dial on the car radio , from which the word moon gently and periodically lowed , my mother said , " Why this fuss all of a sudden about the moon ? We 've been to the moon , and there was nothing there . " It was a question my father was frequently forced to counter over the next months , and to which he never grew accustomed . He could only marvel that anyone , given the same chance as himself , would n't do the same . " Barbara , it 's not like a trip to Dallas . It 's  --  well , it 's hardly a place at all . It 's like being allowed to speak with the dead . " She looked at him with distaste , and he stuttered , " Just think of it . Any person who 's ever walked the earth  --  if you could talk to anyone , who would it be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgotten , was a hospice care nurse and from her slender stock of romantic notions had long since excised anything related to death or dying . She said , " I do n't want to meet any dead people , Jerry . " With a baroque rattling , the car turned a corner at this point , and ahead , limp above the avenue , trembling in the fronds of the palms , was the controversial satellite . " But just look at it , " he said , brown eyes flickering between the moon and the road . " It nourishes us , I think . It 's as necessary as mother 's milk "  --  intercepting my mother 's protest  --  " because if the moon did n't exist , " my father insisted , a satisfaction entering his eye now , " we would have to invent it . " There was a palpable silence in the car , ruminative or dismissive , as you will . " Can you imagine the night sky without the moon , day after day ? We 'd go mad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand over it so we 'd see what he meant . " And it 's just sitting there . It 's a whole continent , waiting for us . " Do you know  --  do you know , " he continued , noticing he was speeding up , " when Jim and Kay  --  Jay and Kim  --  came back from their vacation  --  " My mother 's gaze focused for a moment . She smiled . " Georgie , " she asked in the mirror , " when was the last time we went on a vacation ? " It 's the look I associate with her  --  this pained amusement . If one could lay claim to such a thing , she could certainly be said to own it . It washed in and out of her face , gone the next moment as she turned around in her seat , wet her thumb , and adjusted my hair . Behind her , the school loomed like a toy prison , and then we were pulling into the parking lot . Parents milled on the front steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in a red sarong  --  I recognized her as a classmate 's mother , Kitty Shank  --  touched my mother 's shoulder at the door , and for a moment the two women confabulated . There were n't many other children around , but Mr. Rectin had especially asked my parents to bring me , which did n't bode well  --  like the crowd . Whenever there was a crowd outside in warm weather , it meant the air-conditioning was down ; and , sure enough , inside it was a greenhouse . Adults in the halls said hello because my father taught middle sections here  --  his parent-teacher night would be next week . He ambled from friendly face to friendly face , stopping to pick a crumpled piece of paper off the floor , as if he were in his own home . Mr. Rectin , two damp patches under the arms of his shirt , was standing at the darkened windows when we came into my classroom . He was middle-aged and fond of sweater-vests , and with his wife , Kim , would sometimes go bowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barb , " he said , coming forward , " sorry about the heat . " Everyone shook hands . My mother gazed around the room with its party-colored pictures and letters spelling out things like " Congratulations " and " Welcome Back , " and then my father sat down , patting the knees of his pants . " Before we start , Jay , I want to know what you think about something . " Probably sensing the turn the conversation was about to take , Barbara wandered toward the back of the room and the drawings the students had made during the first weeks of class . Mr. Rectin fussed with his papers and nodded . He had a small mustache with which he dusted his lower lip . " If you had the chance to go to the moon  --  " my father began . " We were just talking about that in the lounge . " Mr. Rectin smiled , sitting down on a desk as my mother rolled her eyes . " Yes , yes  --  but what did you think ? " my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaid sleeves . " Would you go ? " Jay Rectin picked up a pencil and was about to draw a parallel between lunar exploration and some famous historical moment , the way he would in class , bobbing the pencil up and down between thumb and forefinger . But he looked from my father to my mother , pressed too attentively toward the pictures on the back wall , and saw there was a disparity of views . He put the pencil behind his ear . His mustache nibbled . " Well , it does n't really matter  --  it 's not like they 're going to pick one of us . " " There , " my father said , turning to his wife . " He did n't say anything , " she protested . " But the point is you would go , " my father pressed as the man looked at my mother apologetically . " Thank you , Jay , " she said , her eyes trailing over the drawings on the wall . " Though I admit it would be a real kindness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course  --  if we might talk for a few minutes about Georgie . I presume there 's some reason you asked us to bring him here tonight ? " It 's true that the request for my presence there was remarkable : I was quiet , not given to raising trouble or even my voice . " Barbara , " Mr. Rectin remonstrated . She shot a glance across the room at the two men , slumped on the tiny children 's desks . " Georgie , " she said , " come show Mother your pictures . " The mustache lifted delicately and brought itself down . " Georgie 's pictures are n't up . " Clearing his throat he added , " I have them over here , Barb . I think you should have a look . " Mr. Rectin removed from his yellow briefcase a blue vinyl folder in which he kept his attendance rolls , and from this he extracted a handful of papers . He laid the drawings out on the desk , and it 's true there was something immediately striking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pleased , primarily , with my mastery of the conventions of realism : specific details , such as the upturned head of a dinosaur , its great eye rolled toward the sky as if staring at the viewer ; a whorl of hair upon my father 's own head , his binoculars like a capital H before his face ; the seven asterisks of the Magnolia complex scattered in their figure eight on a green field ; a blue and green sheet of water , with a man inside , silhouetted like a chalk outline as he swam or slept amongst aquarium fishes . My parents drew back before bending forward to inspect them more carefully , the silence in the room palpable . " They 're quite well done , " Mr. Rectin suggested , to which no one seemed willing to add anything until my mother said , " Georgie  --  why are they all drawn this way ? " Every image , you see , was drawn as if viewed from above , from a greater or lesser height  --  I did n't know why . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these pictures . Not that I doubted they were mine  --  I know they were . The adults waited briefly for a reply and then turned to one another . I remember the conversation falling around me , above me , like gray rain ; Mr. Rectin asking , " Does he have many friends outside of school ? Does he show affection ? " I felt myself fading into a set of abstract and anomalous behaviors , fixed to some impulse or action whose origin I did n't even recall . When I looked at my mother , I saw she thought my father was somehow to blame . We all , I think , saw that these were pictures drawn from a point of view that orbited , rather than rested upon , the earth . That my father had only on this very day voiced more than a passing fascination with things lunar did n't matter : we 'd sensed in him for months now a nascent fantasy life , a dreaminess that my mother recalled from his previous forays into crop circles and the language of whales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above a fault line , had registered the larger significance far in advance of human auditors . It was , she must have felt , as if I were channeling his manias  --  things invisible to us before tonight ; and it could only have seemed frightful and irrational that , before my father 's desires were even articulated , they would loom up here , inside me . " I think he spends too much time alone , " Mr. Rectin said . Someone murmured the word psychologist , and for a moment it bubbled around , my father following the whole thing with the habitual expression of panic he wore for practical situations . When my mother brought the conversation up short , at last , she placed her hand on my head , grown warm and perspiring brightly . " But it 's probably nothing , " she murmured . " Is n't it ? We can talk about psychology until we 're blue in the face , but it 's much simpler , I think  --  " Jay 's mustache quivered . " I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you , " my mother said , standing . " You did the right thing . " She could n't explain to this man that the root of the problem was in fact quite clear . Or perhaps she did n't have to . We all glanced at my father . He had the pictures in his hands still , marveling at the accuracy with which his own sparse yet electric hair was depicted ; and my mother was walking toward the door , turning and reaching back her hand to say something to him . She would explain to him that he was setting a poor example with his spongy , inarticulate fantasy life  --  that it could affect his students in the science classes ; that it was the kind of thing that acted subliminally , without anyone meaning anything . If he would just put away the idea , for a little while , of some cowboyish escapade in space  --  But she slipped just then and skidded on her feet . Looking down , thinking one of her heels had given out , she let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desks , and there on the tiles was a brown starfish the size of a hand , one of its appendages  --  probably the one just trod on  --  curling slowly back . " Damn it , " Mr. Rectin said , blushing as he stooped to retrieve the animal . " They do this whenever the air-conditioning fails . We have an aquarium full of stuff for the kids , and they just crawl out when it gets too hot ... " I came over and stared at the little creature , of whom I 'd never taken much notice in its tank beside the geraniums . It was harmless , blind with a vegetal life ; but my mother looked as if she 'd seen a ghost . *** I know there are those amongst you who might wonder at a grown man remembering so much of his early childhood , presuming at all to know the minds of his parents at so tender an age ; but imagine for a moment the story that overwhelmed my family , and you will understand that these events were part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst ourselves again and again . All the same , perhaps this is n't the place to begin . There are lives , like shoelaces , which require only a single strand to work themselves into complex , mathematical knots ; but my father 's is not such a life . There are strands here I can not touch yet  --  I do n't want to touch . So let 's start anew . Let us leap forward , out of the dark of that parent-teacher evening . And while we could return to the side of my mother , driving silently through the bright Ashtrakan morning  --  and we will again , soon ; I promise we will make good on all our false beginnings  --  let us now begin anew entirely : "  --  I can still perfectly picture North Court , like a mirage of light cast against the wall of my study : the sunburnt grass between the brick towers , the brightly colored lawn chairs ; the huffing , red faces with their white plastic visors , tipped up toward our window . " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and the phone would ring  --  " Let us begin , then , on this day , between the parents ' night and the morning of the moon landing . My father had risen long before us to go to the NASA training camp , and my mother would have gone to work . We were driving together with her a moment ago , and we will leave her in her car , alone now , as she goes to visit the dying . From the window , I 'd watched her depart , reflecting that every place she worked had the name of a person , or of people  --  the Roberts ' , Mrs. Morris 's , Mr. Osseau 's , the Ludens '  --  and when at that age I imagined her in these places with people 's names , I saw the name ghostly in a blue glass , like a set of teeth , bubbles striving over the enamel letters , the name growing deeper , more luminous , most perfect . It was already summer , and I was out of school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame , and the court contained just two or three local reporters and a handful of elderly , heatstroke-prone gentlemen hoping to point my father or a member of his family out to their grandchildren . Let us begin here , then , safely on earth , where we can breathe .
