Christmas , Hanukkah , and Kwanzaa " Me llamo A.J. y odio la escuela . " That 's " My name is A.J. and I hate school " in Spanish . Miss Holly translated it for me . She 's the Spanish teacher at Ella Mentry School . " It 's not fair , " I said as our class walked down the hall to the language lab . " Why do we have to learn a whole nother language ? " " ' Nother ' is n't a word , Arlo , " said Andrea Young . " You ca n't even speak English correctly . " Andrea is this girl in my class with curly brown hair who thinks she knows everything . She calls me by my real name because she knows I hate it . " ' Nother ' is too a word , " I told her . " Is not . " " Is too . " We went back and forth like that for a while . Andrea said she looked up " nother " in the dictionary once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid in the world who keeps a dictionary on her desk so she can look up words and show everybody how smart she is . " ' Another ' is a word , " Andrea said , " but not ' nother . ' " " Oh yeah ? " I said . " If ' nother ' is n't a word , then why did you just say it ? " Nah-nah-nah boo-boo on her . Andrea was wearing this dumb hat that she made all by herself in her knitting class . Andrea takes classes in everything . She probably even takes a classin how to be annoying , because that 's the one thing she 's good at . After walking a million hundred miles , we finally got to the language lab . What a dumb name . Labs are supposed to have test tubes and mad scientists and hunchbacked guys named Igor who limp . Our language lab is just a plain old room where we learn Spanish . What 's up with that ? " Is n't learning Spanish fun ? " Andrea said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaches us --  " She did n't get the chance to finish her sentence because at that very second Miss Holly danced in the door . Miss Holly was playing a guitar and she had a big basket of fruit on her head . She was singing some crazy song and spinning around and stamping her feet . Her red dress had pictures of reindeer on the back . On the front were blinking lights and the words " Happy Holidays ! " When she finished the song , Miss Holly yelled , " Olay ! " which is the name of the stuff my mom smears on her face at night . " Feliz Navidad ! " Miss Holly said . " Happy Hanukkah ! Kwanzaa Yenu Iwe Na Heri ! " " What the heck does that mean ? " I asked . " That means Merry Christmas , Happy Hanukkah , and Happy Kwanzaa ! " Miss Holly replied . " Which holiday do you celebrate ? " asked Emily . " Me ? " said Miss Holly . " I celebrate all of them ! " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about the holidays . I mean , we just came back to school from Thanksgiving break a few days ago . Miss Holly is too jolly . " I love all the holidays ! " Miss Holly said . " I ca n't wait for December ! " " My favorite holiday is Halloween , " said Neil , who everybody calls the nude kid , even though he wears clothes . " My favorite holiday is Thanksgiving , " said my friend Ryan , who will eat anything , even stuff that is not food . " My favorite holiday is my birthday , " said my other friend Michael , who never ties his shoes . Everybody started shouting out their favorite holiday . " What 's your favorite holiday , A.J. ? " Miss Holly asked me . " My favorite holiday is Take Our Daughters to Work Day , " I said . " That 's for girls , " Andrea said . " Why is that your favorite holiday , Arlo ? " " Because you 're not here , " I replied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms and wrinkled up her face . She was right . It was mean . That 's why I said it ! I hate her .
