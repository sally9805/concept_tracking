COYOTE LOVE KRAIG BLACKWELDER Denial can be very powerful : a woman pretends she has no knowledge of her spouse 's affair , a parent denies his child is taking drugs , a dying man refuses to believe he will not recover . Just how far can a person take this refusal of reality ? According to Kraig Blackwelder 's story , very far indeed . Yapping and howling from outside bit into his shallow sleep , and two grim realizations bled through . It was not a woman . That was the first shock to hit him as he lurched back to consciousness . It was a simple architectural recognition . The naked body next to his naked body under the soft down comforter in this strange bed in this strange room , the naked body that he was holding close to him with his right arm , the naked body that was on top of his left arm , which was numb , belonged to a hairy , muscular man who smelled like lime juice and gin and Obsession for Men . Only then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still drunk , though not so drunk that he did n't feel the dry mouth , the hint of headache , the nausea that told him that by noon he would have a bitch of a hangover . This could n't happen ; this event could not be allowed to happen ; he was in the Army , an Airborne Ranger , special-fucking-forces ; he was not allowed to wake up naked in bed with another man . Deep breath ( quietly ) . Exhale ( do n't wake him ) . The yapping that had woken him got louder again . There were a lot of three-legged coyotes around Tombstone and FortHuachuca , too dumb to avoid the trap but sharp enough to chew off the leg before the trapper showed up with a pistol . The noise was clearing his head . He remembered only the punctuation marks of the evening . He had made the drive from base to Tombstone , where he picked up Julie . She got pissed off at him when he did n't tell her how great she looked the moment she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party at the house of some weird friends of hers . They did not talk at the party . He fumed as she kept checking out the computer geek who was showing off his fancy laptop computer in the kitchen . As he watched her orbit farther and farther from him and closer and closer to the geek , he drank . He drank beer , he drank cheap wine from the cardboard box , he drank nauseous blue Midori straight from the bottle while a skinny chick in black , wearing black lipstick , watched him and grimaced . When he could no longer walk to the booze table , he stayed seated in a large red overstuffed chair that he could not seem to get out of . His head was spinning . He saw Julie leave with the geek . She did n't look in his direction when she passed him on her way out . The world seemed very far away , muted . He knew no one there . The chick in black motioned her friend over and pointed at his feet . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , worn his boots , and they were freshly polished . Her friend , a blonde in a red crushed-velvet dress , was idly playing her teeth like a marimba with the steel stud through her tongue . She furrowed her brow , stopped clacking her teeth , and said gravely , " If you want a picture of the future , imagine a boot stamping on a human faceforever . ' " She lifted the hem of her dress , revealing her own combat boots and mimed an enthusiastic face-crushing . " Every woman loves a fascist , ' " replied the woman in black , taking a drag from her clove cigarette . Drunk as he was , they were turning him on . He was trying to decide which one he wanted to fuck . They were both cuter than Julie . The woman in red slowly shook her head . " Plath is so done . She wandered to the booze table and tipped the box to drain the last of the wine . He wanted to say something flirtatious , but before anything came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caught up with her friend , who was now playing her dental marimba so enthusiastically he thought she 'd chip a tooth . No one else spoke to him for the next two hours as he sat in the plush red chair glaring out . He sat there , feeling as welcome as a rotten mouse floating in a fresh bottle of beer . He could not drive back to base this fucked up , and he did n't know where he would go after the party . He was afraid he was going to become a weepy drunk . After two hours of abandonment , he was abjectly grateful when someone came over and spoke to him . He remembered the nice blonde guy who said he looked like he needed a glass of water instead of a beer . He remembered the guy asking his name . He remembered the guy asking if he wanted to crash at his place . He remembered being very pleased with himself for being able to stand up . He remembered leaning on the guy 's shoulder in the cool night air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red Volkswagen Beetle . He remembered feeling revived by the cool air from the car 's open window as they drove to the blond guy 's house listening to old surf-guitar music . He remembered walking into the guy 's house and pardoning himself to vomit . He remembered nearly missing the toilet . He remembered the guy coming back from the kitchen and giving him orange slices to wash the taste of bile from his mouth . He remembered saying , " You are a very , very , very good person , " and meaning it . He remembered leaning on the guy as he pulled off his pants , nearly falling over as his underwear tangled around his ankles like a bolo . He remembered the soothing feeling of slipping between clean sheets with a warm body beside him . He remembered lying on his stomach , hearing the guy say , " Relax , I 'm playing it safe , " and feeling the warm weight of the guy pressing into him . He remembered that something he always thought would hurt , something he expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hurt . It did many things , had many alarming effects on his body , but , to his shame , the thing it did not do at all was hurt . He wished it had . And now he was awake in a strange room lit only by a red digital clock , with his numb left arm trapped under the naked body of the guy next to him under a soft down comforter . If he let the clock run to morning , if he let the guy wake up , if the day was allowed to take its natural course , if he did not escape by the time the guy whose naked body was next to his naked body , who was sleeping on his numb left arm , awoke to his Sunday morning house guest , then it would be a defining morning , and he would be lost . He knew a lot of ways to kill the guy . He could snap his neck . He could press his thumbs into the guy 's carotids for a few minutes . He could smash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . These were all things he had been trained to do . The guy was not the enemy , however , but a very , very , very nice guy . He 'd said so , not four hours ago . All he really needed to do was escape without waking the guy , without facing him , and he would be fine . He would go back to base , forget about the party , about Julie , and the rest of the weekend . He would nurse his hangover all day Sunday and be a normal soldier again by the time PT rolled around Monday morning . He just had to free himself first . This would have to be a stealth mission . He decided to chew off his arm . He changed his mind . He argued with himself , which he knew he ought not to do , since he was still drunk , and part of him was comfortable and wanted to go back to sleep , but the red clock said 6:28 and he did n't know if there might be an alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time the guy woke up . If he was still there , it 'd mean showers , eggs over easy with toast and coffee , formal introductions , small talk , acknowledgment of what they 'd done . He really wished it had n't not hurt . He liked his arm . He 'd worked out a lot of hours to get his arm like that , with the biceps looking like a baseball under his tanned skin . For a second he thought it would be worth being that way just to have both his arms , but then he heard his dad 's voice ; " Dammit , son , what 's the good of having two arms and muscles and looking tough and whatnot if y'ai n't a real man anyhow ? You 'd still know what you were . " And he would . His daddy 'd been a real hellraiser when he was young , then in ' 66 he signed up with the Marines and wound up losing an arm in ' Nam . Now he was a respected foreman at the Goodyear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , a man you could look up to . And that was that . He licked his lips and decided to do it . His grace period , when endorphins and shock would mute the pain , would last between fifteen and thirty minutes ; the military had taught him this . He would not bleed to death if he severed the brachial artery in one quick bite , because the artery , like rubber tubing , would snap back into the stub , bunching up in a mass , and would merely seep , not spurt , blood , and he could staunch that with a pressure bandage . The first bite did n't do anything but hurt and leave a perfect cast of his teeth in the valley between his biceps and his deltoid . The second bite drew blood where his canines punctured the skin . To keep it from twitching , he gripped his left arm with his right , nearly touching the guy 's back . The third bite was for keeps and hurt worse than when his brother had burned him with his lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worse than when he 'd burned his calf on the tailpipe of his motorcycle , worse than anything he 'd ever felt . Tears came to his eyes and again he almost changed his mind , but he bit down and his mouth filled with the taste of blood and he pulled his head from side to side to rip away a piece of his arm . He grimaced and let the gobbet fall from his mouth onto the designer sheets . The fourth bite did n't hurt anymore , and he took a bigger chunk . Until now , he 'd never appreciated how big his arms had grown since he 'd begun working out . The sixth and seventh bites exposed the artery in a frame of ragged red meat , throbbing next to the exposed bone . He thought of the commercial from when he was a kid , where the owl says , " How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie-Roll center of a Tootsie Pop ? " It had taken three minutes to get this far and he still had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artery and gnawed it , sawing with his molars until he was rewarded with three spurts of warmth in his mouth before the artery slowly pulled back into the meat . He stopped for a moment as the guy beside him sighed contentedly in his sleep . If he woke up now , this would all be in vain . Conservatively , he only had twelve minutes before the pain hit him full bore . He was quietly weeping , still bracing himself with his ungnawed arm . He bit down on the bone and his teeth hurt . He felt the bone flex as he brought the entire muscle of his jaw to bear . His face was covered with stickiness that smelled like metal . He was glad he 'd already vomited . He wished he was drunker . He gnawed at the bone with his molars until he felt the bone crunch under his bite and he clenched his jaw harder . The bone snapped in his mouth and a smooth splinter stabbed into his lip , causing his head to jerk back . Tears rolled from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't do it again . After the bone , the rest was easy . He bit through the less sensitive triceps and was free of his arm and his host . He stood up shakily . His legs were trembling and his balance was off . There was a big dark stain where he 'd been bleeding for the last eight minutes . The stub of exposed bone and meat was bleeding , but very little . He pulled on his pants in the light of the clock that now read 6:39 . Trying to zip up his jeans , he caught several hairs in his zipper and let it go at that . He could not fasten them one handed . He picked up his white shirt , wadded it up and pressed it to the stub . Then , with infinite care , he navigated to the bedroom door , quietly exited , and closed it behind him . He passed by the kitchen where he might have eaten a leisurely breakfast , stopped in the bathroom , did not once look at where his arm had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood from his face , and let himself out of the front door . He bolted from the warm house into the morning air . He grinned , despite the chill and the pain that shortly would overtake him . He had done his penance and freed himself . He had made the whole incident not happen . He was normal . His daddy 'd be proud . He looked into the sun , just now coming over the horizon , howled his freedom to the morning , and took off for the hospital in an unbalanced barefoot lope.
