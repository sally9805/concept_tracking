Prologue <p> Schemer <p> The cemetery was just outside the Los Alegres city limits , big , sprawling , divided into older and newer sections built on rolling slopes . Plenty of trees and ground cover throughout . No night caretaker , no regular patrols , only a few night lights widely spaced . Gates locked at night , but the fences around it were six feet high and not topped by anything dangerous . Country road that ran along the front mostly deserted after midnight . No side roads . No houses anywhere in the vicinity . One tree-shadowed turnout toward the west end where you could park without worry of being noticed . <p> He rolled on past the gates , slow . Two-twenty a.m. , nobody on the road , every light stationary . This was the third time he 'd been out here this late . Three other trips during the day to pinpoint the family plot and to memorize the routes through the grounds . Ready as he 'd ever be . To-night was the night . <p> He felt good . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Controlled . Oh , he was ready  --  not just for the cemetery but for the rest of it to follow . <p> Turnout just ahead . Road still deserted . He shut off the headlights , swung in under the trees , silenced the engine . The backpack was on the seat beside him . He pulled it over onto his lap , held it gently when he got out , strapped it gently onto his back . Not much weight . One collapsible camping shovel , a pair of heavy gloves , two glass vials , and a cut length of cardboard did n't weigh much at all . The Kodak digital camera was in his jacket pocket . You could take decent photos with it  --  good resolution , good zoom , high ISO sensitivity . He preferred old-fashioned single-lens reflex cameras , but his old Nikkormat was too bulky to . t into the backpack . <p> Piece of cake , climbing the fence . He stayed in shape by watching what he ate , running five miles most days after work . But he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backpack against the fence piping . The vials were pretty much unbreakable and he 'd packed them in cotton batting , but he still had to be careful . Now , and in everything he did in the future . No mistakes . <p> Big shade tree not too far from the fence . He went over and stood under it , looking around , making sure of his bearings . Things looked different at night , the rows and shapes of grave markers big and small , the narrow gravel roads and footpaths that crisscrossed the cemetery . No moon to night , but the sky was clear and there was enough starlight for him to see by . He 'd always had good night vision . <p> Took him only a few seconds to locate the landmark he 'd picked out : tall marble obelisk jutting up from the lawn in the newer section down here . It was maybe a hundred yards from where he stood . And from there , two hundred yards and ten degrees uphill to the Henderson plot in the older section . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crossing some of the graves , skirting others when there was a path to walk on . Some kind of bird made a noise ; wind rustled tree branches ; his steps set off little crunching sounds . Otherwise , stillness . Down below and behind him , the country road stayed empty . <p> Five or six minutes and he was at the Henderson plot . He recognized it , all right , even in the darkness , but he made sure anyway . Leaned up close to the six-by-four granite monument , shaded the beam of his pencil flash with his hand , and clicked it on just long enough to read the engraving . <p> LLOYD HENDERSON <p> 1933-2004 <p> BELOVED FATHER <p> Beloved . Jesus ! <p> Rage boiled up in him . He had to stop himself from kicking the stone . Control , man , control . Too bad the marker was so goddamn big and heavy , cemented into the ground , otherwise he 'd 've yanked it out or knocked it over . Smashed it to bits with a sledgehammer , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that would make too much noise . <p> He spat on it instead , as he had each time before . <p> Spat on the grave below it . <p> Then he took off the backpack , brought out the pair of heavy gloves and the shovel , and began to dig . <p> Did n't take him long . The earth under a layer of sod grass was loamy , easy to scoop into . Henderson had been cremated , the urn with his ashes planted here , and gravediggers did n't go down very deep when they were burying an urn . The shovel blade clanked on it and he dug it out , picked it up . Spat on it and laid it down next to the hole . Opened the backpack again and took out the two vials and unscrewed the cap on the smaller one . Slow and careful , slow and careful . <p> He bent forward , legs spread and feet planted , and extended the vial over the urn , just about an inch above it . Then he let the acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a snake , as it ate into the bronze . Vapor came up , stinking . He stepped back . Kind of a wild laugh in his throat , but he did n't let it come out . Calm . Do n't ever let yourself lose your cool . <p> But he said out loud what he was thinking . Had to say it , had to let that much come out . <p> " You son of a bitch , " he said , " now you 're burning for sure ! " <p> To the backpack again for the second , larger vial . Opened that one , stepped cautiously around the smoking , burning remains of Lloyd fucking Henderson , leaned toward the monument in the same stance as before , and hurled the acid at the smooth granite face . <p> More hissing , more stinking vapors . <p> The name , the dates , the words " Beloved Father " began to disappear . <p> Now for the pix . One of the smoldering urn and ashes , one of the burning headstone . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned up to shoot . Did n't have enough time to make each one perfect , not that he could have done that anyway with the digital camera , but it had a fairly sophisticated light meter built in , and you could count on the electronic . ash to work every time . <p> Almost done . One more thing , the final touch  --  the sign that would let the rest of them know what they were in for . Do it quick , he 'd been here long enough . But his hands inside the gloves felt itchy , dirty . There was a water tap on the lane nearby that he 'd spotted the first time he came here ; he went to it , washed his hands as best he could without soap . Should 've thought to bring a bar along with him . Well , it would n't be long until he was back at the motel . Do a proper job then . <p> He flap-dried his hands , eased them back into the gloves . Then he took the piece of cardboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low cement border at the front of the plot . He 'd thought about adding one of his initials at the bottom , but there was no need for that . It would n't mean anything to them . The five words he 'd painted in big bloodred letters were enough . <p> Damn straight , he thought . <p> He caught up the backpack , spat once more on what was left of the gravesite , and made his way , slow and careful , back to the van . <p> Excerpted from SCHEMERS by Bill Pronzini <br> Copyright 2009 by Pronzini-Muller Family Trust <br> Published in April 2009 by Tom Doherty Associates
