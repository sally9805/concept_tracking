<p> After years of setbacks to nonproliferation efforts involving North Korea and Iran , the news appears to be good : a reactor shuttered , inspectors readmitted , the brakes applied to uranium enrichment . <p> Or , as some critics of the diplomatic efforts contend , are the two nuclear scofflaws hoodwinking the international community with clever diversions while they pursue a goal of developing nuclear weapons ? <p> North Korea last weekend shut down a nuclear power plant that provided fuel for its nuclear weapons program , while Iran has slowed its uranium enrichment program . Both countries have agreed to readmit international inspectors : North Korea to verify and monitor the disabling of its Yongbyon nuclear reactor , and Iran to monitor a heavy-water reactor that experts say could be used to develop weapons-grade plutonium . <p> Iran has also agreed , for example , to a set of new inspection safeguards for its nuclear fuel-enrichment plant in Natanz . <p> And six-party talks on North Korea 's nuclear operations are set to resume Wednesday in Beijing . <p> But not everyone thinks that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like promising compliance by North Korea and Iran could simply be a facade behind which the two countries advance toward entry into the club of nuclear countries . <p> The North Korea deal , which rewards Pyongyang with food and oil , marks the end of the Bush administration 's tough , desist-or-else approach to what it considered rogue regimes with nuclear ambitions , says John Bolton , the administration 's former United Nations ambassador . <p> " This is North Korea succeeding with a tactical maneuver , something they 've perfected over the last 50 years , but I still think they are never going to give up their nuclear capability because it is their trump card , " he says.Now an expert in international institutions at the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) in Washington , Mr. Bolton expects both regimes to interpret recent actions by the international community , including the US , as a green light to pursue their nuclear aims . <p> Prospect of denuclearization <p> But supporters of the North Korea deal in particular say it puts the international community back on a path - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's denuclearization . It is not surprising , they add , that the Bush administration 's regime-change advocates would condemn the accord with Pyongyang , since it suggests a return to pragmatic bargaining with adversaries . <p> " All the people who want to bomb Iran and believe we can cause a collapse of the North Korean regime have a vested interest in downplaying the significance of any negotiated solution , " says Joseph Cirincione , a nonproliferation expert at the Center for American Progress in Washington . <p> " First we had Libya , and now North Korea is showing the efficacy of a policy that tries to change a regime 's behavior , rather than trying to change a regime . " <p> After years of diplomatic and economic isolation over his weapons programs and support for extremist organizations , Libyan leader Muammar Qadaffi gave up his programs for developing weapons of mass destruction in 2003 . That decision resulted in full reestablishment of the country 's ties to the international community , including with the United States . " We negotiated away a nuclear threat , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in crates in Oak Ridge , Tenn . " <p> Not so fast , say critics of agreements like the one with North Korea . They say Libya saw the writing on the wall with US action against the regime of Saddam Hussein and chose a different course . <p> In the case of North Korea , they add , the Yongbyon reactor was nearing the end of its useful life anyway , so Pyongyang gets fuel oil and food shipments for closing a relic . In that way , they say , the US and its partners in the six-party talks - China , South Korea , Japan , and Russia - are aiding in the longevity of a regime that starves its own people and threatens the North Pacific region with missile tests . <p> The key now , both proponents and opponents of a February deal with Pyongyang agree , will be the willingness of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il to disclose and open to inspection and the dismantling of all his nuclear facilities and materials , including an unverified number of nuclear bombs . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about-faces that have typified the North 's diplomatic approach in the past . <p> Advantage of today <p> But that does not minimize the clear advantage of a closed Yongbyon reactor today , supporters say . Up until last weekend , the nuclear plant was operating while negotiations sputtered along . <p> " The fundamental flaw of the previous situation was that North Korea was operating a reactor that was producing plutonium while the six-party talks fiddled and dawdled , " says Daryl Kimball , executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington . " I 'm not satisfied either , but the fact is that North Korea is no longer producing fissile materials , " he adds . " And it makes a difference if you have material for six to nine weapons , or for 69 . " <p> As for Iran , Mr. Kimball says it is clear the Iranian government is trying to take steps that will stall movement toward a third UN Security Council resolution that presumably would entail even tougher international sanctions against Iran . <p> The key issue with Iran remains getting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he advocates what he acknowledges will be difficult negotiations . " Any agreement will have to have some kind of security assurances , something that gives Iran a clear vision of how giving up uranium enrichment can lead to better relations with the West , " he says . <p> That approach has the advantage of tapping into Iranian public opinion . A new poll of Iranians conducted on behalf of Terror Free Tomorrow , a Washington organization favoring public engagement with populations susceptible to extremism , found that while a slight majority of Iranians favor their government developing a nuclear weapon , 4 of 5 Iranians favor opening up their country 's nuclear program to full inspections and to renouncing possession of nuclear weapons if it is accompanied by outside economic assistance and international trade , in particular with the US.That is all well and good , detractors say , but Iran is not really a democracy with a government that responds to public opinion . For critics of the current course , like the AEI 's Bolton , the better option for a safer world would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an end to the Kim Jong Il regime . <p> Bolton says lost time and progress by both regimes in their nuclear programs make that option more difficult . But he says military action to take out Iran 's nuclear sites , as difficult as that would be , still must be considered . " Admittedly , it 's not an attractive option - until you look at the alternative , which is for Iran to possess nuclear weapons . " <p> But Cirincione maintains that , as hard and unpredictable as negotiations with Pyongyang and Tehran may be , the prospects are better than under what he calls the **38;1221;TOOLONG model . " We went to war with Iraq for the purpose of preventing an imminent nuclear threat . The path we 're now on with North Korea wo n't be easy , " he adds , " but it 's a lot easier than Iraq .
