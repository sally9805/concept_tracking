First things first . The time is currently 0230 , and the situation is currently FUBAR . Now , having given you the complete ( yet still Roguishly pithy ) sit-rep , I can proceed with the confessional portion of this affair . Here goes . I have often maintained that Getting There Is Half the Fun . But today , following the presidential example , I can finally admit the truth : I have misled you . It was all mendacity . Lies . Duplicity . Prevarication . After almost a decade of these books , here is the unvarnished , frank , candid , pellucid , and wholly unadulterated acronymic truth : GTINFFAA . Getting There Is No Fucking Fun At All . None . Nada . Bupkis . Zilch . There is precious little merriment involved in jumping out of a perfectly stable fucking aircraft into **29;642;TOOLONG air , seven miles above the ground , so you can surprise some hostage-holding malefactors unaware . It is not blissful to leave a perfectly fucking sound rigid inflatable boat and insert by wallowing snout-first through several hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fending off nasty , often lethal creepie-crawlies , so you can reconnoiter a village of no-goodniks and then withdraw without being seen . There is no ecstasy in humping several score miles across hundred-plus-degree desert carrying everything but the fucking kitchen sink on your back to blow up a motley crew of transnational tangos . Indeed , the sorts of experiences I 'm describing here can be summarized in a single , evocative , one-syllable word . I am talking , friends , about PAIN . Not the cartoon pain of television dramas and Hollywood shoot-'em-ups , either . I mean the real thing . The kind of pain that hurts ; hurts for days . The linger-ing agony of a badly hyperextended joint when you smack the water the wrong way at thirty miles an hour . The month of searing suffering when your chute malfunctions during free fall , a nylon line slaps you across the eyes , ripping your goggles off and tearing your cornea loose . The involuntary tightening of sphincter muscles as a ricochet from your own weapon caroms off a metal wall , bounces off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slices through your side , just below the brisket half an inch below where your bulletproof vest stops . Now , let me say that all of the various varieties of pain encapsulated in the above activities : each and every ding , all the blisters , bruises , contusions , and concussions , the gashes , lacerations , and plain , no-frills smacks upside the head , all of them pale when compared with my current situation . And what , precisely , was my current situation ? All you Enquiring minds want to know , huh ? Let 's put it this way : my current situation comes straight out of the BOHICA handbook . I mean , I 've been cracked , smacked , whacked , and hacked ; I 've been thumped , dumped , bumped , and whumped ; I 've been ground , crowned , browned , and drowned . But until tonight , I 've never experienced it while greased . Yeah , greased . Like a cheap French fry . I mean as thickly coated with petroleum jelly as the Herndon Monument the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as the last act of their first year . I mean schmeared . Like a bagel . I mean daubed , as with lard . Like Gertrude Ederle on her first attempt to swim the English fucking Channel . So okay , maybe if you 're a Channel swimmer , and you 're wearing a 1930s one-piece wool bathing suit , maybe it helps if you envelop yourself in pig fat , or Vaseline ( or love-jelly or K-Y , for all I care ) . But me , I had a little more to carry than Gertrude did . I was wearing a wet suit , which was uncomfortably hot in the tepid water in which I was currently attempting to swim . Over the wet suit was a set of basic black BDUs , which as you all probably know after seven of these books , stands for the oxymoronic Battle Dress Uniform . I was also sporting the ever-popular Point Blank Class III-A Tactical bulletproof vest , with its six-pound ceramic chest plate Velcro 'd directly over the ol ' Rogue heart . Atop that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , because with all this extra weight I 'd have sunk faster than what my longtime Kraut komrade in arms , Brigadier General Fred Kohler , would refer to as ein Backstein . Sink like a brick ? Oh , yeah  --  I was carrying almost seventy pounds of equipment tonight . Cinched around my waist was a tactical pistol belt . Descending from it , and attached to the Roguish right thigh , was a ballistic nylon holster that held my suppressed Heckler &; Koch USP-9 and five spare fifteen-round magazines . To balance things out , my left thigh supported six thirty-round submachine gun magazines loaded with 115-grain Winchester Silvertips . Strapped to my back was a scabbard holding HK 's ubiquitous M submachine gun in 9-mm , with a Knight wet-technology suppressor screwed onto the barrel , and a seventh full mag of Silvertips within easy reach . I had six DefTec No. 25 flashbangs in modular pouches Velcro 'd to my CQC vest , along with a secure radio , lip mike , and earpiece , twenty feet of shaped linear ribbon charge on a wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pair of eighteen-inch bolt cutters , an electrician 's screwdriver , lineman 's pliers , a short steel pry bar , and a first-aid kit . Since I am from the **28;673;TOOLONG school of SEALdom , I carried a pair of two-liter bladders of drinking water . My fanny pack contained a handful of nylon restraints , and a small roll of waterproof duct tape . Strapped to my right calf I wore a Mad Dog Taiho combat knife with a nonmagnetic blade . Wound around my waist was twenty feet of caving ladder with modular , titanium rungs and stainless steel cable-rail . With all that dreck attached to my body , swimming the thousand yards from my insertion point to the target would have been , shall we say , difficult , even under the best of conditions . But I had no choice . Besides , we were all similarly loaded down . After all , once we 'd made the swim , there was no place to go for supplies . If there was a possibility we 'd need to use something , either we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do without when the time came . Having just said all that , I must admit that tonight 's conditions were , in the abstract , not intolerable toward me and my men . Many elements actually worked in our favor . The water was warm and calm , with a mere eight-to-ten-inch chop . The current flowed obligingly directly toward my target from our launch point . The cuticle-thin sliver of moon low in the east was intermittently obscured by high wispy clouds , which gave me and the eleven men swimming with me a certain degree of invisibility . Which is why , I guess , Mister Murphy of Murphy 's Law fame , decided that my task was too simple and my goal too easily reached . A twelve-man assault team , swimming roughly one thousand yards , should reach its objective in about forty minutes . We had gone about half that distance in less than twenty minutes  --  and were therefore ahead of schedule . And so , with his usual sense of the ironic , Mister Murphy came up with an additional element of difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unanticipated , and totally unappreciated oil slick coated the water through which I swam tonight . I had n't seen it until I was six feet into it  --  enough time to wave my guys off , but too late for me . We 're not talking about a lot of crude here . The scum was perhaps a thirty-second of an inch at its thickest . But let me tell you something about crude oil : it does n't take a lot to fuck you over , and that thirty-second of an inch of oil fucked me over good . The goddamn stuff stuck to me . It coated all my equipment with sticky , foul-smelling goo . And it weighed me down  --  almost doubling the load I had to swim under . Moreover , oil slicks come under the rubric of what the tree huggers at the Environmental Protection Agency refer to as HAZMATs , which of course stands for HAZardous MATerials . Indeed , according to the EPA 's current Rules of Engagement ( and I 've read ' em ) , one must not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 : a set of EPA-approved HAZMAT coveralls ; 2 : an EPA-approved HAZMAT mask ; 3 : EPA-approved HAZMAT gloves ; 4 : HAZMAT footwear ; and 5 : an EPA-sanctioned hard hat ( in visibility orange , or bright yellow only , please ) . Violators will be severely fined . Their names will be put down in The Book . But since there was n't an EPA tree hugger within six thousand miles , and since I have devoted my life to operating in spite of whatever mischief Mister Murphy or any of his relatives strews in my path , I just kept swimming . Shit , a few years ago , I took a dip in a fucking nuclear wastewater pool . I cured the resulting luminescence ( I 'm probably the only Richard whose dick has glowed in the dark ) with Bombay Sapphire  --  and I have n't noticed any incidences of lighted lizard syndrome since . So , if Bombay can treat the effects of a nuke wastewater pool , I had no reason to think a dollop or two ( or three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the trick , too . Okay , okay , I 'm digressing . You wanted to know about the evening 's festivities . It 's actually quite simple . I was currently attempting to sidestroke through the Caspian Sea toward oil platform 16-Bravo , the main rig of a five-platform operation sitting nine miles from shore , about fifty miles due south of the Azerbaijani capital city of Baku . The rigs were owned by SOCAR , an oil consortium controlled jointly by CenTex ( that 's the Central Texas Oil Corporation ) , and the Azeri government , and manned by a mixed crew of a dozen CenTex and expatriate Brit roustabouts . But that was n't why I was here . I was here because 16-Bravo was currently under the control of a group of eight terrorists . They 'd taken over the rig twenty hours ago , using darkness as cover to slip aboard from a pair of bright yellow Zodiac inflatables that were currently tethered to 16-Bravo 's northeastern hull column and bobbing in the gentle waves . The tangos captured the rig , took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call CenTex 's home office in Houston , Texas . The message , once it had been translated from Azeri into English , was pretty straightforward : we are pro-Iranian Azeris who do not like the fact that you Infidels are exploiting our nation . Get out of Azerbaijan , or suffer the consequences . By chance , two hours after the bad guys ' phone call had been translated , I 'd wheels-downed in Baku with a platoon of SEALs , on a stealth-grade training mission q-u-i-e-t-l-y undertaken at the behest of the secretary of defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . But the well-planned secrecy went out the door the instant Americans were taken hostage . The Azeris knew all about my capabilities in the hostage-rescue arena , skills not possessed by any local military or police unit ( which was one reason for my coming to Baku in the first place ) . So , the government of Azerbaijan wanted me and my guys to do the evening 's dirty work . And to be honest , I was more than happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is by example . And taking down this oil rig would serve as a real-life demonstration of hopping &; popping &; shooting &; looting to our Azeri students . That was the good news . Here 's the bad news : someone had told the press I was coming , and there was a big contingent of cameras and lights at the airport . The American networks wanted pictures of me and my guys , and interviews , too . Probably so Christiane Effing Amanpour could use the footage when she charged me with using unwarranted violence of action , nerve gas , or some other illegal substance on the hostage takers . No effing way , Jos . I solved that problem by asking the Azeris to throw the reporters out , something they probably had a lot of fun doing . But there were two additional impediments to my merry nocturnal marauding . They were , in order of appearance , Her Excellency , the Honorable Mizz Marybeth Madison , Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Republic of Azerbaijan , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security ( Central Asia ) , the CenTex Corp . The Honorable Ms. Madison just plain did n't want me and my dirtbags in her bailiwick . We 'd arrived on a JCET , an acronym that stands for Joint Combined Educational Training mission , sans notice , sans cables , sans anything . And as the ambassador put it so ... diplomatically , yet firmly , to me : " No one , Captain , not even with your manifest testosterone level , cuts me off at the fucking knees like that and gets away with it . " Since I understand that kind of language , I ex-plained to the good ambassador that JCETs did n't come under her jurisdiction . I was n't , I explained , heading a diplomatic mission . I was here to train my SEALs , because in point of fact JCETs are training for us , not the Azeris , even though the Azeris might indeed benefit from watching what we did and learning how we did it . " That , Captain Marcinko , is a double trailer load of horse puckey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador , shaking her perfectly coifed streaked blond do . " I read the damn papers , and the damn cables too . I know what JCET missions are . No matter what you tell me , you 're here to train Azeris , and unless you 're gon na do it in Iran or Russia or the Republic of Georgia , or you 're gon na fly ' em back to the good ol ' Yew Ess of A , you 're gon na be infringin ' on my turf . " She was correct , of course . But that 's never stopped me before . And it did n't stop me now . Indeed , after one phone call from me to the secretary of defense back in DC , and another from the Azeri foreign minister to the principal deputy assistant secretary of state for former Soviet something-or-others ( who they finally contacted via cellular during a boondoggle somewhere way out in one of the Stans ) , Ambassador Madison 's fashionable scrawny-assed , Chanel-clad , Vuitton-clutching , perfectly manicured claws were removed from my back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agent in Charge ( read desk jockey ) from Dallas , probably had his last meaningful relationship with law enforcement when Ronald Reagan was in his first term , Ambassador Madison was in grade school , and Tony Lama boots cost a mere two hundred bucks a pair . He was more difficult to deal with than the ambassador . She , at least , finally realized , after some , ah , interface with Washington , that it was the Azeris ' country , they 'd asked me to help , and I had the backing of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the secretary of defense . While she did n't like my presence here , the other political factors were nonetheless overwhelming . And so , being a realist , she bowed to ' em and stepped aside . Roscoe was n't hampered by such political or diplomatic niceties . This was his company 's damn awl rig , and he was going to handle things his way . And what was his way , you want to know . Well , it was Roscoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization slip the tangos a hundred thou or so in American greenbacks , they 'd jump back into their Zodiacs and hightail it outta Bah-Koo , toot sweet . You say you do n't believe me ? Hey , let 's go to the videotape . As you can see , Roscoe and I are standing on the tarmac , nose to nose , off behind the greasy ramp of the big , black , unmarked C-130 on which my guys and I had flown in , so the two of us could have some privacy . See how his thumbs are hooked in his belt loops , like some dime-novel cowboy ? Let 's listen in . " Yo , Dick , I 've been dealin ' with all these friggin ' assholes over here for the last two-and-a-half friggin ' years and three friggin ' American ambassadors by goin ' through the friggin ' Sirzhik Foundation . Turkish friggin ' Mafia . Chechen friggin ' Mafia . Georgian friggin ' Mafia . Russian friggin ' Mafia . Armenian friggin ' nationalists . Azeri friggin ' pistoleros . The friggin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friggin ' system , and here 's how it friggin ' works : I slip the Foundation a suitcase of greenbacks  --  it 's a 501-C charitable organization back in the States , so everything 's on the up-and-up and CenTex even gets a tax deduction . Then maybe the Foundation takes a cut , maybe it do n't , I frankly do n't give a shit , y'know ? Then it pays out however much it wants to as a kinda self-help bequest to the parties in question , after which they friggin ' disappear . I 've done this a dozen times in the past six months alone , so I know something you do n't . Even though these particular friggin ' assholes decided to up the friggin ' ante by takin ' hostages , they ai n't friggin ' terrorists , Dick  --  they 're friggin ' bidnessmen . " Yeah , right . So , I friggin ' explain to friggin ' Roscoe in my quaint , Roguish friggin ' way that the friggin ' Naval Special Warfare technical term for friggin ' people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I add ( somewhat unnecessarily , I thought at the time ) that we do n't pay friggin ' bribes to friggin ' terrorists , and we certainly do n't go through some friggin ' bogus foundation . See how Roscoe 's right hand goes up like a traffic cop 's ? " Whoa , Dick  --  I 'm not talkin ' about a friggin ' bribe . That would be friggin ' wrong . In fact , it would be friggin ' illegal . This is what we in the friggin ' awl bidness call expeditin ' , and the friggin ' ambassador over there , who as you probably know , has been in the friggin ' awl bidness for the past twelve years herself , agrees with me . " It struck me as odd that said friggin ' ambassador could have been in any business for the past twelve years . She did n't look more than twenty-five . Of course , according to the file I 'd read on the way over ( I may look the part of the knuckle-dragging Rogue , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock analyst at Merrill Lynch ) , she was thirty-seven , the widow of the twelfth richest man in Texas , and she ran a corporation with more value than the GNP of most of the countries in the Third World . The article about her in Forbes told me that she was tough as nails , just as likely to season her language with F-words as the Parisian-pure French she 'd learned at Madeira and the Sorbonne , or the economics-speak she 'd absorbed at Harvard 's business school . I should also admit that even the flattering photo spreads in Town &; Country and Architectural Digest had n't done credit to her . Marybeth Madison may have been thirty-seven . But she had the muscle tone and firm skin of a woman who worked out regularly with a private trainer , and so she looked ten years younger than she was . But all that bidness experience , all those advanced degrees , all that ability to use the F-word , and all that muscle tone did her absolutely no good when it came to dealing with hostage situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because , for some reason  --  maybe it was the fact that they were fellow Texans ; maybe she was just incapable of making tough choices when it came to dealing with human lives  --  she 'd allied herself with Roscoe Grogan and Roscoe 's friends at the Sirzhik Foundation , whatever the hell that was ( I made a mental note at the time to check it out ) . And Roscoe , as you have seen , was a government-inspected , Grade-A , Ruby Red , size extra-large Asshole of hufuckingmongous proportions . Now , I could give you a blow by blow of my reaction to this RRA 's chop-logic , but that would waste both my time and yours . Suffice it to say that the ambassador and Roscoe went back to her embassy in a huff ( actually they traveled in her armored limo ) , and I went to work . Over the next eight hours , my men and I moved fifty miles south of Baku . With the help of the Azeri Army , I quietly set up a base of operations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniper teams ( and the four Azeri Spec-Ops wannabes I allowed to observe the situation close-up ) began to assess the situation through their night-vision spotting scopes , I got on the secure cellular and jump-started my intel network back in the States . It did n't take long for me to discover that the TIQs ( look it up in the glossary ) were n't Azeri at all , but Iranian no-goodniks . They belonged to an over-the-edge splinter group from the Revolutionary Guards and called themselves the Fist of Allah . According to DIA , they had infiltrated from Iran  --  in point of fact their strike emanated from the old American CIA listening post in the mountains above the Iranian town of Astara , which sits just south of the Azeri border . Who says fundamentalists ai n't got no sense of humor ? I do  --  at least when it comes to murdering West-erners . Because the FAs had , over the past sixteen months , assassinated seven Americans , three Brits , a German , and a Frenchie . They had n't limited themselves to action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit had come in Japan ; two others in Canada . Anyway , shortly after nightfall , we confirmed that there were eight bad guys on 16-Bravo . Not a huge force of hostiles  --  but enough to cause both us and the hostages considerable damage . We also knew from what the Azeris had told us , and what we discovered through our own monitoring of the situation , that these tangos were efficient , professionally trained , and well equipped . And oh , yeah : unlike me , they were n't coated with crude oil . I flicked goo from my face mask ( I was swimming virtually fucking blind ) , released most of the air in my SEAL vest , dropped under the surface like the aforementioned brick , and kicked and twirled , trying to shed as much of the sticky , viscous crude as I could . I do n't think it did me much good at all . In fact , it was kinda disorienting . But it was still better than swimming through the goo . I breaststroked underwater , in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about thirty yards , then rolled and headed toward the surface for air , my fins kicking and my arms sweeping the water to break up the surface slick . That was when Boomerang , who I thought had been swimming ten meters off my port side and six meters astern of my position , kicked me square in the face . My chin got in the way of his heel  --  and he got me good . Smaaack ! Oh , it smarted . Belay that . It fucking hurt . The blow knocked my mask off , and all the air out of my lungs . I breached better than most whales , sucked air  --  and in the process swallowed about a gallon of oil-soaked seawater . I retched the water back up , then dove again , clutching and snatching vainly for the mask  --  and got another extra-large , extra-stiff , extra-hard swim fin blow , this one right across my big Slovak snout . Instinctively , I grabbed the offending appendage and struggled back toward the surface . Immediately , the fin wrenched out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the periphery of my blurred vision , my mask in his gloved right hand . He held me steady as I washed the glass off as best I could , slipped the strap over my head , fixed the mask back in position , vented it , then seated the fucking thing properly on my big , hairy face . His eyes told me he felt my pain . My eyes , which were smarting like hell from the effects of crude oil and polluted Caspian , told him he had ... no idea . I settled into a vertical position , trod water , blew some air into my vest to keep me afloat , and took bearings . We were about three hundred meters from the platform , well outside the ring of ambient light from the amber sodium work lights , catwalk incandescents , twinkly rail safety lights , red and white flashers atop the derrick , and a greenish fluorescent glow emanating from inside the modular living quarters . There were twelve of us making the assault tonight . The four remaining SEALs in Echo Platoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluster of five , protecting our six with suppressed , 50-caliber sniper rifles capable of making a two-thousand-meter shot with their hand-loaded , 750-grain Hornady projectiles . Tonight , they 'd be shooting at roughly half that distance . 0232 . As long as I 'm catching my breath , let me take a minute or two to explain what we 're about to do . There are only three ways to take down an oil rig . You can swim in , climb up the skeletal frame , and swarm the bad guys . You can chopper in at wave-top height , then suddenly flare above the platform , fast-rope down , and swarm the bad guys . Or , you can jump HALO ( high altitude , low opening ) from a plane , fall five miles , pop the chute at four thousand feet above the water , parachute onto the platform , and swarm the bad guys . Frankly , the HALO approach is the most risky , because HALO does n't assure that you 'll put enough shooters onto the rig simultaneously to do the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad guys before they have a chance to waste the hostages . Fast-roping from a chopper is perhaps the most effective . In fact , if you combine a chopper assault with a waterborne ( combat swimmer ) operation , you can put a shitload of shooters on the platform all at once . But tonight , fast-roping was not an option because I 'd been given to understand there was n't a single chopper capable of holding more than four people anywhere in the whole fucking country . And so , we were going to have to do this the old-fashioned way , a technique I call HP/SL . In other words , we 'd Hump our way in , and then Pump our way up , so we could do what SEALs do best : Shoot &; Loot , i.e. , kill our enemies before they could do any damage to the hostages . 0234 . Finally clear of the oil slick , I kicked off and started sidestroking toward the platform . Boomerang kept pace with me , his long , narrow head bobbing in the gentle current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault team . The core of Echo Platoon  --  Boomerang , Duck Foot Dewey , Nod DiCarlo , Half Pint Harris , Piccolo Mead , Gator Shepard , and the SEAL smidge I call Rodent  --  have been with me for years . Terry Devine , who I named Timex , because he can take a licking and still keep on kicking ( butt ) , busted his cherry status with me in Germany last year . The rest of the team is new  --  but they 're capable . Digger O'Toole , of Hollywood Beach , Florida , for example .... Hey , just who the fuck is that out there making all that goddamn noise ? Oh , it 's the fucking editor . And he wants to know why I have a bunch of newbies on this mission . I have two words for you , ed . No , not FUCK YOU  --  although the thought occurred to me . The two words are retention and reenlistment . Both are down in this politically correct , zero defect Navy . And so a lot of my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of WARRIORS left for me to pick from . And these guys were the crme de la brouhaha . Like , as I was saying , Digger O'Toole of Hollywood Beach , Florida . Digger 's the kind of can-do dirtbag you need on ops like this one . There 's nowhere he wo n't go , and nothing he ca n't climb . Rotten Randy Michaels and a wiry little Brit I call Nigel ( his real name is Rupert . But who the hell is gon na call anybody Rupert these days of do n't ask do n't tell ? ) round out the assault group . Rotten Randy is built like a defensive linebacker  --  e.g. , big and burly , and he can move like lightning when he has to . We call him Rotten Randy because he spent ten years as an Army Ranger  --  and if that ai n't a rotten existence , I do n't know what is . Then , he made the right decision : he realized that life should be an adventure , not just a job , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they retooled him to shout HOO-YAH instead of HOO-AH , at the ripe old age of twenty-nine . Currently , he 's an E-9 . That 's a master chief for all you cake-eating civilians out there . I shanghaied him from SEAL Team Eight after I saw him operate . Randy , friends , is the kind of Warrior you want to put your back up against when the merde hits the ventilateur and you 're outnumbered eight to one . It took him about half a second to volunteer for my Roguish band . His only demand was that I also take his E-5 swim buddy , Nigel , who weighs in at a mere 115 pounds . Nigel was born Rupert Collis in East London , down the Old Kent Road  --  and you can tell it from the way he talks . He is living proof that the only thing that separates us from the English is our common language . Anyway , Nigel came here at the age of eleven ; became a citizen at eighteen , and the first thing he did was join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half hours . That 's not a lot you say . You 're right . But Nigel can do it in the desert . While carrying an eighty-pound load of combat gear . And after he 's run his thirty miles , he can whip your ass no matter how big and bad you say you are . Back on the platform I was using as a forward base was my four-man sniper/intel unit . Mustang , the lead spotter , is a half-Sioux ( I think the other half is mountain lion ) Warrior who grew up in Montana . He 's built sorta like a mailbox , which leads people to believe that he 's clumsy . Big mistake . Mustang is teamed with Hammer Johnson , who learned his nasty craft in the Marine Corps before he decided to leave Uncle Sam 's Misguided Children and become a SEAL . Hammer once made a twenty-six-hundred-yard head shot with the 50-caliber sniper rifle he helped develop for Desert Storm . The weapon he 's shooting tonight is a fourth-generation rifle that 's twice as accurate as the Mark-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butch Wells , a smart-ass kid from Reading , Massachusetts , with a New England accent as broad as the fucking Haavaad Yhaad , and Goober . Goober ( if he has a last name he 's never told anybody , and if I ever knew what it was I 've forgotten ) is Echo Platoon 's other sniperman . Goober is a boatswain 's mate first class from Georgia , and he can shoot the fucking eye out of a housefly at a thousand meters. 0245 . My dirty dozen secured to a long , tubular member that ran between the thick , vertical hull columns . We were fucking exhausted already  --  and we had n't even begun the night 's work . Timex and I unhitched the pair of two-liter bladders of water . I passed one of my containers to the Pick , and the other to Duck Foot , so they could drink . Timex handed one off to Digger , and drank from the other . I lay on my back in the water , trying hard to breathe . It was n't easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air was perhaps ninety-five , and the heat sapped what little reserves I had in the way of energy . I waited until everyone had taken on water , then took one of the bladders and drained it . I 'd sweat buckets during the swim  --  and as heavy as the water had been , I was glad I 'd insisted that we carry enough to make sure each man got about two-thirds of a liter before we made our assault . Something I 've learned over the years is that a dehydrated Warrior does n't perform as well as a hydrated Warrior . 0249 . The platform towered above us , skeletal , gigantic , and imposing ; a mlange of brightness and shadow , all mechanical angularity . Sixteen-Bravo sat in perhaps 180 feet of water . It was what 's known as a fixed rig , which means it was secured to the Caspian 's bed . If the water had been , say , a hundred fathoms deep here , the platform would have been a semisubmersible , which floats on huge pontoons and is kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed be wondering how we could swim in with such impunity , knowing that the bad guys were on their guard . The answer is simple . First , the platform itself is huge , bigger than a twenty-five-story building . It is also virtually impossible to see directly down into the water unless you 're hanging off one of the catwalks suspended below the main deck . The arc lights play tricks on your eyes . The water 's surface , eighty to ninety feet below that decking , is indistinct . It 's damn hard to pick a swimmer out , even in becalmed conditions like tonight . Second , there 's a lot of ambient noise on an oil rig . The metal creaks and groans ; the platform itself moves in the water . The modular sheds and housing units shift as the currents below change . And then there are all those generators that power the electrics , the derricks , and the drilling units themselves . Even when 90 percent of the fucking rig is shut down  --  like this one was  --  it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an environment that I can and do use to my advantage . 0251 . Time to move . But first , I had to deal with the oil . Since I practice the credo of Roy Henry Boehm , Godfather of all SEALs , I 'd hit the slick first and hence suffered more than the rest of my guys , most of whom saw what happened to me and swam under it . My BDUs were almost entirely covered by crude . So was my SEAL vest . But layered below , my modular body armor was pretty clean . So was the wet suit . I shrugged out of the vest , body armor , and BDUs . Then I pulled the body armor back on over my wet suit , peeled the modular pouches off the CQC vest and rigged them onto the Velcro surface of the body armor , reattached my pistol belt , thigh holster , mag holders , and combat knife . The scabbard that held my sub-gun was totaled . But the viscous goo had n't penetrated to the compartment holding the MP5. 0256 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radios and checked to make sure they were all working . Well , I guess eight out of twelve is n't bad , although I tell you , I 'm gon na have some nasty things to say to the folks at Motorola when I get back to the States about the alleged waterproofness of their products . I raised my snipermen , sitting in the darkness a thousand feet away , and told ' em we were going over the rail . " Aye , aye , Skipper , " Mustang 's voice came back into my ear . " I can see you through the night vision . We 're on the case . The catwalk above is clear . I can see one tango on top of the doghouse . He 's got a weapon with night vision . Goober 's got another target on top of the monkey board  --  he 's got NV too . Looks like he 's holding a detonator . " I flashed on the sketch I 'd committed to memory earlier in the day . Okay : one bad guy had command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the derrick man sits . That put the tango about seventy feet above the deck . From that position , his field of fire could control access to the chopper pad , modular living quarters , and the majority of the platform deck areas . From what Mustang said he also controlled the explosives . A quartet of tsk-tsks in my ear signaled message received . 0303 . We swam under the rig and I silent-signaled for the assault to begin . Digger secured the twenty-meter length of thin , nylon rope he 'd been carrying over his shoulder , hoisted himself onto a thick vertical brace , and began the long climb up . He was followed by Duck Foot Dewey and Rotten Randy Michaels . I watched as they wormed their way up the slippery brace . I do not like taking down oil rigs . I lost a man during an oil rig operation in the Gulf of Mexico a few years ago . But , as the SpecWar Commandment says , we did n't have to like it , we just had to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy they were expending to do their jobs  --  visible heat waves were radiating off their bodies . As Digger , Duck Foot , and Randy climbed , Boomerang , Nod , and Rodent perched , their sub-gun muzzles pointed up toward the catwalk fifty feet above the water , scanning for targets . If one of the tangos decided to take a cigarette break or a piss , it was their job to neutralize the sonofabitch before he could raise any alarm or injure the climbers . We were real vulnerable until the first three shooters reached the catwalk . Then , with Duck Foot and Randy protecting his six , Digger would lower the line , bring the caving ladder sections up , link ' em together , secure the ladder to the rail , and lower it , so the rest of us could make our way onto the catwalk . Caving ladders are no fun . But they 're less painful to climb than the vertical braces my trio of shooters had just scaled . 0311 . Eight minutes is a long fucking time when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to get up the ladder . I went up last . Yes , I always lead from the front . But I 've got a bit more age than my shooters , and they can scamper up a caving ladder , while I have to fight my way rung by rung . I waited until Nigel 's narrow butt was ten feet above the water , then raised myself as high as I could , took hold of one of the narrow titanium rungs , pulled myself upward ounce by ounce , until I could get the toes of my right Rogue foot through the narrow opening . God , that hurt . And , yes , I press 450 pounds , 155 reps , every fucking day , rain , sleet , snow , or shine , on the outdoor weight pile at Rogue Manor . I have superior upper-body strength . In fact , I am one bodaciously strong motherfucker . But all of that does n't mean shit when you have to muscle your way up a twisting , narrow , slippery , wet caving ladder under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thousand miles begins with a single step . And for me , tonight 's journey would only begin when I took that first step up . I fought the fucking ladder as it twisted away from me ; used my shoulders and upper arms to get some leverage on the contorted metal and cable , and  --  finally  --  thrust my fucking foot onto the rung . Have I mentioned , friends , that I 'd been swimming through an oil slick ? You say you remember that fact . Well , good for you  --  because your memory is better than mine . Me ? I 'd forgotten that the bottom of my neoprene bootie was as slick as deer guts . My foot went skidding out from under me , my leg slid through the ladder , my hands lost their grip on the rail , and I dropped about two and a half feet , wedging myself  --  ooooh  --  up to my crotch on the fucking rung . Let me be more explicit . All of my own weight  --  every stone , every kilo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to mention the combined weight of everything I was carrying  --  was now resting squarely on my right nut . The selfsame nut that was being squeezed into peanut butter by the titanium rung . Oh damn oh shit oh doom on Dickie , which as you probably know , means I was being fuckee-fuckeed in Vietnamese . Fuckee-fuckee indeed  --  if I did n't do something soon , I was going to perform the rest of this fekokte mission as a goddamn countertenor . I uncrossed my eyes , gulped air , and struggled to pull one hand over the other until I was able to extract myself and start moving upward once again . Except now , each step of that painful climb was accompanied by the tom-tom throbbing of my right testicle . Oh , let me tell you , by the time I finally pulled myself over the catwalk rail , I hurt in every molecule of my body and from the way my wet suit felt , I 'd probably lost another four or five pounds of water weight . I 'm not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in this series , friends , and it is climbs like this one that make the fact painfully obvious . But as I have said in the past , and will say again , pain exists to ensure that I know I 'm alive . And since I was very much alive , I unsheathed my M , loaded a mag , and dropped the bolt . It was about to be Show Time . Our insertion point was the small catwalk at the flare tip end of an oil/gas separator line . Most platforms have two such flare devices . The catwalks , with one vertical and one horizontal gas nozzle , are affixed to the end of a seventy-foot arm similar to the long jib of a tower crane . In the " at rest " position , the flare catwalks sit about three yards below the lowest part of the platform . That made ' em accessible without exposing our flanks . And because it is possible to shinny along the jib , my shooters could remain invisible to anyone on deck until they reached the shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at this particular platform head-on , which is to say , with the helipad in the " twelve o'clock " position , one oil/gas separator flare cluster was at five-thirty ; the other one was at eleven o'clock . We had swum under the rig and climbed at the little-hand-on-eleven position because it was completely shielded by the huge derrick superstructure and main engine heat-exchangers from the aforementioned tangos who were manning the monkey board and the doghouse roof . Now that we were aboard , all that remained was to stay out of sight until we 'd made it to our assault position , while praying that the rest of the bad guys  --  the ones we had n't seen yet  --  did n't have night-vision equipment , infrared sights on their weapons , or thermal-imaging range finders like their two buddies . The unfortunate and nasty truth , friends , is that these days tangos can obtain just about every techno-goodie that is used by Delta Force , DEV Group , or any other cutting-edge special-operations unit . Maybe not the absolute latest generation , but still better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day-to-day basis . The good news was that given the heat  --  it was still in the high nineties  --  all the metal on the rig was just about as hot as our bodies . And that would help mask us as we moved into position if the bad guys had some techno-backup. 0313 . Time to move out . We were real bunched up on the eight-by-twelve-foot platform , and crowds make me nervous under conditions like this . I rubbed the soles of my booties against the nonskid flooring of the platform until I was satisfied that I 'd removed all the oil residue . Then I silent-signaled to disperse . Boomerang and I , accompanied by Nod and Duck Foot , would balance atop the four-foot rail of the flare platform and pull ourselves up onto the rig 's main deck , sheltered from discovery by a red-and-white-striped crane housing . From there , we 'd scamper across thirty feet of unprotected ground , up a steel ladderway , around a corner , and along a narrow length of decking that led to the back side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the platoon would make its way along the jib . When they reached the end , Timex , Gator , Randy , and Nigel would move to port . They 'd crawl under the oil storage tanks , slip behind the explosives locker , then secure the front end of the modular housing unit and wait for my signal to hit the main force of tangos and free the hostages . As they did that , Half Pint , the Pick , Rodent , and Digger would head to starboard , where they 'd thread the needle between the outermost storage tanks and the modular drilling equipment sheds , then separate into two-man hunter-killer groups to neutralize any tangos in the commo shack and stowage areas . We had eight bad guys to deal with . We had pinpointed two  --  the lookouts . I knew from experience most of the rest would be in close proximity to the hostages . Boomerang scampered around the vertical flare nozzle to the corner of the rail . He looked up at the platform bed , which was about ten feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaulted up onto the rail , and with the athletic balance of a ballet dancer , then jumped vertically , about eighteen inches , straight up . His fingertips caught the steel edge of the deck , and he began to haul himself up , as if he were doing the last pull-up of a very long string . Then his left hand slipped . His gloved fingers lost traction on the platform surface and slipped off . He tried to regain his grip , but it was impossible . And he was wearing too much equipment to pull himself up one-handed . I watched as he dropped back into space and fell . Yes , the vertical distance between the bottom of the deck and the top of the rail was only about eighteen inches . But there were two feet of horizontal space to consider as well . If Boomerang did n't thrust himself backward at the same time he dropped onto the flare platform rail , he was going to fall about eighty feet into the water . And with all the weight he was carrying , falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting fucking concrete from the same height . I watched transfixed . This was one of those moves in which time seemed to stand still . Boomerang was suspended in space . But he did n't descend . Instead , he turned his whole body 180 degrees . Then , like one of those goddamn circus trapeze geniuses , his body , facing the flare platform , kinetically impelled itself forward . Only then did he actually drop . He landed on the balls of his feet , right atop the two-inch rail . The only sign of exertion I could see was the tension on his face . His lips moved . No sound came out , but I could read his lips as he mouthed , " Sorry , Boss Dude . " He reversed his position , gauged the distance one more time , removed his Nomex gloves and stowed them in his belt , then leapt . The second jump was a lot higher than the first . Boomerang 's long hands wrapped around the edge of the decking . He drew himself up , up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the deck . Then he swung to his right , which allowed his knee to catch the edge . He pulled himself up and over the rail , dropped to his knees , crawled under the bottom rung of the railing , and held his arms out wide . His expression said , " C'm on , Boss Dude  --  I 'll catch you . " My expression told him , " Yeah  --  right . " When I was but a tadpole , the nastiest feature of the obstacle course at the Little Creek Amphibious Naval Base was a series of telephone pole sections , cut into different heights , and stuck in the sand dunes . We called it The Dirty Name . You had to jump from one pole section to another without falling onto the sand . But that was easier said than done . Because if you could make the vertical jump , the horizontal distance seemed too far to achieve . If you could make the horizontal leap okay , the vertical seemed too high . Now , the grizzled , war-tempered UDT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever made it into training had done their jobs well when they put The Dirty Name together . They designed it , you see , with the high goal of making us stinking trainees realize that nothing is impossible . They wanted to construct the physical embodiment of a philosophical tenet basic to SEALdom . That concept is : if you set your mind on a goal and your spirit is the spirit of a Warrior , the word impossible DOES NOT EXIST . And so , we assaulted The Dirty Name until we overcame it . Conquered it . Vanquished it . And , just as the chiefs wanted , we tadpoles finally came to realize by our victory that when we came up against an obstacle , whether that obstacle was in WAR or in life , we could make ourselves triumph over it by sheer will , pure tenacity , and absolute determination . You do n't have to like it , they told us  --  you just have to do it . So these days , whenever I come up against an impediment , whether it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactical obstacle , I hearken back to The Dirty Name , and I know deep in my Warrior 's bowels that I CAN win the battle , and therefore I WILL NOT FAIL . NOT EVER . And so , although I can honestly say that I do not like balancing on slippery metal railings , I Just Did It . I clambered up , balanced on the balls of my feet as best I could given my throbbing right nut , bent my knees , raised my arms high over my head , and launched myself into the void . My eyes were locked onto Boomerang 's ; my concentration was total . I fucking felt myself approach the deck ; sensed its bulk and physical mass . And then Boomerang 's hands clasped my wrists , like a trapeze catcher traps the flyer , and he swung me , a big Slovak pendulum , upward , toward my right . I used my bulk to help , adding to my speed and angle of trajectory . I should n't have . I should have let Boomerang do what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I could n't leave well enough alone . And so , as I propelled myself up , the point of my right knee  --  the tender ball joint known as the patella  --  caught the metal edge of the steel deck . How hard did I hit my patella ? Hard enough to bring tears to my eyes . Hard enough so that I could n't feel my toes . Hard enough so that I forgot how much my right nut hurt . I started to fall back . I kicked and twisted involuntarily as I did so . Bad move , because Boomerang lost his grip on my left wrist . Oh , fuck , oh , shit , oh , doom on Dickie . He was one-handing me , now . And even that was fucking tenuous . It was a very , very long way down . I did n't want to hit that water . Remember : you drop eighty feet , and hitting water is n't much different from hitting concrete . More serious so far as I was concerned : I really did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I gritted my teeth , swung my left arm up , and grabbed his left wrist  --  which was still clamped viselike onto my right wrist  --  with both hands . " Gotcha , " Boomerang said through clenched teeth . The fingers of his free hand wrapped around my wrists , and , straining , he swung me , the selfsame big Slovak pendulum , up toward the deck once again . This time I let him do the work , and allowed my body to go where he wanted to put it . My knee caught the lip of the deck correctly . I put my weight on the leg , extricated my right hand from Boomerang 's grasp , reached out and up to the support rail , hauled myself up , and pulled myself under the dark tubular metal . I rolled over onto my back unable to breathe , bathed in sweat , my vision clouded by phosphorescent blue and orange spots . Oh , fuck . Not only was I hyperventilating , I was in the goddam HoJo Zone . I fought against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . Slowly , I regained control over my body and my mind . By the time I sat up and began to massage my sore knee , Boomerang , Nod , and Duck Foot were all staring down at me . I gave them the kind of dirty look battle-weary veterans reserve for smart-assed youngsters who 've kicked ass all day , and want to chase pussy all night . I groaned audibly , and grimaced up at them through my pain . Nod pointedly ignored me . " Now that the Skipper 's had his nap , " he stage-whispered to Boomerang and Duck Foot , " maybe he 'll be ready to come out and play . " " Negatory , " Boomerang shook his head . " He probably wants milk and cookies first . " I struggled to my feet feeling each and every year , month , and day of my event-filled life . " Fuck you all very , very much . "
