ContentsInto the Rift Firebird # Baron Roy d'Roye <p> Over the past three years , Rod Garcia has delivered several fantasy stories set in the fictional world of Markovy . This new one follows from " Firebird " ( which appeared in our May 2001 issue ) and picks up the story of Katya and the Bone Witch . But if you missed that earlier tale , you 'll have no trouble getting right into the action with this one . <p> WOODMEN 'S AXES RANG between tall straight pine trunks , sounding sharp and clear in the hot summer noontide . Katya could hear the axes even before she smelled the horse droppings , or tasted woodsmoke in the air . Moving cautiously as civilization neared , she slid from tree to tree , stopping now and again to freeze against a mossy pine trunk , whispering the invisibility spell taught her by the Bone Witch . So long as she did not move nor speak , Katya could not be seen . <p> When visible , Katya was a green-eyed , barefoot witch girl in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wearing a homespun dress with a bright red-orange firebird embroidered on the bodice . Silent as a shadow , she stole softly between the tree trunks , stopping only to disappear . Having lived half her life in the boreal woods , Katya knew every bird cry and animal call , but had only scattered memories of what lay beyond the trees in the land of people  --  bad memories mostly , making her especially wary . She had to cross the settled lands  --  not their whole length which stretched from Far Barbary to Black Cathay  --  just the narrow part lying before her , the valley of the Upper Zog leading into the Rift . And she had to get a mounted knight , three horses , and a national treasure across as well  --  all clearly visible . No easy task , but better than trying to brave the Rift . Axes rang louder as she spotted the first stands of stumps marking a settlement . <p> " Chi-chi-chi-chi . " The red squirrel 's high , staccato warning came from downwind . Turning to look and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bone Witch 's spell . The squirrel 's high-pitched chatter was not the man cry ; instead it said wolf  --  which puzzled Katya . What wolf would be silly enough to come within the sound of axes ? <p> Straining her ears , listening for the soft pad of wolves , she heard berry bushes rattle , followed by a hollow clop-clop , growing louder . Ponies , coming from downwind or she would have smelled them . Whoever rode them was headed for the settled lands , just like her , but Katya did not mean to wait and let them catch up  --  having problems enough already . Turning visible , she slipped off toward the settlement , threading through the stands of stumps , heading for the ring of axes . <p> Trees parted , and she came on a cleared swath dotted with stumps pointed at a broad blue band of sky  --  as if a giant scythe had sliced through the boreal forest , felling trees like ripe wheat . Katya froze and vanished , sharing the forest folks ' fear of open sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as easily as a hawk hitting a mouse . On the far side of the cleared space she saw a tangled abatis of sharpened stumps and cross-felled trees , rearing high over her head ; the settled land 's defense against fire , foes , and plague . <p> " Chi-chi-chi . " The red squirrel 's wolf cry sounded again , even closer , and she took off , hiking up her skirts and dashing into the cleared space , sprinting toward the tall tangle of trunks and stumps . Any roc that got her had to work quick . <p> Crossing the cleared space , she went straight up the pile of trunks , climbing with her skirt rolled around her waist  --  no easy task , since the trunks were tightly interlaced , with their branches trimmed to sharp points . Scrambling up the barricade without so much as tearing her dress , Katya turned at the top , lying down along a log to look back , curious to know who was behind her . She had enemies aplenty , and not just wild rocs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous than a troll-bear . Whispering her spell , she waited , hearing woodsmen 's axes in the distance , and warning cries from the far side of the cleared space . <p> Dire wolves broke cover behind her , big and black with bone-crushing jaws and bright white teeth . She gave thanks to the squirrel for warning her . Coming from downwind , the pack would have been on her before she ever heard them . They shot across the cleared space , straight on her trail , showing they had her scent . <p> Horsemen came next , nomads carrying tufted lances and mounted on tough shaggy ponies , with short powerful recurve bows tucked into red-leather Cathayan saddles . Tartars . Katya had never seen them before , but she recognized them from the Bone Witch 's descriptions . Like Kazaks or Kipchaks they had lacquered armor and terrifying weather-beaten faces  --  but their curiously shaped caps , Cathayan saddles , and sky-blue trousers marked them as Tartars . And they rode piebald Tartar ponies , stocky bigheaded mares with stiff manes , that looked like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sabre-toothed cats . Crossing the clearing , the horsemen reined in when they reached the tree-trunk barricade . <p> Heart hammering , she lay atop the tall abatis , watching to see what they would do . Katya could not imagine why Tartars would be trailing her  --  though that did not make them any less her enemies . Tartars could be merciless foes to anyone unlucky enough to cross their tracks , or they could be scrupulously just , even generous , all depending on their needs . Katya was not about to climb down and test these Tartars ' intentions . She wore a witch 's rune around her neck that protected her from magic , but not from fang and claw , or Tartar arrows . <p> Spreading out , the riders inspected the base of the barricade , probing the sharp tangle with tufted lances . Their trained wolves ran back and forth a bit , casting for her scent , then clumped right below Katya and began howling at her , smelling what they could not see . Katya held her breath , fearing the wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attracted by the commotion , the Tartars trotted over , scanning the top of the abatis and peering between the trunks . Seeing nothing , they talked for a bit in their unintelligible tongue , then turned and followed the line of the barricade northward , calling their wolves to heel . After a moment 's hesitation , the pack took off after them . <p> Breathing out , Katya broke her spell , sliding back along the log , then climbing down the far side of the abatis , happy to have it between her and the Tartars . And their wolves . She had no idea what Tartars were doing on this side of the Iron Wood , but it would not be anything good . Beyond the barricade the pine forest thinned , broken by stump stands and leafy groves of second-growth beeches and poplars . Slipping swiftly away from the abatis , she ran right into the big rough hands of a woodcutter . <p> " Where did you come from ? " the woodsman demanded , looking big as a haystack , with a sooty straw-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roped at the waist . He stank of sweat and onions , and his right ear was missing , cut off for failing to heed his boyar . Felons were taken naked into the woods and nailed by the ear to a tree , then left with a knife to cut themselves free , carrying out the sentence themselves . Had she not been fleeing dire wolves she never would have blundered into something so huge and smelly , and half deaf . He demanded again , " Where are you from ? " <p> " A convent . " Lying instinctively , Katya picked the safest , most irreproachable place imaginable . " The Sisterhood of Perpetual Suffering , by the shores of the White Sea . " <p> " Your head is not shaved . " Rightly suspicious , the woodsman would not let go of her . His free hand held the peasant 's all-purpose axe , able to frame a cottage or carve a spoon  --  the only weapon a serf could own . " Who ever heard of a long-haired nun ? " <p> " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance , " a novice only , on my way to take holy orders . If you will pray let me on my way , the nuns will not like the delay . ... " <p> " But the White Sea lies hundreds of leagues away . " The interfering woodsman did not swallow her tale of a nonexistent nunnery . <p> " That is why I must hurry , " she insisted . How could he stand in the way of her becoming a nun ? What would the Sisters of Suffering say ? <p> Keeping a tight grip on her , he cocked his head to listen . " I heard wolves just now . What are you doing here ? " <p> " Visiting my poor mother . " Katya had no mother , rich or poor , but she would cheerfully invent a whole family to satisfy this big busybody . " I can not become a nun without Mother 's permission . But now that I have it , nothing needs keep me . ... " <p> " Your mother lives in the wild woods ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from beyond the abatis . <p> " Lives in the woods ? " She scoffed at that foolish thought . " Of course not  --  but this is mushroom season . Mother is a humble mushroom picker . I come from a family of pious fungus gatherers . " <p> " Who is her lord ? " the woodsman demanded . " Who is yours ? " <p> " As I said , the Sisters of Perpetual Servility . " <p> " You said suffering before . " He continued to eye her suspiciously . <p> " Same thing . Servility . Suffering . " Any serf should see that  --  but this one snorted , and dragged Katya off toward the sound of the axes . Unable to vanish , she had to stumble along behind the huge woodsman , trying to avoid being clipped by his steel axe . Sooty hands left sweaty black marks on her skin . <p> Ahead of her , two dozen sweating serfs were busy felling a tall stand of pines , sending one of the biggest crashing down as she arrived . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trimming off branches with axes and attacking the fallen trunk with giant two-handed saws . Her captor called to his fellows , " Look what I found in the forest . " Katya had come hoping to look without being seen , and now she was captured by the town crier . <p> " What is it ? " Grimy-faced men called down from atop the log , " A wayward nymph ? A wood sprite ? " <p> " A new young wife ? " one suggested , leaning on his huge saw . <p> " What will your old one say ? " asked an axeman . <p> " Good riddance . " They all laughed good-naturedly , looking her over and smiling , glad to have an excuse to take a break and gawk at a helpless girl . She told her story again , including her imaginary mother and her invented nunnery . None of them were much impressed . " See her green eyes . She 's a witch girl . " <p> " No I am not , " Katya lied . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she almost believed it . <p> " Or a Tartar spy , " someone suggested . " Tartars were seen lurking in the woods . " <p> Her captor glanced back toward the tall trees . " I saw no Tartars , but I heard wolves howl beyond the abatis . " <p> " Maybe she is a werewolf . " No one saw her as a nun . <p> " Whatever she is , the bailiff needs to see her , " Katya 's captor concluded . His fellows agreed , and having decided her fate , went cheerfully back to work . But her captor had found his way out of woodcutting , and dragged her down the footpath toward town , past fat docile animals that would not last a day in the woods , grazing on stubble or pecking at sooty garbage . Like most forest villages , Diymgorat had a single wooden plank street , this one leading from a dock on the Upper Zog to the great intricately carved church that dominated the town 's log huts and lean-tos . Diymgorat meant Smoketown , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning and ironworks upriver . Summer air tasted of soot and iron , and children 's smiles shone against black smudged cheeks . Even the tall wooden church , with its wide gables , carved birds , and troll faces , had a layer of dark ash on its onion dome . <p> Her captor sat her down on a log beside the bailiff 's leather door , telling Katya , " Do not move . " Then he called for the bailiff . When the bailiff came to the door , the woodsman pointed to where she sat and swore . Katya was gone . <p> Sitting still and invisible , staring into the street , she saw civilization go lurching by  --  finding it about as bad as she remembered . Soot-black charcoal burners sloshed through the mud , making for an open vat of beer set up before a lean-to tavern , where iron workers stood drinking with serf women wearing lilac kerchiefs , ruddy-faced from bathing naked in the Zog . Some of the men had pawned coats and trousers for beer ; several were passed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear she had just been right here , telling the bored bailiff all the theories about her , from wood sprite to Tartar spy , making no mention of her brief career as a novice nun . <p> Men at the beer tub toasted the death of the Bone Witch , whom they had held in great fear . Then they drank to " His Highness the brave and lordly Prince Sergey , who killed the gruesome witch in her white bone lair . " <p> Murdered was the word , but Katya did not say it , sitting still and unnoticed , hidden by the Bone Witch 's spell . She had seen the Bone Witch die , and been unimpressed with Prince Sergey 's courage  --  it had taken a half dozen lances of the royal Horse Guards to kill an unarmed old woman . And still the Bone Witch got the better of them . <p> " Hail , brave Prince Sergey , who earned his seat in Heaven . " Serfs heartily toasted that lie , then praised the saints , damned Satan , and swore death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-told lie always satisfied , while the truth just aroused suspicion  --  but she envied the beer swilling , being thirsty and seated in the sun . Crossing the settled lands would be as hard as Katya had imagined . She had barely taken two steps before getting grabbed , dragged into town , and stranded on the doorstep of the local law . She would almost rather be in the Rift . How would she get through the settlements and across the Upper Zog with her noisy knight and horses ? It would be hard enough getting off this bailiff 's doorstep and back to the woods . <p> Bells tolled in the tall wooden church , as the great carved churchyard gates swung wide . Out trotted a column of armored riders in Horse Guards blue-and-white , with black pennants hung on their lances , followed by white-robed priests swinging smoking censers . Behind the chanting priests lurched a gold-draped funeral carriage , with a lord 's charger trailing behind , his silver-studded saddle empty . Riding after the war horse was Prince Sergey 's personal butler holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ikstra . Katya knew that butler , and the butler knew her - yet another reason to stay invisible . Behind the butler came the local boyar , Baron Boris of Zazog , a well-fed warrior aboard a gray charger , wearing blackened armor beneath a green silk surcoat . After the boyar came mounted retainers in Zazog black and green . <p> Serfs fell to their knees around her , abasing themselves before the local boyar and Prince Sergey 's funeral cortege . Sensing the moment for a speech , Baron Boris rode forward to address his awed inferiors kneeling in the mud . Rising in the saddle , he shouted over bent heads , " Be penitent , be humbled , the Prince who defeated the Bone Witch was brought low by a leopard , felled in his hour of triumph . Called to join the Almighty . " This had only a passing relation to the truth , but Katya was not tempted to leap up and correct him . <p> Baron Boris let his lie sink in , then went on in shocked tones , " Alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traitors mean to profit from Markovy 's misfortune . At the very moment that our beloved Prince Sergey was struck down by a leopard , the dastardly Castellan of Byeli Zamak , Sir Roy d'Roye , so-called baron of France , betrayed our trust and stole the sacred Firebird 's Egg  --  rightly belonging to the kings of Markovy . Whosoever sees this foreign devil must report him at once , or share in his evil deed , and burn beside him . " <p> Bad as that sounded , Baron Boris added , " This vile heretic has an accomplice , a godless witch girl with dark hair and green eyes , who escaped with this false knight into the forest . ... " <p> That brought up heads all around her . Diymgorat 's bailiff hastily announced that such a girl was seen that very morning . Her woodcutter captor told how he had hauled her out of the woods and into town . Several drunken serfs spoke up as well , saying they saw the girl the woodcutter dragged in from the forest . <p> Delighted to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to search their log hovels and tiny gardens at once . Serfs rushed to obey their boyar while the object of their search sat and watched . Katya could not believe the commotion around her , and could not guess how she would get out of it . Her throat was parched and she could not sit forever in the heat , watching people down beer and search for her . Trying to take her mind off her thirst , she thought of her knight , hoping he had stayed where she left him . He was indeed a foreigner , and likely to get lost without warning . Several half-starved dogs came up to her , sniffing suspiciously , but that was the closest they came to finding her . <p> Dejected serfs returned to fall facedown in the mud before the boyar 's stirrup , confessing failure . Rising higher in his saddle , their master sternly admonished them , " Wretched worthless oafs , the witch girl was here this morning  --  find her and bring her to me . Until then all hearths are extinguished . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . And find me the Castellan of Byeli Zamak . Witches and heretics must not have the Firebird 's Egg . Burn no fires . Bake no bread . Brew no porridge until you bring them to me . " <p> Here the Prince 's butler spoke up saying he had seen the fabulous Firebird 's Egg , holding it in his hands , " I felt the Firebird Egg 's living warmth . The Egg is no legend , it is the hope of Markovy , and the luck of her kings ; it must not fall into foreign hands . " <p> Groveling in the mud , grateful serfs blessed the baron 's lenience , kissing his boot , swearing on their base souls to do better , vowing not to eat or sleep until they had obeyed their boyar . Baron Boris cheerfully promised real punishments if they failed , then signaled for the funeral cortege to proceed . Horse Guards escorted the gold-draped wagon toward the river dock , where a barge waited to take the body down the Zog to the Dys , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the last of Prince Sergey , Katya did not follow the funeral 's progress , since turning her head would have made her instantly visible . Instead she waited like a bird in hiding , hoping the street would empty out , and she could somehow get away . <p> Bit by bit , the street did empty . Baron Boris 's retainers closed down the log tavern , sending the clientele staggering off . Women came out to bemoan the boyar 's ban on fires , asking how they were supposed to cook and wash , telling their men to scour the woods for her , " or there will be no porridge tonight , and cold beer for breakfast tomorrow . " By and large the men obeyed , trooping off into the woods , leaving only some women behind , industriously using up the last of the hot water to wash themselves , and their clothes , letting their bare bodies dry in the hot summer sun . <p> As people returned to their hovels , a two-wheeled wagon came jolting along , headed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of bread . Seeing no one looking her way , Katya braced herself . When the cart came between her and the women , she jumped up and leaped aboard , dropping down between the beer butt and the wagon 's side . Freezing again , she whispered her spell . Looking straight back over the wagon bed , she saw a big woman in a berry-dyed skirt come running out of the bailiff 's log house , followed by a pair of wide-eyed naked toddlers . Shouting and waving , the woman called after the wagon , but the driver did not even slow . <p> More women joined the chase , some throwing down their washing and picking up their skirts , others dashing naked after the wagon , trailing yapping dogs and grimy children . Quickly catching up with the disinterested driver , they demanded he stop , yelling that , " The bailiff 's wife saw that witch girl leap onto your wagon . " <p> Unable to see the driver 's reaction , Katya stayed stock-still , staring out the back of the wagon at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked worried and tired , some outright fearful , wanting to satisfy their boyar before he devised new torments . Hard to blame them , but she was not about to leap up and turn herself in . She heard the driver 's seat creak as he looked about , then announced blandly , " There is nothing there but bread and beer . Go back to your babies . " <p> " She must have jumped out , " the bailiff 's wife declared . " Did you see which way she went ? " <p> " I saw nothing at all , " the driver insisted , proudly proclaiming his ignorance . " Absolutely nothing . " <p> " Useless fool , " the bailiff 's wife shouted at his back as the wagon ambled away . Katya watched the women disperse , and saw Diymgorat 's single wooden street disappear as greenery closed in . Ahead she again heard the ring of axes . Breaking the spell , she looked to see it was safe , then reached into the bread bag and took two braided loaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a deep drink that went straight to her head , making it swim in the heat . Another drink and her problems did not seem so bad . This cart would take her back into the woods , where she had nothing to fear but wolves and Tartars  --  then she would find her knight and devise some scheme for crossing the settled lands , or so she hoped . <p> Without warning , the wagon jolted to a stop , and Katya just had time to replace the top on the beer , before shrinking back into a corner to disappear . Men jumped aboard the bed of the wagon , big sooty charcoal burners , wearing smudged smocks and blackened leggings . Tossing the bread bag down to the ground , they wrestled the beer out of the wagon , nearly squashing her with the barrel . Then to her horror , they began heaving big balks of wood into the wagon . Here was where she had to get off . <p> Leaping over the wagon rail , Katya nearly landed atop a surprised charcoal burner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber on a black bare toe , producing an astonished oath . Hitting the ground running , she shot off , holding her skirt about her waist , with the bread loaves tucked inside . Shouts rang out behind her , followed by curses and running feet . Dodging between stands of stumps and leafy second-growth trees , she heard heavy footsteps gaining on her . <p> Dropping down behind a stump , she disappeared . Frozen in place , she watched the charcoal burners go charging past , rattling the brush with their bulk . She kept to her crouch , hands pressed to the ground , feeling their huge footsteps fading . But by now Diymgorat had awoken to the uproar with church bells ringing and dogs yapping . Worse yet , the tall log barricade loomed ahead of her . She could never climb the spiked abatis and cross the cleared space beyond without getting caught , not with dogs and woodsmen at her heels . Her only chance was to head upriver toward the Rift , hoping for a break in the barricade . <p> She set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose up ahead of her , forming a sheer amphitheater of steep hills crowned with dark pines . To her right the forest barricade curved to meet the base of the hills , and to her left lay the smoky ironworks lining the Upper Zog . There was a single sharp notch in the hills , where the Zog broke through the frowning heights , cutting a steep-sided cleft leading up to the Rift . Unless she found a gap in the barricade , her only escape would be up that narrow canyon . <p> Hearing dogs getting closer , she redoubled her efforts , knowing her favorite trick of running and vanishing would not work with dogs . Dogs would track her by scent , and be all over her , forcing her to move and be seen . Finding no gap in the barricade , she looked hastily behind her , seeing her pursuers gaining fast . <p> " Katea-katea-katea , " Katya heard the firebird call her name . Looking to her left , she saw the little flame-colored jay flitting between the birches , heading toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Katea-katea .... " <p> She instantly obeyed the bird , breaking left , crashing through the birch thicket , heading for the steep slope at the opening of the canyon . This flame jay was the only bird that called to her by name , and so far he had never betrayed her . Bursting out of the birch thicket , she heard the roar of rapids ahead , where the swift-running Zog tumbled out of the Rift , cutting a cleft in the hills , and powering trip hammers in the iron mills below . She hated to be heading into the Rift , a place she had wanted to avoid completely . Bad as the settled lands might be , she feared the Rift even more . Much more . But now she had no choice . <p> " Katea-katea , " the bird called back to her . Scrambling over rocks and gravel , she scanned the steep ravine ahead . Sheer walls rose up on one side of her , and on the other a vertical cliff dropped straight down to the roaring river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the canyon walls was a narrow trail , no more than a dozen yards across . She started up it , desperate to stay ahead of the men and dogs , even if it meant braving the Rift . <p> She did not get far . Blocking the narrowest part of the trail was a tight knot of thick-armed men in stained leather , blacksmiths from the iron works holding their huge hammers , some wearing slit-eyed welding masks . Her heart sank . Woodsmen , dogs , and charcoal burners were crashing through the birches behind her , and brawny iron workers blocked the way ahead  --  warned by the church bells that something was amiss below . Several of them saw her , shouting and pointing . <p> Moments like this made Katya wish she could really disappear . Sinking to her knees , she wanted to just lie down and cry , unable to believe the firebird had betrayed her ; despite being a notorious trickster , mimic , and nest robber , the flame-colored jay had never played her false before . How utterly unfair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or taking anything . She only wanted to cross the little valley and go on her way . Why would they not leave her alone ? <p> Being down on her knees , she did not see the armored rider until he burst in among the blacksmiths , wearing Horse Guards blue-and-white over steel plate , and whirling a great jagged war hammer , shouting a hearty , " Bonjour ! " <p> Terrified blacksmiths broke and ran , taken from behind by a mounted madman . Big blunt welding hammers were no match for his Lucerne hammer , a four-foot shaft with a steel head that had a hook on one side and three wicked curved blades on the other , made to inflict ghastly jagged wounds . None of the iron workers waited to test it . <p> Leaping up , she threw herself against the canyon wall , clinging to the rock and vanishing . Blacksmiths galloped past , tossing aside their heavy hammers and bellowing in fright ; their serfs ' instinctive fear of trained men-at-arms making them helpless against an armored horseman . Behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoo them along  --  not trying to kill , just encouraging their flight . " Katea-katea . " The firebird flew in triumphant circles , happy with the havoc he helped create . <p> Reining in not far from her , the knight in Horse Guard colors sat easily atop his gray charger , his Lucerne hammer swinging idly at his side . He pushed back the visor on his crested helmet , revealing a handsome clean-shaven face and fashionable bowl-cut bangs . Smiling , he called out , " Mademoiselle , I know you must be here somewhere . " <p> She stepped happily away from the rock wall , glad to see her knight had not stayed on the hilltop where she left him , and had in fact come looking for her . " How did you find me ? " <p> " Mon Dieu , how could I not ? " He extended a steel-clad arm to her . " The whole valley is an uproar , with bells ringing and dogs barking . And birds making a horrible racket  --  including this persistent jay , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the ironsmiths blocking the pass , I decided to ride around and see why . " <p> Seizing his hard mail wrist , she felt his gloved hand close on her bare forearm . Whenever they touched was special , but this time more than ever . After her exhausting chase and helpless terror , his firm gloved fingers felt tremendously reassuring  --  sending shivers all through her , even though it was not flesh-to-flesh . Scrambling up onto his charger 's leather-armored crupper , she looped her arms about his steel waist , hugging his strong body to her , laying her head against his armored back . " Thank you , " she whispered . " Thank you so very much . " <p> " You are most welcome , Mademoiselle . " He could not turn to look at her because of his helmet , but she could hear the smile in his voice . " Pray see if our gentlemen friends are returning . " <p> She laughed and shook her head . " Do not worry . They will not stop running until they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knight 's hard armored sides , Katya rested her head on his steel back , exhausted but happy , feeling the comforting sway of the horse beneath her . Safe again . She had hardly ever felt safe since the day the Bone Witch died ; and when she did , it was almost always with her knight , who was smart , gallant , and a French baron to boot  --  Sir Roy d'Roye , Chevalier de l ' toile , et le Baron d'Roye . He treated her nonchalantly , calling her " Mademoiselle , " but she could tell he loved her , even if he was shy about showing it . <p> " Where are we going ? " she asked , glad to leave that grimy settlement behind , but wary of going deeper into the Rift . <p> " To where I left the horses . " He turned his gray charger up a side canyon carved by a swift streamlet descending the pine hills bordering the Rift . The firebird flew ahead of them , calling raucously , making for the stunted pines above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tethered the flame jay was sitting on the palfrey 's pack saddle preening his red-orange plumage . From the hilltop Katya got a sweeping view of the valley below , flanked on the east by the forest barricade , with the Upper Zog winding through the steep canyon , then flowing past smoking ironworks and the tiny village of Diymgorat , headed for the flatlands and the river Dys . No wonder her knight found her so easily , since the hill looked straight down on the trail where the blacksmiths had stood . Behind her the hills rose even higher , and the canyon widened , merging with the Rift . Somewhere up there was the Iron Wood and beyond that , Burning Mountain , where they needed to go . <p> Dismounting , she helped her knight down , then offered him braided bread , being ravenously hungry herself  --  not having eaten since dawn . She did not like to sneak on a full stomach , which dulled her senses ; but she was done with sneaking through the valley below  --  too many dogs and people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is too difficult , Mademoiselle ? " asked her knight , doffing his helmet and accepting the bread . <p> She sighed and sat down on soft pine needles , taking a bite of bread , savoring the fresh warm taste . " Trying to make it through the settled lands without being seen  --  it is impossible . I thought they would be stupid and unsuspecting , but there is a boyar down there setting the serfs to search for us . As well as what is left of Prince Sergey 's Horse Guards . " <p> " Which boyar ? " Baron d'Roye asked , working his words around a mouthful of bread . <p> She shrugged , the only noble Katya cared about being the one sitting next to her . " A big one in green silk and black armor . " <p> " Baron Boris of Zazog , " d'Roye declared between bites . " He betrayed Byeli Zamak to Prince Sergey . " Before meeting her , Baron d'Roye had been Castellan of Byeli Zamak , the White Castle , holding it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zamak , searching for the Firebird 's Egg . " Baron Boris is arrogant , treacherous , and brutal , his taste in wine is vile , and he never uses a fork except to pick his teeth . " <p> Katya had never even seen a fork , but took her knight at his word . " And Tartars as well . " <p> He looked at her quizzically . " As in steak tartare ? " <p> " Tartars from Black Cathay , with wicked bows and worse-looking wolves . " She shivered at the thought of them . " They nearly got me . " <p> Having taken off his gloves to eat , d'Roye reached over and touched her cheek , sending another sort of shiver through her . " Mademoiselle is scared ? " <p> " Terrified , actually . " Tartars scared her more than all the boyars in Markovy , but that hardly mattered at the moment . Turning her head , she softly kissed his hand . <p> Baron d'Roye grinned . " Mademoiselle is the bravest lady I have ever met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just sitting and sharing braided bread with her knight . Now that they were alone and relatively safe , depraved ideas danced through her head . Everyone knew women were silly sinful creatures , morally void and naturally promiscuous , best kept under lock and key , while being a soulless witch girl made Katya more wanton that most . Boyars kept their wives and daughters in harems and convents , making it more likely to see a unicorn than a noblewoman on the loose . Serfs could not afford such luxuries , and their wives drank and bathed with men , their innate wantonness kept in check by the husband 's whip hand . Markovite marriage custom required the bride to kneel and kiss the groom 's dog whip , begging him to use it on her whenever she strayed  --  one of the reasons why Katya was in no rush to marry . <p> But her knight was a foreigner , full of foolish chivalry and silly delusions of feminine purity . Aside from a few chaste kisses , he treated her like a little sister , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him bathing and shaving , she had thought he was a eunuch . Now she knew he was " protecting " her from his own base male instincts . Charming , though absurd . <p> " We will have to go through the Rift , " she warned him . " Which frightens me a lot . But if we can not get through the settled lands , that is the only way to the Firebird 's Nest . " <p> His hand went from her cheek to her shoulder , then slid down her arm coming to rest on her hip  --  the first time he had ever let himself be familiar . " What is so bad about the Rift ? " <p> " Everything . " She shuddered at the horrors of the Rift , glad to have his firm comforting hand on her hip . " Troll-bear lairs , ghosts , ghouls and lycanthropes , renegades and outlaws . Wild rocs and nine-foot cobras that can spit venom in your eye . And were-leopards ; not the nice ones either . " And the Rift had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover at all . <p> " What about witch girls ? " He was not taking the terrors of the Rift seriously , using his hand to bring them closer . " Would pretty witch girls go into the Rift ? " <p> " Apparently . " She let him pull her nearer , her heart hammering harder than when she lay atop the barricade looking down on Tartars . " Though any witch girl with a whit of sense ought to know better . " <p> " Then I will go as well . " He meant it . She had seen him cheerfully take on two armed men and a werewolf  --  all at the same time , and all for her . " For I would be with you , whatever the danger . " Leaning closer still , he kissed her , letting their lips linger , not at all the way he would kiss a niece , or even a cousin . The hand on her hip squeezed harder , and he whispered , " Let me show you how the French do it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed her again , deeper and more passionately , doing surprising things with his tongue . Unbelievably thrilling , but all they did was kiss , his other hand never left her hip . When he was done , he asked , " Do you like it ? " <p> " Very much . " Katya had seen drunken serfs lying with their mouths together , never suspecting this gross act was the most thrilling thing on Earth . And her heart told her this was just the beginning . Her knight smelled of sweat and leather mixed with the man-smell that all sane forest creatures knew and feared , but she alone found incredibly compelling . Luckily a couple of layers of armor lay between them , otherwise there would have been no stopping her . She asked shyly , " Have you known many women ? " <p> D'Roye looked taken aback . " Some few . I am French , after all . " <p> " Are you married ? " Horrible thought . <p> Somewhat . " That question made him even less comfortable . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that her knight might have a wife  --  or a family . Showing how new she was to this . <p> " My parents betrothed me as a boy , " d'Roye confessed , " to an heiress whose lands adjoined ours . We were married when I turned twenty  --  but that was all long ago and far away . " <p> " Is she dead ? " Katya asked hopefully . <p> " Mon Dieu , no ! " d'Roye hastily crossed himself . " Her name is Marie , and she is quite well , thank heaven . But when I was exiled , she moved back in with her parents . Last I heard she was having the marriage annulled . " <p> " Did you love her ? " This was the question she feared most , but had to ask . <p> " Absolutely not . " He looked aghast at the notion . " She is pious and arrogant as the pox , with a mean pinched face and a fondness for flagellation , keeping a bullwhip in the bedroom for intimate moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boris  --  but we disliked each other even as children . Still our lands matched , and marriage is mainly business ; for love you must look elsewhere . " <p> " Any children ? ' Marriage did not sound much like she imagined . <p> " No , not by me anyway . ' He heaved a rueful sigh . " Marriage killed what little attraction we could muster . ' <p> " Good ! " Katya kissed him happily . " Annulled , or not , the marriage is meaningless . " <p> " How so ? " He sounded intrigued . <p> " All marriages performed by schismatics on foreign heretics are meaningless . " According to Mother Church , everyone outside of Markovy was living in sin , and all their children bastards . <p> D'Roye sounded doubtful . " His holiness Pope Pious might disagree . " <p> " Only because he is a heretic too , " she pointed out . Markovite Patriarchs and Roman Popes had lived under mutual excommunication since the tenth century . " He is the antipope , a lying celibate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would he know about true marriage ? " <p> Baron Roy d'Roye laughed , giving her hip another squeeze . " Fear not , Mademoiselle , however many women I have been with , married , maiden , or crone  --  none were the least like you . You are unique , utterly and completely special . " <p> That sounded much better , as if all the other women merely prepared him for her . " How am I special ? " <p> He looked her over carefully . " You are the first female of any sort that I ever saw disappear  --  unless you count visitations by the Virgin . " <p> She pooh-poohed the miracle of invisibility . " That is nothing , just a spell the Bone Witch taught me when I was ten . " <p> Baron d'Roye smiled at her natural modesty , saying , " You found me wounded and friendless in the woods , with a hefty reward on my head  --  and you have been feeding and caring for me ever since , without a thought for yourself , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . Never have I known anyone so cunning and resourceful , and so artlessly caring . " He kissed her again , deftly guiding her lips to his with one hand , making her feel her youthful awkwardness was incredibly precious , a treasure to be cherished , as magical as the Firebird 's Egg . <p> When she came back to Earth , Katya looked about shyly . No one was coming up the trail , but it was dangerous to tarry too long . She whispered to her knight , " Wonderful as this is , we must be gone . Word of where we are headed will get downriver , and we must go deeper into the Rift to stay ahead of pursuit . " <p> Baron d'Roye acceded to her forest expertise , helping her mount her black mare . Handing her the lead rope for the big bay palfrey that served as a sumpter horse , he added , " And what other wood nymph would criticize the pope on morals and theology ? " <p> Leading his charger to a sandy spot by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-edged saxe knife . Setting aside the knife , he dug the last few inches with his hands , then reached in and withdrew the Firebird 's Egg , wrapped in an embroidered tapestry  --  all that remained of the legendary firebirds , giant flying guardians of Markovy . King Demitri took the Egg from the Nest atop Burning Mountain , making it his talisman , letting him defeat the Poles , Kipchacks , and rebellious boyars , putting an end to the Time of Troubles , and restoring the Mikhailovich dynasty to the throne . For decades the Egg had lain in the vaults of Byeli Zamak , until Baron Boris betrayed the castle to Prince Sergey  --  forcing the castle 's commander to flee into the forest with this prize , where he met Katya . And every day since d'Roye took it from the cold castle vaults , the Egg 's leathery skin had grown warmer and livelier , pulsing like a hard round heart . <p> She led the sumpter horse over , and d'Roye slid the precious Egg into the bay 's packsaddle . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return the Firebird 's Egg to its nest atop Burning Mountain . Baron Boris was only half right , the Egg was the luck of the Markovite kings , but it was their curse as well . As long as King Demitri had the Egg , he had never been defeated in battle  --  but otherwise things had been dismal ; King Demitri lost his wife and all but one of his children before dying and leaving his infant son Ivan ruling over a nation on the brink of civil war . According to the Bone Witch , Markovy 's sole hope was to return the Egg to the Nest . And only that absolute need to get to Burning Mountain could tempt Katya into the Rift  --  one of Earth 's truly terrible places . <p> Descending the steep streambed , they worked their way along the cliff-side trail overlooking the deep canyon of the Upper Zog . Spotting pony droppings , she reined in and dismounted , kneeling over the horse turds , sniffing and poking them , finding them fresh and moist  --  not a good sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her hands , then showed her find to d'Roye . " Horse nomads came through here this morning , maybe the same Tartars I saw by the forest barricade . " <p> " How can you tell ? " asked d'Roye , wrinkling his nose  --  clearly unaccustomed to reading feces . <p> " Here , see these grains among the grass . " She sorted through the broken dropping . " That is millet . Boyar 's horses are fed on barley . And here is a rice grain  --  we do not eat such things . " <p> " Happy to hear it , " her knight declared . " I myself pass up anything found in horse droppings . " <p> " It could be from Kazaks or Kipchaks , " she added hopefully , " but I doubt it . " That stray kernel most likely meant some Tartar had given his favored mare a rice ball reward . She held up the pony turd for her knight 's inspection . " See how it is still warm at the center . " <p> He swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands , she washed them in a little stream tumbling down the rocks toward the Zog ; then they set out again , heading deeper into the Rift , feeling a warm wind spring up out of nowhere , blowing slow but steady at her back . Letting her black mare watch the trail , she kept looking over her shoulder at the sheer cliff face above . Aside from the rushing river far below , everything was silent and still . Too still . Here she did not have the wood 's hundreds of eyes watching over her . Troll-bears you could smell , but were-leopards and lycanthropes could be stalking silently through the rocks above , waiting to catch them unawares . <p> At the head of the canyon , the Rift widened and flattened out , and the Upper Zog sank to a trickle in a big sandy bed dotted with boulders . There they saw the first sign of how terrible a place they were entering . Lying in the middle of the trail was a woman 's head , whose owner had been pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a black bruise under one eye , and the head had been in the sun for some time . Long lines of ants stretched away from the mouth and nostrils . <p> Her knight was aghast and started to get down , but she stopped him . This was just the sort of spot a lycanthrope would pick to await the unwary . He told her , " I was only going to give her a decent burial . She was young and fair , and I can not just leave her head to the ants . " <p> " She is buried , " Katya explained , ignoring the head , looking up at the boulders instead . " There is a body attached to that head . Being buried to the neck and left to die is the penalty for killing your husband . " Yet another reason not to wed . <p> " But we must at least bury her the rest of the way , " he insisted ; so she stood watch while her knight heaped sand onto the head , covering the mound with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grit that gave way to hard flat shale as the Rift widened , its steep walls sinking down to bare white bluffs . After a time , d'Roye asked , " What if a man kills his wife ? " <p> " You mean like if he beats her to death ? " She relaxed , glad to see frowning cliffs replaced by clear open views . Anything could be lurking at the base of the bluffs , but they were safe for the moment . " He gets a new one . " <p> Her knight looked back toward where he had buried the head . " Hardly seems fair . " <p> " But only up to three , " she warned , least he think men could do anything in Markovy . " Mother Church allows a man only three marriages . Any man who whips two wives to death must be careful with his third . " <p> " Or do his own washing . " D'Roye said he could see the wisdom of setting a definite limit . <p> " Do they do things differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead for sign of trouble . <p> " Somewhat , " her knight admitted , still sounding shaken by what he had seen . <p> She was shaken but not surprised . Being unhallowed ground , the Rift was where the law did its worst deeds . " What happens in France if a wife kills her husband ? <p> " We burn her alive . " D'Roye had thought that penalty harsh until he came to Markovy . <p> " How much more civilized , " Katya exclaimed . " We are , alas , a very backward people , only burning witches and Catholics . " <p> " Sensible policy , " d'Roye declared , being a Catholic in love with a witch-girl . <p> " So if we married , you would not beat me ? " Strange customs might prove useful . <p> " I am married to someone else , " he reminded her , " a baroness in France named Marie d'Roye . " <p> " Only according to the pope , " she protested . " And what would he know ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refused to flog my unloving wife for fun ; why should I beat you ? " <p> " How would you ever hope to control me ? " Katya considered herself a handful , being wanton , willful , and raised by a witch . <p> D'Roye laughed , saying , " I would have scant hope of that . Mademoiselle is a wild wood nymph , who will never be tamed . " He looked her over with a grin . " Except , perhaps by love . ' She smiled back at her knight , who risked his life to bury dead strangers , but would not touch a pony turd . <p> A black line appeared on the bluffs ahead , growing thicker and blacker as they proceeded . D'Roye asked , " What is that ? " <p> She wondered at his innocence . Her knight , who knew so much about kissing and killing , was naive about the simplest things . " That is the Iron Wood . " <p> " Truly ? " He rose in his saddle , scanning the bluffs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this distance . " <p> " It is closer than you think . " She pointed out a dark patch growing nearby , slim black saplings topped by curled iron leaves , looking like fireplace pokers stuck in the sand . " The Rift has only a sprinkling of iron trees , and is heavily logged to supply the ironworks on the Zog . See those stalks chiseled off at the base ? " Little black stubs dotted the ground around the stand of saplings . <p> Her knight nodded , staring past the black patch at the huge metal forest covering the bluffs . " Why does the Iron Wood not grow into the Rift ? " <p> She shrugged , " No one knows why it grows at all . " Nothing grew well in the Rift , and the bareness frightened Katya  --  with no berries to pick , nor game to hunt , food would soon be a problem . The Rift felt like a giant funnel flanked on both sides by the Iron Wood , narrowing as they went deeper ; reminding Katya of a carnivorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flies would crawl down the tall funnel-shaped stalk , drawn by the smell of nectar , then fall into the sticky trap below  --  she used to hear them buzzing angrily inside the stalk , until they drowned in nectar and were digested by the plant . <p> " Katea , katea , " the firebird called out a warning , and Katya looked around , seeing nothing . <p> " Look , up there , " her knight pointed a gloved finger at the wide open sky . She looked up , expecting to see a wild roc diving down at her ; instead a dark object drifted overhead , a big black inflated parasail , with a ship-shaped hull hanging beneath it , a Tartar sky-boat . <p> " Something else I have heard of but never seen . " D'Roye sat in the saddle , staring up at the sky-boat , watching it slowly catch up with them . " What propels it ? " <p> " Wind and magic , " she replied , wishing it had been a wild roc . " Light gas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamans are wizards at calling up the right wind . " Which explained the warm gentle breeze blowing at their backs  --  it sent the sky-boat drifting ahead of them , sinking steadily lower throughout the afternoon . Finally the wind died and the sky-boat sank down , disappearing between the iron-bound bluffs ahead . Dismounting , they dined on braided bread , and some pickled meat given to them by the Bone Witch . She told her knight , " I should go on ahead , to see what the Tartars are doing . " <p> " We should both go , " d'Roye suggest ed , loath to see her leave on her own . <p> She shook her head . " They know we are coming , and will be lying in wait . It will be hard enough for me to get close . With you and the horses there will be no chance at all . ' She hated being so blunt , but this was life or death . <p> " Am I so useless ? " asked Baron d'Roye , Chevalier de l ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no , " she assured her injured knight . " This very morning you saved me from dogs , woodsmen , and iron workers . I would not be here but for you . " Katya meant it with all her heart , but right now she needed to see what these Tartars were up to , and hopefully steal some food . She could not cater to knightly honor . " And you must guard the Egg while I am gone . " <p> " Ah , yes , the Egg . The fabulous Firebird 's Egg . " From the way he said it , she could tell Baron d'Roye cared far more for her than for the magical Egg and the future of Markovy . " How could I forget ? " <p> " Please , my love . I will be back as quick as I can . " She had no intention of leaving her knight alone in the Rift  --  not for long anyway . " Just watch over the Egg while I am away . " <p> He looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You really do love me . " <p> " Of course , " she replied , " I never tried to hide it . You were merely slow to notice . " <p> D'Roye shook his head ruefully . " Mademoiselle must be wary , for love is a very dangerous thing . " <p> Again she was Mademoiselle  --  he never called her Katya . " As dangerous as sneaking up on Tartars ? " <p> " Easily , " he laughed . <p> " How so ? " To her , love seemed nothing but good . Her only heartache came from the fear he might not love her . <p> Drawing her closer , he stroked her cheek with his finger . " Because you love with all your heart . " <p> " Is that wrong ? " she asked , kissing his finger . <p> " No , " he told her , " love is never wrong , but it is dangerous . For that is how we are hurt . " He guided her lips to his , and kissed her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When he started to draw back , she would not let him , pulling him back with her hand . " Wait , do not stop . I am not done . " He kissed her harder , more passionately , until Katya thought she would burst with joy . Saying that was enough , she whispered , " Wait here . I will be back as soon as I can  --  maybe with food . " <p> " And wine  --  if Mademoiselle can find it . " <p> She nodded happily , stripping down to her silk shift to move easier , then setting off . Tartars drank fermented mare 's milk  --  but she had not the heart to tell her knight that . Following the Zog upstream over pebbles and bare rock , she walked in the water when she came to dirt or sand , to keep from leaving tracks . Luckily there was no wind now  --  trying to sneak up on dire wolves with a wind at your back was sheer suicide . Flitting ahead of her was the firebird , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patch of big boulders the flame jay left the stream , flying from rock to rock , headed toward the far bluffs . She decided to follow the bird , rather than blunder on alone upstream , where thirsty and hungry things might be waiting . Moving quick as she could over the boulders , she leaped from one to the next , running along their backs . <p> Topping a low ridge , she caught sight of the Tartar parasail and froze , whispering her spell . All she saw was the parasail , and not the sky-boat beneath it , but she knew it marked the Tartar camp . Dropping down behind the nearest rock , she began to work her way forward between the boulders , stopping every so often to vanish and listen . Nothing . Without birds and squirrels the Rift could be deathly still . Then as the rock field thinned , she spotted the Tartar sentry , lying prone atop an outcropping . She would not have seen him at all , but the firebird flew close by him and he looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird Tartar caps with big ear flaps , and he followed the firebird 's flight with his eyes , then turned back to slowly sweeping the area downstream , looking from one line of bluffs to the other , then back again . His gaze passed over her , and as soon as he was looking away , she moved , running lightly forward , then freezing when his head turned back toward her . It was like a game she played as a girl , one of her favorite memories from her childhood in the settled lands . One of the bigger boys would turn his back , and let the little kids try to sneak up on him . Whenever he spun about you had to freeze , or go back to where you started if he caught you moving . She nearly always won , but had never expected to play the game against a sharp-eyed archer who would shoot her if she slipped . <p> Flitting from boulder to boulder , the firebird caught his attention , drawing his gaze away from the deadly game of dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a boulder below and behind him . He must have heard her , because he spun about , looking straight at her . They stared at each other , then he turned and went back to sweeping the lower Rift , ignoring the flame jay 's antics . <p> Safely past the sentry , she slipped through the last of the boulders , coming on a wide clear space with a spring-fed pool at the lower end . Two yurts and the sky-boat sat on a raised bank beyond the pond . She could see straight into their camp , except for a few spots hidden by the last of the rocks . There were no dogs and only the horselines were guarded . There was no guard at all on the sky-boat , which swayed slightly above the ground , held down by silken lines . <p> While she stood watching , two bowmen emerged from one of the yurts , carrying buckets , followed by a woman carrying a cloth bundle . Even from a distance , Katya could tell the woman was no Tartar , since she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tartars being notoriously bowlegged . All three of them walked down to the edge of the pond , where the men deposited their buckets and headed back toward the yurt , leaving the woman to wash and draw water . <p> Katya waited until the men were back in the yurt , and the horse guards were looking the other way . Then she walked calmly down to where the woman knelt by the pond , filling a bucket . Looking up , the woman started , nearly spilling her pail ; looking pretty , but harried , with keen blue eyes and cupid 's bow lips . " What are you doing here ? " <p> Katya nodded toward the Tartar camp , " Spying on them . " <p> " Good luck . " The blonde woman laughed , and went back to filling her bucket . " Where did you come from ? " <p> " Markov , from the royal palace . Prince Ivan himself sent me to see what these Tartars are up to . " Since she had to claim some authority , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Ivan ? " Setting aside her full bucket , the woman sounded skeptical . <p> " That is him . I am his older sister . " She proudly made herself a princess . <p> Scooping up another bucket , the woman began to fill it . " Forgive me , your highness , for not bowing . But as you see , I am already on my knees . " <p> Letting the lese majesty pass , she asked , " Are you Markovite ? " " No , I am a Pole . " Finishing that bucket , the Pole swiftly picked up the next . Even the presence of a princess did not tempt her to slow . <p> " You speak very well for a foreigner . " Her own knight had a dreadful French accent , which Katya found charming . <p> " I have a good ear for languages . " Seizing the final bucket , the blonde woman started to fill it . <p> Katya asked , " What are you called ? " <p> Watching her bucket fill , the Pole shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means Blue-Eyes . " <p> " Charming . " The young Pole did have big round blue eyes , which must have pleased the Tartars . <p> " Actually , Borte means Blue-Eyed Wolf Bitch , " the blonde admitted , " but I usually leave off the bitch part . " <p> " But you must have a birth name . " <p> Blue-Eyes shook her head , " If I hear it said , I may start to cry . Borte must do for now . " <p> Men emerged from the nearby yurt , calling out in Tartar . Horse line guards looked her way , and Katya froze , whispering her spell . Tartars came striding over  --  the same two who led the woman to the pond  --  wearing leather armor and worried looks , glaring about with their bows strung . One said a few curt words to Blue-Eyes who looked about in surprise , then mumbled a reply in Tartar . Slinging their bows , the Tartars picked up the flail buckets and carried them back to the yurt . When they reentered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katya relaxed and reappeared . Looking up from her washing , Blue-Eyes seemed more amused than shocked . " So , you are back . " <p> Nodding toward the nearer yurt , Katya asked , " What did they say ? " <p> " They asked who I was talking to , " replied the Pole , starting to pound her wash . <p> " What did you tell them ? " <p> Chuckling , the blonde beat blue Tartar pants on a rock . " To myself apparently . " <p> " And they believed you ? " Everything she had seen of the Tartars said they were lethally smart . <p> " They think I am a little crazy . " Wringing out the pants , Blue-Eyes stared at her . " You are real , are n't you ? " <p> " Oh , yes . Very real , " Katya assured her . " You may touch me if you like . " <p> Blue-Eyes went back to her washing . " Well , you come and go , claiming to be a princess . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse line guards , Katya asked , " What are the Tartars like ? " <p> Without looking up from her washing , Blue-Eyes considered the question . " They are men , only more so . And smart , devilishly smart , smart enough to get along without women . Their women run the camps and herds at home , so their men can go where they please , taking what they want . If you are what they want , they treat you well  --  but give them the least trouble and they will kill you , figuring there are more where you came from . " <p> Katya shuddered . " That must be horrible . " <p> " Very . " Without looking up , the blonde woman told her , " I was part of a wedding party , bridesmaid for my cousin who was marrying a handsome Markovite landgraf . On the way to the wedding we were ambushed by Tartars . All the men were killed , along with the bride 's mother and grandmother . Then they went through the younger women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared because I am pretty and I speak several languages . You would do well to develop some useful talent , unless you mean to survive on sex alone . " <p> " Besides turning invisible , ? " Katya asked , hoping not to have to please the Tartars at all . <p> " Oh , no . They will love that . " Blue-Eyes looked up to see if she was still there . " They like anything new and useful . And they will see plenty of uses for you . " <p> No doubt . She hoped the Tartars would not see her at all . " How long will they be here ? " <p> " Not long , " Blue-Eyes guessed , spreading out her wash on the rocks . " There is no grass for the ponies . They are only here to meet the sky-boat , which has something important aboard . " <p> " What ? " Katya looked at the sky-boat , tethered to the ground on the far side of the yurts . Up close , she saw the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hauled like a wagon when the parasail was deflated . " What is important enough to bring them to this forsaken place ? " <p> " Something , or someone they took from your people . Tartars are incredibly smart . " Blue-Eyes shook her head , " Way smarter than our men . Before going to war they like to know everything about their enemy  --  all his strengths , all his weaknesses . What he wears , what he eats , what he fights with , how many warriors he has , how many horses . Where they can find water and pasture . Whatever might prove useful . " Katya understood , being here on the sly herself . Most Markovites thought it a mortal sin just to learn a strange tongue , and were far more worried about avoiding foreign heresy than getting to know their neighbors  --  much less their enemies . <p> " And when Tartars come in earnest , they want people with them who know the land or speak the language ; corrupt lordlings , disgruntled exiles , kidnapped peddlers , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the last of her wash , Blue-Eyes bid her good-bye and went back to her yurt , leaving Katya standing by the pond , wondering what to do next . So far she had neither food , nor any notion of what the Tartars were doing here . <p> At least there were no dogs . Setting out toward the sky-boat , she worked her way between the yurts , playing hide and seek with the guards at the horse lines , vanishing when they looked her way . Men were talking in the yurts , and Blue-Eyes sang as she worked . Horses snorted at her , but no men saw her , though a couple looked straight through her , wondering what spooked the horses . One of the Tartar horses was wearing Prince Sergey 's silver-studded saddle , not a good omen , but Katya could not tell exactly what it meant . She finished up standing beneath the sky-boat , listening for signs of life in the wheeled hull swaying overhead . <p> Not a sound . Anyone aboard had to be asleep . Seeing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last man off had left it hanging for when they returned . As soon as the horse guards were not looking , she swarmed up the ladder and slipped over the rail . <p> Freezing as she hit the deck , she saw no one between her and the deckhouse  --  which was good , since deck space was so limited she would have landed in the man 's lap . She surveyed the silk and bamboo deckhouse , seeing no sign it was occupied . No one came out to see who rocked the boat . She put her ear to the paper door . Nothing came from within but the strong smell of incense . Lifting the latch string , she slid back the door , deciding anyone inside had to be asleep . <p> Or dead . Laid out on silk cushions was the corpse of Prince Sergey , looking very good for someone who had been dead almost a week . Dressed in a royal silver and blue robe , Prince Sergey seemed like he was sleeping , except for the puncture wounds on his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone had thoughtfully sewn the wounds closed , making the battered prince more presentable . <p> One look was all she needed . Katya had seen the leopard clamp down on Prince Sergey 's pompous neck , and thought " good riddance "  --  never wanting to see His Highness again , alive or dead . Now here he was again , where he had absolutely no right to be , aboard a Tartar sky-boat deep in the Rift . Not wanting to know what the Tartars meant to do with the prince 's body , she slid the paper door closed , and turned to go . <p> Too late . She felt the boat rock gently beneath her  --  someone was coming aboard . Resisting the impulse to freeze , she realized there was too little room on the tiny deck  --  anyone who boarded would be right on top of her . Corpse or no , she had to hide in the cabin . Sliding back the paper door , she slipped inside , closing it behind her just as a man 's hand topped the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she flattened herself against the silk cabin wall , pulling a couple of big feather cushions on top of her . Hidden from sight and feel , she whispered her spell and waited . <p> First into the cabin was a Tartar shaman , looking like Death done up for a dance , wearing a necklace of monkey skulls , long wild hair , and a white smoke-stained robe  --  white being the color of death in Black Cathay . His face was painted like a woman 's and his cheeks were scarred to keep his beard from growing . Sitting down cross-legged before the corpse , the shaman began a shrill keening chant , so high-pitched that he might really have been a woman . Or a castrated priest . But then what were the facial scars for , if not to curb his beard ? Thankfully , her witch 's rune kept the he-she from sniffing her out . <p> Behind the sexually ambiguous shaman came two hard-eyed Tartar officers wearing steel caps and leather breastplates , who seated themselves at either side of the door  --  the senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a division commander , and the younger one wore the red fox trim of a regimental commander . Last of all came Blue-Eyes who sat beside the shaman at the feet of the corpse , setting out a sheep 's shoulder blade heaped with incense . <p> Heart hammering , but otherwise still , Katya lay watching through a crack between the cushions as the shaman burnt yet more incense , going on with the shrill chant . From time to time he would give falsetto instructions to Blue-Eyes , who rose and anointed Prince Sergey 's eyes , ears , and mouth with a mixture of mare 's milk , Cathayan spices , and fresh sheep 's blood ; coming so close that Katya could smell the heady spices , even through the thick incense . As the keening rose to a crescendo , Katya 's skin crawled . This was necromancy , blackest of the black arts , used to invite in ghosts , ghouls , and night walkers . She had seen the Bone Witch do it , hobnobbing with the dead and near dead on Halloween @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened next made her like it even less . Prince Sergey 's corpse responded to the chant , slowly lifting its head , as if trying to see who was wailing away at his feet . Seeing that badly chewed head rise up next to her nearly shocked Katya out of her spell . It took all her concentration to keep still as the dead Grand Duke bent at the middle and sat bolt upright . With no neck bone to support it , His Highness 's head hung to one side , but that did not stop him from speaking . " What the devil are half-breed barbarians doing in my bedroom ? <p> Bowing their heads slightly , both Tartars politely introduced themselves , and Blue-Eyes translated , " This is Kaidu , noyan of the Forest Tumen , and Mangku his van minghan commander . I am called Borte . " <p> Unable to do more than blink and breathe , Katya lay listening to the dead prince 's reply . " Tell these unbaptized apes they are squatting before Prince Sergey Mikhailovich , Grand Duke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivan . " <p> Blue-Eyes said a few words to the noyan in Tartar , then turned back to the pompous corpse . " Kaidu wishes to know what could bring your august personage to this poor humble woodland . " <p> " Does he ? " asked Prince Sergey . " Well , it is hardly his concern , is it ? Damned impudent , even for some squint-eyed chimp in armor . " <p> " Nonetheless , he wants to know . You are dead , " Blue-Eyes reminded the prickly deceased . " And the dead speak only the truth . " <p> " Every idiot knows I came here to secure the Firebird 's Egg . " <p> After a few curt words in Tartar , Blue-Eyes asked , " Why is the Firebird 's Egg so important ? <p> His Highness scoffed at their ignorance , " The Firebird 's Egg is the luck of the Mikhailovich Kings , Markovy 's greatest treasure . It is what makes us invincible , able to pummel brainless barbarians like these . " <p> Blue-Eyes conferred with the Tartars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Egg you believe you can not be beaten ? <p> " Whoever holds the Egg is invincible , " declared the corpse . " Dare come against us , and dogs will defecate on your graves . " <p> Kaidu smiled and nodded , thanking Sergey for the warning then he had Blue-Eyes ask , " Where is the Firebird 's Egg now ? " <p> " Stolen , " Prince Sergey hissed , " taken by a traitorous heretic and a treacherous witch girl . " <p> Blue-Eyes asked , " which traitorous heretic ? " <p> " Sir Roy d'Roye , Chevalier de l ' toile and baron of France , the former Castellan of Byeli Zamak . " <p> " And what treacherous witch girl ? " <p> " How would I know her name ? " Sergey snorted . " The one that goes invisible . " <p> Katya saw the Pole 's blue eyes go wide , but her voice did not falter . Hearing her translation , the Tartars leaned closer , asking soft questions . Blue-Eyes pretended ignorance , " what do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gone as glass . I did not believe it myself until I saw her disappear . " <p> Blue-Eyes dutifully translated , and the question came back , " Where are they now ? The knight , the Egg , and the invisible witch girl ? " <p> " How should I know ? " asked the indignant corpse . " These questions are tedious . Having monkeys for mothers does not make you amusing . " <p> " You are dead , and need not be amused , " Blue-Eyes replied , " you must merely answer truthfully . " Despite his bluster , the princely corpse was clearly the shaman 's puppet , called back to answer questions with no will of his own . And the questions kept coming . Having failed to find the Firebird 's Egg did not mean the Tartars were finished . They wanted to know all about young Prince Ivan . Was he well ? Did the boy show promise ? Which boyars were most likely to betray him ? What was the strength of the royal Horse Guards ? How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bribes ? Did any have weaknesses for drink or women ? Or pretty young eunuchs ? Endless questions and heavy incense eventually put Katya to sleep . <p> She awoke with a start , instantly visible . Luckily she was alone , unless you counted the corpse . Prince Sergey 's Tartar interrogators had left , taking Blue-Eyes with them . Dawn light showed through the silk walls , and Katya guessed she had slept through most of the short summer night . Prince Sergey looked none the worse for his interview  --  in fact the act of sitting up and answering questions had infused him with a weird lifelike glow , putting a flush in his cheeks , though it had done nothing for his glazed eyes and severed spine . Easing past the prince , she opened the paper door a crack . <p> First light filtered into the cabin . Looking out , she found no one aboard , and the camp beyond asleep , aside from a pair of nodding guards on the horse lines . She slid down a silk line to the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As quickly as stealth allowed , she crossed the camp and skirted the pond . Blue-Eyes had taken in her laundry , but lying by the pond was a bundle containing cooked millet , dried fish , and a jar of kumiz , fermented mare 's milk , all left for her - probably at dusk , because during the night a female leopard had come down to drink , and wet pug marks showed she sniffed the bundle before heading deeper into the Rift . Make that a were-leopard . <p> Clutching the gift from Blue-Eyes , she set out running , straight back the way she came , only slowing to slip past the Tartar sentry . Running atop the boulders , she headed downstream toward where she had left her knight , hoping he had waited for her . Gone far longer than she had intended , she was returning with terrible news . Katya did not have to be a seeress to know these Tartars would soon be looking for them ; Prince Sergey had practically dared the nomads to find the Firebird 's Egg , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , Katya felt she was being watched . Looking over her shoulder , she saw nothing , but that meant little . Hearing the firebird 's warning behind her , she shifted direction , heading straight downwind . When she found the right rock , she froze against it and waited . <p> Within seconds a lycanthrope slipped past her , shaped like a man , but with wolf 's fur covering his body , and a beast 's hairy face and hideous fangs . Unable to see or smell her , he moved off downwind quickly , trying to catch up with his quarry . She let him get ahead of her , then turned downstream again , running as fast as she could . When he realized he had lost her , the lycanthrope would cast about for her scent , and no doubt find it , but by then she hoped to be with her knight . <p> She smelled his campfire first , then the horses . There was something so charming and artless about her knight 's inability to take precautions . Being a French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rift sent his way , and was lounging about the campfire with his armor off and his sword within reach , wearing just his shirt , hose , and quilted arming jacket . Very fetching . Such serene security was just what her jangled nerves needed , and he had barely said a happy , " Bonjour , " before Katya was in his arms , hugging him as hard as she could  --  his welcoming kiss was as wonderful as she remembered . Her knight asked , " What has happened , Mademoiselle ? Have you missed me so much ? " <p> " More , " she told him , " much more . It was horrible . There are two yurts of Tartars looking for us , with a he-she shaman and a talking corpse . And a lycanthrope too , though not with the Tartars . " He just meant to murder and eat her . <p> Her knight sounded confused by the summation . " What talking corpse ? " <p> " You know him , Prince Sergey  --  the one bitten by the leopard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gave me this . " She showed him the bundle Blue-Eyes left her . <p> " Umm , millet . " He looked over her shoulder into the bag . " I am almost hungry enough to eat it . " <p> " There is fish as well , " she told him , burying her head in his chest , feeling on the verge of tears . <p> " And what is in the jar ? " <p> " Wine , " she answered weakly , afraid to tell him kumiz came from a horse . <p> " Wine ? Really ? " He grinned down at her . " Oh , wondrous wood sprite , what would I do without you . " <p> That was what she most wanted to hear , that he needed her , because she so very much needed him . " We are in desperate danger , and must make for the Iron Wood  --  before the Tartars discover we are here . " These Tartars terrified her . Avoiding Baron Boris 's hapless horde of serfs , Horse Guards , washerwomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deadly efficient , flying through the air , keeping keen watch , kidnapping Prince Sergey 's and only because their wolves were away , aside from the Blue-Eyed Bitch . <p> Her knight tried the " wine , " declaring it , " Sweet , but with a bite . Why is it so milky white ? What grape does it come from ? " <p> " You do not want to know . " She pulled him toward the horses , saying , " Come , we must be going . " She had to get them out of the open Rift , into the relative safety of the Iron Wood , where they had only ghouls and werewolves to worry about . Her knight complied , donning his armor and saddling his charger , happy to have the spiked mare 's milk , which made his kisses even more sweet and intoxicating . <p> Heading for the near bluffs , she kept looking back , expecting to see Tartars on their trail . But the bouldered Rift was bare behind her , and she saw nothing overhead but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun  --  to think she used to be afraid of them . Her knight told her , " I too missed you . And feared for you too , when you did not return by nightfall . " <p> She shivered , thinking how she spent the night sleeping next to Prince Sergey . " I was safe enough . Safer than now in fact . " She glanced back over her shoulder , seeing nothing but sand and rock . " They did not know where to look for me . " But soon they would be sweeping the lower Rift looking for her and the Firebird 's Egg . Prince Sergey had come back from the grave to botch things one last time , exposing her secrets , and setting the Tartars on her . <p> " Mademoiselle need fear nothing while I am at her side . " His helmet off , he smiled over at her , looking impossibly brave and handsome . " Baron Roy d'Roye , Chevalier de l ' toile , is your champion . I have sworn to see you safe through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady 's safety . " <p> That was what she feared most , that he would give his life protecting her . She asked shyly , " Am I truly your lady ? " <p> His grin widened . With his helmet off , she could see his fashionable pudding bowl haircut getting long in the back . Life on the run played havoc with your coiffure . " You are my lady , you are my love . How could you ever doubt it ? " <p> " You are married to someone else , " she reminded him , " your wife in France . " <p> He laughed , " Having a wife in France has nothing to do with love . Marie married in order to be Baroness d'Roye , not out of any fondness for me . Why should I love her for that ? I love you for your beauty and your courage , and for your deep and loving heart . I have known no other woman who .... " <p> She never found out what made her so singular . " Katea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back over her shoulder . This time they were there . Dire wolves , an entire pack , coming silently over the rocks behind them . <p> Pointing them out to her knight , she told him , " That means Tartars . We must get up that draw ahead , and into the Iron Wood , before they catch us in the open . " <p> Urging their horses to run , they sped for the notch in the bluffs , a steep bouldered side canyon leading up to the dense line of dark metal trees . Glancing back , she saw the first of the Tartars , a dozen men and more than three score horses , each rider having several remounts , letting them run down any quarry  --  when not at war , Tartars killed fast , fierce animals to stay in practice . Katya and her knight had only their sumpter horse , bearing the precious Egg buried deep in the pack saddle , wrapped in tapestry and a spare coat of mail . At the rate they were gaining , the Tartars would soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knight , saying , " We have to get up that gully and into the Iron Wood . " There the dense metal trees would nullify Tartar arrows and numbers . <p> At the base of the gully , the first arrows arched toward them , falling short , but not by much . As the ground rose up , their horses slowed , while the Tartars raced over the rocky flats , firing as they came . Arrows began to land between them  --  flight arrows , getting lift from their broad heads and long tail feathers . As the gully narrowed , Katya dodged between boulders , leading the sumpter horse , while her knight brought up the rear , his armor being proof against the light flight arrows . <p> Suddenly the line in her hand snapped taut , as the sumpter horse stumbled and went down . Reining in , she looked back and saw the palfrey had been hit in the hind leg . Another arrow hit the fallen horse in the belly . A third shaft struck the pack saddle . And inside that pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back for it . <p> Turning her mare about , she headed back down the gully  --  meeting her knight who was pounding up the draw , headed the other way . As they shot past each other , he twisted in the saddle , calling to her , " Katya , come back ! "  --  the first time he had ever called her by name . <p> With her name ringing in her ears , she reined in beside the downed sumpter horse . Fortunately the horse had not fallen on the side holding the Egg , since she never could have lifted the beast . Tearing at the pack saddle straps , she struggled to untie them and get at the Egg . As she tugged at the straps , an arrow buried itself in the leather saddle inches from her hand , another nicked her shoulder , tearing her shift without drawing blood . <p> Suddenly her black mare gave a horrible shriek . Hit in the neck , the horse collapsed almost on top of her , thrashing and struggling , kicking up dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aiming to snatch up the Egg and disappear . <p> Before she could , a mailed arm came down around her waist , lifting her into the air . Her knight had come back for her , reining in his armored charger next to her fallen mare , then scooping Katya up onto his saddle . " Wait , " she gave a startled shout , " we must get the Egg . " <p> " No time , " her knight told her . Arrows rattled off his armor as he turned again to head back up the gully , aiming for the iron trees at the top . Her knight had abandoned their quest , choosing her over the Firebird 's Egg . <p> Aghast at the loss of the Egg , Katya clung to her knight 's armored body as they pounded up the rocky draw . By now Tartars at the base of the gully were firing heavy armor-piercing arrows , and in seconds the fast-riding horse nomads would come swarming up the ravine after them . An arrow hit the charger 's leather-armored rump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse , and another . Katya could not understand how she had not been hit  --  the Bone Witch had to be watching over her . <p> At the top of the draw the wounded stallion lurched and staggered , eyes aflame and nostrils flaring in agony . Ahead , Katya saw the first of the iron trees , but knew they would never make it . Hit repeatedly , the overloaded horse fell in an armored heap , flinging Katya to the ground . Hard flinty earth slammed into her , scraping her skin and making her head ring . She fetched up against a big boulder , giving her some protection against arrows , or being trampled by overeager pursuers . <p> First on his feet , her knight turned to meet the nomad charge , swinging his hideous Lucerne hammer with both hands . Here at the top of the draw , the gully was so narrow only one rider could come at him at a time  --  nor could the nomads below get a clear shot at him , with their fellows in the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and hand to hand . <p> Which proved impossible . No leather-armored Tartar stood a chance against the Swiss-forged blades of his Lucerne hammer . Curved steel sliced through wicker shields and studded leather like they were parchment and linen , inflicting ghastly wounds and pulling riders from the saddle . Light Tartar lances glanced off his armor , and the nomads never got close enough to use their short deadly scimitars and Khyber knives . Riderless horses bolted past him , or went down beneath the bright sharp hammer , tumbling back into the gully to land in a thrashing pile atop their former masters . More Tartars kept coming , until the top of the defile was jammed with dead and wounded , forcing the men struggling up from behind to dismount , and be hewn down on foot . <p> Katya saw a single arrow arch overhead , whistling as it went . At the top of its arc the whistling arrow exploded in a bright flash , leaving a puff of black smoke hanging in the blue above . As the feathered tail of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tartars came scrambling over the grisly barricade of fresh corpses and dead horses . Eerie silence descended , broken only by high-pitched neighing from a wounded horse . Her knight looked anxiously about , until he saw her flattened against the boulder . Smiling , he signed for her to stay down , starting toward her . <p> Heavy armor-piercing arrows arched over the barricade , falling silently out of the sky like iron hail . Pressed against the boulder , Katya was hard to hit , but her knight was caught in the open . Hit in the shoulder , he staggered and spun about , dropping his war hammer , then losing his balance as another arrow pierced his armored hip . <p> Seeing him fall , Katya dashed to his side , sprinting through the deadly hail . Looping her arm under his good shoulder , she dragged him into the lee of a dead horse . Arrows continued to fall , most hitting the ground behind them , with a couple thudding ominously into the horse they were huddled against . They would not be safe until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the arrow out of his hip . Luckily , armor piercing arrows had sharp hard points that came out as easily as they went in . His hand came up and stopped her , " No , my love , you must go . " <p> She shook her head . " I have to get you to the trees . " Glancing up , she searched for a gap in the falling arrows , trying to gauge the right moment . <p> He pulled her hand to his lips , saying , " I will never make it , but you must live . " Looking down she saw life oozing out of his shoulder , and knew he would not get up . Tears burned her eyes as he kissed her hand , calling her Katya again . " Katya , sweet Katya , I love you so . I only held back from fear of hurting you  --  and now I have . " He kissed her hand again , then let go , pushing her away , " Run , my love , please run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she leaned down and kissed him on the lips , then she turned and ran , dodging through the falling arrows , not wanting to watch her knight die . <p> Firebird SQUIRMING BETWEEN metal trunks , Katya heard arrows rattling the iron branches , but none found their way down to her . Safe for the moment , she hung her head and cried , crawling on hands and knees between the trees . She had lost her love , her sweet , handsome caring knight , as well as the magical Firebird 's Egg that was the hope of Markovy . Both taken by Tartars . She remembered Blue-Eyes 's story of the massacred wedding party ; how the Tartars casually crushed those people 's lives just to get a few useful captives and trivial information . Now the horse nomads had destroyed her life as well , treating settled people the way boyars treated serfs , as mere things to be used or discarded . She ached for her simple life in the woods , where the Bone Witch had protected her  --  but the Bone Witch too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , thinking of all that her knight had done for her . His jokes , his strange tales of the wide world beyond the trees , his gentle touch , and passionate kisses that promised more . Now there was no more . No knight , no Egg , nothing . Her life had become a useless husk , holding only pain and loss . And she could not even just lie down to die ; for if she did the Tartars and their wolves would find her  --  then things would get even worse . Hearing water ahead of her , she crawled toward it , hoping to hide her trail . Most Markovites had a superstitious fear of the Iron Wood , with its witches , ghouls , troll-bears and were-beasts ; but to Katya it was a second home , far less strange than the settled lands . Usually she much preferred the living wood  --  with its food , warmth , and hundreds of friendly eyes  --  though right now the metal wood 's cold , bleak lifelessness matched her misery . <p> She found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and crawled along in it , adding her tears to water that would flow into the Zog . After a couple of hundred paces the wood thinned , and Katya could stagger upright without getting spiked by low branches . She sloshed along searching for a good place to leave the stream . Usually she looked for an overhanging tree , or a grassy bank that would not take prints , but here the branches could not be climbed , and the banks were rock or dirt . Smelling a troll-bear 's lair , she instinctively froze , feeling caught between Tartars trailing her and the troll-bear ahead . <p> Cold water tumbled past Katya 's ankles . Why was she even worried ? The troll-bear would merely kill and eat her . Tartars would do worse , far worse  --  they would make evil use out of her , then kill her . Or worse yet , let her live , seeing all the harm they did with the Firebird 's Egg . Put that way , there was only one choice , and she went straight on past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ox bones scattered about , or the half-eaten leopard carcass hanging from a spiked branch . No dire wolf with half a brain would come within a whiff of this place . <p> And no troll-bear came rushing out to devour her . But as the troll-bear 's stench faded , so did her sense of purpose . Where to now ? She had been running away from the Tartars  --  not toward anything . Katya no longer had her quest to guide her , nor the Bone Witch 's hut to go home to , so where was she headed ? Downstream apparently , because that was the way she was going , following her fallen tears . Iron trees thinned , becoming fewer and shorter , and soon she made out white bluffs between their trunks . Somewhere ahead of her the stream followed a gully or ravine back down into the Rift . Did she want to go there ? She stopped and considered . Was being in the Iron Wood better or worse than the open Rift ? Were lycanthropes and were-leopards worse than Tartars and rocs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ katea .... " The firebird 's warning decided for her , coming from close behind her , a sure sign she was being stalked . Katya headed off at once , splashing downstream and cross-wind , leaving the iron trees , making for the bouldered Rift below . Finding a spot to leave the stream , she headed upwind , running over the rocks to leave as little trail as she could . Coming to a tall boulder , she went up its backside and lay down on top , looking back along her trail . She froze there , whispering her spell . <p> Minutes passed , and she wondered if the firebird was playing with her , trying to cheer her up by frightening her senseless  --  just the sort of trick the flame jay would enjoy . But not this time ; a lycanthrope came loping along , nostrils flaring , sniffing out her trail . She let the wolfman pass , then slid down the front of the rock and backtracked to the stream , putting the lycanthrope upwind of her , with no trail to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , but by then she would be far away . <p> Finding another good spot to leave the stream , she stripped off her silk shift and sat down naked on a boulder , meticulously drying her feet so as to leave no wet prints . Then she dressed and set off swiftly over the rocks , heading downwind , giving the lycanthrope no trail to follow . Katya kept looking over her shoulder , but saw nothing , letting her breathe easier .... <p> ... And ran right into a loop of rope . Dropping silently over her head and shoulders , the lasso snapped tight around her torso . Spinning in surprise , she tried to twist free , but found her arms pinned to her sides . <p> Atop the nearest boulder stood a grinning Tartar , holding the other end of the taut rope . He had been hiding there , waiting for her , and had either seen her descending the draw , or just guessed that she would use the stream to hide her trail , then double back into the Rift . Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it only tightened the lasso . <p> Leaping happily down off the rock , he coiled the rope to keep it tight , talking softly to her in Tartar , acting like he had lassoed a young mare and did not want to spook her . Small chance . She was far beyond being spooked . Too crushed and heartsick to be frightened , Katya thoroughly hated this Tartar , hardly caring what happened to her so long as she saw him dead . Here was one of the men who killed her knight , a hideous nomad who had come from beyond the Iron Wood to murder , rape , or enslave whoever struck his fancy . It would take more than a few kind words in Tartar to quell her anger . But he did not need to know that , so she shyly returned his smile . Nor did he act like a murderer , grinning eagerly , plainly happy to have her , and trying to interest her in talk . He asked her a question in Tartar , and she nodded and smiled wider , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his demise . <p> He led her down the bouldered draw toward the open Rift , heading downwind , while she kept looking back , working the lasso away from her elbows , up toward her shoulders . They recrossed the stream she had waded down , and ahead she saw a bend in the trail , where the path dipped down a bit , then turned sharply to circle three big boulders . With the wind at their backs , their scent was going straight toward the rocks , and the Tartar was making unnecessary amounts of noise , breathing heavily and brushing the bushes with his bowlegged gait . Like most born horsemen , he did not walk well . From above , the firebird sounded a warning . <p> Hanging back as they approached the three rocks , Katya kept the rope taut . When he disappeared around the turn ahead , she ran silently toward him , putting sudden slack in the line . Using that slack to loosen the lasso , she slipped swiftly out of the loop . Letting the line drop , she froze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tartar turned to see what had happened to her , stepped back into sight and stared straight at her , stupidly holding his limp rope . As he stared suspiciously through her , the lycanthrope leaped on him from behind . Leather armor was no match for the lycanthrope 's superhuman strength , and the Tartar never even touched his scimitar . In seconds the wolfman was feeding happily on the horse nomad  --  some parts of Markovy were absolutely unsafe to invade . <p> Blood lust dulled the were-beast 's senses , and the wolfman did not look up as Katya quietly slipped away downwind . What now ? Her knight was dead , so was the Bone Witch , and she owed her freedom to one of her direst enemies . Where should she go , besides away from here ? Downriver to turn herself in to Baron Boris , and be burned for her troubles ? Hardly likely . Home to the woods , where she had lived with the Bone Witch ? Perhaps , but there was little left for her there , since Prince Sergey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew now she needed people . She did not want to be a hermit in the woods , with only birds and squirrels to talk to  --  but which people ? No one had been half so appealing as her lost knight . Moving slowly , senses alert , Katya headed downwind , determined to be safe wherever she was going . At least the forest would feed her . <p> Katya did not see the leopard coming . Despite being extra alert , she did not hear , smell , or sense the were-beast in any way . Nor did the firebird sound an alarm . Without warning the were-leopard sprang from nowhere , landing in front of her , startling her even more than the Tartar noose . Leopards she knew ; they should not take her by surprise . <p> But this leopard changed right before her startled eyes , rising up , becoming upright and losing her spots , turning into a naked old woman , gaunt but strong , with wrinkled features , bone-white skin , and a wild halo of ivory hair  --  the Bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Bone Witch 's arms , and the witch drew Katya to her withered breasts , stroking and comforting her , saying , " Katya , I told you I would come if you needed me . " When Prince Sergey killed her , the Bone Witch came back as a were-leopard to take her revenge , showing how fruitless it can be to fight the undead . <p> " What am I to do ? " Katya begged between sobs , happy to see the Bone Witch , even in this unearthly form . <p> " Have you forgotten the Egg ? " asked the Bone Witch , the same way she used to remind Katya of her chores around the hut . " You must take it to the Nest on Burning Mountain , and when you get there bury it in warm white sand . " <p> " But I do not even know where the Egg is , " Katya protested , wanting solace and affection , not more impossible tasks to perform . " Tartars must have it now . " <p> " Indeed they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil . " The Firebird 's Egg is aboard the Tartar sky-boat . Get it , and I will help you take it to Burning Mountain . " <p> Easy for the Bone Witch to say , being already dead and beyond most normal worries . Katya asked , " How will you help ? " <p> " You will see , " replied the Bone Witch , who had enjoyed being mysterious even before she died . Giving her a withered kiss , the witch wiped her tears away , telling her to be brave . Nodding obediently , Katya watched the Bone Witch sink back down and become a leopard again , then slink silently away . At least it sounded like Katya would get to Burning Mountain , and have a chance to put the Firebird 's Egg in the sand . So what else could she do ? Clearly the Bone Witch had raised her for this , and meant to see it done . <p> With the Bone Witch watching over her , she decided to head straight for the Tartar camp  --  which at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last thing any sane fugitive would do . With the flame jay 's help , she slipped past the sentries . Luckily all the wolves were out looking for her , but Borte , the Blue-Eyed Wolf Bitch , was sitting by her yurt , spinning wool into thread . Busy with her work , Blue-Eyes did not see her until she stepped softly into view . " You ? " Blue-Eyes looked up from her spinning , asking in surprise , " What brings you back ? " <p> Katya nodded at the sky-boat . " The Firebird 's Egg is aboard that flying ship . " <p> " I know , " Blue-Eyes sighed . " They are using it in their magic . " From the way the Pole said it , Katya could tell they were using Blue-Eyes too , and the young woman was tired of talking to the dead . <p> " We must get it from them . " Katya found herself sounding like the Bone Witch , whose eerie , otherworldly confidence was contagious . <p> " Must we ? " Blue-Eyes arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they please ; some of us must live here all the time . " <p> Unfair , but Katya could see she must be a mystery to Blue-Eyes , coming and going without warning , urging her to betray her masters , risking grotesque punishments . And Katya could disappear with the Egg , but her spell would not cover another person  --  leaving Blue-Eyes to make painful explanations . Just talking to malicious spirits was a heinous crime . " Well , I am going to try , " she told the Pole . " Pray for me . " <p> Blue-Eyes gave a noncommittal nod , and Katya set off on her own , sliding past the horse line guards , vanishing when they looked her way . Get in , get the Egg , and get out  --  scary , but not impossible . Finding the ladder down , Katya guessed no one was alive on the sky-boat , and quietly climbed aboard . No one on deck . Sliding back the paper door , she peered into the cabin , seeing through a haze of incense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his place , Baron Roy d'Roye , Chevalier de l ' toile , hands clasped on his sword , his saxe knife still in his belt . He looked so calm , he might have been sleeping , but Katya knew he was dead , lying unnaturally stiff and not breathing . His armor was cut away around his wounds , which were neatly sewn shut , like Prince Sergey 's had been . His head was propped up facing the door , with eyes closed , resting on the Firebird 's Egg . <p> Tears welled up as she shut the door behind her , slipping over to his side . Afraid to touch his dead flesh , she cupped her hand over his lips , feeling for breath . Nothing , but his skin had a natural healthy glow , as if he were resting in the quiet space between breaths . She reached down and grasped the Firebird 's Egg , finding its leathery skin was warmer than ever , and pulsing with life . Saying a prayer for the dead , she started to pry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at the wound on his shoulder , seeing skin had grown back around the stitches . Chills went up her arms and down her back  --  his wound was healing , faster even than a living man 's would . She knew hair and fingernails grew after death , but this could only be caused by the warm , magical Egg pressed against his shoulder . <p> How could she take the Egg away , when it was healing her love , giving him a semblance of life ? By tomorrow he might be warm to the touch , breathing even . She would never know if she took the Egg away . But leaving him and the Egg to the Tartars would not do her knight any good . <p> While she sat frozen by her dilemma , the sky-boat rocked gently beneath her . Someone was coming aboard . Carefully replacing the Egg , she curled up behind her knight and vanished . Presently the paper door opened , and a blonde head poked in , asking , " Are you here ? " Blue-Eyes looked frantically about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was only one escape . Jerking the saxe knife from her knight 's belt , she pushed past the startled Blue-Eyes , going out on deck , where she started slashing at the silk lines tying them to the ground . Blue-Eyes looked aghast , asking , " Are you mad ? Just disappear ! " <p> With no time to explain , Katya kept attacking the lines , saying , " Come with me , please . " <p> " Do I have a choice ? " Blue-Eyes asked , as the sky-boat tilted alarmingly , held down on one side , but not on the other . Shouts in Tartar came from below . Scrambling to the opposite rail , Katya began cutting the lines there . Blue-Eyes walked across the tilted deck and released the stern line , then the ladder , right in the face of a surprised and angry Tartar . <p> Suddenly they were free , lurching off downwind , with Tartar arrows arching after them . Flying free , but not very high nor fast , they drifted low over the Rift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , floating well within arrow range of the mounted Tartars racing after them . She called to Blue-Eyes , " Why are we not flying away ? " <p> " Too heavy , " Blue-Eyes shouted back . The sky-boat had two women , an armored body , and the Firebird 's Egg . " We have to dump the sand bags . " <p> " Sand bags ? " She saw Blue-Eyes upend a bag of sand tied to the rail , spilling it out to lighten ship . An arrow flew between them as Katya leaped to help , grabbing a bag and flipping it over the rail , then cutting it loose , sending the bag with the sand . Anything to get some altitude . <p> And it worked ; with each sand bag emptied or heaved overboard , the sky-boat rose higher , and their pursuers fell farther away to windward . In moments the horse nomads dwindled , reduced to tiny figures riding dwarf ponies . Encouraged , Katya , seized another bag , hauled it over the rail , and cut it free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst through the light wicker bulwark , hitting her hard in the side , startling her like a blow from a stone . <p> Shock washed over her , and she stepped back in surprise , staring at the feathered shaft sprouting from her side , barely a hand 's span from her navel . There was no pain , and little blood , just a red stain on her shift , slowly growing bigger . She remembered her knight lying at the top of the draw , his life oozing away . Now it was her turn . <p> " That should do it , " Blue-Eyes sounded satisfied , emptying one last sand bag , then turning to her , thrilled to have escaped the Tartars . Seeing the arrow , Blue-Eyes was instantly at her side , holding her up , warning , " Do not touch it ! " <p> Not a chance , she had no intention of handling the arrow , which was starting to hurt alarmingly . Katya could see by the shaft that it was not a slim-pointed armor-piercing arrow , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , tearing open your insides . She was good as dead already . Gently Blue-Eyes laid her down on the deck , bending over her and saying , " This is going to hurt horribly . Can you stand it ? " <p> " Do I have a choice ? " she asked weakly , staring up at the huge gas-filled parasail , trying not to look at the arrow . <p> " That 's the spirit . " Blue-Eyes gripped the base of the shaft , and the silk shift next to it . " I learned this from Tartars , who know all about arrow wounds . " Blue-Eyes started to pull on the shirt , easing the silk out of the wound . " When an arrow hits a loose silk shirt , the point carries it into the wound . If you pull out the fabric , it will bring the point with it , retracing the arrow 's path as the silk unwinds , keeping it from doing further damage . " <p> Damage already done to her had Katya on the verge of fainting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hands clutched at the deck , her nails digging into the thin wickerwork as she fought not to move . Closing her eyes , she tilted her head back , breathing in short sharp gasps . Finally she did faint , slipping thankfully into a black void  --  if this was what death was like , then it was not so bad . <p> When she awoke the bloody arrow lay on the deck beside her , and Blue-Eyes was sewing the wound closed . By now the prick of a needle felt like nothing compared to the fire in her side . Her silk shift was a mess , torn and matted with blood , mixed with yellow medicinal powder . She asked , " Will I live ? " <p> " Possibly . " Blue-Eyes would not deign to cheer her up . " At least I certainly hope you do . " <p> So did Katya . Gazing up at the taut black parasail , she asked , " Where are we headed ? " <p> Blue-Eyes shrugged . " Downwind . I assumed you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Burning Mountain , deep within the Iron Wood , but it seemed silly to say that now , flat on her back and bleeding into the wicker deck . She thought of her knight , lying dead in the cabin . " What happened to Prince Sergey ? " <p> " They buried him deep in the Rift , with his eyes , ears , mouth , and anus sewed shut , to keep his spirit from walking . " <p> Katya grimaced , " Sounds ghastly . " <p> " Hideous , I had to do the sewing . " Blue-Eyes wiped off her needle and put it away . " Are you thirsty ? " <p> " Parched . " Katya 's body cried for the fluids that had spilled out the hole in her side . Blue-Eyes propped her up , which hurt terribly , and held a sweet-smelling clay jar to her lips . She sipped and sputtered , expecting water but getting something startlingly tangy . " What is this ? " <p> " Rice wine . " Blue-Eyes encouraged her to drink some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She drank until her head got dizzy and her body felt numb . Then she asked for help staggering into the cabin . Blue-Eyes shrugged , " If you want to lie down by a corpse . " <p> " I do not mind , " Katya whispered , " he is my knight . " Blue-Eyes thought it strange , but all the Pole knew of love was being raped by Tartars . Half-carrying Katya into the incense-filled cabin , Blue-Eyes laid her down beside her knight , covering her with a blanket and a fur-lined Tartar flying jacket , then left , closing the paper door . Laying her head alongside the Firebird 's Egg , Katya passed out again . <p> She did not wake until the morning , when Blue-Eyes brought her wine and millet , saying she had better come on deck . " You must see what is ahead . " <p> Gingerly , Katya tested her side , seeing if she could stand . It hurt , but not enough to keep her off her feet . Lifting her shift , Katya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bleeding had stopped , forming a scab  --  a good sign . Examining her knight 's shoulder , she found his wound totally closed , and used his saxe knife to take out the stitches ; a foolish gesture , but she could not resist . His skin felt warm to her touch , almost alive . An anxious Blue-Eyes helped her pull on the Tartar flying jacket , and stagger out onto the tiny deck , where the Pole had made herself a bed of cushions and blankets . Looming ahead of them downwind was a huge cone-shaped mountain , rising right in the sky-boat 's path . Wisps of white smoke billowed from the flat snow-clad peak , trailing away from them . Katya nodded . " Burning Mountain . It is where we are headed . " <p> " I can see that , " Blue-Eyes protested . " What are we going to do about it ? " <p> " We have to figure a way to land , " Katya told her . " This is where I mean to go . Atop of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I am taking the Egg . " <p> Blue-Eyes looked incredulous , " Why , in God 's name " <p> Why indeed ? Despite the pain in her side , she could stand and talk , even think clearly  --  one night alongside the Firebird 's Egg did that . Given a week she would be fine , and the Egg was healing her knight as well . Who knew  --  it might even bring him back to life ? She was sorely tempted to give it a chance . But that was not what the Bone Witch wanted , not with Burning Mountain drawing steadily closer  --  the witch had promised help getting there , and here it was . Katya desperately wanted to live , and to have her knight back , yet the Egg that was healing him had to return to its Nest . She would not make the mistake King Demitri made , who stole the Egg , thinking he could use the magic for himself and somehow avoid the curse . True , the Egg was healing them , but where had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles , only to die guarding the Egg . And until now she had never been scratched . Katya told the Pole , " This Egg is the luck of the Markovite kings , but there is a horrible curse on the Egg as well  --  we must return it to the Nest it was stolen from . " <p> Barely believing what she was hearing , Blue-Eyes hastily crossed herself , just like Katya 's knight used to do , muttering . " You Markovites are insane . " <p> " Most likely , " Katya agreed , " but do you think you can land me on that mountain ? " <p> Blue-Eyes stared at the fiery mountain drifting toward them on the wind , looking as though she wished she had stayed with the Tartars . " I do not see how we can miss it . " <p> As the mountain bore down on them , they searched for a landing site , selecting a broad tilted snow-field near to the peak , which meant lightening the ship even more . Blue-Eyes began pitching things over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have company coming . " <p> Peering upwind , Katya saw what looked like a flock of rocs with thick black wings , but was actually half a dozen Tartar sky-boats coming up behind them . Tartars knew how to tilt their parasails to accelerate as they climbed , so the nomads were gaining even in a straight chase downwind . Fearing they might catch her before she even got to Burning Mountain , Katya went into the cabin to fetch the Egg . Seeing her knight 's shoulder nearly healed , she kissed the bare warm flesh , then gently drew the Egg out from under his head . " Good-bye , my love , " she whispered , " I hope to be with you in the Land Beyond . " <p> Back on deck , Blue-Eyes helped her into oversized Tartar boots and fur-lined leggings , stuffing cloth in the boots to make them fit . Then they strapped the Egg to her belly , as though it were a baby , crossing a long length of cloth over Katya 's shoulders and around her middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making her feel like an Eskimo . With the Egg pressed against her wound , her pain miraculously vanished , and she might actually make it up the mountain if Tartars did not put more holes in her . Glancing back , she saw the nomad parasails were gaining , and she could make out the boat hulls hanging beneath them , but not the men on board . <p> She looked forward , toward the white-topped peak , finding the ship was level with the snow-field , headed for a bumpy landing . Up close , she saw that the flat peak was a steaming volcanic caldera , ringed with snow and ice , looking like a vast ice-witch 's caldron . Boiling Mountain would have been a better name . Hugging the Egg to her belly , she drew hope and strength from its pulsing warmth  --  until she thought of her knight , who needed that magic as much as she , and started crying again . <p> Stuffing rice balls and jerky into the jacket , Blue-Eyes helped her over the aft rail , holding onto her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue-Eyes saw her tears , and asked , " Do you really want to do this ? " <p> No , not at all . She wanted to be with her knight , nursing him back to life  --  but no one was giving her that choice . Not the Bone Witch . And not the Tartars . " Yes , " she lied , " this is the only way . " <p> Looking down , she saw the first of the snow field drifting beneath her , coming closer as the mountain tilted upward . The dark shadow of their parasail slid silently over the dirty snow . Blue-Eyes leaned forward and kissed her on the lips , saying , " Hannah . My name is Hannah . " <p> " Katya , " she replied with a teary smile . " They call me Katya . " <p> Jolting to a stop , the sky-boat hit bow-first , plowing into the snow . Blue-Eyes let go of her , and Katya pushed off , falling backward to protect the Egg . She hit hard , rolling over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it looked  --  fortunately her big boots and Tartar jacket cushioned her fall . As soon as she let go , the lightened sky-boat lifted off again . <p> When she looked up , the boat was already drifting away over the snow field , with Blue-Eyes at the stem rail , rapidly lightening ship , trying to make it over the mountain 's white shoulder . Lying still in the snow she whispered her spell . On her back , staring straight up , hugging the Egg , she could not see the low flying sky-boat , and could not tell if Blue-Eyes had made it or not . If Hannah had made it . No longer a tool of the Tartars , the Pole had reclaimed her name . <p> Presently the nomad sky-boats appeared , drifting slowly across the sky . She counted five sails , passing almost straight overhead . Where was the sixth ? It was too much to hope that it had hit the mountain . Suddenly the sixth one appeared right on top of her , coming in low to search the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . She saw Tartars leaning over the rail , their breath misting in the cold air , looking for her with dark alert eyes . All they saw was a hole in the snow . <p> Keeping still , she let her pursuers pass above her , then float away downwind . She counted to nine hundred , slowly , giving them plenty of time to leave . When she was sure it was safe she looked up , seeing nothing , no Blue-Eyes , no Tartars , just white blinding snow , stretching as far as she could see . Somewhere above her beyond the slanted snow field was the Firebird 's Nest . <p> She started out over the wet heavy snow , her oversized Tartar boots leaving big deep prints , a horribly obvious trail , easily seen from the air . Too bad . She was putting herself beyond such worries , climbing a snowclad volcanic peak in the heart of the Iron Wood , hundreds of leagues from food and shelter , with nothing to sustain her but rice balls and jerky . Cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Egg tighter , she marveled at how it held her up , taking away her pain  --  without it she doubted she could even stand , much less slog through wet snow . <p> Yet slog she did , over white snow field and a gray ash-covered glacier that groaned underfoot as Burning Mountain melted the ice from below . Great gaping cracks split the glacier , forcing her to cross unstable crevasses on tilted blocks of ice and cinder , tall dirty icebergs overlooking steaming craters filled with milky blue acid lakes . Gray glacier gave way to steep cinder slopes dusted with snow , leading up to the cone . Putting one foot in front of the other , she did not stop until she reached the crater top , and looked down into the vast steamy cauldron , feeling Burning Mountain 's hot sulfurous breath in her face . Below she could see her goal , a steaming acidic green lake bordered by clean white sand , and ringed by fiery wormholes leading down through the basalt to the hot column of magma that made the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystals , she celebrated by eating one of her rice balls , washing it down with handfuls of snow . Snow , air and rice ball all tasted of sulfur , and above her the Tartar sky-boats were back , circling like vultures . Winding downward through the hot updraft , the sky-boats could maneuver at will , even going upwind . Impressive , but they had to come much closer if they meant to get her . <p> Descending into the steaming cauldron , she negotiated slopes of slippery black grit and knee-deep volcanic ash , threaded by hot streams of melted snow bright green with algae  --  the first sign of life she had seen on the mountain . Fumaroles painted sulfur yellow and rust orange sent up roaring columns of searing toxic steam . Every so often one of the bigger vents would belch suffocating ash and poison gas , forcing her to bury her face in her sleeve until she could breathe again . At the bottom lay three steep cinder terraces , each wider than the last , ending in the white beach of shining volcanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wafted off the simmering chlorine-green lake , stinging her eyes and making her head swim . <p> Kneeling down , Katya dug into the white crystalline sand , hollowing out a warm hole ; then she untied the Firebird 's Egg , kissed it good-bye , and for the final time slid it into the ground , covering it up with sand . She had done it , returned the Egg to the Nest , completing her impossible quest . Hopefully the Bone Witch was happy . <p> Pain returned at once , nearly knocking her senseless . Collapsing into a heap on the sand , she lay groaning in agony , surprised at how much it hurt since the wound itself was nearly healed . Felled by pain and fatigue , she did not care to climb out of the crater and hike down the frozen mountain , dodging Tartar sky-boats on the way . She could see them now and then through the steam , vulture-like shadows circling closer . No thanks , unless the mountain really erupted , she was staying right here . <p> Slipping into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witch 's hut , the way it was before Prince Sergey burned it , with doves cooing in cool eaves formed by long white mammoth bones . The Bone Witch was there with her wild white mane , wearing her child-bone necklace and winding sheet dress , saying , " Well done , Katya , well done . " <p> Katya beamed in her sleep , happy to have done one thing right , despite horribly botching everything else , losing her knight and her life . " I tried . " <p> " I will miss you terribly , " the Bone Witch went on , looking fondly for once . " Though you were the death of me , you were a delight at the end of my much too long life . " <p> Fearing the witch was leaving , she asked , " What shall I do ? " <p> " Why , take care , my child . " The Bone Witch managed to sound kindly . " Always comfort the weak and dare to do right . Make me proud . " With that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warm sand shook , as the mountain stirred . She could hardly believe it . What a nightmare . Katya had finally gotten half-comfortable , sound asleep and barely in pain , and now Burning Mountain had started to erupt beneath her . Struggling awake , she rose painfully to all fours , as the chlorine green lake began to boil over , throwing up a thin hot acid rain that burned as it fell . Tartar sky-boats were racing off downwind , clearly having seen their fill . <p> Cinder slopes heaved around her , and sparks spewed upward , blowing away the acid rain . Glowing strands of lava flew through the air , trailing dark glassy threads that broke off and danced in the updraft . Glad to have her Tartar jacket , Katya shaded her eyes with her sleeve as a magnificent fireball shot into the sky , sending flames streaming in all directions . It was the Firebird , not the little flame jay that guided her and gave warning , but the huge magical bird itself , born in fire , and brighter than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept Katya from harm as fire fell out of the sky like snow . <p> Slowly the mountain subsided , shaking stopped , and nature turned quiet , as the newborn Firebird stood over her , bigger than the biggest roc , his rainbow plumage the color of fire ; crimson and ruby , blazing yellow , deep purple , lava orange and lightning white , with electric blue plumes around his big golden eyes . His head was next to her , and his long red tongue licked her wound . For a while she just lay there , marveling at the bright huge bird while his healing tongue licked her side . When he was done , the wound had healed and her pain was gone  --  so were the stitches , plucked out by the bird 's sharp bill . <p> Rising to her feet , she looked the Firebird full in the face , and he bent down to greet her , begging for affection the way sparrow nestlings did when she held them in her hand , thinking she must be their mother . Reaching up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Both she and the Firebird were orphans  --  but from now on they would have each other , and Katya told him so . " We will face the world side by side , since you are new to it , and I have been there . Together we can make the Bone Witch proud . " <p> He nodded his plumed head , showing he understood , and she saw herself reflected in a gold saucer-sized eye . Her hair had turned bone white in the fire , becoming a wild ivory tangle , just like the Bone Witch must have had when she was young . <p> Climbing onto the Firebird 's broad back , Katya found a spot where she could sit , sheltered by his plumage , with her legs straddling his neck . Leaning forward , she told the young bird to fly , and they took off , spiraling up into the great updraft rising from Burning Mountain  --  their first time in the air , but both took to it easily . Below black patches stained the snow , broken Tartar sky-boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasails ignited by the brilliance of the Firebird 's eruption . Katya the Bone Witch and the newborn Firebird flew triumphantly over them , winging away in search of her knight . <p> <p> By R. Garcia y Robertson <p>
