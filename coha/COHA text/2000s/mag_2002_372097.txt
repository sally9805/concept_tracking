Patriotism does not flow easily in Russia anymore . And if anyone has a right to shut his heart to Moscow , it is Slava Fetisov . The country 's greatest hockey hero throughout the 1980s , Fetisov , 43 , won two gold Olympic medals and one silver , seven world championships and the Order of Lenin . Yet Fetisov spent the late ' 80s being systematically harassed by his government . After being denied , year after year , the right to play in the National Hockey League as he had been promised , Fetisov decided to sue the U.S.S.R. for his freedom . <P> This was his first act of patriotism : refusing to defect . His reward : he was stripped of his team captaincy and given desk duty . He was threatened with exile to Siberia . He was beaten by government thugs . Using the Soviet court to sue the government , it turned out , was n't very effective . <P> Eventually , in 1989 , Fetisov was allowed by President Mikhail Gorbachev to emigrate and led the Detroit Red Wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey , where he works for the New Jersey Devils . Yet he has agreed to coach this year 's Russian Olympic team . For free . " It would be the easiest thing for me to turn my back . I have my family here . I have a nice house , " he says . " But I ca n't say no to the people of Russia . People who raised me , who gave me education  --  how can you deny them ? How are you going to be mad at the Russian people ? " <P> So Fetisov , who says he was privately recruited by President Vladimir Putin , took the job , and he now has to struggle with both the past and the present problems of Russian hockey . He must negotiate with the same hockey authorities who tried to derail him  --  and who still hate him for opening the floodgates out of Russia to the riches of the NHL for many players after him . Those players are now millionaire hockey stars , and although they owe their careers to Fetisov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for the Russian Olympic team but the dry spigot of Russian patriotism . <P> Four years ago , when NHL players entered the Olympics for the first time , many Russian players refused to play for the motherland . This year Florida Panthers player Pavel Bure , with the support of other Russian NHL players , lobbied for Fetisov to coach in a closed meeting with Putin . Soon after , Russian hockey execs buckled . So there 's nothing they would like to see more than Fetisov coming home without a medal . " I do n't want to get into details , but everything I try to do , they try to sabotage , " he says . " I was fighting for freedom and democracy , and I beat them in a legal way , and they still wo n't forget me . It 's been a long four months since I took this job . " <P> Fetisov did n't get help from all the players who brought about his appointment either . Three major NHL stars  --  the Maple Leafs ' Alexander Mogilny , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  are refuseniks . " Russia does n't mean anything for them anymore , " Fetisov says in disgust . " What about families who live there ? What about friends they have over there ? What about coaches who worked with them since they were 5 ? "
