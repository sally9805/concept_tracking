Spread the wealth ? Your interview with Daniel Finn ( " Can this market be saved , " March ) touched on a number of important issues - the common good , solidarity , subsidiarity- and made the excel- lent point that " free markets . . . exist in a context " that includes at least some government protection . At the same time , I do n't think it went far enough . Since the 19th century people such as Hilaire Belloc , G. K. Chesterton , Bishop Fulton Sheen , and Pope John Paul II have been warning us that the type of capitalism we have favors an uneven accumulation of wealth and purchasing power for those few who own the means of production . This imbalance tends to require state intervention , which gives inordinate power to bureaucrats . The only way to approach economic equilibrium ( and a truly free market ) is to favor an ownership society where the means of production are widely distributed-what Belloc and Chesterton called distributism . Moreover , this growing divide between capital and labor was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free trade has dismantled this country 's manufacturing base , the true wealth of nations . Consequently banks , lacking a productive economy in which to invest , have had to stay alive by making speculative loans . The problem , therefore , is structural and can not be fixed without implementing the wisdom of presidents such as Washington , Hamilton , Lincoln , and Theodore Roosevelt : re-establishing the " American system " of tariffs and other measures to support a fully homegrown economy . Jesse M. Yates Chardon , Ohio Daniel Finn is preaching moral hypocrisy when he says , " We must be very careful not to say that self-interest is wrong , " then argues that the second component of a just market is that the poor have a " right " to another 's property . This leads , as we are swiftly learning ( again ) , to an evolution of a government free to do anything . This inversion of power has always resulted in the darkest periods of human history , state rule by brute force . The goal of the Declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens against the use of its unlimited powers . The government envisioned for us in 1776 had three limited roles : police to protect us from criminals ( those who abuse private property rights ) ; the armed forces to protect our property from foreign invaders ; and courts to settle disputes among free men according to objective laws . The deviation of our government from these limited principles is leading us back into the lawlessness of absolute tyranny . Finn and the Catholic Church , when it erroneously speaks of the " common good , " are co-conspirators in this effort to further diminish the freedom of the citizens of the United States . Ken Kodger Avon Lake , Ohio Me , too I read Karen Kirkwood 's " Catholic Confidential " ( March ) article with tears in my eyes . As a convert from the Baptist persuasion more than 40 years ago , I still feel like an outsider in the church despite the kindness and acceptance of Catholic friends . To me the church often seems so unlike anything Jesus ever considered founding . Yet I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they look at me like I 'm demented . I continue to stay because I ca n't stay away . Like St. Peter , when I consider leaving , I always end up asking myself , " Where else shall I go ? " Why it draws me , I 'm still not sure . It seems to supply something I yearn for . As Kirkwood suggests , this may be the only thing that continually prods converts like us on . Al Murdach Hayward , Calif . " Catholic Confidential " was wonderfully insightful . I ca n't speak for any other Catholic , but I relate to many of Karen Kirkwood 's experiences . All any of us can say is , " Lord , here I am . " I hope to read more of her thoughts . Craig Kelso Paso Robles , Calif . I rejoice that Karen Kirkwood followed her heart to the Catholic Church , but I 'm sorry she opted for private instruction over the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults . The RCIA process is designed to help new Catholics through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mass to feelings of isolation . When prospective Catholics commit to sharing their journey with each other - including their questions and doubts- they experience the church at its most welcoming . Maybe it 's not too late for Kirkwood to check out the RCIA at her parish . Mollie Wilson O'Reilly New York , N.Y . Eternal entrance exam ? I probably am a conventional or orthodox Catholic in that I believe in heaven , angels , hell , and the devil ( " What 's after life ? " Reader Survey , March ) . Regarding purgatory , I do n't see how anyone can deny there must be a cleansing process before God welcomes us into heaven . Do we spend time in some kind of a reform school , as was the popular belief when we were kids ? I 'm not so sure . Eternity is timeless , after all . But we must be perfect when we enter heaven , so one way or another God will cleanse us . Perhaps it 's by some means we have n't even thought about , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the imperfections we must shed . Whether or not all the indulgence tickets we 've saved up - each allegedly worth 300 days - prove valid , we must be purified when we meet our Creator . Bill Cahill Wheaton , III . Give up something else ! As a farmer and rancher producing food from the earth , I am appalled by the way some in the Catholic Church choose food as the main source of penance during Lent ( " Fast break , " The Examined Life , March ) . The agricultural economy is in no better shape than the stock market at this time . We who produce the world 's food supply have costs that must be met . Why do n't you suggest instead that no automobiles or gas may be purchased on Ash Wednesday , the Fridays of Lent , or Good Friday ? Denying food producers a constant just market price may lead to less food availability in the future . We as farmers can no longer continue to produce and sell food to maintain a livelihood if the church tells the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear in the daily farm commodity market that livestock prices are trending lower due to the start of Lent . Maybe the church is the real sinner for denying the " steward producer " a just livelihood . Robert Thullner Herreid , S.D.
