Despite the current economic downturn , the number of U.S. households with a net worth of $5 million or more grew so much during the past decade that high-net-worth Americans are still at record levels of affluence . Increasingly , these millions of baby boomers  --  who primarily earned their money the hard way , by themselves rather than by inheriting it  --  have wrestled with how to nurture their children 's empathy and work ethic . They worry about their offspring growing up with a sense of entitlement . " Money has become a challenge for many families , " says consultant Ellen Remmer , who works with wealthy families at the Boston-based Philanthropic Initiative ( tpi.org ) . The challenges of raising children in affluent circumstances are persuading parents , mothers in particular , to bring families into meetings to talk about fears , share stories , become educated and listen to advice . " In the past few years , I 've been approached by many more women looking to take the journey of helping their families focus on the range of resources , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose clients are high-net-worth families and family businesses . " They want to understand their family values and mission . This is n't transactional . They 've done the estate planning . Now they 're trying to prepare the next generation to have discussions about money and understand the basics of financial education . " Even so , teaching kids about financial values and the lessons of giving has little to do with how much wealth the family controls . One of the most effective ways to educate your children is one of the simplest : model the behavior you want to see in them . Let Them Decide Many donors want their kids to participate in family-giving plans but take their interest for granted and wo n't give them any real authority . Try to avoid hovering , nagging or putting strings on their choices . Let kids go about the process in their own way . If it seems a tad out of control , pull in a knowledgeable third party who can be objective . Keep listening . If you want the next generation to grow into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . For example , Shirley Fredricks , daughter of entertainer Lawrence Welk , ran the family 's foundation for some seventeen years , actively supporting Southern California communities in need . " We created a junior board and brought on the ten kids in 1983 , " says Fredricks . At the time , the youngest was fourteen and the oldest , twenty-four . " The junior board , " she says , " was allowed to sit in on board meetings and vote 10 percent of the grant budget . But they had to do due diligence on the organizations they funded , including research and follow-up visits . " Increasingly , families are setting up discretionary funds for offspring , who may be scattered around the country , so that the younger generation can support causes they choose in their own communities . And while parent-child tensions are inevitable as the lessons sink in , there are ways to defuse them . A few years back , for instance , Ellen Remmer wanted her teenagers  --  then fifteen and seventeen  --  to experience not simply the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted my kids to learn about making a good grant , not necessarily to find the most important issue in the world to help . " She set up a meeting for the family with a facilitator at Boston 's community foundation . Most of these public charities , as well as many private banks and financial-services firms , will offer such help if you 're a donor or client or if you might become one . The family 's first hurdle in meeting with the facilitator was to reach a consensus about a category of giving that would engage them all  --  an area everyone felt was worthy to fund . That took some weeks of discussion , with each family member assigned to researching and reporting back on specific subjects . Eventually , the family arrived at an area of interest that excited all of them : services for new immigrants to Boston , along with programs that taught English as a second language . " We came together in our interest in education , " says Remmer . " My son talked about groups that help people pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help themselves . My daughter wanted to focus on women in need . And my husband thought that funding immigrant education gave us the biggest bang for our buck . " The process had its ups and downs and dragged on as the teenagers moved in and out of focus , says Remmer . " I had to keep reminding myself that it was about developing a template for good giving and not about giving together . " After making several site visits , the family narrowed its choices down to two organizations , with each teen arguing for his or her favorite . In the end , they compromised , giving each group $7,500 . Keep Kids Grounded Consider the choices of parents like Meg Whitman , who ran the online auction behemoth eBay for a decade before stepping down in March 2008 ( she is currently a candidate for governor of California ) . In 2007 , Forbes estimated Whitman 's worth at $1.4 billion . But as her net worth skyrocketed with the success of eBay , Whitman and her husband , Griffith Harsh , a neurosurgeon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live on a day-to-day basis , " she says . They wanted to demonstrate their values for their two sons . " Kids take their cues from their surroundings , including the house you live in , the car you drive , what you do together as a family , " says Whitman . So through the years when their two sons attended high school and college , the couple drove a Jeep Grand Cherokee and a hybrid . They chose not to trade up . " We live in a very nice Colonial-style house , but it 's modest by Silicon Valley standards , " says Whitman . Those parental decisions were validated not long ago , when her older son mentioned that staying in their house while he was in high school and not buying a bigger home made a " huge difference " for him , because he never felt uncomfortable among his friends . There are other ways to communicate values to your kids . In 2002 , Whitman donated $30 million to build a new residential college at Princeton that opened its doors in 2007 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than men do , " she says about the gift . " I wanted to change the averages . " Look to Your Legacy When thinking about how to set up a legacy for yourself and the next generation , think big picture . Figure out what you own , what you want to accomplish and what it will take to make that happen . Saving on taxes is n't the goal . " You want to provide a legacy , not necessarily a financial inheritance , " explains Melanie Schnoll Begun , managing director for philanthropic services at Citi Global Wealth Management ( **28;2904;TOOLONG ) . " Tax implications should come second . " A donor-advised fund can support a favored charity . Special endowments can bankroll foundations or causes . Trusts or investments can subsidize the dreams of loved ones and friends . As you make estate and charitable plans , you also need to consider how to manage assets for your heirs . " People who have worked hard for their wealth are very torn about how to pass it on , " says Alyssa Moeder , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group ( ml.com ) . " The biggest question I get during estate planning is ' What 's the magic number ? How much should I leave to the kids ? ' " You may decide to rely on financial vehicles that hold the money in trust in some way so that the next generation is supported but does n't have unlimited access . A 529 college-savings program , for instance , can shelter money for qualified educational expenses . There are also health-insurance trusts that can cover medical emergencies and the widely known irrevocable trusts . Such arrangements can be structured to kick in over time , triggered by various life events or circumstances . You will need advisers to steer you through the complicated scenarios . Each state has different estate laws and taxes . If you own assets in more than one state , the process becomes multilayered . " People need long-term relationships with estate-planning advisers who offer consistency and continuity , " says trust adviser Patricia Angus . " Otherwise , they end up with different documents by different people . " Grow With the Flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents and children do n't always think alike . And when it comes to passing on the values , mission and financial control of a family 's giving plan , things can get especially tricky . Ashley Snowdon Blanchard is in her early thirties , married with a new baby , and a philanthropy consultant in New York at the TCC Group ( tccgrp.com ) . She jumped the hurdles of passing on a legacy through steady perseverance . In 1959 her great-grandfather Arthur Hill established the family 's Hill-Snowdon Foundation ( hillsnowdon.org ) , now based in Washington , D.C. He had built up assets as an executive at Johnson &; Johnson by receiving stock options in lieu of salary during World War II . Still , " we did n't really have that much money until the enormous rise in J &J; stock in the 1990s , " says Blanchard . She recalls family members sitting around a kitchen table each year to decide where the foundation 's grants would go . " Everyone had their own particular organizations and causes . It was n't thought out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in assets , Blanchard began attending foundation meetings as a young adult . " What had worked for people around the table did n't make sense for the next generation , and we brought a critical view to the status quo . We could put forth ideas without dipping into anyone 's pot . " In the meantime , Blanchard had graduated from Stanford and studied nonprofit management and social-welfare policy at UC Berkeley . " I came of age when welfare reform was a hot-button social issue . The other huge issue was women 's balancing act , the ' second shift ' they worked at home . It was clearly a myth that women could do it all . Ultimately , that led me to social change and philanthropy . " It was time for the forty-year-old foundation to grow up . To help with the transition , the family worked closely with consultants from the Tides Foundation ( tides.org ) , which counsels families and individuals about charitable plans . Within a few years , Blanchard had become president of the board , working , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on a consistent mission of social change and economic justice . Nowadays , the staff-driven Hill-Snowdon Foundation , with its $32 million endowment ( as of year-end 2008 ) and annual grants of about $2 million , is " on cruise control . " Blanchard works with the executive director to set agendas and keep the family informed and engaged . And she 's begun to mentor the next generation , a young cousin who recently became a trustee . " We learn by doing , " she says . THREE WAYS TO DEVELOP THE HABIT OF GIVING Clearly , kids need a firm foundation for spending and saving before they can even contemplate giving . By helping them define money 's value and reach and untangle it from guilt or discomfort , you set the stage for the rewards and responsibilities of lifelong giving . What follows are pointers from experienced advisers and affluent parents about how to instill a sense of identity , productivity and , ultimately , compassion in kids . Many of these lessons overlap , of course . And you 'll also need to evaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of growth . 1 TEACH THE VALUE OF A BUCK Start a routine of dividing your children 's weekly or monthly allowance into three pots : for spending , saving and giving . Very young kids can use jars to make the experience more tangible . This not only builds the habits of saving and giving but also helps develop money-management skills . Consider , too , the emotional impact of money . When they 're young , make sure your kids know the value of money and let them know they may have to pay their own way , which will push them to make grown-up choices . Wealth can be a burden , and kids have a better chance to create their own lives when they act on their own . Hold a family meeting , and collaborate with your kids to draft a family compact or mission statement , with the idea that it will last for a few generations . Such meetings typically cover open discussions about the source of the family 's money , how family members view their responsibilities about wealth , potential giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The process helps everyone accommodate different opinions and visions . Set up regular times to review how family members are meeting the mission or goals you 've established . " If you do n't manage the emotional and family aspects , the money does n't matter , " says Susan Remmer Ryzewic , Ellen Remmer 's sister , who oversees the finances of the Remmer Family Foundation ( ehrinv.com/rff.htm ) , in Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida . For the wealthy , such meetings are becoming two- or three-day retreats that bring together branches of the extended family . " Wealth creates emotional hurdles , and I 've had to deal with both my issues and my kids ' issues , " says Ryzewic , whose family came into its fortune when it sold her father 's engineering business . " If you want to maintain the family legacy and not have it fall apart , it helps to uncover and figure out how to manage and resolve differences . " 2 PROVIDE LESSONS IN MONEY MANAGEMENT Spend time talking to your kids about the issues of values and financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you research or review opportunities or big-ticket purchases . Do your children know how you arrive at major financial decisions ? Set up some kind of coaching sessions to tutor your kids in money management , whether on your own or with an outside adviser . Work with advisers who understand and talk about the emotional issues of money , not just the investment side of things . You can also start taking the kids to meetings with your advisers  --  including tax accountants or money and investment managers  --  from , say , age fourteen or so . That way they can learn about financial issues , see what it takes to assemble a good team of advisers and become comfortable with the process of evaluating choices and making decisions on issues ranging from saving and investing to developing philanthropic plans and giving . 3 GET THE KIDS INVOLVED IN GIVING Donors and parents who have been there and done it offer this advice : *Involve children early . Youngsters can volunteer to gather food , clothing or toys for needy groups . *Encourage your kids to save and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out how they want to donate the money set aside for giving . *Ask your kids to help you research your own contributions , whether online , at a library or over the phone . *Depending on the ages of your children , require the real deal  --  research , site visits , financial reviews , conversations with the nonprofit 's staff and grantees , and oversight for results and impact . *Create annual holiday rituals for community service or giving . It does n't have to be complicated . The family can simply volunteer to help deliver food for Thanksgiving , host a fundraising party for the local school or shelter , or collect clothing for the needy .
