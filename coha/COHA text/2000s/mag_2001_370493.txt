In 1990 , when the members of the San Diego pop-punk trio Blink-182 were teens , punk rock was composed by outcasts for outcasts  --  it was music about being abnormal . The title of a song by English punks UK Subs said it all : You Do n't Belong . <P> The overall message of Blink-182 's new CD , Take Off Your Pants and Jacket ( MCA ) , can be summed up as " You belong . " This is a form of punk that tries to speak to jocks as strongly as it speaks to weirdos . The simplicity , profanity and high velocity associated with punk rock are all in place , but the subject matter is often the stuff of Freddie Prinze Jr . movies . Nearly every song is concerned with a universal adolescent experience : a terrifying first date ; a holiday with grotesque relatives ; a romance at a rock concert . Anthem Part Two presumes to whine on behalf of everybody under 18 : " Corporate leaders , politicians/ Kids ca n't vote , adults elect them ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As John McCain does with the G.O.P. , singer/guitarist Tom DeLonge , 25 , singer/bassist Mark Hoppus , 29 , and drummer Travis Barker , 25 , want to make punk a big tent . <P> The problem is that to make its punk rock accessible , Blink-182 coats the music with studio effects until it 's too smooth to evoke the miseries of high school . The tirades against priggish adults on this CD are unconvincing because the music seems afraid to offend the ears of stuffy establishment types . If you 're so screwed up , one wants to ask , how come you sound so well adjusted ? <P>  --  By Benjamin Nugent
