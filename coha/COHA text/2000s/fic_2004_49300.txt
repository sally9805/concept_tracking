postcard text I am awfully fond of this garden . How pretty are those plants &; flowers ! There is a grotto in this garden I was afraid to enter as it is too dark there , but at last decided . It is full of passages , the water runs over the walls outside . With best wishes Yours sincerely Clara <p> It was in the spring of 1914 , while I still had salvia and hydrangeas and dahlias in bloom , that I went to Egypt . I had not left Mother 's house for a long while . That is to say , not overnight . Her soul had passed into the bosom of God through her Savior Jesus in 1910 . And yet , of course , much of her had remained with me . I decided to forego seeing my plumbago and my oleander . I decided to whisper a goodbye to Mother for just a little while . There was a brief ceremony , I suppose you could call it . I stood before the window seat where mornings she drank her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains would stir and she would draw one to the side and turn her face to the street . The Seth Thomas ticked heavily on the mantel . I said softly , " Surely it 's of little matter to you now , dear . I will do this thing . " She would not have understood . Though it is only a few dozen miles away , she considered even Mobile to be a foreign land . I stood at the window of my room at the Savoy Palace Hotel on the rue de la Porte de Rosette and I drew back the heavy linen curtain and there was no breeze but only a welter of voices from the street . My companions were laid low in other rooms about the hotel . I had not clearly understood how sturdy my constitution is until the other half dozen of us from the Ladies Literary Society and Garden Club of Bovary had wilted instantly at sea and by the time we arrived at Alexandria were still declaring , quite convincingly , that their deaths were imminent . The few married couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them were on a regimen of bismuth cachets , and some were taking quinine as well . I myself had stood on the rolling deck of the Laconia and put my face into the sting of ocean spray and waited for the sickness to befall me , but it did not . Not that I am without my frailties . The voices from the street below frightened me , terribly , as did the dark men in maroon fezzes and crimson sweaters that morning at the docks , all of them crying out at once , " Cook 's tour man ! " and " Cook 's here ! " and " Me Cooks ! " As I understand it , few of them actually were from Thomas Cook and Son . They were full of pretense for the chance to carry your things away , perhaps never to be seen again . I was glad to have our own tour guide to shepherd us through this chaos , though he was a coarse man , provided by the agency in Mobile , who seemed simply to have memorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked into our bags . He needed to understand we were part of a literary society , many of us . We were capable of reading and had done so in our preparations . I had some little difficulty in breathing as I stood at my window in Alexandria that first day . The air was fetid , the din unceasing . I let the curtain fall . I fended off the thought that Mother was right about the world . The noise would have been sufficient to make her nod with closed eyes , the gesture alone saying , There , Clara , see what I mean . What would soon transpire in this city far away would have truly alarmed her . I was myself alarmed after Mother passed . Not long before , Halley 's Comet had finally dimmed from view . It was a warm , early summer evening . The door was open to the yard , and the smell of the Confederate Jasmine filled the kitchen where I sat alone at the table , her body laid to rest with our pastor 's reassurances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last from our house , the countertops filled with brought food . I could hear the clock ticking in the parlor . A dog barked somewhere in the distance . The rooms above me were silent . I was forty-five years old . I never married . Father long ago left the two of us , Mother and me , well provided for . I had only to care for the woman who 'd borne me and to tend the garden we both loved . Now there was only the garden . The ticking of the clock . To sit in the heavy fragrance of the jasmine and later the summer roses and later the smell of burning leaves and autumn coming on , and then , with winter , the tight smells of the house , the soap and the coal smoke and the starch . I could not imagine a winter of silence in this house . I began to weep , and I trembled inside much as later , in Alexandria , I trembled from a state of things quite the opposite of all that , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rotting food . I turned away from the hotel window . I had gently asserted the privilege my father had given me . I had arranged to occupy a room alone on my grand tour . The enforced physical company of other women in a similar state of life offered me no comfort , I 'm sorry to say . They were clinging to each other even now . I did enjoy to read the same books as they . To speak together of flowers and fertilizers . I removed the white lawn waist and voile skirt that I had determined would be my traveling uniform , and I lay down on the bed in my chemise . An electrical fan hummed beside me on the nightstand . The air moved across my face and my neck . Be still , Mama . In spite of the warmth of Egypt in spring , I shivered . My first night I woke in the dark and there was only silence in the room . I thought Mother had stopped breathing . I sat up and would have called for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blessed , and so far uncharacteristic , silence . I went back to sleep . But I woke once more , to a lone voice crying out . A faint light was seeping into my room from the window . This time there was no confusion . Mother was long since dead . I was halfway round the world . The voice was a male voice but high-pitched , rising sharply and stretching out his words , long and ardent , and then falling to rise instantly again . It was , I knew from my preparation , a muezzin calling the Mohammedan faithful to prayer . I turned on my side away from the window , putting my face into the air from the electric fan , and I said the Lord 's Prayer over and over until the voice outside ceased and I was asleep once more . The next day one of the couples , from Mobile , whom I did not know , and one of my fellow literary ladies-Alice Fay Miller , a librarian at the Carnegie in our town-were ready to try their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , our tour guide declined to hire a local dragoman but , rather , took us out himself . Consequently , I listened to nothing that was said . Whenever he would look my way as he muttered through his vague memories of Baedeker , I would lower my face slightly and he would vanish beyond the roll brim of my Panama hat . He was , however , efficient in securing the appropriate horse-drawn cabs for us . I credited him with that . I spent the day trying to calm my unease at the boisterousness of the streets . Wherever we passed , these people , dark of face and voluminously becloaked , were carrying on their lives in the streets , and there was much shouting and waving of arms and , as we passed , lifting and hawking of goods . Fezzes and postcards and shawls and embroidered cloths and woven baskets and pistachio nuts and dried fish and one man offered a parrot from his arm and another a monkey on a leash crying , " Buy monkey please , he is your Egyptian friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had no goods to sell , also beseeching us loudly for money , often , in appearance , no different whatsoever from those who at least offered something in return for what they asked . Those who clearly were much worse off , maimed or sick or truly destitute , quieter in their plea , made me uncomfortable in the show of our privilege , though we had been strictly instructed by the Egyptian hotel staff to resist giving money to any of these . And there were others I could not block out , either , though they made no sound whatsoever . The women . We passed a donkey cart with a man leading , and inside were half a dozen Mohammedan women wrapped in their burkas so only their eyes could be seen , dark eyes turning to me and to Alice and the other woman in our cab , wondering , I daresay , at the nakedness of our faces . And thinking what of us ? That we were brazen ? A shame to God ? Wicked and worldly ? How little they could know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . The man who had just struck his donkey with a rod looked at us , too , and I refused his appraisal , turning instantly away . These were the worst times for me during the day , of course , as I moved through the streets , the times when I felt most keenly the absence of that other rhythm of life I 'd always known in our house on Wilkinson Avenue . How deeply those years had shaped me . Not that I 'd come to Egypt simply to find a quainter Alabama . But I was feeling keenly my own limitations . The limitations of an Old South spinster born the year that the war of secession ended , the Northern President was assassinated , and the Southern President was captured dressed as a woman . Two of these three events had always been forbidden as topics of conversation in my mother 's home . As was , of course , the emancipation of a whole latent nation among us of people enslaved from this very continent , which also occurred in the year I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter topic was also forbidden . From shame for that particular Southern institution , I hoped . But it is quite possible my father and my mother regretted its passing , or , at best , regretted the relinquishing of the state-centered rights that helped perpetuate it . Even away from the clamor of the streets , I was keenly conscious of who I 'd always been . Before Pompey 's Pillar , a red granite column seventeen hundred years old , as tall as the tallest building in Mobile , my eyes would not quit straying to the wide scattering of rubbish all around , some of it the broken fragments of other antiquities , some of it clearly the detritus of modern times , nameless things of stone and cement and rotted wood . This was as shameful to me as perhaps my naked face was to the Mohammedan women who passed in their cart . My lawn , my garden , my house , were immaculately neat . At the Catacombs of Kom esh-Shukafa , down a winding wooden staircase in a circular light-shaft , the chill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty crypts shaped deep in the stone walls , heavily shadowed from the electric lights , and I thought only of Mother . Mother in the plain pine box she 'd asked for . The lid closing to the ages . Was she presently shocked to find herself a fellow citizen somewhere with the Alexandrine soul whose remains once lay in this hollowed stone ? This was not necessarily an ominous consideration . There were many early Christians in Alexandria . At the Museum of Greco-Roman Antiquities my guidebook translated the words on the Coptic tombstones as , " Be not sad ; no one on the earth is immortal . " I wondered if , on the contrary , that was n't the very reason to be sad . And in another room was the mummy of a Roman woman , her rather plain face painted on the head of the wrappings , her body deep within , but the cloth was torn away at the bottom where the bare toes of her left foot were visible , gray and wrinkled , and I was embarrassed for her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be mortified to have my bare feet made visible to anyone . I despise the shape of my own toes . These were not the thoughts of one whose horizons have been broadened by travel . Deep into the afternoon we were intending to return to the hotel , but our guide , to his credit , heeded the suggestion of our cab driver and took us first to a vast public garden along the main canal leading from the west harbor . We stepped down at the stone-arbored entrance , and after the puffing of the horses subsided , I was struck by a clean , sudden silence , the silence of growing things . We drifted through the archway , and inside , we faced a wide , rolling green expanse with quite a large pond and paths and splashings of floral color here and there and ringed about with higher ground and , far off among its trees , what seemed to be the fragment of an ancient wall . Nearby was an empty bandstand , and beside it , an active cafe . My companions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved off toward the cafe . The guide trailed along until he noticed I was n't following . He stopped and took a step back in my direction . " Miss Summerfield ? " he said . " I 'm going to explore a bit , " I said . " I should come along , " he said . " No . " I 'm afraid my reply carried my disregard for him in its firmness . " It 's simply a garden , Mr. Fisk , " I said , trying to soften my voice . He looked at me dumbly . " I insist , " I said . " Very well , " he said , and he hurried along to the cafe , no doubt relieved to be acquitted of his responsibility . I had not thought to feel uneasy walking in an Egyptian garden alone until this foolish man raised the issue . I recognized a faint fluttering in my chest now , but I considered the source and put it out of my mind . Besides , there were very few other people visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things rooted in the ground had always been friendly with me . I followed the main path along the irregular edge of the pond and wandered off , now and then , to stands of jacaranda and eucalyptus and sycamore and to a great gathering of oleanders , massive oleanders taller than a house , and to lovely runs of roses , musk roses and off-white roses I did n't recognize , and then , in a little dip of the green , around a curve of the path , I was astonished to find a profusion of Madame Pierre Oger , her pink cups nodding at me as if from my own backyard . I approached the nearest shrub and bent to her and I cradled one of her blooms in my hand . It was a dark pink , verging on red , darker than mine ever were . " What is it , dear lady ? " I said to her , low . " This place has you wrought up , does it ? " I lingered with her for a time . She was a sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormal impulse in a long-established other rose . Madame Oger 's immaculate mother was La Reine Victoria . I was filled with a kind of tenderness about her that I often felt in my own garden . Her scent was heavy about me , like ripe pears . I was reluctant to leave her , but I felt my qualms about Egypt were being pruned away in this place and I wanted more of that . I went on along the path , coming up to some poinsettia trees that were thick and dark . I wished I 'd seen them in bloom , though if I had , my dear Madame Oger would have then been sleeping , and I was very happy for her reassurance . I moved through the poinsettias , Christmas in Alabama beginning to slip in at the edge of my thoughts . But the air now was still and warm . I put away Christmas . I was growing easy with the notion that I was in another country . As I moved toward the far reaches of the garden , a sound was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of falling water . I came round a bend by the lake , thick with boscage , and I found its source . Water poured over a stone wall that emerged from the trees at the side of the hill that rimmed the garden . And nearby was a portal , dark in shadow . It seemed at first glance to lead straight into the side of the hill . But among all the growth above and around and beyond the opening , I noticed hints of the asphalt paper that was laid over something , trellis work or cement or stone , that embowered quite a large space . It was a man-made grotto . How lovely , I told myself . How exotic . But I hesitated , surprised at an almost desperate clutching that had begun inside me . I was reminded , perhaps , of the dark openings of the crypts at the catacombs earlier in the day . I forced myself to take a step , and another . I tried to see this as an entry-way into the very midst of all the verdancy around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave . An unnatural one , at that . Perhaps they had some dark-growing things within , but it would be mostly stone and hard surface . And the entrance was very dark . I turned to go . What made me reconsider ? I 'm not entirely sure . I did hesitate once more . No doubt there was some undercurrent of the determined traveler in me . No one had forced me to leave Alabama , to pack a steamer trunk and board a ship and come to the African continent . I 'd had enough of the silence of my house , enough of the momentum of my everyday life that rolled on as if Mother were still upstairs or as if she had never existed . Either condition would have left me doing the same spinstery things in an endless succession of mornings and afternoons and evenings . Standing now with the grotto entry behind me and the path back to the cafe and my fellow travelers ahead of me , I must have yearned for some break with what had gone before . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all . A tourist 's cave . I turned and squared myself up , pressed my Panama hat firmly to my head , drew my handbag to my chest , and I strode forward and into the dark gape of the grotto . My first thought was that this is how it feels to die . A chill and a hush and a distant rush of water and dim striations all about of unfamiliar stone . I was not frightened . The thought was a calm one , a mundane one , even , like turning over an unusual root in the garden , something growing unseen . And it soon faded . I had a choice of paths , one to the right and one straight ahead . I assumed , as I gathered my traveler 's courage , that either direction would ultimately wind back to this spot , so I moved forward . Soon the path bent to the left and there was grainy tufa rock all around me and a pale electric-bulb light casting the tapered shadows of faux stalactites against the walls . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chest . I clutched harder there with my handbag , but I was keenly conscious of my withdrawal from the world . I knew the tufa rock , for I had used it some years ago in a corner of my own garden to create a small fountain , idle now , neatly kept though inoperative . So the rock seemed familiar and I focused on that . I walked faster , the rasp of my footsteps echoing thinly . And then I turned another corner into a chamber and a heavily cloaked figure was before me . I gasped . A face turned to look over a shoulder . A dark face , an Egyptian man , tightly turbaned , with a dense black mustache and large dark eyes that considered me matter-of-factly . He was sitting on a stone bench before a wall with water sheeting down into a narrow pond . He seemed massive to me somehow . The typical layered cloaks he wore had seemed on other Egyptian men to encase a much smaller person . But this man was broad of shoulder and gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreated a step . He leaped to his feet and turned to face me . I stumbled backward some more . " Please , " he said . " I am sorry . I mean not to frighten you , dear lady . " He spoke clear English , though bearing , oddly , both a latent rhythm of his native Arabic and , in pronunciation , a distinctly British accent . I was happy for his English but not at all comfortable hearing him call me a " dear lady . " Still , he bowed his head at me , and my mind calmed even as my heart fluttered heavily on . He came round the bench and made a grand , sweeping gesture at it . " Please . You arrive to a very charming place . " Once again I found myself suspended in the struggle between my fear of new things and my wish for them . " I was just passing through , " I said . " You may sit for a while , " he said . " You may think peaceful thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read me . " I am going , " he said . " You will stay alone . " It was a respectful offer . I credited him with that . And it prompted a similar feeling in me . Either way now , I would offend the man . If I were myself to go on or if I were to encourage him to go , he would surely think I was being critical of his presence . I knew from long practice how to correct the social awkwardness in a room . I straightened and came forward , making my steps firm , approaching him so that he could see nothing but confidence in me . " You must not go , " I said . " I will sit on one end of the bench and be peaceful , and you will sit on the other and resume your own thoughts . " I went promptly to the far end and sat down . If he had not been here I would have done no such thing . I tried to calculate how long I needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a rustle , and in the faint edge of my peripheral vision I watched him sit . I folded my hands over the bag in my lap and stared at the scattered points of reflected electric light in the flat tumble of water on the wall before me . " Pumps , " he said . This made me turn my face to him , in spite of my resolve simply to sit and feign peaceful thoughts for a brief time as if he were not here . " I beg your pardon ? " " I am sorry , " he said . " I have interrupted . " " It 's all right , " I said . " Pumps , " he said . " The water . " He turned his face to the wall . " They use pumps , " I said . " Yes , " he said , looking back to me . " You understand . " " I do , " I said . " It is my official duty to explain , " he said . I was further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's motives for lingering here . But the formal sanction of his presence made it easier now to return my gaze to the cascade and begin to count in my head to a hundred , at which time I would depart . " Is there some other question you have ? " he said . I looked at him . He had offered an opportunity to think peacefully . If I had , in fact , been so inclined , he was making that impossible . But I felt a hypocrite . I had been seeking no such thing . What had I been seeking ? Here was a local inhabitant who spoke English and who was prepared to enlighten me in surely the very ways I had sought in coming abroad . But nothing came to mind . And I supposed he was merely soliciting questions about the grotto . After which , he would no doubt expect money for his information . He would turn into a hawker , lifting tourist-spot information in his hands at a passing cab . And he still frightened me , I realized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling foolish in my dumbness as this little string of contradictory thoughts gabbled its way through my head . " It is all right , dear lady , " he said , as if reading my thoughts . " I will not interrupt you again . " But of course he did not read my thoughts . He had a certain social perceptiveness , though he had himself created the awkwardness . " It 's not an interruption , " I said . " I could n't think of anything to ask . It 's a grotto . " " Yes , " he said . " I know what you mean . I find it rather dull myself . " " I 'm not being critical . " " You are very kind to say this , but it is Masud-this is me-that is being critical . It is not a natural place . It is for the tourist . " " I am a tourist , " I said . " I do not mean insult to the dear lady , " he said with a rush . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do ? " " I learn English from the English , " he said , shrugging . " They conquered my country and they teach us what they wish us to know . They treat us like rather stupid children . But we learn these things because we must survive . I work for some years in an English bank . " He looked at me , pausing , I think , to assess what he had just said . He had not dealt with the essence of my question . He shrugged again . " You see now the reason I no longer work in an English bank . I speak what is in my heart . " " Do you value this quality ? " I asked . " To speak what is in your heart ? " " It is how Allah made me , " he said . " Then may I say that it causes discomfort to a woman to be addressed as " dear lady " by a stranger ? " He furrowed his brow to take this in . " I believe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I heard these words said by the English . " I realized at once the problem . I was sorry to have broached the subject . If this had been an English banker in collar and three-piece suit , I could instantly have been a " dear lady " and thought nothing about it . " Of course , " I said . " I understand . " He rose abruptly . I must have flinched , for he grew solicitous . " I am sorry . Yes , " he said , " I will leave you . . . " He hesitated very briefly , suppressing another " dear lady , " I 'm sure . " You can have now your peaceful thoughts . " I should have let him go . But once again I felt I was causing offense . " No . Please , " I said . " I did not mean to complain . It was a small semantic point . I was prompted by your courage to speak one 's heart . " I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled and sat down again . As soon as he did , however , I thought of how he must see me . In my preparations I had read what these people believe . He could call a woman from the infidel culture " dear lady " because she was already , automatically , so far outside the boundaries of moral behavior that it did not matter . My face should be hidden . I had no place in public alone . I looked at the thin veil of water before me . I determined to wait a few moments only and then leave . I did not belong here . And with this , Mother whispered in my head . You see , dear . My dear Clara . My dear daughter . There is no place in the wider world for you , not for either of us . Then I could see her . Her face was turned to the thin sheeting of water down the window . The wider world had long since ceased to be an issue . It was raining heavily but quietly . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now it was just the flow of water down the windowpane . She watched from her pillow . I sat beside the bed , the soup bowl still full in my hands , burning faintly at my palms . She 'd taken only a few spoonfuls . I knew she would die soon . She watched the rain and I watched her watching the rain , her eyes sunken now , her face gaunt , a woman I had to struggle to recognize . Finally I turned to see what she was seeing . The lace curtains . The blur of water . Nothing visible beyond . I began to tremble now , in the grotto . As I had the day she would not eat her soup and she would not acknowledge me with her eyes . " Mother , " I said , looking back to this face , though I had nothing to say to her . I just wanted her to see me instead of the water on the window . " Mother , " I said . " Yes , dear ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I waited . There was only the sound of rushing water . And I began to weep . I bowed my head in the grotto in Alexandria and I wept . I quickly pulled a handkerchief from my handbag and covered my face . It smelled of Yardley 's lavender , my mother 's smell . It was my smell , too . I knew I should rise up now and rush down the corridor and out of this place . But I did not have the strength . I was weeping and trying not to make a sound . It was n't easy . The image of Mother had vanished from my head and my most conscious part focused on not sobbing . A stranger-this Egyptian man-was nearby and I tried to summon my strength to leave , but it was all I could do to moderate the spectacle . " Have I somehow caused this ? " he said . " No , " I said , shifting my handkerchief only enough to see him . " No . . . I should leave . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . Perhaps . . . since I ca n't seem to go . . . for some reason . . . " I was short of breath and my voice would not hold steady to speak . " Yes , " he said , rising once again . " I understand . I , Masud , will go . " Twice before he had offered this , sincerely and appropriately , and both times the offer had led me to encourage him to stay . This time I did not stop him , but neither did he go . And then , unexpectedly , I said , " I have n't done this for her . Not properly . " I covered up again and wept on for a time , not thinking of Mother , really , not thinking at all . At some point I sensed his return to the bench . And then , finally , the tears began to slow and I lowered my hands from my face . I knew he was closer to me now . I glanced . He was being very discreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's length away . He seemed a nice enough man . " My mother , " I said . " She died . " He spoke something quicldy , almost to himself , in Arabic . Then he turned to me and said , " Allah called my mother one year ago . Allahu akbar . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . And I was . For both of us . I pressed at my eyes with my handkerchief , trying to dry them . The very clothes Mother wore into the grave smelled of lavender . This man 's mother would be sharply critical of that , no doubt . She dared not go off to her god scented in this worldly way . I looked at the man next to me . His eyes were glistening in the electric light with his own tears . He loved his mother . She loved him . I wanted to say now that she was all right . She was in heaven . He , too , seemed to be struggling to find words . " Allah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of the woman who never knew Jesus . He looked into my naked face . We both of us remained silent . Finally he said , " I am sorry also . " Our eyes held for only a moment more , as if we were passing in the street , thinking briefly that we recognized something familiar . But no . I was a tourist here . And he was from another world . Then I rose and said , " Goodbye . " " Goodbye , " he said . I followed the path back the way I 'd come , rushing , the air dank , difficult to breathe . What did I know of eternity ? Mother was on her own now . Masud 's mother as well . He would soon prostrate himself at the cry of the muezzin . I would kneel this evening beside my bed in the hotel and pray the Lord 's Prayer . It was not up to me to sort this out . One more turn in the path and then light was ahead . I pressed forward quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the place at last . Outside , among the sycamores , with a faint scent of roses in the air , I stopped . I lifted my face to the light , desperately grateful for the sun , which I knew was even now rising over my garden in Alabama .
