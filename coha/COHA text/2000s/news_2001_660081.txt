<p> Chorima and husband , Sudin , thought they 'd find safety in proximity to a police station . But it was a fatal mistake . When word came that ethnic Dayaks were attacking rival Madurese on Indonesian Borneo , the couple hid in an empty house across from the station . They cowered there for a day until the police came pounding on the door . " They said , ' run for your lives , ' " recalls Chorima , now safe in her father 's home on the island of Madura . " ' Go to the forest . The Dayaks are here . ' " Chorima and Sudin ran to the woods . By nightfall , Dayaks carrying torches were on their trail . One attacker threw a spear at Sudin , pinning him to the ground , before they set upon him with machetes . The next spear whizzed past Chorima , missing . " I just ran because if I did n't , I 'd be next , " she recounts with monotone voice and glazed eyes . As a teen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better life . But this month she became one of 50,000 to 70,000 people who have fled their homes . Her ordeal offers a disturbing portrait of an Indonesia that , despite its aspirations of democracy , often fails to protect its citizens , and rarely holds accountable the perpetrators of gross human rights violations . And Chorima is just one of many struggling to cope with the upheaval of the lastest refugee crisis on this tumultuous archipelago . No one argues against the fact that the police , who only recently were separated from the military , are ill-trained and underpaid . The government says it did its best to quell the crisis concentrated in Central Kalimantan province by sending in troops who evacuated tens of thousands of Madurese . Last weekend , Defense Minister Mohammad Mahfud blamed the sluggish response on the US embargo on arms sales to Indonesia . Mr. Mahfud said they could only fly in two of its Air Force 26 Hercules C-130 transport planes , due to a shortage of parts , The Associated Press reported . The US responded that restrictions on commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sudin died , Chorima fled the forest and went back to her village . There , she and several others clung to the bars of the police station , hoping that the Dayaks would not kill them directly in front of the officers . But Dayaks were n't the only ones she need to fear . The police beat her and tried to make her let go , she says , and yelled out to passing Dayaks that they should come and get her . " The police said , ' Why do n't you pull her away and kill her too , because her husband is dead anyway , ' " Chorima bleats - remote , like a witness reading someone else 's testimony . Chorima says that when police pried her from the station and took her 700,000 rupiah savings ( about $ 70 ) , she fled back to the forest again . Later , some fellow Madurese hiding there were coaxed out by announcements over loudspeakers that they should come back to the police station . They were loaded into trucks , she says , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dayaks slaughtered most of them as they drove away . Chorima is not sure how she survived . Eventually , Indonesian military troops arrived and brought her to the town of Sampit before she was put on a boat back to Madura . At a refugee site where the government officials left them , family members almost did n't recognize Chorima . Eight years older and now a widow , she was filthy and haggard from more than a week in flight . Interviews with several refugees from Borneo tell similar tales of their escape from the mayhem . They describe police who stood idly by and did nothing to stop the resentful Dayaks . Police demanded bribes from fleeing Madurese to gain access to boats to carry them to safety . Those who had no money to offer were encouraged to proffer their cars and motorbikes instead . " The police were extremely cruel in that they would n't even let us take our cars or other belongings , or they made us trade them for food , " says Abdul Haye , a cousin of Chorima 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the refugees arriving here are coming with little more than the clothes on their backs . And , after a new round of killings last week - fueled by Dayaks who say the Madurese monopolize the local economy - another 7,000 are on their way , according to representatives of an ad-hoc aid group . Supplies are running low . Sifbrih De Giouie , a volunteer with the Forum of Madurese Youth for Sampit , says the government has only provided enough rice to last the refugees two weeks . " This shows that the government is not serious about helping these people , " says Mr. De Giouie , punching numbers into his calculator , showing how food supply figures come up short . He and other volunteers congregate outside the municipal building in Sampang : a beautiful , grandiose edifice with towering columns , left from the Dutch colonial period . Inside , they gripe , little if any government occurs . A large magic-marker board tracks the refugees and where they are taking shelter on this already taxed island of some 3 million . Huge portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri - loom large overhead , the tops of their frames tilted off the wall at 45-degree angles toward onlookers below . " It just does n't make sense that the government says it ca n't do anything about the situation , " says De Giouie . Across the water on the main island of Java , in Surabaya , Indonesia 's second-largest city and a bastion of support for Mr. Wahid , others are alarmed that his government is moving masses of Madurese away from the land they 've lived on for generations , handing the Dayaks a victory . Transmigration programs initiated under former President Suharto had brought the Madurese from their crowded island to the Dayaks ' home territory , laying the groundwork for conflict between the two groups . " It is unacceptable that the government supports the refugees ' evacuation and that they keep coming . This shows the government 's basic inability to protect its citizens , " says Harun al-Rasyid , the head of the Madurese Society . " Most of these people are not familiar with Madura and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who like many Indonesians uses only one name , may be exceptional in that the bulk of the refugees have never lived here . Most were born in and around Borneo . Nur Hayoun , another refugee , is three generations removed from life on this island . Mr. Hayoun says he left behind rubber and rattan plantations in Borneo . He wants to return to them when the tensions subside . That , despite the fact that the Dayaks burned down all the houses in his village . " What are we supposed to do here ? " he says . " There 's no land ... , no work , and I do n't even think there will be enough food . " " They could have stopped the disputes early , when it involved a few people , instead of allowing it to get to the situation it is today , " he says . The most distressing part of their escape , he adds , was the way they were dealt with by the police . " They treated us inhumanely and just threw food at us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says sadly . " Those who fought harder got , and those who could n't , did n't get . " With Borneo full of scorched earth and fresh casualties , a return to the fertile farmland Hayoun calls home looks unlikely . But he insists it will be safe . Not because he trusts the police , but because , he says , " there are also good Dayaks . " He got along well with his neighbors , Dayaks who actually hid him and his family from marauders from other areas . " The Dayaks who came to attack came from remote areas , " he says . " It was my Dayak neighbor who hid me and then smuggled me out to safety . I do n't know what made them kill . I just know the ones living near me are good .
