INDIA Ambani RELIANCE GROUP Nearly two years ago , the sons of the legendary founder took control of the textile , petrochemical , finance and telecommunications conglomerate . They 've kept the company growing 2003 Revenues : $16.8 billion <P> The 140-acre Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City on the outskirts of Bombay is a showcase for India 's high-tech sector . There , some 8,000 employees of Reliance Group , the country 's largest private conglomerate , operate call centers , monitor the company 's fiber-optic network and update data services provided to cell-phone subscribers . Many would not associate the gleaming campus with Reliance , which blossomed under legendary founder Dhirubhai Ambani in traditional industries such as textiles and petrochemicals . But Knowledge City is evidence that a new generation of Ambanis is reinventing India 's most powerful business enterprise . <P> After Dhirubhai died in July 2002 , his sons , Mukesh and Anil ( estimated combined net worth : $2.8 billion ) , took control . They have been on an expansion tear ever since , successfully bolstering Reliance 's presence in power generation , oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position as a leading player in India 's fast-growing telecom sector . With revenues of $16.8 billion , Reliance last year accounted for 3.5% of India 's GDP . So confident are Indians in the firm 's future that 1 out of every 4 stock-owning citizens hold Reliance shares . <P> That 's a large cheering section , especially considering the doubts voiced after Dhirubhai 's death . Mukesh , 46 and chairman of the group 's flagship Reliance Industries , and Anil , 44 , its vice chairman , seemed so different from their father , a self-made man famed for his ability to work India 's byzantine bureaucracy to his advantage . Some wondered whether the high-born brothers could even work together . The flashy Anil , who is married to a former film actress , likes designer clothes and jogs every morning , his chauffeur driving slowly behind . Mukesh is sedate and prefers spending time with his children or catching up on technical journals . For now , at least , there is no sign of friction . Mukesh and Anil live under one roof with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reliance employees . <P> The Ambani boys appear to have absorbed their father 's deft political touch too . Reliance triggered a row last year over its ability to enter the cell-phone market via a side door , without having to pay the high fees required of government-sanctioned operators . Despite the controversy , Reliance paid a $116 million penalty  --  which its critics said was a bargain  --  and continued to grab market share . Mukesh says he 's determined to keep Reliance growing . His father demonstrated that Indian companies can be modern , vital and competitive . The sons have picked up the torch . " People will remember you after you are gone not for your money or your power , " Mukesh says , " but because of what you have left behind .
