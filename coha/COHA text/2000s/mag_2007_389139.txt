Q Our backyard is the neighborhood kid magnet  --  sometimes even when ours are n't there ! Are we mean to discourage drop-in visitors ? Nope . Of course , plenty of moms aspire to live in a neighborhood where kids can come and go and run from yard to yard . And some actually have the swing set , pool , or shady climbing tree that draws children to their house , giving them an exclusive peek into their own kids ' world ( and the ability to keep an eye on them ) . But having the most popular house can also be a trial : You 're forced to be the **37;2307;TOOLONG guide for everyone else 's children . And while you ca n't undo whatever mysterious kid vibe your yard gives off , you 're not obligated to run the neighborhood daycare center , either . You have every right to send uninvited guests packing if you 're not up to the challenge . The only catch is that you could come off like a scrooge if you start shooing kids away . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents . Be direct , but take the angle that you 're worried about the children 's safety : " We love that all the kids like to play in our yard  --  but we ca n't make sure they 're all safe . So when your child wants to drop by , please come with her " or some such . Chances are , most moms are too busy for a daily dally at your house  --  and that should cut down on visitors . Hey , she 's cute , too ! Q Everyone coos over my newborn but ignores my 2-year-old . How do I get them to notice my older child ? This used to happen to my Mari whenever I took her and her baby sister out . She could have walked in with an announcer and her own theme song and still no one would have noticed how pretty , smart , polite , and advanced she was . How 'd Mari deal with it ? Truth is , she did n't . At age 3 , most of the time she neither noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so busy was she doing the silly little things that kids do . I realized that it was actually I who was bothered by the lack of attention paid to her . So I started accepting the baby 's compliments for what they were : well wishes for a little one recently brought into the world . In the rare instances when Mari realized someone was ogling her sister and not her , I simply readied myself with a standard quip : " Well , we 're fortunate to add another beautiful baby to the family  --  our older daughter set quite a standard ! " That line usually made my big girl , apparently invisible to the baby-struck stranger , suddenly appear . Minding pee in queues Q Is it rude to ask to cut a rest room line if my child has to go really badly ? No , but do n't be surprised by or mad at the woman who tells you to wait your turn . She 's not required to let your child go in front of her . And your kid 's pee dance notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To avoid the whole awkward conversation , you could try giving " the look . " I find that sometimes , if you can catch a person 's eye as you 're telling your child , " Hold on , baby , hold on , " you can have a complete conversation in one glance . And the line leader will likely motion you to the front . If not , your kid may discover a heretofore hidden ability to hold it in . Here 's hoping ! BOX " This much I know ... I 'd had enough of Nick and me bumping heads over who should be responsible for childcare on days when we both had meetings or appointments . So I bought a calendar , and at the beginning of each month we fill it in together so we see when the other has out side obligations . And if one of us schedules something for a day or time that 's already spoken for on the calendar , the offender is responsible for procuring childcare . Of course , there 's room for negotiation , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ever the bad guy . When a conflict arises we do n't bicker ; we can just say , " Talk to the calendar !
