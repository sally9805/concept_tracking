A cherished way of life is disappearing . Sixth-generation farmer Victore Hanson talles how it happened and spotlights the challenges ahead in the first part of our special series on the American farm . // Family farms are vanishing . The Jeffersonian idea that a man and his family might live on their inherited ground , stay rooted as citizens of their local community , and pass on their land to the next generation may likely disappear in this century . I grew up in California among hundreds of rural families who managed to make a good living by working their own land  --  hauling their plums to market , selling their tomatoes at roadside farm stands , feeding their families vegetables they had canned and meat , eggs , and milk produced from farm animals that grazed outside their kitchen windows . Today less than one percent of the American population earns a so in a world with finite resources and a skyrocketing population ? Surely food should be held ever more precious-and its growers be among the most prosperous of our citizens . Far from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Output per acre continues to rise . Genetic and chemical engineering promise ever more productive species of fruits , vegetables , grains , and animals-not to mention an ever wider panoply of herbicides , pesticides , fungicides , and hormones designed to bring in larger harvests at any and all costs . Millions of newly irrigated acres are coming into production in Asia , Africa , Australia , and South America . Westernized agribusiness the world over is displacing traditional peasant , communal , and family gardens as well as virgin forests and hillsides that have never been plowed . Globalization has created a universal and seasonless food market in which produce flows across national boundaries with increasing rapidity , oblivious to local supplies , tariffs , and sanctions . We have Chilean table grapes in January , strawberries from Mexico in March , and oranges year-round from Israel and South Africa . Georgia farmers now compete with peanut growers in Africa . California growers rival raisin producers in Turkey . And farms in the Midwest 's famed " bread basket " go up against grain corporations in Russia that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ample government subsidies . The result ? Across the board , commodity prices that American farmers receive for their grains , cotton , fresh and dried fruits , vegetables , beef , and milk have sunk to historic lows-and show little sign of rising in the near future . If the number of men and women still left on the farm is any indication , we are in an agricultural depression far worse than the one America experienced in the 1930s . Photograph Photograph Photograph // When prices do not meet the cost of production , two consequences result  --  and both bode ill for the traditional family farm . Crashing prices of wheat , corn , and apples turn many of America 's smaller farmers into quasi farmers : They go to town to teach school , change tires , or wait tables , then return home in the evening to lose some of the money they earned hours earlier simply by trying to keep their farms operating . Persevering with their hearts instead of their heads , they keep their farms in production and their land in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidize cheap food for the rest of us . On the other end of the agricultural spectrum , vertical integration continues unabated . There is little money to be made in growing , but enormous gains to be had in packing , processing , shipping , and distributing food . Farmers might receive $6 a box for their peaches , but those same boxes sell in our grocery stores for 10 times that and more . Wheat and corn lose the farmer money , but wheat flakes and corn puffs are ever more expensive on the supermarket shelf . Commodity brokers and agribusinessmen with vast processing plants and fleets of trucks prosper by bringing food from the farm to the consumer , more than making up for the money they lose raising food by shipping and selling it . Their ample off-farm profits are then plowed back into the countryside as they buy more land from families who fall by the wayside . Tax laws , depreciation , and investment speculation also contribute to consolidation of former family farms . Increasingly the result is monoculture : Bigger and bigger megafarms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five million acres of grain , or 30,000 dairy cows . Trapped in the middle are the beleaguered family farmers . Too busy to work in town and too small and cash poor to branch out and become packers and processors themselves , they work hard solely to grow food and hold on to their land . Men and women who drive a tractor all day long to plow 200 acres of fields have scant time to work elsewhere and no money to invest in building a packing house or cold-storage plant . These small , hardworking farmers are forced to farm more cheaply and efficiently than either part-time farmers or agribusinessmen , but have access to the capital of neither . The government offers less than promised : Most of the $40 billion budgeted for agricultural assistance this year will go to the largest companies . Photograph HELP THE FAMILY FARM What will It take to save the family farm ? Lots of hard work , diversification , creative thinking , and more than a little help from people who care . " I want the family farms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Ellen Straus , the matriarch of the extended family that operates the Straus Creamery , a thriving 600-acre organic dairy farm in Northern California ( see Save Our Countryside , October 2000 ) . " It 's important for all of us that these men and women pass their farms along to their children . " Twenty years ago , Ellen reached out to fellow farmers by organizing the Marin Agricultural Land Trust , an innovative land-protection program that has helped small farms threatened by urban sprawl stay in business . To date , MALT has helped protect 30,000 acres of farmland in Marin County alone . Family farmers who want to develop a concerted plan for the survival of their farms can get help from Small Farms , a USDA-sponsored program ; ( 202 ) 401-4385 . And everyone concerned about the future of the family farm can support local farm families by filling the market basket with regionally grown fruits and vegetables . You can also vote for municipal development plans that restore vitality in city centers and older neighborhoods , not proposals that contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmland conservation , contact American Farmland Trust at ( 202 ) 331-7300 ; www.farmland.org. - Monica Michael Willis // And few politicians have the desire or expertise to explain the complexities of federal farm policy . Many wrongly assume that because we consume the least-expensive food in the world we care little about where it comes from or what it 's costing the farmer . But Americans need-and welcome-honest discussions about the farm crisis and we need people with firsthand experience-lots of them-to teach us how our food is grown , at what costs , and whether it is safe . The land , as the Greeks taught us , " grows " people as well as food , which is why Americans should have concerns that go beyond just the safety , price , and plenitude of the countryside 's produce . Our population is increasingly suburban , divorced from nature , and dependent on the salaries we earn by working for others . Rooted farmers-who live on and tend the same ground for decades-remind us of another , older way of life . When codependent farmers lose a grape crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firsthand that life 's hardships are sometimes without remedy or therapy , that tragedies do n't always yield easy answers or solutions . For a democracy to flourish , it needs a few ground-level skeptics : Their often-cranky voices remind the rest of us that we can not always get our way with nature , policy makers-or one another . The physical beauty that family farms offer is also something increasingly rare in this age of rampant real-estate development and suburban sprawl . Visually and emotionally , Americans crave something beyond shopping malls and the vastness of truly wild places , something in between that is near and beautiful . We miss the farmsteads carefully tended fields , shade-tree-lined drives , ancestral barns , vernacular farmhouses-and the sense of country living they provide . The hour is late , but not too late , to save the family farm , if both farmers and consumers can craft responses to what in their hearts they so rightly fear about the future of their countryside and the very food they eat .

In the second century A.D. , Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end of Roman Republicanism : Wealthy men took over the majority of the undistributed public land and were encouraged by the passage of time to think that they would never be evicted . Moreover , they gained possession of adjacent plots and whatever other little parcels were farmed by poor families , sometimes persuading the person to sell , sometimes taking it by force . Thus they were farming vast acreages instead of small plots .... And thereby certain powerful men became extremely wealthy , and the class of slaves increased throughout the country , but the Italian people decreased in numbers and strength since they were hard-pressed by poverty , taxes , and military service . - The Civil Wars I.1.7 Author Affiliation NEXT MONTH , Victor Hanson tells us how family farmers are adapting to America 's ever-changing agricultural landscape .
