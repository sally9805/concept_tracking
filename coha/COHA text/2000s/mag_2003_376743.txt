Last March , Chenoa Taitt , 29 , and her boyfriend Manuel Goncalves , 28 , took a trip to romantic Florence , Italy . They brought along Matt , a mutual friend and former colleague , and Bob , Taitt 's roommate at the time . They also invited Stephanie , Taitt 's best friend from junior high , and an-other former co-worker , TracyLynn . TracyLynn in turn asked her mother to join , as well as a friend , Charlene , who also brought her mom . Altogether , nine people departed from Illinois , New York and New Jersey to spend eight days at adjacent hotels in Florence . " It was a real mishmash of characters , " Taitt says , " but everything just fell together . It turned out to be one of the best vacations I 've ever had . " <P> For Taitt , trips with friends are a way to combine vacation with camaraderie . " It maintains and even builds our friendships , " she says . " This is a tradition I want to maintain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ; I want to be sure we do n't grow apart . " In fact , adds Taitt , who is now engaged to Goncalves , " I would take them on my honeymoon if I could ! " <P> What might sound like a logistical nightmare and cause for a postvacation vacation is becoming a popular leisure strategy . More Americans are traveling not only with their extended families but also with groups of friends  --  on average , seven people total , according to a recent survey by the marketing firm Yesawich , Pepperdine , Brown &; Russell ( YPB &R).; Fans of pack travel enjoy getting group discounts , but mostly they see it as the ultimate in multitasking : Why not catch up with friends while taking in a museum ? And if you opt to skip the art , chances are there 's a willing shopping companion in the group . According to a Travelocity poll , time with family and friends is the most popular way to spend a vacation : 43% of Americans intend to do so this year , compared with 28% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups of friends are overwhelming , " says YPB &R; managing partner Peter Yesawich . " We had no idea it was this high . " <P> Traveling en masse was once occasioned mainly by such events as reunions or bachelor parties . Now travelers invent their own occasions , whether it 's an all-girls outing , a male-bonding trip or a multifamily jaunt . Singles say they prefer to travel with pals , without the baggage of loneliness and the extra single-supplement charges for traveling alone . But even married couples cite the urge to get away with the gang . " People assume those who travel with friends are single , but that 's not the case anymore , " says Cathy Keefe of the Travel Industry Association of America .
