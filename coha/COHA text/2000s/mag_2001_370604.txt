Lucinda Williams is a righteous singer . The sound of her voice is so overwhelming and so moving that she could sing the phone book and probably give it meaning . But she comes up with extraordinary words for that voice to sing  --  deceptively simple words like back steps or hairdo . How do you use the word hairdo in a song and make it so poignant that it almost breaks your heart ? <P> As a person , Lucinda , who 's now 48 , does n't censor herself . She 's without guile , and she suffers from that sometimes because people do n't know what to make of someone so forthright . They feel as if they want to protect her . But she is a real survivor , and the key to her success as an artist is that she has managed to survive without putting the armor on . <P> Lucinda writes from a very personal standpoint , and that can be difficult .

It goes right to the heart of a kind of desperation that everyone has felt . And her words take you to another place and make you look at loneliness in a way that you never would have looked at it before . <P> Songwriting can be a very frightening thing . For me , the fear is about failing to follow the scent of a lyrical idea , failing to come up with the truth of something that you know is there . You 've caught a glimpse of it in one line , one phrase , or the emotional idea that 's come to you . The fear for me is always , " Am I going to be able to capture that ? Can I build a fence around that horse ? " A Lucinda Williams song always does . <P> Singer-songwriter Emmylou Harris has recorded since 1967 .
