<p> A preview of the 2006 high school football season , which kicks off next Friday <p> 1 . Who are the Fab Five prospects of the Chicago area ? <p> Simeon 's Martez Wilson was n't even on the radar when the 2005 season ended . But since college coaches looked at him on film , the Wolverines defensive end has exploded , becoming the state 's top-rated prospect . He has visits lined up with Illinois , Notre Dame , Ohio State and USC . <p> Rounding out the group are Hubbard running back Robert Hughes , a fixture for the Greyhounds since he was a freshman ; Marian Central 's Iowa-bound lineman Brian Bulaga ; Lemont 's Notre Dame-bound Aaron Nagel , who will play running back but was recruited as a linebacker ; and Bolingbrook running back Dale Martin . <p> 2 .

Who are other area favorites to win state titles ? <p> Lincoln-Way East is favored to repeat in Class 8A . The Griffins likely will be challenged by Barrington , St. Rita and Wheaton Warrenville South , among others . <p> Look for Hubbard , which has had some great playoff runs , to challenge for the Class 6A title . With as many as seven potential Division I prospects , coach Elton Harris ' team could be the first Public League state finalist since Robeson in 1982 . <p> The Suburban Catholic Conference is loaded and figures to have state contenders in Montini ( Class 5A ) and Driscoll ( Class 4A ) , which lost 18 starters but is shooting for an unprecedented sixth consecutive title . <p> 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back appears to be a strength , led by Hughes , Nagel and Martin .

O'Connell , De La Salle ; and Zach Libbe , Schaumburg . <p> 8 . Who are the Fab Five juniors of the area ? <p> Robeson receiver Brandon Green is regarded by many as the best Public League player in the Class of 2008 . " He is a tremendous athlete who will be a big-time recruit next year , " Joliet-based scout Tim O'Halloran of Edgytim.com said . <p> The other four are Mount Carmel linebacker Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back Supo Sanni ; and Lemont offensive lineman Graham Pocic . <p> 9 .

Who are five players you have n't heard of but will ? <p> Tight ends Austin Szafranski of St. Viator and Nick Angeliotti of Wauconda have caught the eye of some recruiters . Barrington lineman Tyler Doering is the 6-5 , 290-pound little brother of Iowa 's Dan Doering , a former Bronco All-American . Driscoll 's Colin Peterman will back up quarterback Phil Pedi , who already has won two state titles . And Bremen will rebuild behind running back-safety Tim Cazley . <p> 16 .

Whatever happened to Yarmo Green ? <p> The former Mather All-City running back is awaiting a decision on an appeal on his 40-year sentence for a " brutal and heinous " beating for which he has served 12 years . Both the injuries that the victim sustained and Green 's post-conviction petition alleging he was denied effective representation under the Sixth Amendment are at issue . It is alleged his first lawyer had a drug addiction and his two subsequent lawyers did nothing to help him . Green is eligible for parole in 2014 , when he will be 37 . <p> 18 . Which conference will be the biggest surprise ? <p> The Central Suburban South , which has been dominated for years by Maine South , will be a four-team race , with the Hawks , New Trier , Glenbrook South and Evanston all having a legitimate shot at winning .
