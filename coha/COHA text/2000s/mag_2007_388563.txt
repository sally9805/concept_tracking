Headnote The cute and the shocking at Meerkat Manor // Tim Clutton-Brock has suddenly said , for reasons not at all clear to me , " Hard-boiled egg . " Perhaps it 's best to ignore this . So , I ask him again in our phone conversation what he would pick as the highlights of his past 13 years of directing a field study of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert . Meerkats , a type of mongoose , cluster in family groups and share the job of raising the top female 's pups . Clutton-Brock and his colleagues have published reports on meerkat behaviors ranging from altruism to infanticide . But it turns out that the first highlight that he wishes to discuss actually is a hard-cooked egg . When Clutton-Brock , a behavioral ecologist at the University of Cambridge in England , was setting up the desert study , most meerkats ran away if people got within 300 meters . He and his colleagues " tried everything , " he says , to find treats that would encourage the animals to tolerate people so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Clutton-Brock . " We tried obvious things that other sensible mongooses eat , like peanuts and peanut butter and minced chicken , various sorts of insectivores ' packaged diets , mealworms , and God knows . They would n't eat it at all . " Because meerkats occasionally eat wild-bird eggs , the researchers offered them chicken eggs . But the animals were n't interested . However , when the meerkats came back to hang around their burrow entrance in the evening after foraging , some egg contents earlier spilled on the ground had been cooked by the day 's heat . Several youngsters sniffed at it , tasted it , and finally ate it . " It had n't occurred to us that they would actually rather like their eggs cooked , " says Clutton-Brock . After that breakthrough , judicious use of hard-boiled egg crumbs enabled the researchers and collaborators from other institutions to collect the most detailed data yet on free-living meerkats . The animals ' subsequent tolerance of people has benefited the world of entertainment as well as science . It has given film crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the works , and the television series Meerkat Manor , already a hit , follows the fortunes of one group of meerkats at Clutton-Brock 's study site . Despite their species , the characters ' adventures with illicit pregnancies , wayward children , and neighborhood rivalries resonate with themes in typical television dramas . Meerkat close-ups show both the charms of a highly cooperative life and the trade-oft 's that it requires . To the scientists , the dramatic behaviors have broad implications for the study of social behavior and evolution . But they also make for some great soap opera . ONE FOR ALL Meerkats ' cooperative side , easy for people to like , is also easy to see . The animals live in groups of 3 to 50 animals , mostly close family members with about equal numbers of males and females . They defend territories of 2 to 10 square kilometers . The animals spend the night together in one of the burrows in their territory . By day , they rove through the scrubby vegetation looking for scorpions , lizards , and other small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one member typically stands guard . Depending on how robust the volunteer is and how fast the group moves , guard duty can last half a minute to half an hour . When the guard leaves to forage or the group moves on , another meerkat takes over the watch . The sentinel clambers up on whatever 's available for the best view , be it a tree snag or the hat of a note-taking scientist . The guard stands on its hind legs as stably as a person does and watches intently , turning its head this way and that , and twitching its nose . Its paws dangle by its side or cross in front of its body , like someone waiting politely , perhaps in white gloves . The sentinel provides " a more advanced antipredator system than everybody looking up now and then , " says behavioral ecologist Andrew Young , also of Cambridge . Marta Mauser , now at the University of Zurich , has investigated the guard 's role by recording the soft little chirps that it makes-on average , 10 every minute . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headdown , searching and eating , than it did in the absence of the calls . Silence made the forager look up more often and eat less . Another social nicety shows up when the group has young pups . Until the kids are old enough to tag along with foragers , one of the older meerkats stays home and babysits . For the first 2 or 3 weeks of pups ' lives , the babysitter spends the day underground with the newborns . When the pups are old enough to clamber out of the burrow , the nanny keeps watch near the burrow mouth . Youngsters tumble over each other in wrestling matches and chases and then nap , often cuddled against the babysitter . Should a youngster stray too far , the nanny picks it up by the scruff of the neck and carries it back to safety . Nannies have to stay alert for attacking birds or other predators and for rival groups of meerkats that occasionally invade and kill pups . " One of the most spectacular things a babysitter will do is defend against a raid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a babysitter sends the pups into the burrow and takes a stand in front of them . Because meerkat tunnels are narrow enough to force raiders to enter one at a time , the babysitter has a chance of holding off even a big party , at least for a while . However , the raiders soon start digging around the main entrance , and " get very excited , " says Young . If they widen the tunnel enough , they can gang up on the babysitter or even reach the pups directly . When they do , " it 's gruesome , " says Young . Yet even excited meerkats need time to excavate . Young says that he has watched a babysitter fight off attackers for more than 2 hours before the rest of the family came home and chased away the intruders . A more mundane , but serious , threat to the caregiver is weight loss , says Young . The other adults do n't bring home anything tor the babysitter to eat . Thanks to the magic of hard-boiled eggs , the researchers coaxed meerkats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . During a 24-hour period that included a daylight shift with the kids , a meerkat typically lost 1.3 percent of its body weight , the team reports . An animal that hunted all day gained 1.9 percent of its body weight during the same period . Although the colony 's most dominant male and female parent 80 percent of the pups , " one of the most striking things is that dominant individuals hardly ever babysit , " says Young . He speculates that the mother does n't baby-sit much because she needs to eat to keep providing milk . She becomes fertile again soon after giving birth , which may explain the dominant male 's behavior . " The last thing he wants to be doing is sitting at the burrow with the pups , when she 's out there fertile and available , " says Young . So , it 's the subordinate adults , with teenage backup now and then , that do most of the child minding . Both females and males babysit , but the females do it more often . As far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . An animal , apparently spontaneously , hangs back at the burrow as the rest of the group sets off . There 's none of the snarling and nipping that meerkats use for coercion . Rarely does the same meerkat volunteer two days in a row , and younger and underweight animals are less likely to babysit than are more-robust animals . Hormones may have something to do with the sitter 's self-selection , says Anne Carlson , based in Missoula , Mont. , who works for the Tropical Biology Association , headquartered in Cambridge , England . She investigated hormones known in several species to vary with care giving to youngsters . For example , scrub jays that are feeding younger siblings tend to have blood higher than normal in prolactin . Carlson and her colleagues found that a male meerkat about to spend the day with the kids has higher blood prolactin concentrations than does a similar male in the same group preparing to go off on a day 's foraging . After a day at the burrow , though , the babysitter 's prolactin concentration has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Behavior . Clutton-Brock considers an evolutionary question : What drives a meerkat to go hungry and risk death in battle for somebody else 's pups ? The standard answer to such a riddle invokes the power of kinship , he says , but the meerkat data are leading him elsewhere . Among meerkats , he says , tighter kinship bonds do n't match up with extra babysitting or other effort on behalf of the group . So , he and his colleagues began thinking about an additional factor : the importance of group size . A small group may not field a full complement of sentinels or babysitters , and rivals may snatch territory , kill pups , or even take over a comfortable burrow . " As group size declines , life goes to hell in a hurry , " Clutton-Brock says . " It 's in everybody 's interest to maintain group size . " DARK SIDE In some ways , meerkats look as if they have " the ultimate family life-one for all and all for one , " says Clutton-Brock . But that tight intimacy leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been studying dominant female meerkats ' tendency to violence during the last month of a pregnancy . The supermoms attack subordinate , mature females in the group-even their own daughters-seemingly without cause . The dominant female often wounds subordinates around the base of the tail . Eventually , supermom harries the subordinate out of the group . However , after the dominant animal gives birth , the exile often returns home . However " bizarre , " to use Young 's word , such behavior might seem at first glance , the researchers have proposed an explanation . If the stress of eviction reduces the chances of a subordinate getting pregnant , aggressive behavior would increase the chances that the dominant meerkat would bear the only pups in the group . In the Aug. 8 , 2006 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the team reported an analysis of observations of banished females . Those meerkats were much less likely to conceive when they encountered a male during exile than they were while living with a group , and they were more prone to abortions than were subordinates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually high in the outcasts , and tests showed that their pituitary glands did produce the surge of hormones needed for ovulation . Young suggests that the work provides some of the strongest evidence yet that dominants can monopolize reproduction by stressing out their underlings . If harassment does n't keep her colony mates from getting pregnant , the top female meerkat can always kill the subordinates pups . Never mind that many of them are her grandchildren . Meerkat infanticide is difficult to study because most of it probably happens underground , says Young . He and Clutton-Brock combed through records that they 'd compiled over years and found only 13 cases of a female meerkat earning one or more pups out of the burrow and killing them . " Often , she eats them , " says Clutton-Brock . In seven of those cases , the dominant female was the killer , but in the other six , the killer was a subordinate . On two startling occasions , a subordinate killed the dominant 's pups , Young and Clutton-Brock reported in the Sept. 22 , 2006 Biology Letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 13 cases , the observers knew that the killer female was pregnant . Another analysis confirmed the violent tendencies of pregnant subordinates . In looking at records of 248 litters , the researchers found that pups faced half the normal chance of surviving their first 4 days if any of the subordinate females was pregnant . In the logic of meerkat survival , pup killing makes sense , the researchers say . When youngsters first venture out on a group-foraging trip , they 're such inept hunters that they depend on handouts from the older meerkats . As the number of pups rises , the older foragers catch and distribute more prey , but not enough to compensate fully for the extra pups . So , more pups result in less food for each . An infanticidal mom improves the odds of her offspring getting a square meal . Although female meerkats have this pup-killing streak , Young notes that , unlike lions , the males do n't kill the offspring of other males . Male meerkats commandeer groups now and then , driving out the resident males and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , they do n't typically attack pups of the previous dads . The new arrivals even take a turn feeding the youngsters during foraging . The researchers note that killing pups does n't trigger fertility in female meerkats as a cub 's death does in lionesses . The evolutionary force of sexual selection bears down more intensely on female meerkats than it does on males , Clutton-Brock and his colleagues argue in the Dec. 21/28 , 2006 Nature . In the fight to reach the top spot in the group , female meerkats look forward to the bigger prize . A supermom can dominate a colony for a decade if she 's fit , tough , and smart , and top females average YJ pups during their tenure . Males tend not to hold the top spot for as long , and they father only 9 pups , on average . Throughout their lives , the females show more aggression than the males do . For example , females start more of the clashes in a group than males do , and females are also more often on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they grow up , females win more of the tussles than males do . Such tough gals may not be everybody 's ideal moms . Yet they 're invaluable to researchers studying the forces that underlie such matters as infanticide . Clutton-Brock says that he watches with interest to see how filmmakers attracted by the animals ' charisma handle such shocks to human sensibilities . Meerkat Manor , he says , has been " prepared to tell the hard side , the down side , the dark side , as well as the cute side and the up side . I salute that . " More projects are in the works that will face the same challenge . " How meerkats are presented , " says Clutton-Brock , " is an interesting test case in whether we are happy to allow animals to be animals .
