America without religion is not America <p> This is always the season of the year for reflection on new beginnings , but the horrible deaths of September 11 have added to this year 's thoughts a special urgency : If terrorists are going to kill us just because we are Americans , we might as well be Americans , and inquire more deeply into what being American means . <p> One thing being American means is believing , more than people from most other nations do , that there should be a close relation between reason and faith . As the sociologist Peter Berger puts it , America is the most religious of the developed nations , despite its elites . America , he says , has a people more religious than any other except maybe the Poles or the Indians , while being publicly led by an elite as irreligious as the Swedes . <p> Some members of the American elite can not tell you where some of their most important beliefs come from , since they are in denial : They reject the basic truth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , the John Birch Society coloring book was said to portray the American eagle without a left wing ; the coloring book used by our elites today also shows the American eagle with only one wing . Reason flaps alone , faith has been clipped away-and , as a result , the bird wo n't fly . <p> Historical evidence shows quite clearly that , for our founders , common sense and humble faith taught complementary lessons about truth and liberty . For them , Jerusalem and Athens-and Cicero 's Rome-spoke in harmony on these issues , and reinforced the same points . Faith itself inspired the founding of universities , the presenting of argument and evidence , and the Jewish and Christian ideal of the man of reason and common sense . Meanwhile , common sense and reason , contemplating the sorry record of human experience ( as do many passages of The Federalist ) , pay homage to the " indispensable " role of religion in preparing the common run of men for self-government . Our founders knew that faith ignites new awakenings and fosters new births @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this nation 's founding , for example , the " Battle Hymn of the Republic " reached back into Jerusalem for one of our nation 's deepest roots , and proclaimed resoundingly : TABLE <p> This was a truth Thomas Jefferson grasped , but could not make effective in his own life : " The God who gave us life , gave us liberty at the same time . " God , that is , made all men free ; slavery is an affront to the dignity with which their Creator endowed them . Foreseeing the bloody price that would be paid for slavery , Jefferson wrote : " I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just . " TABLE <p> The founders of the United States held some truths to be self-evident , and cited often the words of St. John : " The truth shall make you free . " In recent decades , by contrast , many have given up their roots in Jerusalem . They no longer believe in truth , or that it is truth that makes men free . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is what they say they believe ; but the idea itself is absurd , and it is clear that they do not really believe it . They do not accord equal truth-value to the opinions of religious fundamentalists and their own . All such persons abhor and oppose religious fundamentalists , and some of them ( Michael Lind and Andrew Sullivan , for instance ) scathingly equate Jerry Falwell 's views with those of Osama bin Laden . They tout their own moral superiority , and credit secularism with all that is good in Western civilization . <p> Anyone who argues holds implicitly that argument under rules of evidence is a norm for reasonable men . Such a man commits himself to something more than vulgar relativism ; he holds that truth matters , inasmuch as the proposition for which there is superior evidence is more worthy of belief . By this method , Aristotle and Plato showed the Sophists and relativists of their day that they were talking nonsense . RATIONALITY GROUNDED IN THE DIVINE <p> This is why our nation 's second president , John Adams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transcendent Creator who deliberately created all things and " saw that they were good , " did more than any other people to establish the possibility of civilization . No human being may be in possession of the rationality behind all things , but the confidence that there is such a rationality requires each inquirer to listen sharply to evidence that sorts out what is true from what is false . It also requires him to respect the rationality of all other inquirers , who may be in possession of evidence he himself lacks . <p> The belief that there is ultimate truth in all things ( to be approached , step by step , through the examination of evidence ) makes possible rational argument among those who disagree . That possibility , in turn , makes civilization possible . Barbarians , contemptuous of evidence and believing only in power , club one another . Civilized people converse , trying to persuade one another through argument and mutual respect . This is truth 's superiority to power . The very possibility of government by the consent of the governed depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth makes men free . So strongly did Adams believe that homage should accordingly be paid the Hebrews , that he affirmed he would pay such homage even if he were an atheist . But there are also other ways in which truth makes us free . For what Jerusalem added to the vision of truth reached by the Greeks and the Romans is that truth is not solely a quality of propositions , or the result of a weighing of evidence , but also a proper name , a preferred name for the Creator . From His intelligence springs the rationality found in all things . All things ( and all events ) may be understood as " speaking " of Him . <p> This step is no doubt a bridge too far for those who prefer the tidier , smaller world of Athens and Cicero 's Rome . Nonetheless , this nation 's Declaration of Independence speaks of " Nature 's God " also as Creator , Supreme Judge of the rectitude of consciences , and Providence . It should be obvious that no man comes close to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be only a very fragile , limited , and self-consciously inadequate subject . In that respect , no man can claim to possess the Truth but , rather , is held under judgment by it . No one of us sees things in all their wholeness and infinite range , but only in part and rather darkly . We are painfully aware of our own mistakes and changes of mind , as we learn more and inquire more . Knowledge of our own ignorance is not uncom mon among us . <p> In short , while relativists seem to claim all capacity for humility and tolerance for themselves , it seems rather obvious that those in awe of Truth , the splendor of their Creator and undeceivable Judge , also have reason for humility and tolerance . Quite aware of their own errors , they have reason to know that others , especially their adversaries , may see parts of the truth that they do not see . Many institutional advances in politics , economics , and human rights have been accomplished by unbelievers , even by those calling themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that believers are often humbled in this way . ) <p> But what we seek-all of us-is truth , because " the truth shall make you free . " For Jews and Christians , this phrase has meaning on three levels . The first meaning is that fidelity to the Light that infuses all things , the intelligibility that springs from the mind of God , has a practical payoff . Fidelity to the light of evidence in things is the only way to avoid being ensnared by power , money , influence , and other seductions that would turn one 's eyes away from the truth . One might not know in any particular matter what is true , just , or right , but one does wish to avoid being swayed by improper partiality . <p> The second meaning is a set of practical operational maxims : Be of steady and sober judgment . Develop habits that strengthen your ability to perceive keenly , deliberate wisely , and judge in a manner that hits the bull's-eye more often than not . The freedom of action of people without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws the broader conclusion implicit in the first two : that if one is to be ruled by evidence , instead of meandering to no result , then one must deploy all the habits and dispositions necessary for acting with self-mastery , rather than being governed by fickle passions and passing whims . To be free does not mean to blow like a weathervane , but to turn like a rudder-with deliberation and forethought , a goal in mind . <p> My daughters ' cats ( if I may tell a parable to exemplify the point ) seem to roll about freely and frolic as they desire , but they are not free ; they can not do other than follow the law of their own nature . They do not act ( invent a new future , choose a new way of life ) ; rather , they behave , as cats have done for some five thousand years , since one of them posed for the Sphinx . By contrast , our children had to learn to master their own far more complex natures , in which instincts under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had to learn the art of self-government from within a maelstrom of anarchy . Merely behaving was not an option for them ; they had to learn to invent their own selves , within certain genetic and environmental limits , and thus to become agents of their own destiny . To keep their minds open to the Light was their best path toward becoming free men and women . RELIGION THE SOURCE OF LIBERTY <p> A liberating concept of truth is not Jerusalem 's only gift to the future progress of humankind ; another is the imperative to care for the widow and the orphan , that is , for the needy and vulnerable . Richard Rorty calls this imperative " solidarity , " Bertrand Russell calls it " compassion , " and both have had the intellectual honesty to say that they learned the idea not from other philosophers but from Jesus Christ , whom they regard as they regard other wise persons such as Socrates . <p> Jerusalem also laid the groundwork for the end of slavery . The Greeks had regarded slavery as natural , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice ( what the strong always do to the weak ) , but also in the sense that it seemed good and fitting that those with the souls of slaves ought to be slaves . Working gradually , like yeast in dough , the teaching of Judaism and Christianity-about the dignity of each man and woman , made in the image of God , and called by name into friendship with the Almighty-revealed the ancient practice for the abomination it was ( and eventually gave rise to the " Battle Hymn of the Republic " ) . Christians , in particular , often failed this teaching ; but they are to be judged in the light of the teaching , not the teaching in theirs . <p> A deeper legacy of faith is religious freedom itself . When Thomas Jefferson composed the argument for the Virginia Statute of Religious Liberty , he relied on a purely Jewish and Christian starting point : the sacred space between the Creator and His free creature , a space in which no other agency dares to intrude , since therein alone can be exercised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Creator 's offer of friendship . It is , Jefferson remarked , a relation prior to civil society . <p> That there is a Creator , and that He offers human beings His friendship in the recesses of each individual heart ( such that neither father nor mother , brother nor sister can stand in for any one of us ) , and that it is the inalienable responsibility of every person to respond to his Creator in full and perfect liberty-all these are not deliverances of unaided reason . They are not even deliverances of other religions , many of which are quite content with mere external observance ( as in Greece and Rome ) . These ideas express a reasoning whose eyesight is lifted up to a new trajectory by Jewish and Christian faith . The encounter with God in spirit and truth , in the inviolable recesses of the self , is a Jewish and Christian discovery . That is the place where the philosophy of religious li berty was born . <p> Whether the awful events of September 11 occasion a deep and long-lasting infusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take hold of the moment . The first moral obligation is to think clearly : We need to end the long bifurcation of reason and faith in the mental habits of recent generations . In the founding generation , those two wings beat very nearly as one , but in generations both before and after there has been a tendency to exalt either reason at the expense of faith , or the reverse . This is a foolish , unnecessary , and destructive mistake . Practical wisdom and common sense are good checks and balances to faith ; and faith , with its call to awakening from the natural entropy of natural morals , gives reason second chances . <p> Further , we need to recognize that the serious partisans of liberty and truth are few ; and that we need each other 's contributions , faults and all . It was wrong of Jerry Falwell to point the finger at his secular adversaries as if they were responsible for God 's " anger " at the United States , and just as wrong of Michael Lind and Andrew Sullivan ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falwell as if he were a soul mate of bin Laden . <p> It would have been far better if leaders on all sides had looked to their own sins rather than the sins of their adversaries . To be faithful to the demands of liberty and truth , as our forebears understood them and bequeathed them to us , is a heavy enough burden for all of us . <p> The unity of a free society is not properly that of a herd of cattle , nudged this way and that by " opinion leaders . " It is that of independent persons who respect each other 's inalienable consciences , and argue unflinchingly about the important matters on which we disagree . One reason we argue is mutual benefit . There is in such argument a kind of friendship ; of such friendship republics are made . The city named by our forebears Philadelphia , Love of Brothers , was intended to foreshadow something like that . And so , I believe , was the coming of the Word to lowly Bethlehem , over which angels sang-to Him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By Michael Novak <p> <p> Mr. Novack holds the Jewett chair at the American Enterprises Institute .
