Strike up the Bland It was the first rehearsal for our play , and I wished I was at the dentist . Or staked to an anthill with red fire ants crawling up my nose . Or even on the losing end of a parent-teacher conference . Anywhere but the auditorium . Still , there I was-the last one into the building where the entire fourth grade waited . Given the choice , I 'd rather pull the whiskers off a werewolf than perform in a dorky play like Omlet , Prince of Denver . But who had a choice ? The auditorium ( or cafetorium , as the principal calls it ) buzzed like a nest of baby rattlesnakes on Christmas morning . My teacher , Mr. Ratnose , huddled onstage with the other teachers . My fellow students fidgeted on the rows of wooden benches , jabbering amongst themselves . Something was up . I scanned the crowd . My partner and friend , Natalie Attired , had saved me a spot in the second-to-last row . Good ol ' Natalie . With a little luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tardiness . Bending low , I hurried toward my seat . Just a few more steps ... I did n't see the foot in my path , but I sure felt it . Ba-dump ! " Whoa ! " I stumbled and staggered like a Rottweiler on Rollerblades . Ka-flump ! I sprawled in the aisle , flat on my face . The room fell silent with worry . " Haw-haw-haw ! " burst from a hundred throats . Or maybe they were just catching their breath . I got up and brushed myself off , scowling at the guilty foot 's owner-a chubby chipmunk . He smiled back as sweetly as a big brother with a carload of water balloons . And then my bad luck multiplied . Mr. Ratnose stepped to the edge of thestage . " Chet Gecko , " he said , " even though you 're tardy , I 'm giving you an honor that many students dream of . " " You 're letting me out of this dumb play ? " I asked . The kids giggled again . Mr. Ratnose glared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrong , " he huffed . " Our lead actor , Scott Freeh , has disappeared . " My ears perked up . ( As much as two holes in your head can perk . ) A missing persons case ? I trotted up the aisle . " You want me to find him , right ? " " Wrong again , " said my teacher . " I 'd like you to take on Scott 's role . " " Me ? " " You . " " Thanks , but no thanks . I 'm a private eye , not a hambone . " Mr. Ratnose crossed his arms . " Be that as it may . You will play the part , or you will write a fifty-four-page report on French classical theater . " He sure knew how to put the screws to a guy . The only thing I like less than looking foolish onstage is writing fifty-four-page reports ( although math class and lima-bean pie are right up there ) . I sighed . " Okay , I 'll do it . Out of curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkled , and a smile tweaked his ratty lips . " The lead : Omlet , Prince of Denver . You 've got a dramatic duet with a ghost ... " " Swell , " I said . " A swashbuckling sword fight ... " " Not bad . " " And a romantic song with Azalea that ends in a kiss . " " That's-Wait a minute ! A kiss ! ? " Mr. Ratnose nodded . " Yes , you fourth graders should be mature enough to handle that by now . " My stomach churned and tumbled like a dingo in a washing machine . Sweat turned my palms into the Okefenokee Swamp . " Wh-who plays Azalea ? " I choked out . " Why , Shirley , of course . " My mind spun . A lip-lock with Shirley Chameleon , Smooch Monster and Cootie Queen of the Known Universe ? Yikes ! In fact , double yikes . " Well , what are you waiting for ? " asked Mr. Ratnose . " Get up here and rehearse . " Right then , I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before our play opened , or my name is n't Chet " Too Young to Be Smooched " Gecko. 2 Through Thick and Twin Before you lose your lunch , let me reassure you : I did n't have to kiss Shirley that morning . We just read the play . The kids who were n't acting got stage crew duty . They met in a corner with Ms. Bona Petite , the teacher in charge of scenery and stage props . What a happy bunch-knowing they 'd get to play with hammers , saws , and paint . Too bad I could n't join them . Instead , I sat with the cast and listened to Mr. Ratnose blather on about the meaning of the play , and how he 'd improved on Shakespeare 's Hamlet . " You 'll notice , " said Mr. Ratnose , " that not only have I made it a musical , which Shakespeare probably wished he 'd thought of ... " Ms. Petite sniffed and rolled her eyes . " But I 've also given it a happy ending . " Mr. Ratnose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graders in the audience will get nightmares . " Igor Beaver , a championship nerd , raised his paw . " Teacher , will we be wearing tights and doublets , like the actors of Shakespeare 's time ? " Mr. Ratnose 's tail curled happily . I could almost see the brownie points piling onto Igor 's permanent record . " Yes , Igor , " he said . " We 'll use traditional costumes . " Great . Now I 'd have to wear sissy tights while frolicking around the stage like a doofus . Would the torture never stop ? Miraculously , it did . After we read through the play , the recess bell rang , and our teachers dismissed us . I buttonholed Natalie Attired for some sleuthing . Did I mention already that Natalie , my mockingbird pal , is as sharp as a pocketful of pins ( but without the annoying tendency to stick into your fingers ) ? She is . But she does have other irritating habits . " Hey , Chet , " she said , as we watched kids milling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big nostrils ? " " Why ? " " Because they have such big fingers ! " She cackled . See what I mean ? I took Natalie by the shoulders . " Birdie , this is no time for jokes . We 've got to find Scott Freeh , and pronto-so he can take back his stupid role . " " You do n't want to play Omlet ? " she asked . " It 's such a great part . " " I do n't care . " I fumed . " I 'd rather gargle with a skunk 's bathwater than kiss Shirley Chameleon . Are you gon na help me or what ? " She held up her wings . " All right , do n't get grouchy . I 'll help . " " Great . First we need to know what Scott looks like . " " Easy-peasy , " she said . " He looks just like that . " She pointed to a skinny anole lizard beside Ms. Petite . " Huh ? " " That 's Scott 's twin , Bjorn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let 's start with him . " As we approached , Bjorn Freeh was just finishing up with Ms. Petite , a ground squirrel who put the ooh in ooh-la-la . Every school has a teacher like this . All the boys love her , and all the girls want to be like her . Ms. Bona Petite had lustrous eyes deep enough to backstroke in , a face cuter than a box of bunnies , and a way of making you believe you were the only one in the world that mattered . Not that I fell for any of that . She touched Bjorn 's arm . " Be strong , " she said . Then she patted her jaunty cap and wafted off like expensive perfume on a summer breeze . " You Bjorn ? " I asked the anole . He tore his gaze away from the ground squirrel and blinked at us . " Uh ? " " I 'll take that as a yes . " Natalie chimed in . " What were you two discussing ? " " Oh , um , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " That 's our favorite subject , too . " I sized up Bjorn . He had a tail as long as a third grader 's Christmas list , and a head as flat as a frying pan . Mmm , frying pan ... termite crisps ... My eyes glazed over with visions of lunch . " So ? " said Bjorn . Regretfully , I reined in my appetite . " We need to find your brother , " I said . " ASAP , " said Natalie . " Before he " - she pointed at me- " has to play Omlet . " " But it 's such a great part , " said Bjorn . " Never mind the part , " I said . " Where the heck is your brother ? " " He 's gone , " said the anole . " That 's what disappeared means . " I clenched my teeth . " Thanks for the vocabulary lesson . But where did he go ? Why ? For how long ? " Bjorn started out the cafeteria door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like bees at a honey hoedown . " Well ... he did n't come home yesterday , " said Bjorn . " But it 's no big deal . " " No big deal ? " I said . " Are n't your parents flipping out ? " The lizard idly fiddled with his tail . " Nah . Scott comes and goes all the time . " I sidestepped a pair of toads playing leapfrog . You get that a lot from toads . " But I thought twins were supposed to be inseparable , " said Natalie . Bjorn shrugged . " Sure , " he said . " We 're as inseparable as oil and water . " " Could some enemy have kidnapped him ? " I asked . " No way , " said Bjorn . " Everybody likes Scott . " " Did he get stage fright and vamoose ? " asked Natalie . The anole chuckled . " Yeah , right . " " What do you mean ? " I said . Bjorn contemplated a nearby gnat . But before he could move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up . You snooze , you lose . The lizard shot me a glance . " Look , my bro 's got ice in his veins . That 's why he 's such a hot soccer player . He 's got stage fright like you 've got an eating problem . " " But I do n't have any problems eating , " I said . " Exactly . " " What ? " " Skip it , " said Bjorn . I sucked in my gut and mulled over his words . We had reached the rusty tangle of pipes and slides that passes for playground equipment at Emerson Hicky . Bjorn gazed at the jungle gym . " Can you think of anything to help us find your brother ? " I asked . The anole squinched up his face . " Um ... nope , " he said . " But he 'll show up . " And with that , he trotted off to play . " Hmm , " I said . " You took the hum right out of my mouth , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as funny ? " " Yeah , " she said . " Pies in the kisser , knock-knock jokes , and that face you make when you eat broccoli by mistake . " I looked at her . " Besides all that . " " Well , Bjorn did n't seem too worried about Scott 's disappearance . " " He did n't , did he ? " Natalie cocked her head . " So , what does that mean ? " " Partner , " I said , " the plot has officially thickened . " She grinned . " Great ! Add some potato bugs and we 've got a stew . "
