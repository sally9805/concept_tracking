The Earl of Blackhearth , Nathan Manning , had once considered the heat of a summer 's day in India to be stifling . But now , after waiting in the parlor of his great aunt 's London home for almost half an hour , surrounded by his mother and two younger sisters , he truly understood what it meant to be stifled . At this point , he would prefer July in India on the back of an unwashed elephant . Anything but this . <p> And yet he had no choice but to be back in England . <p> " Nathan , your aunt has been tittering all week about your visit , " his mother said with a conspiratorial smile at his sisters , Adelaide and Lydia . <p> Nathan arched a brow and gave his mother a look that could not be misinterpreted . His aunt , Lady Worthington , was not a woman prone to " tittering " over anyone . And Nathan had clear memories of her once berating him quite savagely when he was a child . He had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seemed he was remembered as everyone 's favorite . Which was why he had been paraded around all week , giggled over , pinched , and basically treated like a piece of meat  --  rich meat that would soon set out to find a wife . <p> Before Nathan could answer his mother or she could react to his look , the door to the parlor opened and his aunt stepped inside . Nathan got to his feet to greet her . Just as he recalled , she was a tall , thin , stern woman with little light or joy in her expression . <p> Still , she spared the group with a small , tight smile before she said , " Do forgive me for making you wait . I was just finishing up with my seamstress . I shall return momentarily . " <p> Nathan suppressed a yawn and turned away from the door to pace the small parlor . Outside , he heard his aunt speaking to someone , her strong voice coming in clear into the parlor . <p> " Thank you so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look forward to seeing the gown . " <p> Nathan stopped pacing and lifted his head . Miss Willows ? No , it could n't be . It was n't . There was no way it could be . . . <p> " You are more than welcome , Lady Worthington . I shall be certain your dress is ready long before the ball . " <p> Nathan spun around , the voice of the other woman piercing into his body , penetrating his very soul . He found himself moving toward the door , almost against his will . When he reached the barrier , he stopped , peering into the foyer that was just a few feet away . <p> And there she was  --  Cassandra Willows . Just as he remembered her from four years earlier . Except more beautiful , if that was even humanly possible . <p> Her dark auburn hair was bound against the nape of her neck and little strands fell around her face . The face that had lost some of its innocent roundness , the fullness to her cheeks . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freckles he had fallen in love with were long gone . <p> And her dress . No longer did she look like the daughter of a middle-class merchant . Her clothing was the height of fashion , fitted perfectly to her full breasts , then sweeping down dramatically over her form . <p> Nathan opened his mouth , but found he had been rendered speechless as he stood staring at a woman he had not seen in four years  --  a woman whose voice he 'd last heard telling him she loved him . . . right before she did not show up for their planned meeting . Right before she reneged on her agreement to run away to Gretna Green and threw him over for another man . <p> In that moment , there were so many emotions bombarding Nathan that he could scarce name or place them all . But two exploded to the forefront , making themselves known in powerful , almost equal measure . <p> The first was lust , a need that heated his blood to a surprising level and made his hands shake with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those luscious breasts . He was startled by a powerful drive to feel this woman writhe beneath him in ultimate pleasure as he claimed her again and again . <p> The second was anger . Anger he had tried to tamp down and deny during his years away in India . It was a strong emotion he thought he 'd mastered until this moment , when it washed over him in a wave that threatened to drown him . This woman had lied to him , betrayed him , and played him for a fool . <p> And for some reason , he still gave a damn about that fact , even after all this time . <p> " That sounds perfect , Miss Willows , I shall see you then , " his aunt said with a smile that was far warmer than those she gifted to most people . <p> Cassandra opened her mouth to reply , but then stopped . She turned slightly , almost as if she sensed his stare burning through her clothing . Her gaze slipped to Nathan , standing in the doorway like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like an eternity , though in reality it was little more than a few seconds . All the blood left Cassandra 's already pale cheeks , she swallowed hard and blinked a few times . <p> But then all the reaction was wiped clean from her expression . She returned her attention to Nathan 's aunt . " Good afternoon , Lady Worthington . " <p> Without so much as a second glance in his direction or a word of acknowledgment for his presence , Cassandra turned away and departed the house . Nathan could do nothing but stare at her retreating back until his aunt 's servant shut the door behind her . <p> " Great God , Nathan , you look as though you 've seen a ghost . Have I changed so much during your years in that savage country ? " his aunt snapped , as she grasped his arm and almost dragged him back into her parlor . " O-Of course not , Aunt Bethany , " he stammered , finding his voice with much difficulty . " I was simply admiring your fine home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
