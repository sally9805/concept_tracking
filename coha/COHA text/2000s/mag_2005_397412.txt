After a dirty-bomb attack , special formulations could counter radioactive contamination <p> It 's a lot easier to make a mess than to clean one up . This fact of life has lately become fraught with dire possibilities . Suppose the mess is radioactive ? Suppose it was created by terrorists wielding a dirty bomb , an explosive laced with a radioactive substance such as uranium or cesium ? What then ? Reach for a bottle of Radiation-Be-Gone ? <p> Unfortunately , such a cleaning products does n't exist . In the past few years , however , several U.S. government agencies have quietly focused a small research effort on developing new technologies for countering the radioactive fallout from what 's officially known as a radiological dispersal device , or RDD . Although the bomb 's conventional explosive would damage the immediate area , radioactive material would contaminate more broadly . As people fled , the radiation-tainted area could become a ghost town . <p> " If no one wants to go back to work in downtown Manhattan , then we 're in trouble , " says James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research Center at New Mexico State University . <p> Decontamination techniques currently available , such as sandblasting and demolition , are unthinkable for many prime targets , such as downtown Manhattan or the National Mall , says Todd S. Brethauer of the Arlington , Va. - based Technical Support Working Group ( TSWG ) . This **25;4955;TOOLONG branch of the U.S. government is funding some of the anti-dirty bomb work . <p> The time required for traditional methods of decontamination and their costs would be staggering . What 's more , it might be impossible to restore historic structures or revered monuments to preattack conditions . <p> That 's where some sophisticated chemical engineering may come to the rescue . " We 're in better shape than we 've ever been , " says nuclear engineer Michael D. Kaminski of the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago . <p> An assortment of prototype radiation-binding and - ridding gels , foams , films , and emulsions is now emerging from government , university , and industrial labs . The purpose of those materials is to restore a contaminated zone with unprecedented speed , economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new approaches came from baby diapers . <p> Researchers hesitate to share precise data about how well their substances work , citing their obligation to protect government or commercial secrets . " We do n't want to expose a vulnerability , " explains biologist Thomas P. McCreery of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) in Arlington , Va . <p> The scientists nevertheless claim that fast , complete recovery from a dirty-bomb attack increasingly looks feasible . " If we 're effective " after an attack , McCreery says , " people can just go back in there as if it never happened . " <p> COVER UP In a typical dirty-bomb scenario , a car bomb explodes on Wall Street in New York City , on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington , D.C. , or in some other high-profile neighborhood . The bomb contains a coffee can-size dose of cesium chloride powder . The blast kills scores of people , injures many more , and spews highly radioactive particles across some 10 city blocks . <p> Response teams would need to quickly clean up a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The surface area in 10 city blocks in downtown Manhattan is a billion square feet , " Conca estimates . Factoring in human psychology , responders would probably have to achieve radiation levels close to the pre-attack levels . <p> Ironically , firefighters and other emergency personnel would probably first respond to a dirty-bomb attack by gluing the radioactive material to the contaminated surfaces . During a simulated dirty-bomb attack staged in Seattle in the spring of 2003 , " one of the lessons learned was that responders had nothing to stop the spread of radioactive dust , " Brethauer says . <p> " The first step has to be to prevent further migration " of the bomb 's fallout , agrees chemical engineer Robert C. Moore of Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque . Immobilizing radioactive material may also enable rescue workers to do their job without becoming contaminated . <p> To meet those needs , researchers have been devising sticky coatings that can be sprayed from trucks and robotic sprayers or applied as paint is . The coatings have to adhere even in foul weather , maintain their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , ultimately , be easy to remove . <p> Fixatives developed in the past were designed for use only on a small scale and in controlled environments , such as inside the containment building for a nuclear-power reactor , notes physicist Christina A. Lomasney , who heads the Seattle-based company Isotron Advanced Polymer Composites . <p> At the request of TSWG , Isotron has just developed a polymer coating that might be valuable after a dirty-bomb attack . Tests earlier this year confirmed that firefighters using standard equipment could add the material to water rushing through their hoses , just as they now add foaming agents to more effectively smother fires . <p> The sprayed-on polymer would dry within a few hours into a film that turns blue as it cures for easy recognition and that is tough enough to withstand truck traffic . The film remains tacky even when dry , so it continues to trap contaminants , Brethauer says . <p> So far , TSWG has spent a modest $350,000 on developing the coating . In a modified form , it can fix in place nonradioactive dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopter landings and takeoffs . " We 're trying to get some of the materials out to U.S. military forces in Iraq and see if they can help , " Lomasney says . <p> Taking a different tack , researchers in a year-old program sponsored by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been investigating fixatives made from water-based emulsions containing asphalt or wood resins . Emulsions of similar materials are already widely used for repairing cracks in asphalt pavements and roofs . <p> Tests on coatings less than a millimeter thick were reported in the May 15 Environmental Science &; Technology . These and other recent laboratory experiments examining the films ' toughness , impermeability to water , and chemical and physical changes in response to radiation have produced encouraging results , says study coauthor Victor F. Medina , an environmental engineer at the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center in Vicksburg , Miss . <p> Medina estimates that the emulsions will cost as little as a hundredth the price of competing fixatives . " There 's almost no question that their low cost is going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the immediate stabilization response to a dirty bomb , the cleanup must begin in earnest . Removing the fixative coatings-many of which are designed to peel off in large , easily disposable pieces-will clean away radioactive particles that had adhered . Yet the physical properties of many building materials  --  and of the radioactive isotopes , or radionuclides , that would land on them  --  complicate the task of thoroughly removing the contamination . <p> Cesium-137 , strontium-90 , cobalt-60 , and other potential bomb ingredients are reactive metals . " They do n't just sit on the surface-they bond to it , " McCreery explains . <p> If the conditions are damp or wet , a water-soluble compound , such as cesium chloride , can seep several centimeters into concrete , brick , marble , and other porous building materials . Within hours to days after the attack , the radionuclide could be inside walls , where it would be much harder to clean up . <p> Cesium is " our lead candidate as a threat , " McCreery says . It emits gamma rays-the most penetrating radiation-and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical treatments and food sterilization . <p> Argonne 's Kaminski got a bright idea about cleaning up messes 3 years ago , when his son Mikey was only a few months old . " I knew how well diapers worked for my son . I was wondering if there was a way I could make something like that that would draw the radioactivity out , " Kaminski recalls . <p> Disposable diapers contain a crystalline powder in which each grain contains strandlike polymer molecules chemically bound into a loose-knit mesh . When a water-based liquid , such as urine , enters the mesh , it expands and forms a thick goop . Such absorbents can soak up hundreds of times their weight in liquid . <p> But recovering radionuclides requires a lot more than just soaking up water . In one version of a cleanup strategy developed by Kaminski and his colleagues , crews would first hose surfaces with compounds , called extractants , designed to detach radioactive atoms that had bound to iron oxides , clays , or other ingredients within porous building materials . <p> Next , the crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of polymers also used in disposable diapers . The gel contains nanoscale particles designed to sop up the radioactive atoms released by the extractants . The nanoparticles " actually grab on to the atoms and surround them completely . They 're very aggressive , " Kaminski says . <p> Because the dissolved atoms entering the damp gel become sequestered in the nanoparticles , the radionuclide concentration in the gel 's water component remains minimal , and radioactive atoms continue to diffuse from the pores into the gel . To sop up the last of the radionuclides , the scientists trigger an expansion of the gel that draws water from the pores . <p> On some concrete surfaces , the gel absorbs more than 98 percent of radioactive atoms in about a half hour , Kaminski reports . Other surfaces require several treatments . After each treatment , he adds , a cleanup crew in protective suits would wet vacuum the tainted gel and remove it for disposal . <p> TSWG has spent close to $1 million so far on the Argonne gel . By the end of this year , Kaminski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a company that will commercialize the material . <p> In a program under DARPA and the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , teams at Sandia labs and at Los Alamos ( N.M. ) National Laboratory are also developing cleanup gels . <p> A TAILORED RESPONSE Decontamination success may hinge on the appropriateness of a cleaning agent to the particular dirt spewed by a bomb , Kaminski says . At Los Alamos , scientists are developing new forms of chemical additives , called chelators , that bind to radioactive contaminants more strongly and selectively than do those already in use . " We want chelators that are specific for our radioactive metals of interest " but that do n't bind to others , such as calcium , which is a major ingredient of concrete and marble , says Mark E. Smith , a polymer scientist at the lab . <p> Using one of the conventional , nonspecific chelators to respond to a dirty-bomb attack in an urban setting would be like throwing away the expensive compound , Smith says . <p> To create new chelators , the Los Alamos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amino acids , that can bind with high specificity to particular metals . Compared with conventional chelators , peptides are more effective in the chemical environment of damp concrete or rock , and they 're inexpensive , says Los Alamos chemist Edel M. Minogue . <p> To choose among tens of thousands of peptide candidates , which differ in their sequences of amino acid building blocks , Minogue and her colleagues have developed a high-throughput screening technique . They start with an array of thousands of styrene beads , each hosting just one of the candidates . Then , the researchers immerse the array in a solution rich in ordinary metals-such as iron , aluminum , and calcium-but also cobalt . Under X-ray illumination , any bead with a peptide that strongly binds one or more of the dissolved metals emits secondary X rays that indicate which metals the bead had grabbed . Its location in the array identifies the successful peptide . Minogue and her colleagues described the method in April at an optical-engineering conference in Dublin , Ireland . <p> After using the technique , says Minogue , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a gel . <p> Other teams in the DARPA/DHS program at Isotron and at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls have also created novel decontamination agents . <p> Researchers ' opinions differ over the potential roles for high-tech decontamination agents . Conca says that stockpiling the materials in sufficient quantities will be neither practical nor affordable , so he 's not counting on them to play the leading role in the response to a dirty bomb . <p> " The only way to clean up is to just deluge the place with water " and then let the runoff enter a nearby body of water , where the radiation will become diluted , he says . <p> However , Conca sees a role for the new cleaners on surfaces that do n't respond to the deluge method . He advocates storing substantial quantities of the materials , say , in a couple of railroad tanker cars , near every major city or other potential dirty-bomb target . <p> WATCHFUL FOES Countermeasures to the dirty-bomb threat naturally go beyond finding better ways to clean up after the fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrorism value of some radiation sources , such as the cesium powder in medical devices . Meanwhile , regulators are tightening controls on radioactive sources and creating more-detailed databases to keep tabs on the materials . <p> Ultimately , however , there may be no measure more crucial to preventing dirty-bomb attacks than cleaning up quickly after the very first one . Should an attack take place , says Conca , its perpetrators will probably be monitoring the speed and efficacy of the cleanup to decide the value of launching another attack . <p> " The number of dirty bombs we face , " he predicts , " will be determined by how we deal with the first .
