<p> An art collector becomes an art collector , goes the old saying , when he brings home a new piece and has no place left to hang it . <p> The Bay Area has plenty of collectors who 've run out of space  --  millionaires with Warhols and Rauschenbergs as well as art lovers of lesser means who collect everything from 18th century Indian miniatures to Mexican folk art and new paintings by young local artists . <p> " More and more , the Bay Area is internationally recognized as a strong art-collecting community , mostly in the contemporary field , " says Steve Nash , chief curator at San Francisco 's Fine Arts Museums . <p> With the economy flush and local galleries and museums drawing larger crowds , more and more people are beginning to acquire art , including those who 've made their first purchase over the Internet . <p> " We 're in one of the healthiest periods anyone can remember for collecting and selling art , " says Jeffrey Fraenkel , whose noted Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco sells photographs . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the installment plan and big-time collectors who drop $500,000 for a Man Ray . <p> One does n't need a fortune to collect art . But it helps when acquiring the kind of modern and contemporary art owned by the eight Bay Area collectors who made ARTnews ' Top 200 Collectors list last year . <p> They include such prominent San Franciscans as Gap founders Don and Doris Fischer ; Levi Strauss heir Peter Haas and his wife , Mimi ; discount brokerage king Charles Schwab and his wife , Helen ; venture capitalist Richard Kramlich and his wife , Pamela ; psychologist Norman Stone and his wife , Norah ; and retired investment banker Kent Logan and his wife , Vicki . <p> One member of each couple sits on the board of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , which they 've supported financially and with gifts and loans from their collections . <p> The Logans have a huge collection  --  about 750 contemporary works by 200 artists , among them Diebenkorn , Rauschenberg , Anselm Kiefer and Cindy Sherman . Kent Logan refers to works in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figural elements " to make statements about contemporary society . " Collecting , he says , " is a disease , a passion . It 's a disease I ca n't live without . " <p> The Stones have about 150 works in their contemporary collection , including numerous pieces by the fabled French iconoclast Marcel Duchamp and by three of his conceptual heirs  --  pop icon Andy Warhol , multimedia artist Bruce Nauman and German sculptor Joseph Beuys . <p> Duchamp 's erotic pot holders  --  a cloth penis dangling from one plaid pad , a dark triangle stitched to the other  --  hang in a Plexiglas case in the living room of the Stones ' San Francisco mansion . One of his famous mustachioed Mona Lisa prints is in the breakfast nook . There 's a set of Warhol skull paintings on the living room wall and a fright-filled self-portrait of the artist in the downstairs gallery , where a T-shaped Richard Serra steel sculpture is propped precariously against the wall . <p> In the upstairs entrance hall stands a mysterious Beuys vitrine containing , among other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter fat ( fat is a common element in the work of Beuys , whose burned body was slathered in the stuff by villagers to keep him alive after his Luftwaffe plane crashed in the Crimea during World War II ) . <p> " If you opened that you 'd be overwhelmed , " Norah Stone says with a laugh . " It smells terrible . " <p> The collection " has a strong conceptual element to it , " says Norman , 60 , whose father owned a big Chicago insurance business . Tutored by SFMOMA curator John Caldwell , who died in 1993 , the Stones developed a taste for edgy art of the ' 80s and ' 90s . " We never intended to collect pretty pictures , " says Norah , a onetime lawyer who does n't give her age . " We 've never shied away from collecting difficult pieces . I not only like to be challenged , I like to challenge other people . " <p> The Stones plan to give their collection to SFMOMA , and bought the work with that in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be available to the museum unless some people like us bought things that would end up going to public institutions , " says Norman , who declines to discuss their monetary value . " This is not for sale . It 's not an investment . " <p> The Kramlichs feel the same way about their groundbreaking collection of video and installation art . They own several hundred works by such noted artists as Nam June Paik , Bill Viola , Nauman and Matthew Barney . <p> Caldwell suggested they could make a contribution by focusing on media-based art , which had n't been assembled in a serious way . " What we think we can do here is make a difference , " says Dick Kramlich , a 64-year-old high-tech venture capitalist who credits his wife with shaping the collection . New York art adviser Thea Westreich has helped guide them . <p> " We have a great appreciation for this whole medium , the things you can do with films and videos . You can get over cultural and social messages that you ca n't do in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if somebody opens a vault and finds this material , they 'll get a snapshot of what part of our present-day civilization was like . " <p> The Kramlichs are building a home in Napa to house the collection , which will be open to small museum tours . Now works are installed throughout their San Francisco home . Dara Birnbaum 's " Tiananmen Square : Break-In Transmission , " which looks at the role of the media in the 1988 Chinese student uprising , is a series of video monitors and speakers strung on a web of black steel poles that hangs in the stairwell . <p> Barney 's " Cremaster 2 , " a hallucinatory film about executed Utah killer Gary Gilmore ( with Norman Mailer appearing as Houdini ) , plays on a screen in the Kramlichs ' bedroom . They flip it on whenever the mood strikes or to show it to friends and visitors . <p> " It 's the most incredible , thought-provoking piece , " Richard Kramlich says of " Cremaster 2 , " which goes on display May 20 at SFMOMA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum . <p> Not all the major Bay Area collectors made the ARTnews list . Missing were Harry W. and Mary Margaret Andersen , whose collection of modern art will be shown at SFMOMA this fall ( their graphic art will be shown at the Palace of the Legion of Honor ) . There are also up-and-coming collectors such as physician Allan Rappaport , who has a small but beautiful collection of Rodin sculptures that includes casts of " The Thinker " and " The Age of Bronze . " <p> Down the Peninsula , Elvira and Gursharan Sidhu have a major collection of exquisite 17th and 18th century Indian paintings , as well as ancient Mexican terra-cotta figures , contemporary Mexican folk art and prints , a Zulu spoon and other things that speak to them . <p> Visitors to their simple suburban home are greeted by a big ninth century Javanese stone sculpture of Ganesha , the Hindu elephant god who removes obstacles . The mantel is lined with mysterious 3,000-year-old figures from Mexico and Guatemala . <p> On the wall is a rare and beautiful painting on wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's venerated by other gods . Gursharan believes the work , a manuscript cover , was painted around 1700 by Pandit Seu , the progenitor of a large family of great Indian artists . The Sidhus , who often lend their work for exhibitions , gave a similar piece to San Francisco 's Asian Art Museum . <p> " This is not about building a collection , it 's what we want to live with , " says Gursharan , a former Apple engineer  --  he helped create the technology that led to desktop publishing  --  who last year co-founded a high-tech firm called ipVerse . " If you do it intensely , and you respond to things and make quick decisions , you end up having a lot of stuff . " <p> The Sidhus , who met at Stanford years ago  --  he came from New Delhi , she from Mexico City  --  do n't know how many works they have , and they do n't want to know . It 's probably more than 1,000 . <p> " The numbers do n't matter , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want an example of every type . Each piece has to have a quality that you enjoy . Elvira and I do n't verbalize it ; we just look and react . " <p> Adds Elvira , who works in marketing at Hewlett-Packard : " The moment you start looking for reasons , you start analyzing , it distracts from the overall feeling . We just say , I think that 's wonderful . ' " <p> The Sidhus still delight in works they 've seen hundreds of times . One is a Nepalese erotic painting , circa 1400 , whose intricate patterns and bold colors " Matisse would have loved , " Gursharan says . <p> Like the Sidhus , Dan Dodt collects many kinds of art . His huge Victorian house in a working-class San Francisco neighborhood is filled with Victorian paintings and 18th century Japanese woodblock prints , New Orleans folk sculpture and potent paintings by contemporary Bay Area artists such as Travis Sommerville . A music-making sculpture by legendary avant-garde composer John Cage shares space in a room with a 1783 Mexican painting of Our Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Wolf of Gubbio by New Orleans artist Pat Katschalk that suggests a mix of Giotto and Roy De Forest . <p> An electrical systems and lighting consultant , Dodt , 45 , has a 200-work collection that " is continually out of focus , " he says with a laugh , " and that 's how I want to keep it . I 'm not looking to build a collection that 's thematic in any way . I acquire a piece because of a spontaneous reaction I 've had to it . I call it arrested perception . The piece may attract or repel me , but it causes me to return to it . " <p> Dodt estimates the works in his collection  --  which he buys at auction from the artist or from dealers such as Catharine Clark  --  average around $500 each . Collecting art , he says , " is not an exclusive or elitist activity . It can be done by anyone who 's interested in images and figures and the way artists transmit their understanding of their lives and reaction to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tim Jones had never bought a piece of art until last summer , when he came across nextmonet.com , the San Francisco-based online art gallery that offers nearly 10,000 works by 700 artists . He fell in love with an etching of Jackson Pollock by Robert Arneson , bought it for $1,250 and has since purchased four more pieces the same way . <p> " I 'm blowing my budget , " says Jones , 40 , an executive headhunter who feels more comfortable perusing art at the virtual gallery  --  where he can group images any way he wants and read about the artists  --  than walking into an actual one . " I can look at what I want , when I want , at my own pace , " Jones says . <p> Nobody knows how big the offline art market is  --  private art sales are n't tracked in what 's estimated to be a multibillion-dollar business . But the fledgling online market is growing , with dozens of virtual galleries and auction sites crowding onto the Internet . They range from artnet.com , onview.com and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nextmonet.com , founded by high-tech marketing specialist Myrna Nickelsen and former Apple executive Michael Muller , sells a wide range of work by emerging artists and famous ones such as Wayne Thiebaud and Sol Lewitt . Most of the pieces , juried by a panel of artists and experts , come from 120 galleries in the United States and Europe , who split their commissions with nextmonet.com . <p> " People are buying online because of the convenience , and because we make them comfortable buying art , " says Nickelsen , whose business has grown almost tenfold since the site went up last summer and expects to gross $10 million this year . She estimates 70 percent of her customers have never bought art before . <p> But a lot of people would n't think of buying art without seeing it live , feeling its presence and texture and other qualities that are lost on a flat screen . Nextmo net.com buyers have five days to return the art , at no cost , before the sale is final . Only about 10 percent of the work sold has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leap of faith , " says Jones . But when he sees the actual art , " it 's always as good or better . "  --  Jesse Hamlin <p> MOST DOT-COM MILLIONAIRES MAY BE TOO BUSY FOR ART <p> The papers are full of stories about the raft of new Silicon Valley millionaires , and young dot-com workers with pockets full of cash . Are they buying art ? <p> Not much , say dealers and other art-world players . " We have a few clients in Silicon Valley who are collectors , " San Francisco art consultant Mary Zlott says . " So many people have made so much money , but in general , most of them have not put their money into art . My guess is these people have been working very hard and have n't had the time . It 's an audience waiting to happen . " <p> San Francisco dealer Kim Eagles-Smith has a client who sold his software company and now collects California Impressionist and modern paintings . But Eagles-Smith does n't see many other tech types buying art , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cultivate a passion and an interest in art , and they have n't arrived there yet . " <p> Michael Harkin has . For the past decade , the 48-year-old Hewlett-Packard engineer has been collecting lithographs by Picasso , Rauschenberg and others . <p> " It enriches my life , " says Harkin , who lives in Cupertino . " Collecting has n't caught on down here . People have been trained as engineers and in high-tech fields , and when they get a job , that 's pretty much all they focus on . " <p> Catharine Clark does n't buy that . Her San Francisco gallery has a batch of new clients who work in technology , some in their 20s . " We 're seeing more and more people who are making money in Internet and related computer businesses buying art , " says Clark , whose gallery focuses on young emerging artists . Of the 20 or so clients she 's gotten through the virtual gallery nextmonet.com , about half work in the wired world . <p> San Jose gallery owner Fred Spratt has been selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the young dot-com crowd " has n't yet found me , and I have n't found them . " Robert Fishko of New York 's Forum Gallery was happy that young Internet millionaire Paul Graham found him . <p> Graham , who sold his Viaweb software company to Yahoo in 1998 for $49 million , liked a nude painting by Richard Maury he saw last fall in Fishko 's booth at the San Francisco International Art Exposition . He bought it on the spot for $65,000 . <p>  --  Jesse Hamlin <p> E-mail Jesse Hamlin at jesse@sfgate.com.
