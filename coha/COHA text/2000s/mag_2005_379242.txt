In what experts say is a welcome nod to common sense , the CIA , having spent billions over the years on undercover agents , phone taps and the like , plans to create a large wing in the spookhouse dedicated to sorting through various forms of data that are not secret  --  such as research articles , religious tracts , websites , even phone books  --  but yet could be vital to national security . Senior intelligence officials tell TIME that CIA Director Porter Goss plans to launch by Oct. 1 an " open source " unit that will greatly expand on the work of the respected but cash-strapped office that currently translates foreign-language broadcasts and documents like declarations by extremist clerics . The budget , which could be in the ballpark of $100 million , is to be carefully monitored by John Negroponte , the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) , who discussed the new division with Goss in a meeting late last month . " We will want this to be a separate , identifiable line in the CIA program so we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we do n't want money moved from it without Negroponte 's approval , " said a senior official in the DNI 's office . <P> Critics have charged in the past that despite the proven value of open-source information , the government has tended to give more prominence to reports gained through cloak-and-dagger efforts . One glaring example : the CIA failed in 1998 to predict a nuclear test in India , even though the country 's Prime Minister had campaigned on a platform promising a robust atomic-weapons program . <P> " If it does n't have the SECRET stamp on it , it really is n't treated very seriously , " says Michael Scheuer , former chief of the CIA 's Osama bin Laden unit . The idea of an open-source unit did n't gain traction until a White House commission recommended creating one last spring . Utilizing it will require " cultural and attitudinal changes , " says the senior DNI official . Sure , watching TV and listening to the radio may not sound terribly sexy , but , says Scheuer , " there 's no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do than to read what he says . "  --  By Timothy J.
