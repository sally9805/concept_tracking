IN MORE than fifty years of a writing career that has produced well beyond 1700 stories and articles and reviews and blahblahblah , there have only been 2 - count ' em - 2 ideas I have n't been able to transmogrify into full narrative . <p> Two . <p> A pair of story-ideas I knew were terrific , but which have obstinately repulsed my every attempt , over decades , to pry loose the tender flesh in those lobster claws . <p> What every professional knows ( whether s/he has ever written and sold a story or not ) , is the core secret that makes every pro or wannabe a capable storyteller of professional ability , an idea is not a story . <p> We all get a hundred " good ideas " a day . And occasionally we say , " Boy , that would make a great story . " And even less often we actually write the story . Once in a great while it is a great story . More often , it is , at best , of professional quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is a helluva jump , however , from Alfred Bester thinking , " In a society where everyone is telepathic , how do you commit a murder and get away with it ? " which is a peat idea , - and writing The Demolished Man , which is a great story . <p> You can ruminate about how interesting it would be to investigate the clash between a self-made hustler from a vulgarian background , and entitled but " casual " cliques with money , but it 's a helluva jump from that nubbin to Washington Square , The Great Gatsby , or An American Tragedy , all of which proceed logically , professionally , from that same nubbin . <p> So when I say I have gnawed the nubbins to greater and lesser creations of story , you may be assured I am spreading my ink-stained paws in frustration and self-effacement when I admit to being totally , absolutely , everlastingly stumped by two errant eidolons . <p> Apart from resenting myself for allowing a good one to lie fallow , thus depriving me of a payday ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying to find out what happens in those two ideas . And so ... <p> I called Mr. Van Gelder , head gargoyle at this cathedral , and I said , " Why do n't I sorta kinda devise a challenge , a write-off , a ... well ... an endeavor . I would lay out the basic story idea , the nubbin , in a few lines , as much and as far as I 've gotten in all those years ; and then you offer the challenge to maybe half a dozen of your best , sharpest , most arrogant writers , new or old , and let them write their own story around that nubbin . <p> " Let them go where they want , create characters as they want , restrict them in no way as long as the basic idea is the core of the story . What I 've done will be kept to an absolute minimum - " <p> When you start to write a story , you have one hundred percent of your choices available . The instant you write " the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " he , " your choices are reduced by fifty percent . And each word thereafter narrows your venue proportionately . Until you 've predestined where your story must go . <p> " - because I want them to create absolutely as much as they 'll need to tell their own tales . If I start with a characterization of the principals , that reduces their options by fifty percent . If I pick the setting , there goes another slice of choice pastrami . Pick the year and the wedge is even thinner . So I 'll give the teeniest minim for a good bunch of professionals to dote on . <p> " I have insisted that Mr. Van Celder choose wisely . The writers must have sold a few stories , no amateurs thank you very much . They must be at least as good as I ( virtually impossible , but what the hell , no harm in asking ) . And they must be given full and total freedom to do with the nubbin what they will . <p> I herewith and for all eternity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruition , convey permission for these writers selected by Mr. Van Gelder to use the material herewith profferred . I absolve this magazine of any claims on my part to ownership of the material . This prologue is copyrighted and registered , and my name is Trademarked and Registered , so bear that in mind , but beyond that , the way is clear . <p> Now . Here is the idea that 's been tumbling in my mental bingo cage for at least forty years : <p> Lady Luck is wending her way through a gambling venue . Could be a Vegas or Atlantic City casino , a Mississippi riverboat , a 1930s betting parlor , a horsetrack , a cockfight in Havana , a slot machine gallery in a private men 's club in London , a paramutual parlor , or any other locale . <p> I see her in my mind 's eye view as looking a lot like Milton Caniff 's Dragon Lady . But she can be any age , size , appearance , upholstered female one chooses . I see her svelte and slinky : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lena Home on Catfish Row , Veronica from the Archie comics , Marta Toren in " Paris Express . " Others may see her as nine years old with a teddy bear , eighty years old with a walker , obese in a homestead sackdress pulling a slot handle , or just average looking , a pleasant-seeming Everywoman . <p> She is wending , touching one guy , then another , letting the men win a hand or a roll or a spin . Nothing much . She 's doing her job . <p> But then , a guy comes in , sees her , and is " struck by the hammer , " la The Godfather . He is smitten beyond measure . Smit-TEN . Smited , smote , smoot , knocked on his ass with True Love . He follows her around . He can see her . <p> The only problem is , he wo n't leave her alone . He dogs her , sycophantic and smooten . She can not get rid of the guy . <p> And the other , uh , small complication is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked the Earth . <p> That 's it . That 's all of it . And even what I 've given you here is malleable , plastic , up for grabs . <p> I think the essentials : Lady Luck , schnook , True Love , are what form the basic nubbin ; but beyond that , I 'm told change is a healthy thing . <p> Mr. Van Gelder , the ball is in your court . <p> I 'm dying to read my stories , to see how it all comes out . <p> - Harlan Ellison <p>
