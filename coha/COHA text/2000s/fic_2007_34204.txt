Clutching the mail in one hand , Grady Weston paced the narrow corridor inside the post office . He glanced distractedly at the row of mailboxes , gathering his courage before he approached Caroline Daniels , the postmistress . His tongue felt as if it 'd wrapped itself around his front teeth , and he was beginning to doubt he 'd be able to utter a single sensible word . It should n't be so damned difficult to let a woman know he found her attractive ! " Grady ? " Caroline 's voice reached out to him . He spun around , not seeing her . Great . Not only was he dreaming about her , now he was hearing her voice . " Open your box , " she instructed . He fumbled for the key and twisted open the small rectangular door , then peered in.Sure enough , Caroline was there.Not all of her , just her brown eyes , her pert little nose and lovely mouth . If he 'd possessed his brother 's gift for flattery , Grady would have said something clever.Made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding " Hello . " " Hi . " Caroline had beautiful eyes , dark and rich like freshly brewed coffee , which was about as poetic as Grady got . Large and limpid , they reminded him of a calf 's , but he figured that might not be something awoman wanted to hear , even if he considered it a compliment . This was the problem , Grady decided . He did n't know how to talk to a woman . In fact , it 'd been more than six years since he 'd gone out on an actual date . " Can I help you with anything ? " she asked . He wanted to invite her to lunch , and although that seemed a simple enough request , he could n't make himself ask her . Probably because their relationship so far had n't been too promising . Calling it a " relationship " was n't really accurate , since they 'd barely exchanged a civil word and had never so much as held hands . Mostly they snapped at each other , disagreed and argued-if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ; it 'd been nice , but only when he could stop worrying about stepping on her toes . Who was he kidding ? Holding Caroline in his arms had been more than nice , it had been wonderful . In the month since , he had n't been able to stop thinking about that one dance . Every night when he climbed into bed and closed his eyes , Caroline was there to greet him . He could still feel her softness against him , could almost smell the faint scent of her cologne . The dance had been ladies ' choice , and that was enough to let him believe-hope-she might actually hold some regard for him , too.Despite their disagreements , he 'd been the one she 'd chosen to ask . " You had lunch yet ? " Grady asked , his voice brusque . He did n't mean to sound angry or unfriendly . The timbre of his voice and his abrupt way of speaking had caused him plenty of problems with Maggie , Caroline 's five-year-old daughter . He 'd been trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only limited success . But he 'd tried . He hoped Caroline and Maggie gave him credit for that . Caroline 's mouth broke into a wide grin . " Lunch ? Not yet , and I 'm starved . " Grady 's spirits lifted considerably . " Well , then , I was thinking , seeing as I have n't eaten myself . " The words stumbled all over themselves in his eagerness to get them out . " You want to join me ? " " Sure , but let me get this straight . Is this an invitation , as in a date ? " " No . " His response was instinctive , given without thought . He 'd been denying his feelings for her so long that his answer had come automatically . He feared , too , that she might misread his intentions . He was attracted to Caroline and he wanted to know her better , but beyond that-he was n't sure . Hell , what he knew about love and marriage would n't fill a one-inch column of the Promise Gazette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Understood . Give me a few minutes and I 'll meet you out front . " She moved out of his range of vision . Grady closed the box , but left his hand on the key . How could anyone with the skills to run a thriving cattle ranch in the Texas hill country be such a fool when it came to women ? He rapped on the post-office box hard enough to hurt his knuckles . " Caroline ! " Then he realized he had to open the box . He did that , then stared through it and shouted for her a second time . " Caroline ! " Her face appeared , eyes snapping with impatience . " What 's the rush ? " she demanded . " I said it 'd take me a few minutes . " The edges of the postbox cut into his forehead and chin and knocked his Stetson askew . " This is a date , all right ? " She stared back at him from the other side , and either she was overwhelmed by his offer to buy her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he repeated . " This is a date . " She continued to look at him . " I should n't have asked , " she finally said . " I 'm glad you did . " And he was . He could think of no better way to set things straight . He had n't invited her to lunch because he needed someone to pass the time with ; if that was what he 'd wanted , he could have asked his sister , Savannah , or her husband or Cal Patterson-or any number of people . No , he 'd asked Caroline because he wanted to be with her . For once he longed to talk to her without interference or advice from his matchmaking sister . It did n't help to have Maggie there hiding her face in her mother 's lap every time he walked into the room , either . This afternoon it 'd be just the two of them . Caroline and him . Grady respectfully removed his hat when she joined him in the lobby . " This is a pleasant surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . " He did n't mention that he 'd rearranged his entire day for this opportunity . It was hard enough admitting that to himself , let alone Caroline . " Where would you like to eat ? " he asked . The town had three good restaurants : the caf in the bowling alley ; the Chili Pepper , a Texas barbecue place ; and a Mexican restaurant run by the Chavez family . " How about Mexican Lindo ? " Caroline suggested . It was the one he would have chosen himself . " Great . " Since the restaurant was on Fourth Avenue , only two blocks from the post office , they walked there , chatting as they went . Or rather , Caroline chatted and he responded with grunts and murmurs . Grady had long ago realized he lacked the ability to make small talk . Unlike his younger brother , Richard , who could charm his way into-or out of-anything . Grady tried not to feel inadequate , but he was distinctly relieved when they got to the restaurant . In a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bowl of tortilla chips along with a dish of extra-hot salsa . He reached for a chip , scooped up as much salsa as it would hold and popped it in his mouth . He ate another and then another before he noticed that Caroline had n't touched a single chip . He raised his eyes to hers and stopped chewing , his mouth full . Caroline apparently read the question in his eyes . " I do n't eat corn chips , " she explained . " I fill up on them and then I do n't have room for anything else . " He swallowed and nodded . " Oh . " A moment of silence passed , and Grady wondered if her comment was a subtle hint that she was watching her weight . From what he understood , weight was a major preoccupation with women . Maybe she was waiting for him to tell her she should n't worry about it ; maybe he was supposed to say she looked great . She did . She was slender and well proportioned , and she wore her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . In his opinion she looked about as perfect as a woman could get . Someday he 'd tell her that , but not just yet . Besides , he did n't want her to think he was only interested in deal about her , especially the way she was raising Maggie on her own . She understood the meaning of the words responsibility and sacrifice , just like he did . She was staring at him as if she expected a comment , and Grady realized he needed to say something . " You could be fat and I 'd still have asked you to lunch . " Her smooth brow crumpled in a puzzled frown . " I meant that as a compliment , " he sputtered and decided then and there it was better to keep his trap shut . Thankfully the waitress came to take their order . Grady decided on chicken enchiladas ; Caroline echoed his choice . " This is really very nice , " she said and reached for the tall glass of iced tea . " I wanted us to have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular reason ? " Grady rested his spine against the back of his chair and boldly met her look . " I like you , Caroline . " He did n't know any way to be other than direct . This had gotten him into difficulties over the years . Earlier that spring he 'd taken a dislike to Laredo Smith and had n't been shy about letting his sister and everyone else know his feelings . But he 'd been wrong in his assessment of the man 's character . Smith 's truck had broken down and Savannah had brought him home to the ranch . Over Grady 's objections she 'd hired him herself , and before long they 'd fallen in love . It came as a shock to watch his sane sensible sister give her heart to a perfect stranger . Still , Grady was n't proud of the way he 'd behaved . By the time Laredo decided it 'd be better for everyone concerned if he moved on , Grady had wanted him to stay . He 'd gone so far as to offer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change his mind . Not that it 'd done any driven him away , but it had also brought him back . Savannah and Laredo had married in short order and were now involved in designing plans for their own home , plus raising quarter horses . Savannah , with her husband 's active support , continued to grow the antique roses that were making her a name across the state . In the weeks since becoming his brother-in-law , Laredo had proved himself a damn good friend and Grady 's right-hand man . " I like you , too , " Caroline said , but she lowered her gaze as she spoke , breaking eye contact . This seemed to be something an admission for them both . " You do ? " Grady felt light-headed with joy . It was all he could do not to leap in the air and click his heels . " We 've known each other a lot of years . " " I 've known you most of my life , " he agreed , but as he said the words , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he wanted , not the way he hoped he would one day . It was n't just that he had no idea who 'd fathered Maggie ; apparently no one else in town did , either . He wondered what had attracted her to this man , why she had n't married him . Or why he 'd left her to deal with the pregnancy and birth alone . It all remained a mystery . Another thing Grady did n't understand about Caroline was the changes in her since her daughter 's In time Grady believed she 'd trust him enough to answer his questions , and he prayed he 'd say and do the right thing when Their lunches arrived and they ate , stopping to chat now and then . The conversation did n't pall , but again he had to credit Caroline with the skill to keep it going . Half an hour later , as he escorted her back to the post office , Grady was walking on air . " I 'll give you a call tomorrow , " he said , watching her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he added , needing her reassurance . " Sure . " Her response was neither encouraging nor discouraging . " I 'd like to talk to Maggie again , if she 'll let me . " " You might try this afternoon , since she 's spending the day with Savannah . " This was news to Grady , but he 'd been busy that morning and had left the house early . He had n't spoken to Savannah other than a few words over breakfast , and even if he 'd known Maggie was staying with his sister , he would n't have had time to chat with the girl that morning . " I 'll make a point of saying hello , " he said . His heart lifted when it suddenly struck him that he 'd be seeing Caroline again later in the day , when she came to pick up Maggie . They parted . Whistling , Grady sauntered across the asphalt parking lot toward his truck . He felt damn good . The afternoon had gone better than he 'd hoped . He was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Grady , have you got a moment ? " The older man , owner of the local Western-wear store , quickened his pace . " Howdy , Max . " Grady grinned from ear to ear and did n't let the somber expression on Max 's face get him down . " What can I do for you ? " Max shuffled his feet a couple of times , looking uncomfortable . " You know I hate to mention this a second time , but Richard still has n't paid me for the clothes he bought three months ago . " The happy excitement Grady had experienced only moments earlier died a quick death . " It was my understanding Richard mailed you a check . " " He told me the same thing , but it 's been more than two weeks now and nothing 's come . I do n't feel I should have to wait any longer . " " I do n't think you should , either . I 'll speak to him myself , " Grady promised . " I hate to drag you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear from his shaky voice how much the subject distressed him . " Do n't worry about it , Max . I understand . " The older man nodded and turned away . Grady climbed into his truck and clenched the steering wheel with both hands as the anger flooded through him . Leave it to his brother to lie and cheat and steal ! What infuriated Grady was that he had no one to blame but himself . He 'd allowed Richard to continue living on the Yellow Rose . Allowed him to tarnish the family name . Allowed himself to believe , to hope , that the years away had changed his brother . All his illusions had been shattered . They were destroyed like so much else Richard had touched . He 'd done his damnedest to ruin Grady , and he 'd come close . But Richard had succeeded in ruining his own life-his potential to be a different person , a worthwhile human being . Charming and personable , a born leader , Richard could have accomplished great things . Instead , he 'd used his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person he 'd cheated most had been himself . Six years earlier Richard had forged Grady 's signature and absconded with the cash their parents had left-cash that would have paid the inheritance taxes on the ranch and covered the burial expenses . Grady and Savannah had found themselves penniless following the tragedy that had claimed their parents ' lives . It 'd taken six long , backbreaking , frustration-filled years to crawl out of debt . Grady had sacrificed those years to hold on to the ranch while Richard had squandered the money . When it had run out , he 'd returned home with his tail between his legs , looking for a place to stay until he received a severance check from his last job-or so he 'd said . Deep down Grady had wanted to believe in Richard . His sister had begged him to let their younger brother stay . But she did n't need to beg very hard or very long for him to relent . Unfortunately it had become apparent that a liar and a cheat did n't change overnight-or in six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he 'd stolen from his family . Despite the air conditioner , the heat inside the truck cab sucked away Grady 's energy . It should have come as no surprise to discover that Richard had lied to him again . This time would be the last , Grady vowed . Oh , yes , this episode was the proverbial last straw .
