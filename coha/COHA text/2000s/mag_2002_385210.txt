// The sun is the best friend the garden has , and in the early spring its light stirs every gardener , plant , and seed , whether they live in a warm country or where the ground is still frozen . That 's what makes the first of March the most exciting time there is ! The whole growing year is ahead of us , no matter where we live , and we are full of hopes and plans for what we are going to do . We must decide where we can have our posy patch , what we shall grow , and where we shall buy our seeds . Seed catalogs are more interesting than most catalogs . They tell you how to plant and grow seeds , and describe everything so that you want some of all the seeds listed . So you must be sure and make your list carefully ! If this is our first garden , let 's ask the grown  --  ups to give us a piece of ground that has been used as a garden at least a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not begin with good ground , we may get discouraged . If you live where the ground is never frozen you can plant seeds right out in the garden , even as early as the first of March . But if you live where the ground freezes , you must plant the seeds of tender plants in a box in a sunny window . After they have grown to sturdy little plants , set them out in the garden . Let 's divide our garden into four equal parts , making two paths that cross each other . The word " garden " means enclosure , something you go into . If you have two crossing paths and four equal beds , you have a center , and that makes you feel that you are truly in a garden . Then you can reach each plant more easily to care for it . The path can be a tiny one with just enough room for us to walk in . Now let 's take a galvanized iron pan and paint the inside with dark blue paint . We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each coat to dry before we put on the next . When the last coat is dry , we must dig a hole as large and as deep as the pan-right in the very middle of our garden-and put our pan in it so that the top is level with the soil . Very close to the edge of the pan , plant an ivy vine , and carefully heap earth all around the pan . Then take hairpins and pin the vine to the ground to make a dark green edge to our pan . Fill the pan with water-and we have a darling pool for goldfish ! At the back of our garden we need a bench . Choose pansies for a border , though we shall have to buy the plants . Pansies do not stay in bloom all summer , so let 's buy petunia seeds and plant them in a row behind the pansy plants . Let 's plant a row of ageratum behind the petunias because it loves to grow anywhere , is beautiful to pick , and has blue flowers that bloom a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a tall ageratum in the seed catalogs ; choose the middle-size . Fill all that is left of the beds with seeds of zinnias , and from early spring until late fall , we shall have flowers in our garden . Even though the ground is frozen , it is always possible by the first of March to find a place in the garden where the sun has thawed the top . Take a hoe and shovel and scrape up some of that soil . Bring it in the house , let it dry for a day or two , then sift it . Use any piece of screen or old strainer . The most important thing about growing a plant in the house is to have the soil sifted . It is so much more natural for any seed or plant to grow outdoors than indoors that when you ask it to grow in the house , you must give it better soil to grow in . Soil is the real name for that part of the ground , or dirt , that has been made fine for plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their roots out into lumps . That is why we spade , rake , and hoe a garden-to break the ground fine enough for the roots to go into it . // To sow seeds indoors , you need to fill a shallow box with potting soil . Sprinkle the soil until it is very wet . You will have to add almost again as much soil because it will settle . Wait until the next day to sow your seed . Petunia seeds are as fine as pepper , so fill a saucer with soil that is perfectly dry , then pour the petunia seeds onto this soil and stir it many times with a fork . Make tiny furrows in the soil and drop a little of the mixture into each furrow . These furrows do not need to be covered , for when you water them , they will be covered enough . Do not begin to look for plants for two weeks , and when they do come , they will be as fine as moss . Never let the soil get dry , and watch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
