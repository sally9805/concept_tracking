<p> georgetown Rescuers did not lower an air supply to five workers trapped inside a smoky hydroelectric conduit until 2 1/2 hours after a fire broke out , officials said Wednesday . <p> The five contractors perished inside the 12-foot-wide concrete-and-steel tunnel Tuesday after sparking a fire in some fresh epoxy they were applying , even though they sent a radio message that they were still all OK an hour later . <p> As recovery crews retrieved the bodies , dozens of state and federal officials converged at the scene to investigate what went wrong . <p> Gov . Bill Ritter committed several state agencies to the task as the contractor that hired the workers , RPI Coating of Santa Fe Springs , Calif. , searched for explanations . <p> " We 're all devastated by this today , " said Marc Dyer , director of sales and marketing at RPI , also known as Robison-Prezioso Inc . <p> The delay in lowering scuba- style tanks and masks Tuesday was because rescue crews had to figure out where the trapped workers had taken refuge in the 4,000-foot tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel , which reduced visibility . <p> The bodies of the five men were found within 200 feet of each other . They apparently never had a chance to use the air tanks or masks , according to Clear Creek County Undersheriff Stu Nay . <p> Rescuers used high-volume fans from the top of the tunnel to clear the smoke . <p> Visibility about 3 feet <p> It took a while for would-be rescuers from a dozen different agencies - coming from as far away as the metro area - to arrive and launch the search . <p> Heavy smoke was pouring out of the bottom of the 12-foot-wide tunnel , said Jim Arnold , general manager of the Henderson Mine outside Empire , 15 highway miles from Georgetown . <p> Initial reports Tuesday said the tunnel was 4 feet wide . <p> " There 's preparation you have to do , " Arnold said . " We had to get people to the mine . We had to get our equipment set up and get suited up . We had to set out a plan : What do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bottom ? If you were there , you would have thought it happened awfully quickly . " <p> The team prepares in similar environments and is composed of medically trained personnel and specialists in engineering , ventilation and even chemistry in case they encounter " oddball chemicals " like the burning epoxy in the pipe . <p> With a backup team in place in case the initial team got into trouble - and another team from a Nevada gold mine that happened to be training in the area - five-member units from the Henderson mine-rescue team entered the bottom of the pipe about 5:45 p.m . Tuesday . <p> They wore full face masks providing air and initially encountered visibility of about 3 feet , Arnold said . <p> They were optimistic the contractors would be found alive , he said . <p> At 7:51 p.m. , the crew reached the trapped men , discovered they were dead , and retreated , leaving the bodies to be recovered Wednesday . <p> The men , whose bodies were found scattered along a 200 foot length of the pipe , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died from the smoke and fumes from the chemical fire , officials said Wednesday night . <p> Exacting safety needed <p> Even Wednesday 's recovery effort proved deliberate . West Metro firefighters checked the air quality every 100 feet as they led a second team , made up of Clear Creek County personnel and CBI investigators . <p> The recovery teams reached the victims about 3:20 p.m . Wednesday and the bodies were removed one by one , with the task completed in the evening . The bodies were taken to the Jefferson County coroner 's office in Golden . <p> The workers were identified as Donald Dejaynes , 43 ; Dupree Holt , 37 ; James St. Peters , 52 ; Gary Foster , 48 ; Anthony Aguirre , 18 ; all of California . Their hometowns were n't immediately available . <p> The work at the Xcel plant was scheduled more than a year ago after a routine inspection revealed pitting in the concrete , he said . The company began work there Sept. 4 , and they were scheduled to finish by the first part of November . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet from the lower end of a tunnel that brings water from the Upper Cabin Creek Reservoir to the Lower Cabin Creek Reservoir and to the hydroelectric plant . <p> Nay said the epoxy mixture is kept in a hopper to warm it so it will flow through a sprayer . He said the workers were having problems spraying so they added a solvent to the hopper and the hopper 's heating element inadvertently turned on , igniting the vapors . <p> There were 11 men in the crew . Four were below the fire and two were outside . Five of the six survivors were injured , one of them after he raced into the tunnel to help . <p> One injured victim was still being treated Wednesday night in the burn unit at a Denver hospital . The others were treated and released . <p> The workers who survived saw the other five climb the 4,000-foot tunnel . The victims last communicated by radio about a hour after the fire broke out and reported no injuries . But the tunnel was slick and steep . <p> " The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the fire , " Nay said . <p> The victims were wearing Tyvek suits and masks commonly used by painters - but did not have scuba-type air supplies . <p> " We 've done a lot of projects like this one and never had trouble before , " Dyer said . " These men were very experienced people . This is a challenging project because of the degree of angles of the pipe ( slopes ) . <p> " The epoxy coating being applied does not present a lot of danger under normal circumstances . " <p> A local expert said painting in confined spaces is hazardous , requiring meticulous safety measures . <p> " You 've got to keep all of your atmospheric conditions under control , " said Jeff Szalkowski , a 17-year veteran of applying industrial coatings in both Colorado and Alaska . " You have to keep an air supply moving through the pipe , with both negative and positive air-pressure fans . They also should have had gas-monitoring detectors with them . " <p> An Xcel spokesman said the safety of the men was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field , and that 's why we hired them , " said spokesman Tom Henley . <p> Mark Salley , spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment , said he was not aware of any licensing or permitting requirements for confined-space painters . Chris Liens , spokesman for Colorado 's Department of Regulatory Agencies , said the state does not regulate the application of industrial coatings . <p> The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the U.S. Chemical Safety Board are investigating . <p> Families of victims , who began arriving in Georgetown on Wednesday afternoon , were being offered grief counseling . <p> " We have to take care of the families , " Nay said . " The care of them is a priority to us . " <p> The Georgetown Mountain Inn offered the families free lodging through the week . <p> Sally Kennerson , chief executive of the Idaho Springs Chamber of Commerce , which includes Georgetown , said the community is mourning the tragedy even though none of the victims were local . <p> " I do n't think anybody realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Being a mining community , we 're always prepared for mining disasters . I do n't think we even thought of that as a place where we would lose people .
