IN CHOOSING THE COVER FOR THIS SPECIAL Inaugural Issue , Ms. wanted to capture both the national and feminist mood of high expectations and hope as the 44th president of the United States takes the oath of office . Two weeks before the election , Barack Obama joked at the Al Smith dinner , " Contrary to the rumors you have heard , I was not born in a manger . I was actually born on Krypton DC Comics ' fictional birthplace of Superman and sent here by my father Jor-El to save the planet . " Expectations have only grown since the election , with Obama now enjoying some 70 percent of the public 's support . Most people wish him well , and indeed hope he does " save " us from economic disasters , unending war and occupation , global warming , the decline in our international reputation , and relendess attacks on women 's rights , civil rights , human rights , science , privacy ... the list goes on . When the chair of the Feminist Majority Foundation board , Peg Yorkin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am a feminist . " And better yet , he ran on the strongest platform for women 's rights of any major party in U.S. history . Feminist Karen Kornbluh , the platform 's principal author , ensured that women 's rights , opportunities , advancement and issues were addressed throughout the historic document . I will never forget Obama 's inspiring Democratic convention acceptance speech or the emotional reaction of the 84,000 people in the stadium that night . I was fortunate to be sitting right next to 96-year-old Dorothy Height , the grande dame of the civil rights movement , who had marched with Martin Luther King , Jr . and who , together with the legendary feminist leader Molly Yard , had begun her extraordinary journey working with Eleanor Roosevelt . Dorothy had-we all had-lived to see what few had dared to imagine not so many years ago . Nor will I forget what Barack Obama cautioned in his eloquent and inspiring election night speech : " The road ahead will be long . Our climb will be steep . " We are all beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost immediately after that unforgettable victory night-what tears of joy and relief ! - we began working with members of the Obama-Biden transition team , urging more women appointments , making sure women were not forgotten in the economic recovery package , and focusing on the reversal of horrific Bush-era executive orders , regulations and legislative mandates that attacked women 's rights . These are exciting times of high hopes-and yet there are already crushing disappointments . For example , in one 24-hour period I went from utter despair upon hearing that Pastor Rick Warren was asked to deliver the inaugural invocation to utter joy upon hearing that feminist , Latina champion Hilda Solis was selected to be secretary of labor . I was outraged that a man who used religion to divide people and to malign lesbians and gay men was given the honor of this elevated ceremonial position . But I rejoiced in how Solis could use her new position to help the struggling labor movement and countless working women and men . And Obama 's Cabinet also includes many other friends to women 's rights : Joe Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Hillary Clinton , who has declared that women 's rights are human rights and will be a symbol and champion for women globally ; and Janet Napolitano , who chaired the Democratic Platform Drafting Committee . Yes , there are worrisome appointments and not enough women in the Cabinet , but perhaps we have the beginnings of-to use another fictional image from DC Comics - a " Justice League " of superheroes . Never has it been easy fighting for equality and social justice . The poUtics of Washington , our nation and our world are tough . We in the feminist movement should know : We have fought for equality for years , upon years , upon years - hometown by hometown , state by state , nationwide , indeed worldwide . But we have spent far too many years fighting to keep the ground we had already gained . Now is the time to move forward . We are in one of those rare transformational times in history . " This is our moment , " Obama has proclaimed over and over again . " This is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , as United Farmworkers cofounder Dolores Huerta has long exhorted , " Si , se puede ! " For our hopes to be achieved , we must speak out and organize , organize , organize to enable our new president 's team to achieve our common goals . Ultimately , we must hold our leaders ' feet to the fire or , to put it more positively , uplift them when they are caught in the crosscurrents of competing interests . Now is our time to think big . We can not settle for less-too many women 's lives , too many people 's lives , depend upon it . In this spirit , the editors of Mr. magazine have asked our readers and feminist leaders , experts and activists to share their visions of what must be done to move forward at this extraordinary time . What follows is a sampUng of what 's on their minds and in their hearts . - ELEANOR SMEAL CEMENT EQUAL RIGHTS . Establishing a Cabinetlevel Office on Women would be a good start , foUowed by appointment of judges who will ensure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caU to pass the ERA , and dius include women in the U.S. Constitution , and he should urge the Senate to ratify the U.N . Convention on the Elimination of AU Forms of Discrimination Against Women ( CEDAW ) without weakening amendments ( see page 12 ) . - KIM QANDY , PRESIDENT . NOW SOW EDUCATION , REAP REWARDS . To solve the most challenging problems facing our world , President Obama should actively promote global gender equality . For every additional year of education a woman receives beyond die fourth grade , her average family size drops by 20 percent , her children 's mortaUty rates drop by 10 percent and her risk of HIV/AIDS infection drops by over 50 percent . - KAVITA RAMDAS , PRESIDENT AND CEO , GLOBAL FUND FOR WOMEN GIVE GIRLS WHAT THEY WANT . As girls ages 8 through 15 , we 're so excited that Malia and Sasha will be in the White House ! What we need from the president is better health care for girls and more opportunities for college - not just getting in , but paying for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many women and girls are dying there . As we grow up , we need choices about our own bodies and we need equal pay . Most of all , we need a president who Ustens to all girls and respects us . P.S. We 're sending Malia and Sasha a four-year membership to New Moon Girls . - MEMBERS OF NEWMOONQIRLS.COM SUPPORT GAY RIGHTS . Feminists must stand in solidarity with the queer community and make sure we can attain marriage equality for same-sex couples . The passage of Proposition 8 in California showed me that this country still has a long way to go . - MARGARET CHO , ACTOR AND COMEDIAN CUT OFF ABSTINENCE-ONLY FUNDS . President Obama can eliminate the nearly $200 million a year going toward failed **30;637;TOOLONG programs from the budget he submits to Congress in February , and return to funding evidence-based programs that will foster a generation of sexually healthy and happy adults . - SHELBY KNOX , SEX-EDUCATION ACTIVIST , SUBJECT OF THE DOCUMENTARY FILM THE EDUCATION OF SHELBY KNOX DO N'T PLAY POLITICAL FOOTBALL WITH WOMEN . You only had to see " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCain in the presidential debate to understand just how bad it 's gotten . But we 're hopeful , because Barack Obama is a woman 's man . Raised by a single , independent mother , married to a woman every bit his equal and father of two smart young daughters , it 's obvious President Obama gets us . He unapologetically believes in our rights . We 're ready to get down to what women need : affordable , quality healdi care and the unalienable right to make our own decisions about childbearing . - CECILE RICHARD8 , PRESIDENT , PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION OF AMERICA CLOSE FAKE CLINICS . How about we shut down all the anti-choice centers posing as pregnancy clinics and turn them into Dunkin ' Donuts ? - KATHY NAJIMY , ACTOR ENSURE WOMEN CAN EARN . The road to social parity for women of all cultures , including Afghanistan , is the same : universal education for girls , access to health care and family planning for women , and , above all , the means to earn money . Earnings give a woman a voice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else will elevate a woman as quickly in any culture , including our own . - MAVIS LENO , CHAIR , FEMINIST MAJORITY FOUNDATION 'S CAMPAIGN TO HELP AFGHAN WOMEN AND GIRLS ELEVATE WOMEN SCIENTISTS . President Obama can encourage young women to enter careers in science and technology by appointing distinguished women to influential positions in such federal agencies as the National Institutes of Healdi and the National Science Foundation . Young women need to believe that they have a place in science , and success breeds success . - SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN , PRESIDENT , PRINCETON UNIVERSITY LIGHTEN EARTH 'S LOAD . Nothing is more important than that human beings begin to limit , drastically and immediately , dieir presence on the Earth . We must make obsolete the habit of projecting huge increases in the number of people expected to be born , and acting as if diese pro- jections are inevitable and natural . They are neither . It is women who are responsible for giving birth , and it is sim- ply not in any woman 's self-interest to have more children than she herself can provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet . Population decisions must , ultimately , be placed in the hands of women . If men expect to live very much longer on this Earth , they will have to accept this reality . We need leadership that is not stuck in religious , societal or moral doublespeak . As we enter what may be a new period of enlightened awareness of our peril and a heightened sense of what is possible , it is my hope that we will demand from our leaders the same passion that we possess : to lighten our Mother 's load , hear her cries of distress , and discipline ourselves away from a vanity that makes us think Earth is all about us. - ALICE WALKER , ESSAYIST , POET , NOVELIST AND ACTIVIST ; AUTHOR OF WE ARE THE ONES WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR COUNT MATERNAL DEATH AS VIOLENCE . We should expand the definition of violence against women to include maternal mortality and lack of access to family planning and safe abortion . Surely no woman can plan her Ufe if she is going to the in childbirth or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as are beatings , rape or honor killings . - JANE ROBERTS , COFOUNDER , 34 MILLION FRIENDS OF THE U.N . POPULATION FUND SUPPORT TRUE GREEN SOLUTIONS . Green roofing , urban forestry and healthy wetlands throughout our cities , suburbs and countryside could reduce the burden on traditional infrastructure , provide great local jobs and clean the air and water we all depend on for healthy lives . - MAJORA CARTER , FOUNDER , SUSTAINABLE SOUTH BRONX ; ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT BEAR WITH US . How about we work to preserve a small patch of healthy grass for my kids ' kids to Slip n ' Slide on - and maybe a litde cube of ice so polar bears have somewhere to sit ? - KATHY NAJlMY , ACTOR MAKE DREAMS COME TRUE . The historic election of a black president takes the dual mission of the YWCA-eliminating racism and empowering women-out of the dream state and into a world of possibility . - LORRAINE COLE , CEO , YWCA USA MAKE ENOUGH BE ENOUGH . The late Alice Trillin coined the principle of " enoughism , " a threshold of wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a threshold below which no one can thrive . We should work to make this principle common sense . Even if the thresholds are modest , enoughism could transform the Uves of women and children worldwide and reorient policy fields ranging from the environment to human rights to economics . - WENDY BROWN , POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR , UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY LET WOMEN REPAIR INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT . We must hold the U.N . to its own rule that women be brought front and center in peace negotiations and post-conflict rebuilding . Women 's fully empowered presence in resolving conflicts would forever alter these processes-and perhaps post-conflict would no longer just be another synonym for pre-war . - ABIGAIL DISNEY , PRODUCER OF THE DOCUMENTARY FILM PRAY THE DEVIL BACK TO HELL PROSECUTE WAR CRIMINALS . Now is the time for the U.S. to join the International Criminal Court , the world 's first-ever permanent war crimes tribunal . Transnational feminist activists have successfully ensured that systematic wartime rape and sexual slavery are crimes prosecutable by the ICC . One hundred and eight countries have ratified the treaty that established the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , Yemen , Qatar and , yes , the United States . Barack Obama needs to sign the treaty , then send it to the Senate for ratification . - CYNTHIA ENLOE , RESEARCH PROFESSOR , CLARK UNIVERSITY ROOT OUT MILITARY RAPE . As commander in chief , President Obama can direct the military never to tolerate or hide the sexual persecution of its women again , and to lift the ban against women in combat , which denies them the respect they have earned . Today , even as women soldiers are fighting and dying in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , their treatment by their comrades is a national scandal . They are sent into combat without official recognition , one-third are sexually assaulted and almost all are harassed . Here is Obama 's chance to take on military misogyny at its roots . - HELEN BENEDICT , AUTHOR OF THE FORTHCOMING THE LONELY SOLDIER : THE PRIVATE WAR OF WOMEN SERVING IN IRAQ ( BEACON PRESS , APRIL ) POLICE THE TRAFFICKERS . An estimated 27 million people , mosdy women and girls , are victims of human trafficking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecute traffickers fully at home and abroad . By repairing and strengthening our country 's relationships with our international neighbors , Barack Obama can empower the global response that is required to combat the modern-day slave trade . - KAMALA HARRIS , DISTRICT ATTORNEY , SAN FRANCISCO LET THE SURVIVORS LEAD . The violence-againstwomen movement has to , once again , become a movement and not just a network of social-service providers . Violence will only end when survivors are seen as potential organizers on their own behalf , rather than simply cUents of social workers , lawyers , judges or medical personnel . - ANDREA SMITH , PROFESSOR OF AMERICAN CULTURE AND WOMEN 'S STUDIES , UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ; COFOUNDER , INCITEI WOMEN OF COLOR AGAINST VIOLENCE GO LOCAL . Let 's transform the U.S. from a global bully into a source of support for grassroots women 's movements around the world . Support local women 's movements without co-opting diem . Remove ideological strings on U.S. aid and give communities the power to dictate their own needs . Simply Usten to women . We 're talking . - JILL FILIPOVlC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , teachers and social workers will allow us to truly invest in our future and create jobs for women . And passing the Employee Free Choice Act - which would allow workers to join a union with a single signature - will ultimately lift the incomes of all workers . - DOLORES HUERTA , COFOUNDER , UNITED FARM WORKERS ; PRESIDENT , DOLORES HUERTA FOUNDATION DEAR PRESIDENT OBAMA : I have received so many breathless letters myself and now it 's rolereversal time . You have reawakened a disillusioned and passive electorate and begun healing racial wounds that have crippled us for centuries . I believe , like you do , that America today is not as intolerant and bitterly divided as we are encouraged to be by the mainstream media and the military industrial complex that dictates its messaging . It is my sincere hope that our national discourse will rise to your example and employ more humility and maturity in the political arena . I look forward to working with you . Viva democracia ! - ANI DIFRANCO , SINGER-SONGWRITER BROADEN HEALTH CARE . Create health care systems that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities . It is imperative for our nation 's leaders to make the healdi of women of color a priority . - ELEANOR HINTON HOYTT , PRESIDENT AND CEO , BLACK WOMEN 'S HEALTH IMPERATIVE RE-ROUTE U.S. MONEY . It 'll be a long hard slog for our new president to correct all the ways American policies deepen the marginalization and poverty of women in developing countries . From the boadoads of cash we send to patriarchal , undemocratic regimes such as Saudi Arabia to the trade policies that allow U.S. corporations to exploit the labor of some of the most impoverished women in the world - it 'll take more than the brush of a presidential pen . In the meantime , can we at least not spread sexist dogma with our aid dollars ? Billions in U.S. funding for HIV/AIDS prevention require recipients to preach abstinence and condemn prostitution . It does n't work , it 's dangerous and it should end , straight away . - SONIA SHAH , INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST ; AUTHOR OF THE BODY HUNTERS : TESTING NEW DRUGS ON THE WORLD 'S POOREST PATIENTS AND CRUDE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration alone ca n't do all the things we want it to - it requires a vibrant and effective counterpart in the socialchange sector . As an organizer , Obama understands the kind of support they need to make real and lasting change . - THE EDITORS OF FEMINISTING.COM REMEMBER THE THREE R 'S . Feminists understand that equality for women and girls will be sustained when government makes progressive education a national agenda . As we study and learn together we create community . Making literacy and democratic education available to everyone is the necessary foundation for responsible citizenship . Without education , diverse populations can not communicate across boundaries . - BELL HOOKS , AUTHOR AND DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR IN RESIDENCE , BEREA COLLEGE DO N'T FORGET THE POOR . The most urgent problem facing women and girls here and around the globe is poverty and its dire consequences : poor health , dying young , illiteracy , violence , HIV/AIDS , unwanted pregnancies , dependency , bleak futures . Women continue to be unsafe in their homes , their workplaces , refugee camps and in war-torn spots around the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president 's ear . - BEVERLY GUY-SHEFTALL , FOUNDING DIRECTOR , WOMEN 'S RESEARCH &; RESOURCE CENTER . SPELMAN COLLEGE HALT THE RAIDS . First , Obama should place a moratorium on immigration raids , which are having a terrible impact on Latinas . If they 're not arrested along with their husbands , these women end up under house arrest , relying on local charities to feed themselves and their children . Second , a woman 's right to choose is not up for debate . Punto . - DAISY HERNNDEZ , EDITOR , COLORLINES MAGAZINE
