In July 1942 , just six months after the Japanese bombed the American fleet in Pearl Harbor and overwhelmed the Western powers in Southeast Asia , a number of distinguished Japanese scholars and intellectuals gathered for a conference in Kyoto . Some were literati of the so-called Romantic group ; others were philosophers of the Buddhist/ Hegelian Kyoto school . Their topic of discussion was how to " overcome the modern . " // It was a time of nationalist zeal , and the intellectuals who attended the conference were all nationalists in one way or another ; but oddly enough the war itself , in China , Hawaii , or Southeast Asia , was barely mentioned . At least one of the members , Hayashi Fusao , a former- **33;0;TOOLONG , later wrote that the assault on the West had filled him with jubilation . Even though he was in freezing Manchuria when he heard the news , it felt as though dark clouds had lifted to reveal a clear summer sky . No doubt similar emotions came over many of his colleagues , but war propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , the literary romantics as much as the philosophers , had been interested in overcoming the modern long before the attack on Pearl Harbor . Their conclusions , to the extent that they had enough coherence to be politically useful , lent themselves to propaganda for a new Asian order under Japanese leadership , but the intellectuals would have been horrified to be called propagandists . They were thinkers , not hacks . // " The modern " is in any case a slippery concept , but in Kyoto in 1942 , as in Kabul or Karachi in 2001 , it meant the West . But the West is almost as elusive as the modern . Japanese intellectuals had strong feelings about what they were up against , but had some difficulty defining exactly what that was . Westernization , one opined , was like a disease that had infected the Japanese spirit . The " modern thing , " said another , was a " European thing . " There was much talk about unhealthy specialization in knowledge , which had splintered the wholeness of Oriental spiritual culture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the absorption of modern technology , and individual freedoms , and democracy . All these had to be " overcome . " A leading film critic , Tsumura Hideo , excoriated Hollywood movies and praised the documentary films of Leni Riefenstahl about Nazi rallies , which were more in tune with his ideas on how to forge a healthy national community . In his view , the war against the West was a war against the " poisonous materialist civilization " built on Jewish financial capitalist power . All agreed that culture-that is , traditional Japanese culture-was spiritual and profound , whereas modern Western civilization was shallow , rootless , and destructive of creative power . The West , particularly the United States , was coldly mechanical . A wholistic , traditional , classical Orient , united under divine Japanese imperial rule , would restore the warm organic community to spiritual health . As one of the participants put it , the struggle was between Japanese blood and Western intellect . // The West , to Asians at that time , and to some extent still today , also meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when China was humiliated in the Opium Wars , educated Japanese realized that national survival depended on careful study and emulation of Western ideas and technology . Never had a great nation embarked on such a radical transformation as Japan between the 1850s and 1910s . The main slogan of the Meiji Period ( 1868-1912 ) was " Bunmei Kaika , " or " Civilization and Enlightenment " ; that is , Western civilization and enlightenment . Everything Western , from natural science to literary realism , was hungrily soaked up by Japanese intellectuals . European dress , Prussian constitutional law , British naval strategies , German philosophy , American cinema , French architecture , and much , much more were taken over and adapted . The modern , then , referred to that " European thing , " but also to the Japanese effort to make it their own . // The transformation paid off handsomely . Japan remained uncolonized and quickly became a great power that managed , in 1905 , to defeat Russia in a thoroughly modern war . Japan 's industrial revolution did not come long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impoverished country people moved into the cities , where conditions could be cruel . The army was a brutal refuge for rural young men , and their sisters were sometimes sold to big city brothels . But economic problems aside , there was another reason many Japanese intellectuals sought to undo the wholesale westernization of the late nineteenth century . It was as though Japan suffered from intellectual indigestion . Western civilization had been swallowed too fast . And that is partly why that group of literati gathered in Kyoto to discuss ways of reversing history , overcoming the West , and returning to an idealized spiritual past . //
