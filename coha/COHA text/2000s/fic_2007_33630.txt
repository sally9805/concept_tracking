Chapter One Statistics show that most mortals sell their souls for five reasons : sex , money , power , revenge , and love . In that order . I suppose I should have been reassured , then , that I was out here assisting with numero uno , but the whole situation just made me feel ... well , sleazy . And coming from me , that was something . Maybe I just ca n't empathize anymore , I mused . It 's been too long . When I was a virgin , people still believed swans could impregnate girls . Nearby , Hugh waited patiently for me to overcome my reticence . He stuffed his hands into well-pressed khakis , leaning his large frame against his Lexus . " I do n't see what the big deal is . You do this all the time . " That was n't exactly true , but we both knew what he meant . Ignoring him , I instead made a great show of studying my surroundings , not that that improved my mood . The suburbs always dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many SUVs . Somewhere in the night , a dog refused to stop yapping . " I do n't do this , " I said finally . " Even I have standards . " Hugh snorted , expressing his opinion of my standards . " Okay , if it makes you feel better , do n't think of this in terms of damnation . Think of it as a charity case . " " A charity case ? " " Sure . " He pulled out his Pocket PC , looking briskly businesslike , despite the unorthodox setting . Not that I should have been surprised . Hugh was a professional imp , a master at getting mortals to sell their souls , an expert in contracts and legal loopholes that would have made any lawyer wince in envy . He was also my friend . It sort of gave new meaning to the With friends like these ... adage . " Listen to these stats , " he continued . " Martin Miller . Male , of course . Caucasian . Nonpracticing Lutheran . Works over at a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ' house . " " Jesus . " " Told you . " " Charity or no , it still seems so ... extreme . How old is he again ? " " Thirty-four . " " Ew . " " Exactly . If you were that old and had n't gotten any , you might seek desperate measures too . " He glanced down at his watch . " So are you going to do this or not ? " No doubt I was keeping Hugh from a date with some hot woman half his age-by which I meant , of course , the age Hugh looked . In reality , he was pushing a century . I set my purse on the ground and gave him a warning glance . " You owe me . " " I do , " he conceded . This was n't my usual gig , thank goodness . The imp normally " outsourced " this kind of thing but had run into some kind of scheduling problem tonight . I could n't imagine who he normally got to do this . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Georgina ? " " Yeah ? " " There 's ... one other thing ... " I turned back around , not liking the tone in his voice . " Yes ? " " He , um , sort of had a special request . " I raised an eyebrow and waited . " You see , uh , he 's really into the whole , like , evil thing . You know , figures if he sold his soul to the devil-so to speak-then he should lose his virginity to a , I do n't know , demoness or something . " I swear , even the dog stopped barking at that . " You 're joking . " Hugh did n't respond . " I 'm not a-no . No way am I going to- " " Come on , Georgina . It 's nothing . A flourish . Smoke and mirrors . Please ? Just do this for me ? " He turned wistful , cajoling . Hard to resist . Like I said , he was good at his job . " I 'm really in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ... it would mean so much ... " I groaned , unable to refuse the pathetic look on his broad face . " If anyone finds out about this- " " My lips are sealed . " He actually had the audacity to make a sealing motion . Bending down , resigned , I unfastened the straps on my shoes . " What are you doing ? " he asked . " These are my favorite Bruno Maglis . I do n't want them absorbed when I change . " " Yeah , but ... you can just shape-shift them back . " " They wo n't be the same . " " They will . You can make them anything you want . This is just silly . " " Look , " I demanded , " do you want to stand out here arguing shoes , or do you want me to go make a man of your virgin ? " Hugh clamped his mouth shut and gestured toward the house . I padded away in the grass , the blades tickling my bare feet . The back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh had promised . I let myself into the sleeping house , hoping they did n't have a dog , blearily wondering how I 'd reached this low point in my existence . Adjusting to the darkness , my eyes soon discerned the features of a comfortable , middle-class family room : sofa , television , bookshelves . A stairwell rose to the left , and a hallway veered to the right . I turned down the hall , letting my appearance shape-shift as I walked . The sensation was so familiar , so second nature to me , that I did n't even need to see my exterior to know what was happening . My petite frame grew taller , the slim build still staying slim but taking on a leaner , harder edge . My skin paled to death white , leaving no memory of its faint tan . The hair , already to my midback , stayed the same length but darkened to jet black , the fine waviness turning straight and coarse . My breasts-impressive by most standards-became larger still , rivaling those of the comic book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my outfit ... well , away went the cute Banana Republic slacks and blouse . Thigh-high black leather boots appeared on my legs , paired with a matching halter top and a skirt I never could have bent over in . Spiky wings , horns , and a whip completed the package . " Oh Lord , " I muttered , accidentally taking in the whole effect in a small decorative mirror . I hoped none of the local demonesses ever found about this . They were really quite classy . Turning from the taunting mirror , I stared down the hall at my destination : a closed door with a yellow MEN AT WORK sign attached to it . I thought I could hear the faint sounds of a video game bleeping from beyond , though such noises silenced immediately when I knocked . A moment later , the door opened , and I stood facing a five-foot-eight guy with shoulder-length , dirty blond hair rapidly receding on top . A large , hairy belly peeped out from underneath his Homer Simpson T-shirt , and he held a bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor when he saw me . " Martin Miller ? " " Y-yes , " he gasped out . I cracked the whip . " You ready to play with me ? " Exactly six minutes later , I left the Miller residence . Apparently thirty-four years does n't do much for one 's stamina . " Whoa , that was fast , " Hugh noted , seeing me walk across the front yard . He was leaning against the car again , smoking a cigarette . " No shit . Got another one of those ? " He grinned and handed over his own cigarette , giving me a once-over . " Would you be offended if I said the wings kind of get me hot ? " I took the cigarette , narrowing my eyes at him as I inhaled . A quick check ascertained no one else was around , and I shape-shifted back to my usual form . " You owe me big , " I reminded him , putting the shoes back on . " I know . Of course , some might argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Better than you 're used to . " I could n't deny that , but I did n't have to feel good about it either . Poor Martin . Geek or no , committing his soul to eternal damnation was a helluva price to pay for six minutes . " You wan na get a drink ? " Hugh offered . " No , it 's too late . I 'm going home . Got a book to read . " " Ah , of course . When 's the big day ? " " Tomorrow , " I proclaimed . The imp chuckled at my hero worship . " He just writes mainstream fiction , you know . He 's hardly Nietzsche or Thoreau . " " Hey , one does n't have to be surreal or transcendental to be a great writer . I should know ; I 've seen a few over the years . " Hugh grunted at my imperious air , giving me a mock bow . " Far be it from me to argue with a lady about her age . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked two blocks to where I had parked . I was unlocking the car door when I felt it : the warm , tingling feeling indicative of another immortal nearby . Vampire , I registered , only a millisecond before he appeared beside me . Damn , they moved fast . " Georgina , my belle , my sweet succubus , my goddess of delight , " he intoned , placing his hands over his heart dramatically . Great . Just what I needed . Duane was quite possibly the most obnoxious immortal I 'd ever met . He kept his blond hair shaved to a close buzz , and as usual , he demonstrated terrible taste in both fashion and deodorant . " Go away , Duane . I have nothing to say to you . " " Oh come on , " he crooned , his hand snaking out to hold the door as I tried to open it . " Even you ca n't play coy this time . Look at you . You 're positively glowing . Good hunting , eh ? " I scowled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wreathing me . Obstinately , I tried to pry my door open against Duane 's hold . No luck . " He 'll be out for days , from the looks of it , " the vampire added , peering at me closely . " Still , I imagine whoever he was enjoyed the ride-both on you and to hell . " He gave me a lazy smile , just barely revealing his pointed teeth . " He must have been someone pretty good for you to look as hot as you do now . What happened ? I thought you only fucked the scum of the earth . The real assholes . " " Change of policy . I did n't want to give you false hope . " He shook his head appreciatively . " Oh Georgina , you never disappoint-you and your witticisms . But then , I 've always found whores know how to make good use of their mouths , on or off the job . " " Let go , " I snapped , tugging harder at the door . " Why the hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imp were doing over here . The Eastside is my turf . " " We do n't have to abide by your ' turf ' rules , and you know it . " " Still , common courtesy dictates when you 're in the neighborhood-literally , in this case-you at least say hello . Besides , how come we never hang out ? You owe me some quality time . You spend enough time with those other losers . " The losers he referred to were my friends and the only decent vampires I 'd ever met . Most vampires-like Duane-were arrogant , devoid of social skills , and obsessed with territoriality . Not unlike a lot of mortal men I 'd met . " If you do n't let me go , you 're going to learn a whole new definition of ' common courtesy . ' " Okay , it was a stupid , faux action-movie line , but it was the best I could come up with on the spot . I made my voice sound as menacing as possible , but it was pure bravado , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shape-shifting ; vampires had super strength and speed . What this meant was that one of us mingled better at parties , and the other could break a man 's wrist with a handshake . " Are you actually threatening me ? " He ran a playful hand along my cheek , making the hairs on my neck stand on end-in a bad way . I squirmed . " That 's adorable . And kind of arousing . I actually think I 'd like to see you on the offensive . Maybe if you 'd just behave like a good girl-ow ! You little bitch ! " With both of his hands occupied , I had seized my window of opportunity . A quick burst of shape-shifting , and sharp , three-inch claws appeared on my right hand . I swiped them across his cheek . His superior reflexes did n't let me get very far with the gesture , but I did draw blood before he gripped my wrist and slammed it against the car . " What 's the matter ? Not offensive enough for you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cute , Georgina . Very cute . We 'll see how cute you are by the time I- " Headlights glimmered in the night as a car turned the corner on the next block and headed toward us . In that split second , I could see the indecision on Duane 's face . Our tte -- tte would undoubtedly be noticed by the driver . While Duane could easily kill an intervening mortal-hell , it was what he did for a living-having the kill linked to his harassment of me would not look good to our superiors . Even an asshole like Duane would think twice before stirring up that kind of paperwork . " We are n't finished , " he hissed , releasing my wrist . " Oh , I think we are . " I could feel braver now that salvation was on the way . " The next time you come near me 's going to be the last . " " I 'm quaking in terror , " he simpered . His eyes gleamed once in the darkness , and then he was gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . Thank God for whatever liaison or ice cream run had pulled that driver out tonight . Not wasting any more time , I got into my car and drove off , anxious to be back in the city . I tried to ignore the shaking of my hands on the wheel , but the truth of the matter was , Duane terrified me . I had told him off plenty of times in the presence of my immortal friends , but taking him on alone on a dark street was an entirely different matter , especially since all my threats had been empty ones . I actually abhorred violence in all its forms . I suppose this came from living through periods of history fraught with levels of cruelty and brutality no one in the modern world could even comprehend . People like to say we live in violent times now , but they have no idea . Sure , there had been a certain satisfaction centuries ago in seeing a rapist castrated swiftly and promptly for his crimes , without endless courtroom drama or an early release for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in revenge and vigilantism rarely know where to draw the line , so I 'd take the bureaucracy of the modern judicial system any day . Thinking back to how I 'd presumed the fortuitous driver was on an ice cream run , I decided a little dessert would do me some good too . Once I was safely back in Seattle , I stopped in a 24-hour grocery store , discovering some marketing mastermind had created tiramisu-flavored ice cream . Tiramisu and ice cream . The ingenuity of mortals never failed to amaze me . As I was about to pay , I passed a display of flowers . They were cheap and a little tattered , but I watched as a young man came in and nervously scanned them over . At last he selected some autumn-colored mums and carried them off . My eyes followed him wistfully , half-jealous of whatever girl would be getting those . As Duane had noted , I usually fed off losers , guys I did n't have to feel guilty about hurting or rendering unconscious for a few days . Those kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether . As for the guys who did send flowers , well , I avoided them . For their own good . That was out of character for a succubus , but I was too jaded to care about propriety anymore . Feeling sad and lonely , I picked up a bouquet of red carnations for myself and paid for it and the ice cream . When I arrived home , my phone was ringing . Setting down my goods , I glanced at the Caller-ID . Caller unknown . " My lord and master , " I answered . " What a perfect ending to a perfect night . " " Save your quips , Georgie . Why were you fucking with Duane ? " " Jerome , I-what ? " " He just called . Said you were unduly hassling him . " " Hassling ? Him ? " Outrage surged inside me . " He started it ! He came up to me and- " " Did you hit him ? " " I ... " " Did you ? " I sighed . Jerome was the archdemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my supervisor . It was his job to manage all of us , make sure we did our duties , and keep us in line . Like any lazy demon , however , he preferred we create as little work for him as possible . His annoyance was almost palpable through the phone line . " I did sort of hit him . Actually , it was more of a swipe . " " I see . A swipe . And did you threaten him too ? " " Well , yes , I guess , if you want to argue semantics , but Jerome , come on ! He 's a vampire . I ca n't touch him . You know that . " The archdemon hesitated , apparently considering the outcome of me going head-to-head with Duane . I must have lost in the hypothetical battle because I heard Jerome exhale a moment later . " Yes . I suppose . But do n't provoke him anymore . I 've got enough to work on right now without you children having catfights . " " Since again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small talk . I hung up , feeling highly offended . I could n't believe Duane had tattled on me and then made me out to be the bad guy . Worse , Jerome seemed to have believed it . At least at first . That probably hurt me most of all because , my slacker-succubus habits aside , I 'd always enjoyed a kind of indulgent , teacher 's pet role with the archdemon. (
