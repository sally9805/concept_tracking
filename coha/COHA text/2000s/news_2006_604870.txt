<p> Old soldiers do n't always fade away . Sometimes they return to active duty . <p> Take Lt. Col. Joe Repya . The leading edge of the baby boom , he 'll turn 60 on Thursday . He 's pushing himself to keep up with soldiers one-third his age in the Army 's 101st Airborne Division . <p> " I discovered very quickly that I ca n't run 4 miles as fast as some of these kids , " says Repya , who was in Iraq last year and is at Fort Campbell , Ky. , awaiting his return to Iraq . " As long as I can see them on the horizon as they 're finishing , I 'm doing pretty good . It 's a tremendously good feeling to help motivate these young soldiers . " <p> Repya of Eagan , Minn. , is n't the only soldier showing more than a bit of gray . <p> Of the 157,000 troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan , more than 1,700 are older than 55 , according to Lt. Col. Ellen Krenke , a Pentagon spokeswoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve troops , who make up about 19% of those fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan . Those citizen soldiers skew older than those on active duty . <p> In all , 1,603 of the older troops are from the Guard and Reserve , according to the Pentagon . Few came from such units during the Vietnam War . But the Pentagon shifted large numbers of critical support jobs to the Guard and Reserves after Vietnam , making it difficult to go to war without part-time troops . <p> Assets and liabilities <p> David Segal , a military sociologist at the University of Maryland , says the 1,700 older warriors might be a record for modern U.S. wars . <p> " Fifty-five-year-olds can keep themselves in good shape if they 're committed to it , " Segal says . " You 've got a maturity and experience , which can be very useful . But there are also liabilities . You have to monitor their health and fitness . " <p> Often baby boomer warriors are doctors , chaplains and civil affairs officers . In those specialties , age and decades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old warrior in a combat zone : diminished physical ability . <p> " Given the nature of this war , once you land there , any situation you get into can be dangerous , " Segal says . <p> Only 121 of the older troops are , like Repya , from active-duty units where their combat experience is valued . Repya recalls telling his wife , Debra , on the evening of Sept. 11 , 2001 , that he wanted to write the Army and volunteer to fight . <p> " She said , ' You do that . We 're behind you 100% . ' I could n't have done it without her , " Repya says . " None of us could come back without the love and support of our families . " <p> Repya , who once owned a firm that bought and sold airplanes , says it was n't a financial hardship . <p> He 'd first joined the Army in 1969 and commanded a rifle platoon in Vietnam . He left active duty in 1979 and spent the next five years in the Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserves . He retired in January 1998 after 28 years of service . Sandwiched in that time were seven months of active duty in 1990 and 1991 for Desert Storm with the 1st Infantry Division . <p> Repya rejoined on Oct. 1 , 2004 . While training , he took a spill during a nighttime exercise that severed a tendon in his right bicep and tore the rotator cuff . <p> He toughed it out and headed to Iraq in June 2005 . He led an advance team to prepare for the arrival of soldiers from the 101st . He was in Iraq from June to November . The pain in his arm , worsened by the weight of body armor , became so severe that he was shipped home for surgery and recovery . <p> He 'll return in May . The soldiers , he says , find comfort in an officer with combat experience that dates to 1970 . <p> " The younger soldiers , especially the enlisted soldiers , realize that you 're a grandfather , days away from turning 60 , and that you volunteered to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain extent they look at me as a father figure . " <p> They rib him , too . During a promotion ceremony , he remarked that he 'd made captain in 1973 . " For crying out loud , " a newly minted captain blurted out . " I was n't even born then . " <p> ' No spring chicken ' <p> Robert Goulka , 57 , " no spring chicken , " by his own admission , returned last year from Iraq a decorated war veteran after a year of active duty . <p> " Was I as nimble as I was 20 years ago ? No , " Lt. Col. Goulka says . <p> Goulka 's road to Iraq began in 1971 . He enlisted , trained in artillery and found he liked the Army . He was a legal clerk in West Germany . He joined the Army Reserve in 1976 and has served ever since . <p> Goulka 's regular job is with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in New York City . He ensures that department programs comply with environmental laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while on active duty because of tax breaks for troops . <p> He was called up to active duty in 2004 . As a civil affairs officer in Iraq , Goulka says , he helped care for civilians and advised commanders on avoiding sensitive sites such as mosques and archaeological areas . <p> Before shipping out to Iraq , he trained at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin , and Fort Bragg , N.C.  --  then on to Kuwait and Iraq . There , his unit helped set up Iraqi elections and prepared camps for refugees . He was awarded the Bronze Star for his work in helping to revamp a multimillion-dollar grant program for reconstruction . <p> There were anxious moments . Among them : Driving the dangerous road to the Baghdad airport , which is notorious for ambushes . <p> " I expected to get hit any time , " he says . " I gripped the steering wheel so hard I lost feeling in my hands . " <p> For the most part , Goulka says , age worked in his favor . Working with generals did n't unnerve him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , whatever it is , " he says . " Age gives you a little perspective about life and people . " <p> The Rev. Philip Mahalic , 58 , hopes he can provide a little perspective for soldiers . <p> The Roman Catholic pastor of Sorrowful Mother Parish in Wheatfield , Ind. , about 60 miles southeast of Chicago , has been saying Mass and counseling troops in Kuwait and Iraq . <p> The military chaplain , in an e-mail from Iraq , says he brings to the troops " the wisdom that comes with time and the experience of life that can only be derived from living . " <p> He did n't want to go to war , he says . " I simply look at what needs to be done , what is the right thing to do , what I feel God is calling me to do , and then I go ahead and do that thing . " <p> He does n't hear many complaints , Col. Mahalic says . <p> " They have difficulties in leaving , in many cases , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer , " Mahalic says . " It is very hard for them , but they seem to take these sacrifices that they are making in stride . " <p> Repya , who has two daughters and one granddaughter , says he understands how hard it can be for military families . By serving in Iraq , he figures he 's giving a younger colleague a break . <p> His fellow soldiers believe that they 're winning the war , he says , and he 's eager to rejoin them . <p> " A lot of young officers tell me that guys like myself willing to take a tour may mean they or one of their friends wo n't have to , " he says . " It 's tremendous to me that they have faith in me . " PHOTOS , Color , Repya family photo ( 2 )
