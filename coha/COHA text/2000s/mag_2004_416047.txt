Ever heard of skier 's thumb ? Until you asked , this physician always figured it was the hand signal used by skiers hitchhiking to and from their down-valley hovels . Turns out , skier 's thumb is an injury of the ulnar collateral ligamentthe one on the inner side of the digit that holds the bones together at the metacarpophalangeal joint . It accounts for 8 to 10 percent of all skiing injuries , and for good reason : When you fall with a ski pole in your grip , the implement acts as a fulcrum that can cause the ligament to stretch or tear . Should this happen , you 'll suffer pain at the base of the thumb , topped off by swelling , black-and-blue discoloration , and weakness of grasp . If you tear the ligament completely , plan on surgery and four months ' rehab . Partial tears can require four to six weeks of immobilization in a cast . Interestingly , skier 's thumb wasand still could be , for all we knowa chronic ailment among Scottish gamekeepers , who thrashed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ski boom served up many more such caseshence , " skier 's thumb . " But Flake hopes the medical establishment will rethink the injury 's nomenclature and offically name it , " **46;2752;TOOLONG ' thumb . " What 's with the French ? They 're more than just bony-nosed prigs who hate George W and look like John Kerrythat 's what . The French , for all their haughtiness , pioneered extreme skiing in the ' ' 80s , and , a few years later , the Dead French Extremists Club . In fact , it seems the French are eager to take on the challenge of just about any extreme sport , unless it involves self-defense from fascist dictatorsor tipping . Yes , they 're arrogant on the mountain , but we 'd be high-minded , too , if we had the Alps in our backyard and our citizens dominated the freeskiing circuit ( seven Frenchmen finished among the top 15 in the International Freeskiers Association 's World Tour standings last year , taking three of the top four spots ) . So , despite the large-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better steep-skiers than we are . But that 's not important : Most French prefer to ski on their side of the pond . Meanwhile , there 's a far stranger species creeping into U.S. ski resortsthe Australian . Are splittails more show than go ? Save for the Hexcel Split Tail , circa the ' ' 70s , splittail technology is just now breaking out . The most dramatic such ski , Salomon 's AK Rocket Swallowtail has generated tons of buzz . Salomon claims the following : A 13.5-centimeter-long V-cutjust behind the effective edgeallows this 195-centimeter board to feel like a 185 . The length makes for stable straight-lining and landings ; the missing " V ' means the ski is lighter and nimbler than a nonsplit 195 . A swallowtail also sinks a bit in powder , so you can take a more forward stance in big-mountain conditions , rather than leaning back to lift the tips . Dynastar employs a smaller swallowtail ( basically , an inch-deep notch ) on the back of its Intuitiv Big ; it also aims to provide rear-end sinkage in deep stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from any other ski , " says pro skier Shane McConkey ( who has a nonsplit signature model ) . Mmm , but they look mighty bitchin ' ' . Big Mountain freeskiing events : Spectator sport or clown show ? If we 're lucky , both . Flake finds freeskiing events the most watchable of skiing competitions , what with ballsy athletes choosing their own lines through a mountain 's natural terrain features . Scoring is based on five categories : line choice , control , fluidity , technique , and aggression . Better yet , free-skiers compete in normal ski clothes instead of creepy skin suits that make spectators feel like perverts . As for the clown-show element , freeskiing has recently undergone a decrease in the testosterone-fueled , human-lawn-dart approach . " We 're not impressed by Hollywood air or reckless riding anymore , " says Dino Raiffault , head judge of the Verbier Ride 2004 event . ( Not that big jumps are discouraged , but competitors better stickand ski away fromtheir landings . ) Still , do n't expect to see them on primetime TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer at Sports Illustrated , lives with track and field " in a cable ghetto where only the truly devoted will venture in search of entertainment .
