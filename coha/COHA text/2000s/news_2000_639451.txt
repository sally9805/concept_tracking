<p> It 's seven weeks until Colorado 's presidential primary . Do you know who you 're supporting ? <p> Colorado 's business community does . <p> Local business leaders are picking sides , and they 're backing their choices with $ 1,000 and $ 2,000 checks . And sometimes a lot more . <p> The Anschutz Corp. , headed by **31;29;TOOLONG mogul Philip Anschutz , gave $ 100,000 last year to the Republican National Committee . Meanwhile , local lawyer and rainmaker Norm Brownstein headed a fund-raiser for Al Gore in June that raked in tens of thousands of dollars . <p> Federal filings show that Coloradans contributed $ 1.4 million to presidential campaigns through the third quarter of 1999 , the most recent reporting period available . Republican George Bush , whose campaign bankroll nationally tops $ 57 million , led the Colorado list with nearly $ 600,000 . <p> Gore , with more than $ 24 million nationally , has raised at least $ 400,000 in the state . <p> The biggest surprise comes from conservative activist and GOP candidate Gary Bauer . He lags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top five fund-raising states , with $ 109,917 , thanks to a strong base of support in Colorado Springs . <p> The Iowa caucuses are Monday , followed by the bellwether New Hampshire primary Feb. 1 . <p> The Colorado primary on March 10 , a Friday , appears to be a speed bump between two Super Tuesdays . On March 7 , voters in 15 states , including delegate-rich California and New York , go to the polls . On March 14 , Florida and Texas are among six states holding primaries . <p> On the whole , Colorado may not be as important in selecting party candidates as in helping them finance their campaigns elsewhere . <p> " In Colorado , the dollar race is disconnected from the vote race , " said Eric Sondermann , a Denver-based political consultant unaffiliated with any presidential campaign . " Denver has become an important stop on the tour . And they 're not raising money in Colorado necessarily to spend money in Colorado . " <p> Business executives in the state gave reasons ranging from the ideological to the personal as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect Bill Bradley 's intelligence and integrity , " said Democratic activist Steve Leatherman , president of Denver venture capital firm Quest International Management Co . Leatherman said Bradley exhibits " very good depth of knowledge of business affairs , especially international commerce . " But a bigger factor is Gore 's ties to Bill Clinton . <p> " I 've got Clinton fatigue , " Leatherman said . <p> By law , individual contributions to presidential candidates are limited to $ 1,000 per primary and general election campaign . However , spouses , family members and employees of a particular contributor sometimes sign a check , as well . In addition , contributors can give an additional $ 1,000 in so-called " compliance funds " to pay for a variety of fund-raising expenses . <p> A key factor in determining presidential preferences for some executives is the balance between social and economic concerns . <p> " I 'm socially liberal and financially conservative , " said a Denver real estate developer who asked to remain anonymous , seeing no benefit in being identified with one particular candidate . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at how a candidate 's economic policies will affect my business , " the developer said . " But at the end of the day , if we do n't have social tranquillity in the country , it really does n't make much difference if we have a tax rate of 34 percent or 37 percent . " The business executive , who made donations to both the Gore and Bradley campaigns , said it 's possible he 'd support a Republican if the candidate gained his approval on some social issues . <p> Financing both sides of a race is a tried-and-tested method of paying tribute without alienating a potential office holder . <p> Charlie Ergen , chairman of EchoStar Communications Corp. , wrote $ 1,000 checks to both McCain and Gore . So did Ergen 's wife , Cantey . <p> Both McCain and Gore have championed the satellite-TV issues integral to EchoStar 's business . In addition , Ergen hosted a fund-raiser last year at his house for McCain that raised thousands of dollars more , some of it from other EchoStar executives . <p> McCain has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West chairman and CEO Sol Trujillo . Not only is Trujillo on McCain 's national finance committee , but U S West 's political action committee has donated more than $ 107,000 to political campaigns run by the Arizona senator over the course of his career . <p> Norm Brownstein , a prolific fund-raiser , has known Gore for 18 years , and McCain for 15 years . He contributed $ 1,000 to McCain , and $ 2,000 to Gore , for whom he remains a key fund-raiser , just as he was for the Clinton/Gore tickets in 1992 and 1996 . <p> " I 'm very supportive of Al , " said Brownstein said . <p> Doug Jones , chairman of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce , is supporting Bush less for his economic policies than for his style and personality . <p> " I had the opportunity to have lunch with him and I was so impressed by his charisma and his ability to be inclusive , " Jones said . " I live in Denver , and if you 're a Republican living in Denver , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , Jones said he does n't perceive major differences among Bush , McCain or the other Republicans trailing the field . <p> " They 're all talking about tax relief , " he said , " but Bush is talking about it more . " Denver 's sports elite is well represented in campaign fund raising . <p> Broncos running back Terrell Davis is playing both sides of the field with $ 1,000 contributions to Gore and McCain . <p> John Beake , vice president of administration for the Broncos , shows up on the Gore campaign 's third-quarter disclosure report with a $ 1,000 donation . <p> The Colorado Rockies ownership is pitching its financial support to Bush . Co-owners Jerry McMorris , Charlie Monfort and Dick Monfort each have made $ 1,000 contributions to the campaign . <p> Also donating to Bush are ski-industry executives Harry Mosgrove , president of Copper Mountain , and Avon-based consultant Jerry Jones . <p> Vail Resorts CEO Adam Aron is listed as a $ 1,000 contributor to Gore . <p> " I have never seen an economy in my lifetime that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , adding that credit should be shared among business , labor and political sectors . <p> " Much of that credit goes to President Clinton and Vice President Gore , " he said . " I think the current administration has performed admirably and deserves a chance to continue . " While some executives have chosen sides , Denver homebuilder George " Geoie " Writer Jr . represents the undecided contingent . <p> Writer , chairman and chief executive of the Writer Corp. , has family ties to Arizona Sen. John McCain . The grandfathers of Writer and McCain served together as admirals in the U.S. Navy , and Writer 's mother went to school with McCain 's father in southern California . <p> " I 'm very interested in his candidacy , but I 'm not necessarily backing him yet , " said Writer , adding that his $ 500 contribution to the McCain campaign was more a gesture of respect than an endorsement . <p> Writer describes himself as a moderate Republican who has voted occasionally for Democrats in state and local races , but always for Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradley some of the same personal qualities that he admires in McCain . He said economic platforms are not as important to him as character traits . <p> " Integrity and judgment are the two most important factors to me , " he said . " I see those characteristics in Bradley and McCain . The fact that Bradley 's more of a liberal than I am does n't mean I do n't have enormous respect for him . " <p> Writer said he has n't made a decision yet on a candidate . But he 's already bracing himself against possible criticism from his more partisan Republican colleagues if he votes Democratic in the general election . <p> " I 'll probably get my fanny kicked by my party on this , " he said , " but the guy who steps out and really shows me some leadership and credibility is going to get my vote .
