When TV newswoman Greta Van Susteren had an eyelift last year , a media firestorm followed . Here , in a Bazaar exclusive , she reveals the truth behind the headlines and the reason she has no regrets // How you look is your business and nobody else 's . Your looks and your life are not a democracy-not everybody gets a vote . Make your appearance and your choices a totalitarian regime-you are the boss . Let me try not to put too fine a point on it : I have worked hard in my life . I worked hard in college and law school , got several degrees , worked at practicing law , worked at building a successful law firm . Then I started a second career as a television news analyst and I worked hard at that too . People thought I was pretty smart-or at least educated . Then one day I had plastic surgery , and I became a bimbo to some . In December 2001 I decided to leave CNN and join the Fox network . So for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . I had a whole month where I did n't have to get dressed up , act like a grown-up and try to sound smart . I could stay up till all hours watching movies and reading books . I did not have to worry about clients going to prison for life , or reporting the facts correctly on television , or getting the story first . The first Sunday after CNN , I was reading The New York Times in my bathrobe and drinking coffee with my husband , John . That morning I 'd caught a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror . Hey , what happened to that 16-year-old ? I took a closer look and discovered bags under my eyes . Huh ? Me , bags ? Must be a mistake . I took a closer look . Sure enough , there it was : The ordinary wear and tear that comes with age . Hmmm , how about getting rid of those bags under my eyes ? It was , I must emphasize , a whim . I brought the subject up with John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes ? " " What bags ? " ( Right answer ! ) " These . " " Honey , you are beautiful to me . Anything you want to do is fine , " he said . ( Again , right answer . He was two for two . ) " But what do you think ? " " Whatever you want . " ( Now I was a bit annoyed , as I wanted some advice . ) " I 'm serious-what do you think ? " " Ask your sister . " ( A dodge , I think , but a safe response nonetheless . ) Through my sister , who is a doctor , I found a plastic surgeon in Washington D.C.. He explained to me during the exam that I actually did n't have bags under my eyes , although that was the way it appeared to me . What I had , he told me , came with age . He recommended doing a very limited procedure-an eye tuck-and warned me that when it was all over , I might not notice that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done later . It would be an outpatient procedure , and there would be a bit of swelling for three weeks . Basically , no big deal . He said he could do it the day after next . I did a quick mental calculation . I was due on the air at Fox in three weeks and three days . This will work , I thought . It 'd be an outpatient procedure , so the swelling could n't be that bad . ( In my lexicon , the word outpatient translates to " no big deal and you live . " ) The day of the surgery I bounced into the doctor 's office as if I was having my teeth cleaned . They said I 'd need a ride home , so John waited ... and waited ... and waited . A few hours later , out I came from surgery and recovery . I remember nothing . I was drugged and dazed . John took me home , but I recall very little about the ride . The next day , yes , I looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My debut on Fox was scheduled for February 4 . Well , the weeks went by . Each morning I awoke , looked in the mirror and asked myself , When is this swelling going down ? I have a drop-dead day , a national TV launch date . I 'd wake up , look in the mirror and realize I still looked like the Pillsbury Doughboy . The day between the meeting with the surgeon in his office and the actual plastic surgery , I mentioned to Fox News chairman Roger Ailes that I was having the surgery . For everybody who would later say that Roger Ailes had pressured me or wanted me more " glamorous , " here 's the truth : Roger told me there would be swelling ! Roger is a TV guy who has been dealing with talent for years . He knew a lot more about plastic surgery than I did . And of course I did n't listen , since I had no idea what swelling really was . He said he just wanted to warn me . He had hired me based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he offered me my own show , and he was neither expecting nor desiring anything else . I promised him I 'd be ready for the launch of the show , that the surgery would n't interfere . I was determined to keep my word . I had one major flaw in my thinking as I calculated the three weeks of anticipated swelling . I never thought about-and this is really stupid for someone who has been in television for almost 10 years-the fact that I needed to shoot promos before the launch of the show . I would have to be ready for prime time , at the latest , two weeks after my surgery . It was then that I realized that I 'd really stepped into it this time . I had not and did not intend to hide my plastic surgery . After all , the whole point of doing it was to look different . Well . The last week in January I headed to New York to do some promotional television spots for the new show . " I 'm still a little swollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , I walked into Roger 's office at the Fox building . He took one look at me and said , " Do you want me to delay the show ? If you want , I 'll delay the launch . " Okay , so I looked pretty bad . You ca n't keep ice cubes in your pocket all the time . Now I really was looking at myself in the mirror every hour , hoping that the swelling had miraculously gone down . But each time I looked , I seemed more swollen . " No , " I said . " I 'll look a little funny for a while , but the viewers can get beyond it . I promised I was showing up for work , and here I am . " After all , I was about to launch a show based on issues and debate , using all my years of legal expertise and training , right ? So what if I was a little puffy ? I was hired to do a news talk show , not a beauty-tips show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with the plastic surgery happened . I asked the advice of a few friends and colleagues , including Elaine Lafferty , my co-author on my book from which this essay is excerpted , who at the time was covering the war in Afghanistan . " So I think I 'm going to have to go public and talk about the plastic surgery , " I said . " Oh , Greta , just shut up about it , " Elaine rasped over the satellite phone from Kabul . " Do n't say anything . Nobody will notice or care . " She must be right , I figured . Why would anyone have any interest in what I might do to my face ? ( Remember that Elaine was in a war zone , where a little puffiness under the eyes was , shall we say , the least of her worries . ) Well , the day after my first promo aired , the New York Daily News bannered my new mug across the top of its front page under the headline " Foxy Babe . " I confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of amused at how I 'd gotten myself into this mess . I guess idle time can produce curious results . The headlines were followed by cartoons . My favorite was the CBS Eye logo all dressed up and some remark about me starting a trend . I had done something on a whim , and suddenly I had become the poster child for plastic surgery . The media avalanche had begun . Two weeks later I was on the cover of People magazine . So much for those journalistic instincts of my colleagues in the business . Everybody had an opinion . " Fox hired a tomboy , and they got a babe . It 's all everybody was talking about , " Michele Greppi , national editor of Electronic Media , told People . Some people insisted that I had had more than my eyes done . " Nobody looks so different from eyelid surgery alone , " declared Dr. Pamela Lipkin , a New York City plastic surgeon . This stunning development in the history of the Western world also provided a wonderful opportunity for everyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought she looked like a senior version of Kiefer Sutherland , " Cindy Adams wrote in a column completely devoted to my face . " Understand , we are not talking Jennifer Lopez here . She 's not fall-down , drop-dead , fabulous , sexy , to die . Not like Britney Spears has to worry . But she looks nice . I mean , the better to interrupt everybody . " Or how 's this from Robin Gerber in USA Today , in a piece headlined " Why Turn Brilliant Lawyer into Barbie with Brains ? " : " Van Susteren had been physically transformed to approximate the idealized woman that Fox viewers expect . She looked anything but courageous . Van Susteren is a reminder of the minimalization of American women by American culture . " The fact is that I did not set out to make a big stand on cosmetic surgery . I was n't taking an official position on behalf of American women one way or the other . I never intended to speak out in favor of or against plastic surgery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty in America . While some have called me " brave " and " courageous " for being up-front about it , having plastic surgery is a far cry from either of those things . Frankly , I think Katie Couric is brave and courageous for taking on the topic of colon cancer . I have never met her , but I admire her because her goal was to save lives , and I believe she has . I just stumbled onto the plastic-surgery scene , and I certainly did n't do it to make it easier for others . If it did , and if others feel better about themselves after they 've done it , then sure , I 'm pleased . But , in all candor , that was an accident . I had eye surgery because I wanted to . Nobody told me to . I did n't think I was ugly , and I certainly was n't insecure about the way I looked . I did it because I felt it would help me look better , and I wanted to look better for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about my surgery . One reporter for a major media outlet asked if I thought the surgery would affect my credibility . Huh ? Because I was candid and did n't hide it , I now have a credibility issue ? I politely answered that the plastic surgeon had merely fixed my eyes , not removed brain matter or deleted my education or my news experience . An editor commented that she thought I had " sold out the sisterhood , " as if cosmetic surgery somehow made me not a feminist or a supporter of women 's rights . That is ridiculous . The women 's movement is supposed to be about choice and freedom , the right to make your own decisions . I certainly would n't tell someone to have cosmetic work , and I would have been horrified if anyone had told me to . Though sometimes I think my unkempt hair distinguished me more to viewers than anything else , I have made my own choices about my appearance , and anybody who thinks otherwise has obviously never listened to me for five minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a greenroom with Patricia Ireland , past president of the National Organization for Women NOW . A lot of reporters had called NOW for comment right after the surgery , but they always declined to say anything . I wondered about that , because I suspected there were some angry feminists ready to pounce on me . " So , Patricia , " I asked her , " How come you and NOW gave me a pass on the eye surgery ? " I loved her answer . " Well , Greta , you had a track record . " I did have a track record , in the courtroom , in the classroom , and on television . And that is how anybody , male or female , should be judged : by what you do , how you live , who you are . It is that simple .
