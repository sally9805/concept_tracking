<p>  --  As she stepped to the first tee at Kingsmill 's River Course Thursday , Paula Creamer 's preference for all things pink included : a warmup jacket , an ankle bracelet , socks , ponytail holder , driver-head cover , golf bag , grips on her irons and a shaft on her driver . Then again , Creamer also would like to see a bit more red in her life these heady days , specifically those red under-par numbers for birdies and eagles posted on scoreboards all around the LPGA Tour . <p> Creamer , last year 's runaway rookie of the year with two LPGA victories and $1.53 million in earnings , went off Thursday in the Michelob Ultra Championship in pursuit of her first title in what so far has been a somewhat frustrating sophomore season . Never mind that she 's 13th on the money list , has five top 15 finishes and has n't missed a cut in eight starts . The 19-year-old California native is still not especially satisfied with her start to the season , though she said this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergence was evident early Thursday , when Creamer hit an 8-iron from 153 yards out in the fairway into the cup for an eagle on her second hole . By the time this wind-swept first round had ended , she had birdied her last hole to post a 1-under 70 that left her four shots behind 18-hole leader Karrie Webb ( 66 ) , who chipped in from 50 feet for one of her eight birdies and sank a 45-foot putt for another . <p> " So far this year , I have n't met my expectations , " Creamer said . " But I 'm just trying to stay patient and not get ahead of myself and just go out there , relax and have fun , let all the hard work I 've done pay off . " <p> Some of the hardest work came during ages 14 through 17 , when Creamer and her parents , Paul and Karen , moved from Pleasanton , Calif. , to Bradenton , Fla. , so she could attend the David Leadbetter Golf Academy . Her father , a U.S. Naval Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , who started playing golf at age 10 , has always been a fine athlete and a fierce competitor . <p> " We would watch Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley go at it on TV , " her father said . " I told her they would tear each other 's heart out on the basketball court , and then they 'd go out to dinner afterward and laugh about it . She 's like that when she 's inside the ropes . When she 's playing , she wants to tear your heart out , but when it 's over , she knows she also has to put it back in place . She 's just a great kid . " <p> Creamer 's penchant for pink led one of her Leadbetter classmates , Casey Wittenberg , now a Nationwide Tour player , to label her the " Pink Panther " when she was 14 . She has several licensing deals with Japanese companies to produce items under that moniker , with more contracts likely on the way if she stays at the highest level of her game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a dominating junior career , winning 11 American Junior Golf Association events , was a semifinalist in 2003 and 2004 in the U.S. Women 's Amateur and the U.S. Junior Girls and was a member of the victorious 2004 Curtis Cup team . <p> While still a 17-year-old amateur , she won the 2004 LPGA Qualifying tournament by five shots and turned pro immediately . <p> Four days before her high school graduation last year , she made a 17-foot putt on the final hole to win the Sybase Classic in New Rochelle , N.Y . and became the youngest winner of a multi-round tournament in LPGA history . Two months later , she won the Evian Masters in France by eight shots , becoming the youngest woman to reach $1 million in LPGA career earnings . She finished a spectacular season by leading the U.S. to victory over Europe in the Solheim Cup last fall , posting the best record ( 3-1-1 ) and drubbing English veteran Laura Davies , 7 and 5 , in singles . She shot a 30 on the front nine and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Asked if she could have imagined being this successful this soon , Creamer smiled and said : " My expectations are very high , definitely . I feel that if I do n't achieve what I want to achieve , then I basically have not necessarily failed , but I have n't proven anything to myself . You know I work really hard at it . I would n't expect anything other than to be the best . " <p> Among the current crop of high-profile young players , she 's hardly alone in setting such lofty goals . Her most natural rival likely will be 16-year-old Michelle Wie , another prodigy who turned pro last October but is not a full-time member of the LPGA . Other promising young players include two American rookies , 17-year-old Morgan Pressel and 20-year-old Brittany Lang , who tied for second at last year 's U.S. Women 's Open in Denver as amateurs . <p> Creamer , who also has a number of lucrative deals , said she and Wie are friends and that she does not concern herself with any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I do n't feel like I have a rival , " she said . " I just try to take care of my own business . It 's probable that I 'll play a lot of golf with Wie . But the biggest rival for me is the golf course . That 's what you always have to keep in your mind . I can only take care of myself , and she can only take care of herself . That 's how you have to approach it , and I do n't think that 's going to change . " <p> Creamer acknowledged that there is more pressure on her to perform this season after her stunning pro debut in 2005 . She admitted that may have something to do with her relatively sluggish start this year . <p> " It is a little disappointing that I have n't won yet , " she said . " But I still pinch myself . Here I am in my second year and people think I should be winning . That 's a good feeling to have , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , I 've played well , but then I have one bad day . My game is there , and there 's no reason I ca n't win . I 've also learned a lot about myself . I know sometimes I get ahead of myself and that puts more pressure on . I just have to relax and let it happen , and it will . " <p> Creamer may think she has no rivals , but she freely acknowledges having a role model : Hall of Famer Juli Inkster , a seven-time major champion and still a major force in the game at the age of 45 . <p> " I look up to Juli so much , " Creamer said . " She has a family . She loves what she does . And when you watch her she puts a smile on your face and you pull for her so badly . She really puts it out there . I met her at a Junior Solheim Cup in Minnesota when I was 16 . I actually carried her bag for a hole and it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Solheim Cup , I asked her , ' Do you remember me carrying your bag ? ' She goes , ' What are you talking about ? You never carried my bag . ' I was like , ' Yeah , I did , and it was the highlight of my life . ' Then she said , ' Oh yeah , you were like 30 yards behind me . ' I said , ' Yep , that was me . ' " <p> Though she 's not considered one of the LPGA 's longest hitters , Creamer is rarely 30 yards behind anyone off the tee these days after adding 15 yards of length in the offseason . She 's already one of the finest putters on her tour , and no less an authority than Annika Sorenstam described Creamer 's rookie year as " impressive , very impressive , yeah . She strikes the ball really solid . Her iron shots are very , very accurate , and her strength is probably her putting . " <p> Creamer is loving her life right now . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow her to take some classes in the offseason and let her do some of the course work on the Internet , though golf clearly remains her top priority . <p> " I love what I do , " she said . " I 'm very lucky that this is my job . I have so much I want to achieve on the golf course , and not only there , but as a person , as well . Now , I 'm expected to win , and that 's fine . I want to win and play well for everyone . But at the end of the day , I have to play well for myself . "
