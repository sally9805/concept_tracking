( Bering Sea ) <p> The Pribilof Islands of Alaska in the Bering Sea consist of five islands : St. Paul , St. George , Walrus , Otter , and Sea Lion Rock . They were discovered in 1786 by Russian fur traders who landed first on St. George which they named Larher Island and then to the north St. Peter and St. Paul islands . Archeological records reveal no sign of habitation of the Pribilofs prior to their occupancy by the Russians . <p> The community of St. Paul is located on a narrow peninsula on the southern tip of the largest of the five Pribilof islands . The total population of around 800 is predominantly Aleut with a small group of Eskimo and Indian residents . <p> The Pribilofs are a photographer 's paradise with many opportunities , especially of nature subjects ! <p> A variety of sea mammals and seabirds have lived on the shores of these remote islands for centuries . The Pribilofs host more than two million seabirds each year . About 200 species have been identified on these islands , with about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best seabird colonies in North America . Among the species commonly seen on these islands are Red-faced Cormorant , Oldsquaw , Rock Sandpiper , Northern Fulmar , Parakeet , Least and Crested Auklet , Common and Thick-billed Murre , Red-legged Kittiwake , and the Horn and Tufted Puffin . ORNITHOLOGY ( Bird Watcher 's Paradise ) <p> The visit to St. Paul and the neighboring islands like Hall and St. Matthew Islands is especially geared for bird watchers rather than photographers as one would find it difficult for the latter to take high quality photographs from a moving Zodiac crowded with 9-10 passengers in turbulent waters or a heavy swell . In most cases , photographers revert to powerful binoculars or share a glimpse through a telescope mounted on a heavy tripod from a friendly bird watcher . A Bird List was documented by four main bird watcher groups formed by different associations leaving only a small minority of serious photographers . The photographer 's situation is different as one has to get close to the subject matter to obtain a full frame result , which in itself requires military skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumbling face just to capture a brief glimpse of the nesting seabird on a narrow ledge . During this exercise in order to capture this opportunity , one often puts one 's life at risk in trying to clear vegetation which obscures vision . Secondly , most photography is hand held with long and weighty telephoto lenses of 400 mm plus and without tripods as space is not available ; further , the cliff might be wet from sea mist , light rain , or even morning dew and exposed to very strong coastal winds . For the inexperienced cliff-top photographer , vertigo is a problem which seriously affects one 's sense of balance and is often the cause of accidents . <p> The two species photographed at close range were : <p> a . Tufted Puffin ( Lunda cirrhata ) ( height : medium 16 inches ) <p> b . Thick-billed Murre or Brunnich 's Guillemot ( Uria lomvia ) ( height : medium 18 inches ) <p> Photographs of the two watercolor paintings by Lars Jonsson ( Swedish Artist ) illustrate that different passengers on a cruise can occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photography ; or bird watching by viewing through a powerful telescope mounted on a heavy tripod or through binoculars which send bird watchers ecstatic as they tick off their bird list ; or the walkers , beach-combers , or straight pebble collectors . The two watercolor paintings illustrate the beauty of two birds seen in the region but are difficult to photograph ; they are : <p> a . Crested Auklet ( Aethia cristatella ) <p> b . McKay 's Bunting ( Plectrophenax hyperboreous ) <p> The McKay 's Bunting is rare and difficult to find without powerful binoculars or telepscope as it is small and sometimes blends in with the landscape and is only found on St. Matthew Island where it breeds . BOTANY AND GEOLOGY <p> The Pribilofs are part of a remote volcanic archipelago , located in the Bering Sea with the nearest landfall being western Alaska and the Aleutian Islands approximately 300 miles either direction . All the islands in the chain are actually the tips of a sub-oceanic mountain range . The west and southern parts of St. Paul are steep and rugged , with rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local bluffs , the shoreline in this part of the island has both rocky and sandy beaches while the remainder of the island is comparatively low , with a rolling plateau dotted with extinct volcanic peaks . <p> The Pribilof Islands are notoriously known for poor weather conditions especially a thick fog which envelopes the islands . <p> The tundra landscape on these islands will commonly show species such as Lapland longspurs , Arctic poppies , Louseworts , Rock jasmine , Chickweed , and Lupine . Trees do not exist , and willows and scrubs are rarely more than a few inches tall . The lasting memory on the botanical side was the fields of Lupine Nootketensis soaked in morning dew which gave a wonderful carpet of blue and were interspersed on small rocky mounds with Potentilla villosa . NORTHERN FUR SEAL ROCKERY <p> The Northern Fur Seal rockery at Reef Point is a protected area with a high wooden viewing blind erected to prevent the intrusion of humans from the mating area below , but at the same time , one can photograph easily with a long telephoto lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is classified as a pinniped . The name is derived from Latin for " flap-footed " ; these marine mammals are thought to have derived from bear-like ancestors which entered the sea millions of years ago . They have a life span between 14-26 years , and statistics show that males ( bulls ) reach the height of nearly 9 feet weighing over 375 pounds to over 600 pounds while females ( cows ) are about 4 1/2 feet with an average weight of 65-110 pounds . Physical description : <p> The Northern Fur Seals have a short , pointed face with large rear flippers . Pups are black at birth , but as they mature , they become dark brown in coloration with a pale patch on the neck . Distribution : <p> The Northern Fur Seals are found throughout the North Pacific Ocean . The primary rookeries ( breeding sites ) are on the Pribilof Islands and the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea . Diet : <p> The main component of the Northern Fur Seal diet is fish such as herring , anchovy , pollack , and capelin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ males are territorial ; and after their arrival on the rookeries from late May , they establish territories by threatening and fighting other males . They continue to defend their territories by threatening each other with stereotyped vocal and aggressive displays . These fights occur occasionally but are generally brief . One male will lunge at another and attempt to bite the relatively vulnerable fore flippers rather than the broad and well-protected neck and chest . Within a few weeks , however , several thousand pregnant female seals will haul out to give birth . When this happens , the rookery is crowded . A female will choose a territory in which to have her pup . This territory is managed by the male Fur Seal called the " Beachmaster " ; and after the birth , the female will nurse the pup . After about 7-10 days , she will begin making foraging trips to sea every few days , nursing her pup while on land . The female copulates with the male just before her first trip to sea . Adult males can loose nearly 20 percent of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the breeding season . Fur Seals tend to live alone or in pairs and rarely come to land , except to breed . Their main predators are sharks , killer whales , and Steller sea lions if given the opportunity . <p> The Pribilofs are an ideal location for the nature photographer . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Northern Fur Seal <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Thick-billed Murre <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Tufted Puffin <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Lupine Nootkatensis <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Potentilla Villosa <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Crested Auklet ( watercolor painting by Lars Jonsson ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : McKay 's Bunting ( watercolor painting by Lars Jonsson ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Northern Fur Seals <p> By Derek M.
