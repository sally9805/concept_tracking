Like candles in a magical mirror box , the bright objects that fill this seemingly endless , shapeless cosmos may in fact be part of an optical illusion on the grandest scale - little more than a series of repeating images bound in finite space with a distinct shape . See " Laps of Light " on page 39 for more . // Armed with new observational data astronomers are working on an architectural rendering of the cosmos . " Your theory of a donut-shaped universe intrigues me , Homer . " - Stephen Hawking , guest-voicing in The Simpsons . As always then , life is a tale told by an idiot , in this case to a genius . And yet the fact that the world 's most famous astrophysicist endorses Homer 's vision of the universe as a takeout snack should not , it turns out , surprise us . Because the donut - or torus - currently stands high on the experts ' short list of candidates for the possible shape of the universe . And by the end of this year , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if Homer is right . " Serious observational work to determine the shape of the universe has only just started in the last decade " says Boud Roukema , a researcher at the University of Nicolas Copernicus in Torun , Poland . " The race is on to obtain the first significant results . " So what are the possible shapes of our universe ? Probably the most obvious intuitive answer , projected from our normal experience , is that the universe is simply a three-dimensional space , full of energy and matter , stretching away in all directions like a vast sphere . Some doubt remains about whether this space is best thought of as finite or infinite . The finite - or " bounded "  --  version is hampered by a philosophical paradox : What would lie beyond the boundary , beyond space 's final frontier ? And so , almost by default , most of us non-cosmologists have come to imagine the universe , if at all , as a kind of infinitely large threedimensional sphere . This last feature - three physical dimensions - seems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any less than three dimensions , and what could it mean to have more ? For mathematicians , at least , the answer to this last question is simple . We can represent any point in three-dimensional space with three coordinates , say x , y and z , where x is the left-right , y the forward-backward , and z the updown term . By simply adding a fourth term , say w , we can mathematically represent any point in four dimensions . Photograph As far as we can perceive , we who inhabit this universe are creatures of a three-dimensional ( 3-D ) world . However , some cosmologists now theorize that the universe takes on a distinct shape in an imperceptible fourth dimension ( 4-D ) , also referred to as " hyperspace . " A higher dimension is difficult to envision , but one way to get a hint of how it might appear as it interacts with a lower dimension is to consider the illustration above . This depicts what a 3-D realm may look like as it passes through the two-dimensional ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of figures represents how we 3-D " space  --  landers " would see a meeting and departure of the two realms , while the bottom row shows how the event might look like to those shallow souls stuck in the flatlands . // Such a fourth dimension - also known as hyperspace would exist at right angles to everything . This fact makes it very difficult , some commentators would say impossible , to picture or imagine a fourth dimension . Attempts to communicate a sense of this extra " axis " of reality are usually made through analogy . Imagine a world of " fiat " beings , inhabiting a two-dimensional realm like an infinite tabletop . Such planar creatures and their world would stand in the same relationship to us that we do to a hypothetical fourth dimension . This hard-to-visualize fourth dimension is particularly intriguing to cosmologists because it can be used to imagine how the universe might be closed . An immediate critique of this idea is that , to the best of our knowledge , the fabric of space certainly does n't appear to curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning to analogy again , imagine you lived on the surface of a sphere . If this sphere were large enough , its curved surface would appear flat - or two-dimensional - in the local vicinity , disguising from its inhabitants the existence of a third dimension " bending " the other two . In fact , of course , you do live on such a sphere - Earth  --  whose " extra " third dimension remained hidden to its inhabitants for much of their history . A new wave of cosmologists is now proposing the cosmic equivalent of discovering that Earth was a sphere . From Donuts to Pretzels Into what kinds of shapes , then , might the universe be bent in hyperspace ? Well , take a square flat sheet of rubber and bend it until two of its opposite edges join , producing a cylinder . Now join the two edges of the cylinder , producing a shape known technically as a " two-torus , " the shape of the common donut . The two-torus has a higher-dimensional analog known as a " three-torus . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bending it in such a way that all three pairs of matching faces - front and back , left and right , top and bottom - were joined to each other simultaneously . If this " cube " were the entire space of our three-dimensional universe , then the bending operation , which can be imagined by recourse to a fourth dimension , would produce the three  --  torus " donut " of Homer 's theory . Again , this concept is easier to model mathematically than it is to imagine . A computer simulation of a three-torus world simply makes opposite cube faces contiguous with each other . The classic " Asteroids " video game did this in one less dimension : objects leaving the screen at one edge instantly re-appeared at the opposite edge . Now imagine a cubic " Asteroids " screen , where objects passing out through one square face instantly reenter through the opposite one , and you have managed your own simulation of Homer 's three-torus world . And as Homer would no doubt be comforted to hear , there is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Cambridge notes , " If we artificially bend a hexagonal tile into three dimensions and glue the sides together , what we find is another way to make a torus . " And why stop with only six faces ? An octagon with its eight triangular faces paired ( or " glued " ) , would produce a figure  --  eight , or double-holed pretzel shape , a promising subject for a future exposition by Homer . The appropriate " Asteroids " screen would be an eight-sided solid , with objects simultaneously entering and leaving the four pairs of opposite " glued " screens . Beyond the Edge This cosmic origami generates universes of a definite shape and of a finite size , and yet without the problematic " edge " of earlier models . Again , it helps to think of our analogy in three dimensions . " The surface of our Earth is a definite shape and a finite size , " observes Levin . " And yet it does not have that " edge " that Renaissance explorers feared to sail over . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's surface results in a circumnavigation of the globe , so that all straight-line journeys end where they began . The same would be true for our closed universe . Like an " Asteroids " - type starship , any object voyaging outward from Earth in a continually straight trajectory would eventually return to its point of origin , having traversed the entire circumference of the universe . Photograph The 4-D shape of a so-called three-torus is best represented mathematically . However , we can concoct its lower  --  dimensional analog , the donut-like two-torus , which then hints at the making of a three-torus . Above , left : The making of a " donut , " or two-torus , from a square flat piece of rubber . Above , right : A three-torus is made with a rubber cube , representing the entire 3-D universe . If we could bend the cube in such a way that all three pairs of matched faces were glued together , we 'd behold a three-torus. // The term " any object " includes , of course , particles of light , or photons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would describe a curved path , eventually returning to its point of origin . Therefore a light source - such as our own galaxy would project an image of itself which , after traversing the circumference of the universe , would be visible from itself . And the light would not stop there , but would continue traveling ; and , if the universe were old enough , the light would eventually circumnavigate the universe once more , projecting a second image back onto its original light-source . And so on for subsequent " light-laps " of the universe . The implications for contemporary cosmology are truly staggering . When we look up at distant galaxies in the night sky , it is possible that what we are seeing is not a single , vast or infinite number of galaxies , but the same finite set of galaxies repeated throughout the sky , like torchlights in a hall of mirrors . " The universe could appear vast to us , unfolded , ' filled with billions of galaxies , " observes Jean-Pierre Luminet , Director of Research at the Paris Observatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded up ; and contain only a small number of objects . A gigantic optical illusion . " It 's All in the Fundamentals Such an " illusion " would , however , offer the possibility of experimental investigation . If the visible universe is in fact a virtual honeycomb built up from a single building block , or " fundamental polyhedron , " then study of the sky could allow us to decide what shape that polyhedron is . And there are many contenders . In normal three-dimensional space , only the cube or regular hexagon of Homer 's donut can be fitted together ( or " tiled " ) to produce a honeycomb . However , it turns out that we do n't yet know just how " normal " space actually is . " Space-time tells matter how to move , and matter tells spacetime how to curve , " goes the pithy summary of Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity . The amount of matter in the universe determines the curvature of space , which could be flat , spherical or hyperbolic . A flat universe results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical density . If the density of matter is greater than the critical density , we get spherical curvature , and for densities less than the critical density we get hyperbolic curvature . We do n't yet know what the density of the universe is , because much of its content seems to be in the form of dark matter , which we ca n't see . But current observations suggest that the universe is pretty close to flat , in the same way that any continent on Earth is pretty close to flat . The geometry of the flat universe is reassuringly similar to what we learned in math classes at school - parallel lines never meet , and the angles of a triangle always add up to 180 . But these rules do n't apply for the other universes . In the spherical universe , parallel lines eventually converge , much as lines of longitude meet at Earth 's poles , and triangle angles total more than 180 deg . Whereas in the hyperbolic universe , parallel lines tend to diverge , and the angles of a triangle add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matter in the universe determines its density . In turn , the density determines the curvature of space-time , which could be flat , spherical ( closed ) , or hyperbolic ( open ) . In a closed universe parallel lines always meet and the sum of the angles in a triangle exceeds 180 deg . In a flat universe parallel lines never meet and the sum of the angles in a triangle equals 180 deg . In an open universe parallel lines tend to converge and the sum of the angles in a triangle is less than 180 deg . Current observational data suggest the universe is very near flat . but may teeter toward on or closed . Photograph Whan astronomers look at the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) they are also spying a wall of light known as the " surface of last scattering " This was , in effect , the universe 's incipient release of photons , which have traveled the same distance to reach us at the same time ( since the speed of light is finite ) . Because of this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( shown above as the inside of a sphere surrounding Earth ) using COBE and future MAP data to look for matching patterns in CMB temperature fluctuations . If matches are found , then cosmologists will be fairly sure of the universe 's curvature and could possibly decipher the shape and size of the " fundamental polyhedron " constituting the universe . // The number of contenders for shapes that could tile a flat universe is limited , but a spherical or hyperbolic universe offers endless possibilities . Particular shapes of tiles will only work for specific curvatures . Imagine trying to tile your ( flat ) floor with octagonal tiles - it ca n't be done because they overlap . However , if you lived in a hyperbolic house , the octagons would tile the floor perfectly , because the smaller angles they occupy in hyperbolic space mean they can be tiled without overlap . In fact , Homer 's octagon-based double-holed pretzel universe would only be possible in hyperbolic space . Chasing Ghosts in Mirror Worlds Whatever the eventual shape , there is an obvious method to detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single object should be seen in different sky directions and at different distances . " The precise pattern of these object repetitions would allow cosmologists to distinguish between the different proposed shapes of the universe . The natural original candidates for such research were galaxies themselves . The new theorists have been ransacking current sky maps and astronomical data catalogs in the hope of identifying galaxy twins ( or perhaps octuplets , depending on the eventual shape ) in different parts of the sky . But this project is turning out to be more problematic than the researchers anticipated . The further removed in the virtual honeycomb the " ghost cell " containing a galaxy , the longer its light takes to reach us . This means that the same galaxy viewed in different cells would be at different ages in its evolution . According to Levin , " Trying to match galaxies is like trying to match pictures of babies with pictures of their elderly selves " In addition , images from different ghost cells of the universe would reach us from different angles , requiring matching galaxies to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another option is to look at quasars . These are the brightest and most distant objects yet discovered , and so would allow us to look for patterns on larger scales . However , this method suffers from the same problems as galaxy matching . Quasars also look different at different stages in their evolution . And they emit electromagnetic radiation in a non-symmetrical way , again making identification from different angles difficult . Researchers are still hoping that with more comprehensive data maps , such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , and more sophisticated statistical analysis , galaxies and quasars will help to provide a solution . But , at the moment , a different method offers the best bet in the race to determine the shape of the universe . This method looks back even further in time , to the universe 's very first light . We can still detect some leftover radiation from the Big Bang . The Cosmic Microwave Background , as it 's known , offers an ideal snapshot in time , according to Neil Cornish of Montana State University . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as far as we can see , to a wall of light known as the " surface of last scattering . " Immediately after the Big Bang , the universe was a seething mass of particles and photons . Photons scattered off matter , much as they would off water droplets in fog , and could n't go anywhere . It took around 400,000 years before the universe had cooled sufficiently for the particles to combine to form hydrogen , which photons can pass through . Photograph Laps of Light In a closed , curved universe light would be bound to return to its point of origin . A light source , such as our Milky Way Galaxy , would project an image of itself which , after rounding the universe , would also be visible from itself . If the universe were sufficiently old the light would keep on circulating the cosmos , making a series of " light laps , " and observers would see a series of multiple ghost-like images of the same object . The hypothesis seems easy to test - find objects that are exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closed universe . Unfortunately , this experiment would only work if the speed of light were infinite . However , it 's finite , of course , which means the farther the object lies from the observer , the younger it will appear . Moreover , celestial objects change over time ( as represented here by the pyramids evolving into octahedrons ) and may look quite different over billions of years . The Milky Way Galaxy is shown here in its progression from a diffuse gas cloud to a protogalaxy , and then on to the intricate spiral structure that we see today . // Anything before the last photon scattering is forever clouded from us , but we can detect the first photons to have escaped . We find them at microwave wavelengths , at a temperature of 3 Kelvins ( - 454 deg Fahrenheit , or - 270 deg Celsius ) . Since they must have all traveled exactly the same distance to reach us at the same time ( because the speed of light is finite ) , we see the wall of last scattering as the inside surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , if the universe is tiled , and there are many different copies of Earth , there must be many copies of this sphere . If the shape of the fundamental polyhedron is small enough , these spheres will intersect , along circles . The size of these circles would depend on how much the spheres overlapped , and so would give an indication of the size of the fundamental polyhedron . Is the Writing on the Wall ? But how can we spot these circles ? From 1989-93 , NASAs Cosmic Background Explorer ( COBE ) mapped the microwave sky , and found that it 's not a perfect 3 Kelvins everywhere  --  there are slight fluctuations in its temperature . Cornish , along with his collaborators David Spergel of Princeton University and Glenn Starkman of Case Western Reserve University , thinks that searching for patterns in these fluctuations may be the key to finding out the universe 's shape . The team hopes to trace out different temperature patterns along circles , and then find the same pattern along another circle elsewhere in the sky . " Patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Cornish . The precise pattern of circles will indicate the fundamental polyhedron 's shape . COBE 's achievement in making the first map of the microwave sky was impressive . But the map was n't quite detailed enough for pattern-spotting . NASAs Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( MAP ) , launched last year , will map the microwave sky in unprecedented detail , providing the data that Cornish , Spergel and Starkman need for their search . " MAP will finish its first complete scan in March and then we can begin our analysis , " says Spergel . " We hope to have the results by the end of the year " Of course , you can draw an infinite number of circles of every possible size on the sky , so they have a gargantuan task ahead of them . It would take months of supercomputing time to sift through all the data . To speed things up , they are first going to look for the signatures of shapes corresponding to flat and spherical curvatures . " This way , if you pick one circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " explains Cornish . " Every shape produces a unique fingerprint - if we find it we can pin down the shape of the universe . " If nothing comes out of the search for flat candidates , they will move on to the search for candidates from the infinitely large spherical and hyperbolic families . If nothing comes out of this , it does n't necessarily imply we live in a simple , non-tiled universe . The universe could still be tiled , but the fundamental polyhedron might be so humongous that its edges are way beyond our view . " If the universe is relatively large compared to its age , that is , if it 's significantly bigger than about 15 billion light-years across , " Levin observes , " then light from our ghost images will not have time to reach us before the death of this planet . ' The Shape of Things to Come So the universe may indeed be finite and bounded , and yet too vast to yield to us the secret of its shape . Alternatively , the universe may possess spherical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among limitless possibilities . Such thoughts are met with quiet stoicism by the new wave of cosmologists : " The universe is however it is " Roukema acknowledges , " not how I would like it to be . " But there remains the tantalizing third possibility - that the universe is actually quite small , and possesses flat curvature . In that case , within a few months of reading this article , we might well know whether Homer 's donut is truly the shape of things to come .
