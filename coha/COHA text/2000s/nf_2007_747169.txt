Events such as urbanization , globalization , and terrorism have brought the need for a stronger , larger , more diverse , and more competent public health workforce to the forefront of public planning ( Pappaioanou , 2004 ) . A growing number of medical issues are resulting from increasing human-wildlife contact , environmental changes , expansion of international travel , antimicrobial misuse , intensification and integration of food production , and growth of the immunocompromised population ( World Health Organization , 1999 ) . <p> Veterinarians have training that gives them a unique capacity to address public health issues and to help meet public health needs . On completion of their clinical training , veterinarians take an oath that states : " I solemnly swear to use my scientific knowledge and skills for the benefit of society through . the promotion of public health and the advancement of medical knowledge " ( American Veterinary Medical Association , 1999 , emphasis added ) . Although veterinary medicine and environmental public health have long had many common competencies , practices , and accomplishments in common , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Veterinary Medicine ? <p> Veterinary medicine is " real medicine . " Schooling consists of a rigorous four-year postbaccalaureate program of medical and surgical training . After successfully passing a national examination , veterinarians in the United States can become licensed to practice on all but human animal species in any U.S. state or territory . Veterinarians are among the few clinicians whose success requires both a solid understanding of the importance of diagnosing and treating the " whole " animal and a thorough application of herd/population health principles and preventive medicine . Like their physician colleagues , many veterinarians also complete an internship/residency or advanced training that leads to board certification in one or more of the 20 veterinary specialties . Of note to the environmental health practice community , one such specialty organization may be of particular interest for the environmental health practice community : The American College of Veterinary Preventive Medicine requires demonstrated proficiency in the public health domains of epidemiology and biostatistics , food safety , infectious and parasitic diseases , environmental health and toxicology , and public administration and health education . A recent World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health as " the sum of all contributions to the physical , mental , and social well-being of humans through an understanding and application of veterinary science " ( WHO Study Group on Future Trends in Veterinary Public Health , p. 4 , 2002 ) . This definition establishes the context  --  protection and improvement of human health in which veterinarians make their contribution . It also describes how those who learn and apply the scientific principles of veterinary medicine are part of a core public health practice activity with global impact . There is an explicit understanding that " veterinary public health activities must be carried out in close partnership with other public health efforts to ensure positive health outcomes " ( WHO Study Group on Future Trends in Veterinary Public Health , p. 4 , 2002 ) . Veterinarians in the Contemporary Practice of Public Health <p> Today , veterinarians serve many public health roles . Although veterinarians are estimated to make up less then 1 percent of the public health workforce ( Gebbie , 2000 ) , recent educational and policy influences have renewed the interest in increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such professionals and their functions can be found in the sidebar on this page . <p> Because veterinarians work at the interface of human , animal , and environmental health , they are uniquely positioned to view health through the lens of public health impact . Changes in land use , creation and operation of large terrestrial and marine food production units , and microbial and chemical pollution of land and water sources have created new threats to the health of both animals and humans ( Zinsstag , Schelling , Wyss , &; Mahamat , 2005 ) . The intensive responses to the intentional release of anthrax , the periodic contamination of seafood production beds , the spread of West Nile virus , the importation of monkey-pox , the widely publicized occurrence of large foodborne-disease outbreaks , and the threat of pandemic influenza all serve as recent models illustrating the impact and burden of disease on the resources of public health infrastructure ( Kahn , 2006 ; King , 2006 ) . The need for integrated animal and human health surveillance , diagnostic laboratory systems , and delivery of effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professions has never been more essential . <p> Veterinarians are turning to environmental health scientists and practitioners to develop their understanding that many outbreaks and public health emergencies are failures of veterinary prevention infrastructure . It has been demonstrated that the professions can work together to investigate the environmental antecedents that lead to adverse health outcomes ( Cassady et al. , 2006 ) . By strengthening epidemiologic and laboratory investigations that assess the role of environmental influences , this partnership can help to develop and apply sustainable and effective community health interventions . With their understanding of biological interactions and clinical experience  --  as well as their roots in preventive medicine  --  veterinarians are ideal environmental health service partners . <p> As the veterinary profession broadens the perception of what a veterinarian can do , the term " one world  --  one medicine " may signify the acceptance that veterinary medicine is also a human health activity . Together with their partners in health protection and promotion , veterinarians can improve public health practice with a renewed focus on the complex interactions that affect environmental , animal , and human health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up-to-date and relevant information on environmental health and to build partnerships in the profession . In pursuit of these goals , we will feature a column from the Environmental Health Services Branch ( EHSB ) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in every issue of the Journal . <p> EHSB 's objective is to strengthen the role of state , local , and national environmental health programs and professionals to anticipate , identify , and respond to adverse environmental exposures and the consequences of these exposures for human health . The services being developed through EHSB include access to topical , relevant , and scientific information ; consultation ; and assistance to environmental health specialists , sanitarians , and environmental health professionals and practitioners . <p> EHSB appreciates NEHA 's invitation to provide monthly columns for the Journal . EHSB staff will be highlighting a variety of concerns , opportunities , challenges , and successes that we all share in environmental public health .
