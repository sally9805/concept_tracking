Find a clock , and watch five seconds tick by . For allied soldiers driving tanks through the Iraqi desert , that 's a generous amount of time in which to do the following : spot a vehicle through the optics system , consult the last available coordinates for all known battlefield combatants , try to identify the vehicle 's type , check if it has a special panel that appears as a cold spot through a thermal sight , add it all together and decide whether the image on the screen is friend or foe . If it 's the latter , the crew , under pressure to shoot before being shot at , is likely to pull the trigger  --  then hope like hell it has not accidentally blasted a group of comrades . <P> That proved a futile hope for the crew of a British Challenger 2 tank fighting outside Basra in pitch darkness last week . The crew blasted another Challenger , killing two compatriots inside . Among other friendly-fire episodes of the war so far : a U.S. Patriot missile shot down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died after two British armored vehicles came under fire , possibly from a U.S. A-10 aircraft . U.S. officials are investigating another incident near Nasiriyah , in which one Marine unit fired on another , wounding more than 30 . <P> In today 's conflicts , friendly fire is a growing risk . In the last Gulf War , 35 of the 146 Americans killed in action , or 24% , died at the hands of their allies . In previous wars , the percentage was much lower . Although precise data are hard to come by , Kenneth Steinweg , a U.S. colonel who studied U.S. Army War College records , estimated in 1995 that comparable rates , based on the best-documented battles , were 16% in World War II , 11% to 14% in Vietnam and 13% in Panama . <P> Why is the problem growing , at least proportionally ? The answer , in part , is that enemy fire is less of a problem . " We have so overwhelmed our enemies that the ratio has climbed , " says Lieut . Colonel Chris Hughes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact that our enemies have not been able to inflict serious damage on us . " It 's also a reflection of the way weapons systems have advanced faster than recognition capabilities . A target can be hit with precision long before it can be identified . The accuracy and lethality of modern U.S. weapons systems are also factors . So is the fog of war : fear , sleeplessness and confusion  --  constants in any war  --  can cause human beings to make mistakes . <P> The bitter experience of 1991 led the U.S. military to devote more energy to minimizing friendly fire , now officially called fratricide  --  literally , the killing of one 's brother . These efforts may have helped reduce the numbers so far in Afghanistan , where four of 31 Americans killed in action , or 13% , were victims of friendly fire . In the new Gulf War , the U.S. Air Force has a dedicated anti-fratricide cell operating out of Saudi Arabia that reviews targeting decisions for air strikes . New technologies include : 1-sq. - in. strips of glow tape stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optics and night goggles , and tiny Phoenix Beacons , attached to vehicles and carried by soldiers , that emit a flashing infrared beam visible only through specially calibrated night-vision equipment .
