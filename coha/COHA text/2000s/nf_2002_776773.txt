A DAY WE 'LL NEVER FORGET // The ringing of an alarm clock dragged me reluctantly from a deep sleep at 5:45 A.M. on Tuesday , September 11 . My husband , Todd , rolled over and silenced the annoying noise . I roused slightly , peeking out from under the covers only long enough to notice it was still dark outside . Although I was n't ready to get up yet , I knew the bright morning sunshine would soon be streaming through the bay window in our bedroom . Pulling the covers up over my head , I attempted to go back to sleep . // We had just returned from Rome , Italy , late afternoon the previous day , so between the jet lag and the strain of being five months pregnant , a few extra minutes of sleep seemed like a good idea . I anticipated a full day ahead of me . Besides keeping up with our two energetic boys-David , our **25;874;TOOLONG , and Drew , who was 19 months-I had numerous tasks to accomplish . The laundry had stacked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the grocery store to replenish the refrigerator we had cleaned out before going away . After that I had several more errands to run . David would be starting preschool tomorrow , so I wanted to talk with him about the transition in our lives that " school " would bring . My to-do list grew longer even in my sleep as I remembered all the things I had to take care of after being away from home for a week . Vacation was over ; life was back to normal . I sighed inwardly . A Day We 'll Never Forget // Todd eased out of bed , trying his best not to disturb me as he headed toward the shower . As one of the top young sales representatives of the software giant Oracle Corporation , Todd traveled a lot for business as well as for pleasure . His job often required whirlwind trips , so to him , this early-morning flight was just another day at the office-a one-day jaunt to San Francisco to meet with some high-profile clients . He 'd catch the red-eye flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It 's no big deal , " he 'd said when he informed me of his plans to travel so soon after our return from Europe . " I 'll be back before you know it . " // Somewhere between being asleep and awake that Tuesday morning , I heard the shower running . A short time later I vaguely sensed Todd leaning over me and kissing me good-bye , as he always did before leaving for the day . Sometimes I 'd have the covers pulled up so high he 'd have to kiss the top of my head . That 's what he must have done that morning , because we did n't communicate verbally-or if we did , I do n't remember it . // I heard Todd 's footsteps going down the hardwood back steps and smiled to myself as I imagined him trying to walk quietly . When we 'd built our new home little more than a year earlier , I had n't wanted to carpet the steps because I did n't want to vacuum them ! But the price I paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Todd left for one of his predawn trips . // I snuggled a little farther down , burying myself beneath the blankets . The sun would be up soon , and the boys would rise shortly after that . Better get some last-minute sleep while I can . // By 6:45 the sun was indeed shining brightly through our bedroom window , so I hopped out of bed . It was a gorgeous blue-sky morning-not a cloud to be seen and unseasonably warm for September in New Jersey . What a beautiful day ! I thought . Maybe the boys and I will have some time to play outside later . // A habitual list maker , I started going over my grocery list , adding needed items and trying to get organized before the boys got up . I had just begun folding some laundry when I heard the patter of a little boy 's bare feet coming down the front staircase . // " Good morning , David ! " I hugged him in his pajamas . Drew waddled behind David in the telltale manner every mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drew . Let 's get that diaper changed before we have breakfast . " // It was a full-tilt morning , per usual life for a family with young children . // The boys sat up at our breakfast bar , and I got them some Froot Loops and Cheerios to eat . Later , after they 'd eaten and dressed , they watched Sesame Street while I went upstairs for a quick shower . // A few minutes after nine o'clock , as I was getting ready to go to the grocery store , the phone rang . I ignored it since I was about to walk out the door . But our answering machine picked up the call , and I heard the familiar voice of my friend Elaine Mumau . She sounded stressed . // " Hi , Lisa . I know Todd is traveling today ... and I was just calling to check on him .... Do you have your television turned on ? ... Have you seen what 's happening ? " // I grabbed the phone . " Elaine , what are you talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " Yes , he is . Why ? " // " Do you know his flight number ? " // " No , I do n't . Why , Elaine ? What 's going on ? " // " Turn the TV on , " Elaine instructed . " There 's been a plane crash at the World Trade Center . " // I turned on the television and saw the Twin Towers enveloped in a huge plume of smoke . A second plane had just smashed into one of the towers , tearing a gaping hole in the building and setting it ablaze . Commentators described the scene in shocked , pensive tones . I stood in front of our television , mesmerized by the horrific sight . Before long the newscasters reported that two planes-an American Airlines flight and a United Airlines flight-were missing and might have been the ones that hit the towers . The broadcasters speculated about possible terrorist involvement in the crashes . // I had no idea what flight Todd was on ; I did n't even know what airline he was flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago given up pressing him for travel itineraries . Most Oracle sales reps booked their travel on-line , so I did n't even have a travel agent to call for information . But I knew Todd was going to San Francisco . And since he often flew Continental Airlines on that route , I breathed a slight sigh of relief . // Nevertheless , as I stared in disbelief at the events unfolding live on television , my heart began pounding faster . Oh , those poor people ! I thought . How can this be happening ? ! // Although unsure of Todd 's whereabouts , I really was n't too worried about his safety . My husband was a seasoned traveler , and over the years he 'd learned how to deal with almost any situation frequent air travelers encounter-delayed flights , missed flights , canceled flights , mechanical problems , airline strikes-you name it , he 'd had to work around it . By now we 'd been married for more than seven years . Earlier in our marriage I 'd sometimes been overly agitated when Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airline incident or a bad accident on the highway in an area where Todd was traveling . My mind had immediately conjured up all sorts of awful images . But Todd had always come out fine , and after a while I stopped worrying about him so much . Neither of us had any fear of flying ; in fact , we often joked that the most dangerous part of our travel was the trek on the New Jersey Turnpike between our home in Cranbury , near Princeton , and the Newark airport . // Besides , Todd was a gadget nut who carried two cellular phones with him constantly-one in the car and one on his person . I nearly had to wrestle those phones out of his hands every time we went on vacation . If Todd was delayed or in any trouble , he 'd call . // Still , I was uneasy . I dialed the phone number for Continental Airlines , and , amazingly , got through to a customer service representative right away . I was among the lucky ones . Many calls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many people making calls , but also because so much of the communications system for the tristate area had been located atop the World Trade Center towers . Cellular calls fared little better than landlines for the same reasons . // The Continental representative refused to tell me whether Todd was aboard one of their planes , but he did say that their 7:00 A.M. flight had departed Newark with no problems . The second flight had n't yet left the terminal because the Federal Aviation Administration had grounded all flights until further notice . // I knew that if Todd 's flight had n't taken off , he would have called me , so I assumed he was safely aboard the earlier flight . Okay , there 's no need to worry , I assured myself as I hung up the phone . Todd 's probably halfway across the country by now . // A few minutes later it occurred to me that Todd had n't left the house until around 6:15 . Even on a good traffic day , Newark International Airport is a 30-minute drive from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging airport . That certainly did n't allow Todd much time if he had booked the early Continental flight . My stomach churned as I recalled that Todd sometimes flew United Airlines to San Francisco . I 'd better call them , just to check , I assured myself . // Completing a phone call was becoming ever more difficult . I paced back and forth while waiting through busy signals and negotiating the phone-tree maze , hoping to reach a human being . I was disappointed . United Airlines representatives were all " helping other customers . " I was soon to find out why . // Increasingly frustrated in my attempts to get any information about my husband , I was growing more anxious by the minute . Finally I called Elaine back . // Her husband , Brian , was working at home and answered the phone . I told him of my failed efforts and asked , " Can you try to find out what flight Todd is on ? I just ca n't do it right now . " // Brian must have sensed my uneasiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can find out . I 'll get right on it . " // " Thanks , Brian . " // " Lisa ? Elaine is going to come over . " // I hung up the phone , turned away from the television set , and walked back to the laundry room , where despite my best efforts to maintain composure , I burst into tears . When David came in and saw me crying , he asked , " What 's wrong , Mommy ? " // " It 's okay , " I answered , trying to hold back the tears . " I just do n't know where Daddy is right now . But do n't worry . We 'll find him . I 'm sure he 's fine ; I just do n't know what 's going on . " // David returned to his toys , and I picked up the phone again . I dialed Todd 's business cell-phone number and listened to his voice as his prerecorded message played through . " You 've reached Todd Beamer with the Oracle Corporation . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Todd , I know you 're fine . But when you land , please call me right away . I do n't know where you are and I need to hear from you . " // * * * // A few minutes later my phone rang . Hoping it was Todd on the line , I hurried out to the kitchen to answer it . " Hello ! " // There was no answer . The line had gone dead . I glanced at the digital clock on our kitchen oven . It was 10:00 A.M. // I took the phone with me back to the laundry room . A few seconds later the phone rang again . I quickly picked up the receiver , but the phone had already stopped ringing . " Hello ! Hello ? " I nearly screamed into the phone . Disconnected again ! // Todd ! Where are you ? // In my wildest imagination-or my worst nightmares-I could n't possibly have dreamed what Todd was actually experiencing at that precise moment . // * * * // Soon afterward , Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our family room and sat down on the couch in front of the television while the kids headed for the playroom . Just then the network switched from New York to Washington , D.C. , and scenes from the Pentagon came up on the screen . Another airliner had crashed into the side of our nation 's military headquarters around 9:43 A.M. , and the awful curl of thick black smoke had already risen high into the otherwise clear skies above the city . // And then the unthinkable happened . While rescue workers feverishly attempted to get people down and out of the World Trade Center , the south tower collapsed . Its steel girders , superheated by the ferocious jet-fuel fire , literally melted and crumbled in a massive , mangled heap . Less than half an hour later the north tower collapsed , releasing a horrendous cloud of smoke , ash , debris , and dust . Surreal scenes of ash-covered people running through the streets filled the television screen . // Now , like most Americans , I was reeling , attempting to comprehend the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction and loss of life . Questions I feared to ask aloud raced through my mind . Are there any survivors ? Are there more attacks to come ? How many more planes are out there with terrorists aboard ? My heart hurt for the unknown number of victims , and my concern for my own husband mounted . I fretted inwardly . Where 's Todd ? // At first Elaine and I sat on the couch with our eyes and ears riveted to the television set . Though shaken by the attacks on our nation and deeply grieved over the loss of life , I remained relatively calm until the networks showed yet another downed airliner . This one had crashed in a field in Pennsylvania . I knew that Todd 's flight would have traveled in that general direction . Cold shivers ran through my body , and a sick sensation clutched at my stomach as I gazed in horror at the crash site . Smoke still hovered in the air , and even from a distance I could see the charred ground . It was obvious the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impact . // The newscaster 's subdued voice reported that the downed flight was a United Airlines flight that had been bound for Chicago . // Chicago ? Whew ! Again I felt a rush of compassion for those people aboard the plane and their families , but I breathed a little easier for our family . We were off the hook again . Todd had an afternoon meeting in San Francisco ; he would n't have had time for a layover . So surely he would n't have booked anything other than a direct flight . // I got up nervously and stepped behind the couch , still staring at the television , when the newscaster 's voice intoned , " We have an update on the airliner that has crashed in Pennsylvania . It was not en route to Chicago as previously reported ; it was actually a United flight out of Newark that was going to San Francisco . " // " No ! " I screamed helplessly at the television . // Without a shred of hard evidence , I knew intuitively that Todd was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed a million pounds ; it seemed my heart might explode . I fell to my hands and knees and gasped again , " No ! " // In an instant Elaine joined me on the floor , wrapping her arms around me . " It 's probably not his flight , Lisa . He 's probably fine . We do n't know what 's what . Do n't worry . Todd 's okay . " // " No , Elaine ... that 's his plane , " I managed to say through my tears . // " We do n't know that .... " //
