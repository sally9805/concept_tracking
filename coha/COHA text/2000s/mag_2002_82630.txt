The traps were neatly set , and Miami and New England , the two unbeatens of the AFC East , fell into them . They were looking ahead to their matchup this Sunday . They were both on the road and favored slightly , over Kansas City and San Diego , respectively , two teams that had given everybody trouble . And down they went . // If you want to be generous , you can say that the Dolphins and the Patriots did n't give it their best effort because of the look-ahead factor , but that would be unfair to the Chiefs and the Chargers , who both played terrific games . And after looking almost invincible for the first three weeks , Miami and New England showed some cracks . // The Dolphins had n't trailed in their first three games , but when they had to play catch-up against K.C. , the interceptions came in bunches . The Patriots , for the second straight week , got hammered by the run . When Miami beat New England 30-10 early last season , the Dolphins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England in Foxboro in December , the Dolphins never got their ground game going . Clearly a heavy rushing attack by Miami would seem to be called for this week , but let 's look at this a little more closely . // Both running backs who killed the Patriots this year , the Chiefs ' Priest Holmes and the Chargers ' LaDainian Tomlinson , are nifty cutback runners , and San Diego had great success faking reverses and pitchouts and then coming back on counters . The Dolphins ' Ricky Williams is a power runner , and the trick-'em style has n't been Miami 's trademark . But you never know  --  if K.C. and San Diego can do it to New England .... // ? Prediction : The Patriots load up to stop the run . The Dolphins stick to a safe passing game but occasionally take their shots with quarterback Jay Fiedler and test the corners with Chris Chambers . The effectiveness of New England 's attack depends on whether injured wideout Troy Brown ( sore right knee ) returns . It 's a tough game to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Miami . // ? San Francisco has lost six straight to St. Louis , only one of them by fewer than 10 points . The Rams are tottering on the brink of oblivion with quarterback Kurt Warner out and two suspect tackles to protect backup Jamie Martin . Overconfidence for the Niners ? Not likely . It 's a chance m to get even . San Francisco wins big . // ? Carolina , which outplayed the Packers at Lambeau Field , is an old-fashioned team with a swarming defense and a precise , trap-block running game , and the Panthers get the nod over Arizona . Kansas City keeps its high-powered offense going at the Meadowlands against the reeling Jets , and New Orleans bounces back against Pittsburgh . Tennessee , with an unsettled pass defense , seems just right for the wiles of the Redskins ' Steve Spurrier . What wiles ? There ai n't any . The Titans are the pick . // ? Denver will cool off the red-hot Chargers . I like Philly over Jacksonville , but it 'll be closer than it looks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose defense got shoved around by Carolina . // ? I 'm still looking for an upset , and I just found three . Oakland suffers a slight letdown , and that 's all that Drew Bledsoe and the Bills need . Buffalo squeaks one out . The Giants , who promise that they will never again throw a sideline pass to run out the clock at the end of the half , rise up and hang one on Dallas . And Atlanta , which is better than people think-better than Tampa Bay thinks  --  upsets the Buccaneers.
