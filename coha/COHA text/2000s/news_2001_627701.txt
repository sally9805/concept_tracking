<p> " IN SUNLIGHT , IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN . " <p> By Kathleen Cambor . <p> Farrar , Straus &; Giroux , $ 23 . <p> WHILE In Sunlight , in a Beautiful Garden ca n't be described as a disaster novel , the Johnstown Flood of 1889 shadows all the action , a horror-in-waiting . <p> Probably few Americans recall that event , but at the time it made headlines around the world . Under heavy late-spring rains a poorly constructed earthen dam gave way and sent 20 million tons of water sluicing downstream through the small Pennsylvania industrial town . Some 2,200 people lost their lives . <p> The dam had been built ( more accurately , rebuilt ) a decade earlier to create a 450-acre lake for the summertime enjoyment of steel barons Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick and their friends and retainers . The private resort was called the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club . <p> The actual flood occupies only a handful of pages in this gracefully written , understated second novel by Houstonian Kathleen Cambor . Setting her book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cambor is more interested in delineating the inner lives of her dozen real and invented characters , tracing the interplay of chance and will that will put most of them 90 miles east of Pittsburgh on that fateful Memorial Day weekend . In short , what we have is less Perfect Storm , more Henry James . <p> Some novels are dialogue-driven . This one is n't , and what dialogue there is comes off as a little stiff . Narration , exposition and description predominate ; the pace is leisurely , measured . <p> Here is Cambor 's evocation of the ill-starred dam ( Nora is one of the principals in the book ) . <p> Perhaps Nora had been right about the dam when she was young , right to imagine that it could breathe , that it was in its own way a living thing . It was , after all , rock shards and earth , tree stumps , a mulch of disintegrating leaves and splintered branches and manure . A great organic giant . And it was fed by mountain springs that coursed through layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quick , so urgent that even after those waters combined and spread over the lakebed and grew calm , some memory of movement still stirred within them . The gathered waters pressed at the dam 's earthen side , pulsed heavily against it . Seeping water oozed from its face , where twigs and budding flowers trembled , brushing softly at each other with crackles and little whispered purrs . When standing close to it , more than once Nora had thought , Yes , it might be breathing . More creature than artifact . <p> This is wonderful prose - precise , evocative , warm yet disciplined . <p> The bulk of the novel consists of Cambor 's empathetic probing of her human characters . Assembling a rather large cast for a 258-page novel , she jumps back and forth between characters , telling their life stories in greater or lesser detail . The focus is on the search for love and the complex relations between husbands and wives and parents and children . <p> While not an overtly political novel , In Sunlight depicts a world of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heap are the new industrial rich , represented in the book by Carnegie , Frick and a young Andrew Mellon . For them the people of Johnstown are merely a labor pool from which to draw servants for the lakeside retreat . Cambor devotes the least space to this upper class , although she does have an affecting segment about the shy Mellon 's love match with a doomed , tubercular young woman . Wisely , the author does n't suggest that Laura 's death explains the industrialist 's hard attitude toward his economic inferiors . <p> The two main sets of characters are the Fallons and the Talbots . The former is a working-class family - father Frank , a Civil War veteran , is a foreman at the Cambria Iron Co. in Johnstown . Julia , his wife , is the daughter of a Chicago physician who had to flee that city in disgrace after botching a surgery . <p> Their son , Daniel , is ambivalent about his class roots . He accepts the opportunity to go off to college in Philadelphia but returns after two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize workers . The slowly developing romance between Daniel and the young Nora Talbot is the most important narrative thread in the book . <p> The Talbots are struggling to achieve a secure place among the middle-class professionals who rank just below the plutocrats . James Talbot is a lawyer hoping to make partner in the firm that handles the legal paperwork to set up the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club and build the dam . The only surviving son of ruined Virginia landowners , he 's a decent man forced to cut moral corners . Wife Evelyn is an ambitious social climber . <p> Their daughter , Nora , is perhaps the most fully developed character in the novel . As members of the resort , the Talbots spend two delicious weeks there each summer . Teen-age Nora tramps alone in the woods , studying the plants and insects she prefers to the company of her more frivolous peers . Daniel spots her from afar and begins leaving notes in her hiding places in the woods . An epistolary courtship develops that goes on for several summers before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best at anatomizing personality and motive and describing how both bend under the pressure of events . <p> In a moving section early in the book , for example , she tells the story of how Julia and Frank met , married and had four wonderful children . Then tragedy strikes . Daniel , the second oldest , comes down with diphtheria . He survives , but his two younger siblings die of the terrible fever , and Julia can never quite forgive her son for bringing the disease into the house . She shuts down emotionally , is " left hollowed , fractured , parched . " <p> Years later Julia begins to come out of her shell when she befriends a new arrival , Grace McIntyre , who has abandoned her domineering father , indifferent husband and comfortable Boston life to work as a librarian in Johnstown . But their friendship is imperiled when Frank , who has lived patiently in his damaged marriage , finds himself drawn to Grace , and she to him . As Memorial Day 1889 rolls around , Frank has decided to leave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tact . <p> Lives , hopes and budding relationships are swept away by the wall of water that descends on Johnstown . Not everyone suffers , of course . Carnegie , Frick and Mellon manage to avoid getting mud on their frock coats . Perhaps the most tragic figure in the novel is James Talbot , who feared for the dam 's safety and did everything he could to warn his fellow club members . <p> In Sunlight , in a Beautiful Garden ( the title is from Maurice Maeterlinck 's play Pelleas and Melisande ) is not a perfect book . Arguably , Cambor sets too many characters in motion . Some of them - Frick , for example - are underdeveloped , and the bouncing from one narrative strand to another can get a bit hectic . Also , the Nora-Daniel romance via notes strains credulity . How many summers can a teen-age girl carry the torch for a guy she 's never set eyes on ? <p> But it 's a very good novel indeed , and together with Cambor 's first book , The Book of Mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national stature with a most promising future . A former psychiatric nurse who turned to fiction-writing relatively late , she recently resigned as head of the Creative Writing Program at the University of Houston to devote herself full time to her third novel . <p> For its beautifully crafted language and its insights into the human heart , In Sunlight deserves a wide audience . <p> TYPE : - LINKS-  ; Book Review
