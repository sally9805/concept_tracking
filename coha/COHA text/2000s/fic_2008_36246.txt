The ? rst time Han laid eyes on her , standing with Lando on one of Nar Shaddaa 's permacrete landing platforms a few short years before he had thrown in with the Rebel Alliance , he saw the battered old freighter not only for all she was but for all that she might one day become . <br> <br> Staring at her like some lovesick cub . Eyes wide , mouth hanging open . Then quickly trying to get hold of himself so that Lando would n't know what he was thinking . Dismissing the ship as a hunk of junk . But Lando was no fool , and by then he knew all of Han 's tells . One of the best gamblers that side of Coruscant , he knew when he was being bluffed . " She 's fast , " he had said , a twinkle in his eye . <br> <br> Han did n't doubt it . <br> <br> Even that far back it was easy to envy Lando all he already possessed , his extraordinary good fortune to begin with . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't deserve this ship . He could barely handle a skimmer , let alone a light-fast freighter best ? own by a pair of able pilots . He just was n't worthy of her . <br> <br> Han had never thought of himself as the covetous or acquisitive type , but suddenly he wanted the ship more than he had ever wanted anything in his life . After all the years of servitude and wandering , of close calls and failed partnerships , in and out of love , in and out of the Academy , victim of as many tricks as he 'd played on others . . . perhaps he saw the ship as a chance for permanence . <br> <br> Circling her , fairly orbiting her , he nursed sinister designs . The old freighter drew him to her gravity , as she clearly had all who had piloted her and added their own touches to the YT 's hull , mandibles , the varied techno-terrain of her surface . He took the smell of the ship into his nostrils . <br> The closer he looked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ravages of time and of space ? ight . Dents hammered out , cracks ? lled with epoxatal , paint smeared over areas of carbon scoring . <br> Aftermarket parts socked down with inappropriate fasteners or secured by less-than-professional welds . She was rashed with rust , bandaged with strips of durasteel , leaking grease and other lubricants , smudged with crud . She had seen action , this ship , long before Lando 's luck at sabacc had made her his property . But in service to who or what , Han had no idea . Criminals , smugglers , pirates , mercenaries . . . certainly all of those and more . <br> <br> When Lando ? red her up for Han 's inspection , his heart skipped a beat . And minutes later , seated at the controls , savoring the response of the sublight engines , taking her through the paces and nearly frightening Lando to death , he knew he was fated to own her . He would get the Hutts to buy her for him , or pirate her if he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light laser cannons for quads . He 'd plant a retractable repeating blaster in her belly to provide cover ? re for quick get &shy; aways . He 'd install a couple of concussion missile launchers between the boxy forks of her prow . . . <br> <br> Not once did it occur to him that he would win her from Lando . Much less that Lando would lose her on a bluff . <br> Piloting the modi ? ed SoroSuub he and Chewie leased from Lando had only added to his longing for the ship . He imagined her origins and the adventures she had been through . It struck him that he was so accepting of her from the start , he had never asked Lando how or when she had acquired the name Millennium Falcon . <br> Corellian Engineering Corporation <br> Orbital Assembly Facility 7 <br> 60 years Before the Battle of Yavin <br> <br> WITH HIS SHIFT WINDING DOWN , SOLY KANTT 'S GAZE DRIFTED lazily between the chrono display mounted on the wall and a news feed running on the HoloNet . A tie score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and strife among some spacefaring folk known as Mandalorians . A lanky human with a family on Corellia and ten years on the job , Kantt had his soft hands clasped behind his head and his feet raised with ankles crossed on the console that constituted his private domain at CEC , Orbital 7 . A holozine was opened in his lap and a partially ? lled container of cold caf stood with two empties in the chair 's cup holders . Beyond the transparisteel pane that crowned the gleaming monitoring deck moved a steady stream of YT-1300 freighters fresh off the assembly line , though not yet painted , and shepherded by a ? ock of guidance buoys slaved to the facility 's cybernetic overseer . Thirty- ? ve meters long and capable of carrying a hundred metric tons of cargo , the YT had been in production for less than a standard year but had already proved to be an instant classic . Designed with help from Narro Sienar , owner of one of CEC 's chief competitors in the shipbuilding business , the freighter was being marketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative to the steadfast YG-series ships . Where most of CEC 's starship line was regarded as uninspired , the YT &shy; 1300 had a certain utilitarian ? air . What made the ship unique was its saucer-shaped core , to which a wide variety of components could be secured , including an outrigger cockpit and various sensor arrays . Stock , it came loaded with a pair of front mandibles that elongated the hull design , and a new generation of droid brain that supervised the ship 's powerful sublight and hyperspace engines . <br> Kantt had lost track of just how many YTs had drifted past him since he 'd traded glances with Facility 7 's security scanner eight hours earlier , but the number had to be twice what it was last month . Even so , the ship was selling so quickly that production could n't keep pace with demand . Setting his feet on the ? oor , he stretched his arms over his head and was in the midst of a long yawn when the console loosed a strident alarm that jolted him fully awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display screens when a young tech wearing brightly colored coveralls and a comlink headset hurried in from the adjacent station . <br> " Control valve on one of the fuel droids ! " <br> Kantt shot to his feet and leaned across the console for a better view of the line . Off to one side , bathed in the bright glow of a bank of illuminators , one of the YTs had a single fuel droid anchored to its port-side nozzle , where up and down the zero-g alley identical droids had already detached from the rest of the freighters . Kantt whirled around . <br> " Shut the droid down ! " <br> Raised on his toes at a towering control panel , the tech gave his shaved head a shake . " It 's not responding . " <br> " Override the fuel program , Bon ! " <br> " No luck . " <br> Kantt swung back to the transparisteel pane . The droid had n't moved and was probably continuing to pump fuel into YT 492727ZED . A form of liquid metal , the fuel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy from the moment the concept ship had made its appearance . It had nearly been a reason for scuttling the entire line . <br> Kantt dropped his gaze to the console 's monitor screens and gauges . " The YT 's fuel cells are at redline . If we ca n't get that droid to detach before warm-up  --  " <br> " It should be detaching now ! " <br> Kantt all but pressed his face to the cool pane . " It 's away ! But that YT 's going to ? re hot ! " Turning , he ran for the door opposite the one Bon had come through . " Come with me . " <br> Single- ? le , they raced through two observation stations . Third in line was the data-keeping department , and Kantt knew from the instant they burst in that things had gone from bad to worse . Clustered at the viewport , the Dralls who staffed the department were hopping up and down in agitation and chittering to one another without letup , despite efforts by the clan 's Duchess to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small furry bodies for a look outside . The sit &shy; uation was even worse than he feared . The YT had entered the test area for the braking thrusters and attitude jets . Superfueled , the ship had rocketed out of line , knocking aside and stunning a dozen or more gravitic droids responsible for keeping the line in check . As Kantt watched , three more freighters escaped the line . The YT responsible clipped one of them in the stern , sending it into a forward spin . The spinning ship did the same to the one in front of it , but in counter-rotation , so that when the two ships came full circle they locked mandibles and pirouetted as a pair into the curved inner hull of the ob &shy; servation station on the far side of the alley . <br> As the test ? ring sequence continued , the enlivened YT jinked to port then starboard , leapt out of line , then dived below it . Kantt watched only long enough to know that all thoughts of returning to Corellia in time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get home by the weekend . Leaving the Dralls to bicker over how to balance the economic loss , Kantt and the technician stormed into the next station , where a mostly human group of midlevel executives were close to tearing their hair out . To a one , they looked to the newcom &shy; ers for even a scrap of good news . <br> " A droid team is on the way , " Bon said . " No problem . " <br> Kantt gave the tech a quick glance and turned to the execs . " You heard him . No problem . " <br> A red-faced man with shirtsleeves rolled to his elbows glared at him . " You do n't think so ? " His arm shot out , indicating the viewport . " See for yourself . " <br> Kantt had n't moved a muscle when two others grabbed hold of him and tugged him forward . The droid team had in fact arrived on the scene  --  a quartet of Cybot Galactica grapplers , angling for the bucking YT with clasping arms and waldoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fastening to the engine access hatches . And though the line had been shut down , well behind 492727ZED a dozen identical units were heaped together where some of the displaced guidance buoys had ended their drift . Worse , the chain reaction of pileups had sent several fuel droids reeling from their respective freighters , and two of them were on a collision course . <br> Kantt squeezed his eyes shut , but the hellish ? ash that stabbed at his eyelids told him part of the story : one or perhaps both of the droids had exploded . His ears told him the rest , as gouts of molten metal and hunks of alloy began to pepper the transparisteel panel . Alarms blared throughout the monitoring stations , and streams of ? re-suppression foam gushed into the alley from the semicircular structures that de ? ned it . A collective moan of deep distress ? lled the room , and Kantt had a mental image of his bonus evaporating before his eyes . With it went the birthday earrings for his wife , his son 's game deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning , the case of Gizer ale he was ex &shy; pected to supply for the shock-ball ? nals party . <br> Kantt thought for a moment when he opened his eyes that the nightmare was over , or if not , that the explosion had reduced the unruly YT to blackened parts . But not only had the ship avoided the ? restorm and ? ak , it had also managed to weave through the subsequent chaos and was closing fast on the sublight engine test- ? re station . <br> Kantt gave his head a clearing shake and slammed his palm down on the console 's communicator button . " We need a live crew at Alley Four sublight test ? re  --  now ! " <br> Sucking in his breath , he planted his other palm on the console and leaned forward in time to see an emergency sled nose from an up-alley vehicle bay . Little more than an engine surmounted by a cage of vertical and horizontal poles , the sled carried six wranglers out ? tted in yellow EVA suits , helmets , and jetpacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrospanners , and shaped-charge detonators that hung from their belts like weapons . Kantt had a friend on the team , who like the rest lived for emergency situations . But a rogue ship was some &shy; thing entirely new . <br> Initially the sled pilot appeared to be having as much trouble matching the YT 's maneuvers as the grappler droids had had . The freighter 's sudden jukes and twists owed to nothing more than inter &shy; mittent ? rings of the thrusters and attitude jets , but there were mo &shy; ments when the maneuvers struck Kantt as inspired . As if the ship were taking evasive action or in a race to reach the sublight engine test sta &shy; tion ahead of its more compliant ilk . <br> Dire thoughts edged into Kantt 's mind of what might happen if the ship could n't be reined in by then . Would the overfueled YT burn itself to a cinder ? Detonate , taking the entire alley with it ? Open a vacuum breach in the facility and launch for the stars ? <br> Gradually , the sled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to bring the skeletal vehicle alongside the YT . Rocketing from the sled , the wranglers alighted on the freighter , anchoring themselves to places on the hull with magclamps and suction holdfasts . Raised up on its stern like some unbroken acklay in a creature show , the YT refused to surrender any of its determination to shake them off . But slow and consistent effort allowed one of the wranglers to reach the dorsal hull access hatch and disappear into the ship . When he did , the execs hooted a cheer Kantt prayed was n't premature . <br> Only when the ship quieted did he realize that he had been holding his breath , and he let it out with a long , plosive exhale , wiping sweat from his brow on the sleeve of his shirt . The cheering gave way to relieved backslapping and rapid exchanges as to how to get the line moving again . With waiting lists for the YT growing longer every day , production would have to be increased . Vacation leaves would have to be canceled . Overtime would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> " Born of ? re , " the tech said as they were passing through the Dralls ' station . " That YT , " he added when Kantt glanced at him . " A hero 's birth if I ever witnessed one . When has that happened ? " <br> Kantt made a face . " It 's a freighter , Bon . One of a hundred million . " <br> Bon grinned . " If you ask me , more like one in a hundred million . " <br> Coruscant <br> During the battle of Coruscant , <br> 19 years before the battle of Yavin <br> <br> " YOU GOT TA LOVE THIS SHIP , " REEZE SAID . " She knows her job , all right . " <br> Jadak slipped the freighter in between a Corellian transport and a Santhe/Sienar passenger ship , then stood YT 492727ZED on her side to ease past the transport and continue to maneuver toward the front of the pack . Reeze muted the cockpit 's enunciators so they would n't have to listen to the pilots and navigators who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us ownership after this run . " <br> " We can hope , " Jadak said . <br> " Ten years of sticking our necks out , Tobb . There should be a law . " " There should be , but there is n't . Besides , I 'm just trying to help keep the galaxy on course . What 's your excuse ? " " Like I told you , I want this ship to be ours . " <br> Both pilots were human , Jadak a bit taller and twenty years younger , with a lighter complexion and a clipped beard that accented a square jaw . Reeze was graying at the temples but clear-eyed and as ? t as an athlete . A traf ? c jam was the last thing they had expected to encounter at Coruscant , but the Separatists ' attack on the galactic capital had come so unexpectedly that nearly everyone inbound had been caught up in it . Some had arrived in time to hear the HoloNet announcement of Chancellor Palpatine 's abduction and witness the re &shy; version to realspace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleet . Together with the Home Fleet crusiers , the huge Venator &shy; class ships had succeeded in keeping the battle con ? ned to the upper reaches of Coruscant 's envelope . A few deft pilots had managed to spin their ships out of the fray and jump back into hyperspace . But tens of thousands of other vessels  --  ships of all sizes and makes and purposes  --  were still holding at the forward line , waiting for the battle to end one way or another , so that they could either continue on to Coruscant or ? ee for the Outer Rim . <br> " Even if they did , " Jadak went on , " how could we afford to keep her running ? " <br> " Same as we 've been doing . But for the private sector . " <br> " Gainful employment ? " <br> " I 'll settle for employment . I 'm not as particular as you . " <br> Jadak frowned . " I 've known too many smugglers . That life 's not what it 's cracked up to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this one . " <br> Jadak had brought the YT to a point where they had a panoramic view of the ? ghting . More slugfest than coordinated battle , the clash pitted the big ships against one another , crimson hyphens of annihilation pulsing among them while ? ights of ARC-170 , droid tri ? ghters , and vulture ? ghters buzzed about in seeming pandemonium . The melee 's backdrop was perpetually lighted Coruscant itself , the planet 's scintillating urban rings ravaged in places where defensive shields had been breached or ships had gone to ground . The Republic with everything on the line , and Count Dooku 's Confederacy of Independent Systems with nothing more to lose than a cyborg general and an army of droids . <br> Reeze whistled in surprise . " Front seat on the fall of civilization as we know it . " <br> " Not likely . But all the more reason to deliver our cargo . " <br> " So you say . " Reeze gazed out the YT 's circular viewport . " I see a problem in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , actually , and the words laser cannon ? gure into all of them . " <br> Jadak swiveled his chair . " We ca n't be late , Reeze . They said it 's important . " <br> Reeze returned a glum nod . " Late being the operative word . As in the late Reeze Duurmun . " <br> " I 'll tell everyone you died a hero . " <br> " What  --  you 'll survive ? " Reeze stared at his friend , then laughed . " Yeah . You probably will . " <br> Jadak swung forward . " See what you can pick up on the battle net . " <br> Reeze tugged the headset over his ears and keyed a coded entry into the communications suite . He listened to the comm chatter for a moment , then craned his neck to study something off to starboard and brought a new view of the battle to one of the instrument panel display screens . He tapped his fore ? nger against the screen to indicate the icon pro ? le of a large battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? yout bridge . <br> Jadak read the alphanumeric data beneath the icon . " What am I looking at ? " <br> " The Invisible Hand . " <br> " General Grievous 's ? agship . " <br> " That 's where they were holding Palpatine . " <br> " Were ? " <br> " The Jedi rescued him . Kenobi and Skywalker . But the three of them are still on board . " <br> Jadak took the YT through a quick spin to improve the view . In the middle distance , a Republic Cruiser was hammering away at the Invisible Hand ' s waist , where its elongated prow met a bulbous aft section . Maybe in retaliation for what the Republic ship had endured from the Invisible Hand ' s ? ak arrays . Jadak glanced at the monitor . <br> " Looks like the captain of the Guarlara did n't get word that the Chancellor 's onboard . " <br> " Could be because of signal jamming . Or maybe he just does n't care . " <br> Jadak scowled . " Palpatine 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> For several moments , the two men watched in silence as the Guar &shy; lara subjected the Separatist ? agship to repeated laser cannon broad &shy; sides , blowing gaping holes in the hull and igniting ? ery explosions that swept through the Invisible Hand stem to stern . Jadak could n't imagine the cybernetic Grievous surviving the onslaught , let alone Pal-patine and his saviors , the force or no . When the ? agship could endure no more , it listed , then fell victim to gravity and began a slow descent into Coruscant 's atmosphere . <br> " She 's dirt-bound , " Jadak said . <br> " And already coming apart . Two to one she wo n't make it halfway . " <br> " I 'll take that bet . " <br> With one hand clamped on the control yoke , Jadak tweaked the inertial compensator and shot the YT forward . No one tried to prevent them from plunging into the heart of the maelstrom . If they were hell bent on becoming just another battle casualty , it was their business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , " Reeze said , one hand clamped to the chair 's armrest . <br> Jadak countered it with a shake of his head . " The Seps have the rest of the planet blockaded . Our best shot 's here , with the Invisible Hand breaking trail . " <br> Reeze shot Jadak a look . " We 're following her down ? " <br> " Let 's say , in . " <br> Reeze nodded . " I 'm good with in . " <br> " Even if it means losing the bet ? " <br> " Even if . " <br> If they were to ride the Invisible Hand ' s wake to the surface , ? rst they had to reach her . That meant threading a path among the countless frigates and gunboats that stood in the way , dodging the ? ghters that continued to spill from the bellies of the KDY carriers and the curving arms of the Neimoidians ' behemoth Lucrehulks , and avoiding the tur &shy; bolaser ? re that crosshatched near space . But they did n't doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task . The ship had never let them down , and there was no reason to think she would fail them now . <br> An unknown quantity to the friend-or-foe interrogators of the warships they streaked past , the YT became a target of opportunity for one and all . Absent weapons of their own , Jadak and Reeze had to rely on the freighter 's remarkable speed and near-preternatural agility . They pushed the ship for all she was worth , corkscrewing through churning clouds of ? ghter dog ? ghts and executing twists and turns better left to Jedi Interceptors than forty-year-old light freighters  --  even one as upgraded and enhanced as the YT was . Power that was n't being consumed by the YT 's sublight engine was being gobbled up by the de ? ector shields , taxed by each glancing bolt the ship sustained . <br> Leaping out from behind one of Coruscant 's crazed orbital mirrors , they raced to fall in behind the ? aming deteriorating hulk the Separatist ? agship had become , her blunt bow dipped toward Coruscant in a gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armor like a monar serpent shedding scales . <br> " Cruiser 's escape pods are away , " Reeze said . <br> Jadak magni ? ed the forward view of the ship . Hands vised on the yoke as the YT slalomed through a fragment cloud of parts and components , Jadak watched in awe as the warship altered vector for the planet 's governmental district . The Invisible Hand was falling to be sure , but it was clear that someone still had the helm and was determined to guide the vessel in by deploying the drag ? ns and using the exterior hatches as needed to keep the ship from burning up in the at &shy; mosphere . <br> " Skywalker ? " Reeze said . <br> " I doubt it 's Palpatine  --  unless he 's got talents he has n't revealed . " <br> Hundreds of warships too large to be annihilated by Coruscant 's artillery and rocketry had penetrated the umbrella and cratered the urbanscape . But it was obvious that the standoff gunnery crews had been ordered to allow the Invisible Hand through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planetfall . All they had to do was remain close enough to the ship not to be spotted , but far enough from it not to be incinerated . <br> Jadak had his hand on the throttle when the entire aft portion of the Invisible Hand tumbled away in a mass of ? aming wreckage . Only Reeze 's last-moment evasive actions kept the YT from being atomized . Just as quickly , Jadak brought the freighter up on her side and barrel-rolling out of harm 's way . But the hail of debris that slammed into the shields was worse than anything they had ? own through earlier , and the de ? ectors might as well have yowled for all the alert tones the instrument panel issued . <br> Without warning , the YT veered sharply . Only the copilot chair 's safety harness kept Reeze from landing in Jadak 's lap . Status indicators ? ashed on the console , and another chorus of alarms ? lled the cockpit . <br> " Port braking thruster 's taken a bad hit , " Jadak said as he brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out when we set down . " <br> Reeze snugged the harness . " The eternal optimist . " <br> " Someone in this cockpit 's got ta be . " <br> With half of the warship 's mass lost to space , whoever had the con &shy; trols was managing to keep the truncated forward portion on track for a controlled crash , probably on one of the old hardened landing strips in the government district . Repulsors howling , the YT continued to follow it down , shedding altitude and velocity . But with only twenty kilometers to go , icons began to paint the threat screen and proximity alarms wailed . Jadak saw ? ights of ships screaming up the well to render aid to the Invisible Hand . <br> <br> " Fireships , " Reeze said . " Couple of clone ? ghters , too . " <br> " Time to make ourselves scarce . " <br> " We 've got that authorization code  --  " <br> " Better save it for when we really need it . Switch us over to terrain-following . " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> Jadak consulted the topographic display then banked out of the warship 's wake , main thrusters protesting and intense waves of heat as &shy; saulting them . Two of the clone ? ghters gave chase but ultimately peeled away to rejoin the Invisible Hand , which was fast approaching the landing strip . <br> The YT slewed west over the spaceport tower and the Jedi Temple , then out over The Works , through columns of oily black smoke billowing from crash craters and ? res that had spread into some of the outlying districts . <br> " Looks like the alien sectors took the brunt of it , " Reeze said . <br> " A lot of folks have been trying to get rid of those slums for decades . " <br> " Grievous in league with the urban renewal lobbyists ? " <br> " Why not ? " <br> Jadak had never seen the striated airlanes so empty . But in among the emergency vehicles and police cruisers were clone-piloted ARC &shy; 170s on the prowl for intruders until martial law was lifted . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ? ghters had taken an in &shy; terest in the freighter . <br> " About twenty gun emplacements have us in target lock , " Reeze said . <br> " Open the comm . " <br> " YT-Thirteen-hundred , " someone said over the subspace comm . " Identify yourself and state your destination . " <br> " Stellar Envoy out of Ralltiir , " Jadak said toward the microphone . " Destination is the Senate Annex . " <br> " The Senate is restricted airspace . If you 've an authorization code , transmit it now , or turn about . Failure to comply will be met with lethal force . " <br> Jadak nodded to Reeze . " Go ahead . " <br> Reeze swiveled his chair and punched a code into the comm board . <br> " Transmitting authorization . " <br> " Stellar Envoy , " the same voice said a moment later , " you are cleared for the Senate Building . " <br> Continues ...                   @ @
