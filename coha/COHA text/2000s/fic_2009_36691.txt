The Crying Tree <br> Naseem Rakha <br> C H A P T E R 1 <br> October 1 , 2004 <br> THE DEATH WARRANT ARRIVED THAT morning , packaged in a large white envelope marked confidential and addressed to Tab Mason , Superintendent , Oregon State Penitentiary . Mason had been warned the order might be coming . A couple of weeks earlier , the Crook County DA had let the word slip that after nineteen years on death row , condemned murderer Daniel Joseph Robbin had stopped his appeals . <br> Mason dropped the envelope on his desk , along with a file about as thick as his fist , then ran his hand over the top of his cleanly shaved skull . He 'd been in corrections for twenty years  --  Illinois , Louisiana , Florida  --  and on execution detail a half- dozen occasions , but he 'd never been in charge of the actual procedure . Those other times he 'd simply walked the guy into the room , strapped him down , opened the blinds on the witness booth , then stood back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida who 'd done the job fifty times . " It becomes routine , " the officer told Mason , who was busy puking into a trash can after witnessing his fi rst execution . <br> Now Mason slid into his chair , flicked on his desk lamp , and opened Robbin 's file . There was the man 's picture . A front and side shot . He had been nineteen years old when he was booked , had long scraggly hair and eyes squinted to a hostile slit . Mason turned the page and began to read . On the afternoon of May 6 , 1985 , Daniel Joseph <br> Robbin beat , then shot fifteen-year-old Steven Joseph Stanley ( aka " Shep " ) while in the process of robbing the boy 's home at 111 Indian Ridge Lane . The victim was found still alive by his father , Deputy Sheriff Nathaniel Patrick Stanley , but died before medical <br> assistance could arrive . The remaining family members  --  wife and mother , Irene Lucinda Stanley , and twelve-year-old Barbara Lee ( aka Bliss )  --  were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were originally from Illinois , had been living in Oregon for a year and a half when the incident occurred . <br> The superintendent leafed through more pages  --  court documents , letters , photos  --  then leaned back in his chair and looked out his window . A squat rectangular building sat on its own toward the north end of the prison 's twenty-five-acre grounds . The last time someone had been executed out there was seven- plus years ago . Mason had been working his way up through the ranks at the Florida State Prison out of Raiford , aspiring for a job like the one he had now  --  head of a large correctional institution , good salary , power . He blew out a long , disgusted breath . Why now ? The Oregon penitentiary was way overcrowded , inmates doubled up in their cells , half of them out of their minds ; fights were breaking out left and right , gangs getting tougher to handle ; there were race issues , drugs  --  all while funding for counseling and rehab continued to get slashed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warrant . The execution was scheduled for October 29 , 12:01 A.M. <br> " Less than a goddamn month , " he said , shaking his head . Then , as if to rouse himself , he clapped his mismatched hands , one as dark as the rest of his black skin , one strangely , almost grotesquely white . There was no complaining in this job , he told himself . No moaning about what needed to be done . No stammering or stuttering or <br> doing anything that might show the slightest bit of resistance or hesitancy . No . Everything in his career had been leading him to this kind of challenge : his demeanor , his words , his actions would all set a tone . And he knew exactly what that tone had to be . <br> <br> <br> Continues ...
