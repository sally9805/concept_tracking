PLAGUED BY PILES OF PRESCHOOL ARTWORK ? GUILTY OVER GAPS IN THE BABY BOOK ? STOP FRETTING AND START ORGANIZING . CATHIE KRYCZKA SHOWS YOU HOW // THERE 'S A HAIDA CANOE in my dining room and a medieval hut ... and a great big molecule ( OK , they 're cardboard models ) . In the basement there are baby shoes and ballet slippers , book reports and dictes . And in the closets upstairs ... it 's just too frightening for a family magazine . These are the treasured mementos of my kids ' growing up years . And they 're taking over my house . At first it seems possible - even vital - to preserve every object that might bear your child 's DNA . But soon you realize there is n't a house big enough to store everything , or a day long enough to get it all organized . Susan Gregus of Burlington , Ont. , mother of Jack , four , and Julia , two , has a balanced perspective : " I 'm sentimental , but I 'm also realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a simple step-by-step method to keep ahead of the growing mountain of memorabilia . STASH IT All you need is a box . Professional organizer Valerie Hanson , owner of Tips , Tools and Techniques in Halifax , suggests a plastic container - even something from the dollar store ( plastic is less dusty than cardboard ) . Label it and keep it under your child 's bed , in the kitchen - somewhere handy . As those reams of worksheets , scribblings and art materialize , just date each item . If it is n't obvious , write a word of description on the back . And dump it in . See , that was easy ! CULL IT Annually - perhaps at the start of summer holidays if your kids are school-aged , or on some rainy day ( not today ! ) - take a couple of hours to go through the box and decide what to keep and what to toss . Hanson offers this tip : " Look at it from your children 's point of view 20 , 30 or 40 years down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it the colouring books that they just filled up ? Or is it the little story they wrote when they were home sick with chicken pox ? " ( And because this is about your children 's memories , not yours , Hanson suggests that as soon as they 're able , they help make the decisions . You can help by suggesting a limit of 15 or so keepers . ) You 've done a fast sort and everything you are n't keeping is gone . You can start over with a cleared-out box , ready for the next onslaught . Whew ! PRESERVE IT Now you 're left with a handful of special things . They can go into a Rubbermaid bin , a banker 's box from the office supply store , or a decorative storage container for permanent safekeeping . As you put things into this box , check that they have names and dates . Professional organizer Estelle Gee , director of Orderly Lives in Toronto , says , " I ca n't stress enough how memory plays havoc with you as you get older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you will . " DO N'T LET IT INTIMIDATE YOU If you 're a little behind ( say , 10 or 13 years ) how do you begin ? " Start with today , with what is most current , " says Gee . " Then gradually over the months , go through things and put them all in a box or two . " If you start with the baby mementos , you 'll feel like you can never catch up ; getting the current stuff under control first will give you a sense of progress . LET YOUR CHILD DO IT Scrapbooks are fine if you have the time and resources . But think about delegating : Get an old-fashioned scrapbook with black pages , Hanson suggests , and let your child express himself . If he 's printing , he can write a story , record who his best friends are , and paste in special artwork or souvenirs . It 's a great project to pull out on a " nothin " to do " day . Encourage your child to work at it whenever inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT OFF As long as you 've dated items and they 're in a safe place , there 's no rush to organize them . Gee 's mother ( who is 80 ) is now sorting through old photos and putting them into beautiful albums . And while Gee does n't recommend waiting quite that long , for families so busy they hardly have time to blink , it makes sense to put off the big sort ... maybe even until you 're retired . " Then you 'll have that incredible luxury of time . When your kids are little , you do n't have that . " ENJOY IT After everything is stored , get it out once in a while and rediscover it together . Even very young children love to know what they were like when they were little - they 'll get a kick out of seeing how tiny their baby socks were . As they grow older , those mementos become more precious . Hanson and her daughter , Laura , away at university now , have had hours of enjoyment reminiscing over the keepsakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy childhood .

Sidebar Photo Finish Photos of your child growing up are irreplaceable . You 'll want to keep them in top shape - while keeping it simple . John McElhone , a photo conservator at the National Gallery of Canada , offers these suggestions : * A plastic container like Tupperware will keep photos dust-free . Stabilize the humidity by adding a piece of high-quality paper or cardboard from an art supply store . Cardboard photo storage boxes are fine too - they 'll protect against dust , humidity fluctuations and pollutants - as long as they 're good quality . It 's OK to leave pictures in the envelopes they come in from the processor . Store the box in a closet with no exterior walls , and avoid the attic and basement where there are extremes of temperature and moisture . * There 's no way around this step : Write the name , date and occasion on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are meaningless if no one remembers who 's in them - and that can happen over one generation ( sooner if your children look alike ) . McElhone recommends using a Pigma Pen from an art supply store - it wo n't damage photos like a pencil or ballpoint will . * If you can manage , put together an album . Look for a high-quality book with good paper , or slide your photos into an album with plastic sleeves - adding a sheet of that quality paper in each sleeve will help control humidity . Just be sure the plastic is n't polyvinyl chloride - PVC . Avoid magnetic albums ( sometimes called self-stick ) ; they 'll destroy your photos in no time . Best advice ? Buy from a reputable photo or art supply store and ask for recommendations from the staff . And no need to include all 43 takes of Brianna opening her first birthday present . McElhone says , " From a family celebration , you need one photograph that will really capture the spirit of the day . " * If you 're using digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your hard drive is the most stable way to keep an image file , so have a copy there . Be sure to back them up on DVD or CD too . And make prints of any you love . * Display them ! Make copies of your favourites ( sunlight fades photos ) and put them out . You want the world to see those beautiful smiling faces ! // <p>
