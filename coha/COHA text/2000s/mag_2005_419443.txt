Food , family , and good times around the grill Photograph Fourteen-year-old Sara , with a platter of foil-wrapped sweet potatoes , joins mom and sister Caitlin for Sunday dinner outdoors . // The busier life gets , the more I value the refuge of Sunday dinner . It 's just my husband , my daughters , and I around the table , touching base before the week takes us in different directions and our evening routine becomes speed eating or calling for take-out pizza . Sunday is my day for relaxed cooking , for putting on my decades-old apron and enjoying a glass of Chardonnay while I make dinner . On Sundays I 'm drawn to nostalgic entres , like pot roast with potatoes , but since traditional fare like this runs the risk of being bland , I always add a little twist . The only other given is an irresistible aroma to lure my girls to the kitchen for conversation long before the meal is ready .

In summer they like a gigantic Caesar salad , with garlicky homemade croutons and spicy prawns . Other times we 'll grill marinated tri-tip alongside mixed peppers , squash , and asparagus . One of the simple joys of September I cherish most is that feeling of holding on to summer that comes from grilling and eating out in the backyard . If I had to pick the perfect Sunday dinner in September for my family , this one from associate Food editor Amy Traverso would do easily . It starts with beautifully simple crudits and an avocado-mint dipping sauce my daughters love . The classic roast chicken moves onto the grill , with a spice rub to give it extra kick . For a clever , casual side dish , Amy packed sweet potatoes and onions into foil packets bursting with flavor . And if you really want to show off ( and get your family to stick around longer ) , finish the meal with Amy 's old-fashioned apple crisp- " baked " right on the grill .
