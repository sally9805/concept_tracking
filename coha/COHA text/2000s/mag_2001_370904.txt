A living cell bustles with molecular activity . Lilliputian protein motors ferry goods and services . Enzymes curl and unfurl . Even on its calmest days , the DNA double-helix twists , unwinds and wiggles like a loopy spring . <P> Breaking this molecular hullabaloo into its elemental physical forces is Carlos Bustamante 's specialty . Bustamante , 50 , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of California , Berkeley , came to the U.S. from Peru 26 years ago as a Fulbright scholar . In the early 1990s , while at the University of Oregon , he and his colleagues tacked one end of a DNA molecule to a magnetic bead and measured its elasticity by tugging at the bead with magnets . A stroke of genius , no doubt , but to what end ? " We did n't quite know how to answer that question at the time , " admits Bustamante . " We did it because nobody had done it before . And it was fun . " <P> Good thing they did . The experiment established that large molecules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Robert Tjian , Bustamante 's colleague at Berkeley , " we all studied complex molecular machines as populations  --  what we call bucket biochemistry . " The approach has its uses , but it reveals little about how the machines work or what forces they can generate . <P> Using an atomic force microscope and a quaint gadget called the laser tweezer , Bustamante found a way around such limits . The microscope reads the topography of molecules by trailing a fine needle over their surfaces  --  much as a phonograph reads the grooves of a record . Coat the needle with an appropriate chemical , however , and you convert it into a grapple for manipulating molecules . Laser tweezers , meanwhile , trap molecules and particles in a tightly focused beam of light . Move the beam and you move the object . <P> Bustamante had refined his techniques sufficiently by 1997 to grasp a single protein and , applying forces only a trillionth as strong as those the earth exerts on an apple , pull it apart like molecular Velcro . Why bother ? To study how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a matter of considerable interest to drug designers , who tailor molecules to monkey-wrench the proteins that make us sick . <P> But Bustamante is n't just interested in tearing molecules apart . Last year he applied the lessons he learned in the early 1990s to describe , step by step , how a lone enzyme copies a DNA sequence into RNA . Even identical enzymes , he found , often work differently  --  some dawdle and abandon their duties , while others go about their business with a bluster . Routine biochemistry would have glossed over such details . " Carlos , " says Tjian , " has taken us to the next level . " <P> It is the frisson of such discoveries that motivates Bustamante . " Being a scientist means living on the borderline between your competence and your incompetence , " he says . " If you always feel competent , you are n't doing your job . "
