<p> Americans are hungry for community . Those of us who live in medium-to-large cities barely know our neighbors . But we may form , at least , the semblance of community in our churches or clubs or even in our workplaces with those who are like-minded . TV sometimes reflects that sense of fellowship in workplace dramas like " NYPD Blue " and comedies like " Ally McBeal . " But then , there are those shows set in small towns populated with eccentric , lovable folks . " Northern Exposure , " surely one of the best of the community-of-eccentrics genre , certainly seemed Capraesque in its regard for individuality , kindness , social responsibility , and pulling together when the chips were down . Three new shows this season - " That 's Life " ( CBS , Saturdays , 8-9 p.m . ) , " Gilmore Girls " ( The WB , Thursdays , 8-9 p.m. ) , and " Ed " ( NBC , Sundays , 8-9 p.m. ) - join NBC 's " Providence " ( Fridays , 8-9 p.m. ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative , as well as social lives . In That 's Life , the community is Italian-American - the only TV show that depicts ordinary , working-class Italian-Americans who are not involved in the mafia . Thirty-something Lydia DeLucca ( Heather Paige Kent ) dumps her demanding , insensitive , but family-approved fianc and goes back to college . Her parents do n't understand this peculiar decision . Her dad ( Paul Sorvino ) thinks she should go to church if she wants to find herself , and her mom ( Ellen Burstyn ) just wants grandchildren . But through it all , family and friends - who form a kind of small town within a big city in New Jersey - secretly approve of her plans even when they openly complain . Her ethnic background seems to guard her in her workplace and from the arrogance of her professor . Family is a bit more oppressive in Gilmore Girls . Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) was only 16 when her daughter Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) was born . The two are as much girlfriends as they are mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brainy daughter and hope to win her over to their highbrow way of life . From the coffee shop called " Hardware Store " to the fancy inn Lorelai manages , little Stars Hollow , Conn. is peopled by decent folk . Writer/producer Amy Sherman-Palladino promises that the inn will have a growing role in the series . In fact , when she first pitched the concept about a mother and daughter who are best friends , she says , she went to stay in a Connecticut inn to think it through . And that 's where the whole story fell into place . " I grew up in the San Fernando Valley , and it 's not like a real city , " she said in a recent interview . " We never talked to our neighbors . I never grew up with community - and that idea is so charming to me , that I wanted Lorelai to have sought out a community where Rory could grow up protected and free ...

The town , she says , is so close-knit that everyone who lives in it is expected to fully engage in every holiday celebration - from bell-ringing to caroling . Over the course of the show , we 'll get to know the town folks and the neighbors ( Sally Struthers among them ) . " The town has a personality , " she says . " The characters walk from store to store , or to school which is across the street from the library which is across the street from the coffee shop and the courthouse . It makes it richer for the characters because they have all these little outlets and people who know them . " I do n't know if I 'd even like to live in a small community , " she adds . " I only know , it sounds warm and rich and colorful and safe . " In this fast-paced day and age , how realistic is the concept of a tight-knit community ?

" She layers community upon community in her series : There are the grandparents Gilmore , the inn and the town , and then there 's Rory 's new private school . The competition to get into Harvard from there is really tough . " Rory is very comfortable in her mother 's world , " she says , " as opposed to the teenage world . Now she is thrown in with kids who will kill you if you throw the curve off . " Rory 's school experience offers a vivid contrast to what Stars Hollow represents , just as the elder grandparents offer a contrast to Lorelai 's brand of mothering .

New York lawyer Ed ( Thomas Cavanagh ) loses his job and his wife in one really bad day , and decides to go home to Stuckeyville for a visit . But so enamored of his high school crush is he , he up and buys a bowling alley and settles down in his hometown hoping to win that girl of his adolescent dreams . " Ed " is shot in a small New Jersey town that closely resembles its creator 's own hometown . " I think we all long for that time in our lives when we had our families and our friends , and did have a community , " says Rob Burnett . " It 's a way for me and Jon Beckerman to experience some of those things again ... " " I do love living in New York , but I absolutely miss that community , " he says .

" We 're shooting a story right now about Ed throwing a Thanksgiving party in the bowling alley for all his friends , trying to recreate a tradition ... , " Burnett says . " But traditions are not easy to come by and it takes time ... There are issues of friendship , loyalty , and forgiveness , the terror and exhilaration of a clean slate . " The media has fragmented community , he says , " and that has had a huge impact on all our lives . With the Internet and dozens of channels to choose from , we are having fewer shared experiences . " With the Internet , we do n't even have to go shopping , we do n't need to be with other people ... " Burnett says that " Ed " is not cynical by design . " All good comedy and drama comes from the same place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't get it .

" I think the community is idealized a little bit ... , " he says , " an idealized version of the way you think things should be . " Ed is the best version of a guy like this . But Stuckeyville is a nice gentle place that I hope people will want to visit once a week . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2000 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
