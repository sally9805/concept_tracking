<p> Even blank cartridges for a starter 's pistol were not to be used extravagantly at the national track and field championships here in one of the world 's poorest nations . Until the concluding session of the five-day meet Saturday , races began with an official standing behind the runners , where they could not see him , holding a flag aloft and yelling , " Go . " <p> Sometimes the competitors heard the command . Frequently , they did not or grew uncertain , starting , stopping and starting again . False starts were declared regularly . <p> Ethiopia 's national stadium lacks a working scoreboard , sophisticated timing devices , computerized results and starting blocks for each of the eight lanes . Competitors shared one javelin and one unyielding pole in the pole vault ; the winning jump fell a quarter-inch short of 11 feet  --  more than nine feet short of the world record . <p> A number of athletes wore no shoes , and many had never before run on the stadium 's rubberized track , the only all-weather oval in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expertise , though , did not dampen the celebratory mood . Distance running is the specialty here , not sprints and field events . As the competition ended , some of the world 's most breathtaking runners circled the worn track , while a band played in the infield . Spectators crowded into the stadium , and younger competitors from the country 's 11 regions applauded , sang and danced in the grandstand . <p> Despite having fewer elite runners and paltry resources , Ethiopia has outstripped its East African neighbor Kenya as the greatest distance-running country at major international competitions . The reasons include a desire to escape poverty , a temperate climate and high altitude , and the tight control exerted by the government on runners ' trips out of the country . The result is that while Kenyans continue to dominate individual marathons in places like New York City and Boston , the Ethiopians have begun winning more team medals at the Olympics and at world track championships . At the world cross-country championships in March , Ethiopia staggered its opponents by winning 14 of 18 available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Athens in August . <p> " We do n't need a starter 's gun , " said Haile Gebrselassie , a two-time men 's Olympic champion at 10,000 meters ( 6.2 miles ) , who has set 17 world records and is considered by many the most versatile runner in history . " Guns are only for fighting . " <p> Socially Responsible <p> Beyond sport , Gebrselassie and several of the other top Ethiopian stars appear to have a strong sense of social responsibility . They participate in H.I.V./AIDS awareness programs , invest in schools and business enterprises and even affect the way the roles of women are perceived . The runners represent a fierce national pride in Ethiopia . <p> These stars also provide the most visible examples of achievement in a nation considered among the four poorest in the world , where the gross domestic product is $110 per capita , and the backbone of the economy , subsistence farming , is vulnerable to cycles of drought and famine . A mural of Gebrselassie on a building near the stadium exhorts , " You can . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have made it in life , " Brook Hailu , Ethiopia 's deputy ambassador to the United States , said in a telephone interview . " Most of them are on a sound financial basis . They are positively engaged in investment and trade activities . Our image in the 70 's and 80 's was down the drain , synonymous with poverty and drought . Now they play a role in giving us a good positive image . " <p> When Ethiopia 's small team of 26 runners returned home from the Olympics in Sydney , Australia , with eight medals , including four golds , an estimated one million people greeted them here in the capital during a jubilant parade from the airport . <p> The social event of last summer in Addis Ababa was the June wedding of the reigning men 's Olympic marathon champion , Gezahegne Abera , to Elfenesh Alemu , who finished second in the women 's race at the Boston Marathon last month . <p> The wedding was at the national stadium , and the train on the bride 's dress circled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The event also served to raise awareness in a country where 2.2 million people suffer from H.I.V. , the virus that causes AIDS , or from full-blown AIDS , and where one million children have been orphaned by the disease , government officials said . According to the United Nations , two-thirds of the Addis Ababa residents who die between the ages of 20 and 54 succumb to AIDS-related illnesses . <p> The bride 's train was printed with red AIDS ribbons and was sectioned into 250 pieces that were signed by the V.I.P. guests with safe-sex pledges . The pieces were then handed out to schoolchildren for display in classrooms . <p> " We wanted to help young people and students be aware of the epidemic in this part of the world , " Abera said . " We know we have problems in Ethiopia , and we take it as our responsibility to help whatever problems we are facing . " <p> He and his wife have also contributed money to AIDS orphans and to famine relief efforts . Derartu Tulu , the two-time Olympic champion at 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built a hotel in the Arsi region south of here and has invested in a sorghum and wheat farm . Gebrselassie has built two elementary schools outside of Addis Ababa and has constructed two office buildings in the capital , one of which includes a cafe , cinema and health club . <p> Many African runners experience an anonymous brilliance in the West . They are so great and numerous that they can be perceived as interchangeable , faceless . Gebrselassie , 32 , has transcended this obscurity with his rarefied skill , charisma and openness . He has become fluent in English and has used his stature and sense of accountability to take a visible role in social policy . He is perhaps the country 's most popular person , and with an income that reaches $1 million a year in prize money and endorsements , one of the richest . <p> In recent days , Gebrselassie has moved into a palatial home in the hills above Addis Ababa , with marble floors , a swimming pool and Italian fixtures . The house is surrounded by high walls and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wealthy neighborhood , just above other houses made of mud or corrugated tin . <p> Gebrselassie , his wife , Alem , and their three daughters could easily afford a life of splendid isolation , but he employs 260 people in his real estate company and other endeavors . He plans to build more schools and has begun campaigning for higher prices for coffee , Ethiopia 's main export , while also seeking to expand European markets for teff , the indigenous grain . His country faces a bleak future if more than half the population remains illiterate and AIDS expands in dispiriting numbers , Gebrselassie said . <p> " When I help people , I help myself , " he said . " I ca n't change a country as a single person , but I have to do my part . " <p> A Political Future ? <p> He may seek political office after he retires , Gebrselassie said , and some believe that he could one day become Ethiopia 's president . Perhaps not , he said , because people have only a fleeting interest in athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to change . <p> " Maybe if I become president , the next morning everyone will start to blame Haile Gebrselassie , " he said , speaking of himself in the third person . " I will tell everyone they have to work and go to school . If one will not work , he will be a criminal . " <p> Gebrselassie 's own success has become a contagion , inspiring other runners just as his athletic forebears once motivated him . Abebe Bikila won Ethiopia 's and Africa 's first Olympic gold medal when he finished first in the marathon as he ran barefoot through Rome at the 1960 Olympics . Bikila won the marathon again at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics , and his countryman Mamo Wolde won the event at the 1968 Games in Mexico City . Gebrselassie listened on the radio as Miruts Yifter won the 5,000 meters ( 3.1 miles ) and 10,000 meters at the Moscow Games in 1980 . <p> When Gebrselassie and Tulu won the men 's and women 's 10,000 meters at the 2000 Games in Sydney , a teenager named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arsi region in the southern highlands , where his heroes had also grown up . He was not a serious runner then , but a teacher told him he had talent . <p> " I was so happy that they won the Olympics for Ethiopia , " Bekele said . " I thought , maybe for the future , I 'd like to try running . " <p> Now , at 21 , he has become a multiple winner of the world cross-country championships . And last summer , he defeated his idol , Gebrselassie , to win the 10,000 meters at the world track championships in Paris . <p> Olympic victories for Ethiopia have also carried social implications . When Tulu was a girl in the village of Bekoji , her mother discouraged her from running . It was taboo for a girl to turn in her skirt for a pair of shorts , Tulu said . <p> " She did n't want people to say that her daughter had gone crazy , " Tulu said . <p> But the daughter persisted , and when Tulu won the 10,000 meters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she became the first black African woman to capture a gold medal . After giving birth to a daughter , Tulu again won the 10,000 at the 2000 Olympics . She could win a third time in Athens . <p> Now , she said , " it is no problem " for women in her village to become runners . Another woman from Bekoji , Fatuma Roba , won the marathon at the 1996 Games in Atlanta . Two younger cousins of Tulu 's , Tirunesh and Ejigayehu Dibaba , are expected to challenge for Olympic medals this summer . <p> A shrine to Tulu 's victory in Barcelona sits outside the national stadium . While younger runners are inspired by her , Tulu and others said , women in the larger Ethiopian society , often marginalized , have also gained resolve from her accomplishments . <p> " There are people in Ethiopia working for respect of women 's rights , " Tulu said . " I ca n't say that my success has helped them , but it has helped women to fight , to become what they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 60 elite runners , compared with several hundred by Kenya , according to running experts . The Ethiopian Olympic Committee receives $35,000 a year from the government , and in an Olympic year , corporate sponsorships can push the budget to $230,000 , Assefa Mamo , president of the Olympic Committee , said . In comparison , the United States Olympic Committee 's annual budget is $125 million . <p> Bureaucratic meddling and corruption have sometimes impeded Ethiopian success , according to Ethiopians and Westerners with knowledge of the track system . But 13 years after a brutal Communist regime was ousted , and four years after a border dispute with neighboring Eritrea ended , Ethiopia 's running program is thriving . <p> Running is a national pastime in a country where the altitude  --  Addis Ababa sits at 7,300 feet  --  helps to increase oxygen-carrying capacity . The Ethiopian diet consists heavily of teff , which is rich in easily assimilated protein and has more iron , calcium and potassium than wheat . <p> While the Kenyan runners , for instance , frequently run in Europe and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To leave the country , runners must obtain exit visas , which are closely controlled by the government 's track federation . <p> A life of deprivation and a willingness to endure suffering also seem to play a role in accepting and completing the exhaustive training for elite distance running , Gebrselassie and other athletes said . As a boy , he said , he ran to and from school and spent up to three hours on sojourns to gather water during the dry season . <p> " I 've been running since I was 4 or 5 , " Gebrselassie said . " For us , life was a kind of sport . " <p> Runners who show promise in regional competitions are signed and paid salaries by clubs representing the prison police , a bank association , an electric company and a cement factory . <p> The first trip to run in Addis Ababa can be unnerving though . Running barefoot , Berhane Aregaui , who is 21 , won a regional 5,000-meters competition at the national stadium on Thursday . For the first time , she competed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I was scared of the audience , but the track was fine , " Aregaui said . <p> Life-Changing Races <p> Success on the track can bring a dramatic change to modest lives . Three years ago , Tirunesh Dibaba was living without electricity in a two-room home in the village of Bekoji . After completing sixth grade , she moved to Addis Ababa to join a sister and Tulu , her cousin . But Dibaba said she showed up late for seventh-grade registration and , unable to continue in school , dedicated herself to running . Last summer in Paris , at 17 , she became the youngest track athlete to win a world championship , finishing first in the 5,000 meters . <p> For her victory , Dibaba won $60,000 in prize money . Now she and her sister , Ejigayehu , another promising runner , own a sport utility vehicle and rent a four-bedroom house , where they care for two younger sisters . Soon , they will move into a new house built from track earnings . Meselech Melkamu , 19 , the women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook and clean in her rented house . <p> " My life has changed a lot , " Melkamu said . " I am not a burden on my family . It is important to manage on my own . I want to be like Haile , to be famous and win many races . " <p> If she does , Melkamu , too , will gain her place of honor at the national stadium . Three sets of Olympic rings sit above the backstretch . Individual rings bear the likenesses of Ethiopia 's Olympic champions . Inside other rings are question marks that ask , who will be the next champion ? The answer could come soon in Athens . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com <p> CORRECTION-DATE : May 29 , 2004 <p> CORRECTION : <p> A sports article on May 11 about Ethiopia 's rise to power in distance-running events referred incorrectly to the record set by Abebe Bikila 's victory in the 1960 Olympic marathon .
