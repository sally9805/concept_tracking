Jaime Morales was a wealthy Nicaraguan banker in the 1980s when Daniel Ortega stole his six-bedroom house . Ortega , who was then Nicaragua 's President , called it a justified " confiscation " on behalf of the Marxist revolution that he and his Sandinista Front were leading . Morales became a leader of the U.S.-backed contra army that waged a civil war with the Sandinistas . That conflict killed 30,000 people and led to Ortega 's ouster in a 1990 election  --  after which he paid Morales for the house . <P> It 's a sign of either Ortega 's maturation or his opportunism  --  or both  --  that when he recaptured Nicaragua 's presidency in the Nov. 5 election , his running mate was none other than Morales . Ortega still wears that drowsy look of arrogant defiance , speaks in the same mumbling cadence and insists on driving his SUV himself to cultivate a populist image . But with Morales beside him in a Managua hotel ballroom , schmoozing local and foreign investors , Ortega sounds like a changed man . " We wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining forces with them , " he says . Ortega is playing to the audience , but even former rivals believe that his evolution from communist strongman to nascent capitalist may be genuine . Says Morales : " Daniel Ortega deserves a chance to vindicate himself . " <P> That , of course , is exactly what some in Washington are afraid of . Ortega 's turn-back-the-clock triumph has rekindled memories of Washington 's cold war obsession with Nicaragua , which embroiled the U.S. in a bloody guerrilla campaign and nearly doomed the Reagan presidency . Although Nicaragua , a nation of 5.5 million , is one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere , the prospect of an Ortega restoration prompted the Bush Administration to threaten to cut off more than $200 million in total aid to the country and moved cold warriors like former U.S. Marine Lieut . Colonel Oliver North to fly to Managua to campaign against him . The U.S. is concerned that Ortega will become another boisterously anti-American voice of Latin America 's new left , which is led by Venezuelan President Hugo Chvez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee on democracy promotion last week , Richard Soudriette , president of the Washington-based International Foundation for Election Systems , volunteered that he had just returned from Nicaragua . " Coming from Oklahoma , " he told her , " where we 're familiar with people who are born again , it appears that the future President , Daniel Ortega , is at least claiming that he has had a change of heart . " Rice answered tersely , " We 'll see . "
