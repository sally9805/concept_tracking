<p> FOR the second consecutive year , mutual fund investors poured a record amount of money into foreign stock funds . And for the second consecutive year , this has led to a good deal of hand-wringing on Wall Street . After all , similar euphoria greeted technology stocks in the late 1990s and the housing market during much of this decade . <p> The giddy mood may be most obvious in emerging-markets stocks . Last year , investors poured nearly $14 billion of net new money into funds with holdings in the still-risky emerging economies of Asia , Eastern Europe and Latin America , according to Citigroup Investment Research . That was about 15 percent more than they invested in domestic stock funds in 2006 . <p> This marks a big change in investor behavior . Tobias M. Levkovich , Citigroup 's chief United States equity strategist , pointed out in a recent research report that over the past 10 years , domestic stock funds have pulled in around 27 times the money that emerging-market funds attracted each year , on average . <p> But the emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year , the bulk of international fund flows  --  in fact , more than $134 billion  --  went into foreign stock funds that invest in the more stable , developed markets of Western Europe and Japan . <p> And when it comes to investing in these markets , " fundamental factors validate the fund flows , " said Alec Young , international equity strategist at Standard &; Poor 's Equity Research . <p> Despite five consecutive years of outperforming the S. &; P. 500 index of domestic blue-chip stocks , foreign shares in general still look as attractive  --  or , in many cases , more so  --  than domestic stocks , many investors say . <p> And here are some of the reasons:CORPORATE PROFIT GROWTH  --  While earnings growth among French and British companies is on part with earnings in the United States , overall corporate profit growth in Europe is expected to exceed that of domestic companies this year , said Mike Thompson , managing director of global research at Thomson Financial . <p> For example , earnings for the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb 8 percent this year , according to Thomson Financial . That 's ahead of the 7 percent growth anticipated for the S. &; P. 500 . <p> In Japan , meanwhile , corporate profits are predicted to jump around 14 percent in 2007 , according to Mr. Young . That 's comparable to the projected earnings growth rate for the emerging markets.LOWER VALUATIONS  --  In general , valuations are still lower outside the United States . Despite the run-up in the price of foreign shares lately , there is " still substantial relative value overseas , " said Simon L. Davis , co-portfolio leader for the Putnam International Equity fund . <p> To be sure , " valuations have narrowed , because obviously the emerging markets have had a strong run , as have the developed non-U.S . markets , " Mr. Davis said . But many international stock markets in continental Europe still trade at far cheaper prices than the domestic market . <p> Based on estimated 2007 earnings , for example , German and French stocks are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 13 , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ index of blue-chip stocks on the London Stock Exchange trades at a mere 12.4 times estimated earnings for 2007 . <p> By comparison , domestic stocks have a P/E of around 15.4 , based on the S. &; P. 500 . THE DECLINING DOLLAR  --  The dollar is still expected to lose value in the coming months . After weakening in 2006 against the euro , " most people do n't see a lot of reason why the dollar would appreciate " this year , Mr. Thompson said . <p> One reason is that the Federal Reserve stopped raising short-term interest rates last year and appears to be in a holding pattern that could leave rates steady for the remainder of 2007 . <p> Central banks around the world , meanwhile , still seem to be tightening their monetary policies . That means money parked in dollars in the United States will earn about as much as it did last year , while investors who hold their money abroad could see a bump up in yields . <p> And should the dollar continue to lose value against global currencies , domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the underlying stock markets in those countries do n't gain much ground . <p> That 's because , whenever the dollar loses value , it serves as a tailwind for Americans investing overseas . Each share of foreign stock that Americans own will become worth that many more dollars when the securities are eventually sold and repatriated back to the United States.A NEED TO DIVERSIFY  --  In recent years , individual investors have been building up their foreign holdings dramatically , but many portfolios are still out of balance . <p> At the end of 2002 , only 2.7 percent of 401(k) money was held in foreign stocks , according to Hewitt Associates . That represented around 4.5 percent of a typical worker 's stake in stocks . <p> Today , 9.2 percent of the average 401(k) is held in foreign stocks , representing about 13 percent of the typical investor 's stock allocation . <p> Given that more than half of the world 's stock market capitalization resides in companies based outside the United States , that 's still a modest amount . So do n't be surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially as they become more and more comfortable with investing their money internationally . <p> But keep in mind that while investors in general may still be underweighted in foreign equities , many individuals already have too much . <p> Mr. Young said investors should probably keep about 15 percent of their total portfolios in developed-market foreign shares , with an additional 5 percent or so in emerging-market stocks . Once you achieve those levels , " you have to rebalance regularly , " he said . <p> In other words , if your foreign stake grows to 25 percent of your total holdings , be prepared to sell into the rally and take some of that money off the table , Mr. Young said . <p> He stressed : " These assets should be thought of as long-term core holdings , not some hot asset class to chase .
