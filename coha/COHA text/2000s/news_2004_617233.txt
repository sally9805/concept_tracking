<p> It almost feels like ancient history now , those inflammatory days of homoerotic photographs and crucifixes suspended in urine . <p> The National Endowment for the Arts is winning new allies as it reshapes an image overshadowed by controversy . <p> Even the White House has seemingly gotten behind the federal agency . President Bush has requested an $18 million increase for the NEA in fiscal year 2005 . If approved , that would be its largest boost in two decades . <p> The NEA 's turnaround has been achieved , in part , through high-profile tours of unassailable works and reaching out to traditionally underserved areas , including Georgia and other Southern states . <p> In the federal pipeline are Main Street programs with broad proletarian appeal and built-in political armor : Shakespeare on military bases . Small-town symphony orchestras . The national parading of jazz giants . <p> The projects are part of a dramatic grass-roots realignment for the NEA engineered by new Chairman Dana Gioia . The poet son of a Los Angeles cabdriver , Gioia ( pronounced JOY-uh ) wants to " democratize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has traditionally seen itself as serving the arts community into an agency which serves the American people . " <p> Those two aims are not mutually exclusive , Gioia explained on a recent swing through Atlanta , but they require different approaches . <p> " If you are going to serve the American people , then you have to reach out rather than simply go where arts organizations already exist in a very advanced institutional form . " <p> In Georgia , that means getting outside Atlanta . The NEA 's reach has been minimal everywhere else in the Peach State , at least in terms of direct grants to institutions . <p> Last year , Gioia called Georgia one of the five most underserved states in the country , along with Florida , Texas , Alabama and Mississippi . Last month , he amended that to one of the " bottom 15 states over a three-year period . " <p> However you slice it , the NEA has little presence in Georgia outside its capital city . NEA records show , for example , that six of Georgia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We serve Atlanta very well , relatively speaking , " Gioia says . " Outside of Atlanta , we do n't get as many applications as we should . Consequently , we give very few direct grants . " <p> Indeed , the NEA did not receive a single grant application from District 10 in North Georgia . District 7 , which includes the northern reaches of suburban Atlanta from Gwinnett to Bartow County , was represented by only one application . <p> By comparison , groups in Atlanta  --  which has the biggest concentration of arts organizations in the state , many with experienced grant writers on staff or on contract  --  submitted 38 applications and received 20 grants . <p> Of the total $2.5 million that Georgia organizations landed , nearly $2.4 million went to groups in District 5 , which consists of Atlanta and a few suburbs . <p> ( Other areas throughout the state still get NEA funds through the Georgia Council for the Arts and the Southern Arts Federation , which redistribute their own chunks of federal money . But direct grants , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial sums . ) <p> Broadening reach <p> One way the NEA is redefining itself is through programs designed to address the small number of grants in outlying areas . <p> Last September , the NEA announced it was giving $10,000 each to 25 small and midsize symphony orchestras nationwide . Three Georgia ensembles made the list : Augusta , Macon and Rome . <p> In Bibb County , the federal money allowed the Macon Symphony to perform its annual Pumpkin Pops concert last fall when a local funder pulled out . <p> " We could n't have offered it otherwise , " says Doris Wood , the orchestra 's general manager . " It helped morale tremendously because we had not had an NEA grant in a while . " <p> The Alabama Shakespeare Festival is feeling the NEA 's clout on a larger scale . <p> The Montgomery-based theater is one of seven national companies chosen to participate in the agency 's " Shakespeare in American Communities " program , which is bringing the bard 's work to underserved areas . <p> The ASF is getting $750,000 to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fall . Cast and crew will travel as far west as Colorado in three buses . <p> The company will barely break even on the tour , but the national exposure is worth it . <p> " It 's great because it provides more employment for actors and staff and more publicity for the theater , " says Artistic Director Kent Thompson . <p> Projects like " Shakespeare " and the upcoming " American Masters " are helping the NEA shed what some call an elitist image by aligning it with mom-and-pop themes . " American Masters " is a three-year program designed to bring established masterworks in various genres  --  a Pulitzer Prize-winning play , a classic dance piece  --  to all 50 states . The project would receive $15 million of President Bush 's $18 million budget request . <p> When talking about these programs , Gioia refers repeatedly to " the new NEA . " However , a populist NEA strategy dates back to former Chairman Bill Ivey . <p> Appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1998 , the erstwhile chief of the Country Music Foundation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that emphasized arts education , youth and communities . <p> Before Ivey , things looked bleak . The NEA served for years as a political punching bag . <p> During the Reagan era , the agency was scorned by some conservative politicians , who talked about eliminating it . In the 1990s , Republican critics of the NEA hot-wired the agency to a handful of controversial grants that funded , in small part , edgy notables such as performance artist Karen Finley and photographers Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano , creator of the infamous " Piss Christ , " a photograph of a crucifix suspended in a beaker of urine . <p> The resulting political furor saw the elimination of most individual grants to artists and put the NEA on the brink of being zeroed out in 1997 . <p> The latter never happened , but it left the agency reeling . <p> Boosting image <p> Gioia viewed the so-called culture wars from a distance , as a respected poet and marketing executive with General Foods . <p> " Watching as an outsider , it seemed to me that the NEA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments that were going on in America , " he says of the tempest . " It was n't really about the arts . " <p> Since its founding in 1965 , he points out , the NEA has given more than 120,000 grants  --  of which about a dozen have been controversial . <p> " Most people know one or two of those controversial grants , " Gioia says . " Unfortunately , they do n't know much about the other 120,000 grants . That 's been our failure . We have not done a good job portraying the value that we give . " <p> Between 1992 and 2000 , the NEA 's budget was cut from a high of nearly $176 million to $97 million . <p> But thanks to its new education-oriented approach , the agency has seen small gains in recent years . The current appropriation is $121 million . <p> " I think Ivey and especially Gioia have done a lot to battle the NEA 's negative image , " says Tim Hedgepeth , executive director of the Mississippi Arts Commission . <p> The arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's certainly not the hot topic it was . " <p> Despite recent budget upticks , however , nobody was prepared for the stunning news of Jan. 29 , when first lady Laura Bush announced that the White House was requesting an $18 million increase for the NEA in the coming year . <p> While many artists and arts administrators hailed the NEA endorsement , it has also raised suspicions about President Bush 's intentions . After all , it 's an election year , and the increase  --  which will fall short of bringing the NEA 's budget back to its early- ' 90s apogee  --  still has to be approved by a Republican Congress . <p> " He 's been able to make a grand gesture with a number that is so tiny as to be absurd in relation to the big picture , " Susan Medak , managing director of the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in Northern California , told the San Francisco Chronicle . <p> A critic at New York 's Newsday expressed reservations shared by other arts leaders : " Sorry , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the NEA will put artists right back in the crosshairs . " <p> Should the creative community be concerned ? Is the Bush request just a case of election-year politicking ? <p> " I think the president and first lady 's support is quite genuine , " responds Gioia . <p> " Before I took this job , I had the assurance from the White House that they wanted to rebuild the NEA as an institution in which Americans could take pride .
