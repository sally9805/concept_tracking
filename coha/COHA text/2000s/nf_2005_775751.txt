The Anatolian Smile // He wanted to be something  --  somebody  --  long before he knew what , exactly , he wanted to be . In that sense , Elia Kazan 's story is a typical immigrant 's story . There is something fierce and needy about this young man that chimes with the tales of thousands upon thousands of American newcomers in the first decades of the twentieth century . For these young strangers , living , often precariously , in families where English was forever the second language , the simple desire to make something of themselves  --  they did n't much care what , as long as it entailed rising out of a class treated contemptuously by America 's ruling WASPs  --  was their ruling passion . // But making something of yourself implies a remaking of that self  --  either by aping the manner , dress , speech , attitudes of the elite or by becoming a determined rebel , if not a full-scale revolutionary . The annals of the radical left ( and , more recently , the radical right ) are rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ) who became cultural and political subversives ( as Kazan did , in his early years ) . // He could not , however , long maintain the dedicated political or cultural radical 's vow of poverty . The pull of his family 's values and ambitions was too strong . They had come to America for the simplest reasons  --  to escape tyranny in their native land ( they were Anatolian Greeks , ruled for centuries by Turks )  --  and to make good , which they defined simply as making as much money as possible as quickly as possible . Kazan might insist that he remained a lifelong " man of the left . " But he also remained his father 's son and his uncle 's nephew , inheriting their Depression-dashed dreams of riches . // So there was always in Elia Kazan a conflict between his ideals and his ambitions . It was a conflict he tried to ameliorate  --  though he never succeeded in fully settling it  --  by burying a profound anger under an air of eager accommodation , of ostensible good nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plays and movies , imparting to them a passion , a psychological intensity ; particularly in the performances of his actors , that was largely without precedent in the theatrical arts , and hugely influential on their later history . // Kazan 's autobiography , A Life , published in 1988 , when he was seventy-nine years old , begins with a reflection on his seemingly perpetual outrage , and his lifelong need to cover it with his " Anatolian smile , " an expression , much remarked upon by Greeks of his and previous generations , betokening a sort of noncommittal agreeability ; at once distant and obliging  --  but masking one 's deepest feelings . Looking back Kazan wrote simply , " I used to spend most of my time straining to be a nice guy so people would like me. " // The Anatolian smile may be a sort of racial tic , but after his arrival in the United States ( at age four ) , it became a major tool of survival . His father , George  --  full name Kazanjioglou  --  was an old-world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both great and small . One of George 's brothers , whose story his nephew would eventually tell with candor , sympathy and irony in America , America , as well as in two novels , had preceded them and set up a carpet business , in which George joined him . By the l9zos , that business was prospering  --  though " Uncle Joe " had left it  --  and George and his family had moved to a fine suburban house . His father expected Elia and his brother to join him in the business-no questions asked or , for that matter , permitted . // But Kazan 's mother , Athena , strong-minded and stubborn , had other ideas for him . She entered into a " conspiracy " ( Kazan 's word ) with one of his high school teachers in New Rochelle to see if her bright lad could gain admission to a good college . They settled on Williams College , for no other reason , so far as Kazan could remember , except that its WASPy name appealed to them . He enthusiastically joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn money for his tuition . When his father was informed of Elia 's college acceptance , he struck his wife so hard that she was knocked to the floor . Shortly thereafter , they began sleeping in separate bedrooms . // The old man was  --  and remained  --  a frightening figure to Kazan . Many years later , Kazan 's son Nicholas would recall that the only man he had ever seen his father fear was George Kazan , which Kazan himself admitted in his book . By the time Nick could observe the two men together his grandfather was a shrunken , silent figure , but still capable of making his famous son tremble . // It is worth observing that such characters , confident and bullying ( until , generally , they got their comeuppance ) , became staples in all Kazan 's work . They are , symbolically , fascist tyrants ruling the little nations  --  fractious , rebellious , struggling for democratic emergence-that is the family in so many of his dramas . // That someday he would make such use of his own family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents deposited him , wearing a boxy , itchy blue serge suit , on the idyllic Williams campus in the fall of 1926 . It did not occur to him at any time in the four subsequent years , which were anything but idyllic to Kazan . He was obliged to supplement his savings by waiting tables at fraternity houses where , amid the well-born and well-favored , he was patronized when he was noticed at all . He yearned for the frat boys ' dates , the lithe , blond girls he served meals , but he was only comfortable with small , dark , intense young women . He also wanted to be smooth and articulate like their handsome swains. // But often he would go days without speaking  --  a swarthy , runty , big-nosed outsider , nursing a new set of resentments . " It . . . made me rebellious . It also made me join the Communist Party at a certain time because I got resentful of being excluded . I was an outsider . . . but I also was sympathetic with people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up . " //
