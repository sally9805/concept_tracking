<p> THE HOLIDAY 'S TRIUMPHANT RISE FROM AN OVERLOOKED AFTERTHOUGHT IS ONE OF AMERICA 'S GREATEST SUCCESS STORIES . <p> It was the last day of Chanukah , and the family gathering was filled with holiday spirit . Girts were exchanged , the menorah was lit amid prayers and sacred songs , and then everyone sat down for a festive meal . At one point during the evening , an older member of the family found himself alone in the living room with a young cousin . The little girl stared at the naked mantelpiece for a few moments and then suddenly asked , " Why ca n't Santa Claus come to Jewish kids ' houses too ? " Her disconcerted relative could only stammer , " Well , we 're still the chosen people . " And the girl looked him in the eye , defiant and unsatisfied , as only a six-year-old can . <p> Every Jewish family has a story like this . The religious educator Ron Wolfson , in his book The Art of Jewish Living : Hanukkah ( 1990 ) , remembers one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he asked his mother , " Mommy , can we take down the Hanukkah things  --  just for tonight  --  so Santa Claus wo n't know we 're Jewish ? " His mother must have wished her son had n't learned his Passover lessons quite so well . <p> The universal childhood desire for more and better presents explains why in America Chanukah has come to be thought of as the Jewish Christmas  --  or as the Jewish equivalent of Christmas , since a traditional Jewish Christmas , as any urban Jew can tell you , consists of Chinese food and a movie . ( For suburbanites , Jewish Christmas consists of skiing . ) Indeed , well-meaning gentiles often accord Chanukah more importance than casual or nonobservant Jews , who , when wished a Happy Chanukah , are sometimes embarrassed to respond , " Oh , has it started already ? " But despite all the fuss , Chanukah is not really Jewish Christmas . It 's Jewish Kwanzaa . <p> To be sure , Chanukah does have a religious basis  --  unlike Kwanzaa , a weeklong nonsectarian holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chanukah celebrates the rededication in 165 B.C. of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem after a successful revolt against the Syrian tyrant Antiochus . Antiochus had desecrated the temple and required the worship of Greek gods until a hardy band of Jews , led by the indomitable Judah Maccabee , evicted the Syrians with a successful guerrilla campaign . According to legend , when the Jews recovered their temple , they had only enough consecrated lamp oil for a single day , but somehow it burned for eight days until more oil could be prepared . This miracle is commemorated in the eight branches of the Chanukah menorah , or chanukiyah ( not counting the elevated shamos , which is used to light the others ) . <p> The real situation was not quite as tidy as the foregoing brief summary makes it appear . The Jews were not completely united , for example ; a collaborationist faction happily went along with the Syrians ' demands . And after the Maccabees took power , they and their successors adopted numerous aspects of Syria 's culture ( though not its religion ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most important , perhaps , the tradition about one day 's worth of oil lasting eight days is not mentioned in any contemporary record . It first appeared several centuries later in the Talmud , a collection of commentaries and discussions of Jewish law and customs . That was also when the name Chanukah , meaning " re-dedication , " was adopted ; before then , the holiday was known as the Festival of Lights . <p> Because of its postbiblical origins , some theologians classify Chanukah as a mere festival or " semiholiday . " Many other Jewish holy days are more important from a religious standpoint  --  not just Passover , Rosh Hashanah ( the New Year ) , and Yom Kippur ( the Day of Atonement ) but also Simchat Torah , Shavuot , and Sukkot . Still , surveys show that among American Jews , Chanukah candle lighting vies with the Passover Seder as the most widely practiced religious ritual . <p> The reason , of course , is christmas , which has posed a December dilemma to American Jews for more than a century and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family of Mordecai Noah  --  a prosperous New York City journalist and lawyer who kept kosher  --  put up stockings to celebrate Christmas as the birthday of the religion that had spread monotheism around the world . In 1856 The New York Times reported that " in most European countries , however repugnant it may be to their sentiments , we find the Jews giving presents on Christmas , " while in New York , " they are released from this awkward predicament , for they can give their children presents at New-Year 's , " in keeping with a venerable local custom . In neither of these cases was substituting Chanukah considered an option ; it was simply too insignificant . <p> After the Civil War , some Jewish newspapers reported a modest revival of interest in Chanukah . In general , though , as Jenna Weissman Joselit points out in The Wonders of America ( 1994 ) , it remained a minor celebration for hard-core religious Jews and nothing at all for the rest . " The customary candles disappear more and more from Jewish homes , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish newspaper had pleaded with its readers to " try the effect of the Hanukkah lights . If just for the experiment , try it . " <p> During the twentieth century , and especially after World War II , the situation changed . This change took place for four reasons , which in approximate chronological order were Zionism , assimilation , the Holocaust , and Israel . Zionism , the belief in the need for a Jewish homeland , began to gather force toward the end of the nineteenth century . From the start , its leaders appreciated the propaganda value of a holiday that emphasized Jewish self-determination . <p> Zionism met considerable hostility within America 's faction-ridden Jewish community . Part of it came from the strictly Orthodox , who held to the biblical prophecy that the Jews would never have a permanent home before the arrival of the Messiah . But more Jews took exception to the basic idea that they could not find a place within gentile society . Those who hoped to do just that felt obliged to oppose Zionism . Such Jews , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tended to downplay or ignore Chanukah because of its nationalistic , anti-assimilation overtones . <p> Despite this controversy , zionism gave its followers a reason to emphasize Chanukah . A different reason , working on a different group of Jews , came into play in the decades before World War II , a time when pressure on all immigrants to become " American " was at its peak . Most Jews today know at least one family in which the grandparents have names like Chaim and Zipporah ; their children are called Robert and Diane ; and their grandchildren are all Joshuas and Naomis . In similar fashion , not long ago it was common for a Jewish grandmother and her granddaughters to have pierced ears , while the women of the generation in between did not  --  because ear piercing smacked of the old country . <p> Since " Americanization " was so prized , and since Christmas was such a big deal in America , many Jews put up trees , exchanged Christmas gifts , and adopted other trappings of the season . Jewish leaders worried that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assimilation . The little-used holiday of Chanukah offered an easy way to re-emphasize Judaism , especially for children , who were most susceptible to the lure of the false god Santa Claus . For this reason , in the 1920s and 1930s many Reform Jews restored Chanukah to their calendar of holidays and even began emphasizing it . <p> So now another group of Jews had a reason to celebrate Chanukah : those who bought into the melting-pot idea but still wished to retain their ethnic identity . Nonetheless , there remained a large sector who neither advocated Zionism nor felt a need to reinforce their Jewishness by puffing up a minor holiday . To Jews who lived in heavily Jewish neighborhoods and stuck to their traditional religion , assimilation was not yet much of a threat . In Harvey and Myrna Katz Frommer 's Growing Up Jewish in America ( 1995 ) , the writer Murray Polner , who was raised in Brooklyn in the 1930s , recalled : " There was very little hoopla over Chanukah . Once my Uncle Willie gave me fifty cents , and my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retired school administrator , agreed . " Chanukah was a very modest holiday when I was a kid . " Elsewhere , an Orthodox Jew remembered : " Chanukah  --  big deal ! My father gave us each a dollar , won it all back playing dreidel , and then gave us each a quarter . " <p> World War II and its aftermath provided the final impetus for the Christmasization of Chanukah . First of all , there was the Holocaust , which made the holiday 's message of Jewish self-defense resonate much more urgently . Soon afterward came the founding of Israel and its successful war for independence waged by a Maccabee-like army . Together these changes had the effect of concentrating the world 's Jewish population in two places : ever-homogenizing America and ever-endangered Israel . This tied together the Jewish community 's three biggest concerns . Before the war , religion , culture , and Zionism had been three separate , often conflicting topics . Afterward , for most American Jews , it became natural to think of them as one . <p> Chanukah was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews , even partially , may be the greatest Chanukah miracle of all . The revived holiday could accomplish this because in its new , improved form , it had something for everyone . As the years since World War II have shown , there are as many ways to celebrate Chanukah as there are to spell it . Religious Jews , for example , emphasized the sacred aspect , sometimes distributing chanukiyahs and phonetic Hebrew prayers to the nonobservant in hopes of bringing them into the fold . The less devout also flocked to the new-old holiday , but with a subtle distinction : While the Orthodox used it to celebrate the consecration of the temple after the Maccabees ' victory , secular Jews tended to focus on celebrating the victory itself . <p> Besides the political message it carries , this shift in emphasis , from the renewed sanctification of Judaism 's holiest place to an upset victory by a plucky underdog , has allowed the holiday to be celebrated by those whose tolerance for miracles extends no further than the movie Hoosiers . Even the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians suggest that the miracle of the loaves and fishes was really a giant potluck supper . Best of all for less-than-fervent Jews , Chanukah involves no fasting , you do n't have to skip work , and no synagogue attendance is required . <p> In an age when faith is on the decline , Chanukah can be a sort of Judaism Lite , allowing religion and culture to be combined in whatever proportions best suit the celebrant . Not everyone is happy with the results . Frank Rich , the long-time theater critic , gives his postwar upbringing a characteristically unenthusiastic review : " The emphasis on Chanukah in relation to other more important Jewish holidays was one of the things that made organized Reform Judaism seem bogus to me . " But for those not destined to become critics , the holiday 's protean nature was useful , especially as Jews moved out of the familiar environment of their urban enclaves . In 1958 Rich 's future employer , The New York Times , reported that " the years since the war have seen a resurgence of Hanukkah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews had suddenly " realized their minority status . " Earlier generations of Jews had spent their lives surrounded , if not overwhelmed , by Jewish culture . Now the biggest influences on their children 's lives were Elvis and Mickey Mouse . <p> Nor was the borrowing all one-way . With Middle Americans guffawing at Borscht Belt comedians on television , noshing on Jewish deli food , and sprinkling their conversation with Yiddishisms , Jews now had to make an effort to stand out from their fellow Americans , rather than ( as before ) to blend in . Cultural syncretism eventually reached the point where bagels could be purchased at McDonald 's ( with ham or pork sausage yet ) . For those who were falling away from their heritage , Israel served as a real-world museum where Jews could preserve their culture and beliefs without actually having to live them . And Jewish religious rituals  --  which , unlike Jewish food or humor , were not likely to be co-opted by gentiles  --  provided a way to keep Jewishness from disintegrating into the universal solvent of American mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture is what Chanukah is all about . Hershl Hartman , a " secular humanist " Jewish scholar , sees in the religious aspects of the holiday a conspiracy of ancient rabbis to hijack a pre-existing winter folk festival that was also a celebration of popular revolution . In place of the traditional prayers , he recommends reading meaningful passages after each candle is lit , a process that may leave participants feeling that a quick trip to the synagogue would be preferable . <p> To fund-raisers and boosters of Jewish causes , Chanukah plays the role that The Nutcracker does for ballet companies : a holiday tradition that may be a bit overdone , but for a good cause . Leftist Jews tailor their celebrations to express sympathy with the struggle for liberation of oppressed peoples . For religiously mixed families , a chanukiyah on the Christmas table and a Star of David atop the tree keep everybody happy . Even non-Jews can get in on the act by putting chanukiyahs in their village squares or building lobbies . <p> As for children , Chanukah gives them at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudolph , and " Jingle Bells . " The Old World custom of giving small cash gifts on Chanukah has expanded to include cars , vacations , and the latest electronic gadgets . In some ways , Chanukah out-Christmases Christmas , because you can get presents on all eight days and there 's even legal gambling with the dreidel . Imaginative families put up " Chanukah bushes , " hang blue-and-white stockings decorated with six-pointed stars to be filled by " Chanukah Harry " or " Uncle Max , " read stories about " Smiley Shalom " ( a Jewish Frosty the Snowman ) , and cover their houses in bushels of electric lights . America 's Jews have reacted to their exclusion from Christmas the way they typically react to their exclusion from a country club : by building a better one of their own . <p> So that 's why Chanukah is best thought of as Jewish Kwanzaa  --  an invented cultural celebration that each family or group adapts in its own way . Of course , by the same token , Christmas is Christian Kwanzaa ( and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many people are in your office on December 28 ) . Easter commemorates the central miracle of the Christian faith ; Christmas was not observed until early in the fourth century , when the purported anniversary of Jesus ' birth was fixed on the date of a pre-existing Roman festival , the same way Kwanzaa was opportunistically placed in the week between Christmas and New Year 's . Not until the mid-nineteenth century did Christmas become an industrializing America 's dominant winter holiday . Just like Chanukah , it grew to fill a need . <p> Today , in a country where the martyred war dead are memorialized with barbecues and Martin Luther King 's birthday is remembered with Caribbean vacations , Chanukah truly deserves to be called the greatest American holiday . It is democratic , inclusive , and multicultural , and it celebrates liberation ; it rose from modest beginnings ; it is at once commercial , religious , and political ; it merges immigrant and homegrown influences ; it is a recent innovation that goes back thousands of years ; it is frivolous yet meaningful and synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult agenda ; it requires spending lots of money ; and with the endless disputes it engenders over chanukiyahs in schools and public places , Chanukah ties in with the most quintessentially American custom of all : lawsuits . The Cinderella holiday promises to endure as long as Jewish six-year-olds are assaulted by a two-month marketing blitz every year , and as long as Israel is surrounded by enemies sworn to destroy it . In other words , there is little doubt that American Jews will continue to celebrate Chanukah with the greatest degree of enthusiasm forever . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The two holidays coexist at a distance in Frederic Brenner 's panoramic portrait of the religiously mixed Colan family of Staten Island , New York . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Christina Patoski recorded this brilliantly lit yard in Fremont , California , for her book Merry Christmas America . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A display in Hollywood , Florida , suggests why Chanukah is called the Festival of Lights . <p> By Frederic D.
