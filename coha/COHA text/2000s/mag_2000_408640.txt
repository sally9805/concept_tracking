It 's not too early to lay the groundwork for the lessons that matter most Photograph // Every family operates according to its own personal values . But when it comes to the specific principles that guide our financial behavior , there are some that nearly all parents A wish to pass on to their children . Most of us , for instance , want our kids to understand that money does n't buy happiness or love and that self-worth is n't measured in dollars and cents . We want them to realize that they ca n't always have everything they want in life , exactly when they want it . And we 'd like to think they 'll grow up to be the kind of people who reach out , at least in some small way , to help others less fortunate than themselves . Yet important as we believe these values are , few of us think about formally teaching them to our childrenat least , not while they 're still babies , toddlers , or preschoolers . Yet experts say that 's exactly the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young children ca n't easily learn specific financial skills , such as saving , budgeting , and borrowing , they can and do absorb the attitudes that will influence the way they manage their finances for the rest of their lives . " Kids five and under are like a bowl of freshly made Jell-O when it comes to teaching them financial values , " says Mary Hunt , author of Debt Proof Your Kids . " You 've still got time to put lots of stuff in before they set . " One thing 's for sure : Children these days are bombarded by messages about money very different from the ones most of us would like them to hear . By some estimates , U.S. marketers now spend more than $1.3 billion annually on advertising directed at kids-over 20 times the amount spent just a decade ago-and a rising proportion of those dollars are being focused on the 0-to-3-year-old set . The goal : to foster brand loyalty even before a child can talk in complete sentences . Apparently , the strategy is working . More than one out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 and 3 to nag them for brand-name products , and almost half say their children do so by age 5 , according to a new study by the Center for a New American Dream , a nonprofit organization , in Takoma Park , Maryland , that promotes responsible consumerism . Even more sobering : Nearly two-thirds of the surveyed parents reported that their children define their self-worth in terms of material possessions ; the parents believe it is worse than in their own generation . To make sure your child is grounded in the financial values you hold dear : Talk about your money values NO ONE 'S SUGGESTING YOU TRY TO sit your child down for a lecture on the evils of an overly materialistic society . But in the course of your daily routines , you can make your views known by helping your child interpret the financial world she sees around her .

If your child 's best friend has lots more toys and lives in a fancier house than yours , you might remark sometime that , while it might seem like fun to live in such a place , you 'd have to work many more hours to earn the money it would cost , and you 'd rather spend that time with her . Conversely , if she has good friends who have far fewer material possessions , you can point out that there are always people in the world who have more stuff than you do and others who have less , but that does n't really affect how much we like them . And if you 're telling true tales from your own life , be sure to confess to a few mistakes-say , a time you had squandered money foolishly or were taken in by a misleading advertisement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect , making these anecdotes especially powerful . Do things together besides shopping STUDIES SHOW THAT YOUNG CHILdren typically go shopping two to three times a week . Meanwhile , almost half of all parents surveyed by the Center for a New American Dream admit their children would rather go to the mall than for a hike in the woods as a family . " If we go shopping with our kids all the time , eventually they 're going to get the notion that buying things is good and fun , " says Marc Eisenson , author of Invest in Yourself . Six Secrets to a Rich Life . " If we do n't want them to think that way , we have to stop using the mall as recreation . " To the extent that it 's possible , schedule shopping trips for times when you wo n't be forced to take your little one along . Be sure to enjoy some noncommercial activities together , so your child does n't equate leisure time with spending money . Rely on hugs , praise , and gifts of your time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special outing ) rather than a new toy or treat to motivate or reward your child . Says psychologist Mary Pipher , Ph.D. , author of The Shelter of Each Other . Rebuilding Our Families , " When stuff is the standard reward , children learn to value stuff . " Tune out commercial messages THE MOST OBVIOUS WAY TO DO IT : Photograph When the wish list is longer than your child , it 's time to nip cupidity in the bud // Limit your youngster 's television viewing and the catchy commercials that come with it . Between the ages of 2 and 5 , today 's average child watches about 25 hours of TV a week and views an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 commercials a year . " At that age , children have a limited ability to distinguish fact from fiction-they see the commercial and that is their reality , " says Betsy Taylor , executive director of Center for a New American Dream and a mother of two . " If the ad tells them they have to have a certain toy , wear certain clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well liked , they tend to believe it . " So when your child does see an advertisement , do n't let it come through unfiltered . Know what he 's watching , and then help him interpret , in an ageappropriate manner , what he 's seeing on the screen . With a 2-year-old , for instance , you might utter a pejorative phrase when a commercial comes on that lets the child know you do n't believe such nonsensesomething simple like , " That 's just silly ! " With a 3- or a 4-yearold , you might pose questions that help him see through the commercial , like " Do you really think you 'll play basketball better if you eat that cereal or drink that soda ? " or " Have you ever seen a toy move like that in real life ? " " Helping kids process commercials is crucial to teaching them to deal with today 's consumer culture , " says Pipher .

" Five-year-olds who get a new Barbie or action figure every time they beg for one eventually turn into sixteen-year-olds who think they have a constitutional right to a car , " says Barbara Weltman , author of The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Raising Money-Smart Kids . " They 're also more likely to be the kind of adults who run up huge credit card balances and can never seem to save for the long-term . They 've never learned the discipline to forgo something now to get something later . " So just as you routinely have your child wait until after dinner to eat dessert , practice postponing the purchase of a toy or treat until a more financially appropriate time . Put the item in question on a wish list for a birthday and holiday or , better yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it herself . Even kids who are n't old enough for an allowance-the typical age to begin is 5 or 6-are likely to receive some money periodically , courtesy of birthday gifts or adoring grandparents . Encourage your child to put some of that money in a piggy bank , with an eye toward buying a toy that she really craves . Make sure the goal is achievable within a short period-say , no more than two or three weeks-and if it 's not , be prepared to supplement her stash with a little cash of your own , suggests Weltman . After all , the idea is not to frustrate your child , but rather to empower her with the knowledge that many things she wants are within her grasp , if she 's willing to wait and work hard to get them . Nurture charitable impulses " MOST KIDS NATURALLY WANT TO be helpful to others , " says Deborah Spaide , president of Kids Care Clubs , a nationwide nonprofit organization that promotes charity in children . " All parents have to do is point them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest kids by including them in your own charitable activities , whenever and however appropriate . If you 're planning to donate toys and clothes to a homeless shelter this holiday season , for instance , let your 3-year-old help pick out the items , and then take him along when you bring in your contribution . " The younger children are when they become involved in charitable acts , " says Spaide , " the more likely it is that helping others will become a natural part of their lives . " As your child gets older , help him follow his own charitable interests . If your 5-year-old seems particularly moved by the plight of homeless people , for example , brainstorm with him about ways he can help . Perhaps he could collect clothes and toiletries from members of his soccer team and take them to a local shelter . Notes Spaide , " The important thing is for the child to feel ownership of the act , rather than simply doing as he 's told . " Look in the mirror " VALUES ARE MORE OFTEN CAUGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as with many other things , what you do with your money counts far more in imparting sound financial values than what you say . So take a good look at the way you spend , manage , and talk about money to get a handle on the messages you 're sending your child . Do you go to the mall to buy one pair of shoes , and often come back with three pairs , two dresses , and a purse ? Do you regularly make envious comments about the material possessions of people you know-their cars , their clothes , and their big-screen TVs ? Your kids are watching . So the most important way you can promote good financial values in your child may simply be to force yourself to be more aware of how you handle money yourself . One suggestion , says Gwen Reichbach , Ph.D. , director of the National Institute for Consumer Education , in Ypsilanti , Michigan " Whatever you 're doing , remember to ask yourself , " How is my child likely to interpret my actions ? What is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like the answers , you know what you need to do . " In the end , the only way to get your kids to understand the financial values you hold is to live the life you believe in , " says Eisenson . " There are no shortcuts . " Sidebar Saving for a Special Goal Joshua DeMichele 's obsession started on his second birthday . With a single present-a Thomas the Tank Engine train from his Uncle Adam-Joshua was hooked . He badgered his mom to borrow every Thomas video from their local library . He pressed her for frequent visits to a nearby toy store to check out the Thomas trains and engines on display . And he pleaded with her to buy every one . While his mother was n't prepared to do that-at $10 to $17 each , the trains were too expensive-she gave Joshua a piggy bank when was 3 so that he could save his money and buy them himself . Joshua was thrilled . Birthday and holiday money from his grandparents went straight into the piggy bank . So did the quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he 'd finally saved enough to buy a train , Joshua proudly carried his piggy bank to the toy store , picked out the one he wanted , spilled his money out on the floor , and counted it out carefully for the cashier . " When she handed Joshua that train , the look on his face was pure joy , " says his mom , Sharon . For Sharon DeMichele , a former middle-school teacher , and her husband , Alan , a senior training assistant at an insurance company , the " Thomas " savings plan is just one of the everyday opportunities they 've found to pass along their financial values to Joshua , now 4 , and his sisters , Caity , 2 , and Alison , 8 months . Joshua and his mom go through the supermarket flyer together every week and plan menus based on what 's on sale . The whole family talks back to the TV when commercials get too outlandish . And they plan birthday parties that emphasize fun over cost . Says DeMichele , " We want our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of money to have a great time . " Sidebar Kids Helping Kids Anne Holland-McCowan did n't deliberately set out to teach her son , John , to be charitable . But when it presented itself , she seized the opportunity to explain to him that not every child in the world was as fortunate as he was . While the family was on a beach vacation , John , then 4 , began to talk about how he did n't need toys on the trip because he preferred to play with the sand , shells , and starfish . His mom then told him that some children never had any toys to play with because their families could n't afford to buy them . She was completely unprepared for her son 's reaction , John started to cry , and insisted that he and his mom had to do something to fix the situation . His mom figured the distress would pass , but John remained upset for the rest of the trip and long after the family had returned home , to Los Gatos , CA . Holland-McCowan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil , also a lawyer , realized they had to ease their son 's distress . So John 's mom sat down with him to discuss ways he could help children who did n't have any toys . First , John thought he 'd gather up all his old toys and give them away . But he dismissed that idea , because he said that kids deserve new toys . Then , he thought he could buy them new toys if he saved up all of his allowance . So he began putting every penny of his quarter-a-week allowance , along with birthday and holiday money , into a piggy bank that they labeled Kids Helping Kids . " We could n't believe how tenacious he was , " says Holland-McCowan . It took a few months , but John finally saved enough money to buy a Lego set . His mom suggested dropping off the gift at a local children 's shelter . But John said he wanted to play with the child who received his gift . That was three years ago , and John , now 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends to do the same . His efforts , with his mom 's help , have evolved into a nonprofit organization called Kids Cheering Kids , which boasts 350 young members who devote time , toys , and art supplies to homes for the homeless and disabled . " All along , we 've simply followed John 's enthusiasm , " says his mom , who now spends roughly 30 hours a week coordinating the organization 's efforts . " Children can understand more than we give them credit for and do much to help others if only we let them .

Raising Patrick and Katie without commercial influence is n't always easy , their parents acknowledge . But Terrill Browne , a former substitute teacher who 's now a full-time mom , and her husband , William , a weapons systems officer stationed at Vance Air Force Base , in Enid , OK , are determined to minimize the impact of consumer culture on their kids for as long as they can . " We do n't want them thinking they need a lot of material possessions to be happy , or to be influenced by a lot of ads trying to convince them they need stuff that they really do n't , " says their mom . Toward that end , the Brownes keep TV viewing to a minimum : The children watch just a half hour a day of mostly noncommercial programs or videos .
