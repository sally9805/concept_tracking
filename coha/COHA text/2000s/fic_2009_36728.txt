I have a small house , just my size . The problem is that what happens in one room echoes in the next . The television in the living room I hear in the library , even with the door closed . The radio in the kitchen speaks into the hallway and downstairs bedroom . <br> All sounds waft to the loft upstairs : the rockets ' red glare , the bombs bursting in air . <br> I heard such sound effects forty years ago . The sound of explosives , the bombast of speech . This morning 's mail brought me back to that other place in the most thrilling and terrible time of my youth . <br> I 'm too old to be ducking the news . But the headlines continue to follow me . <br> NOW , 2000+ : The Mysterious Package <br> The **31;469;TOOLONG envelope has been tossed negligently on the porch , where it freezes . It is a chilly day in early spring , March 10 , whose date will echo in this history . When I pull the envelope loose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pried from my own life . <br> The face of the white envelope is gaudy with instructions : stickers in the green family , blue-green and forest green , and an imperious red sticker , all having to do with postal matters : completing the return address on the back , acknowledgment of certified mail , return receipt requested . <br> I am free enough and old enough to choose when to encounter weather . On this unpleasant day I stay indoors . No bell is rung . No postal worker requests a signature or acknowledgment . I become agitated . It is an old reaction to unsolicited mail , whose contents can range from mildly intrusive to threatening . <br> Studying the envelope , I note , among other data , that the cost of postage to sender is $3.21 . Curiously , the name of sender is omitted , yet an address is printed . I phone information ( at the cost of two dollars per inquiry ) , which gives me the phone number to the address . I am mechanically informed that the phone line to 2800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared center , has been discontinued . <br> Then I open the envelope . Since I am warned not to reveal these contents , I determine to reveal all . I have only one question to ask . Sender . Tell me . If you please . Who was the spy who did your bloody work for you ? <br> Then , the Sixties and Grading <br> I was assigned endless classes of Comp 101 : Writing the Term Paper . To prevent madness in the lower ranks , the department allowed the instructors one class of choice in literature or creative writing . In an inner-city university my students did not come close to literature , but each had a hardscrabble tale to tell . So I , a classicist in Greek , taught creative writing . <br> In those days I was n't Helen of Troy , but I was of the same heritage , with a head full of curly black hair . I saw the films starring the regal Irene Papas , with her fall of raven locks , and of Melina Mercouri , a mischievous blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glasses , prescribed after a semester of correcting the phonetic spelling of my students . <br> Hence the marginalia decorating their compositions , with " sp " ; with " dis , " not for " disrespect " but " discontinuity " ; and " awk " for " awkward , " that onomatopoeic abbreviation that crowed around their writings . <br> I was judgmental then , grading everyone and everything that came my way . In the university 's gym , where I exercised before my morning class , I graded the person in front of me , unable to touch her toes or stretch her body to its full length ( C minus ) . I graded people on the street for language and posture ( also C minus ) . All " fucks " received an automatic failing . <br> I graded the cityscape , the slums that surrounded the campus ( F as in " foul " ) . And I graded my office mates in the Bullpen of the English department , where I was the heifer . <br> I marked the priestly Kevin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( B for loyalty but C for boring ) , the slight O'Dwyer ( B for grace ) , and the skeletal , straight-haired Farmer , whose grade , as his persona , kept changing . Ron was our short , dark tribal leader for the time he was with us . He received an A for his rich baritone , elegance of dress , and patrician manner . He was the first of us commoners to be elevated out of the Pen . <br> Ron had his doctorate , Bernstein was taking his orals , and the rest of us were mere ABDs , stratification always present in the Bullpen . <br> Bernstein was the Bullpen put-down , his shrieking laugh bouncing off the walls of our cubicles . <br> " The Music department is having a fete , " he said one day , exaggerating the French fOte , " to be conducted by Dr. ABD , ably assisted by Master TIP . Who would go hear people in rehearsal to be themselves ? " Bernstein was nasty because he was closer to the finish line than we . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and TIP ( Thesis in Preparation ) , we nervously laughed . Not Farmer . <br> " Just tell me what 's so funny , " said Farmer , touchy about matters academic . <br> Inside the Bullpen , the atmosphere was heated , where desks yearned toward one another . <br> We were located next to the executive offices of the chairman , whose heavy tread we heard in the corridor . We Bullpenners were too lowly for his personal visits but received curt notes with his initials in our mailboxes , lying faceup . Anyone distributing notices to the department , pulling out noisy metal box after box , could have read of his displeasure . <br> We were aware that , on whatever door he knocked , he brought ill tidings : one experienced assistant professor , a gifted teacher with limited publication , would not be promoted ; a well-published young woman was discernibly pregnant and that would interfere with her tenure . <br> The chairman was also the guardian of our proper behavior in those unsettling times . An instructor , whose hobby was building harpsichords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear an antiwar expert on Vietnam . <br> " This is an English department , not a war department ! " we heard the chairman shout . <br> Mr. Bernstein called him the Kraut . <br> " That was a different war , " I said . <br> " Same accent , same tread , " said Mr. Bernstein , who holds a grudge forever . Germany was only the tail end of it . Bernstein was angry from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries . <br> " I will never set foot on the soil of Castile , Aragon and Navarre , Sicily , or Portugal , " he vowed , " nor where the arms of the Inquisition traveled to the New World , to Peru , Chile , Argentina , or Brazil . " <br> Because everywhere you looked , explained Bernstein , countries drove the Jews into the sea , he traveled nowhere , except from New York to the Midwest and back east again . If it somehow worked out , his last voyage would be to the Middle East to settle in Zion . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <br> A lucky Greek ? I had luck in my breasts , too much luck in my hips , no luck in my waist . <br> My mother said my face made up for it : earth-brown eyes , serious brows , and " lips from a statue . " <br> " If they resist you , " my mother said , " they 'll be sorry . " <br> There was only one person I found irresistible , and he was not sorry , but resisted me . <br> Should I have informed Bernstein that there was no luck , only volatility , in Greek politics between the democrats and the colonels ? But that would have lessened his own myths . <br> Bernstein , Jack , was always a last name to me , like Farmer and O'Dwyer . Only Kevin , our temporary priest , was called Kevin . He was addressed as " Father " too long , he explained , and longed for informality . <br> Now , 2000+ <br> The files in my envelope have various heads : " Confidential Report-Special Investigation Unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Criminal Investigation Division . " " Criminal Intelligence Bureau . " <br> The repeat of " criminal " and handwritten comments in the margins frighten me even four decades later . " Red Squad " at the top of the first page . There they were in the sixties , crouched , aiming their weaponry at Reds . It reminded me of other Red Scare times : World War I and the deportation of a third of the Italian immigrant population ; the McCarthy era , and the fleeing of moviemakers and poets . I felt like the billboards of Sherwin-Williams paint , an open can spilling red on the globe of the world . To the Red Squad , whoever they were , I am also colored in crimson . <br> Everything I think about the present and the past will be dictated by the enclosures of that envelope . Why was it sent to me ? A reminder , a threat ? I filed no Freedom of Information request . In fact , I have spent these years distancing myself from that time . <br> Now and Then : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my students in that dreaded Comp 101 to write outlines . Here is mine in regards to this odyssey : <br> The Bullpen <br> Frozen Contract <br> Laughter and Subversive Planning <br> Meetings <br> The Cast of Heroic and Villainous Characters <br> Partying on Down <br> False Arrest <br> Finking on Faculty <br> The Home of Mr. and Mrs. Farmer <br> Bullpenner Disappears <br> The Betrayal <br> War Testimony <br> Bullpenners Dispersed <br> The New War <br> Street Marches <br> Reunion of the Bullpenners <br> The Fates Spin , Measure , and Shear <br> Somewhere in the long list there had to be room for " Passion , " for we were in our midtwenties , away from home , and full of longing . <br> NOW , 2000+ <br> I lift the sheets from the envelope and look closely at the listing of names . As I name the accused out loud , their faces emerge like flash cards . <br> They are our younger selves but filled with idealistic purpose . Some have stayed within the classroom , emerging for the arrival of the annual Modern Language Association meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or NYC . Others have dropped from academic sighting , not serving on boards , no longer read in the scholarly journals . They 've been content to go local , showing up in Georgia at the Southeast Modern Language Association or the Midwest MLA in Laredo , Kansas . <br> Some we lost : the amateur harpsichordist , the pregnant assistant professor . Recently , there was recognition of one of us , not of name but of face , on the front page of the national press . <br> But all of us were under suspicion . <br> Then : The Frozen Contract <br> Ron Ivory , ironic surname , was the first Black instructor in the English department ( his thesis : " The Influence of Color in the Victorian Novel " ) . He found the contract offering him tenure also frozen to the porch . He had previously been summoned by our chairman ( " Nineteenth-Century English Writers in Davos , Switzerland " ) , who sat so icily behind his desk that Ron knew the chairman had been outvoted by the Tenure Committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged in the offices of the other instructors who had completed their oral presentations and dissertations . Space was the problem in the more private offices , he was told . <br> An extra desk was shoved into our Pen , scraping against O'Dwyer 's . <br> " I hope you do n't mind , " Ron apologized . <br> Soon , O'Dwyer did n't mind at all . <br> At first we were cautious , treating Ron either as royalty or native . Then we became casual and profane . Ron rolled with it . Until he rolled right out of there . <br> Why did Ron buy a gun ? Was it the concealed or revealed racism ? Was it his living in the heart of the city without family ? ( But none of us , except for the married Farmers , had family . ) Or being of small stature ? Or simply his ebony color ? <br> To us , his former Bullpenners , Ron made light of ( intentional pun ) circumstances . We heard him in the Bullpen conversing in French with a graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshmen , waiting for remedial help , watched with amazement . <br> " Do you people speak French ? " he asked Ron . <br> " You people " speak the language of diplomacy ? <br> I inadvertently discovered Ron registering for a gun at Sears , Roebuck , where Guns abutted Household Appliances . He looked up at me from the form he was filling out and said nothing . It would turn out later that Ron would not be the only alarmed and , therefore , armed person in the English department . <br> Ron took the stiff contract and used it as leverage . He was the first and only one of us to leave the Bullpen with the revenge of being hired from an inner-city university by a prestigious eastern college . <br> Ron returned regularly for his friend O'Dwyer , as well as Detroit music and a royal visit to the Pen . <br> We got on , Ron and I. <br> " ' Sugar Pie , Honey Bunch , ' " he greeted me . He never said anything personal . Motown , the Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " How 's ' My Girl ' ? " he would ask , then sing , " ' My girl , my girl , talkin ' ' bout my girl . ' " ( Or Smokey Robinson for the Temptations . ) <br> " How 's ' My Guy ' ? " Ron asked O'Dwyer . <br> Looking at Kevin out of the corner of my eye , I sang , " ' Nothing you can say could tear me away from my guy ( my guy ) . ' " <br> " ' My Guy , ' ' My Girl , ' " said Farmer . " Maybe Smokey swung both ways . " <br> We were surprised to hear from Farmer . We thought of him as bluegrass . Farmer had never impressed Ron . " Everybody listen . A Farmer is speaking , " said Ron . <br> Farmer was skinny . You could see the shape of bony knees beneath his pants . His face had no cheeks and thin lips . But he was flexible , rhythmic in that skeletal frame . <br> Bernstein showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With his long nose , wiry hair , and rounded shoulders , he was the Pen Yid . <br> Kevin , the physical opposite of Bernstein , swiveled his desk chair and smiled . Motown was new to him , and he was open to it . The Irishman ( A for biggest , most muscled ) in the Pen was also ( C ) , the most innocent among us . <br> " How about ' Shotgun ' ? " Farmer persisted . " ' Buy yourself a shotgun ! ' " he sang . " Is n't that radical ? " he asked . <br> " Are you saying that Jr . Walker and the All Stars were inciting ? " asked Ron . " Right there in full view , in Detroit ? " <br> Or did Farmer , too , know about Sears basement level and Ron 's purchasing a gun ? <br> Ron came to us but never we to him . Maybe trust can only go so far . <br> Continues ...              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
