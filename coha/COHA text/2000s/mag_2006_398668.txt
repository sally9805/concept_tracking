Section : International The poisoning of a Kremlin critic has the world asking how dangerous Moscow has become . <p> Alexander Litvinenko said a lot of outrageous things when he was alive . He claimed that Al Qaeda 's No. 2 , Ayman al-Zawahiri , was a Russian agent . He alleged that he had a tape of Russian President Vladimir Putin having sex with another man . And he declared , just before dying , that his enemies in the FSB , Russia 's secret service , had poisoned him in order to silence him . Some of Litvinenko 's allegations were hard to believe . But as British and FBI investigators followed a radioactive trail left by the deadly isotope , polonium 210 , that killed the Russian exile on Nov. 23  --  finding traces of it on planes from Moscow to London  --  they began to believe he might have been on to something . Litvinenko , hairless and ghostly pale , had devoted his last minutes of consciousness to fingering the FSB and Putin himself . " You have shown yourself to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the former FSB lieutenant colonel turned dissident said on his deathbed . " The howl of protest from around the world will reverberate , Mr. Putin , in your ears for the rest of your life . " <p> The Kremlin called Litvinenko 's allegation " nothing but nonsense . " Putin himself dismissively suggested that Litvinenko might have been " sacrificed " by his dissident allies as a ploy to cast blame on Moscow . British investigators last week cautioned that they had turned up nothing that led to any particular suspect . Some suggested that Litvinenko 's poisoning was done too sloppily for the culprit to have been the FSB , the successor to the fabled KGB . Professional hits are supposed to be neat , quiet affairs . But so many traces of polonium 210 were found in London restaurants , hotels and posh neighborhoods like Mayfair that British tabloids began to run radiation scare ! headlines . Authorities said some 33,000 British Airways passengers may have been exposed , though the health risks were considered minor . <p> Still , the fears in London reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place Russia has become . Grown richer on gas and oil profits , an increasingly haughty Russia has begun to behave like an international bully , U.S. and European officials complain . After a decade in which it meekly accepted its status as a second-rate power , Russia has cut off fuel supplies to the Europeans , strong-armed former Soviet satellites like Ukraine and Georgia , obstructed Washington over sanctions against Iran and harassed U.S. companies in Russia . <p> Equally worrisome , Russia has become a nation where corruption is systemic , where the only order and security come from bribes and protection rackets and contract killings are as common as buyouts on Wall Street . Politics and profits are so intertwined that top Kremlin officials control some of the country 's biggest companies . Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev is also chairman of Gazprom , the $220 billion gas monopoly . Presidential administration deputy chief Igor Sechin is head of the giant state oil company , Rosneft , and Putin aide Viktor Ivanov chairs national air-carrier Aeroflot , as well as the main air-defense contractor , Almaz-Antei . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an oligarchy drawn from the secret police , " says former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov , referring to the KGB background of many of Putin 's advisers . Indeed , some U.S. and European officials suggest that Putin 's Russia now has the characteristics of a fascist state . " There 's no longer a sense that Russia is just on the other side of the divide but still within the family , " says Stephen Sestanovich , a former top Russia adviser in Democratic and Republican administrations . " The Russians are no longer the errant cousins . They 're looking like a different gang altogether . " <p> One thing is certain : enemies of the Kremlin and its many business interests have been turning up suspiciously dead lately . A month before Litvinenko 's murder , journalist Anna Politkovskaya , a critic of Putin 's war in Chechnya , was shot to death at her Moscow apartment . The Litvinenko poisoning was the most brazen attack yet , occurring in the heart of London in early November . Despite the failure to find a culprit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that most theories pointed back to Russia . <p> Most experts agreed that the killer 's use of polonium 210 was the hardest evidence tying the assassination to elements inside the Russian government . In the quantity that killed Litvinenko , the obscure isotope could be obtained only from a nuclear reactor or a nuclear-powered sub . " It is not at all easy to get hold of , " says Boris Zhukov , head of the radioisotope laboratory of the Russian Academy of Sciences ' Nuclear Research Institute . " And absolutely impossible outside state control , at least in Russia . " Some U.S. and British intel sources , however , suggest the polonium 210 that killed Litvinenko could have come from some place besides Russia . <p> According to a classified U.S. intelligence bulletin on the case that was described to NEWSWEEK , one theory among many is that the culprits could be rogue elements of the FSB . A possible suspect is a quasi-mythical group called Dignity and Honor , an alleged organization of ex-spies who target Kremlin critics on their own initiative . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had in Latin America , of former KGB special units who are experienced in war , intelligence and murder , " says Aleksei Venediktov , director of Ekho Moskvy , a prominent radio station , and one of Moscow 's best-connected commentators . " These people lost everything in ' 90s . They felt betrayed first by Boris Yeltsin and then by Putin . Beginning in about 1998 , they formed private groups , radical and militarized . Their aim is to kill enemies of the motherland . " ( One case is under investigation , though no murders have yet been conclusively tied to such groups . ) <p> But if Putin was blameless in the Litvinenko killing , he did n't exactly jump into the investigation , either . " Why is n't Putin saying , ' This is awful and we will help you track the responsibility wherever it goes ' ? " asks Sestanovich . " Their own words and actions here convict them , if not of direct responsibility then at least of an approach and attitude toward a crime like this that is way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rogue FSB killers , one senior U.S. official who deals with Russia cautioned against making the same mistake President Truman once did when he remarked that " poor Stalin " was a " prisoner of the Politburo . " Putin , a former KGB colonel , " is a very smart man ; he keeps his eye on detail , " said the official , who would speak about the case only anonymously . <p> Even if the Russian president were n't directly involved in Litvinenko 's killing or other assassinations , it is clear that extremist elements in his security apparatus think they can act with impunity . Last June , after the murder of Russian diplomats in Iraq , Russia 's rubber-stamp Parliament authorized assassination of " terrorists " anywhere in the world  --  not that the lack of such a law stopped the KGB ( or indeed FSB ) in the past . Vladimir Ryzhkov , a deputy in Russia 's Duma , believes that the motive in murders like Litvinenko 's is " not to just get rid of individuals , but to lead a psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The message is , ' You are next ' . " But most contract murders in Russia tend to be disputes over money , not politics , investigators say . <p> U.S. officials caution that not all is going bad with Russia . Moscow is cooperating on nuclear nonproliferation and recently agreed to terms for entry into the World Trade Organization . President George W. Bush still has " a very good personal relationship " with Putin , says a senior Bush administration official who would talk only on condition of anonymity . " They can discuss anything . " <p> Even so , U.S. officials fear that corporate interests have become so dominant in Russia that the West can no longer depend on statesmanlike behavior out of Moscow . Many senior Kremlin figures , for example , have strong financial interests in continuing to trade nukes and conventional weapons with Iran . " The only institution that works in Russia anymore is the Kremlin , " says the U.S. official who deals with Moscow . Whether the Kremlin is also working to silence its critics may be a secret that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say <p> Alexander Litvinenko is the latest in a line of Kremlin critics who have mysteriously come to grief . A look at some of the major cases : SERGEI YUSHENKOV Parliament member/co-chair , Liberal Russia Party <p> A member of the commission investigating the 1999 apartment bombings , he was shot dead outside his Moscow apartment in April 2003 , A rival LRP leader was later convicted of ordering his murder . YURI SHCHEKOCHIKHIN Parliament member/journalist <p> Another member of the group investigating the 1999 bombings , he was also looking into high-level corruption allegedly involving FSB . He died of a sudden illness in July 2003 . Doctors called it allergic shock , refusing to give the family more details . Police said there was no crime to investigate , but some believe he was poisoned . VIKTOR YUSHCHENKO Ukrainian politician <p> Ran for president of Ukraine against a Kremlin- backed opponent . Sudden illness forced him to leave the campaign trail in September 2004 . Doctors later determined he had been poisoned with dioxin , which left his face disfigured . Still , he survived and won . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Began fearing for her life after becoming ill while on her way to cover the 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis in southern Russia . She later wrote that medical evidence in her case had been destroyed on orders " from on high . " In October 2006 , she was shot dead in the elevator of her building . No arrests have been made .
