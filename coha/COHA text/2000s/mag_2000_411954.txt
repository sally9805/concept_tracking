BOY OR GIRL always feels very proud of the playhouse that he or she builds in the backyard . You can build the playhouse shown in Figure 1 easily , I know , because it is quite like a playhouse I built when I was six years old . You may not need a lot of help , but if a parent wants to hold this or that part of the framework when you are putting it up , let them do it . One reason why the house is so easy to build is that it is made of light-weight lumber . This is possible because the building is only 7 feet wide , 4 feet deep , and 7 feet high . The rear wall is built against the back fence , so the next-door neighbors will not object . It has two strong corner posts 2 inches thick and 4 inches wide , known as 2-by-4s . These are nailed or stapled to the fence , and another 2-by-4 is nailed to their tops , as shown in Figure 2 , for a top plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front wall is built flat upon the ground , as shown in Figure 3 , then raised and fastened in place . Its corner posts and the vertical posts in between are called " studs . " They need not be more than 1 inch thick and 2 inches wide , known as 1-by-2s , though 1-by-4s or 2-by-2s would make a stiffer framework . They should be G feet long . Old lumber will do , if you can get it . If the pieces are larger than listed above , no matter . New material can be bought at a hardware store . Boards from wooden fruit crates , or pallets ( sometimes called " skids " ) are good enough for covering the wall framework . You can get fruit crates at grocery stores . Hardware stores may have wooden pallets or skids . Knock the fruit crates or pallets apart carefully , so as not to split the boards ( you may want an adult 's help with this part ) . Remove all the nails from the boards . If you can get two boards 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom boards of the front wall ( Figure 3 ) . Nail them to the corner studs . Then place a stud 12 inches inside of each corner . Leave spaces of 20 inches wide for the door and window openings . Of course , the spacing at the top and bottom must be alike . Place another pair of studs between the door and the window ; make the studs 12 inches apart . With the studding fastened at both ends ; you can get the measurements for cutting the boards . Sort out your fruit crate or pallet boards so there will be the least possible waste in cutting , Cut one piece of each length required , and use it as a pattern for marking and sawing the other pieces . Five feet should be high enough for your doorway . The top of the window should be level with the top of the doorway ( see Figure 1 for window placement ) . The windowsill should be about 30 inches below the tap of the window Fasten the boards with 4-penny nails , and if their ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hammer them over . The front wall is connected to the rear wall with the rafters . These may be 1-by-2s if placed on their narrow edges , not more than 16 inches apart ( Figure 4 ) . The rafters over the doorway should project 16 inches past the front wall , in order to support a canopy . The other rafters should project G inches past the front wall , to support the eaves . You can find the correct lengths of the rafters after positioning the front wall 4 feet away from the rear wall . You will need a stepladder for this overhead work . If a parent or older brother or sister is standing by , you might have him or her hold the front wall while you climb up and position and nail the rafters in . With the rafters set , put in the studs of the side and rear walls . The spacing will be determined by the lengths of boards you have for covering them . After you finish the side and rear walls , you 're ready for the roofing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the side walls . Boards will not make a water-tight roof by themselves . They must be covered with shingles , roofing paper , or metal . If you use roofing paper , put it on in strips , as shown in Figure 1 . Before laying the floor inside the playhouse , dig a hole and set a metal box or tin container in it for a treasure chest or hiding place . Then leave one or two boards loose for a secret trap door . To make the floor , make some floor studs , or " joists , " by fastening some 1-by-4s on their edges ( like the rafters ) , about 12 inches apart , between the front and rear walls . Once the joists are in place , nail the floor boards across them . A window " sash , " or frame with the glass already in it , is not necessary . You could always build window shutters out of boards instead . But , if you can get an old sash , and can make the opening the right size to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one edge of the sash to a wall stud , as shown in Figure 5 , and screw a wooden button , made as shown in Figure 6 , to the opposite stud , for a lock . Figure 7 shows how the door is made . Use boards of the full length of the door , if you can get them , and fasten them with the two horizontal " battens " and one diagonal batten , as shown . It will probably require three hinges to hang the door . Make a wooden button for locking it on the inside . Make a handle for the outside of the door , as shown in Figure 8 , and if you can get a trunk handle ( Figure 9 ) , screw it to the door , as shown in Figure 1 , for a knocker . The two narrow strips of wood across the door represent strap hinges . Be sure to give the house at least a first coat or primer " coat of paint . If your allowance will go far enough , get enough paint for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat . Make a front step of bricks or stone , as shown in Figure 1 . Build a sidewalk of stones , if desired . To make your playhouse look even more real , hang a flower box below the window . // <p>
