Maybe the whole thing could be accounted for by the year , 1971 : how we-well , I-woke at three in the morning with a runny sensation that something , somebody , was missing , and wandered out to the living room where my childhood sweetheart , the love-of-my-life Richie , was supposed to be sleeping on the couch . He was gone . He had n't even shut the door all the way . I leaned out the front window and caught sight of him crossing Broadway between iooth and lo/th , jaywalking behind a Daily News delivery truck in his bare feet . He was naked except for his underwear , white huggies with holes in back I could see even from six flights up . <p> Thank God it was spring : a warm spring , almost a year since Kent State and nine months since the draft lottery for guys born in 1951 . Richie was number 37 , which meant he had to either stay in school or ship out to Vietnam , but he 'd got himself tangled up in some Weathermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told us a few hours before , over a bowl of chili . It was hard to say exactly how much beer we 'd drunk at that point : he and JeanPaul kept popping up to go buy another bottle of Miller High Life , the pair of them insisting , No , man , it 's on me . Mainly they wanted to put some distance between each other . All guys were like that , I thought then , like the city dogs you 'd see on the sidewalk or in Riverside Park , shepherds and huskies on little leather leads , their owners holding them back when another dog passed and hissing , Is he male ? Is he male ? Cause if he 's male ... <p> If he 's male , my dog 'll go for blood , and here 's fair warning . Well , we had no warning from Richie . He just rang the buzzer downstairs , and the next thing I knew he was at the apartment door , the two of us hugging and bawling . Jean-Paul was n't home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my height and rub up against me the way he used to do when we were fourteen and fifteen and sixteen . I half-wanted him to make all the other moves , too , the tongue in my mouth and the one-handed breast squeeze , but he did n't , he just held on for dear lustful life . <p> " Twenty years old , Feeney ? Frigging married ? Where 's the little tyke ? " <p> " Richie , I was n't pregnant . That 's not the only reason people get married . " With his breath on my neck , though , I could n't remember what the other reasons were . Jean-Paul and I had been planning to move in together , but my father had lung cancer in a bad way and my mother said she 'd slam the door in my face if I showed up , unwed and cohabitating , to visit him . So while the rest of the world cavorted in- communes , here we were in a minuscule claustrophobic apartment , lawfully wed . <p> And here was Richie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeves rolled to his elbows . Over the fifth or sixth quart of beer he asked Jean-Paul-not me-if he could crash : " We got a safe house lined up in Brooklyn . Park Slope , man , a duplex this chick is renting for us , only the owner 's sniffing around . Two days , maybe three ? I 'd really appreciate it . " <p> " Must be weird to be back in New York , " Jean-Paul said , noncommittal . He did n't like the Weather Underground , and he did n't like the idea of the feds showing up at our door . <p> " Dig it . But I could n't stay in Madison with this shit going down . Cozy in my safe little school with Kissinger napalming every country in Southeast Asia ? " Richie was n't the least concerned about insulting those of us who 'd stayed in our safe little schools . We still did n't know exactly what he 'd done , but when I leaned in to ask , Jean-Paul signaled with his eyebrows to keep still : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . <p> " Just do n't go blowing anybody up . " I pictured the front page of the News when they blew up that townhouse in the Village : a nail bomb , and three of them dead . Rich kids , Jean-Paul said . <p> Richie could be pretty reckless , but now he gave me his Agony in the Garden look . " We look at every action from every angle , man . I guess there 's not a lotta politics in a theater department . " <p> " There 's enough , " Jean-Paul said . The truth was , he was the most political guy I knew , but he was full of contempt for the hotheads who said they were going out to smash up the Bank of America : the Richies . You watch , he always said . They 'll be working for the Bank of America ten years from now . <p> " We 've been doing some good street theater , " I said , but even to me it sounded like my little-girl voice . <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Jean-Paul was glowering by then . Richie was a ballplayer-a pitcher , tall and muscular-and he was a talker , a snorter , a stand-up guy who 'd just walked away from his Wisconsin scholarship to get messed up in whatever he was messed up in . He did n't have a lot of patience for the Jean-Pauls of the world , and the Jean-Pauls-the ones who went on the marches but would n't smash the windows-always looked like they were trying to figure out if they could take him down . The answer was : no . Jean-Paul was dark and intense and good-looking , the lead in the last three main-stage productions , but his hair was cut short for Waiting for Lefty and he was skinnier than I was . Next to Richie , next to those big biceps and the big nose and the big mouth , he looked a little nebbishy and sour . He was 4-F : a heart murmur . <p> " Sure , you can stay , " he said . " I 'm going out for another quart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and grinned , and hoisted his jelly jar . " Thanks , man . " Jean-Paul did n't grin back . <p> Five years later we moved to Brooklyn ourselves . Back then , when you could still afford it , Park Slope was the destination for all the refugees , all the failed artists and actors and opera singers , and it was crawling with radicals , too . Even before I got pregnant I had a lot of downtime to wander , to search for Richie in the health food store and the big library at Grand Army Plaza and on the ball fields in Prospect Park . I looked all the time , at any tall swarthy male , and for a while I started to see him behind beards and under yarmulkes and once , even , beneath a Sikh turban . I bought every Bruce Springsteen album , to study the pictures , because Bruce had the same moves as Richie , and I had an idea they 'd age the same way . Every time I heard a siren in the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his new life as a social worker or a labor organizer . Sometimes the last thing I saw before I fell asleep was Richie behind prison bars , Springsteening to imaginary music . <p> He was n't in Park Slope anymore , or I would have seen him . I would have known him even if he 'd had plastic surgery or dressed as a circus clown . He was probably up on some farm in New Hampshire or out in the Northwest working a fishing trawler . When they started finding people in the nineties-Sara Jane what 's her name-I held my breath . I knew what I was doing . Dreaming about Richie , fixating on him , was the safest fantasy a long-married mother of three could possibly have , and anyway I only used the idea of him when Jean-Paul and I were so sick of each other we could spit , or kill each other , or both . Then I 'd start looking all over again : he was the one , my grand passion , my Heathcliff , my Vronsky , my roll-me-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't blown anybody up . I bought every book on the last days of the SDS to look for his name , but after September nth I could n't even turn the pages . Anyway , I never found his name . <p> But I found him , one rush-hour morning when I was n't looking at all . He was way down at the front end of the subway platform , the Manhattan-bound D train , wearing a well-cut suit . Very well-cut : Armani , maybe . It could have been a million prosperous guys , and it could only have been him . I moved down the platform for a better look , but the train pulled in and I only had time to focus on a manicured left hand , holding the door for a woman in a tight skirt . No wedding ring-but then Jean-Paul and I did n't wear wedding rings , either , because the ones we bought in the Village were so cheap they split the first time we slammed our hands down in anger . My shortness of breath alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere : in the Key Food if I ran in for a quart of milk , coming out of Ozzie 's with a cup of coffee . He was always dashing away-avoiding me ? Still hiding ? I was sure it was Richie . That nose , and the same wavy hair , graying and receding now , but scissor-cut , feathered , long on the neck . An expensive haircut , and an expensive suit , more of a disguise than a Sikh turban . I mean , the Richie Daccapo I knew tied his hair back with a piece of dirty string . <p> The Richie Daccapo I knew lived next door on Long Island , in Hicksville ( no kidding ) , and when we were five and six and seven you could n't have pried us apart with the Jaws of Life . I do n't even remember going to school when I was that age , I only remember running with Richie out to the hot empty fields where I stood with my wooden bat , pretending I might actually hit the ball , while Richie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were six-year-old lovers , more in tune with each other than anybody who 's ever passed through the dark night of puberty . Not that it was sexless : it was all sex , pulling down shorts behind rhododendron bushes to show each other body parts and touch them and maybe even kiss them : the taste of salt , the smell of my mother 's Clorox . When she threw me into the tub at night she snapped , Do n't touch yourself , do n't touch your body . What have you been learning from that boy ? <p> My mother called the Daccapos coarse : the language . Their friggings floated through the patio doors , and Richie 's father wore a sleeveless undershirt-how coarse could you get ? Actually it was one of the few fashion differences between him and my father , who had , by coincidence , also gone to Fordham night school . Now they were numbers guys ( Mr. Daccapo an accountant , Mr. Feeney an actuary ) , steady faithful family guys who rose at five-thirty to catch the six-forty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reach ( Winstons for Feeney , Marlboros for Daccapo ) , the Zippos lying on top . Richie alternated whose lighter he stole . <p> We were the gang leaders , Billy the Kid and Pocahontas , hiding in small places , clinging to each other . Where 's my frigging lighter ? Our fathers lay on their couches , dead men listening to Huntley-Brinkley and cough cough coughing , thick yellow phlegm , exhausted worn-out coughs . We crouched between the couch and the wall , squeezing each other , squeezing the Zippo . Maybe we already knew they were n't going to make it . Richie 's father dropped dead of a heart attack on the Long Island Railroad when he was forty-four years old . Five years later , my father went in for the chest x-rays . <p> I can see Mr. Daccapo out in the backyard , the dark hair lush under his arms . He 's standing by his new gas grill , his altar , one hand on the cover as if to assure himself that it 's all his , or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at him . He just stands there in the dead center of the yard , touching his grill , blissed out . Finally he lifts his hand to shake a Marlboro from the pack and tear the filter off . He 's a goner . <p> I had to shake Jean-Paul awake-all that beer-and when I said Richie was down on Broadway just about naked , gon na get himself killed , he looked at me with that blank look he had already perfected . I said : " Okay , okay , I 'll go myself , only do n't yell at me if somebody drops a bottle on my head . " The Upper West Side still had SROs on every block , and the winos dropped their empties out the windows . My mother could n't believe we lived like that . <p> " I 'll go , " he said , in that male-dog voice , that low flat growl that says I 'll go and means and if I catch up with him I 'll kill him while I 'm at it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean-Paul slipped from sight , jogging east . I was surprised to see him running : I thought he 'd just walk around the block once and come back to say Richie was long gone . At this hour even Broadway was deserted , open season for the muggers . <p> After forever the two of them came back into the frame of the window , Richie stooping , trying to hide his tall nakedness behind short Jean-Paul . My guilty little heart beat hard . We 'd only been married five months , and already I was comparing one body to the other . <p> Richie was wild-eyed when he came through the door in his underwear , exhilarated , drunker than when he 'd gone to bed drunk . " This guy frigging saved my skin . " He put an arm around Jean-Paul 's neck , but Jean-Paul picked it off : a bug , a louse . " Your old man hauled off and hit me . " <p> " Somebody had to stop you . Where 'd you think you were going ? " <p> Richie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something came out of his nose . " I have no frigging idea . Listen , man , thanks for coming after me . Cause if they picked you up with me . . . " <p> We were all wide awake , taking that in . Richie pulled on jeans over his holey BVDs . With his hair down and just the one lamp on , he looked younger than he had all night , maybe a little panicked . " And Feeney , thank God you knew what the deal was-she ever tell you about her sleepwalking days ? She was famous for it , man . She used to make tracks . She used to wan na get out of town . " <p> It was true . I did make tracks : I ran for my life . I 'd wake in a sandlot circling the bases , my parents ' robes flapping behind me . They screwed bigger and bigger chains higher and higher on the front door , but no chain could hold me : I dragged a stool over , and I busted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , someone always tore downstairs after me , but always too late , always a swing behind . I was gone , I was out of there . <p> I was eight , nine , ten those sleepwalking years , the years when the gang split in two , when some of the boys could actually hit Richie 's pitches and I was stuck with the girls and their pointybreasted Barbies . My mother did n't understand why I punished my dolls with needles and buried them up to their necks . Next door Richie and his men put all their green toy soldiers in the new grill with firecrackers and watched them pop-pop-pop , privates gooing all over the rack : excellent practice for the militant wing of the SDS . That night we heard Mr. Daccapo frigfrigfriging at the top of his lungs , and once we saw him chase Richie down the street with a broom , Richie 's voice rising and falling and cracking , a little sob at the end when his father caught up with him . <p> " I get it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feeney 's pad , I associate Feeney with sleepwalking , I sleepwalk myself . " <p> " I 'll put the chain on . " I knew a chain would n't hold Richie , either , but when it was safe in its slot he closed his eyes . <p> Jean-Paul and I crept back to the little bedroom . " You really hit him ? " Under the sheets , we lay a million miles apart . <p> " You 're lucky I did n't strangle him . " <p> The second time he left I heard him rattle the chain , just the way my parents used to hear me , but I was too late . The elevator was already whirring , and Jean-Paul 's shoes were already tied . He headed for the stairwell without a goodbye , as if he held me responsible for this sleepwalk of Richie 's . Maybe I was . <p> This time I was n't staying behind . I slipped into sneakers that had long since lost their laces and took off after them . I was wearing what I wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd scooped out and tied around my neck , no bra in the daytime , and no panties at night . In the dark of night , I could get arrested , too . <p> I had no idea which way they 'd gone so I followed a hunch and headed south on Broadway . At 105th I thought maybe I saw them on the east side of the street , two guys trucking along one after the other . I broke into a noisy run , my loose shoes slapping the sticky sidewalk . It was a cool twitchy muggy night . Broadway smelled of rotting vegetables . The harder I ran , the harder it was to breathe , but up ahead Jean-Paul had almost caught up to Richie , and I had almost caught up to the pair of them . <p> I put on one last push , but as soon as I was within reach I spied a cop hanging out at the top of the subway stairs across poth Street . I slowed to a walk just as Richie , barefoot and bare-chested , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walked right up to the cop and clasped him on the shoulder . Was he awake ? Was he turning himself in ? <p> I thought that Jean-Paul would turn around then , but he was a steady faithful guy and he never missed a stride . Crossing 96th , he followed Richie right up to the cop arid put his own arm around Richie 's shoulder . From my shadow I could make out a pale wary hand flexing on a nightstick . <p> They stood there forever . I planned my run back home , my calls to find a lawyer for the fugitive and his accomplice . My mother would die . I had n't said a real prayer since eighth grade , but I heard myself chant Hail Mary three times , fast . Lo and behold , the cop swept Richie and Jean-Paul down the street with both hands and then sauntered away . <p> I reversed course , shamed that I had n't gone to back up JeanPaul , and scooted from shadow to shadow till they caught up with me . Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iosth and Richie keened : " What am I frigging doing ? What is this , like a death march ? " <p> " Death march is a little melodramatic . Let 's just shut up till we 're back inside . " <p> We did n't even talk on the elevator . Inside , the door safely latched , Jean-Paul enunciated every word as if Richie were hard of hearing or stupid or both : " What we 're going to do is we 're going to pile stuff in front of the door . " He got to work on a fortress of books and LPs while Richie and I sat stunned on the couch . Pretty soon he had most of our worldly possessions blocking Richie 's path . He topped off the pile with the banged-up pots and pans from his father 's restaurant , to clang out if Richie got anywhere close . <p> Richie still did n't look fully conscious . " Time is it , four-thirty ? I better sit up , man . How could I do that , go looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit up . You 're not getting out of here . " Jean-Paul played the line just right , world-weary , and exited for the bedroom . <p> Richie let a long shudder run the length of his body and picked up my hand to lay it on his chest , so I could feel his heart galloping . Then he leaned his head back into the cushions and pulled me close . He tripped his fingers through my hair , curling it strand by strand the way he used to when we sat on the back steps . Our breathing slowed , our breathing sped up . <p> " What did you say to him ? " <p> " The cop ? I said Peace , baby . Your husband told him I was a frigging frat boy at Columbia who had too much to drink . " <p> " Just do n't go blowing anybody up , Richie . " I snuggled into him the way I used to all those afternoons after his father died and we sat out back trying to make sense of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melt onto him . " What if I have a frigging breakdown ? What if you have to take me to the emergency room ? " I could feel more than his heart rising . He took my hand to lay it on his jeans , on his doggy cockiness . He was n't so scared after all . <p> From the bedroom the springs squealed : Jean-Paul shifting on the mattress . Only the little kitchen separated us . He could hear every word Richie groaned out , and every word I answered . I jumped up and made my way back to our bed without another word . It was as if I were sleepwalking , too , only this time I came back home , locked myself in safe and sound , and nobody even knew I 'd gone missing . I 'd been about to sleep with him , my husband a room away . <p> Jean-Paul finally deigned to say one word , enunciated precisely , delivered without an excess of feeling : " Asshole . " <p> How could I tell Jean-Paul that Richie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't something you told your husband , it was something you swallowed , and once it was down your gullet you could keep other secrets , too . How could I tell Jean-Paul that all I dreamed of , for weeks before we married , was Richie Daccapo ? <p> One dinnertime the Daccapos got a knock on the door from an LIRR man . From the Feeney house we heard Richie 's sisters scream out No no , it 's not true , it 's not true . Even my mother , accustomed to high opera next door , was alarmed . She peered through all the windows trying to see what was going on . I stood behind her and watched Richie tear out the back door and make his way across the yard to the grill , the altar , the holy site . I thought he was going to put one hand on the cover , the way his father did , but instead he hammered it with his left fist . His pitching arm . I did n't once think about what I was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down the stairs , out the back door , through the rhododendrons . I hugged Richie from behind , hugged him with all the breath in my body . I knew it was his father , I knew his father was a goner , I 'd known it all along . How could he not have a heart attack , running after Richie with a broom ? For a while Richie kept punching the grill even with me hanging on his back , but I could feel him slowing down because I was there , because I wrapped my arms tighter and tighter around his waist . After a while he stopped and shook me off . " Why 'd he make all those jokes about colored people , why 'd he have to do that ? " <p> " I know . My mother hates Italians even . " <p> He went back in the house without another word , and I went back next door , and after a while you could hear them all settling down . " I 'm sorry he walked away from you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Good grief , " my father said . " His old man 's dead . Is he supposed to stop and chat ? " <p> " I know you have n't been the best of friends with Richie lately , " my mother said , ignoring my father as usual . " I know the family 's coarse . " <p> But when we walked into the wake Richie rose to comfort me , as if I were the mourner , and hugged me frontways , the proper way , the way we used to hug when we were small . And that was that , we were back , flesh against salty flesh , forever and always , fourteen and fifteen and sixteen , grieving Richie Daccapo the man of the house , his mother and his sisters driving him out of his frigging mind , but me , Joan Feeney , right next door , ready to snuggle and cuddle and smooch . Whatever we did , we would n't turn into our parents . <p> The night of our graduation , Richie told me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled through , night after exhausted night , a Jesuit school . You ought to get out , man , get real , get away from the frigging priests . Come to Madison , we 'll bust the place open . <p> I 'd been seeing him for months without his seeing me so maybe it should n't have surprised me that Richie had to get right up in my face while I was eyeballing paperbacks in the window of Community Books . " Feeney , I do n't believe it . What are you doing in Brooklyn ? " <p> " I live here . " It was so anticlimactic : a Yankees cap on a Saturday afternoon . He looked ten years younger than I did-tanned , oiled , massaged-and his hug was gym-toned . <p> " Hey , so do I. Got myself a sweet brownstone in a recession sale . " His Long Island accent , I noticed , had been diluted . The neighborhood where all the failures and the lefties came , thirty years ago , was full of guys who could afford Armani now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surer of himself , if that was possible . I was a wreck-my straw hair was woven with gray , and I was n't skinny anymore-but he leaned against the plate glass with all the time in the world . " It is so good to see you , " he said , and I sucked up every syllable . <p> " What do I call you now ? " <p> " You can call me Richie . You 're the only one I 'd let get away with it . " <p> " No , I mean . . . you did n't change your name ? " He looked at me as if I 'd lost my wits . " When you went underground ? " <p> He leaned his head back against the glass-you could hear a little clunk-and howled . " Oh my God . " <p> " You did n't go underground ? " <p> He wiped his eyes with the same fist that once slammed into his father 's gas grill . " I played at going underground for about three weeks , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was living in this neighborhood , actually , those three weeks . ' 72 ? ' 73 ? " <p> " ' 71 . Were n't they looking for you , was n't there a warrant ? " <p> He shook his head . " Two of my , uhm , buddies got nabbed in a stolen car . That was a nasty business , I regret that . My prints were all over everything . I was convinced they were looking for me . . . " <p> He saw the look on my face and lowered his voice : " My friends had plastique . " I 'm not sure exactly why I did n't believe him , but my heart swooped the same way it used to when I saw him sidling up to other girls . Plastique was supposed to evoke Euro-terror : Baader-Meinhof and the IRA . Richie wanted to paint a hyperromantic picture-as if I needed help with that . <p> " But you made it back for finals . " <p> " And into law school without a black mark to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing with yourself ? " <p> No underground ? No arrest warrant ? Law school ? One day he was fooling around with lightweight explosives , and the next day he was studying torts ? " I teach . " <p> " Acting ? " <p> I realized then that I was ashamed , that I had n't finished the sentence because I did n't want the well-dressed attorney to know what I did . " Middle school . You know , I thought maybe I saw you one morning on the D train . " <p> " I wish I 'd known , I would have bought you a cup of coffee . I ca n't tell you how many times I 've told the sleepwalking story . Maybe I could buy you that coffee right now . " <p> " Oh , I 'm sorry , " I said , though I had time to kill , my children long gone and Jean-Paul off at the restaurant . Immediately I regretted turning him down-who was being the snob ? " Why do n't you come over for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He did a little Springsteen swivel . " No wife at the moment , " he said , " and the girlfriend 's traveling . Might be a good night for catching up , huh ? " <p> When I called Jean-Paul on his cell , to tell him Richie Daccapo was coming to dinner , he said : " Who 's Richie Daccapo ? " But he remembered well enough when Richie showed up at the front door , or maybe he remembered how Richie affected me . The two of them started pawing the ground over drinks-too many drinks-and the three of us staggered through the apartment to the dinner table . <p> I was shocked at my middle-aged heart , thunkathunking over this guy I used to love . Jean-Paul doused him with questions , and Richie gave a lawyer 's cautious answers : he 'd been divorced for ten years now , his girlfriend was in Singapore , closing a deal . Jean-Paul would n't let up . Big firm ? Been there long ? Richie rolled his eyes , calculated : " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I blanched . For twenty years I 'd been seeing him on a fishing trawler . <p> " You 're a litigator ? " <p> " Mergers and acquisitions . I live and die by the numbers . " Richie flashed an ironic smile in my direction , to remind me that I might have turned the corner on fifty but I was still a teenage girl . <p> Jean-Paul had thrown together the food , though he rarely cooked at home : he was a chef now , in his father 's restaurant . We were working our way through avocado and endive , or at least Jean-Paul and I were . Richie had swallowed his salad down in two bites , as if to show how puny it was . He was giving Jean-Paul as good a third degree as he got : Where was the restaurant ? How many reviews ? How many stars ? <p> Jean-Paul spluttered at stars . Pascal was a little caf on the edge of Hell 's Kitchen . Actors went there . " I 'm not usually home Saturday night . Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest I should have insisted the opposite . " Whatever happened to the acting biz ? " <p> " We were bad actors , " I said . " Anyway , I was . Jean-Paul did- " <p> " Commercials , voiceovers . " He left it at that , left out how he went to Madison Avenue in the eighties and got laid off just after we bought the apartment , left out that going back to his father was the hardest thing he 'd ever done . We had three children by then . He sized Richie up again , from his end of the table-he 'd sat him down at the opposite end , so they could stare at each other properly . " You have kids ? " <p> " My partner makes maternal noises from time to time , but I 'm not sure I could bring any more kids into the world after 9/11 . " <p> That shut us all up . We did n't do the where were you thing-we 'd done it once too often . I 'd never once dreamed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Finally I said : " Our oldest , Paul-he 's in law school , you might appreciate this-got busted down in Washington , protesting the war . His dean really made him sweat it . " <p> " I guess he wo n't make that mistake again , " Richie said . <p> Jean-Paul said : " What mistake ? " <p> " Mistakes of our youth . " Richie gave me another almost-wink , but Jean-Paul was not amused . He got hot at the dinner table , even without Richie Daccapo sitting down at the other end . His family always chewed up religion and politics with their meals , the subjects forbidden in the Feeney household , and sometimes I thought that was why I married him . He cracked our windshield with his fist when he heard on the car radio that Reagan had fired the air traffic controllers . Our kids called him the Last Socialist : he was the guy who stayed up all night e-mailing urgent appeals for prisoners on death row . Now the Last Socialist calculated if he could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake , protesting Vietnam ? " <p> Richie raised his glass . " Here 's to the sixties . Here 's to those protests . " <p> " But not to these protests ? " Jean-Paul had just about worn himself out over this war . He 'd been to every march , got penned in on second Avenue , had a mounted cop rear up on him-just like the old days . <p> Richie flashed a rueful smile . " These are different days . A kid in law school 's got to be careful . " <p> " I ca n't believe it . After the kind of trouble you- " <p> Richie scraped his chair around , ducked his head in a way that was supposed to be modest and charming . " I was full of myself . " <p> " Well , our son 's not full of himself . " <p> " That 's not what I meant . " <p> " What did you mean , exactly ? " You could almost hear the two of them growling . They 'd stopped turning my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on each other . I was invisible : the middle-aged woman , the middle-school teacher , the monkey in the middle . <p> Richie pretended he was searching for the right words . " Anybody who plans to take the bar has to be cautious these days . After 9/11 ... " <p> " After 9/11 , maybe he feels the urgency . " <p> " Ah , youth . I remember ... " <p> " What do you remember ? Being on the lam ? " <p> " Well , what do you remember ? Letters to the editor ? " <p> " After 9/11 , " Jean-Paul said , and now you could see that his heart was the one thunkathunking , " it 's a pity to raise the body count . " <p> " My , you are the unrepentant liberal , are n't you ? " <p> It might have been the way he said my , the way he made JeanPaul sound so quaint and old-fashioned and womanish . Or maybe it was the liberal . Jean-Paul took his time , inhaled a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerks would be working for the Bank of America . " <p> Richie said : " I do n't work for the Bank of America . I 'm with Feckersham Wiltonberry Raft . " It was supposed to be a joke , I think . <p> " It was all just a rush for you , was n't it ? Making like you were out to save the world when you only wanted a cheap thrill . " <p> Richie snorted . " Cheap Thrills is a classic , and Joplin 's a saint . Otherwise , I do n't know what you 're talking about . " <p> " You know exactly what I 'm talking about . What 's a few innocent bystanders when this building blows ? What 's a few hundred workers laid off in this merger ? What 's a few Iraqi kids under this bomb ? " Jean-Paul had delivered his share of wine-induced diatribes over the years , but he 'd never been quite so sweeping . He rose , to make the pronouncement official . " I 'll have to ask you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my table . " <p> " Hey , now , did you hear me say I was a neocon ? I 'll have to ask you to stick to the facts as you know them . " <p> " The fact is , you were willing to get us all busted right along with you . And now you criticize our son , who 's out there putting his ass on the line . " <p> " I do n't like your tone . " When Richie rose from his own chair the room got still , but I could hear the little crackle you hear just before the light bulb explodes . I watched Jean-Paul hoist up his end of the table , watched the restaurant crockery and glasses go sliding down toward Richie . The hollandaise drooled onto his Saturday night black jeans : the only piece of clothing on him that Springsteen might have worn . Richie picked up the plate with the last clinging avocado slice and flung it back the length of the table , where Jean-Paul ducked precisely in the nick of time . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more lobs . " You were sleepwalking through Vietnam , too . " <p> Richie found another shard to hurl , hesitated . You could see him consider heaving the little guy , pitching him through the window . Then you could see him calculate the cost . He released a slider and turned his back . " Not the best reunion , Feeney , " he said . " Next time , my place . " <p> Jean-Paul hurled a wineglass from down below , but it did n't get close . " Not going to be a next time , asshole . " Richie was already halfway to the door , and then we heard the latch click . <p> " Well , " I said . " I 'm glad you got that out of your system . " <p> My husband rose painfully on his bad knees and beat his Wild Man chest . " I should have kicked him out thirty years ago , before he kept me up the whole damn night . " <p> " I 'm sorry , Jean-Paul . " Meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this night , about all the disappointment and bitterness we had accumulated through the years . Maybe I was sorry I was a middle-aged woman who still saw herself squeezed between two twenty-year-old boys . <p> " Well , I 'm not sorry . " He scooped everything into the tablecloth , the way they would have done at Pascal . He was exhilarated . " I 've got a long list of people I 'd like to throw a few dishes at . All those loudmouths who used to be leftier than thou . Why do n't you invite Paul Herman to dinner ? David Horowitz ? " <p> An hour later he was still pumped , full of adrenaline , ready to take off . From bed , twisting in the sheets , I watched him at his email . We ran a two-shift marriage , one of us always asleep before the other , but a long marriage , too : a steady faithful family guy . It was a miracle that he lived to be older than my father got to be . <p> We had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , literally : I wanted out of there , out of town . I went from bed to bed , touching my children 's foreheads . The next morning they told me how they woke to see their mad mother staring down , tracing their faces . One or the other always walked me back to my own bed , back to my husband 's side . Gracie , our middle child , caught me one night leaving the apartment . I was in my nightgown , but I 'd thought to grab my wallet . <p> " Why you think he went right up to that cop ? " <p> Jean-Paul did n't even stop typing . " Wanted to get caught . " Not a second 's hesitation . " Wanted somebody to stop him . " <p> The way I went to my children 's beds , so they would stop me . <p> But nobody stopped Richie . After his father died , his mother bought him a little fiat convertible with the insurance money , and he raced it faster and faster down the Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never said it out loud : maybe I did n't want to go that fast , and maybe I did . Please , you 're gon na get us killed . Ninety-seven , a hundred and two . Somebody 's gon na get hurt like this . A hundred and five , one-ten . He was the coolest guy in high school , the alpha male , girls hanging off him : he even got elected vice president of the Afro-American Society , though he did n't actually go to the meetings . I picked the one who went to the meetings , the one who married me when my father was dying , the one who wrote the e-mails late into the night . <p> The third time he went sleepwalking that night , Richie knew better than to get near the pile of pots and pans . He crawled into our bed instead , the way he might have crawled in with his parents when he was small ... or maybe he thought he was cavorting in some commune after all . When I woke at dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the other , their bodies rising with the sun : one heart racing , one heart murmuring , the heart in the middle ready to burst . <p> We were clinging to each other . We were kids on the run . <p>
