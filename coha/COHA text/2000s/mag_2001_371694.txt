In Afghanistan , nothing is ever what it seems . Including surrender . <P> On Nov. 24 , a bright , warm Saturday , 300 Taliban soldiers who had fled the American bombardment of Kunduz , their last stronghold in the north of Afghanistan , laid down their weapons in the desert a few miles to the north of Mazar-i-Sharif . They surrendered to Northern Alliance General Abdul Rashid Dostum , who crowed that his forces had achieved a " great victory " as the pows were herded 50 at a time onto flatbed trucks . <P> Even by the standards of Afghanistan 's warlords , Dostum has an unsavory reputation . In earlier episodes of Afghanistan 's wars , he was reputed to have killed those of his soldiers who broke the rules by tying them to the tracks of his tanks . But outside Mazar , his soldiers told their prisoners that Dostum wanted to make a gesture of reconciliation to help unite Afghanistan 's warring tribes .

" If we had searched them , there would have been a fight , " he said Wednesday , surveying hundreds of dismembered , blackened and crushed bodies . " But perhaps it would n't have been as bad as this . " <P> The Taliban fighters , many of whom were foreigners , were transported from the field of surrender to a holding site in Qala-i-Jangi , a sprawling 19th century prison fortress to the west of Mazar , where Dostum stabled his horses . The convoy of prisoners had to pass through the city center ; two weeks before , the Taliban had ruled the streets . The prisoners now peered out from under their blankets with shell-shocked , bloodshot eyes . The people of Mazar stared back at them with open hatred . <P> Things went wrong almost immediately . Once inside Qala-i-Jangi , the Taliban soldiers were asked to turn out their pockets . A prisoner , waiting until Alliance commander Nadir Ali was near , suddenly produced a grenade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a similar attack the same night , another prisoner killed himself and senior Hazara commander Saeed Asad . The remaining men were led into underground cells to join scores of other captured Taliban fighters . Despite the grenade attacks , the Alliance guards were not reinforced . <P> SUNDAY MORNING
