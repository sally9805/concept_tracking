Mentoring a preservice teacher is a collaborative process involving the student , the university faculty member , and the cooperating teacher <p> How can professors , teachers , colleagues , and administrators mentor preservice teachers toward professional growth ? How can music teacher education programs exemplify , generate , and nurture a culture of mentoring ? It seems self-evident that mentoring is an important topic in the professional development of teachers . The publication of Great Beginnings for Music Teachers : Mentoring and Supporting New Teachers 1 acknowledges MENC 's interest in the topic and articulates important strategies for addressing the needs of beginning teachers during the induction phase of their professional development . Even earlier than their first years in the classroom , however , preservice teachers can benefit from a mentoring environment while still students , as they begin to develop an identity with the role of teacher . <p> Enthusiasm for mentoring has not always been matched by clearly articulated purposes and goals . There is also concern , as Jeffrey Kimpton 2 observes , about the extent to which a " culture of mentoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . To what extent has the idea of mentoring become embedded in our thinking and practices ? For example , when we as faculty members meet and greet our preservice students inside and outside of class , are we consciously aware that each moment might be a mentoring moment ? Can we say with confidence that mentoring has become one of the profession 's mindful habits ? <p> This article examines the idea of mentoring and looks at the roles different individuals play in professional development within the preservice teacher education program . The major participants in the process are the preservice teacher , the college faculty members in the teacher education program who provide the foundational knowledge , and the practicing teachers who serve as cooperating teachers . All three must work collaboratively to develop and maintain a culture of mentoring . This culture should encourage preservice teachers to nursue continuing professional growth and connect preservice learning to the self-inquiry these new teachers should engage in throughout their teaching careers . Mentoring Essentials <p> From our perspective , mentoring for professional growth rests on empowering prospective teachers to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This approach acknowledges the perspectives preservice teachers hold about teaching and learning music , but it also encourages preservice teachers to go beyond their initial ideas . Teacher learning is an integral part of mentoring . Essential to mentoring is an understanding that professional growth is linked to the cultivation of key professional dispositions , such as the following : Deliberating on classroom practice dilemmas Questioning assumptions and values Attending to institutional and cultural contexts Taking initiative in curricular transformation Assuming personal responsibility for professional development. 3 The ideas of collaboration , transformation , and personal agency are essential to the entire process of creating a culture of mentoring . Creating a Culture for Mentoring <p> In An Orientation to Music Education : Structural Knowledge for Teaching Music , 4 Richard J. Colwell and Lizabeth B. Wing suggest that music teacher education programs are , by default , functionalist in their organization and approach to teacher socialization . In short , our programs tend to prepare the next generation of teachers in the same manner in which we were prepared , and tend primarily to reproduce the status quo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In contrast , reform-minded programs seek to transform the status quo and tend to view new teachers as the source of potential change . Preservice and new teachers carry the profession 's hopes and desires of creating transformational visions and teaching practices that unlock the " enormous potential of music education . " 5 <p> Teacher education programs are often structured around five general orientations to education : academic , technological , personal , critical , and practical. 6 By tradition , accumulation , and default , music teacher education programs tend to be an amalgam of all these perspectives , but they tend to emphasize the technological and the practical orientations . Our usage of terms such as teaching technique , mastery of standards , skill development , master-apprentice , experienced educator as expert , hierarchy of sequence , and so on exemplify the dominance of this technical-practical thinking in our programs , as well as its rationalist roots . Less apparent in our programs , however , are notions of learning associated with personal or critical orientations , as well as constructivist ideas . <p> The culture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our thinking so that it 's more in line with constructivist perspectives of learning . The foundational assumption about human learning that guides constructivist thought is that " learning means constructing , creating , inventing and developing our own knowledge . " 7 Orienting programs away from traditional master-teacher or technical models toward those focused on developing reflective practitioners may better prepare young teachers for innovation and inquiry-based forms of continuing professional development. 8 In addition , we see this theoretical foundation as sympathetic to personal and critical orientations . Table 1 compares constructs of learning in tradition-based programs with learning in constructivist-based programs . <p> Designing curricular and practical experiences based on a constructivist view requires not only rethinking program orientations , structures , and educational experiences , but rethinking the mentors main purpose and goals . Sharon Feiman-Nemser 's 9 reconceptualization of the teacher-educator image from master teacher toward educational companion or cothinker offers a compelling vision for working with preservice music teachers . Creating a culture for mentoring requires assuming a stance based on a concept of students and teachers as learners and collaborators . Initial Preparation : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the preservice years of teacher learning and seeks to help preservice students shift from the role of student to the role of teacher . Curricular experiences in the initial phases of preparation can be characterized by several interacting emphases : teacher identity and role development , teachers ' thinking and actions , and development of tools to study teaching . <p> Teacher identity . A landmark in teacher identity development occurs when students become aware of a shift in their roles , from students to teachers . Integral to this shift is the need for professors and students to develop and articulate a vision of good music teaching and what good music teachers do . One of the initial and continuing mentoring responsibilities of the teacher education program is to help teacher candidates critically examine the beliefs about teaching and learning they bring to the program , especially in relation to alternative ways of teaching that they never imagined . While affirming and extending images of teaching that promote equitable and meaningful learning , faculty must simultaneously challenge taken-for-granted assumptions preservice teachers have about the " best way to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song by rote , " for example . <p> Thus , it is crucial that faculty articulate visions of new possibilities and also model innovative ways of teaching and learning music . Dennis Theissen and Janet R. Barrett suggest helping preservice students begin to expand their thinking by looking at how music teachers do the following : work with learners , work in collaborative groups , engage in inquiry-based forms of professional learning , forge shared responsibilities for student learning among various stakeholders , and envision both teacher roles and subject matter conceptualizations as interdisciplinary and concerned with out-of-school connections. 10 <p> Teacher thinking and actions . It can be argued that influencing and shaping an individuals thinking and actions is one of the core purposes of the music teacher education program . It can also be argued that the music teacher education program should help preservice students develop an initial repertoire of teaching competencies , comprehend the various dimensions of music experience , understand student learning , and study the grounds on which they may build practice . <p> To accomplish these tasks , the music teacher education program must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning pedagogically . It is not enough simply to know the subject matter , possess superior musicianship , or just to " like kids . " One of the key roles that faculty in all school of music departments must play is that of helping preservice students frame musical skills and knowledge in ways that represent core ideas and processes , while recognizing their contextual and interrelated dimensions . Thus learning and teaching rhythm , for example , is not fundamentally about naming note values , or counting , or performing various durational sound-and-silence patterns . Rather , learning and teaching rhythm is about experiencing movement over time and understanding beat , durations , and durational patterns in relation to other musical dimensions . <p> A key mentoring strategy for helping preservice students reach this understanding of pedagogy is the critical analysis and evaluation of curricular materials : the generation , examination , testing , and reexamination of lesson plans constructed to immerse students in core musical ideas . In this process , the primary mentoring roles for faculty members are those of coach , critical friend , and coinquirer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " seeing , " helping them to discuss what they know and find a language for describing student understanding . As critical friends , faculty encourage and support preservice teachers ' thinking while challenging them to reexamine their initial practices and actions . Focused questioning ( on planning , content , method , sequence , and so on ) is the chief mode of interaction . As coinquirers , faculty look to their students as learning partners and as generators of personal concerns that can be investigated . The overall mentoring goal is to help preservice students become aware of the frameworks through which knowledge and skills are experienced and explained , processed by others , and communicated by teachers . <p> Tools for studying teaching . At root , the tools required for studying teaching rest on habits of mind or dispositions of curiosity , initiative , and inquiry . Skills in descriptive observation , analysis , interpretation , and evaluation are important and must occur within and across all aspects of the teacher education program . The acquisition of dispositions , however , is best cultivated within a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all members are supported and seen as integral ; creative , because it seeks and encourages new ideas ; and critical , because there is an expectation of rationality behind assertions and thoughts . Collaboration is both the mentoring goal and key strategy involved . A longer-term mentoring goal is to get students in the habit of engaging in inquiry-based teaching . In other words , teacher learning - seeing oneself as " teacher-as-learner " - is an outcome of the program . Practical Experiences : Cooperating Teachers ' Roles <p> Learning to teach is complex . Knowledge and understanding of both the complexity and developmental nature of teaching are essential for individuals who serve as cooperating teachers during the formal student-teaching phase of the teacher education program . Based on their work with student teachers in field-based settings , John Furlong and Trisha Maynard have illustrated how different mentoring roles and strategies can be coordinated with the developmental learning needs of student teachers ( see table 2 ) . 11 <p> At first glance , these learning goals , mentoring roles , and mentoring strategies seem commonplace , not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these roles and goals are to be integral to the student-teacher learning process , however , specific social and organizational structures that support teacher growth and development must be built . The primary social structure required is a laboratory view of practical experience that emphasizes inquiry-based working strategies and reflection opportunities , in contrast to apprenticeship training . The goal is to create a social learning structure whereby student teachers , cooperating teachers , and university personnel collectively share in the creation of common goals , mutually generate learning problems , and willingly desire to learn from each other . We see such a group of teaching professionals as a community of learners . A necessary yet often-missing supportive structure for creating a community of learners is an ongoing , shared learning agenda divided equally between school and university - one in which there is a true partnership of equity and responsibility . <p> The link between professional growth and student-teacher learning also depends on the way the roles of cooperating teachers , university professors , and student teachers are defined . Rather than modeling specific teaching techniques or directing student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be responsible for articulating inquiry-based questions . In addition , cooperating teachers should support student teachers ' own inquiry by sharing the frameworks they use for understanding teaching . In their role as supervisors , university faculty should function primarily as co-learners , rather than simply evaluators or knowledge brokers . Sharing resources , facilitating joint meetings , and analyzing teaching practices are some of the main ways they can share in creating a collaborative environment . <p> Rather than simply imitating instructional styles , student teachers should construct their own knowledge , question relationships between theory and practice , write about and discuss their experiences , and develop inquiry-driven projects for investigating their own and others ' teaching practice. 12 To achieve these goals , the following learning process can be used in mentoring student teachers ' development . <p> Learning-memo ring process . Beginning student teaching involves observation by the novice teacher along with some collaborative teaching . This progresses to a supervised situation where mentors provide feed-back and help the student teacher reflect on actions . Then the student teacher focuses on the students he or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsive learning experiences - and the mentor provides critical feedback in a positive , supportive , and question-based manner . <p> Cooperating teachers can empower student teachers to think and act as learners by using various investigative strategies . Rather than giving primarily corrective feedback to the student teacher following a lesson , the cooperating teacher can ask questions that encourage student teachers to analyze a rehearsal or class . Patti Krueger , for example , encourages self-analysis through questions that require the novice teacher to reflect , speculate , transfer , project , and research ( call upon his or her knowledge base of teaching ) . 13 <p> For autonomous student teaching to occur , cooperating teachers must introduce inquiry skills early in the teaching-learning process and create multiple ongoing opportunities for developing habits of critical thought . Critical discussions , descriptions of learners ' work , analysis of classroom interactions , case-study generation , and reflective journals are a few of the strategies that will help student teachers become close observers and participants in the inquiry process . If the profession desires curious , confident , knowledgeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own professional growth , then we must create a learning atmosphere that values questioning and collaboration . <p> A central understanding that collaboration is key to the learning process is necessary if student teachers are to refine their teaching role orientation and move from knowing about teaching to knowing how to teach , and ultimately knowing why they teach . This is especially important for connecting preservice-teacher learning to inquiry in the highly contextualized situations that classrooms provide . For cooperating teachers , mentoring from a constructivist-based theory of professional development requires knowledge of this process and sensitivity to theoretical bases from which professional growth emanates . A Collaborative Model <p> As teacher-educators , we continually strive to improve our profession by attending and presenting at conferences , engaging in scholarly reading , questioning the status quo , and mentoring young teachers . The preservice or novice teacher collaborates with college professors and practicing teachers , as well as developing the network of colleagues and administrators who continue to mentor the new teacher throughout his or her career . <p> The traditional model of music teacher education , built on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novice , no longer seems particularly desirable , nor even defensible . A more appropriate model would champion collaboration and see the novice as an interpreter and colearner . In discussing music teacher education as a transformative experience , Eunice <p> Boardman Meske uses the metaphor of the preservice teacher in metamorphosis , as an emerging butterfly. 14 For a true transformation to occur , preservice teachers must be nurtured in an environment that encourages questioning , acknowledges their developmental phases , and helps them construct their own knowledge of teaching and learning based on continuous inquiry . <p> A culture of mentoring must begin with today 's music educators questioning long-held and unexamined practices , policies , and traditions . We must be willing to step out of the safety of what has worked in the past . If real educational reform is to occur , it will come from teachers collaborating at all points . William Ayers , in To Teach : The Journey of a Teacher , aptly states why we teach and why we mentor : " Teaching is an act of hope for the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the key strategy involved . " <p>
