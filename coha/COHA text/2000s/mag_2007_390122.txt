Headnote Every year , nearly 2.5 million people go under the knife unnecessarily , often with devastating consequences . Make sure you 're not one of them TWO YEARS AGO , when Leah Coppersmith went in for back surgery , she expected to be lacing up her running shoes within days . She 's been in pain ever since . A car accident in 1991 left this mother of four with nagging lower-back painannoying , but not bad enough to keep her from running 5-Ks . But in 2005 , the nag grew to a scream . An MRI revealed that two disks- the gel-filled cushions between the vertebrae-were badly worn . Coppersmith expected the doctor to recommend a diskectomy , in which part of a troublesome disk is removed to relieve pressure on the nerve ; the low-risk surgery had helped her once before . But this time , the surgeon wanted to replace a disk with an artificial one . The procedure was getting great results , he said . Coppersmith was skeptical until he told her she 'd be back running 5-Ks again in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now the defining feature of her life . She ca n't sit down to family dinners . She quit her job because she ca n't work at a desk . Her misery has company : While looking for help online , she found a study showing that 64% of people who received the disk , called the Charit , still needed narcotic painkillers 2 years after surgery . Every year , upward of 15 million Americans go under the knife- and for most of them , surgery provides relief or a new lease on life . Joints are replaced , organs are transplanted , lives are saved . But Congress has estimated that surgeons perform 2.4 million unnecessary surgeries a year in the United States , with a cost of roughly $3.9 billion-and a toll of about 11,900 deaths . The reason is n't simple . " The majority of surgeons who per- form these procedures are actually very enthusiastic about their benefits , " says Mark Chassin , MD , chair of the depart- ment of health policy at Mount Sinai School of Medicine . " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves , How many unnecessary proce- dures cnido today ? But there 's a lot of financial incentive to do surgery that may not benefit the patient , and very little oversight . " ( See " Why Is Unneces- sary Surgery So Common ? " at right . ) So how do you know when someone is suggesting surgery you do n't need- and what can you do to prevent it ? Your first line of defense is to become your own advocate . One study showed that when patients and doctors share the deci- sion making , rates of surgery drop by as much as 44% . Here , we explain what 's behind four of the procedures most often done unnecessarily and give you expert advice on the best alternatives . BE SKEPTICAL : SPINAL SURGERY THE WAITING ROOM of Charles Rosen , MD , a spinal surgeon and an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of California , Irvine , was filled with patients who , like Copper- smith , had failed disk implants . " In my 20 years of orthopedics , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constant pain , " he says . So Rosen exam- ined the evidence backing the Charit disk . He was shocked to see that the researchers had compared patients who got the disk with those who received a type of fusion surgery with a particularly high failure rate- 60% . ( Even before the study 's publication , that procedure had been largely abandoned . ) Then he discovered that researchers on other Charit studies were paid consultants for the device maker . Outraged , Rosen founded the Association of Ethical Spine Surgeons . Members agree not to take money from device makers or form partnerships with the companies . The spine is ground zero for unnecessary surgeries partly because back pain is incredibly common and notoriously tough to treat . More than 1 million sufferers opt for surgery each year , and spinal fusion- the use of bone grafts , screws , and other devices to secure one or more vertebrae- is one of the most popular choices . Between 1996 and 2001 , the number of spinal fusions skyrocketed 113% , while the number of knee- and hip-replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike those procedures , spinal surgeries often fail- instead of relieving pain , they can turn it into agony . According to Aaron Filler , MD , PhD , director of the Peripheral Nerve Surgery Program , Institute for Spinal Disorders , at CedarsSinai Medical Center in Los Angeles , there are tremendous rewards for spinal surgeons who do aggressive procedures : Because of the hardware involved , an operation on the spine can pay a surgeon 10 times as much as one on the brain . Yet the money-making back surgeries help in only a small proportion of cases . What 's more , back surgeons are rarely held accountable if the operation fails . " The referring doctor has low expectations , " Filler says . " So does the patient , because everyone thinks of back problems as so difficult to treat . " Protect Yourself Pinpoint the pain If your doctor labels your back pain as " nonspecific , " it means he does n't know the cause ; if he suggests surgery , alarm bells should go off , says Filler . Spinal fusion is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones below , which is easily detected on an x-ray . " When properly done for the right reasons , spinal surgery can be extremely effective , " says Filler . Make lifestyle adjustments A 2003 study compared spinal fusion surgery with a lifestyle approach to back pain : Docs taught patients how to protect their backs , by bending at the knees when lifting , for instance . They also encouraged exercise , like water aerobics . A year later , the nonsurgical approach reduced pain and increased mobility just as much as surgery did . Alternative treatments such as chiropractic and acupuncture can also pay off , studies show . For more info on finding alternative treatments , go to prevention.com/links . Considera helpful shot A nerve-blocking injection called an epidural , given by a surgeon or a rehab specialist like a physiatrist , may quiet the pain for up to a year ; it helps in about 50% of patients . Skip the hardware If surgery seems like the right approach , get the simplest procedure possible . There 's a much smaller chance of complications if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have an artificial disk implanted . BE SKEPTICAL : HYSTERECTOMY LORI JO VEST was 36 when three doctors told her a hysterectomy was the only fix for her heavy bleeding caused by uterine fibroids . Terrified that she 'd be thrust into early menopause- in half of all hysterectomies , surgeons end up removing the ovaries , too- Vest went online and discovered myomectomy , in which the surgeon cuts out the fibroids , sparing the uterus . But her doctors nixed the idea ; after all , they said , Vest , who had a toddler , did n't want more children . Then Vest called the nearby University of Michigan , Ann Arbor- and nearly leaped through the phone when she heard they had a clinic for women seeking alternatives to hysterectomy . " The doctor said I was a perfect candidate for myomectomy , " Vest says . She also told Vest that many surgeons dislike the surgery because it 's more difficult than a hysterectomy . Now 44 , Vest no longer is troubled by heavy bleeding , but she still has her uterus and ovaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until my body is ready , " she says . Hysterectomy is second only to C-section as the most common surgery performed on women in the United States . Each year more than 600,000 Americans have the procedure- twice the rate as in England . A 2000 study found that 70% of the hysterectomies performed in nine Southern California managedcare organizations were recommended inappropriately . " The most common mistake we saw was that doctors did n't try safer , less-invasive approaches first , " says lead author Michael Broder , MD , an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA 's David Geffen School of Medicine . Hysterectomy can be warranted if a woman has cancer , and it can be the right choice in other cases , too-for instance , if medical treatment did n't get your bleeding under adequate control , and you do n't want to try a surgery like myomectomy because of the risk of recurrence . But unless you have cancer , " having a doctor say , " You absolutely need a hysterectomy , ' is akin to a waiter at a restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' " says Malcolm G. Munro , MD , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA . " A good doctor should give you a menu of choices . " Protect Yourself Try hormones or drugs first Most hysterectomies are done on women under age 45 , but if you can manage symptoms of fibroids with medication until menopause , symptoms usually ease naturally . Birth control pills or other drugs help control irregular bleeding . Also check into getting a progestin-releasing IUD ( Mirena ) : It can dramatically decrease bleeding caused by fibroids . Consider a less drastic procedure Like myomectomy , uterine fibroid embolization ( UFE ) preserves the uterus : An " interventional " radiologist carefully closes off blood vessels feeding the fibroids , starving them . A woman may need more treatment after either procedure if the fibroids come back , and both cause a fair amount of discomfort . ( UFE can require serious pain meds , although recovery is quicker than after a hysterectomy , and the risks are lower . ) For more info on hysterectomy alternatives , go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forensic engineer in Boynton Beach , FL , felt a stabbing chest pain at age 45 , he went straight to the cardiologist . The diagnosis ? A narrowed artery . The answer ? Angioplasty . But Melnicoff was scared of surgery ; even when the doctor told him he 'd die without the artery-opening procedure , he chose drug therapy instead . ( He also chose a new doctor . ) That was 25 years ago . With the help of daily heart medications , his chest pain vanished . He walks , 30 minutes a day , 7 days a week , and feels great . He made the right choice . Though angioplasty has been hailed by some as a wonder fix for decades , it now turns out that most of the time , the procedure does n't help . Angioplasty can save your life if it 's done during or right after a heart attack . But in other circumstances , it may not do you much good . " Doctors used to think of heart disease as a plumbing problem-that arteries were like drainpipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Arthur Agatston , MD , a preventive cardiologist and author of The South Beach Heart Program . So it seemed to make sense to use angioplasty , in which a small balloon is inflated in the artery , to get that gunk out of the way by squashing it against the vessel wall . However , research has since shown that problematic plaque actually forms within the delicate inner lining of artery walls . What does cause a heart attack ? If the plaque within the wall ruptures , it injures the artery , producing a blood clot as part of the healing process . Unfortunately , the clot can close off the entire artery-that 's a heart attack , and you need angioplasty or bypass surgery immediately . If you have angioplasty , the doctor may also insert a stent , a mesh scaffolding , to hold open the artery . But if you 're not having a heart attack , angioplasty ( with or without a stent ) wo n't help and may even do some harm . That 's the news from a large trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People with " stable " heart disease-they were n't having a heart attack , but a vessel was at least 70% closed-fared no worse if they received medical therapy , such as aspirin , blood thinners , and cholesterol-lowering drugs , than if they got angioplasty . During the next 4 years , neither group was more likely to have a heart attack or stroke or die . A study published late last year helps pinpoint exactly when it 's worth getting angioplasty . That trial showed that if the procedure was done 3 or more days after a heart attack , it did n't help . " We were very surprised-we thought angioplasty would be beneficial even if it was done later , " says lead author Judith Hochman , MD , director of the cardiovascular clinical research center at New York University School of Medicine . " But that 's why we do studies : to see if the patient really does benefit . " Protect Yourself Insist on being convinced If your doctor says you need a nonemergency angioplasty , ask if it will prolong your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Agatston . If the procedure is n't needed to save your life , it still may make sense if angina ( bouts of chest discomfort caused by a lack of blood flow to the heart ) interferes with daily activities . But get a second opinion-from a preventive cardiologist , not a cardiac surgeon . Eat right , exercise , and lose weight if necesary You need n't avoid fats and carbs to keep your heart healthy-just choose wisely . A diet high in omega-3-rich canola and olive oils can actually protect your heart . High-fiber carbs in whole grains , fruits , and veggies also help get fats out of your blood . Use the meds known to save lives Many people with high cholesterol are n't on statins , though the drugs slash the risk of heart attack by more than 30% . Similarly , most people with high blood pressure do n't get adequate treatment , studies show . Lifestyle changes can bring down both cholesterol and BP , but if they 're not enough , medication can be lifesaving . Your doctor may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of a blood clot . BE SKEPTICAL : KNEE ARTHROSCOPY SOON AFTER Diana Aceti turned 50 , the ache in her knee began to keep her from walking and playing tennis , two activities she loved . An orthopedist said that she had a small tear in her cartilage and recommended arthroscopic surgery . " He said I 'd back on my feet in a few weeks , " says the public relations director from Bridgehampton , NY . But afterward , Aceti 's knee hurt worse than ever . So she got a second opinion-and the news was n't good . In a rare complication , her cartilage was damaged beyond repair , and she needed a partial knee replacement . " Doctors talk about surgery like it 's getting your teeth cleaned , " says Aceti . " If he 'd told me this was a possibility , I never would have done it . " Knee arthroscopy is most often used for people , like Aceti , who have osteoarthritiscartilage damaged by wear and tear . A surgeon makes small incisions and inserts instruments to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reducing pain . Yet in 2002 , when knee arthroscopy was put to the test in a randomized , controlled trial , it failed royally . Osteoarthritis patients given arthroscopy reported no more improvement than those who got sham surgery-incisions were made but no arthroscope was inserted . Still , 5 years later , the procedure remains among the top 10 outpatient surgeries : More than 650,000 knee arthroscopies are performed annually . Critics say that almost everyone has small tears in their knee cartilage visible on MRIs , providing a never-fail excuse for surgery . " Patients have arthroscopy for what is clearly the result of a bruise or a bump , " says Ronald Grelsamer , MD , an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City . " For many orthopedists it 's the only way left to make a half-decent living . Does that justify it ? No . " The procedure can help in certain situations , Grelsamer says : If a piece of cartilage is catching , like a hangnail , clipping it can make you feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients , flushing the interior of the knee during arthroscopy can ease pain , perhaps by getting rid of irritating chemicals . Researchers ca n't predict who will benefit from a wash-out , though-and surgeon Bruce J. Moseley , MD , who led the sham surgery comparison , argues that any improvement in arthritis patients is due to the placebo effect . Protect Yourself Wait a while Arthroscopy is most frequently done after a twist or fall , but those injuries often get better within a few months with physical therapy , anti-inflammatory meds , a cortisone injection-or just the passage of time . Be skeptical of MRI results Arthroscopy is most apt to help if there 's a detached fragment of cartilage or a severe tear-a 3 on a 1-to-3 scale , as rated by a radiologist . But even a bad tear may not cause pain , so ask whether it matches up with the area that hurts . Sidebar Why Is Unnecessary Surgery So Common ? To make certain you do n't go under the knife without good cause , it helps to understand the root of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always making small changes , trying to improve outcomes- but as with knee surgery ( p. 200 ) and angioplasty ( p. 170 ) , sometimes it takes years for research to disclose flaws . Do n't wait for new thinking to trickle down into your doctor 's office- do research , and ask tough questions . 2 . Docs ' shrinking salaries Since 1992 , Medicare and insurance companies have become increasingly tightfisted in setting reimbursement rates for surgery . A total knee replacement , for example , paid an average $2,301 in 1989 and $1,314 in 2007 . The result : Surgeons ' incomes dropped 8.2% between 1995 and 2003 . Even well-meaning doctors are looking for ways to fill the gap . 3 . Lure of easy money One way to make up the shortfall : partnering with medical device makers . This practice is most common in fields like orthopedic surgery , because it 's not uncommon for a single spinal surgery to require hardware costing $50,000 , says spine expert Aaron Filler , MD , PhD . Some surgeons form a distributorship with a device company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for billing : The more devices the surgeon uses , the more money he or she makes . Others sign on as high-paid consultants , encouraging fellow surgeons to use a particular maker 's device . " You ca n't do that and be unbiased , " says spinal surgeon Charles Rosen , MD. 3 Moves You Must Make Before Any Surgery 1 . Get a second opinion-and a third if you 're still unsure Go beyond the first surgeon 's orbit for an independent judgment : If he 's at your community hospital , head to a university-linked teaching institution , or find a doc in the next town . Ask your primary-care doc if she can suggest one . 2 . Read a few good books Look for those written by university-based experts : It 's a quick way to bone up on the issues , in a format with plenty of room for nuance . 3 . Surf with caution Why bother with books ? Because chat groups and other Internet sources can be biased in ways that are hard for prospective patients to recognize . Charles Rosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surgeons , recalls posting a warning about a spinal implant on a discussion group sponsored by a device manufacturer-by the next day , he says , his comment had been removed . <p>
