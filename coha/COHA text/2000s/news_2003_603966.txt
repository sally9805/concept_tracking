<p> NASHVILLE  --  There was no traditional handshake at midfield between head coaches after Saturday 's AFC divisional playoff ended in overtime with the Tennessee Titans ' Joe Nedney booting a 26-yard field goal . <p> Instead of seeking to congratulate his counterpart , piping-hot Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher sprinted to chase down referee Ron Blum . <p> It was Cowher 's last-gasp effort to avoid the inevitable  --  a 34-31 loss that ended the Steelers ' season . And it was the last image the NFL wanted projected after a controversial ending six days earlier in San Francisco might have cost the New York Giants a playoff victory against the 49ers . <p> Instead , there was no respite for the NFL 's officiating department after publicly apologizing to the Giants for failing to call a penalty during an aborted field goal try in the final seconds of San Francisco 's win in an NFC wild-card game . <p> " Fine me if you want , " Cowher said in a lashing of the officials after the game . " I 'm not going to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win , and we did n't . But we had something taken away from us today , too . " <p> Pittsburgh , which rallied from a 14-point first-quarter deficit , squandered a chance to take the lead in the final three minutes of regulation . But the Steelers left the Coliseum feeling robbed after Dewayne Washington was flagged for running into the kicker on Nedney 's first attempt at a winning kick in overtime  --  the one that hooked wide right from 31 yards out . <p> As Nedney lined up for the ensuing try , 5 yards closer after the penalty , Steelers linebacker Jason Gildon was rebuffed in his obvious attempts to call a timeout to try freezing the kicker . The official closest to Gildon , umpire Chad Brown , ignored the linebacker 's plea . <p> " It 's pathetic , " Gildon said . " How do you explain something like that ? I think it 's another example of officials not being on top of their game . I mean , it 's the playoffs . There 's a lot at stake . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The players are going to show up and play , but at the same time ( the officials must ) be held up to a standard . " <p> But Mike Pereira , the NFL 's director of officiating , said the league reviewed the game and stands by the officiating decisions . The other games this weekend went off hitch-free . <p> The call on Washington and the non-call for a timeout might not have been as egregious as the failure to flag the 49ers for pass interference last week , when the officiating crew did n't identify guard Rich Seubert as checking in as an eligible receiver . <p> That gaffe cost the Giants the chance for a repeat field-goal try that could have won the game . <p> But the Steelers ' final hope Saturday was the common ploy of trying to freeze the kicker by calling a timeout , and anybody in the stadium could have seen Gildon frantically motioning to the umpire before the snap . <p> " I called him by his first name , " Gildon said . " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me we did n't have any timeouts . Then I pointed at the scoreboard . We had two left . " <p> Defensive end Kimo von Oelhoffen said , " We all called timeout . I do n't know if they are senile or what . That was overtime . We got three more timeouts . " <p> Blum maintained in an interview with a pool reporter that Gildon 's request was late . <p> " I was n't aware that they were " trying to call a timeout , Blum said , " but one of my co-officials said that the request came after the ball was snapped . " <p> Said Pereira : " I have not been able to study that . " <p> A game of second-guessing <p> The sequence capped a **25;604;TOOLONG 3-hour , 50-minute game filled with questionable calls or non-calls that affected both teams . <p> * The Titans lost running back Eddie George to a concussion on the first snap of the second half when Steelers nose tackle Casey Hampton flattened him with an illegal helmet-to-helmet blow that did not draw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ball , the play was n't whistled dead . Instead , Steelers defensive end Aaron Smith snatched the football . One play after the recovery , Amos Zereoue powered his way to a 31-yard touchdown that gave Pittsburgh a 20-14 lead . <p> * In the fourth quarter , Titans safety Lance Schulters was flagged for a blow to the head on Steelers receiver Hines Ward after an 18-yard catch  --  the type of penalty that went uncalled on Hampton 's hit . <p> Replays , however , showed that Schulters led with his shoulder pads and not the helmet . Ward figured the flag was thrown because he was in a defenseless position , but he admitted it might have been unwarranted . <p> The penalty added 15 yards to a drive that ended with a 40-yard field goal , giving Pittsburgh a 31-28 lead . Said Ward : " He made a hit , and I got up from it . The extra yards helped us . But who am I to tell the officials , ' Do n't call it . ' " <p> * Nedney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Replays confirm Washington made contact with Nedney after he finished his follow-through on the 31-yard missed field goal and was n't blocked into the kicker . But part of Pittsburgh 's beef was that the officials threw the flag only after watching the Steelers celebrate the miss . <p> Cowher 's contention that Nedney took " two steps " into Washington was not evident on the replay . Yet Nedney implied he might have influenced the call by flopping upon contact . <p> " He got a pretty good hit on me , " Nedney said of Washington . " But when I 'm done playing , I might try acting . " <p> * The most clear-cut case against the officials , though , came late in the third quarter , when Titans standout Derrick Mason returned a punt 30 yards to the Steelers ' 30-yard line . <p> At the start of the return , Mason was brushed by cover man Chris Hope and slipped off-balance . Cowher , believing Mason was down , immediately challenged the play . But Blum told him the play was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mike , admitted to the crowd of 68,808 and to the millions watching on TV that he was n't sure if the play was eligible for review . Such an admission during such a big game , particularly after NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue demanded that officiating crews huddle to hash out controversial issues , was a blow to the crew 's credibility . <p> " He told me it was n't a reviewable call , " Cowher said of Blum . " The one thing at least he did do well was call up to the booth to find out if it was a reviewable call . Thank goodness somebody in the stadium knew the rules . " <p> Titans coach Jeff Fisher , co-chairman of the NFL Competition Committee , said the confusion might have stemmed from Cowher wanting the play reviewed to prove that Mason was down by contact . When a player is ruled down by contact , it 's not a reviewable play . As Mason was not ruled down , the play was reviewable . <p> After the review , the call on the field was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All I care about is getting the call right . It may not have looked the way we wanted it to with the explanation , but in the end , he got it right , " Pereira said . <p> Because of a penalty , the play was redone . <p> " He 's the head ref . He 's got a white hat on . He does n't know the rule on a simple play like that ? " Steelers linebacker Joey Porter said of Blum . <p> " Take nothing away from Tennessee . They played hard . . . . ( But ) I ca n't believe the refs are put in a position to take the game away . <p> " It 's as simple as that : They took the game away from us . " <p> To the victor go the spoils <p> The Titans had multiple beefs , too , including on a call for unnecessary roughness late in the game on defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth for body-slamming Zereoue . Fisher said Haynesworth continued on the play because no whistle was blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content with an outcome that has his team in the AFC title game . <p> " This game was physical , " Fisher said . " It was a wild ballgame , and there are going to be some ( close ) calls in games like this . I have great respect for Ron Blum and everyone else who was out there . As coaches , sometimes we are going to disagree with some things . This is a playoff-caliber crew , and I ca n't complain . " <p> That was hardly the sentiment in the Steelers ' locker room . <p> " It gets frustrating with these bad calls , " Ward said . " You just hate these crucial calls in the playoffs . I 'm sure the Giants are pretty sick right now . The problem has to be resolved . " <p> Are the Steelers next in line for an apology from the NFL , a la the Giants ? <p> " What can an apology do for me right now ? " Porter said . " It does nothing . We are still going home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . I ca n't go to work on Monday . " <p> What can be reviewed <p> * Reviewable plays include those governed by a sideline , goal line , end zone or end line , as in a player breaking the plane of the goal line for a TD . Replay also can help determine if a pass was complete or intercepted , if a pass was touched by an ineligible receiver , if the ball was illegally passed beyond the line of scrimmage , if the passer fumbled while throwing , if there was a lateral , if forward progress gave a team a first down , who touched a kick and how many players were on the field . <p> * What 's not reviewable includes clock status , proper down , penalty administration , runner ruled down by contact , forward progress not related to a first down or the goal line , force out , field goals and pass interference .
