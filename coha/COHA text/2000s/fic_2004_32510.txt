The summer of 1931 was a season of dying trees . Had we talked to any of the farmers who lived nearby , we would 've understood that his blight was n't a curse or an omen , simply the habit of a beetle and the fungus it carried . But in the particular stand of woods where we lived there was no talk of Dutch elm disease , nor any of the other plagues that preyed on bark and leaves . Instead , we took the dying trees as a personal insult , an emblem of our lives : the house in Cleveland deserted , Father out of work , and Mother going blind . The trees became a permanent feature of our landscape ; stark , implacable teachers instructing us in broken dreams , admonishing us , despite the promise of better times , that most of what we hoped for in life was impossible , that to believe otherwise was impractical , even dangerous . Most things that die wither away or we put them underground , but trees stay standing , rows of barren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snow finally brings them down . Trees return slowly to the earth , and so the stubborn shadows of their dissolution darkened our childhood games . Everyone we knew told us not to climb in dying trees , but Phil went up anyway , ignoring the brittle limbs , cursing when a tree refused to hold his weight . Defiance was his will . When Miss Dossin told him to stay in out of the rain at recess , he went out without his slicker . When Mother complained that too much reading was clouding her eyesight , he gathered all her books and burned them . When we lived in Cleveland , he raised rabbits , and when a rabbit got sick and died , he kept the carcass in our room until Father forced him to bury it . In those days mybrother broke rules and crossed boundaries . He gave no ground . He pushed against everything , even death . We heard the story over and over again , first from Lethea , the midwife , and then from my mother , until every detail became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother and his twin sister were conceived under a full moon . " Men spring from the sun , " she said , " and women from the earth . But the gift of twins , when twins are man and woman , comes from the moon , because the moon partakes of both the sun and the earth . " My mother could n't remember if she conceived her first two children beneath a full moon , but she said that Lethea possessed a time-tested wisdom , and that we 'd do well to listen to anything she had to say . What my mother remembered was that the month of June in 1915 was unseasonably hot ; scant afternoon showers provided nothing more than an evening steam bath , and her twin-filled belly felt overripe , ready to burst . " Twins mean good luck , " said Lethea . " Twice the light for a dark world . " But my mother knew that something was wrong . The days of kicking and turning had just begun when , in a rare moment of peace , she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fluttered and she experienced a sudden shortness of breath . Nothing more had occurred , but when the labor pains began , she felt it again , something hard turning inside her . Lethea arrived at dusk . The contractions came at regular intervals but the twins were stubborn . " Unwilling , " said Lethea . " Ornery and unwilling . " She put a thin piece of wood between my mother 's teeth , but took it away when it cracked and splintered , drawing blood . Lethea talked and prayed and rubbed my mother 's legs and feet . My mother screamed and wept and pushed . And then my brother dropped his head and shoulders into Lethea 's waiting hands , and when Lethea cut him free , he wailed to tell the world of something he had seen . And then came my sister with less struggle , smaller , the umbilical cord around her neck . Lethea covered the child with a towel , but my mother felt the truth , she felt it when the stone dropped inside her , and now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born of tragedy , " Mother said . " At the moment of his awakening , he lost his second self . " I was born eighteen months later , without struggle or tragedy , on a winter night noteworthy only for its calm . I was the second surviving child of what would soon be four children . My sister Margie followed me , and then Myron . We lived in a rented house on a street named Joy , and my first memories go back to the room I shared with Phil and his pets . He kept turtles , frogs , fish , butterflies , grasshoppers , mice , and rabbits . I liked the rabbits because they were fast and mischievous , jumping off the twin beds and hiding behind the closet door . Phil looked after his rabbits like a missionary after his flock ; he tended the sick , cleaned cages , and provided fresh food with an evangelical fervor . Some of the rabbits were sold as house pets to families uptown . Others ran away or we gave them away . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but during hot summer months they moved under the back porch where the ground was cool and the latticework kept them safe . Being younger , I failed to understand the full measure of Phil 's devotion . My mind could n't grasp the fierceness of his loyalty . I did n't even know that it was blood when Phil ran crying into the house , hands and face smeared , shirt and trousers stained . I thought it was berry juice . Or maybe the red across his forehead was rage . That would explain his tearing into Father 's closet and taking the rifle that we were told never to touch . I followed him outside and we crawled under the back porch . It was mossy and dark , but I could see the broken lattice and a pile of bloody fur , and then another , larger this time , and then more piles , some with something half-chewed still moving . Phil crawled from pile to pile , cursing loud enough for the neighbors to hear , laying his hand on whatever remained until he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me help him . He would not let me touch anything living or dead . When we came back into the sunlight , we did n't speak . Phil sat down next to the broken lattice , the rifle on his lap . When Mother and Father came home , I told them what had happened . Father went out the back door with a resolute expression on his face , but he came back into the house without his rifle . Phil refused his dinner that night . He refused to sleep . He stayed out all night waiting for whatever it was that had done the killing . He waited three nights , but it never came back . " It killed ' em for fun , " he said . Then he sold the cages , burned five or six bags of wood shavings , and handed Mother the eyedropper and water bottles . By October , he gave away or set free every creature in our bedroom . I pleaded for the frogs and whined about the turtles for almost a week . " Forget it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " The winter months were slow with only people in the house , and Mother noticed the change . " It feels empty , " she said . " Less trouble , I suppose , but empty . " My mother was an expert seamstress commissioned by uptown families to hem curtains or embroider tablecloths . That winter , though , the demand for her skills dwindled until in February her one order was a christening blanket for a neighbor down the street . In that same month my father brought home less money . " Customers wo n't come out , " he said . " Streets are bad . All the ruts are frozen . " We hoped that spring would bring opportunities for work , and when the snow finally melted , Phil and I made the usual rounds , looking to rake winter-killed grass from the big lawns , but we found no employers . And then the unimaginable happened . Fred 's Radio &; Repair , the shop where my father worked , shut its doors . Father made the announcement at dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught off guard . " But you told us , " said Phil , " that everyone needs the shop and always will . " Father made no reply . He looked at Mother , and then at the floor . Fred 's Radio &; Repair was the cornerstone of our world ; its collapse suggested that the strongest foundations were vulnerable . What followed was the first of several visits from the man my father referred to only as the landlord . Mother sold everything of value , including the silver candlesticks that came as a wedding gift from Grandmother . She sold our console radio . My father refused to leave the house for several days ; he moved silently from room to room , his face pale and helpless , as if he were a condemned man . Then , after a blur of packing and hasty farewells , Cleveland became the place my family hailed from , a memory of better days that we cherished and embellished over time . We moved into a large tent on a half-acre lot that Father bought for twenty-five dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Mayfield . We had to clear trees and build an outhouse , live without electricity and running water , but the property bordered a meadow , and it sat on the high side of the Chagrin River . Mayfield was the first great adventure of my life , exploring the woods with Phil , running barefoot across the meadow that dropped down to the river . On the border between the meadow and woods stood a line of scruffy bushes heavy with giant blackberries . Our fingers turned dark red , then purple , picking the sticky fruit . The abundance was overwhelming . We ate while we picked , until stomach cramps made us stop . Phil and I would stay well away from the tent , keeping it out of sight , returning only when wind drove the rain in our faces or when mosquitoes rose up from the river at dusk . I did n't think about Mother and Father , their struggles or fears . I left them alone to take care of Margie and Myron . I gave them time to plan the family 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery and wonder of the woods , did n't anticipate the coming seasons , the shorter days , and the inescapable dangers of living without money . Phil knew something about these things , and depending on his mood , he sheltered me or taught me , tried to explain that the world was both arbitrary and just , a contradiction that to his mind made perfect sense . We made up all sorts of outdoor games , and our unrivaled favorite was the weekly ambush of the bakery wagon . We sat next to the dirt road and listened for the first echoes of the trotting horse . " Jesus , if we only had a nickel , " said Phil . " You say that every time . " His eyebrows came together . We crouched in the tall grass as the horse and driver rolled by , and then we bolted into the road , running behind the wagon to get the delicious smells . The air danced and swirled , wrapping us in eddies of fresh bread , butter , cinnamon , raisins , and doughnuts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got closer to the wagon . I imagined myself a bandit then , plundering the wagon 's payload of ruby red jelly and golden cakes . Phil and I ran until we were out of breath . " Next week , " I said . " Let 's bring Myron . " " He 's not fast enough , " said Phil . " I could pull ' im . " " You 'd bite the dust . You 'd break your arm and he 'd break a tooth . Then I 'd be stuck carrying both of you back to the tent . " " You always spoil stuff . " " I do not . " " You do ! You always spoil my fun . You never do anything I wan na do . " " That 's not true , " said Phil , cracking his knuckles . " We went swimming yesterday . " " It does n't matter . Most of the time we do what you want . " " That 's because I 'm older . " " Yeah , I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not stupid , " said Phil . " It 's just that some of your ideas are stupid . " " Why ? " " Because half the time you miss what 's right in front of your face . " " I see plenty . " " You see those trees ? " " Which ones ? " Phil pointed . " That stretch we walked through to get here . " " What about ' em ? " " They 're all dying . Some of ' em are dead . " " They are not . " " For Christ 's sake . Look ! Ca n't you see the green turning yellow ? Some of ' em are standing without half their leaves ! Who ever heard of leaves going yellow  --  or leaves falling by the bushel  --  this time of year ? " " Maybe those cold nights we had  --  " " It has n't been that cold . " " Well , maybe they 're just old . " " Some of those trees are n't much taller than you or me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever it is does n't make a sound . It 's not like at night when you wake up and hear things  --  like a ticking or a rustling , sometimes a snarl . Something quiet is after those trees . " When we were kids , my brother talked to me , the edge in his voice already sharp , and he frequently described a world that I did not want to accept . At the same time , his ability to see what others overlooked bound me to him . It gave him a strange power over the people he loved , and it gave me the wisdom to know that any story involving me was really my brother 's story . Phil was the first to see those dying trees , and the truth of their dying loomed larger the longer my family lived on that half-acre lot . He was the first to see that Father was an affable fool , that we would be lucky to escape the army surplus tent that Mother called our temporary home . And he was the first to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over men and boys . At church socials in Cleveland her dance card was the first one filled , and I remember her laughter , her blushing face , and the lush folds of her skirt swirling as she danced with Father , his friends , and sometimes Phil or me . Her body was lean and muscular , almost masculine , but still voluptuous in its movements and generosity . Every action conveyed confidence , what my father called good , old-fashioned , Midwestern self-reliance . There was a purity about her , a promise that her body and soul were safe haven , a place of healing , a sanctuary where sons and lovers could drop their defenses and perhaps show themselves to be something more than men . Maybe it was the long hair that she wore well past middle age . Maybe it was the way she turned her head , the way she curved her slim hand toward her breast or drew her legs up , sitting by the fire , and let her bronze hair stream about her knees . Maybe it was the grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a poetic passion ; she stirred a tenderness in them that living forced them to forget . Phil was my mother 's first child , and he laid claim to the largest part of her heart . Not even Margie , with her piercing blue eyes and a limitless capacity for unqualified love , could displace my brother 's privilege . I thought for a long time that my stillborn sister formed the bond between Phil and my mother ; but I began to see that of all the children , Phil was the least like my father , and this was the wellspring of my mother 's affection . She adored Phil 's stubbornness and determination , and so she held him closer , doted on him , tried to temper his strength with a love for kindness and beauty . My mother adored flowers , pressing roses and lilies and fleabane and sow thistle between sheets of soft ivory paper . She sewed the sheets together , using thick cardboard for covers , and when we packed the house in Cleveland , she gave the book to Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Margie . " She ca n't see the flowers anymore , " said Phil . " Sure she can , " I said . " She told me , " said Phil , " that the littlest ones go fuzzy around the edges . " " Will you let me look at the book sometimes ? " asked Margie . " Sure , " said Phil . And he did . Anytime Margie wanted to see the book Phil sat down with her and turned the heavy pages , trying to name the different flowers that Mother knew so well . We all found wildflowers when we lived in the woods , and we gave them to Phil and he sorted and pressed them . One afternoon Mother tried to see what we had found , squinting through her thick glasses , until Phil closed the book in frustration . " Do n't you dare think of it , " she said then , her face sharp with disapproval . Phil handed me the book , and my mother 's words took me back to a day in Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , a day filled with waiting for my mother , waiting for the news she would bring from the doctor who forced bright beams of light into her brown eyes , who made her read a strange and shrinking alphabet on distant charts . She came home at dusk saying that the doctor discovered what was wrong . " It 's eye strain , " she lied . " Your mother is just tired . The doctor says that if I do less reading it 'll probably clear up . " Phil took her at her word and ran through the house picking up her books and magazines . Her reading material amounted to a large box of old novels , copies of The Saturday Evening Post , and a few yellowed newspapers , and when Phil came running down the steps , he tripped , tumbling in a waterfall of white pages to the foot of the stairs . Father slammed the refrigerator . " What in God 's name is that boy up to ? " " Philip , " said Mother . " Come here this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents of the box . " Philip , those are my things . Put them back where you found them . " Phil kicked open the front door . Mother jumped to her feet and followed him outside . We were all outside by the time Phil dumped the books at the curb . " I 'm telling you , Jessie , " Father said , " that boy 's a hellion . " " Pick up those books right now , " said Mother . Instead , Phil took a small bottle from his pocket and poured its liquid on the books . Mother , seeing the match , tried to grab his arm , but it was too late . She pulled him back from the burst of flames . Father took off his belt . " I 'll teach you to burn your mother 's property . " But Mother held him off , protecting Phil with her body . " Jessie , you 're spoiling the boy , " yelled Father , waiting for her to step aside . " It 's his way . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's trying to help . " " You call this help ? Pretty soon the whole damn neighborhood 'll be out here . It 's crazy  --  " " It 's not ! It 's what the doctor said . " Father stopped short , lowering the hand that held his belt . Margie started crying and buried her face in my mother 's blouse . Phil never said a word . He just stood there watching the pages curl and float upward , the red sparks rising into darkness . The burning of my mother 's library turned out to be a practical matter , since the recovery period for eye strain went on longer than anyone imagined , and because the tent provided no space or protection for books . But the tent 's limitations seemed a small matter once my mother worked her magic . The children 's bedroom consisted of four cots separated from the main living area by Grandmother 's sideboard and china cabinet . The long sofa , Grandmother 's cedar trunk , and the kitchen table and chairs crowded the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provided heat and cooked our meals . Mother and Father 's narrow room was on the other side of Grandmother 's armoire and a rickety chest of drawers , where Father put two cots close together . On hot days the air in the tent was heavy and our clothes and skin began to smell like damp canvas . But even in summer the nights were often cold and wet , the dew making the tent sag , and we were thankful for the dry heat of the wood stove . During rainy days we watched for seam leaks , setting out pots and pans . We tried to ignore the maddening howl of wind , and we prayed that stakes and ropes would keep the roof in place . If we needed anything during stretches of bad weather it was privacy . I felt on those endless days of confinement the first stirrings of resentment . I longed to escape the watchful gaze of Mother and Father , to rebel against the petty tyrannies of my brothers and sister . Time dragged under the steady drone of rain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us shivered in our blankets , talking when we could think of something to say , feeling uneasy and cramped . Boredom was a subtle taskmaster , weighing us down , making us restless , instructing us in the cruelties of impatience . When Myron hit Margie , or Phil and I started fighting , Mother would always intervene , scolding us for our failure , our lack of imagination . Then she would distract us by telling a story or singing a song . On days when she felt tired , she would pull out the Sears Roebuck catalog , the only book that survived Phil 's rampage , and we entertained ourselves for hours , reading about electric trains and bicycles , making lists of all the items we would buy . At the top of Phil 's list were a bowie knife and a pair of high-top boots . I wanted a black cowboy hat and a pair of chaps . We read our lists to Mother , and she folded them carefully and put them in Grandmother 's cedar trunk , saying " Maybe someday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it brought freedom , and life everywhere began again . Wagons lumbered down the muddy road , delivering ice and baked goods to the big farms . Trucks carried eggs and milk to the markets in Cleveland . We heard tractors and harvesters rumbling early in the morning , buzz saws downing trees , and the voices of men barking orders , shouting over the machinery . About two miles down the road and masked by a row of evergreen trees was an abandoned construction site . A developer before the crash had dreamt of building an entire suburb between the farms , but he gave up after he dug four holes and poured the basement floors and walls . Rain and runoff collected in these deep , concrete bowls , sometimes as much as two or three feet , forming shallow pools that in the landscape of our games became oceans , lakes , ponds , and moats . It would 've been a desolate place if not for a band of noisy ducks that , winding their way up from the river , made for themselves a giant birdbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held Margie 's hands as we walked on the narrow tops of the basement walls , following a mother and her young , throwing a few crusts of bread into the water . Then Margie thought Myron should see the ducks , so it became a routine that after heavy rain the four of us would hike down the road to watch the birds bathing and splashing . Margie played mother to Myron , holding his hand and explaining the situation . " The ducks waddle up from the river , " she said , " because they like a change of scenery . " " Ma-Ma-Margie , " said Myron . " I want a du  --  a du  --  " Myron closed his eyes . " A duck . " " We ca n't take a little one away from its mother , " said Margie . " But she wo n't m-m-miss just one . " " Do you think Mother would miss you ? " Myron nodded . " Well what makes you think it 's any different for a duck ? " Myron shrugged . Margie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the wall and into the water . " What are you doing ? " screamed Myron . " I 'm scaring you . You 're stuttering too much . You need to concentrate more . " " L-L-Leave  --  " " See , " said Margie . " Now relax . " " L-L-Leave me alone , " said Myron . We knew that Myron stopped stuttering when he was surprised or scared , so we often sneaked up on him or exploded paper bags behind his back . We thought the right jolt at the right moment would cure his stuttering forever . " Cut it out you two , " said Phil . " Or we 'll go back . And remember , do n't tell Mom and Dad we came here . " Keeping a secret was a challenge for Margie and Myron , but they never let on about our trips to the construction site . We knew that Mother would make us promise to keep off the narrow walls , to stay away from the concrete pits whether they were empty or filled with water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made it off-limits even before we pitched the tent . So the aborted suburb became our secret place ; we understood its dangers and wanted to explore its recesses with impunity . There were other dangers and secrets in the woods , and we knew that looking out for each other was our only salvation . We never went as far as the Mayfield landfill ; its stench was a warning that turned us away . We imagined bizarre diseases . We imagined insanity . And there was the driedup well at Carson 's Bend where years ago a farmer filling his bucket brought up an eyeball from the bloated corpse of a boy . Phil and I stopped once at the well , a circle of stone covered with thick planks , and I pictured something dark living at the bottom of the cold , waterless shaft . But more than anything else we were afraid of an old man who lived in a black shack on the other side of the river . We called him Wormwood . We heard the word first from Grandmother when she talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die wanted to sell her . " We all end up in wormwood , " she said . The old man , who was our closest neighbor , walked with a stiff back and always wore a black hat , a long , black coat , and the look of a criminal caught unexpectedly in the act of a grave sin . " Look at that wormy face , " said Phil . " Old Wormwood is up to no good . " I took Phil 's lead . " He must eat nails for supper , " I said . The dog days ran toward September , and we became children of the outdoors , moving half-naked through the woods . On the hottest days we swam in the Chagrin , and on one of those days old Wormwood came down to the river 's edge and watched us for a long time . He finally took off his shoes and socks and , sitting on a long , flat stone , put his feet in the water . I swam toward Phil . " Let 's get upstream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margie . " We 'll swallow toejam if we stay here , " I said . " You 're sick , " said Margie . She turned toward Wormwood . " Do you really think he kidnaps little kids and cuts off their heads and keeps them in his cabin ? " " How little ? " asked Myron . " I told you before , " said Phil . " He does n't keep any heads . " " I wo n't use that rock after he 's been there , " I said . " Maybe he 's p-p-planning to c-c-come in after us . " " He ca n't swim , " said Phil . " That 's a good thing , " I said . " He 'd turn the river black if he got in all the way . " " Do you think he ever takes a bath ? " asked Margie . " Once a year , " I said . " He 's l-l-lucky . " We laughed , and Phil dunked Myron from behind . Long , dark weeds like tentacles wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Old Wormwood 's got you ! " Margie screamed and whirled in the water to escape the weeds . " You see , " I said . " If Wormwood keeps his feet in much longer , we 'll choke . " " He 's weird , " said Margie . " He wants something , " said Phil . And as the words left Phil 's mouth I saw what it was . Margie stood thigh-deep in the cool stream , squeezing water from her long hair , and the soaked T-shirt tied just beneath her breasts did nothing to conceal her hard nipples . For the first time I saw Margie 's breasts , large breasts for a girl who was just thirteen , and the sudden revelation of her womanhood was not wasted on Wormwood . He knelt on the rock , transfixed by the vision of my sister rising out of the water . His body was rigid , too rigid , the posture of a supplicant , and so when his lips began to move I knew that prayer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like poetry . I thought I heard him asking for God 's help , praying for divine intervention , begging God for just a glimpse of Margie drying herself , peeling the wet shorts and T-shirt from her body . I knew what Wormwood wanted . I looked at Phil and he too was staring at Wormwood , seeing the desire in Wormwood 's face . " Margie , come ' ere , " yelled Phil . Margie dove toward us . " He 's looking  --  " I said . " I know , " said Phil , cutting me off . Margie surfaced with a mouthful of water and shot it in Phil 's face . " Do you need me to save you from drowning ? " " Let 's get Myron and head back , " said Phil . " Already ? Let 's wait for Wormwood to leave . Then we can sit on the rock for a while . " " No . I do n't think so . " " Why not ? " " Do n't ask me why , Margie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah . There 's not much sun today , " I said . " What do you mean ? " asked Margie . " Too many clouds . " Margie looked at the sky . " You 're both crazy . I 'm going to wait until Wormwood leaves . " Phil and I stayed near Margie , and I watched Wormwood 's eyes follow her through the water , and I guessed that on days when we used the rock for sunning ourselves that he had been somewhere nearby . I used my body to block Wormwood 's view , and once he tried to look around me , craning his neck and leaning over so far that he almost fell in the water . Margie finally got tired of waiting , and the four of us climbed the bank on our side of the river . " At least he stays over there , " said Phil . We waited for Margie to finish dressing . I knew no one we could tell , not Father or Mother , and certainly not Margie . We had no words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as the dog days drew sweat , and Margie 's skin turned a glowing bronze , Phil and I watched for Wormwood at the river and in the woods , beneath stones and in the shadows of giant trees , at all the edges of our world . September broke the heat and my dream of an endless summer . We enrolled at Mayfield School , despite the fact that we had no mailing address or telephone , and the Registrar , who was Todd Lincoln 's mother , said , " This is all highly irregular . " She said it more than once , and she shook her head while my mother assured her that our current situation was temporary . We did n't see Todd Lincoln 's mother very often after that . She came to school two or three times in a semester to help Miss Dossin with official paperwork . But Todd , of course , was in school from the first day , and he ran around the schoolyard pointing at us and saying our names , telling everyone that we were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids asked us what it was like , and in their voices was a sense of wonder . We were , after all , living the kind of outdoor adventure that their parents would never allow . But most of the kids looked at us like we were from another country , or they laughed and felt superior , luxuriating in the knowledge that we were worse off than they . " Where do you get your water ? " asked Todd . " From a well on Mr. Johnson 's property , " said Margie . " He said we could use it for as long as we need to . " " You drink the water out of Johnson 's old well ? " " We boil it first . " " What if someone went and pissed in that well . " " C'm on , Margie , " I said . " I guess Todd goes around pissing in wells . " Todd looked at Margie . " Where do you go to the bathroom ? " " In your shoe , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Todd . " Go ahead , " said Phil , materializing out of the air , twisting Todd 's arm , whispering in his ear . " If you do , I 'll hurt you . " Phil let his breath settle in Todd 's ear , and then he let him go . Todd ran to the company of his friends and pretended that nothing had happened . He tried not to look at Phil . Power in the schoolyard shifted on a daily basis , but the indefatigable master of the schoolhouse was Miss Dossin , teaching all of her students , grades three through twelve , in one room . She was kind and beautiful , stern and demanding . " Mr. Lincoln , take off your cap . " " My mother lets me wear my cap in the house , Miss Dossin . " " Your mother runs your house . I run this classroom . I will not ask you again . " I believe that Phil 's considerable affection for Miss Dossin began at the moment Todd Lincoln took off his cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expediency of being painfully direct , but she also exercised the art of discretion . She knew that my family lived in a tent , but she never said anything about it . She showed her concern for us by never asking for a mailing address or telephone number . She understood that the four of us had to stick together . She encouraged us to share each other 's triumphs and failures , and she allowed us to shield each other against the teasing and practical jokes of our classmates . On the third day of school , Miss Dossin called on Myron and asked him to read aloud . Myron shrank behind Felda Lane . " Let 's look alive , Mr. Tollman . Pick up your book and read the first paragraph of chapter one . " Margie raised her hand . " I 'd like to read , Miss Dossin . " " Did I call on you , young lady ? " Margie lowered her eyes and shook her head . " I thought not . I believe I did call on your brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open the book . Phil cracked his knuckles and everyone around him started giggling . " Philip Tollman , I 'm not impressed by your bone cracking demonstration . If you continue to practice that disgusting habit , your knuckles will grow bigger than boulders . And do n't think for a moment that your little diversion will save your brother from reading . Myron , please stand . " The situation was hopeless . Myron pulled himself out of his desk and opened the book . " Sir I-I-Isaac New-New-Newton  --  " Then laughter buried the rest of the sentence . " Children ! Children ! " Miss Dossin regained control . " Myron , do you always stutter ? " " Yes , Miss Daw-Daw-Dossin . " The laughter began again , but Miss Dossin cut it off . " Anyone who thinks that Myron 's stutter is funny will deal with me after school . " No one laughed at Myron in the presence of Miss Dossin after that . But her authority , inviolable as it was , could n't protect Myron outside the schoolhouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , further evidence of our inferiority . Todd Lincoln led the assault with a barrage of consonants exploding from his lips . He sprayed saliva and tied his tongue in knots for the entertainment of his friends . " Hey , sh-sh-shit for brains , " said Todd , looking to see if Phil was anywhere nearby . " How abow-bow-bout a speech ? " Todd 's friends joined the fun . " Speech ! Speech ! C'm on Moron , give us the Gettysburg Address . " Phil sometimes broke it up ; other times it was Margie or me . I know that Myron took more than we knew about . " Come ' ere Moron , " said Felda . " His name is Myron , " said Margie . " That 's what I said . " Margie 's face turned red . " You said Moron . " " That 's right , " said Felda . " I said his name . " All this was bad enough , but then I had to make things worse . I had to give Todd and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Tollmans were trash . I woke on the first day of October with cramps and nausea . It felt like the flu , but I knew it was the fish from the night before . Phil and I had each caught one , but mine hardly struggled . It just went limp on the line . I had n't thought much about it until I woke up with my stomach turning . Mother felt my forehead and face , and since I had no fever , she said I should go to school . I went . I started sweating by mid-morning . " Your face is green , " said Margie . I looked at my reflection in the glass but could see no color . Miss Dossin asked me twice if I needed to go to the outhouse . I shook my head , trying to control the stomach cramps that came in unexpected waves . I was grateful when Miss Dossin assigned my grade an hour of reading ; she came by my desk and rubbed the back of my neck and told me not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . I closed my eyes and the rustling and whispering in the room lulled me to sleep . It was lunchtime soon , and the room filled with the smell of peanut butter , pickles , warm cheese , and milk . Then , without much warning , something warm shot up into my throat and vomit flooded my desk . It ran down the back of Cory Weiner , dripping off my hands in long , sticky strings . After that I heard my name . It was Miss Dossin 's voice . She stood above the scene looking at my puke , calling it my name . " Stephen , " she said . " Oh , Stephen . " I ran away from the screams and laughter and found the relative safety of the outhouse , leaving Miss Dossin and Phil to clean up the mess . My stomach felt better after I washed my face and cleaned my shirt , but Miss Dossin said that I should leave . Phil told me later that the smell was awful , so bad that Miss Dossin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schoolhouse into a vomitory changed my position in the established social hierarchy ; I fell from town peasant to town fool , assuming the mantle of scapegoat and giving Myron amuch needed reprieve . My classmates made me the sole recipient of their invectives . They called me pukey , puke-head , puke-brain , puke-face , puke-breath , puke-shit , pukeprick , and just plain puke . When I walked into the coatroom , most of the kids held their noses . When I stood in line for the outhouse , the kids closest to me started gagging . I enjoyed a status usually reserved for the elderly or the insane . I had to take it . I could n't blame anyone else for what had happened , and some of the kids felt sorry for me and said that it would all be forgotten by Thanksgiving . But Cory Weiner always took the long way around me and never spoke to me again . After a while I fancied myself a martyr , accepting the role of scapegoat as a service to Myron . But just when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classmates again fixing their sights on Myron . " Did you teach Moron your little trick ? " someone asked . " Moron 's just like his big brother , " said Felda . " He does n't know whether to stutter or puke first , " said Todd . " Get Moron over here , " someone said . " Ask him if he stutters when he pukes . " My days as an object of ridicule were numbered . I was glad for relief , but sorry that my replacement was Myron . " Time , " Lethea said , " purifies the most desecrated ground . " I held those strange words in my mind while the weeks of October moved forward , changing the landscape with a new season , filling the woods with a firestorm of leaves . I remember my mother squinting at the maples , not knowing it would be her last autumn of color . Phil and I , Margie and Myron too , rolled in the leaves , red and yellow covering our bodies like tongues of flame . We showered each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with elm leaves , the last children of dying trees . We ran , making a swishing sound as the leaves swirled upward and fluttered.We flung ourselves into piles of leaves , sometimes face down , breathing the smoky dust of tree bark , covering ourselves with October 's deep blanket . Phil picked up leaves of different shapes and sizes and pressed them with the flowers in Mother 's book . When he found out that red was Miss Dossin 's favorite color , he collected all the different shades of red that he could find and made a bouquet of leaves . Then he stayed after school one day so he could give it to Miss Dossin when no one would see him . " Did she like it ? " I asked . " You do n't see it , do you ? " " You could 've ditched it before you got back here . " I looked out through the door of the tent ; Mom and Dad were nowhere in sight . " What did she say ? " " She said Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've said more than that . " " She did . " " But you wo n't tell me . " " No . " " Why not ? " Phil took a deep breath . " Because things between a man and woman are private . " " Since when are you a man ? " " Since he fell in love , " said Margie , coming out from behind Grandmother 's china cabinet . " Love ? ! " " That 's right , " Margie exclaimed . " He 's in love with Miss Dossin . " " You do n't know what you 're talking about , " said Phil , turning away . I was old enough to understand the attraction . A figure like Miss Dossin already lived in my waking dreams . I wanted to know what my brother felt . " I 'm gon na tell Mom you have a crush on Miss Dossin , " I said . " Shut up . " " I will . I 'll tell her unless you tell me and Margie what Miss Dossin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was the first and only time he used my schoolhouse name . " You wo n't be Mom 's favorite anymore if she knows you 're in love with Miss Dossin . " Phil sprang on me and pinned my shoulders to the cot . He raised his open hand and I braced for the blow . Then Margie caught his arm and he froze , looking at her and then at me . I was scared . I wondered why he stopped . But the look on his face told me not to say a word . It was a strange expression , mixing anger and sadness . Phil let go of me and rushed out of the tent . " Why did you say that about Mom ? " asked Margie . " What about me ? " asked Mother , coming into the tent . " Oh , nothing , " said Margie . I closed my eyes and thought of Miss Dossin , the girls at school , the picture of Aunt Frances in her sleeveless gown , the world of women that seemed suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Having worn me out as a target , Todd again set his sights on Myron , intending to make up for lost time . Everyone said that Todd saw his chance when Miss Dossin pulled Myron aside and asked him to stay after school . But it started well before that . Todd was no different than most boys . In him was the need , the sharp longing , to corner a living thing and render it helpless . Setting the trap excited him . He enjoyed each step , the design and the execution . I could picture it all as if I 'd been there myself . I imagined the conversations between Todd and his two cronies , imitating Myron 's struggle to speak and laughing to hide their own fears , their own inarticulate terror . I constructed the sequence of events : the meeting in Todd 's barn to think of something that would mark Myron forever as a moron , an idiot , a fool who found it impossible to make the simplest sounds . I heard their first moans of exhilaration as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparations , breaking into the Church of St. Blaise and cutting a thin wire from a high octave of the piano . Then passing the piano wire between themselves , keeping it warm in their pockets , until the day that Miss Dossin asked Myron to stay after school so she could help him form words , form phrases without faltering and falling into frustration . So they waited for him between the schoolhouse and the woods , waited until his lesson was over , until pride rose to his throat because he managed a full sentence without stuttering . They waited until Myron was close to the well at Carson 's Bend , and then they forced him to the ground and Todd 's friends , big boys with strong Midwestern shoulders , squeezed Myron 's jaw until the pain made him open his mouth , and they held his mouth open while Todd tried to grab Myron 's tongue , failing at first , the pink tip slipping between his fingers , but then Myron stuck out his tongue , believing Todd 's promise that if he did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire around the tongue while the other boys made jokes about Myron being tongue-tied for real . Todd wound the wire three times around the tongue and pulled gently , oh so gently , and then Myron gagged and a faint line of blood ran down the wire , and the boys released his jaw and left him to find his way home . When Myron got to the tent he could barely speak ; his tongue was swollen and still bleeding . Mother stuffed gauze in Myron 's mouth to soak up the blood , but she could n't see well enough to clean the wound . Father did the work . " There 's only one cut , " he said . " On the side of his tongue . And thank God it 's not very deep . " Mother and Father went to school the next day and talked to Miss Dossin about Todd Lincoln and his friends . The punishment involved an apology to Myron , a promise to never touch him again , and a two-week suspension . Phil did nothing for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited until Todd and his friends felt that all was forgotten , until they felt safe . And when he was certain that the boys expected no recrimination , he clipped my father 's hunting knife to his belt and walked through the twilight to Todd 's barn , with me close behind . We surprised the boys , bursting in through the closed doors . Todd made a run for the hayloft ladder , but Phil tackled him and pulled my father 's knife out of its sheath and held it to Todd 's throat . Todd 's friends had the idea to jump Phil , but when they saw the knife , they backed away . " Keep going , " said Phil . " Good . That 's far enough . Now do n't move . If you move , I 'll cut his throat . " Phil nodded to me and I closed the doors . Todd made no sound beneath the knife . " Your friends ca n't help you this time , " said Phil . I looked at Todd 's friends , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . Phil held him from behind , squeezing Todd 's elbows together with one arm and holding the knife in front of Todd 's ashen face . " If you stick out your tongue , I promise I 'll let you go . " Todd began to cry . " Do n't hurt me , " he screamed . Phil choked off Todd 's air with the back of his hand . " I wo n't . " Phil loosened his hold . " But I want you to taste my knife . " " You 're crazy . " " That 's right . But not like you . Not crazy enough to wrap wire around a small boy 's tongue . My brother never asked to stutter  --  but he was cursed by God and then by you . " Phil squeezed Todd 's arms until something cracked . Todd 's tongue touched the knife , and Phil drew the blade across it , ever so gently , until it bled . Todd collapsed to his knees , crying and swallowing blood . Phil put the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone that I did this to you , or if your friends tell anyone , I 'll kill you . " Phil and I walked out into the darkness , and when the barn was no longer in sight , I asked him if he meant what he said about killing Todd . He gave me no answer , and his silence made me feel empty and absolutely alone .
