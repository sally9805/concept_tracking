THE TROUBLE WITH SIN was that once you started , there was no stopping . Moses Rosen had imagined that he would grow up to become a rabbi , and then , sixteen years old , his Knoxville childhood having slithered past in the waning days of the 1890s , he met a girl who through her many beauties of the flesh inspired him to invite Jesus into his heart . Brother , she had said , would you be saved . Brother , would you save me . And she guided his hand to where salvation beckoned . <p> She was fifteen years old , the daughter of the Reverend Brownlee Kane . A week later , Pastor Kane baptized Moses in the Holston River , his large , strong hands gripping Moses 's head as if to burst it open , plunging him into the muddy water , cool even in June , while all around him hallelujahs and amens rang out . Risen , he stepped from the water and into the arms of Rena Sue Kane-Sister Rena Sue , he was now to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her long , thick hair , the yellow-white color of sweet corn , gathered at the top of her head like a crown . <p> In the house of his father he continued to pass as a good son , faithful to the letter of the law while secretly opposed to the spirit of it . During the evening hours he played the violin , often in duets with his father , who taught lessons at the university . They played Bach , Mozart , Corelli , Haydn . One evening a week , pale professors in seedy frock coats , black cases dangling from their long arms , and occasionally a pianist , a woman with long , dark hair coiled atop her head in thick braids , appeared and adjourned to his father 's library , where they played for hours . Sometimes Moses was invited to join them , though he tended to lose his way among the several parts , hearing himself now in the cello , now in the viola , now in the pounding chords of the piano , and even at times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alone , he played the Bach partitas , in which he heard , from time to time , when lucky , the very sound of mercy . This sound he 'd heard , albeit faintly , all his life , first in his father 's violin , before he understood a word of speech , and surely in his mother 's voice as she sang arias slightly off-key in the kitchen , snatches of phrases , the briefest of passages suddenly atremble with eternal intent . <p> Some nights he pored over the handsome New Testament given him by Brother Brownlee Kane at the revival meeting on the banks of the Holston , a Bible with tables in the back that listed the major miracles , their nature , by whom wrought , and where . Other nights he slipped out of his father 's house and into the arms of Sister Rena Sue , meeting her in her father 's darkened church , the Evangelical Church of Jesus the Redeemer . <p> We should marry , he had told her . <p> I ca n't marry you , Moses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm impure . <p> Oh , Lord , Rena Sue . Honey . <p> It 's all right , she said . I 'd rather be impure than married any day . Just love me , Moses , and stop talking about marriage , OK ? <p> They were sitting on the front pew , the farthest from a window and most distant from the door . The door was never locked , the Reverend Kane believing that a church must always be open , ready to receive believers and sinners at any hour . Could you predict mercy ? Could you measure out grace between daybreak and dusk ? Was despair to be regulated , repentance timed ? No ! the Reverend Kane shouted , pounding his large fist on the pulpit , his deep voice resounding as if in song . <p> Moses had slipped out of his father 's house as soon as he dared , making his way across town through moonlit alleys , the smell of garbage thick in the damp night air until he emerged at last on the Maynardville Pike , where the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its steepleless little bell-tower and its scrawny rosebushes on either side of the broad double door . Alongside the church , across a space no greater than the length of a body , squatted the parsonage , A single-storey white frame house with a sad excuse for a front porch , its roof supported by a couple of unpainted four-by-fours . He did not like to look at the house as he approached the church , so easy it was to imagine the Reverend Kane asleep within , his Bible on the nightstand , his dream of ascending to the heavenly city , his great head deep in goosedown , his unrelenting breath . Next to him , the Reverend Mrs. Kane surely dreamed of Rena Sue 's redemption . A plump but pale woman with sad , deep-set blue eyes , Mrs. Kane was said to have died several years ago and come back to life . Moses did not doubt it . <p> Even when it was pitch-dark outside , he could see Rena Sue so plainly she might have been illuminated . She had her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he had pointed this out , she said it was not so , it did not signify , she was nobody but herself . On the night he proposed to her , a night in which a crescent moon rose lovely over Sharp 's Ridge , she wore her thick yellow hair in a single braid behind with a white flower clipped to one side , and when she moved close to him her lips , though edged by light , shone darkly . <p> What if your father comes in ? Moses had asked . <p> He never wakes , she said . Even when he 's not asleep , he 's never awake . <p> And your mother ? <p> Same story . Some are reborn after the first death . She ai n't one of them . <p> Moses was n't convinced . Stretched out on the front pew , Rena Sue on top of him , taking him into her , a stray hair tickling his nose , her breasts soft and warm against his naked chest , her hips moving in time with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mind , Pastor Brownlee Kane waking from a troubled sleep , rising from his bed , enjoined by God to stop his slumber , go catch the sinners in their blasphemy . <p> But not once during the two years they met there , each Tuesday and Thursday in the sweet dead of night , was Brother Brownlee Kane awakened , either by God 's nudge or his daughter 's moan . And afterwards , as Moses walked briskly back across Knoxville , the wind burning his cheeks , the sky on the verge of light , he uttered two prayers : that he be forgiven for his sinful ways , and that Jesus never disturb Pastor Kane 's sleep . <p> His sense of sin , he finally realized , would never be strong enough to overtake his desire for Rena Sue , and so in the beginning of his nineteenth year , the summer after his graduation from high school , he fled Knoxville for Oklahoma City , where his Uncle Ezra would employ him as a clerk in his " lending establishment . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote . It 's a modern up-to-date city with trolleys and all conveniences . Civilized . <p> Moses did not care for civilization . He did not want convenience . He wanted a wilderness . Across the Mississippi and into Arkansas , which from the window of the swaying railroad car looked like the fathomless plain of his longest nightmares , he felt he could not after all ever contain his soul , that it was out there in the vast stillness that only appeared to be moving , that only seemed to be changing . Clouds formed , dark and plump , hurriedly grouped , then scattered . The sky kept pushing its way through . Trees suddenly appeared , branches like veins . <p> Across the aisle sat a woman in a skirt whose hem rose to the edge of her ankle when she crossed her legs . She crossed her legs often . The flickering sunlight made her stockings gleam . She wore a white pleated skirt and white shoes with pointed toes and Queen Anne heels . The flesh beneath the long skirt constantly announced its presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pawn shop . Arranging and rearranging the unredeemed watch fobs , the silent mantel clocks , the heavy and smelly saddles , the ladies ' brooches and glass-gemmed necklaces , the pistols , rifles , mandolins , boots and belts and warped-necked guitars and bent wedding rings , the array of tarnished spittoons and chamberpots , horn-pronged hatracks and ivory back-scratchers , Moses fended off memories of Rena Sue and craved times when he might stand at the counter and snatch glimpses from the window of ladies in new silks gliding by . <p> Evenings he played his violin , polishing the repertoire passed on to him by his father , the Bach partitas , the double concerto ( sometimes playing first violin , sometimes second ) , the Mendelssohn , the Beethoven , the Paganini , the Brahms . He was competent , he knew , but knew as well his limits . Express , his father was fond of exclaiming , always express , as if the spirit of the music might be sped toward his fiddle by mail if only Moses knew where to submit his order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . Well , but he knew how much . Everything you had , body and soul . It was no cut-rate deal . <p> In the Oklahoma City churches he attended , sitting on hard pews that made him remember Brother Brownlee Kane 's Evangelical Church of Jesus the Redeemer and Sister Rena Sue stretched atop him , he sang the Christian hymns passionately , earnestly , badly . Worse , much to his embarrassment , he began to hear in his voice something of the old quaver and solemn lilt of the Hebrew chants , as if his father , in league with his grandfather and a squadron of rabbis , had a stranglehold on his throat . Certainly this distinctly Jewish cadence and pitch was inappropriate for a hymn such as , say , " A Soldier of the Cross , " and when a woman turned to look at him he strained for a Baptist intonation , a Methodist resonance , without knowing exactly what that might be , which landed him in some musical neverland , a mongrel tenor baying at the cross . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past ! He met and loved to the best of his ability and the limits imposed by his heart one woman after another , losing each of them , some after a matter of weeks , some-though considerably fewer-after several years , lost them in the main through his own sadly flawed character , which condemned him to intense but brief loving and doomed him to lust for the woman glimpsed , overheard , sniffed in the eternal Oklahoma wind . Through it all , he was haunted by the memory of Rena Sue Kane , as if she were loss incarnate . <p> His mother died during the World War . Grieving , Moses enlisted and was shipped to England , where he spent the remainder of the war recovering from the Spanish flu , plagued by a recurring dream in which Rena Sue Kane climbed into his sickbed and tried to push him onto the floor . He recovered , returned to Oklahoma City , grateful that he had n't been required , finally , to plunge a bayonet into the gut of a German , possibly a descendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stroke while blowing into the mouthpiece of a recently acquired French horn . In August of 1925 , Moses returned to Knoxville for his father 's death and then began to sort through his father 's possessions , estimating their value . <p> He started in the storeroom adjoining the kitchen , where his mother had stored jars of preserved fruit , vegetables , chow-chow . As he began his inventory of ancient Mason jars , he found at the end of a shelf a box wrapped in newspaper tied with grocer 's twine . He 'd thought it would be canned goods his father meant to donate to the needy , and as he cut the twine he was struck with a sudden image of his mother during the canning season , singing arias over the steamy , tomato-filled pots . Tears welled in his eyes by the time he lifted off the newspaper and saw the shiny oak box with the brass hinges . <p> Cutlery ? Silverware ? A box of fine linens ? Long experience in the business of delinquent redemption had made a skeptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lifted the lid . Three dark knobs rose up , calibrated , from a polished pine surface . It was a radio . Radios were still novel enough in 1925 not to appear often in the shop , except for crude , rudimentary crystal sets , clumsily assembled by amateurs . How astonishing to find that his father , who in Moses 's childhood had refused to purchase a phonograph , owned a radio receiver ! In this house , Moses remembered his father announcing , we make our own music . <p> But at some point , years after Moses 's departure , Father purchased a great mahogany console , its shiny brass lily-shaped horn embossed with lute-playing cherubs , and on his deathbed he had asked Moses to carry up the heavy machine from downstairs and play him a wax-cylinder recording of Caruso 's voice singing Canio from Pagliacci . <p> A radiol Well . It seemed an expensive model , its complicated system of tubes and wires hidden inside the box , its speaker built in . He lifted it off the shelf-heavy it was-and carried it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio station in Knoxville . They were cropping up everywhere , though . Even Oklahoma City had one . <p> He easily tuned in the station . The first thing he heard was a hymn , a choir singing " Rest Me in My Savior 's Arms , " the voices a little staticky but not without a certain power . He knew the hymn and soon was singing along . <p> Then he heard a woman 's voice : I am come to tell you , the voice sang out . I am come to tell you the Good News ! <p> He recognized immediately the voice of Rena Sue Kane . <p> She was called " The Angel of the Airwaves , " and she was in Knoxville for three nights , part of a tour that had taken her all across Tennessee . Two evenings Moses listened to her on his father 's radio . The broadcast was live , the announcer said , originating at the evangelist 's large revival tent in Fountain City , at the northern edge of Knoxville . Listeners were urged to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be saved . <p> That was a long time ago , he told himself , almost twenty years . I 'm a different person now than I was in those days when we met in her father 's church on the Maynardville Pike . I went out to Oklahoma , did n't I , and that has made all the difference . I do n't need to see her again . I 'm no longer a religious person . I can not be saved again . <p> Why then did her voice thrill him so ? Why , he asked himself , do I continue to listen to the claims of a woman I loved in my youth ? <p> The third evening , in order to prove to himself that he did not need to listen to her , he left the house . He would take his supper at a restaurant and then find some entertainment . It was not good to dwell so long among his father 's things , sorting and sifting . Even the violins his father had owned , one of them a beautiful Bergonzi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent mediocre . <p> When he boarded the trolley on Broadway and sat rocking along northward toward Fountain City , he kept telling himself he would get off at the next corner . I can go back at any time , he kept telling himself . <p> Beneath the tent were three sections of benches , each section composed of about fifty rows . Dark forms hunched on the benches , packed shoulder to shoulder , and men stood along the side and at the back of the tent . It was oppressively warm and smelled of sweat and dust , hay and coal oil . Moses stood in the rear among a group of men who shuffled back and forth , their jaws swollen with tobacco , hands in pockets , jingling coins and keys . <p> Dressed all in white-flowing white , diaphanous white , essence of white-Rena Sue Kane came soaring into the space at the front of the tent . Jesus , he thought . God have mercy . She had been a girl coming into her womanhood ; now every curve and camber of her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been long and yellow-white as new corn now glowed darker , deep gold like the backs of certain old fiddles . <p> She stopped in front of a radio enunciator on a four-foot-tall stand , letting her hands touch the shiny steel rod while a small , baldheaded man adjusted the height to the level of her mouth . This was accomplished quickly , as though it were the most natural thing in the world for her to be speaking in this way to a congregation that was not present as well as to those who had come to see her in person . He supposed she had done it many times , after all , in other cities . Now she surveyed the crowd , smiling , nodding at several whom she either recognized or pretended to . The baldheaded man raised his arm , held it high , then let it swiftly fall , and at the instant his arm fell , hers rose up . She pointed to the crowd , letting the long finger single out first one person and then the next , right to left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been mistaken-to him and stopping there . <p> She could n't have recognized him , though , standing as he was in the dimly lit portion of the tent , all in shadow . But she pointed at him longer than at anyone else , she looked into his eyes , he could swear , and she kept pointing . A deep hush fell in the vast tent . <p> People ) she suddenly announced , pointing now to the ceiling , her voice booming and yet the voice of a woman , the voice of a womanly Rena Sue Kane , no mistaking it . People , she said , you ai n't seen nothing yet . No . Nothing ) I 'm here to tell you , until you have seen the Holy Ghost , it 's all sham and shilly-shally . You will speak with the tongues of angels and hear the golden bells ringing when you 've been reborn in the fire of the Holy Spirit . Jesus will take you , yes , Jesus is the one that will set that fire , stoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Amen ) somebody shouted . <p> Hallelujah ! <p> Praise God ! <p> Yes , the Angel of the Airwaves said , yes , brethren and sistern , I know what I am called , praise God , but I am here to tell you I am no angel . No , sir . No , ma'am . I have sinned , sinned and been sinned against as fragrantly as the next person . For I am a human bein ' , fellow sinners , my mama and daddy was human bein 's , and I live on this earth , as much a human bein ' as the next fellow . <p> Fragrantly ? Moses thought . Surely he had misheard her . But fragrant , indeed , was the sin of Rena Sue Kane those long-ago nights upon the pews of her father 's church . Sweet the smell and sound when in the throes of her passion she wrapped her legs around me and I knew heaven on earth , my seed shot forth , my cannon fired , the great rod reamed out , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my loins . <p> Why , my daddy was a preacher , she continued , and when I was a little girl , perched upon his knee , I thought for sure he was a holy man and could do no wrong . <p> He was a human bein ' , I 'm here to tell you , bless his heart , as much a human bein ' as the next fellow . Oh , yes , I found that out . A man of God is not immune to temptation , nor able always to resist it . No , sir . Daddy was a sinner , and if he was here this minute in the flesh as I know he is in spirit , I know he would say Amen , daughter ! Forgive me , Jesus ! <p> He needed to be sanctified , just like you and me . He needed to pray for anointment . <p> Amens and praise-Gods rang out . Moses contributed an amen himself , a little late , a little weakly , but he meant it nonetheless . <p> She was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression changed . She was stern , she was not just a little miffed , she was all business . <p> Why stand ye gazing up to heaven , she said . The sound from heaven will ring out , yes , it will chime , ye doubters , it will fill this house like a mighty rushing wind . <p> Could Jesus come to you in a sacrilegious memory ? You bet . That was exactly what He was up to , as far as Moses was concerned , firing Moses up with the memory of Rena Sue Kane at age sixteen , stretched out on that church pew naked as the day was long , her legs spread for him . Come to me , honey . Please , quick , now . He felt a tingling all up and down his body , his blood hot and churning , his breath coming quick , and along with these sensations came a sudden need to explain the apparent paradox of his remembered and current feelings to a grinning man leaning next to him , elbows poking into his ribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupting Sister Rena , his words and her words meeting and merging , amen and hallelujah . And so he spoke and was overcome with the spirit , just as when he had arisen from the waters of the Holston and Sister Rena Sue had stepped toward him from the shade trees along the banks , her arms outstretched . It was the new Sister Rena Sue who spoke through him now , it felt like , that woman whose garments trailed from her like wind , a beatific wind that pierced him through and through , the jab and thrust , the sweet , meticulous cut of Jesus ' knife . But she was the same as before , too . Have mercy . <p> All is a mystery , he explained to the grinning man . Blood and whatnot . <p> Music flew through the sweat-laden air , batted upwards and into fierce little cyclones by the rapid fluttering of ladies ' fans . It was not familiar to him , this music , nothing he had played or heard played , but without doubt it had burst from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervently . The grinning man stopped grinning , his mouth forming an O. He may have said Obadiah . Moses believed he did , though the word made no sense , came from no previous reference . Then the man took up the words of the music himself , so that Moses believed his point had been taken . The resulting duet was on the shrill side , he would have said in calmer moments , but now , Sister Rena Sue 's voice lilting from contralto to coloratura soprano , rising to take the lead , show them the true melody , the air might have been booming with God 's chords . He sang his heart out . <p> Music , too , came from a pump organ at the right front of the tent , a music reedy and trembling , made by a woman round from head to thighs , bouncing and swaying on a narrow bench . <p> It was almost enough to make you want to dance , and Moses , who felt rhythm , generally , in his head and hands , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . <p> I 'll just shuffle my feet a little , he told himself as he felt his body begin to shake . <p> There was widespread movement in the tent , skirts rustling , the murmur of voices , dust kicked up by shuffling feet . Someone moaned . Another gave out a kind of shriek . <p> Come forward , Sister Rena Sue said . Come forward , dear brethren and sistern , and those of you listening in on the airwaves , kneel down before your radios and accept the power . Let go , my people , let go of prideful resistance , let God have his way with you . Open up , come on , come quick now , come to the blood <p> The man next to him , the silly grin on his face again , said something that sounded like Oh , hello , sweetpea , honey of my heart , my cabbage , tiny Obadiah . Then he closed his eyes and fell to the ground , writhing and twisting , his fists flailing and pounding . Toward the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the air and fairly dived forward , landing with a grand thud on the hay-bestrewn ground , thrashing and shouting mightily . Hallelujahs burst forth , clapping in a dozen different rhythms broke out , someone banged on a tambourine , the organ achieved amazing volume , the round woman pumping and kicking at it , rolling on the bench . Some took to dancing , flinging their arms high , fingers shaking . Jesus was addressed by a considerable number . Sin was vehemently renounced , virtue affirmed . People surrounded the afflicted , cheering them on . <p> Yes , Rena Sue shouted , that 's right , open up , yes , let it go , let the flame lick and burn . <p> And then it was over , and people were streaming past him . He worked against them , pushing his way toward the front . <p> Bless you , sir , said a tiny woman whom he almost ran down . <p> A man took hold of his shoulder , said , Powerful testifying , bud . <p> He pulled free , ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance with him before he was able to get around and find the opening in the tent through which Rena Sue had passed . <p> The night air was cool , stars brilliant in the black sky . He heard the squeaking of wagon wheels , the roar of automobiles , murmuring of voices , the clatter of crickets in the dark trees . And there she was , coming toward him out of the middle dark in such a stately and lovely manner , the white gown flowing , that he fancied her his bride . <p> Rena Suet he called . Rena Suet <p> But beside her walked a man who looked very much a bridegroom in his black tailcoat with satin lapels , . white bow tie , white waistcoat , patent-leather shoes and spats . He carried a black silk tophat , a cane , and wore white gloves . A handsome fellow ! A handsome couple ! <p> Did you call me , sir ? Rena Sue Kane asked . <p> Did you want something , buster ? her dapper escort said . <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettily . <p> I was in there just now , Moses said . <p> And did you testify , mister ? she asked . <p> He thought he saw a faint glimmer of recognition in her eyes , or <p> at least an effort to place him . <p> I might have , he said . <p> State your business , mister , the tailcoated man said . <p> Roscoe , please , Rena Sue said , touching the fellow on the shoulder , which seemed instantly to calm him , and then stepping toward Moses , looking at him in earnest . Her proximity so unnerved him that he could n't think of what to say . It was as if he had forgotten his own name . Then she stepped back , again touched the shoulder of the man she called Roscoe , touched him while still looking at Moses , and said , Run along , sweetie . I 'll be there with you directly . <p> The man took a deep breath , swelling up his grand , white-encased chest , and then , mercifully , shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Moses felt short of breath . There was a smell , a bad smell from the direction of the departing sinners , a rotten smell , fumes from motorcars mixed with horse dung , and this smell brought back to him the nights when he 'd made his way across Knoxville from his father 's house to her father 's church , the smells from garbage cans wafting from the alleys , the moon rising above the squat frame houses , the darkened windows , the immaculate , dark , tiny lawns , the sense of lives withdrawn , hidden , made safe for the time being , of his own as dangerous , exciting . <p> He 'd do it all over again in an instant , deny the religion of his father for the sake of love . <p> Jesus God in heaven , Rena Sue said . It 's Moses , ai n't it ? <p> And then she was in his arms and he had that familiar warmth , as if the very heat of memory . He held her tight . <p> She pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? she asked him , as if he had been gone a day or two . <p> Oklahoma , he said . <p> And never one word , she said . <p> I feared for my soul , he said . <p> She laughed . <p> Oh , Moses . Moses Rosen . I remember your soul . Yes , I do . You 're right to fear for it . <p> And she extended her hand . He understood he was to take it , and he did . <p> She led him to the shore of a lake that glimmered in the very heart of Fountain City . He could not have said how long they walked . He did not think it had been very long . There were benches placed around this little lake , and upon one of these they sat , still hand in hand . <p> And your father ? he asked . <p> Dead as a doornail , she said . Why ? Did you admire my papa , Moses ? <p> He baptized me . <p> I remember . <p> Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Listen , she said , I got where I am through no help from that son of a bitch . <p> Her voice was calm , pleasant . <p> I 'm sorry , he said . <p> No fault of yours , she said . My father had a heart attack in the bed of a whore up in Johnson City . <p> She withdrew her hand , but let him take it back , and he moved closer to her . <p> Ai n't you the sweetheart , though ? she said . Did you get saved tonight , Moses ? Were you sanctified , honey ? Anointed in the blood of the lamb ? <p> I was powerfully moved . <p> Powerfully moved . Oh my goodness . Was it the Holy Ghost , or something else ? <p> I ca n't say what it was , Moses said . I felt-not myself . I was happy . <p> You knew me ? <p> Oh , yes . Yes , I knew you instantly . <p> I 'm not the same , though . <p> No . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , for one thing . <p> How did you ever figure that out ? <p> He knew she was making fun of him , but let it pass . There was much about him for honest amusement , he was sure , and , after all , she might well harbor some resentment toward him for leaving so suddenly , not even saying good-bye . His departure had initiated , he saw , a sort of pattern , one that he was not proud of , a pattern in which he withdrew , slipped away from the embrace of women whose love he believed he did not deserve . <p> I hope to God I 've changed , she said . <p> She actually bowed her head , closed her eyes . He let fly a short prayer : God help me , Amen . Opening his eyes , he saw that hers were still closed . Her hand in his was warm , smooth , small . He tried to imagine her a wife , a mother . <p> Do you ... have children ? he asked when at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She shook her head , but then said yes , she had a daughter . <p> Well , he said . Congratulations . <p> I gave her up . <p> Gave her up ? <p> Oh , Moses . You 're as slow as ever .

Louisville ? Have you heard of Louisville , Kentucky ? <p> He had . Of course he had . There was a river . It was near Ohio . <p> Anyway , she said , I 'm not married . I was married once , sure , but that was long ago . It did n't take . <p> The man you were with , that was n't your husband , the father of your child ? <p> She shook her head , laughing a little .

August the fifth . <p> She could be my daughter , then . <p> No , Moses . Her father was a farm boy . That summer after you left the crops was real bad , a long dry spell , and he used to come with his father in a mule-drawn wagon , they did odd jobs . A handyman , I guess you could say . <p> Yes , a handyman . <p> So they painted the church , this boy and his father . Except one day his father did n't come . He was sick .

He had a pretty singing voice , a sweet , pure tenor . <p> I could have been the father , Moses insisted . I left Knoxville in October 1907 . You might have been pregnant then . <p> It did n't happen that way , Moses , she said . That boy Elrod , he was the father of my baby girl . <p> I would have owned up to it , he said . We could have been married . <p> Elrod wanted to marry me , that poor boy . I did him a favor , way I see it , by telling him no . <p> She stiffened , moved a little away .

I travel where the Lord sends me . He had nothing to say to that . <p> Do I shock you , Moses ? <p> He was in fact shocked . <p> No , he said . Of course not . <p> You look like somebody just punched you a good one below the belt . <p> He attempted a smile . Well , he said , we might have made something of it . <p> Uh-huh , sure . Listen , Moses . That little girl was n't yours . <p> What did you name her ? <p> I did n't name her . What would have been the use of naming her ?

It was something driving me to go . <p> Oh yes , she said , withdrawing her hand . A man does what he has to do . A woman learns that much early on . <p> I did n't think , he said . I mean , I did n't imagine you 'd even notice I had gone . <p> Well , I 'll tell you what , mister . I noticed . I went looking for you . You bet I did . I walked all the way to your house and I had a nice little talk with your mother . <p> My mother ? <p> Kind of a slender pale woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you pretty well . <p> What did she say ? She 's dead , you know . <p> She was n't dead then . No sir . I guarantee you she was alive . I knew the difference even then . <p> You talked to her ? <p> She talked to me , is more like it . Told me how it was , what was what . You might be gone , she said , and you might not . You might be in that very house , hiding in some upstairs room , or you might be on the other side of the world , preaching to the heathen Chinee . It was , she gave me to understand , none of my concern . <p> My mother ? <p> I saw a definite resemblance , yes . <p> She never told me you came looking for me . <p> I wished I had n't done it . I regretted it . She made me feel low . <p> And so you took up with the gypsy boy . <p> A farm boy , he was a farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I asked you to marry me , though . I know I did . <p> Well , I guess you was n't my type , Moses . I pictured you settling down like your daddy , teaching rich kids how to play the violin . <p> She looked away . <p> Did you meet my father , too ? he asked . <p> Naw . I saw easy enough how it was from talking to your mother . <p> My father blamed you for my conversion . <p> Your conversion to what ? <p> Christianity , I think he meant . Maybe it was more than that . <p> Could n't be much more than that , could it ? <p> They fell into a period of silence-not so awkward , really . He still held her hand , and she did not seem eager to withdraw it . The air coming off the lake was cooler now . The tops of the trees on the other side were dark against the dark sky . He felt a catch in his throat . What was to be done ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not really know , had not known even when he believed himself in love with her ? A sense of unutterable sadness came over him . He thought of his mother , tried to imagine how it was for her when Rena Sue had come calling . She must have believed she was saving him . She might well have believed that she was saving him from her own fate . Her son would not be condemned to a life of captivity . Oh , Mother . Bless you and damn you . <p> Moses , Rena Sue said , I 'm not who I was then . <p> I made a mistake , he said . I made many mistakes . <p> You 'll make some more , honey . Oh yes , you will . Believe it . <p> She pulled her hand away , looked back toward the tent . <p> Now I 'm going , she said . <p> Was that shimmer in her eyes caused by tears ? Could she have been saddened by seeing him again ? He fancied pulling her to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same mistake he had in 1907 , at age eighteen . The next instant , however , he was telling himself it had been no mistake , he could not have stayed here , married her , and the only mistake he had made was in approaching her tonight . Our lives diverge , he told himself , all of our lives diverge , and there 's no backtracking , the road 's not there anymore , the only path , murky and slippery though it be , is straight ahead . <p> He heard the rustle of her white gown . She was gone . <p> A special trolley took the last of the sinners back into Knoxville . <p> They say she 's an angel , the man sitting next to Moses said . <p> I would n't put it past her , Moses said . <p> Back in his father 's house , he slept a long , deep , dreamless sleep in his childhood bed . The next morning , sunlight streaming through the broad windows of every room he entered , he resumed the sorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his calling , to estimate the worth of used goods , to save from the dust whatever was cast away or left behind . <p> He did not think of Rena Sue except fleetingly-wistful thoughts , free of undue longing-until he came again upon his father 's violins . And then it was that he saw her , saw her reflected back at him from the shining varnish of the Bergonzi , a face as beautiful and as compelling of belief as when he came up from muddy depths of the Holston River , was pronounced saved by her father , and there she stood in her long , dark dress , arms open to him , beckoning him into the dream of his life . If only , he told himself , tucking the precious fiddle beneath his chin , if only I could have turned away then . But when he began to play , tentatively at first , a scale or two , a few arpeggios , out came the Bach Chaconne , fierce , wonderful , intricate in its counterpoint of joy and grief , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's church . The sound from heaven was ringing out , chiming just as the Angel of the Airwaves had promised it would , filling his father 's house , the secret house of music , like a mighty rushing wind . <p> Truly , there was no redemption .
