Academics ruin sex . they analyze it , explain it , deconstruct it , and by the time they 're done , you wish they had stuck to talking about Kant 's Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics . So when the Museum of Sex opened in Manhattan , I should n't have been surprised that it was heavy on the museum and light on the sex . Maybe if it were called the Museum of Erotic History , I would n't have been as disappointed . But when I heard about the Museum of Sex , my mind shot right past museum and straight to the sex part . I think my past experiences at the end of the Hershey and Guinness factory tours had built unreasonable expectations . <P> In fact , the most shocking thing about the museum , besides the $17 admission , is that it exists at all : a Fifth Avenue building completely devoted to the history of sex . Patrons will be impressed by the snazzy multimedia presentations , such as an interactive computer map of early 20th century cathouses , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " madam 's " notion of submission is to keep you waiting for an hour " ) . And visitors will find the stories of Manhattan sex scandals good reading in a tabloidy , microfiche kind of way , but the exhibit can get awfully soporific , considering that it 's about sex in New York City . There 's a cover from a sixth edition of Margaret Sanger 's Family Limitation and a display of Wonder Woman comic books under the rubric of lesbian pornography , which is particularly lame when you consider that someone could have gone to Times Square and got some better examples of girl-on-girl action . Curators can be so lazy . <P> Even the good stuff is shown in that museum way that kills the fun . The items are presented in such a detached fashion , they lose all sense of purpose : a glass-encased exhibit of S &M; paraphernalia looks more like a human-rights group presentation of Syrian secret-police torture instruments from the ' 70s . The porn they do show  --  stag films from 1915 projected on a wall , videos of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into some strange National Geographic special . Even the sober-looking museum guards are n't impressed . " It 's calmer here , " says Jasmine Pallet , 22 , comparing MoSex with her previous workplace . " Yankee Stadium is wild . " <P> The collection is the result of nearly five years of effort by Daniel Gluck , who sold his software company in 1996 and used part of his money to start this project . Gluck is very eager to make sure everyone knows he has a degree in art history and is not just some smut-happy computer geek . " I was aware of this material because of my interest in the arts , " he says . " The standard computer dotcom guy would know porn sites , but that 's not where I 'm coming from . I know about it from the arts . "
