Wall Street analysts are not exactly an endangered species . But their numbers are in steep decline , and that 's great news on two levels : it 's wonderful payback for all the bogus advice many of them gave in the late ' 90s , and more important , it offers new advantages for investors who like to fish for bargains among the stocks of small companies . <P> Fewer analysts means less stock research on small companies ( market value under $1 billion ) , no matter how good the companies may be . If you know a good thing when you see it  --  say , among firms whose products and services you have used and admired  --  you have a better shot now at investing ahead of the pack . And here 's the bonus : we 're in the rising phase of the economic cycle for small companies . So if you 're not a stock picker , just put some cash in a small-cap-stock mutual fund , and let the tide lift you up . <P> Where have all the analysts gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at brokerages . Others have left out of fear that new rules barring analysts from lucrative investment-banking activity will cut deeply into their earnings potential . Just a few years ago , Citigroup had enough analysts to cover nearly 1,200 companies ; today the firm covers fewer than 800 , and most of the stocks dropped have been those of smaller firms . The number of analysts covering large companies like Cisco and eBay is rising . <P> This big-company focus is understandable . That 's where most brokerage clients have most of their stock-market money . It 's also unfortunate because small stocks tend to beat large stocks coming out of a recession . In the 12-month period following the end of each of the past 10 recessions , small stocks rose an average of 28% , vs. 19% for large stocks , according to fund company T. Rowe Price . In only one instance ( 1961 ) did large stocks beat small stocks after a recession  --  and it was by the slimmest of margins , 14% vs. 12% . <P> Why does this pattern occur ? Small companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to emerge from a global slump . Small stocks also tend to get hit hardest in a recession as investors move to the safety of blue chips , so small stocks have more room to bounce back as the recovery takes hold and investors broaden their holdings . " When you are coming out of a tough economy and off a market bottom , the cyclical recovery in earnings tends to be strongest with small caps , " says Jack Laporte , president of the T. Rowe Price New Horizons fund . Some of his favorite holdings are retailers ( Ann Taylor ) , business services ( Exult ) , software ( Jack Henry ) and semiconductors ( Maxim Integrated Products ) . <P> The pattern of small-cap outperformance appears to be holding this time around . The recession probably ended 18 months ago , and on cue , small stocks have outperformed the overall stock market since then . If you 're thinking it might be too late to buy them , it is n't . Small stocks are 20% cheaper than large stocks , based on historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small-cap research at Prudential Securities . Small-cap funds have seen inflows the past two months after outflows in March . So momentum is building , and we have not yet seen much of the typical boost from large companies ' buying small ones as the recovery gathers steam .
