" What 's your name , dear ? " the bald man with an abundance of hair sprouting from his ears inquired . " Liberty , " the young waitress replied . " What 's that ? " he said , peering at her . " Liberty , " she repeated . It 's written on my nametag , asshole . Ca n't you see it ? " What kind of name -- - " Oh , puleeze ! You got any idea how many times I 've had to go through this conversation ? Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Marlin named their baby Apple . Courteney Cox and David Arquette , Coco . What 's so unusual about Liberty ? Ignoring him , she refilled the bald man 's coffee cup and walked away . Moron ! she thought . Like who does he think he is , commenting on my name ? It 's none of his freakin ' business . When I 'm a famous singer/songwriter I wo n't question people 's names . I 'll be understanding and polite . I 'll get it . She hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so not down with this waitressin ' crap , " she complained to her cousin Cindi , who 'd gotten her the job in the Madison Avenue coffee shop and like her was an aspiring singer . " Never forget it pays the bills , girl , " said Cindi , a buxom twenty-three-year-old originally from Atlanta , with gleaming black skin , thick ankles , an ample ass , huge breasts , and a wide , inviting smile . " Singin ' should pay the bills , " Liberty said forcefully . " That 's what we do . " " When we score a gig that 's what we do , " Cindi pointed out . " So while we 're waitin ' ... " " I know , I know , " Liberty said , frowning . " Got ta make a living . Got ta pay the rent . " The furrowing of her brow did not affect her startling beauty . Bi-racial , the product of a black mother and what she assumed was amixed father -- -a man her mother refused to talk about , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long black hair , elongated green eyes , thick brows , impossibly long lashes , cut-glass cheekbones , full lips , a pointed chin , and a straight nose . Cindi was always carrying on about how Liberty looked like Halle Berry , which kind of irritated her , because she considered herself an original and did not care to be compared to anyone -- -however gorgeous and successful they might be . Liberty was nineteen . She had plenty of time . Or did she ? Sometimes she awoke in the middle of the night in a cold sweat , her heart thumping . What if she never got discovered ? What if nobody listened to her songs or heard her sing ? What if she ended up like her mom , a failed singer cleaning other people 's mess all day ? Man , she was almost twenty , she 'd been out of school four years , and nothing big had happened for her . Oh sure , she 'd made an amateur demo tape , scored a few gigs as a back-up singer , but not as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Honey , you 're it ! I 'm signing you to a contract here and now . You 'll be the next Alicia Keys or Norah Jones . All you got ta do is name it . " Where the hell were Clive Davis and Diddy when she needed them ? " Miss ! " A sharp female voice brought Liberty back to reality as an irate female customer attempted to attract her attention . She sauntered over . At least she had attitude ; nobody could take that away from her . " Yes ? " she said . " Do you know how long I 've been waiting ? " the woman demanded in a high-pitched voice . " Where are my eggs ? " Sharp-featured , the woman was wearing a knockoff Armani suit and clutching a fake Louis Vuitton purse on her lap . No style , Liberty thought . If you ca n't afford the real thing , then you may as well forget it . The man with the woman had nothing to say . Apparently his eggs were not such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty said in an " I could n't give a rat 's ass " voice . " I 'm not your table person . " She refused to say " waitress "  - -  - she found it to be demeaning -- -especially to this cow . " Well , get me my table person , ' " the woman said in a sneering voice . " I 've been sitting here for fifteen minutes . " " Sure , " Liberty drawled . For a moment their eyes met . The woman hated her because she was beautiful . It happened all the time . They would n't hate her if she was Beyonce Knowles or Janet Jackson ; they 'd be fawning all over her the way people did with stars . Once Mariah Carey had come into the coffee shop with full entourage in attendance and two massive black bodyguards who 'd never left her side . People had freaked . Paparazzi had gathered outside , and within ten minutes a huge crowd had formed -- -almost breaking the plate-glass windows . The owner of the shop , Manny Goldberg , had begun to panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prudent to escort Miss Carey and her group into the kitchen , where the star graciously sipped a cup of green tea , signed autographs , and chatted amicably with the two Hispanic chefs . Liberty had thought about approaching her but in the end chickened out . Cindi had n't . Cindi had gotten the diva 's signature on a paper napkin , which she 'd stashed in her underwear drawer along with various packets of condoms in all colors and sizes . Cindi was into being prepared . " Rude little bitch ! " Liberty heard the woman mutter to her male companion as she walked away from the table . " Who does she think she is ? " Liberty was not bothered , she 'd been called worse . She was just about to go into the back when she spotted Mr. Hip-Hop himself walking in . She held her breath for a few seconds ; this was the third time he 'd been in this week . He always sat at one of her tables and left a massive tip , although he never spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was with another man , a white man who seemed to be all business . They were talking animatedly , with a lot of arm waving going on . She knew who he was . Damon P. Donnell , hip-hop mogul supreme , head of Donnell Records . His new offices were less than a block away , and he 'd obviously picked the coffee shop as his breakfast stop-off . She knew other things about him . He was thirty-six , dark skinned , with cropped hair and a killer smile . He usually wore tinted designer shades , a diamond stud earring , Nike running shoes , and a cool suit with a silk T-shirt underneath . He was known for encouraging new talent -- -although almost all of his label consisted of male rap artists . He 'd once been a performer himself but had given it up except for the occasional charity event . He was married . Damn ! No chance of getting him that way , because Liberty drew the line at playing with married men . His wife was an Indian princess from Bombay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sixty-sixth-floor sprawling West Side penthouse with panoramic views of the city , and according to Vibe , his wife had converted three bedrooms into her own personal closet . They 'd been married two years and had no children . The first time Liberty had seen him she 'd had no idea who he was . " I think I 'm in lust ! " she 'd muttered to Cindi . " That dude is the bomb ! " Cindi , who was up on everything showbiz , soon filled her in . Cindi devoured Essence , Rolling Stone , People , Us , Star , and The National Enquirer . She watched Access , ET , Extra , and E ! every single day . " That dude is famous , married , rich , an ' way outta your reach , " Cindi had informed her . " Forget it , girl , ' cause this big boy ai n't lookin ' . " Sometimes Cindi got on her case a little too much . Her payback was an attempt to never mention him again , not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to his table , Cindi materialized and gave her a knowing nudge . " Mr. Wonderman 's back -- -again . Mebbe I was kickin ' it wrong , little cous ' , could be you do have a shot . If I was you , I 'd go for it . " " The knockoff queen at table four is screaming for her eggs , " Liberty said , ignoring any mention of Damon . " You 'd better get over there before the cow throws a shit fit . " " I 'm on it , " Cindi said , totally unconcerned . " Think I forgot to order em . Ai n't that a shame ! " Liberty approached Damon 's table . He did n't look up . " Coffee , " he said , studying the menu as if he 'd never seen it before . " Large O.J. Egg-white omelette , bacon on the side . " " I 'll have the same , " said his friend or business associate or whoever the other man was . She hesitated a moment , willing Damon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , but the other guy was sure giving her a thorough going-over with his beady little eyes . " Certainly , Mr. Donnell , " she said , making him aware that she knew who he was . " Coffee and O.J. on the way . Omelette and bacon to follow . Crispy , right ? " Finally he looked up , taking her in , his eyes -- -visible through his tinted shades -- -resting on the hand-written nametag above her right breast . But still he did n't say a word , merely gave her an imperceptible nod . She moved off to get them both coffee . And maybe her demo CD ? No ! Too soon . I 've got to develop a relationship . Like a cool waitress -- customer kind of thing . Oh yeah , now you can use the word " waitress . " That 's because he 's not some whiny white woman who thinks she 's better than me . " Waitress ! " screamed the woman in the knockoff Armani . " I 'm getting nowhere here . Where are my eggs ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old snatch where nobody 's gon na find em . " But she did n't , because Manny and Golda would n't approve and , as bosses go , they were decent people and she did n't want to get fired . Besides , she needed the job ; so did Cindi . As usual they were late on the rent , and bills were mounting . It was hard keeping up ; they could never seem to get ahead . Before working in the coffee shop Liberty had tried a variety of jobs . All horrible . Being a waitress was the best of the bunch , although it was murder on her feet . Usually she took the day shift , leaving her evenings free to write songs and hang with her musician friends , including her current boyfriend , Kev , a guitar player . She 'd been seeing Kev for a few months -- -he was a nice guy -- -but nothing serious . She did n't believe in serious , not before she 'd forged a career . " They 're on their way , " she yelled across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ! " the woman huffed , raising her painted-on eyebrows to let everyone know how pissed-off she was . " Excuse me , Liberty , " said an older regular customer sitting by himself at a corner table . " Might I get a refill ? " This one never gave her any trouble and always tipped well . She flashed him a smile and her most used words : " Coming right up . " Grabbing a pot of freshly brewed coffee from behind the counter , she filled the man 's cup , and headed for Damon 's table . Only before she could get there , a young boy playing with a toy car scooted it in front of her , and bam , she tripped over the toy , taking a fall -- -coffeepot smashing to the ground , hot liquid burning her arm , while her right ankle twisted beneath her . Silence descended while everybody turned to stare at the crash site . After a few seconds , conversation resumed , and she was left sprawled on the floor looking and feeling like a clumsy idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ; then she heard the horrible female customer laugh in a rude fashion . Quickly Liberty got herself together , even though her arm was burning from the scalding liquid and , when she tried to stand , her ankle gave way under her . Fortunately Cindi and Mr. Regular Customer came to her aid . The older man helped her to a chair , while Cindi began cleaning up the broken glass and spilled coffee . " Are you all right ? " Mr. Regular Customer asked , genuinely concerned . She nodded tearfully and shot a look across the shop to see if Damon was watching . He was n't . He was carrying on talking , gesticulating wildly , his diamond stud earring flashing against the fluorescent lights . She suppressed the urge to cry in earnest . Her arm was on fire , her ankle throbbed , and Damon P. Donnell had n't even acknowledged her existence . Was anything ever going to go right for her ? Man , she needed a break and she needed it desperately .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
