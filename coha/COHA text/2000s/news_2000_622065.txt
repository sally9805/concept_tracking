<p> AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MIDEAST PEACE <p> Editor  --  The passing of autocratic Syrian President Assad has provided ample positive opportunities for the Israelis , the Syrians and for the Middle East as a whole . The Israelis can demonstrate their genuine desire to exchange the occupied Golan Heights for security arrangements and economic cooperation with one of their most formidable neighbors . As long as Damascus , the Syrian capital , is only 25 miles away from Israel 's mighty guns , no leadership in Damascus will dare to enter into any meaningful cooperation with the Israelis . It is Israel 's turn to grasp this occasion and show the Syrians that they are genuinely willing to vacate occupied Syrian territory for a lasting peace . <p> More important , the passing of Assad is the best chance for the Syrians to rid their country of a tumultuous three-decade legacy of political oppression , isolation and economic ruin . This badly-needed and essential change can only be achieved if the new leadership in Damascus can show its people that it can retrieve their occupied land through cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East can be substantial . Assad was one of the old school of autocratic rulers who saw no value in democratization , modern education , freedom of expression or respect for human rights . His heir apparent , his son Bashar , is highly-educated in modern values , and , from all indications , he understands the importance of all the things that his father refused to acknowledge . <p> Contrary to the flood of premature negative speculations , the possibilities for realizing these objectives are better than ever , especially if the U.S. government and its oil-rich Arab allies make it attractive for the Syrians to take stock of their dilapidated economic condition . This is a golden opportunity for farsighted people to utilize . <p> ALI H. ALYAMI <p> Kensington <p> OIL COMES FIRST <p> Editor  --  Robert Bruce Ware , in his Open Forum article , " Terrorism Makes Strange Bedfellows " ( June 7 ) , makes general statements that he obviously believes are written in stone , i.e. , " globalization can not be prevented , " and , in effect , U.S. interests are unstoppable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide his true intent which is to promote U.S. oil interests throughout the world . <p> " With investment comes commitment , " Mr. Ware says . Would that the commitment were to peace , democracy and the benefit of the people in the regions with oil . The United States and the oil companies promise riches , education , etc. , but too often the people end up with a degraded landscape , widespread pollution , an oppressive government and massive national debt . <p> Unfortunately , the only thing the United States is committed to is getting " our " oil out of the hands of the infidels who have it and into our gas tanks and we do n't care whose homes , cultures or lives are destroyed in the process . <p> DANIEL STONE <p> San Francisco <p> DEATH ON THE STREETS <p> Editor  --  Sen. John Burton says it 's " anecdotal " that there are people living and dying on California 's streets because they are too ill to accept treatment voluntarily . <p> It 's not anecdotal if you have been there like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too sick to access treatment . This was not a matter of choice ; it was caused by the untreated symptoms of bipolar disorder . <p> Assemblywoman Helen Thomson is right in pursuing reform of the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act this year . Each moment that we wait , more people are dying with their civil rights on . There is nothing right about letting people live and die on California streets when they have an illness that can be treated . <p> CHARLES SOSEBEE <p> California Clients for LPS Reform <p> San Diego <p> HOME SCHOOLERS <p> Editor  --  As a supporter of public education , I am distressed to hear that the Berkeley Unified School District is harassing and threatening home schoolers , based on disputed readings of the California Education Code . <p> Even if the California Department of Education 's interpretation of the education code were correct , it would be a very bad idea to take hostile action against home schoolers . Such hostility will not succeed in attracting home schoolers ( and funding ) back to public schools . On the contrary , it will : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and very committed body of parents that public schools are The Enemy , instead of simply an organization that happens not to satisfy their needs ; <p> ( 2 ) Put the spotlight on the academic success of home schoolers , providing ammunition to opponents of public education ; and ; <p> ( 3 ) Waste scarce school district resources on lawyers and litigation . <p> Home schoolers ' academic success is a phenomenon that should be applauded rather than undermined by legal threats and harassment by officials like Alex Palau ( of BUSD Student Services ) . <p> SHEILA NEWBERY <p> Berkeley <p> PROTECTING SCHOOLKIDS <p> Editor  --  Congratulations on Stacy Finz 's in-depth research for the Flores story . Alana 's case is just the tip of the iceberg . As a retired high school administrator , I know that for every Alana who speaks up , there are hundreds of boys and girls cowering at the thought of going to school each day . Many are gay or lesbian . Many are straights targeted by bullying rat packs . Either way , the barrage of insults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . <p> " Are you gay ? , " asked by school staff is a damning question . What does it imply ? That if you are gay , you are " asking for it ? " That the safety that the law promises for every student does n't apply to you ? <p> Before children ever reach high school , homophobia is virulent . In defense of administrators , even those with new credentials , I admit they 've had small help from graduate education courses . They know cracked ribs and broken teeth prove physical assault . Few recognize the psychological wounds that push victims into quitting school . Or to that ultimate dropping-out , suicide . Almost no districts have what San Francisco has : a Kevin Gogan and a Crystal Jang who create " Safe Schools " curricula starting where it must start to cure homophobia , in the primary grades . <p> Because the Flores case predated AB 537 , the Student Safety and Violence Prevention Act , Alana 's lawyer must struggle against ambiguous regulations . But since January 1 , California 's Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including lesbians , gays , or students so perceived . We members of the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network are dedicated to awakening local communities to that fact . <p> BEN STEFFENS <p> Half Moon Bay <p> EMBARCADERO BARRIER <p> Editor  --  Unfortunately , the city did n't plan too well in the rejuvenation of the Ferry Building . If you have been down to the area , you need to cross six lanes of heavy traffic and two Muni track beds to get to the building . The old problem with the double-decker highway was that the Ferry Building was cut off from the city . The new problem is that the building is cut off from the city . <p> Few will be enticed to casually stroll to the building for shopping or a quick lunch . Psychologically , six lanes of traffic seems a burden to cross . And sitting outdoors watching traffic pass after is not your ideal lunch time well spent . Let 's face it , we will have to wait 50 more years until they realize that the road should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have created a great vast city plaza that could have been used for many functions . It would have expanded Justin Herman Plaza and made one of the best city public spaces around . It saddens me to think how the lack of vision has translated to a lost opportunity . Is it too late ? <p> JOHN HESSE <p> San Francisco <p> WHARF CRITIQUE <p> Editor  --  Your June 12 editorial about Pier 45 is right on target . We have had a family business across the street from Pier 45 for over 60 years and have watched the city allow " open-air " T-shirt shops and fast-food outlets proliferate . We do n't need more of that on the pier . You can barely walk down Taylor or Jefferson streets anymore without bumping into racks of sweatshirts and postcards blocking half the sidewalk  --  and most of the shops have no public rest rooms . Sidewalk zoning regulations are not enforced . <p> Planners need to start paying attention and improve the appearance of our area instead of fearing it as a " political hot potato . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unobstructed sidewalks so locals and visitors can enjoy the natural beauty of the wharf . This can only enhance local businesses in the future . City planners should visit Sydney , Australia , to see what a beautiful job they 've done combining activities for visitors and locals alike along their waterfront ! <p> ANTONE SABELLA <p> A.
