Hoovestol , 47 ; former West University Place Mayor Teresa W. Fogler , 47 ; and energy company manager Tom Pielech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for flood mitigation , working to protect green spaces such as the Rice Pocket Park and preserving zoning laws . <p> " I 've also devoted time to ensuring that public business is conducted in the public eye with residents ' participation , " said Griffin , who has lived in West University Place for nine years . " I was also instrumental in increasing the staffing of our fire department to ensure our safety and theirs . " <p> Issues facing the next City Council , she said , include managing the infrastructure program , dealing with flooding issues , continuing to improve fire safety , mitigating train noise and holding down the city budget . <p> " We can not incur any more debt , " Griffin said . <p> Ballanfant counts improvement of the city 's fire protection rating , accelerating the infrastructure program and passing a $ 5.1 million sidewalk bond issue as successes during his term on City Council . <p> " Speeding up the infrastructure has caused some discomfort , but there are areas of the city that are now finished that would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in West University Place for 28 years . " At the time , it was becoming apparent that sewers were failing quicker than we could get to them . An ancillary benefit is that we brought most of the debt on at the lowest interest rates . " <p> Now that the sidewalk program has begun , he said , the city needs to move forward on a plan for new pedestrian lighting . <p> Another important issue is identifying potential park land in underserved areas of the city , Ballanfant said . <p> Woods , who has lived in West University Place for 22 years , said he wants to see the city 's " hometown atmosphere " perpetuated . <p> " We need some consensus-building rather than squabbling over individual interests , " said Woods , who listed the city budget , flooding problems and public safety as important issues . <p> " I 'd like to see us continue at a good pace on improvements such as the infrastructure , sidewalks and the recreation center , but not at the expense of overburdening the budget , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years ago , Kaplan was active in Missouri City , where he served as president of the local municipal utility district . <p> " I 've always been involved where I live and I believe I understand the issues here in the city , " Kaplan said . " The budget will be very challenging and I think I can help out with that . " <p> Streets , sidewalks , streetlights , flooding , traffic management , public safety and privatizing some city services are important issues , Kaplan said . <p> Albin , a resident for 20 years , has served on either the Building and Standards Board or the Zoning and Planning Commission for the past 10 years . He was one of the authors of the " 80 percent " rule that governs building space on a lot . <p> " West U. has always been about quality versus quantity , " Albin said . " On issues , fiscal responsibility is a must right now in the midst of redoing our infrastructure . There are a lot of things that would be nice to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Albin said his background in construction would be helpful in dealing with infrastructure and sidewalk issues . <p> Farley , a six-year resident , said he is concerned about the city 's debt . <p> " The biggest issue is to refrain from embarking on another capital improvement project . We have the infrastructure program , the sidewalk bond issue and bringing on the new recreation center . And we need to do something about drainage , " he said . " We do n't have the financial wherewithal to do anything else . " <p> Important issues , Farley said , include addressing train noise and holding down operating costs . He believes the city does n't have the money right now for new streetlights . <p> Klutts , a retired city of Houston firefighter who has lived in West University Place for 13 years , said public safety issues are his biggest concern . <p> " People live here because of safety and security , " he said . " We 're going to be looking at hiring a new police chief , a new fire chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot on our plate . " <p> Addressing drainage problems should also be a priority he said , along with servicing the debt . <p> " We need to take a deep breath and step back and realize that every single dollar that comes in does n't have to go out , " Klutts said . <p> Segal , chairman of the Zoning Board of Adjustment , has lived in the city the longest of any candidate - for 31 years . <p> Rising taxes , sidewalk construction and the budget are among issues he believes are most important . His background as a tax and regulation attorney will be helpful , Segal said . <p> " I 'm also looking at zoning as an issue because of the myriad of ever-changing rules , " Segal said . " I 'd like to see some stability in the process where we can say this is what we want and it will last for awhile . " <p> Hoovestol , who has lived in West University Place for eight years , said he believes there are three top priorities for the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . <p> " The problem is that the budget is very high because of infrastructure debt . There are a lot of things that we ca n't change to lower taxes but we have to watch everything carefully , " Hoovestol said . <p> Among important capital improvements is flooding mitigation and funding the new recreation center , Hoovestol said . Quality of life issues include train noise , building standards and safety . <p> Fogler , who has lived in West University Place for 20 years , has the most experience of any candidate after serving as a councilwoman from 1993 to 1997 and as mayor from 1997 to 1999 . <p> She considers the budget , drainage , the sidewalk program , the " 80 percent rule " and side setbacks as among the biggest issues . <p> " Drainage is critical . I was on the Council that passed the bond issue and one of the things we touted is that drainage would be improved and that has n't happened for some people , " Fogler said . " Figuring out what to do with the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart . " <p> Fogler said finding a way to phase in improvements to the recreation center will be important in order to avoid incurring more debt . While she likes the idea of streetlights , she does n't think the city can afford them in the near future . <p> Pielech , a resident for six years , said he decided to run for office to focus the city 's attention on what he believes are the priorities . <p> " The city should provide the best police , fire and public works departments that we can , " said Pielech , who is not in favor of privatizing city services . " We also need to complete the infrastructure projects and look at flooding and drainage in a cooperative manner with other cities and the county . " <p> Hiring a new police chief , cracking down on speeding and fire safety are also important issues , Pielech said . <p> TYPE : Biography
