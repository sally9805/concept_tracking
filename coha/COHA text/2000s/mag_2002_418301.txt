FOR INC 500 CEOS , THE BOTTOM LINE IS GROWING  --  BUT SO IS THE ANXIETY . HOW LONG CAN SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES FIGHT A TROUBLED ECONOMY ? <p> You could call Bill Oesterle a member of the worried well . And he 's got company : many of the 270 other chief executives of Inc 500 companies who answered a recent survey about the entrepreneurial economy . Most of this crew have seen healthy growth at their businesses this year . They expect to do even better next year . But their outlook hardly counts as blind entrepreneurial optimism ; indeed , most seem to be watching today 's economic and political news and nervously shuddering . In what could be a summation of the group 's ambivalent sentiments ; Oesterle , CEO of the Indianapolis company Angie 's List , wrote , " Things are going very well for us , but we are very cautious with expenses and very conscious of the companies around us that are not as fortunate . There but for the grace of God go we .... " <p> On the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 CEOs would seem to have little to worry about . Sales at Angie 's List  --  Oesterle describes it as a Consumer Reports about service companies  --  should grow more than 68% this year , to $4.2 million . Profits are up , too , and Oesterle thinks that next year will be just as good . So it is with other survey respondents . About 7 out of 10 say that this year 's revenues will be up over last year 's , with many foreseeing a better-than-20% boost . Nearly as many expect this year 's profits to grow , too , and almost 9 out of 10 expect both sales and profits to rise next year . As for job cuts , the worst in this sector may be over . Although about one-third of respondents said they had laid off employees this year , only a few plan layoffs for the first quarter of next year . The vast majority expect to expand their payrolls . <p> Nor is it just the Inc 500 companies that are doing well ; the positive picture seems to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 402 fast-growing companies surveyed by Pricewaterhouse-Coopers ( PWC ) in September said they remained confident that their own companies ' sales would continue to grow  --  by 13% this year , about the same annual growth rate that they had predicted in a second-quarter survey . Add to that some good news from Arc Analytics president David Birch , the researcher who created and maintains the " gazelle " database , which consists of entrepreneurial companies that grow at least 20% annually for four straight years . Last December , Inc reported that the population of gazelles had for the first time declined . Birch was both surprised and alarmed ; he had never seen a decline in that group , he pointed out , and maybe we could n't expect gazelles to help pull us out of the recession this time around . But today the decline has reversed itself , and the gazelle population is up by 23% . <p> Though the numbers look good , few of the CEOs surveyed by Inc or PWC act as if they 've just received a clean bill of health . Greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the CEOs surveyed by PWC are only cautiously hiring and spending . ( PWC notes that , not surprisingly , that very caution is likely to prolong the economic slowdown . ) The skittish Oesterle , for instance , has created cost-cutting contingency plans , even putting his $2-million advertising budget into the mix of items that could be trimmed . And this year  --  his seventh in business and his best yet  --  is the first in which Angie 's List wo n't open any new markets . ( The company operates in 13 cities , and its business is local to each metropolitan area . ) " We just do not want to get hung out with extra burn in case something were to go wrong , " Oesterle says . " Maybe we 're being too afraid of our own shadow here , but it just seems like things are going well , so let 's not muck it up . " <p> Other survey respondents sound a similarly conservative note . Some say they 'll operate with leaner staffs than in years past . Others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO of Bennett &; Curran Inc. , a $2.5-million wholesale distributor of books in Englewood , Colo. , says , " I do n't want anything purchased by anyone in our company unless it has to do with driving our business forward . " Stephenson , whose sales were flat this year , has shrunk spending on everything from magazine subscriptions to Internet costs to shipping . He has even reduced his own compensation and that of his two management-level employees by 15% . <p> Look more deeply at the survey responses and other data , and you can see some of what 's behind the worries : Although 7 out of 10 CEOs in the most recent survey forecasted revenue growth this year , that 's slightly fewer than the previous quarterly survey showed . If a true recovery had taken hold , that number would have increased . <p> The macroeconomic signs look threatening . After indications of an impending recovery midyear , the economy " hit an air pocket " in September , says Mark Zandi , chief economist at the research company Economy.com Inc . That did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're still in a recession , and 78% fear a looming slowdown in consumer spending . What 's more , three-quarters of those who feel we 're in a recession call it moderate to severe  --  up from about half in our last survey . <p> Moreover , the microeconomic signs seem portentous . Insurance costs are rising . ( See " Cost Cutting II " section , on page 104 . ) It 's hard to find new customers and new capital . Smart CEOs keep an eye on their own markets  --  and many are n't liking what they see . Oesterle , for instance , watches the sales at Lowe 's and Wal-Mart stores ; when their sales are up , so are his , and both had been doing exceptionally well for the past two years . But " watching Wal-Mart miss their sales expectations this quarter makes me uneasy , " he says . He also tracks the economy by following the activity of 100,000 service providers  --  plumbers , carpenters , and so forth  --  who advertise with his company . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had 13-week backlogs for 10 years said , ' We 're looking for work , ' " says Oesterle , revealing yet another sign of an impending consumer-spending downturn . <p> And confidence is n't exactly high . A brutal stock market . CEOs in handcuffs . A dicey situation in Iraq . The perception that things are bad all over is part of a vicious cycle : as the perception grows , confidence wanes , and as confidence wanes , the perception grows . Says Zandi : " The prospects that this recovery is going to evolve into a more sustained expansion seem poorer and poorer . Investor , business , and consumer confidence  --  every one has grown increasingly dark . " <p> So there you have it : the worried well , facing a situation that is n't too bad but is n't exactly hunky-dory , either . Which raises the question , How do you manage a fast-growth company in confusing times like these ? <p> Some answers from the Inc 500 : Trim costs ( including that biggest one of all , health insurance )  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , oh yes : jump on the opportunities that a recession provides . There are more than you 'd expect . Cost cutting I : The scalpel , not the meat-ax <p> It was Mark Comiso 's gloomiest moment . His San Francisco-based interactive marketing agency , Maus Haus Inc. , was down from a high of 50 employees to 8 . Short on revenues , the company had high fixed costs , including rent for office space , furniture , and computers . But Comiso refused to give up . " I told my partner , ' We ca n't go out of business  --  we would n't find a job ! ' " <p> Instead , Comiso slashed his expenses , just as almost one-third of our survey respondents are planning to do next year . But he did so with a rapier , not a bludgeon . <p> At Maus Haus , the most important choices centered on the staff . With his revenues dropping from $2.6 million in 2000 to $2.3 million last year and even less in 2002 , Comiso knew he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of senior staffers . " A lot of companies went right at the top  --  they cut senior designers and senior programmers because they get the biggest salaries . But you wind up with a dichotomy : you sell with the A team  --  the partners  --  and deliver with the B team . " To make the finances work , he asked the remaining employees to work half-time for half pay , and he and his partner took 75% salary cuts . In return , he encouraged the new half-timers to freelance on the side . That arrangement lasted for about six months , until last spring , when the market picked up . Today all the staffers  --  now 14 people  --  work full-time . <p> Shrink expenses too far , of course , and you deprive a company of its lifeblood . Like almost half of the CEOs who responded to the survey , Comiso is now carefully growing his marketing budget . His goal : to keep $1 million worth of potential business in the pipeline at any one time . He 's upgrading the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales piece , and producing direct-mail promotional material . Although Comiso wo n't hire new in-house salespeople , he may recruit commission-only sales help from the vast quantity of laid-off advertising professionals . <p> For Comiso , saving pricier employees was the right choice . " When we did get clients , we were still able to deliver , and that has allowed us to come through this forest fire and survive , " he says . Now it 's time to invest again . " We still have to get our name out there and create brand awareness . " Cost cutting II : Reining in health care <p> Health insurance : it can make you sick . Nearly all our survey respondents are concerned about today 's rise in rates ; about 60% report that they 're " greatly concerned . " How much do they think rates will go up ? More than 70% of the CEOs surveyed expect total insurance costs ( including health , vehicle , and workers ' compensation insurance ) to rise 10% to 25% in 2003 . Another 20% of respondents expect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , the increases have already begun . Take Legacy Financial Group Inc. , a $6.9-million mortgage-services company based in Arlington , Tex . Legacy 's health-care costs are more than twice what they were only three years ago . The company 's 2002 premiums are up 50% . Anticipating an increase of another 40% for 2003 , CEO Chad Bates decided radical measures were in order . <p> One step was to increase the portion paid by employees , a common tactic . But given the competition for good people in the red-hot mortgage industry , Legacy had to absorb most of the increased costs itself . " Because of lower mortgage rates , business has been brisk , " says Bates . " So we have to provide benefit programs that can compete with those at larger banking institutions , or we lose key employees . " <p> So , like 60% of our survey respondents , Bates has been searching out lower-cost alternatives to his company 's present coverage . This year he and his wife , Joy , who is Legacy 's controller and human-resources director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Insurance Co.  --  which happened to be a client of Legacy 's D.C. office  --  submitted a quote significantly lower than those of the competition and ultimately enabled the Bateses to keep costs flat for employee-only coverage , while employee-and-family coverage actually decreased 13% . <p> Of course , the process was not without costs , particularly the three months that Chad and Joy spent researching and soliciting bids . But Chad plans to repeat the bidding process every year . " We 're leaving money on the table if we do n't , " he says . " We 've been in business more than 10 years and only changed carriers twice up until this past year . Now we 're going to have to keep changing . " Tune up now for growth later <p> With parts of the economy in a morass , many workers ' spirits  --  and energy  --  are also in a trough . About a third of our respondents said that " keeping employees motivated and focused " had become more difficult . So they are tuning up their companies and improving performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just ask John Metzger and James Clark , CEO and chief operating officer , respectively , of the Boulder , Colo. , public-relations firm Metzger Associates . The company was flush in 2000 . But by 2001 , as its high-tech clients began bleeding , revenues dropped from $3.5 million to $3.3 million , and the company lost money . Trying to choose which of several valuable employees to lay off , Clark and Metzger realized they had to decide on gut instinct . They had poor systems for tracking critical information and performing employee reviews , and they had only handshakes and paid bills as proof of client satisfaction . In the fall of 2001 they started developing a balanced-scorecard effort , a new performance-evaluation process , and a quality-assurance program , which they rolled out over the past year . <p> This year the company expects revenues of about $4 million . Although they 're operating on thin margins , Metzger and Clark believe investing in those programs will pay off quickly with happier employees , increased revenues , and , by 2004 , 15.5% profit margins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We want to be a creative company , " says Clark . " Reactive companies let all of the external factors impact their processes . Creative companies look internally and say , ' Let 's take a look at our situation . How can we improve upon that ? ' " <p> Like Clark and Metzger , Matthew Ohrnstein is proactive in down times . The CEO of Caliber Collision Centers , a $220-million chain of 68 repair shops in California and Texas , Ohrnstein is rolling out a 6- to 18-month development program for his store managers in hopes of readying them for even greater growth and profitability when the economy picks up . <p> For Ohrnstein , improving employee performance is all-important . " At any point , we have 20 stores firing on all cylinders , 35 that are acceptable , and the rest at some level of remediation , " he says . " If you could just pull up the ones that are average to be excellent , and the ones that are acceptable to be average , that has an impact on customer satisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opportunity knocks  --  if you 're home <p> John McMillan , an engineer-turned-CEO , is a low-key kind of guy . You ca n't help liking him , but you 'd love to hate him , because McMillan , CEO of Wise Solutions Inc. , a software company in Plymouth , Mich. , is a glutton at the feast of opportunities served up by the recession . His company has grown by an average of 42% annually in each of the past six years , with typical profit margins of 25% and no debt . This year McMillan hired 30 employees , jamming his offices with 100 people . No problem . " We moved into a larger building during this downtime , " he says . " The lease we got was awesome . " <p> Not envious yet ? Try this : McMillan bought mahogany furniture for 5 on the dollar . More strategically , he 's increasing spending on research and development and is looking for acquisitions . " In this market , you try to increase market share , because other companies are n't in the mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonsensical that you wonder why everyone does n't chase opportunities in a slowdown . So does McMillan . He thinks most executives are paralyzed by the same kind of anxiety that incites investors to sell stocks when prices are low . " This is the time you think company owners should be realizing that their competitors are distracted , worried , not working hard . But somehow they do n't think that way . " <p> Bill Oesterle , CEO of Angie 's List , is another one who does . He negotiated a 15% discount on $2 million worth of advertising and 12% off the cost of printing 100,000 publications a month . <p> What does it take to turn a recession to your advantage ? A debt-free company with decent cash flow helps . But the right attitude may be more important . " One person sees a brick wall , " says McMillan . " And I go , ' What can I do with that ? Can I market that brick wall ? ' " SLOWDOWN ? WHAT SLOWDOWN ? <p> Everybody 's worried , right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their companies , nearly a quarter of Inc 500 survey respondents checked the box that said " Fantastic ... we 're going great guns . " Explain that if you can . <p> Part of the explanation lies in the overall economy , which itself is sharply fragmented by industry . Health care is doing well . So are educational services , along with mortgage banking and everything else related to housing . " But , " says economist Mark Zandi of Economy.com , " that 's it . If anyone else is telling you the world is good , its because they 're taking market share from some behemoth . " <p> And maybe that 's the rest of the explanation . Take Topics Entertainment , which publishes educational and reference software , such as World Book encyclopedias and Rand McNally maps . CEO Greg James says that retailers like Best Buy and Circuit City have made Topics their vendor of choice , so his success has come at the expense of other software companies . Thanks to such market swiping , James expects Topics to grow from $22 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For this project Inc teamed with Inquisite , the survey product group of Catapult Systems , an Inc 500 company .
