Prologue On May 22 , 1998 , the San Francisco Giants arrived in St. Louis for a three-game series with the Cardinals . That weekend , Giants All-Star left fielder Barry Bonds got a firsthand look at the frenzied excitement surrounding Mark McGwire , baseball 's emerging Home Run King . // Bonds had recently remarried , but on this trip he was accompanied by his girlfriend , Kimberly Bell , a slender , attractive woman with long brown hair and green eyes whom he had met four years earlier in the players ' parking lot at Candlestick Park . Bell had been looking forward to the trip , and it was pleasant in many ways-a big hotel room with a view of St. Louis 's famous arch ; a wonderful seat eight rows behind home plate ; and even tornado warnings , which were exotic to a California girl . But Bonds was sulky and brooding . A three-time winner of the National League Most Valuable Player award , he was one of the most prideful stars in baseball . All that weekend , though , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern game , the Cardinals ' first baseman was a player of exceptional size and power . That summer the 6-foot-5 McGwire weighed 260 muscular pounds and was hitting balls that traveled in long , soaring arcs . The season was less than two months old , but he already had hit 20 home runs . McGwire 's pace was ahead of Babe Ruth 's when he hit 60 home runs in 1927 , and also ahead of Roger Maris 's when he hit 61 to break Ruth 's record in 1961 . Players , fans , and the media were already anticipating that McGwire could break baseball 's most storied record , and the noisy attention he received as a result was impossible to ignore . // Before Friday night 's game , even the Giants ' coaches acted like fans , gathering behind the batting cage and watching as McGwire hit 10 batting practice pitches into the stands . During the game itself , McGwire crushed a home run into an area of Busch Stadium 's upper deck called " Big Mac Land . " The home run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free hamburger . For the Giants , Bonds went 1 for 4 with a double . The Cardinals won 4-3. // On Saturday night , McGwire singled in the first inning and scored from second when Bonds made a poor throw on a hit to left field . Then McGwire hit two more home runs , the second one bouncing off the Chevrolet sign on the left-field scoreboard . The Cards won 11-10. // On Sunday , Bonds himself hit a dramatic two-run homer , his 11th of the season , to tie the game in the 9th inning . But in the 12th , after the Giants had pulled ahead 6-4 , McGwire hit an equally dramatic shot to tie the game again . It was his fourth home run of the series , and his 24th of the young season . The Giants finally won in 17 , but Bonds 's mood remained irretrievably foul . // On that trip , Bonds began making racial remarks about McGwire to Kimberly Bell . According to Bell , he would repeat them throughout the summer , as McGwire and Sammy Sosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hitting home runs at an amazing rate , became the talk of the nation . // " They 're just letting him do it because he 's a white boy , " Bonds said of McGwire and his chase of Maris 's record . The pursuit by Sosa , a Latin player from the Dominican Republic , was entertaining but doomed , Bonds declared . As a matter of policy , " They 'll never let him win , " he said . // As he sometimes did when he was in a particularly bleak mood , Bonds was channeling racial attitudes picked up from his father , the former Giants ' star Bobby Bonds , and his godfather , the great Willie Mays , both African-American ballplayers who had experienced virulent racism while starting their professional careers in the Jim Crow South . Barry Bonds himself had never seen anything remotely like that : He had grown up in an affluent white suburb on the San Francisco Peninsula , and his best boyhood friend , his first wife , and his present girlfriend all were white . When Bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they " were , or how the supposed conspiracy to rig the home run record was being carried out . But his brooding anger was real enough , and it continued throughout a year in which he batted .303 , hit 37 home runs , made the All-Star team for the eighth time , and was almost completely ignored . For , as the 1998 season unfolded , the attention of all baseball focused on McGwire 's home run chase and on his gentlemanly rivalry with Sosa . The quest to hit 61 home runs transfixed even casual fans , in the way that a great pennant race used to do in the old days . // Something about McGwire 's appearance-the red hair and the freckled , craggy face that sometimes burst into a winning smile-seemed to invite affectionate hyperbole . The sportswriters who covered him wrote that McGwire had Popeye 's forearms and shoulders as broad as Paul Bunyan 's . The nature of his quest also was expressed in hyperbolic terms . McGwire 's home run chase was " a metaphor for the best in America , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chase as a cultural phenomenon . It was more significant than " the ascent on Mt . Everest , " as San Francisco Giants ' marketing man Pat Gallagher proclaimed . And from acting baseball commissioner Bud Selig down to its ordinary fans-anybody who cared about the game and worried about its future-all agreed that McGwire 's pursuit of the home run record was hugely important . It had made watching the sport of baseball enjoyable again , for the first time in quite a while . // Baseball 's fans are among the most forgiving in all sports , but the toxic relations between team owners and the players union had put the fans ' patience to the test for a generation . From 1971 through 1990 , seven baseball seasons had been interrupted by labor disputes . The eighth interruption , which began in August 1994 , lasted 234 days and led to the cancellation of the World Series for the only time since World War I. It also nearly killed the game . // As always , both the union and the owners claimed the dispute was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another fight about money . For fans , the dispute was dispiriting and pointless , an argument between millionaires and billionaires. // The owners finally reopened the ballparks , and the players slunk back into them two weeks after the 1995 season had been scheduled to start . In park after park they were greeted with a cascade of boos . Many fans just stayed away . Attendance in 1995 was down 28 percent , nearly 20 million , from 1993 , the last pre-strike season . It crept back in the following seasons , but in 1997 , attendance was still down 10 percent , or more than 7 million fans , from the pre-strike high . By some estimates the lockout had cost the owners $500 million in lost revenues in 1994 , and $800 million more in 1995 . More worrisome still were the many signs that interest in the game might have permanently ebbed. // Then , in 1998 , McGwire 's assault on Maris 's record brought the fans back to baseball in droves . The Cardinals ' home attendance , which had languished since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other National League clubs saw big gains as well . For fans , McGwire 's escalating home run totals became a daily reminder of the game 's underlying drama and intensity-and its history , for the ghost of Ruth hovered about all summer long . And if McGwire 's chase of the home run record evoked baseball 's past , Sosa was a charming connection to its future , one of a stream of talented Latin players who were flooding into the game . Fans were drawn to Sosa , McGwire 's friendly rival , and the complex ritual he went through each time he crossed home plate after a homer , including the blown kiss and the tap of his heart to honor his mother . // By mid-summer the home run chase took on a traveling circus atmosphere . One night in Phoenix , 25,000 people showed up to watch McGwire take his hacks in batting practice , while a TV station provided pitch-by-pitch commentary and the scoreboard registered the distance of each practice home run . A media pack worthy of a presidential candidate on election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word and action . // In August , when McGwire had already hit 43 bombs , a veteran Associated Press writer named Steve Wilstein stopped by the big Cardinal 's locker in Busch Stadium . As he waited for McGwire to emerge from the shower , Wilstein noted items in plain view on a locker shelf : a photo of McGwire with his 10-year-old son ; a can of Popeye-brand Spinach ; a bottle of a product called androstenedione . Wilstein assumed it was some sort of vitamin . // But Andro was more than that . The product was a testosterone booster marketed by Patrick Arnold , a renegade chemist who was pioneering the development of steroids that would be undetectable by the most sophisticated laboratory tests . Andro was legal . But it had been banned by the International Olympic Committee , the National Collegiate Athletic Association , and the National Football League . Olympic doping experts told Wilstein that Andro had the same muscle-building effects as anabolic steroids , which Congress had outlawed in 1991 . Andro was a steroid by another name . In the Olympics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were banned . // Baseball , however , had no rules against steroid use , and a different attitude about cheating . From corking bats to doctoring balls to hiding a coach with binoculars in the scoreboard to steal signs , the impulse to cut corners was almost as old as the game itself . Players did what they could to get an edge , without shame or serious consequence . Performance-enhancing drugs had become another way to accomplish that . For decades , the game 's drug of choice was not steroids but " greenies , " or amphetamines , which were popped by players seeking to kick their performance up a notch , hoping to overcome fatigue , aches and pains , hangovers , even boredom . // Perhaps because of the sport 's antipathy to weight lifting , steroids were slow to catch on . For much of the game 's history , players were discouraged from pumping iron , lest they lose the flexibility and quick wrists needed to get around on the pitched ball . // That began to change in the mid-to-late 1980s . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the big leagues was the Cuban slugger Jose Canseco , the first player to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season . Canseco also was McGwire 's teammate on the dominating Oakland Athletics clubs of the 1980s . In 2005 , out of baseball , financially strapped , and on probation for assault , Canseco would write a confessional memoir , claiming to have " single handedly changed the game of baseball " by popularizing weight training and performance-enhancing drugs . Canseco said his own career proved that strength conditioning , when combined with steroids and human growth hormone , translated into a higher batting average and more power . He claimed that the drugs could transform a good player into a great one . After his Rookie of the Year season in 1985 , when he hit 33 home runs , Canseco claimed other players began to emulate him , and weight training and juicing swept the game . // In the book 's most enduring image , Canseco described going into the bathroom at the Oakland Coliseum with McGwire before A 's games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inject themselves with the steroid Deca-Durabolin , then take the field . // But in 1998 , Canseco 's disclosures about his famous teammate were far in the unanticipated future . And in 1998 , McGwire had been caught only with Andro , not with Growth or Deca . Still , the AP 's revelation that McGwire was using a drug that would have gotten him banned from the Olympic Games pushed its way into the headlines . Many in baseball 's establishment reacted with outrage-not at McGwire , but at Wilstein , the writer who broke the story . // Leading the attack was Tony La Russa , the Cardinals ' tightly wound manager . He lashed out at the media , agitating to ban the Associated Press from the Cards ' clubhouse on the spurious grounds that Wilstein had violated an unwritten baseball rule by looking in McGwire 's locker. // Acting commissioner Selig promised baseball would commission a scientific study about the health effects of performance-enhancing drugs . But he made clear he would take no action regarding McGwire and Andro. // Selig 's deepest fear was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin McGwire and kill baseball 's lucrative Renaissance just as it was beginning . Fans loved the long ball ; crowds were packing the parks ; the rancor of the strike was being forgotten ; McGwire and Sosa were bringing baseball back from oblivion 's edge . And if it sometimes seemed that baseball was devolving into an arcade game , with double-digit scores resembling those in football , and if players were showing up at spring training 15 pounds heavier and displaying the physiques of bodybuilders , those were concerns for another time . // Soon , the Andro story faded . Stubborn pitchers continued to challenge McGwire , and he continued to drive the ball . The rate at which he hit homers was unprecedented-once every 7.27 at bats , far above Ruth 's career average of 11.76-and the distances they traveled inspired awe . At Busch Stadium , where the center field fence was 402 feet from home plate , he hit a 545-foot shot that slammed into a seat in the second deck . The club marked the spot by painting a big picture of a Band-Aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver sailed out of Coors Field , bounced through the players ' parking lot , and finally came to rest against a fence 700 feet from the plate . // McGwire hit number 62 on September 8 in St. Louis , amidst a wild celebration and before a national TV audience , and then continued hitting bombs : five of them in his final 11 at bats , including two on the last day of the season , to finish with 70 , four ahead of Sosa . In 36 seasons , no baseball player had topped the 60 home run mark-and now two players had blown past it in the same year . Many at the time said McGwire 's 1998 season was the greatest offensive performance in the history of the sport . // On the West Coast , Barry Bonds was astounded and aggrieved by the outpouring of hero worship for McGwire , a hitter whom he regarded as obviously inferior to himself . Bonds was 33 years old , had played in the big leagues for 12 years , and was known for an unusual combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Giants , Bonds had signed what was then the richest contract in the game : $43.75 million for six years . In 1996 he had become the second player in history , after Canseco , to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season . Bonds knew he was on his way to the Hall of Fame . For as long as he had played baseball , Bonds had regarded himself as better than every other player he encountered , and almost always he was right . // But as the 1998 season ended , Bonds 's elite status had slipped a notch . The game and its fans were less interested in the complete player who could hit for average and power , and who had great speed and an excellent glove . The emphasis was shifting to pure slugging . From now on , the biggest contracts and the most adulation would go to big , muscular players who could put up home run numbers unlike anything the game had ever seen : players like Mark McGwire . As McGwire 's pursuit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's media , and as McGwire was celebrated as the best slugger of the modern era and perhaps the greatest slugger who had ever lived , Bonds became more jealous than people who knew him well had ever seen . // To Bonds , it was a joke . He had been around enough gyms to recognize that McGwire was a juicer . Bonds himself had never used anything more performance enhancing than a protein shake from the health-food store . But as the 1998 season unfolded , and as he watched Mark McGwire take over the game-his game-Barry Bonds decided that he , too , would begin using what he called " the shit . " //
