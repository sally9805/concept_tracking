For nearly 30 years , independent insurance agency owner Bob McAfee of Massillon , Ohio , earned free vacations for himself and his wife by hitting sales goals set by his larger underwriters . <p> The trips were used to reward his agency 's top salesmen , and improve his business . He views the all-expense-paid vacations to Switzerland , Mexico , England and Hawaii as a key motivator and part of compensation . <p> " It was really great for my salespeople , " who earn around $75,000 to $125,000 a year , McAfee says . " They really did try to write the necessary new business to qualify for these trips . " <p> But with the down economy and ongoing public backlash against excessive spending by corporate giants , the lavish incentive trip  --  and , increasingly , even once-routine meetings and conferences  --  are in trouble . Bailout recipients AIG , Wells Fargo , Chrysler and General Motors all scrapped most 2009 incentive trips , behavior that 's increasingly influencing healthy companies . <p> They 're reacting to media coverage of extravagant incentive trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . Rep. Elijah Cummings , D-Md. , has been a vocal critic of bailed-out companies spending money on lavish gatherings at a time of rising joblessness and home foreclosures . <p> " Some of this stuff is just common sense , " he says . " You ca n't have one hand out begging for money and the next thing you do is go on some junket , when the people whose money you 're using are losing their homes . " <p> The problem is that all types of corporate gatherings are being labeled " junkets , " and companies are cutting back to avoid getting a bad rap , travel leaders say . The mood is even affecting hotel bookings for the Kentucky Derby , which often attracts corporations and their clients , says Karen Williams of the Louisville Convention and Visitors Bureau . <p> Incentive trips , meetings and events account for 15% of all travel spending , which creates 2.4 million jobs , $240 billion in spending and $39 billion in tax revenue , according to the U.S. Travel Association . Incentive trips  --  generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  alone generate about $13 billion a year , according to the Incentive Research Foundation . Motivational meetings and special events generate $64 billion a year . <p> Paul Hebert , whose firm i2i helps companies devise motivational strategies , expects incentive travel programs will return around 2011 , once scrutiny subsides , but , " The days of having Celine Dion singing at your final night banquet may be over . " <p> The deeper impact will affect the larger category of executive brainstorming meetings and other retreats that are often held at luxury hotels , he says . <p> Trips have said thanks to many <p> Since the days of the traveling salesman , companies have rewarded top performers with extras to recognize their hard work and thank spouses who put up with their long hours . <p> The trips are n't just for six-figure salespeople , says Brenda Anderson , CEO of Site ( formerly the Society of Incentive &amp; Travel Executives ) . <p> For example , Ford Motor rewarded dealership mechanics who finished master technician training by sending them to Marriott 's CasaMagna resort in Cancun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dealers paid for the training , but Ford paid the vacation tab , he says . <p> Some incentive trips are first-class affairs in exotic places such as Hong Kong , a mega-resort in Mexico or a beautiful hotel in Hawaii so they 'll be memorable and motivational , says Mike Fegley , a senior executive with InterContinental Hotels . <p> The industry even has awards  --  Site 's Crystal Awards  --  to recognize standout trips . An IBM event won last year for a Beatlemania beach party in Bermuda , where 1,800 top achievers and their guests found the beach at the luxury Fairmont Southampton transformed into a psychedelic dream world , with 80 lit daisies up to 18 feet tall planted in the sand , a Beatles tribute band and fireworks timed to Hey Jude . <p> Today , the climate for such elaborate trips has changed . IBM this spring is giving the 2008 top achievers cash bonuses instead of vacations , says Clint Roswell , an IBM spokesman . <p> " We changed it this year to a cash program , because that 's what people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that some clients are not faring as well , he says . <p> The practice came under scrutiny in September , when Congress found out that AIG spent $443,000  --  including $20,000 on spa treatments  --  for about 70 top-selling insurance agents and a few AIG executives at a luxury California resort . It came just days after the federal government seized control of AIG to avert a bankruptcy filing . <p> AIG 's CEO had to explain the trip to Congress . The Bush administration described it as " despicable . " And as a result , AIG scrapped over $80 million in incentive trips and other meetings through this year . <p> As the economy continues to flail , public opinion of trips keeps falling . Wells Fargo  --  one of nine banks bailed out  --  canceled a 12-day event in Las Vegas this month following media coverage and criticism . <p> General Motors has now canceled most of its dealer incentive trips , says Peter Ternes , a GM spokesman . Chrysler eliminated its dealer incentive trips and its 2009 recognition business meeting , says Carrie McElwee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the entire auto industry , Toyota suspended incentive trips this year , says Zoe Zeigler , a Toyota spokeswoman . <p> The industry that handles the planning of incentive trips , corporate meetings and events reports business is down by about 35% , Anderson says . <p> Fay Beauchine , a top executive with Carlson Marketing , one of the USA 's biggest planners of incentive trips and corporate meetings , says that many clients are asking for " creative ways to help them save money , " such as shorter trips and smaller invitation lists . <p> Maritz Travel , the other dominant incentive travel-planning firm , says that portion of its business is down about 20% from last year . This downturn is different than post-9/11 , when flying became a patriotic act , says Maritz CEO Christine Duffy . <p> " Now it 's almost become unpatriotic to have a meeting or bring people together , " she says . <p> Travel industry feels the pain <p> With travel vital to communities across the USA , the U.S. Travel Association is mounting a major offensive to quell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unusual coalition with seven other associations to " reframe the debate , " says Geoff Freeman of the USTA . <p> " The fight is not with meetings , events and travel , " he says . " The problem is with irresponsibility . The grandstanding has scared companies of all stripes and colors , whether they 've taken money from the federal government or not . " <p> The industry 's also worried about legislative attempts to curb travel and entertainment . On Tuesday , Sen. John Kerry , D-Mass. , introduced legislation to ban recipients of the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) for two years from hosting , sponsoring or paying for entertainment or holiday events . <p> As the fight continues on Capitol Hill , many remain caught in the cross hairs : <p> *Upscale hotels . Incentives , meetings and events typically generate 40% of a typical Marriott-brand hotel 's volume , says Arne Sorenson , Marriott 's chief financial officer . This year , Marriott 's group business is down 12% due to the vilification of meetings . He says " thousands " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Cosslett says he expects InterContinental 's midpriced Holiday Inn chain to benefit from the new frugal approach . <p> *Las Vegas . This year , Vegas expects to lose at least $20 million worth of trips and meetings from Fortune 500 clients , says Rossi Ralenkotter , CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority . <p> This month , State Farm canceled the sales convention it holds there every three years , says Jeff McCollum , a company spokesman , wiping out revenue that would 've come from 17,000 agents , plus spouses . Visitors who come with business groups typically spend $1,200 at casinos , vs. $700 spent by those who pay their own way , Ralenkotter says . <p> Goldman Sachs , which has taken $10 billion from the government , canceled its annual technology conference at Mandalay Bay Resort &amp; Casino because of the new climate , says Gia Maron , a company spokeswoman . She declined to say if it saved money , since Goldman paid cancellation fees , then rebooked the event at the San Francisco Marriott . <p> *Small businesses . Cutbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rely on corporate gatherings . Silvano Zanetti , who owns Cafe Cipriani in Irving , Texas , has long relied on free-spending corporate groups and conventioneers . But business is down 40% to 50% because the local Four Seasons , Marriott and Omni are emptier now , he says . " We hope we will survive , " he says . <p> The Athens , Ga. - based band Seven 7 , which plays events for Wal-Mart and other big companies , has clients canceling at the last minute , band leader John Kirsch says . They 're not even complaining about paying cancellation fees , he says . <p> *Workers . Canceling trips can hurt morale and raise turnover , Hebert says , adding that they are huge motivators largely because spouses want to go . " There 's a huge psychological pressure for them to hit their numbers to go every year , " he says . <p> Adds author and professional speaker Scott McKain : " There are thousands of disgruntled couples because they were planning their vacations around these trips . " <p> To protect morale when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , Ternes says . GM also told them the trip could be reinstated at a later date , once the economy improves , he says . <p> Those who are still going <p> Despite fear of public perceptions , many healthy companies continue to offer incentive trips  --  something that Congress is n't criticizing . Cummings says that companies that are n't using taxpayer dollars " should be allowed to carry on business as they normally do . " <p> At software giant CA , exotic vacations have long been used to attract and reward top sales talent . This year 's upcoming six-day trip to top resorts in New Zealand and Australia will be CA 's 29th-consecutive trip . CA has even run ads in The Wall Street Journal featuring trip photos to entice sales professionals to send resumes . <p> Bill Hughes , a CA executive , credits the sales-incentive trips with helping CA retain all but one of its 150 best sales performers . <p> " One of the things you want to do in this economy is make sure your sales force is hitting on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to distinguish yourself from your competitors . " <p> BMW North America does n't plan to tinker with its incentive travel program for dealers , general managers and salespeople because the company believes they pay for themselves , says Wayne Orchowski , BMW 's vice president of sales . <p> His division regularly recognizes BMW 's top 10% of dealers . They 've taken exotic trips , such as an African safari and a trip to China to see the Great Wall . They 've also experienced what money ca n't easily buy , such as having Tony Bennett serenade them at a moonlit dinner . <p> It 's not only about recognition , Orchowski says . On trips , people spend a good deal of time networking and discussing best practices . And they 're exposed to experiences that will help them better relate to BMW 's well-heeled clients , he says . <p> " Times are tough , " Orchowski says . " But you have to be prudent where you make your cuts . You want to keep cultivating the soil to make sure things keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that incentive trips have become something that many people expect or at least aspire to as their careers advance . <p> " It 's based on the American dream , " she says . " If you work really hard , you can achieve something that normally seems outside of your realm of possibility . It 's easier to give that extra amount once you 've experienced one of these programs . " Policies to limit company junkets <p> Under the bailout plan , U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , companies will have to set travel and events policies designed to discourage junkets . <p> The policies must be posted on the company 's website . Government regulators will determine if the company 's activities violate those policies . <p> The U.S. Travel Association is fighting regulation because it could scare healthier companies from traveling , says the group 's lobbyist , Geoff Freeman . The organization has crafted a model policy for companies , which includes : <p> *Draft controls to ensure that trips or events serve legitimate business purposes and costs are justified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual trip or event costs to 15% of total sales and marketing . <p> *Limit senior executives attendance on incentive trips to 10% of guests . <p> By Barbara De Lollis <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
