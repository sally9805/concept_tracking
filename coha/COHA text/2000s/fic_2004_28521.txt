Chapter One A tournament in France , 1230 Fulk de Galliard , the undisputed champion of that day 's melee , lay facedown in the dust and wept like a child . Beside him sprawled his elder brother , his eyes still open to the hot sky . Proud , bold Rabel - witty and sarcastic and now utterly dead . It had not been one of their usual arguments , for Fulk had thrown the first blow . A single , fatal blow . Fulk raised his head and met his lord father 's terrible , wounded eyes . He held up his bloodied right fist . " Cut it off , " he begged . The count shook his head slowly . " I will do nothing for you . You are an abomination ... you are my son no longer . " Fulk sat up , wrenched his dagger free and sawed the blade against his wrist . If his father would not rid him of the offending hand , he would do it himself . " Stop ! " The count kicked the bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mercy of Rabel 's comrades . " As Rabel 's body was carried from the practice grounds , the grim knights surrounded Fulk . He took a deep breath , but made no effort to defend himself . They laid into him with their fists and the flats of their swords . Fulk never uttered a sound . He took the beating as though he were made of stone . But before the blackness took him , he had onelast coherent thought . I hope they 've killed me. * * * He eased his eyes open . It was dark . Freezing . Then he remembered . Rabel is dead . And if the pain and misery and cold were any indication , Fulk was not . A pity . Rain spattered against his face . From the smell , he knew he lay in a mixture of mud , blood and horse dung . And would no doubt remain there , for the slightest attempt to move produced screams of protest from his limbs . A squelching noise grew louder , accompanied by the sputtering of torches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A good thing , and high time . He relaxed into the muck . " Fulk ... dearling , mon pauvre ami ! What have they done to you ? " Fulk suppressed a groan and shut his eyes against this fresh humiliation . The beautiful Lady Greyhaven , his friend and advisor , arrived to rescue him . God bless her . And curse her . She barked orders . " Come , get him onto the litter ! Gently , gently now ! " Silk whispered across his brow , and the scents of violet , lavender , rose and musk came to him . Fulk reopened his eyes . The hands that lifted him were many , but did not belong to men-servants . Women . Fully a dozen of them . Dazzling gifts from God and yet the bane of his life . And all gazed at him with loving adoration . " We know it was an accident , Fulk , everyone - " " Shh ! He needs a bed , bath and bandages , not talk ! " " God , he weighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would know , Clothilde ! " " Ah , Fulk , with the good Lord 's grace you will be well in no time .... " " Stop thinking of yourself , Pierrette , for I am certain that is your main worry - " Fulk could bear it no longer . " For the love of God - my dear ladies - spare me your concern . " " Fulk , be quiet . " Lady Greyhaven briskly bound his wrist with a cloth , laid his hand over his chest and covered him with a heavy blanket . " Allez ! To the chateau ! " She is a commander worthy of any fighting force , Fulk thought fuzzily . Why did she have to come ? The merciful thing would be to simply let him die . But he was too weak to do anything but submit , as blessed oblivion reclaimed him . England , 1237 " With all due respect - a pox upon thee , milady ! " The young man 's voice cracked with indignation . Fulk de Galliard wiped his sweaty forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining his charger 's legs . Bryce , squire to the Duke of Warrick , was not normally given to cursing women . But then again , women were not usually found in the combatants ' waiting area , especially at such a throat-parching tournament as this . The apparent object of the lad 's ire stood out of sight , on the off-side of the great-horse he attended . All Fulk could see was a pair of small , well-shod feet , their soft leather boots wrinkling at the ankles - with bronze spurs strapped thereon . In a grim tone " milady " responded , " Squire , you made a promise , and now it must be kept . Else look well to your own arse , for I will not be denied . " The small feet broadened their stance . After a moment 's hesitation , Bryce gave a resigned sigh and held out the charger 's reins . A gloved hand took them . " Many thanks , sir . I will care for him well . Rest easy , the duke will forgive us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The squire sounded close to despair . The young woman stepped into view . Garbed in a dusty crimson overgown , her skirts hiked into her belt , she led the restless white stallion away . Her thick plait of hip-length , sun-bleached hair swung to and fro as she walked , and with each confident stride , steely gleams escaped from beneath the uplifted folds of her kirtle . She wears a mail shift ? Fulk stared and wondered what to make of such a beguiling spectacle . " Oh , Lord ! I am dead ! " Bryce groaned as girl and beast disappeared into the noisy confusion of the tournament grounds . " She has as good as stolen the duke 's finest tourney horse . Why do I allow her to do this to me ? " ( Continues ... )
