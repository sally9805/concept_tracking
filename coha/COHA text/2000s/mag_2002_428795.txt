PT EDITOR IN CHIEF ROBERT EPSTEIN RECENTLY TALKED WITH PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER ABOUT HIS MEMORIES OF GROWING UP DOWN SOUTH // History will most likely record Jimmy Carter as one of our country 's most important statesmen and greatest peace  --  makers . Known as a man of mighty moral fiber , the 39th president of the United States has spent his years out of office building homes with Habitat for Humanity , maintaining his peanut farm in Plains , Georgia , and chairing the Carter Center in Atlanta . There , he and his wife , Rosalynn , work closely together  --  much as they did during his administration-promoting democracy , health , peace and human rights in more than 50 countries around the world . The Center also has an innovative mental health program , which , among other things , offers fellowships to journalists who write about mental health issues . Carter 's latest book , An Hour Before Daylight . Memories of a Rural Boyhood , vividly recounts his childhood on a Georgia farm , where , it seems , the seeds of greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your new book , you were selling peanuts at age five , hunting with your dog at age six , setting up your first business at age eight and driving a pick-up truck by age 12 . Kids are n't allowed to do such things anymore . Do you think that 's a mistake ? Jimmy Carter JC : Well , I learned in a hurry because , first of all , my daddy needed help on the farm . Second , he believed that I should learn the principles of being an entrepreneur at an early ay . Third , it was during the Depression years , when any income was helpful , although not crucial in our case . And I think that my father looked at me as a kind of partner . Remember , this was a time when an isolated farm community gave you protection against the outside world . And I was driving a pick-up truck at the age of 12 , but I started driving earlier , just hauling stuff from the barn to the field-seed peanuts , corn , cotton or fertilizer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pick-up truck down to Plains , which is two and a half miles away So what I did was not extraordinary at all for the times and the environment RE : Do you think , though , that we underestimate our children ? We seem to treat them as children for a very , very long time . JC : I think so . In a rural community even in these modern days , a lot of the farm boys and girls begin to drive a vehicle on the field roads and off the main highways at a very early age . And its still common around here for young boys to get acquainted with firearms for hunting . But I think in an urban or suburban environment , it would he out of the question to have young kids with firearms and children under the age of 16 attempting to drive a vehicle . So I think its mainly the environment rather than the time . RE : There 's a person who emerges as a powerful human being throughout your book . And that , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us about him ? JC : We had a unique relationship . I was Daddy 's only son at that time ; Billy came 13 years after I did . Daddy was my hero in every way , and deservedly so . He was the best tennis player in the community and an outstanding baseball player . The days he did n't pitch on the American Legion team , he taught baseball . He was a fine diver , an excellent fisherman , a hunter , as well as a hardworking and successful businessman . So I looked on my father with something of idolatry , in that whatever my daddy did was what I wanted to do someday My mother was a different influence on my life . She was a registered nurse , and in those days private duty was 20 hours per day . She only had four hours to come home , change clothes , take a bath and buy groceries . Daddy was a very strict disciplinarian . Mother was much more easygoing and benevolent in her attitude . I would say that they had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but both were very beneficiaL RE : I was struck by a passage in your book that had to do with your father 's death in 1953 . You were at your father 's deathbed . At this point you were in the Navy , and your life was about to change . You wrote , " I felt besieged by an unwelcome comparison of the ultimate value of my life with his-I could not escape a startling and disturbing mmn , finn- who. thor I wanted to resign my commission and try to follow in his footsteps in this tiny rural community . Rosalynn was shocked and furious a few days later when I told her that I had decided to do just that . " JC : From the time I was five or six years old , if anyone asked me what I was going to do when I grew up , I never did say I wanted to he an engineer or a policeman or a fireman . I always said , " I want to go to Annapolis and he a Naval officer . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother was in the Navy and he sent me souvenirs from Singapore , Japan , China . That was my unswerving and unique ambition , and then I finally did get to Annapolis . I served in the Navy , in all , for 11 years . I never intended to do anything except finish 30 years in the Navy , get to the top of my potential in rank and then retire either in Hawaii or Annapolis . So when I decided at my father 's bedside to abandon all of that and come hack to Plains , it was indeed the most important turning point in my whole life . I did n't even discuss it with Rosalynn in advance ; I had made up my mind . She was not only distressed , but absolutely furious . When I finally did get my resignation approved and we drove the 650 miles or so to Plains with three little boys in the car , she hardly spoke to me . In Plains , she felt my very strong-willed mother and her very strong-willed mother would dominate her for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Rosalynn began to feel reconciled with coming home . We lived in the government housing project , and the whole first year we were home we made less than $300 altogether . I never had any thoughts about politics then . RE : We all know you as a man of great moral character , and I was struck in the hook by the fact that you were punished as a child . You were paddled in school , and you were occasionally , as you put it , " whipped by your daddy " Do you think that punishment is important in creating moral character ? JG : Well , I treated my own boys , I have to confess , the same way If I told them to do something and they disobeyed my orders or told me a lie , I punished them in a similar fashion to how my father punished me . When they had their own children and treated them with incredible latitude-letting them deliberately violate instructions without any punishment-I was really distressed about the kids future . But I have to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own children did . So I think there 's a difference in generational attitudes , and the modern-day way of raising children is probably superior . Photograph // RE : Another big influence in your life has been your religious upbringing . You were raised a Baptist , and there was religious training in your school every morning . Do you think your religious background helped to build your moral character ? JC : Well , without necessarily agreeing with your analysis of my character , let me say that having a deep , unswerving faith has obviously been a very fine factor in my life . I wrote a book a few years back called Living Faith , and in it I described how each human being actually lives on Faith . The first faith I described was the faith that the baby has in the mother , and then later in the father , then in siblings and playmates , and then maybe in teachers or one 's nation or close friends . And then ultimately I would say , in God and in oneself . So I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes duplicated and sometimes changing , is what really gives us inspiration and sustenance in moments of stress or trial . I quote my high school principal : " We must accommodate changing times , but cling to unchanging principles . " I think part of our unchanging principles is our basic religious heritage . RE : I 'm curious about a cousin of yours , Linton Slappey . In one paragraph in your book , you suggest that he might have suffered from bipolar disorder . What became of him ? JC : Linton was the life of Plains . He would come home from the state mental asylum and would at first be very sedate and well-behaved . The longer he stayed away from medical care , the more loud and abusive he got . Rosalynn was quite frightened of him : I was not But eventually , modem-day sedatives came along to quiet down emotionally disturbed , hyperactive people . Linton was in a nursing home . But when we visited then , a lot of his spirit went out of him He was a very intelligent person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued and who had lost his exciting character . RE : So he was probably overmedicated . JC : I think he was . And that may be the case in mental treatment centers now . I would imagine that nurses , who are overloaded with patients , give too much medication rather than not enough , just so the patients will be more docile . RE : Unfortunately , that is the case . It depends on the facility ; of course . The better facilities have more staff , and they do n't have to rely on medication quite as much . You and Rosalynn have done extraordinary work in the area of mental health , and I know that the Carter Center has an excellent program . Are you optimistic about the future of mental health under the current administration ? JC : Its hard to say yet I do n't know of any particular statements or comments that have been addressed to the mental health issue . As you know , Rosalynn has worked for two things for the last 30 years , One is the elimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other is total equality in all the government and insurance programs for people who have a mental illness . If the Bush administration has commented on that subJect , I doniA know about it But I hope that there will be some strong move in this fouryear period to respect patients and accept mental illness as a legitimate and important concern . // READ MORE ABOUT IT : Sidebar WORDS FOR AMERICA BY JIMMY CARTER Our nation has been stricken by an unprecedented attack that will be remembered forever . We will survive , because we are the strongest , most powerful , most freedom-loving nation of all , but the scars and the lessons will remain . At this critical time , we must support our nation and its leaders , and our actions must reflect the founding principles of America . In particular , I believe that we must protect freedoms at home , enhancing security needs without curtailing the blessings of liberty . At the Carter Center , we sponsor health programs and peace efforts worldwide in an effort to eliminate the root causes of suffering . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voiceless and hope to the hopeless , are critical to eliminating the desperate conditions that terrorists attempt to exploit . I hope you will join Rosalynn and me in praying for the families of those who have lost loved ones in senseless violence and for a quick and successful end to the current conflict . Each of us , through our prayers and acts of kindness , can help end the suffering of others . In our own way , we can contribute to peace in the world . // <p>
