In the 1890s , New York City was unrepentantly wide open . Day or night , a man with a thirst or a letch or the urge to gamble could satisfy his cravings with ease . Long past midnight , small bands played in dozens of Manhattan concert saloons while prostitutes in floor-length dresses trawled the tables . Streetwalkers divvied up the various corners in the Tenderloin , and touts handed out cards for $1-a-date Bowery brothels . Bettors wanting action could wander into Frank Farrell 's crystal-chandeliered casino on West 33rd Street . Tourists could smoke opium in no-frills dens in Chinatown . <P> And where were the cops ? Quite a few were busy taking bribes . It was no secret that crooked officers shared their illegal profits with an equally corrupt Democratic political club , Tammany Hall .

He scored a few successes initially , weeding out corrupt veterans . To see whether patrolmen were walking their beats , he began making the same rounds late at night and incognito  --  though at times in the company of a newspaper reporter . Once , Roosevelt found three bluecoats loitering outside a saloon at 2:30 a.m . " What are you men doing here ? " he asked abruptly . " What the %$* &#; is that your business ? " snapped one of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then introduced himself and lectured them on performing their duty . " These midnight rambles are great fun , " he later confided to his sister Anna . " I get a glimpse of the real life of the swarming millions . " On some of those nights , Roosevelt 's companion was the photographer and social critic Jacob Riis ( How the Other Half Lives ) , who guided him through the circles of hell suffered by the city 's struggling immigrants .
