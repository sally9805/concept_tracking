Having Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr is all well and good , but in the words of Penguins general manager Craig Patrick , " We also needed the element that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take liberties . " // In plain speak that means having a few guys who like to knock opponents around , and over a three-day span last week Patrick got the element he wanted . In a bold series of moves that did n't cost Pittsburgh much , he acquired 6 ' 3 " , 230-pound checking wing Kevin Stevens from the Flyers , promoted rock-hard 6 ' 2 " , 215-pound winger Billy Tibbetts from the AHL ( 185 penalty minutes in 38 games ) and traded for a pair of gargantuan goons , the Wild 's 6 ' 8 " , 255-pound Steve McKenna and the Blue Jackets ' 6 ' 5 " , 235-pound Krzysztof Oliwa . ( Oliwa will be out until late next month with a broken right arm. ) // While Tibbetts and McKenna have been getting limited ice time , Stevens , playing alongside Jagr and Lemieux , has been barreling into people . " It certainly helps me feel safer , " says Lemieux of the roster overhaul . " Teams have to know that if they 're going to be physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past several seasons the Penguins had been long on skill and short on strength , but only after seeing opponents rough up Lemieux did Patrick rectify this shortcoming . On Jan. 9 , 6 ' 7 " , 240-pound Bruin Hal Gill tangled with Lemieux away from the puck . Three days later the Islanders ' 6 ' 9 " , 255-pound Zdeno Chara rapped Lemieux on the noggin with his stick . " Some panic set in , " says a Penguins executive . " We did n't have anybody to stand up to guys like that . " // Before the roster moves Pittsburgh 's only gritty operative was feisty Matthew Barnaby , but at 6-feet , 189 pounds he is n't an NHL heavyweight . Now Barnaby skates on the fourth line with McKenna and Tibbetts , and their presence on the bench can sometimes be protection enough . Says Coyotes G.M. Bobby Smith , " Teams know that those guys can come over the boards and make themselves felt pretty quickly . " // On Jan. 15 , two shifts into his Pittsburgh career , McKenna threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin Sawyer . The Penguins on the bench rose and cheered . " I do n't necessarily want to hurt anybody , " McKenna said . " The idea is just to let them know I 'm here , and to make sure they respect us. " // Dallas Youth Movement ? They 're Not Getting Younger // The Stars ' Ken Hitchcock , coach of a talented but aging club that won the Stanley Cup in 1999 and reached the finals last year , began the season with two goals : " We want to compete on the same high level , " he said , " but we also need to develop young players . We do n't want to be a team that 's good for a couple of years and then crashes and burns . " // The Dallas roster is sprinkled with young players , but they 've made little impact . Aside from second-year left wing Brenden Morrow , 22 , who was fifth on the Stars in goals , with 11 through last Saturday , and Brad Lukowich , 24 , who was playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 had more than seven points or averaged as much as 10 minutes of ice time . " It 's hard for young players to get time , " says center Joe Nieuwendyk , 34 . " We have a strong group of veterans who like to play . " // Hitchcock ca n't afford to rest those veterans if it means risking victories . Despite an excellent 27-14-4-1 record , the Stars were tied with the Sharks atop the Pacific Division through Saturday and will likely need to win the division to have a chance of hosting a playoff round . " They look the same as the team we played in the 1999 finals , " Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said about the Stars recently . " They 're still all about their older core and their goalie 35-year-old Ed Belfour. " // That makeup has kept Dallas playing at the level that Hitchcock wants . As for the other part of the plan , he says , " We still look at this as a year for development . It 's just that not all the young guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Coaches ' Poll One Game , One Goalie : Brodeur // Devils ' netminder Martin Brodeur received only 97,000 votes in the recently completed All-Star balloting , nearly 80,000 fewer than Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy and less than half the total of the Sabres ' Dominik Hasek . Yet even as fans were selecting Roy and Hasek to start for the North American and World teams , respectively , Brodeur was winning the support of a more educated electorate . SI asked the NHL 's head coaches ( who were granted anonymity in return for honest answers ) , " Which goalie would you want in the net for Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals ? " and seven of 25 respondents chose Brodeur . Hasek and Roy netted six votes apiece ; the other votes were scattered among four recipients . // " I like the way Brodeur accepts a challenge and makes big saves at the right time , " said an Eastern Conference coach . Brodeur was also praised for his ability to " handle the puck better than any other goalie. " // While those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 121 career playoff wins , no one who picked Hasek seemed bothered that he has n't won a Cup , as both Roy ( three ) and Brodeur ( two ) have done . " When Hasek 's at his best , there 's no question he 's the one you 'd want , " said one coach . // The steady Brodeur , however , received a compliment that may explain why coaches covet him but fans overlook him next to the acrobatic Hasek and the demonstrative Roy . " He 's just so solid , " a Brodeur supporter said . // Expansion Teams ' Success Sticking to a Simple Plan // When Doug Risebrough , general manager of the expansion Wild , was casting about for advice on building a team last year , one of the men he consulted was Panthers G.M. Bill Torrey , who presided over Florida 's record-setting 83-point expansion season in 1993-94 . Advised Torrey , " Assess what 's available , develop a philosophy and stick with it . " // It 's no accident that Risebrough and his counterpart on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Torrey 's and were quite successful in putting together their teams . Neither club appears to be playoff-bound , but both have beaten a few Stanley Cup contenders and run off short winning streaks . " We both learned from watching what previous expansion teams did , " said MacLean after Columbus ( 14-26-4-3 through Saturday ) split a home-and-home series against Minnesota ( 16-21-8-2 ) last week . " There were some things we knew we had to do . " Here are four of them . // Get goaltending skill and depth . The Blue Jackets wisely signed veteran free agent Ron Tugnutt last summer , even though they had already acquired promising Marc Denis , 23 , from the Avalanche . The Wild traded for talented Stars backup Manny Fernandez ( .917 save percentage ) and then selected Jamie MacLennan , a former No. 1 goalie for the Blues , in the expansion draft . // Assemble a blend of experience and youth . Minnesota plays three rookies , including dynamic 18-year-old left wing Marian Gaborik , but is anchored by established forwards Scott Pellerin and Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Blue Jackets have been led by seasoned wingers Geoff Sanderson and Steve Heinze. // Acquire veteran players from Europe . Columbus relies on the playmaking of 29-year-old Norwegian center Espen Knutsen and on the two-way effectiveness of 25-year-old wing David Vyborny from the Czech Republic . Minnesota gets steady play on the back line from 32-year-old Slovakian Lubomir Sekeras and 25-year-old Czech Ladislav Benysek. // Hire a veteran coach who believes in hands-on teaching . The Blue Jackets ' Dave King was a prominent coach in the Canadian national team program for nine years . The Wild 's Jacques Lemaire implemented the trapping style that the Devils thrived on in the mid-1990s. // Naturally , executing the plan is n't as simple as devising it , and MacLean and Risebrough say they 've been zonked by the complexities that running their teams involves . That may explain why when Torrey was asked what he would do if he were given control of an expansion team today , he replied , " Find a psychiatrist.
