My Wonderful Life Moment // How much impact could a one-pound ball of feathers have on the world ? It took death for me to find out . And so I write the story of a particular bird 's life , but it must begin at the end . // " Brainy Parrot Dies , Emotive to the End , " ran a New York Times science section headline on September 11 , 2007 , the day after our press release announcing Alex 's passing . " He knew his colors and shapes , he learned more than 100 English words , " wrote Benedict Carey , " and with his own brand of one-liners he established himself in television shows , scientific reports and news articles as perhaps the world 's most famous talking bird . " Carey quoted my friend , colleague , and expert on dolphin and elephant communication , Diana Reiss : " The work revolutionized the way we think of bird brains . That used to be a pejorative , but now we look at those brains  --  at least Alex 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same thing in the newspaper , magazine , radio , and television interviews that overwhelmed me those first few days . People would ask , " What is all the fuss about , why was Alex so special ? " and I 'd say , " Because a bird with a brain the size of a shelled walnut could do the kinds of things that young children do . And that changed our perception of what we mean by ? bird brain . ' It changed the way we think about animal thinking . " That was the scientific truth I had known for many years , and now the idea was beginning to be accepted . But that did n't help me with the personal devastation . // Friends drove up from Washington , D.C. , that first weekend to ensure I would not be alone , that I would eat and at least try to rest . I functioned each minute , hour , day on automatic pilot , doing whatever was necessary , deprived of sleep , torn by grief . And all amidst this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , yet not fully aware , not then , anyway . I was cognizant of the gathering acclaim , inevitably so because of this endless stream of interviews . But it seemed to involve someone else , or at least had an unreality to it . The phone would ring and I 'd click into " interview mode , " responding as I had many other times when something Alex had done occasioned a media blitz , responding in a professional manner to the inquiries . This time , however , I 'd fall apart until the next call . // Pictures of Alex appeared on CNN , in Time magazine , and in scores of other places across the country . National Public Radio ran a story on All Things Considered : " Alex the Parrot , an Apt Student , Passes Away . " ATC 's host , Melissa Block , said , " Alex shattered the notion that parrots are only capable of mimicking words . " Diane Sawyer did a two-and-a-half-minute segment on ABC 's Good Morning America  --  long for morning television , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obituary , " she began , " and I want to inform the next of kin about a death in the family . And , yes , the next of kin would be all of us . " She said that Alex had been a kind of bird genius , " opening new vistas on what animals can do . " She aired a video that showed Alex answering questions about the color , shape , and number of objects , and so on . The video landed on YouTube . The previous day , CBS anchor Katie Couric devoted more time to Alex 's life and death than to major political stories . // Two days later , the prominent British newspaper , The Guardian , wrote , " America is in mourning . Alex , the African Grey parrot who was smarter than the average U.S. president , has died at the relatively tender age of 31 . " The story was spreading around the world , eventually to Australia . Robyn Williams , from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 's radio Science Show , interviewed me , the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first time , five years earlier , we 'd talked about what other feats Alex might achieve in his future . Not this time . // I was told that the New York Times article had been the most e-mailed story of the day , even while General David Petraeus was testifying in Washington , D.C. , on Iraq . A second New York Times article , on September 12 , in its Editorial Notebook section , was titled simply " Alex the Parrot , " by Verlyn Klinkenborg . This piece was a little more philosophical than most . " Thinking about animals  --  and especially thinking about whether animals can think  --  is like looking at the world through a two-way mirror , " Klinkenborg began . " There , for example , on the other side of the mirror , is Alex . . . . But looking at Alex , who mastered a surprising vocabulary of words and concepts , the question is always how much of our reflection we see . " The article ended : " The value of the work lies in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves to expect from the animals around us . " A lovely piece , another acknowledgment . But it still felt unreal . // Even Jay Leno had a crack at Alex , on his late-night TV show . ( A friend told me about it ; I do n't have a working TV . ) " Sad news : a thirty-year-old parrot by the name of Alex , who had been used by researchers at Harvard University to study how parrots communicate , has died , " said Leno . " I believe his last words were , ? Yes , I want a cracker ! ' ? " He went on , " This parrot was very intelligent . They say he knew over one hundred words . They say his intelligence was somewhere between a dog and Miss Teen South Carolina . " Sigh . // By now every major newspaper had covered Alex 's death , noting his remarkable cognitive skills and our breakthrough work together . Even the venerable British science journal Nature wrote about it in " Farewell to a Famous Parrot . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal , mathematical and cognitive abilities , " noted David Chandler , " and the two have appeared on a wide variety of television programmes and popular press stories . " Chandler continued , " In the process , they have transformed people 's understanding of the mental abilities of non-human animals . " ( A bittersweet irony here : when I started working with Alex three decades earlier , a paper I submitted to Nature was summarily dismissed without review  --  as was another I had submitted more recently. ) //
