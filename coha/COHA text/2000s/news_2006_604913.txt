<p> BETHESDA , Md.  --  BET founder Robert Louis Johnson is calling the next phase of his career his " second act . " If it 's anything like the first , it 'll be worth tuning in . <p> Johnson , who became the nation 's first African-American billionaire when he sold the BET media empire for $3 billion to media giant Viacom in 2000 , has made a number of big purchases in the past few years , seeking out areas of the economy that have largely been untapped by African-Americans . <p> He 's now the biggest black hotelier in the country . He 's started hedge and private equity funds to invest in businesses and to provide investment vehicles for pension funds and others . And in 2002 he became the first African-American to wholly own a professional sports team when he bought the NBA franchise in Charlotte . <p> Johnson , who left BET in January and now owns RLJ Cos. , announced last month that he is starting a bank . Urban Trust Bank will be geared mainly toward African-Americans and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other banking options . <p> Johnson , 60 , the great-grandson of a freed slave , says his success has helped open doors for other minorities . Yet he makes no apologies that his main focus is building the bottom line . <p> " I 'm in business to make money , " says Johnson in a wide-ranging interview in his new offices in this Washington , D.C. , suburb . " You can do well and do good . But at first , you have to focus on the blocking and tackling of running a good business . " <p> That attitude has made Johnson an overwhelming business success . When he took BET public , it was the first black-owned company on the New York Stock Exchange . But his stance has frustrated and angered some African-Americans , such as Raleigh , N.C. , News &; Observer newspaper columnist Barry Saunders , who say Johnson flourished by selling low-cost programming that focused on sex and violence rather than quality shows that explored more enriching areas of black culture . " His history of exploiting African-Americans means he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Johnson , who goes by Bob , says he never started BET to be anything more than a money-making entertainment channel . " I never really embraced that notion that BET was an heirloom that belonged to the greater black society , " Johnson says . " BET was a business that had a great impact on African-American society , but it did n't belong to it . And so , my thing is that we want to contribute , we want to add value . But we have to operate according to the philosophy that you have to exist in a world where business decisions have to be made based on business , not on political notions or social agendas . " <p> Says friend and Essence magazine founder Edward Lewis : " He 's living the absolute American dream . ... He 's a quintessential American who happens to be black . " <p> As visitors walk in , Johnson is fumbling with the TV remote that controls the three flat-panel TVs in his earth-tone office . He finally finds what he is looking for : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis Cardinals . The other TVs are tuned to NBC and CNBC . <p> Johnson , dressed in a black suit with white pinstripes and wearing a black-and-white checked tie , casually sits on a leather couch in his office that is so new the carpet still has that **25;1266;TOOLONG smell . Pictures of his two children , Paige and Brett , adorn his clutter-free desk that has a nameplate from the Charlotte Bobcats reading " Bob Johnson . " <p> Modest origins <p> The nameplate seems a bit out of place . After all , there 's no question that Johnson , although somewhat unassuming , does n't need to identify himself here . This is , after all , his empire . <p> That 's a far cry from Johnson 's modest upbringing . <p> Johnson was born in Hickory , Miss. , the ninth of 10 children to Edna and Archie . His family soon moved to Freeport , Ill. , where Johnson grew up and his dad worked at the local battery factory . It was in Illinois where he had his first job , delivering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . <p> " I failed miserably , " Johnson says . " I could n't get up in the morning . Still ca n't . " <p> Johnson says growing up in such a large family taught him a key lesson early on . <p> " I knew that if we had a box of cookies in the house , you made sure you got yours fast , " he says , laughing . " What it did is it made you make decisions quick . ... If you talk to anyone from a large family , the tendency is you want to chart your own course , because otherwise how would you get recognized ? " <p> Johnson became the first member of his family to go to college , graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in social studies in 1968 . In 1972 , he received a master 's from Princeton University 's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs . <p> He soon moved to Washington , D.C. , and after a stint on Capitol Hill , he became a lobbyist for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Telecommunications Association . After accompanying a businessman with an idea to start a channel devoted to the elderly , Johnson came up with his own plan to start a channel geared toward African-Americans . <p> He had $15,000 , but needed $500,000 more . He turned to John Malone , then with Tele-Communications Inc. cable company and now chairman of Liberty Media . Malone agreed to a part-loan , part-equity deal , giving Johnson the money he needed to start BET . <p> " The concept was a good concept , " Malone says . " We rapidly saw that Bob ... was trustworthy , ( financially ) conservative , not in it for a quick buck . " <p> BET , originally Black Entertainment Television , hit the airwaves in 1980 , at first just a few hours a day . After struggling for several years , BET began to focus primarily on showing music videos gladly given to BET from the music labels to promote their artists . BET quickly became a hit . About 364,000 households watch BET every day , according to Nielsen Media Research . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand to include magazines , radio , books and a variety of TV channels , and eventually took the company public . But even after all the wealth and prestige , Johnson faced racism . Malone says he once saw Johnson mistaken for a chauffeur at a meeting of cable executives . <p> " There is an inherent lack of belief or lack of trust ... and he had to overcome that , " Malone said . <p> Johnson 's critics dogged him . <p> BET was criticized for concentrating on music videos that were too violent and sexual . Comedians protested that Johnson paid below-market rates to those who appeared on his channel . <p> In a 2002 piece that has been widely quoted since , Saunders , the Raleigh News &; Observer columnist , compared BET programming to crack cocaine . " He has to do a whole lot to make up for what he did with BET , " Saunders says . " There is a whole lot about Bob Johnson to admire : his persistence and his ambition and what he 's accomplished . But the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is always going to taint his image . " <p> Such criticism did not deter Johnson , who points out that the " E " in BET stands for entertainment . <p> Ed Gordon , who was an anchor at BET and hosted BET Tonight , says he sometimes clashed with Johnson about content but says Johnson was often held to a higher standard than someone who was white . And he says Johnson made some good moves he does n't get credit for , such as covering the Million Man March live in October 1995 despite the risk of getting heat from advertisers for breaking away from the typical entertainment programming . <p> " Bob Johnson does n't come out of his BET era unscathed , " says Gordon , who is now a host on NPR . " Did he make mistakes ? Absolutely . Could he have done perhaps a better job with programming ? Definitely . But is he an American icon , business leader , hero ? Absolutely . " <p> New business ventures <p> In 2000 , Johnson sold BET for $3billion to Viacom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It was bittersweet , " says Jim Winston , executive director of the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters . He says that although blacks were proud that Johnson 's company commanded such a huge price tag , they were disappointed to see it sold to a white-owned company . <p> While he stayed at BET until January , Johnson was rapidly getting involved in a variety of other businesses . Even though Johnson defends BET by saying financial decisions should be divorced from social concerns , his new business ventures are based , in part , on convincing universities , state pension funds and others that they need to be racially inclusive . <p> " State pension funds get their money from teachers , firemen , policemen ; many of those people are African-American . And those same African-Americans have worked their way , have sent their sons and daughters to Harvard , Yale , Princeton , Wharton , " says Johnson . <p> With a money-management team that includes many of these smart black professionals , Johnson has a simple question for institutions with large portfolios to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it ? " <p> At the same time Johnson was making changes in his professional life , he experienced turmoil in his personal life , with a divorce from his wife , Sheila Johnson , whom he met in college . The two were married for more than 30 years . <p> She has used the large settlement from the divorce to start her own business ventures , including a proposed hotel and spa near her home in Virginia horse country . She has also started a charitable foundation and is part-owner of the Washington Mystics women 's professional basketball team . <p> Building a sports franchise <p> Robert Johnson 's foray into professional sports is a work in progress . The Charlotte Bobcats , hit by a rash of injuries this season , have one of the worst records in the NBA this year . In an effort to boost attendance , Johnson has announced that he will reduce many season ticket prices for the 2006-07 season . RLJ officials call the moves normal growing pains of any new franchise , particularly one in a new arena with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public skepticism , given that the previous owner of the Charlotte franchise moved the team to New Orleans despite high attendance . <p> " He went into a place with a more of a ' wait-and-see attitude ' than he might have met in a city without an NBA history , " says NBA Commissioner David Stern , calling Johnson a great owner who understands the community , entertainment and product branding . <p> Johnson , while not offering a financial forecast , predicts that the Bobcats will be a playoff contender within a couple of years and says the team provides a host of intangible benefits  --  including keeping his name recognition high . In the end , he 's not worried about profitability . <p> " No one has ever lost money on an NBA franchise , and I do n't think anybody ever will . There are only 30 of them , and there will always be a greater fool out there looking to buy , " Johnson says . <p> In his latest move , Johnson last month announced he was buying controlling interest in a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , but it is attractive given its Florida location and national charter , allowing for expansion . Johnson renamed it Urban Trust Bank , will keep the Orlando location and open a branch in downtown Washington by fall . <p> Some analysts see long-term potential . Assets at minority-owned banks rose 14% in 2004 , compared with 11% for all federally insured lenders , according to Creative Investment Research , a Minneapolis-based firm . But the expansion in minority banking was driven largely by growth at Hispanic banks . African-American income and asset growth has been stagnant , according to Federal Reserve data . <p> " This is Bob Johnson . It 's not like this guy does n't have a track record of excellent strategy in ethnic submarkets . You 've got to respect that , " says William Cunningham , CEO of Creative Investment Research . <p> While the bank is focused on minorities , Johnson plans to market to a broad cross-section of urban dwellers . " Urban used to be a code word for black . It 's no longer a code word for black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban lifestyle , " Johnson says . <p> But Johnson and Dwight Bush , CEO of Urban Trust , say they 're particularly interested in helping increase the minority homeownership rate , which lags severely behind that of whites . They plan products from market rate to higher-cost , so-called subprime , loans to individuals with poor or no credit . Bush said the bank also plans to use alternative indicators of credit , aside from credit bureau scores , such as history of paying rent or utility bills , to cover more people . There have been discussions about branches at Wal-Mart or other stores and student loans . <p> Frank Hanna Jr. , a millionaire businessman from Atlanta who had owned Metro Bank since 2003 , has a share of the new bank , probably about 30% , Hanna says . Hanna says he will also sit on the board of the bank 's holding company . <p> Hanna and Johnson , who met through mutual friends , had been talking for several years about a joint project , including a possible venture-capital firm . After Johnson 's efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metro Bank deal . <p> " That 's when we decided it would be a good idea to be partners , " says Hanna , who says he is impressed with Johnson 's " integrity and vision . " <p> Hanna , who founded the debt-collection agency Nationwide Credit , now runs his own investment firm and is acquisitions director for Paladin Capital , a venture-capital fund set up shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks to invest in **25;1293;TOOLONG companies . <p> Why not ? <p> Those who know Johnson say they are not surprised he has chosen to continue to expand his fortune rather than take his money and fade away . <p> " That 's Bob , " says Winston of the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters , who has known Johnson since his days as a lobbyist and says he should be admired for training talented African-Americans in business . <p> " He 's always been looking for the next big deal , " he says . " And I suspect he always will be . " <p> Says Johnson : " The imperative is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , it is that it 's there . It 's probably the same thing that motivates people to climb high mountains or to try to break the world 's record in a balloon . It 's there , I think I can do it , why not ?
