Chapter One Bruno " Cheese " Cortese swung away from the scarred maple bar in the Code 7 cop hangout , a draft beer in one hand and a vodka gimlet in the other . His sturdy six-three frame crossed the sawdust strewn floor in his size fourteens in evenly-spaced , surprisingly light steps for a man of his heft . Ben E. King sang " I Who Have Nothing " on the juke , below the din of the place . " There you go , " he said to his date , placing the martini glass before her . He sat close to the handsome woman at an oval table . Someone had carved into its worn surface a crude cartoon of a skull wearing a policeman 's hat . " Cheers , again , " Madeleine Jirac responded , clinking her drink against his pint . She had light-colored eyes and thin , well-proportioned lips . The dark-haired woman was dressed casually in slacks , and was golden-hued from an afternoon session on a tanning bed . " No doubt . " He leaned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she smiled as their lips and tongues parted , " you think that Immanuel Kant would be a political consultant , a hack working for somebody like Mayor Fergadis , if he were alive today , huh ? " The crow's-feet at the edges of Cortese 's eyes became pronounced as his mouth crinkled into a half-moon . " ' Out of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing can ever be made . ' Now , a guy who has that kind of outlook , what else could he be suited for ? " " Would n't wanthim wasting time teaching , now , would we ? " Jirac sampled some of her drink . " Smart-ass . " She watched him over the rim . " You like it . " His beeper vibrated before he could formulate a retort . Going out with a woman smarter and older than he was kept him alert . He clicked off the beeper without looking at its screen . " Got ta batter up , baby . " " No cowboying , right ? " Her blunt fingers touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He got up , bent to kiss her again as he rubbed her back . " I 'll call you later , okay ? " " You better . " He finally took a sip of his beer . Then Cortese walked through an archway toward the exit . He rolled his shoulders like he always did to get loose , to work the tension from his neck down into his arms and lower regions . It was a habit from his days of high school football at St. Brigid 's , where he was a running back and made all-city one year . Peripherally he glimpsed someone in a corner booth , and had to look directly to make sure . The man he 'd spotted , sitting underneath a wall of photos ranging from cop tournament poker games to darts , pretended he was more interested in the frizzed dirty-blonde he was huddled against , and that he had n't noticed him . Cortese knew that was n't so , but what did it matter ? He snorted a laugh through his nose and went on through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway , where the bathrooms and an office were located , too . Andre , the head bartender , came out of the washroom and they nodded at each other . Plastered on the rear door was a monochromatic poster warning kids of the dangers of drugs . The waiflike teenage girl staring out from the announcement had a hand-drawn word balloon attached to her mouth stating , Discount blow job for cops . Cortese leaned a shoulder against the door as he simultaneously pressed against the release bar . He went outside to the usual tableau of busted-up crates and plastic trash bags found behind countless taverns , fast-food stands , and restaurants across the city . He paused and put a hand to an ear as he cocked his head into the humid night air . The theatrical actions were unnecessary , for the moaning was steady and audible . Another half-moon materialized on his face as he trudged to where he knew the sounds originated . He stuck a toothpick in his mouth and went across the warped blacktop of the back lot . To the rear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led up to a tier of brush and dirt paths . The paths wound their way into Elysian Park and part of Section D of Dodger Stadium . " Goddamn , Rafe , " Herlinda Delarocha murmured pleasurably . She was bent forward , her hands gripping a rusted pole . The woman 's panties were halfway down her spread thighs , and her jeans collapsed around her Doc Martens boots . The pole she held onto went upward to a dilapidated wooden overhang that was part of a small building on the back lot that once , many decades ago , had housed city fire hydrants and now was used as a storeroom . A lone floodlight , barely giving off illumination , washed the lovers in cream yellows . There was a pair of handcuffs snapped around the woman 's wrists . Cortese worked the pick in his teeth . He leaned on the corner of the shed , watching the two for several beats , listening to their rough lovemaking . Then he said , " We got to hook and book , pardner . " " Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Delarocha said hoarsely . " Ca n't you see I do n't give a fuck ? " " Cabrn . " " Ho . " " All right , " Rafael Santin grunted . He ceased and straightened up behind Delarocha . " You two ought to take that act and get a radio show . " He stepped back , shook his now limp penis , and hiked up his boxers and jeans . The pretty young woman stood erect and glared at Cortese . " What you lookin ' at , mothafuckah ? " She was a tall Latina with pronounced cheekbones and a teardrop tattoo in the corner of her heavily mascaraed right eye . Cortese flicked his toothpick at her exposed leg . " Bastard , " she flared . Cortese ignored her . " The Gargoyle has landed , Saint . " " Righteous . " Santin stepped from around Delarocha as she hitched her clothes around her wide hips . Patting her on the butt , he said , " See you later , Linda . " He started to step away with Cortese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping her bound . " Leave her ass like that , " Cortese chided . " Be cool , Cheese . " Santin tossed a key to the woman . " Sorry about that . " " That 's okay , baby , I know you got to run off with your bunghole buddy and fight crime and shit . " She undid the cuffs . " What a mouth , " Cortese remarked . " Do n't she , though ? " his partner observed admiringly . They turned to leave again . " Ai n't you gon na need these ? " Delarocha held the cuffs and key aloft . " Keep ' em . " His back to her , Santin waved his hand dismissively . " We got plenty . " " I 'll save ' em for next time , honey , " she chortled . The weak floodlight gleamed on her darkly lipsticked mouth , lined in black . She puckered her lips and blew Santin a kiss . He looked back at her upon hearing the smack and grinned . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cortese idly scratched his muscled belly . " I 'll pick my own route to ruin , padre . " Santin was an inch shorter and not as wide as Cortese . Where his partner was built like a slumming WWE wrestler , Santin had the body of a baller . He was solid but lean , with bulked up triceps and biceps . The two ambled side by side , around the corner of the Code 7 to the parking lot . Santin beeped off his Malibu SS 's alarm and unlocked the driver's-side door . " Hey , guess who the fuck was playin ' slap and tickle inside ? " Cortese sat on the passenger side of the cherry ' 72 Chevy . Santin juiced the ignition , and the big-block 420 rumbled alive on the first crank . " Who ? " he asked , unlatching the emergency brake . " Mr. Motto and some hard-lookin ' white trash broad I 've seen somewhere before . " Santin had backed the car up and then got the shifter into first . Wearily he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Korean-American born in Korea and raised in America . " Cortese grinned . " Whatever , Mister PC . Anyway that fuck carried on like he had n't eyed me , but we both know we peeped each other . " " Maybe McGuire 's got him working twenty-four-seven since she decided to run for mayor . If she can get some real dirt on the squad , her handlers must figure that 's good for a ten- or fifteen-point boost in a dead heat . " " Who 's doing her campaign ? " Cortese had rolled the window down and gazed into the side mirror . " I heard she 's been meeting with that slick prick Pablo Pastor . " " She 's going for the nuts , that 's for sure . " " Do n't she always ? " They drove along . " What 's up with Curtis ? " Cortese asked , to break the silence as they passed Eisenhower Park . Grooves appeared in Santin 's brow . " Man , that kid 's gon na kill me quicker than the goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , he 'd have no reason to be going to school . " " I guess I should n't crack about chickens and how they always come home to roost , huh ? " " Have I mentioned lately just how funny you are , mothafuckah ? " The two laughed softly . Santin sped through an intersection against a light turning red . In less than fifteen minutes , the Malibu was rolling through the core of the Venice Heights section , a dense twelve-miles-square area just west of downtown . The Heights-or V-12 , as the gang members called it-was like a lot of neighborhoods that had gone through various ethnographic transitions over the years . There was still a Greek restaurant that did overflow business during the week . But the tailor shop next to it had been replaced in the last three years with a carnicera complete with a full-scale plastic bull statue on its roof . There were also leftovers of the black businesses that used to populate the landscape . To be sure , the staple of African-American mom-and-pop outlets , the three Bs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as plentiful these days anywhere in L.A. But the West Texas Palace of Savory Meats , a rib-and-hot-links joint of citywide fame , was still owned and operated by a family who 'd been around since Santin had been a kid . " The Lanciliers . " Cortese nodded at a seven-story building of a design from the Beaux Arts era . Behind the structure the cross-town MTA subway train thundered along the elevated tracks . " And there 's Big T. " Santin made a left and guided the car toward a haphazard row of cypress trees alongside an auto parts store . He parked and the two alighted from the vehicle . " Z'up ? " Santin addressed Theo " Big T " Holton . He was an imposing black man a little over six-one with a wide beer-truck carriage of a body . He was always in a rumpled suit with one of his stingy-brim hats jammed over his cube of a head . " My crackhead snitch says Villa snuck back into town from El Paso last night . Says this meet has something to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new thing . " He took off his hat and scratched at his graying , short-cropped thatch . Santin got the Malibu 's trunk open to reveal several 870 semiautomatic shotguns and zippered duffel bags . " About what ? " " Nobody ' cept them locos up there in Lil Puppet 's crib " - he pointed at the apartment house- " know for sure . But me and Ronk figure it 's tied to what went down three days ago . The police chief of Juarez , across from El Paso , was driving back from mass in his supposedly bulletproof Suburban . " " The chief was cut down by heavy-duty ordnance a short two blocks from his headquarters . " The new speaker was Barry " Ronk " Culhane . He was Holton 's running buddy , a naturally slender individual who maintained a serious regimen of weights and bulking powders . His face was bristling with whiskers , and his thinning blond hair glistened with a recent application of Rogaine . " And Villa was made as one of the shooters ? " Cortese racked the twenty-gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head vigorously . " Not a positive , no . But we understand our boy was down there to have a face-to-face with Rosario Del Fuego . " Santin processed the information . Rosario and his maniacal brother Felix ran the so-called Baja cartel . In reality , the cartel was not headquartered in Baja . But the legend went that the two brothers engineered the assassination of a key member of the Columbian Cali cartel in a Baja whorehouse , thus solidifying the rise of their drug empire . " And he did this hit on the police chief on orders from the brothers ? " " The El Paso cops have issued an all-points for him , " Culhane added . " So let 's go ask him , " a fifth man spoke . Alvaro Acosta was in his dark blue patrolman 's uniform . The younger man 's black hair was cut military-precise , and the brown skin of his face was unblemished . " Okay , Mister Eager , we will . " Santin shut the trunk , then reconsidered and extracted two mini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also clipped a shell carrier onto his belt . He used his back pocket for his two-way . He handed the other one to Culhane . " Let 's be cool and cautious , " he said . Ronk Culhane took the instrument and sniffed the air . " Smells like testosterone . " Holton displayed a gap-toothed grin . The other three gave quick nods . Acosta looked on , impressed . This was where he belonged . " Okay , " Santin began , " Lil Puppet 's apartment is on the fourth floor , that corner with the blinds drawn , " he pointed . " There 's a side exit piled high with debris , so they ai n't goin ' out that way , que no ? Ronk , you take the initiate ' round back and come in through the laundry room . Us three will take the front . " " Do we need a warrant ? " Acosta said , a worried expression contorting his face . The four glared at him as if fungus was spilling out of his ears . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " We are in pursuit of an alleged cop killer . We have an eyewitness who saw Ramn ' Gargoyle ' Villa enter said domicile on or about twenty-two hundred hours . Said domicile is home to one Chester ' Lil Puppet ' Ochoa , who is out on parole and who can not consort with specifically named individuals . " " Villa being one of them , " Acosta piped in . " Now you gettin ' with the program . " Holton slapped him on the back . " Do n't let that high-yella twist McGuire get you all knotted up . We 're righteous . " He took his shotgun in both hands and shook it . " The streets belong to us . " " Fuckin ' A , " Ronk said . The team walked in a diagonal across the wide thoroughfare of Westlake Avenue toward the front of the Lancilier Apartments . A late model Passat drove by , the driver honking at the men . " Our fuckin ' fan club , " Cortese said , waving at the driver . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , " Santin quipped . " Especially if it keeps the dogs off of us , " Holton put in . The team split up as they got nearer . Culhane and Acosta trotted toward the rear along a narrow passageway alongside the apartment building . The trio arrived at the glass-paneled front door with a brightly lit vestibule beyond it . " Hold this , Sarge . " Holton handed his shotgun to Santin . He then extracted a lock-picking kit and removed the proper tools : a pick and a tension wrench . He bent and went to work . " You 'd think , " the big man muttered , " that these old locks would be easy . But Yale really knew how to make ' em back in the day . " " You got to get some new hobbies , Big T , " Cortese joked . He got the door unlatched . " My only hobby is justice , son , " he said in mock solemnity , straightening up . Santin handed the shotgun back to the detective . He took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint on the walls , the latest gang pictographs having been brushed over by the tenants . In the main hallway was an elevator , but these cops knew from experience that it seldom operated . The three got to the stairs in the rear and began to ascend beside the old-fashioned banister . Not too far from the Lancilier , Linda Delarocha also ascended a set of stairs . These were wooden steps in need of repair that ran outside the rear of a two-story structure along a hilly street called Santa Ynez . She got to the top and opened the screen and inner door leading to an austere and clean kitchen . " ' Bout time , " her mother , Luca Delarocha , said . She was pouring juice into a glass . The woman , still a looker , who 'd recently turned forty , set the carton back on the shelf and closed the refrigerator . Outside , a clean-burning bus rumbled by . " I got held up . " The daughter lifted her year-old son , Frankie , out of his high chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily . " Sure you did , " her mother remarked knowingly . She drank her juice and placed the glass on the cracked tile of the counter . " Let 's not throw drama tonight , shall we ? " Linda Delarocha went though the kitchen 's swing door carrying her son , her mother following . The two entered a small dining room with a built-in sideboard and leaded glass cupboard . " Look , Linda , I made a lot of mistakes when I was younger , huh ? About the only thing I did right was have you when I was seventeen . But I ran those same streets you 're running now .
