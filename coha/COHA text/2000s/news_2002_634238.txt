<p> Near midnight on Friday , Secretary of State Colin Powell postponed a meeting with Yasser Arafat , after a Sabbath-eve suicide bombing killed at least seven people at an outdoor market in the middle of the city . <p> The State Department 's announcement that the highly anticipated meeting with the Palestinian leader had been postponed adds more days to Powell 's mission to break the rapidly escalating cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians . <p> Powell 's open-ended trip now seems assured to spill into next week , even as pressure grows from the White House for Arafat to denounce terrorism after this most recent bombing . <p> " I condemn the terrorists for this act , " Powell said . " It illustrates the exceptionally dangerous situation that exists here and the need for all of us , everyone , the international community , to exert every effort we can to find a solution . " <p> In Washington , White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said " the president is very troubled by what happened . And the president believes that if Yasser Arafat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounce terrorism , that today would be a particularly apt day for Yasser Arafat to publicly express himself in denunciation of this terrorist attack and to show leadership . " <p> The suicide attack was the second in a week and the 37th in Israel since January . It injured about 60 people and killed at least seven , including the bomber , a woman in her 20s , who hid the bomb on her body before detonating it by a bus stop in front of a bakery in the Mahane Yehuda market . The Jerusalem Post reported that the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade  --  a wing of Fatah , a faction of Arafat 's Palestine Liberation Organization  --  has taken responsibility for the attack , according to an anonymous caller to Hezbollah 's Al Manar TV in Lebanon . <p> Powell spent Friday in meetings with Israeli officials and took a helicopter tour of Israel 's northern border with Lebanon , which is also on the verge of erupting into conflict . The decision not to meet with Arafat today came very late from the State Department , and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Powell was " looking at the whole situation in terms of the bombing and where we stand and where we are , " a signal that Powell was debating whether to journey to the embattled West Bank , where Israeli soldiers have taken up positions in the Palestinian Authority 's major cities . <p> Powell came to Israel with neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians paying heed to preconditions set by President Bush  --  that Arafat denounce suicide bombings in Arabic and that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon withdraw troops from the West Bank . The Israelis have pulled back some troops in smaller villages but at the same time intensified efforts in other cities . Powell left his meetings Friday with no timetable for an Israeli pullback . <p> The most contentious issue to emerge by week 's end was the heavy death toll at the Jenin refugee camp , in the northern West Bank . The Israelis contend that the Jenin camp is the home or base to cadres of terrorists . <p> After meeting with Sharon in the morning at the prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks to reporters while the two stood side by side . While the United States " understands the need for Israel to defend itself , " he said , " as a friend of Israel , we have to take note of the long-term strategic consequences of the incursions that are under way and their effects on the nations in the regions and the international climate . " <p> While much media and diplomatic attention has been given in recent days to the besieged West Bank , Powell focused on the northern border , which has been under regular fire from Hezbollah militias . Powell learned of the Jerusalem marketplace bombings as he was about to board the helicopter for his short trip to the border . He then flew over the bombing scene before heading north . <p> " I call upon nations who have influence over Hezbollah , especially Syria , to do everything in its power to restrain Hezbollah and to stop this kind of activity before it widens the conflict in the region , " Powell said . <p> Powell and Sharon met one on one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four hours in all conferring with Israeli officials . <p> " Terror can not coexist with peace , " Sharon said . " The terrorism of suicide bombers represents a danger for Israel and for the entire free world . " <p> After conferring with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , Powell said he needs more than empty words from Arafat . <p> " I 'm not interested just in declarations ; I am interested in performance and action . In my conversations with Chairman Arafat , I will make that clear . What is important now is not just rhetoric going out into the air with no effect , but action that will bring this violence under control . Action that will give a feeling of hope to the people of the region . And that will be my message to Chairman Arafat , and we will see what his reaction is . This is just the beginning of a mission . We have , as I said , had good discussions , laid out positions held by Israel , positions held by President Bush and the American government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuanced war of words that has so often marked this conflict , Fleischer said the term " homicide bomber " will now be used by the White House , rather than the phrase " suicide bomber . " <p> " But the reason I started to use that term is because it 's a more accurate description , " Fleischer said . " These are not suicide bombings . These are not people who just kill themselves . These are people who deliberately go to murder others , with no regard to the values of their own life . These are murderers . " <p> Bloody scene <p> The bomber set off her powerful explosive near the front door of the bus near the bakery on Jaffa Road . <p> Blood splattered over fruits , vegetables and bread , which showered down on the road that runs through a residential area of central Jerusalem . Crews of Orthodox Jewish men gathered body parts for burial in keeping with strict religious customs . <p> A woman named Elisheva  --  she did not want her last name published  --  said she had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hands were bloody and her powder blue sweat shirt was streaked with red blood . <p> When the bomb exploded , she said , " I was right here on this street ... and all of the sudden there was a huge boom and the ground shook . And we all knew right away there was another terrorist attack . ... I ran over here to see if there was something I could do . There was a girl sitting over there , and I ended up holding her . This blood is not from me . Her face was gushing blood . And I was holding her , and we were crying together , and she said , ' Today is my 17th birthday ; why did this happen ? ' " <p> At 5:55 p.m. , six bodies , lined up perpendicular to the wrecked bus and wrapped in black plastic , were loaded into three ambulances . Forensic photos of the victims were attached to the body bags . Onlookers hung from balconies of the stone buildings overlooking the carnage . <p> For the last 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in fact the security force may have deterred the bomber from her real target , said Gil Kleinman , a spokesman for the Israeli police . Instead , he said , she targeted the bus stop , which Israelis call a bus station . <p> " Evidently because of the large police presence that we had for the last year and a half , she was not able to enter into the market , " he said . " Or she decided not to enter into the market , and as a result of that she turned to a bus station , a crowded bus station , and blew herself up . "
