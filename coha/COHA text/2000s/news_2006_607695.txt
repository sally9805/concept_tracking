<p> With more than 2,800 coaching victories among them , John Thompson , Jim Phelan and Morgan Wootten are three of the foremost names in the basketball coaching profession . The three gathered earlier in the season at The Washington Post to share their thoughts on the game in a discussion moderated by regular Post contributor John Feinstein . What follows are some highlights of that conversation . <p> John Feinstein : The easiest opening question , just to get his rolling , would be : Other than money , which is obvious , what is the biggest change you 've seen in the game since you guys coached  --  and John , in your case , played  --  in the late ' 50s-early ' 60s , in the last 45 to 50 years ? <p> John Thompson : The one thing that I think is most obvious is the coverage , the exposure of the game . When we started out , it was really more regional . But everything is national now , because of the Internet , because of the extensive coverage that is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaching and when I was coaching high school , most of the time you went away , you played in the tournament , that would be the national outlet . Now a high school can play in Washington and have an exceptional player , it goes across on the Internet , and it 's a whole different perspective . <p> Jim Phelan : I think that a couple things go along with what John said . Parental involvement , and involvement of outsiders , with coaches has certainly increased in great numbers . They 're there all the time . They want to know what you 're doing . They want to sit in on the practices . <p> And as far as the players themselves are concerned , I 'm looking at it going back to Thompson 's days and even beating Wootten to the coaching ranks the size and speed of the players . The talent has n't changed a great deal . They 're more talented but they 're bigger and faster , and I attribute that to diet and weight training and certainly much greater interest internationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the money . The game has become so international , and we know about it instantly . I think the bad elements have crept in that John was referring to : less control of the players , more people in there trying to use the kid to enhance their own ability , whatever that might be . <p> Feinstein : Where did those elements start to creep in ? <p> Thompson : I think it started with academic people being threatened by athletics . Anytime you get attention , you get recognition , there 's always an element of society that becomes very threatened by it . So we started by making legislation saying high school coaches could n't coach during the summer . We started making legislation limiting college coaches from being able to deal with their players . What we did n't realize is that we were empowering someone else , that if the kids were not able to play for their high school coach , or if the PE instructor was not able to do something , somebody else then would take over and do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You hit it on the head when you talked about AAU . The boys of summer . They 've stepped in and they 've taken over and they have a lot more power than most of the high school coaches in this country today . You talk to college coaches today , and they do n't deal with the high school coach very much . They have to go to the summer coach because he 's the one who 's going to make the decision . He 's the one who 's going to send the kid on . Those are some of the bad things that have happened . <p> I think one of the great things that has happened since back when John played with the Celtics and Jim and I were just getting started as coaches is that there are more great players than ever before . My word , it 's become the second-most popular sport in the world , and more kids are playing at an early age . It 's organized better . The coaching is better . The weightlifting , the diet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have happened also along with the fact that some bad things have happened . <p> Phelan : Sometimes I feel there 's not nearly as many great ones as they think there are . The guys we get at our level  --  and I 'm sure some of the guys you got at your level that did n't make the NBA  --  actually feel it was your fault . And the parents definitely do . So there 's not as many good ones or great one as they think there are . As a result , you 're stuck with , " My son is going to make it to the NBA . " I made the mistake one time of saying , " There is no way . " And the mother said , " I 'll buy you a ticket for the first game . " He was gone in a year . <p> Feinstein : How did the three of you feel when ESPN started , and now has continued , to televise high school games ? <p> Phelan : It 's exploded . They need to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , a lot of your games would have been on . <p> Phelan : That just would have made it worse , right , Morgan ? <p> Thompson : That would n't have made it worse . ' Cause he would have gotten paid for it . <p> Laughter <p> Thompson : No , hold on a second . That 's the checks and balances . If I 'm at St. Anthony 's High School and the building 's about to close  --  if the program is no good , the building closes . Do n't think for one minute that that man Wootten did n't keep DeMatha open . And that 's real . That had an effect on educating a hell of a lot of other kids . <p> Now ESPN comes to me and asks do I want to promote 10 St. Anthony 's games and I 'm sitting in the chair of the basketball coach , I look at it totally different than if I 'm on the air from 3 until 5 . I look at it totally different when it has a direct influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame the high school coach who wants to get on . <p> Feinstein : With all the influence of money , how much harder is it to coach ? <p> Wootten : I did n't allow that to take place . I think your really strong coaches and the ones that really were successful , they did n't allow that to happen . But it happens in the great majority of places . And these kids start listening and believing in themselves . It 's great to build a kid 's confidence up : " You 're a fine player . You can be a good college player and have a great future . Who knows ? You may have a chance to play at the highest level . " But when every kid on your team has had that fed into their ear , that makes things kind of rough . <p> Phelan : I would get the phone calls that would say , " I 've got a kid who can really play for you . " Well , I do n't want the kids who can play for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him Thompson . They wear you out with that type of thing . I always ask the question , " Have you ever seen us play ? " And they say , " Well , no . " They 're the kind I dismiss immediately . <p> Wootten : It 's not just the press , though that convinces all these kids they can play in the NBA . I have seen kids that are going to visit a college and they 've shown me their itinerary for the visit . And the afternoon of the first day , they 're going to meet with the head coach between 2 and 3 to discuss how they 're going to be the next number one draft pick in the NBA . <p> Feinstein : Maryland Coach Gary Williams once told me one of the hardest things for him is , when you recruit a kid , you spend a lot of time telling him how good he is ; then you get him and the first day of practice you 've got to tell him how bad he is . How hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phelan : I 'd invite them in and tell them , " I guarantee you two things : Number one , I 'm going to try to get somebody better than you ; and number two , I do n't think I can , and I think you 're a fine player . " Naturally they 'd all say , " You 're going to try to get someone better than me ? " And most of them got over it after the initial shock , particularly after I couched it with " I do n't think I can . " Just so long as you know , if you 're there and somebody beats you out , so be it . <p> Feinstein : John , you had some pretty highly recruited players . <p> Thompson : Yeah , I told Patrick Ewing it never snowed in Washington . <p> Laughter <p> Thompson : He was sitting on the training table watching it snow outside , I told them to shut the blinds . He told me , " You said it never snowed here . " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't belong in college . " I think in all recruiting , there 's a certain amount of exaggeration that goes on . <p> There 's so many influences now that everybody thinks it 's going to be immediate gratification . That is one of the biggest differences in today 's kid . A kid years ago might have thought , " Okay , by the time I get to be a junior I 'll be pretty good and I 'll be ready to go to the NBA . " Now they 're taking the players out of high school . So Mama and Daddy want him to be a star immediately because they see other kids doing it <p> Wootten : John is so right about the age of instant gratification . That 's the age we live in . I had a young man who was not going to make the team as a senior . And I used to call them in , one-on-one , and pepped them up , you know : " Have a great life for yourself . You just are n't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came back the next day and wondered if I could meet with him and his mother . I said sure , they came in , and she understood completely . It was okay that her son did n't make the team ; we had a lot of good players and she understood how that could happen . But she just wanted to know one thing : Would this affect his making the NBA ? And she was dead serious . <p> They know just enough about the game now to be dangerous . <p> Feinstein : I want to throw out a statement and have the three of you to respond to it : The three-point shot has done more to damage the quality of play than any rule change or anything else that has happened in the last 25 years . Agree or disagree ? <p> Phelan : I do n't think that 's the case at all . You could say in some ways it brought back the little men , but now the big guys shoot them just as well as the little guys . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may see some damage because of the three-point shot . But early on , I do n't think it had an adverse effect . And it has made the game more interesting because you can get back into it quicker . <p> Thompson : It 's why Phelan can beat me . That 's why he likes it . <p> Feinstein to Thompson : You made the statement , when the three-point shot first came out , that if you can get three for a jump shot , you ought to get four for a dunk . <p> Thompson : Yeah , the layup . Absolutely . The layup is harder to get . So you should get more for that . <p> It 's unfair to want a coach to be fair . It 's an unfair expectation . That 's the nature of competition . If I 've got big guys , I want more for a layup than I want for a jump shot . If Phelan knows I 'm going to be able to get all the great big guys , what 's he going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-point shot into it . <p> Wootten : I think the three-point shot has hurt , and I think it 's helped . We 've lost the great post men . Back in John 's day , the post men were a pleasure to watch play . You ca n't find anybody that wants to be a post man any more . They all want to shoot three-point shots . So that 's changed the game . <p> Thompson : They do everything because they ca n't dominate at anything . You 're 100 percent correct about that . The kids want to be well-rounded players . Bill Russell was not a well-rounded player . He just dominated . <p> I used to say to kids : " If you want to make the pros , find one area of the game that you can create value for yourself with . Do n't try to be able to do everything . Make sure you 're able to have a certain area of the game where they have a need . " Dikembe Mutombo was the perfect example of that : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes pretty darn valuable to you . And then the rest of his game caught up with him . <p> Phelan : Like John said , nobody can play with their back to the basket , or very few can , with moves . <p> Thompson : That 's the big difference now . We 've got AAU and informal coaching . If a kid went to Morgan , a part of his system would be , " You play here . You do this . " If I go play for somebody  --  and not just AAU , but whoever these private people are  --  he lets you do whatever you want to do because he wants to ingratiate himself . It 's hard to teach somebody without making an enemy out of them sometimes . If I want to maintain a relationship so I can get a piece of the pie , I 'm going to let him do whatever he wants to do . <p> Wootten : If they do n't have what they want at School One , then they transfer to School Two . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became a good player in the ACC . He went to five different high schools . And he had good years at all five ! He played the way he wanted at all five . <p> Thompson : That 's what I 'm saying . If I 'm going to play for Wootten , I know he 's in charge . I know I 've got to do what he tells me to do . But if I 'm a coach who 's trying to ingratiate himself with a shoe company and whatever else , what am I going to do ? I 'm going to say you do what you want ; I 'm not going to teach you any more . <p> I can remember telling Alonzo Mourning that he could n't do anything with his left hand . He 'd get mad . . . . Now , who 's going to make somebody with Alonzo 's ability mad coming out of high school ? <p> Phelan : I think another thing , in fairness to post men , is that in the NBA , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight seconds to get it across midcourt , you 've got 16 left to shoot ? So if you shove it to the post , which they do frequently , you 've got to shoot it . <p> Thompson : That 's the rule I hated most was the shot clock . That 's what I hated more than the three . <p> Feinstein : If each of you became the king of basketball right now , what are the changes you would make ? <p> Thompson : You 've got to empower the people who are coaching the kids . You ca n't coach people , at any level , by just giving a guy a title . I think the guys who are dedicated and want to work hard with their kids year-round should be permitted to do that . Because a principal , a league , whoever controls them , can hold them accountable . I think that 's extremely important . That 's the one thing I would say : Put the people back in authority who you can hold accountable . Empower the people who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball , it has n't hardly changed , except physically , since I was playing in the ' 40s and the ' 50s . Since World War II , it has n't changed an awful lot . There are a ton more players playing it , and they are bigger and they are faster . Are they more skilled ? Could Bill Russell come out and play now ? Are you serious ? Of course he could . Could Mikan play ? Could Cousy play ? Of course they could . They would be faster and stronger and have better diets . <p> Wootten : I would say John 's thing on empowerment is right on . That would be the number one thing . If that took place , then we could look at the game . If I left the three-point shot in  --  and I 'd have to take a long time to think about that  --  I 'd make it further back . <p> I think the game is too physical today , especially at the pro level . I 'd like to see them call walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call carrying the ball when they carry the ball . Call the rules that are there now . <p> The game is in pretty good shape . I asked what was the greatest rule change  --  it was Red Auerbach , me and John Wooden . Red said the shot clock , of course . John Wooden said the elimination of the jump ball after every basket . Me ? I said it was when they cut the bottom out of the peach basket . <p> We 've been a little negative here in our discussion . There are a lot of positive things about the game .
