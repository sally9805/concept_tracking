Chapter One Blackie " Blackwood , there 's trouble in the old neighborhood ! Murder in the sanctuary of the church ! " I glanced away from my computer and remarked again to myself that as he grew older , Sean Cardinal Cronin had come to look like a very High Church Anglican cleric , save for the scarlet shirts the latter affected . Tall , handsome , trim , broad-shouldered , white hair , immaculately groomed , perfectly tailored , and with a large ruby ring , a bejeweled pectoral cross , and only a touch of red at the edge of his Roman collar , he was much too presentable to be one of ours . Generally our kind look like tired and corrupt old men in funny dresses . Or dumpy little men in jeans and Chicago sports jackets like me . The Anglican illusion faded when one saw the wild Celtic blue eyes -- -a gallowglass mercenary warrior disguised as a prelate . " I have heard no alarms from St. Praxides , " I said , referring to my own neighborhood of origin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said impatiently . " A locked church murder at St. Lucy 's ! Three bodies ! " " Deplorable , " I sighed . And fascinating . " Mick Woljy wants the place reconsecrated right away and I 'm off to Rome topick up some heavy markers . So you 'd better see to it ! " " Markers " are part of a Chicago theory of economic exchange , though the theory originates not at The University but at City Hall . Suppose you ask me for a " personal favor . " I respond , " Name it and you got it . " Then I hold your marker , which entitles you a similar exchange , no questions asked . " They do n't believe in markers over there . " A wicked grin crossed his face . The return of the gallowglass . " They 'll believe in mine ... Look , do you know Mick Woljy ? " He put down his suitcase and the garment bag carrying his cardinalatial finery , shoved aside a stack of precious computer output , and sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his staff in hand and his loins girded . " Mikal Wolodyjowski , " I spoke his name with a proper Polish pronunciation , " by the length of his name and his demeanor a cultivated member of the Polish nobility . We Irish do n't have any such . " As best as I can transliterate the name is pronounced Volodyovaski . " He 's a great priest , " Milord Cronin repeated the defensive clerical clich . " He 's held that parish together for years , long after we should have closed it . Now it 's gentrifying he has everyone on his side , Blacks , whites , Hispanics , old-timers in the parish , and the yuppie newcomers . He says that the superstitions in the neighborhood are multicultural . He wants the church reconsecrated today -- -as soon as the cops get out . The school opens again next week . He 'll probably have to build a new and bigger one next year ... So get out there and reconsecrate the church . " Milord did not perceive the contradiction . They should have closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another new school . I sighed mentally . I had not been able to exorcise those who proclaimed themselves city planners for the Archdiocese . " I doubt that we can do that , " I replied with my loudest sigh of protest . " It is after all a temporary basement church , even if it is almost a century old . It was never consecrated in the first place . " The Poles and the Germans built beautiful churches when they arrived in America . We put up parochial schools and used the basement " school hall " for a church until we could build a " new " church . In some places for reasons of hard times , poverty , or pastoral indolence , the dream of the new church faded away . Milord Cronin frowned . He did not like liturgical rules to interfere with his plans . He leaned back in the chair , loins still girded but staff on the floor . " Mickey and I went through the seminary , then on to Rome for graduate school . We were never exactly close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got along all right . He 's an extraordinary guy , brilliant , cultivated , knows everything . The people out in the neighborhood seem to adore his European aristocratic style ... " He shut his eyes as if to blot out an unhappy memory . " Every Polish priest in the city thinks that he ought to have my job . And they 're right , Blackwood . He should be in this room talking to you , not me ... Only reason he does n't have it is that he 's Polish . In those days they were afraid to take that risk . " " I doubt that I would be in this room if Pan Mikal was in the room at the other end of the corridor . " " He 's never said a word to me about it , Blackwood , nor as far as I know to anyone else . Totally loyal , though he is incapable of anything else . Yet it must bother him . " " Arguably he prefers reviving St. Lucy 's to dealing with the Curia Romana . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the chair , metaphorical staff back in hand . " He needs help out there . I wo n't tolerate murders in one of my churches . See to it ! " He disappeared out the door of my office , a night train rushing through the darkness . His trip to Rome boded no good for anyone . The subject of his markers doubtless pertained to his approaching seventy-fifth birthday . He would be expected to submit his resignation . It would not be accepted , because the Curia lived in mortal fear of Sean Cronin . They knew full well over there that he did not give a damn about them and their increasingly empty power . A resigned Sean Cronin would be an even looser cannon . He might insist , even demand that his resignation be accepted . Or he might impose conditions for staying in power that would push them into a corner . Nor were they likely to find consolation in appearances of declining health . Nora Cronin , his foster sister and sister-in-law ( and one time long ago , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had participated in a makeover aided and abetted by a certain all-seeing little auxiliary bishop -- -one cup of coffee every morning , one small glass of Bushmill 's every evening , exercise every day , proper meals ( of the sort I would never eat ) , a day off every week , a limited schedule of confirmation and anniversary appointments in the parishes , and a cap on the number of staff meetings a week . This remake had permitted the Cronin genes to reassert themselves and he would appear in Rome as indestructible . The good Nora had not , however , been able to constrain his manic gallowglass moods . I doubt that she wanted to . I called my friend Mike Casey -- -aka Mike the Cop -- -for the lay of the land out in St. Lucy 's . " It 's the Lake Street L , " Mike assured me , " Developers have finally figured out that it 's twenty minutes to downtown inside Chicago just as it is across Austin Boulevard in Oak Park . So there 's a boom between Central and Austin for six blocks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rehab , just like Ravenswood . The homes on West End are as elegant as any in the city . And the new town houses in close to the L are designed for prosperous Yuppies . Cops are cleaning up drug action against the south end of the tracks . There 's St. Lucy 's and St. Catherine 's grade schools and Fenwick and Trinity High Schools . Too bad they closed Sienna . Anyway , Austin is ready for rebirth and as a native of Austin like Sean Cronin I say it 's high time . " I wondered to myself what would happen when the poor were exiled from the city to suburbs and the city , like Paris , became a bastion of the white upper middle class . Again . Many of the neighborhoods of the city had been resegregated as Blacks pushing for living space had moved into white neighborhoods and whites , panicked by real estate brokers called " blockbusters , " fled farther out in the city 's rings and into the suburbs . Then these neighborhoods deteriorated as the black middle class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the neighborhoods deteriorated physically . The next phase was the rediscovery of the possibility of the neighborhoods by the new urban professional class in search of good transportation routes back downtown . In a suburb like Oak Park , just across Austin Boulevard , the blockbusters had been foiled by property value insurance which protected home owners from panic . So now Austin was creeping towards emergence as a multiracial , multiclass community -- -a hard journey to rebirth . " The three murders will delay that rebirth ? " " For a while maybe . The change , now that it 's started , is too powerful to stop . It 's dawning on people , then on developers , that transportation is the driving force in this city . " How did we ever forget that , I wondered . " And the local cops ? " " Fifteenth Precinct -- -Austin . Over on Chicago Avenue near Laramie . Lieutenant Dawn Collins is the head of Homicide there . Area Five Homicide may try to take over but only if they want a fight with Dawn . She 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out there . She 's African-American and Catholic . " " Are n't they all ? " I sighed loudly . There ought not to be violent crimes , much less in a church during the glorious fading days of August . Continues ...
