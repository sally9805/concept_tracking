Joe Mansueto does n't look like a wild man . <p> He 's a youthful-looking 52 , soft-spoken , with a ready smile . He does n't act like a wild man , either . " I 've worked for him for 20 years , and I 've never heard him raise his voice , " says Don Phillips , managing director at Morningstar . <p> Still , you have to wonder . Stock in the company he founded , Morningstar , is down more than 50% the past 12 months . The financial industry is reeling . Media companies are getting clobbered . Mansueto runs a media company that specializes in the financial-services industry . But Morningstar has been on a buying spree , snapping up six companies in a year , including one that follows South African mutual funds . " It 's our first presence on the African continent , " Mansueto says , with pride . <p> Those who have followed his career are n't surprised . " It 's a tough time in financial services and the media , but it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's takes a long-term view when everyone else is taking a short-term view . " <p> And , in fact , behind Mansueto 's quiet Midwestern manners is one of the nation 's boldest entrepreneurs . Mansueto started Morningstar in 1984 with $80,000 when he was 27 years old , going up against fund-tracking services that had been in business since the 1940s . <p> Morningstar had one big advantage over its rivals : It aimed its services at consumers in a format that was easy to use and understand . The Morningstar style box , which let investors know a fund 's investment strategy at a glance , has become iconic  --  as has Morningstar 's own logo , which Mansueto paid legendary designer Paul Rand $50,000 to create . And Mansueto pushed the company hard to invest in technology , which meant it was offering computerized databases when other companies were still printing monthly newsletters . <p> Analysts are definitely staying busy <p> Today , Morningstar is a $1.3 billion company with operations in 19 countries and sales of $501 million . The Chicago-based investment-tracking company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts , and sells its data to individuals , financial advisers and institutions . Not content with running Morningstar , Mansueto formed Mansueto Ventures in 2005 and bought Inc. magazine , which focuses on small businesses , and Fast Company , a magazine devoted to the stock market . <p> No doubt about it , the current market has been tough for Morningstar and its subscribers . " We have been so used to upward trends for the last couple decades , " Mansueto says . " But my generation has never seen losses like this . In 1973-1974 I was in high school . This is the biggest downturn of my career . " <p> The number of people who pay for Morningstar 's premium services has fallen modestly , Mansueto says , but Morningstar.com is still one of the largest paid sites on the Internet . Mansueto was wild enough to diversify Morningstar 's business from just consumers , targeting financial advisers and institutions . And in a bear market , individual investors seek the help of financial advisers . " They have earned their keep this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with the materials they need so they can handle all the business . " <p> In a time when nearly every financial institution has been laying off financial analysts , Morningstar has been beefing up its staff . " We have the largest independent analytical staff in the world , " Mansueto says . " We 've ramped up the European fund analysts to 25 , and are trying to build to the same level of coverage in Europe that we have in the U.S. " <p> In short , when the great financial institutions have been selling , wild man Mansueto has been buying . The purchase most familiar to most investors : 10k Wizard , a website that offers searchable Securities and Exchange Commission filings . <p> But Mansueto has also added to Morningstar 's formidable database operations , which include Ibbotson Associates , a respected Chicago research corporation . " We purchased Tenfore Systems , a U.K. company that supplies real-time price quotes from 160 sources around the world , " Mansueto says . " There 's a very large market , about $1 billion in size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about getting involved in that . " <p> Growing and taking care of its staff <p> All told , Morningstar has spent $104 million in the past 12 months buying businesses that fit its operations . And , Mansueto says , not all of them were rock-bottom bargains , despite the ruined financial landscape . " Valuations have come down a bit , " Mansueto says . " But private companies tend not to sell if it 's not a fair value to their mind . " They can wait for better times . <p> And in an era when companies are slicing benefits and reducing salaries to a fistful of boiled gravel , Morningstar is famously kind to its employees , who get free soft drinks and a paid six-week sabbatical every four years . " If you look around the offices , it 's a pretty egalitarian setup , " Phillips says . " Joe does n't have this big suite of offices , and his desk is the same size as everyone else 's . " Mansueto , who has expensive holdings of Morningstar stock , draws a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't provide bond ratings , it stands in good position to benefit from the woes of other analytical firms , such as Standard &amp; Poor 's , which have come under fire for not being critical enough in their evaluation of mortgage-backed securities . " Our bright line of distinction is that other companies have embraced the pay-for-ratings model , but Morningstar is truly independent , " Mansueto says . " No company pays us to cover them ; no company commissions research . Users pay for licensing fees to use our research after we have created it . " <p> Indeed , Morningstar 's reputation for tough , independent-minded research has led to invitations to testify before Congress on the effect of fees on mutual fund performance , as well as the 2003 mutual fund trading scandal . <p> Despite Morningstar 's activism , however , Mansueto remains a devotee of the free markets . " I 'm skeptical of government intervention , " he says . " As Steve Forbes said , if government spending were the path to prosperity , then the Soviet Union would have won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prosperity , Mansueto is sticking to a not-so-wild idea : focusing on helping investors . " We 're not going to expand to other areas outside of investing , " he says . <p> And he expects to push abroad . Morningstar gets about 20% of its revenue from overseas , but half of all investible assets are abroad , he says . " We 're going to let a very investor-centric strategy guide us , " Mansueto says . <p> He also sees Morningstar integrating its new databases into existing platforms . For example , he 's considering adding bond data to Morningstar 's offerings . " Investors would like to track it , " he says . In other words , he wants to give customers more for their money , not less . Why , that 's just crazy talk .
