That 's on thing I wuld like my work to embody . HARLAN BUTT OVER A 30-YEAR CAREER , THE TEXAS METALSMITH HARLAN BUTT HAS earned international renown for his exquisite vessels-enamel writing boxes , vases , tea caddies and chalices . Yet , in the hands of this driven and philosophical artist , such ostensible " containers " turn outto be vehicles , too , conveyances of surprise , allusion and questioning . An artfully arranged vase of flowers is actually sculpture , its brass blossoms permanent , its stems sealed tight . What first appears a simple decorative inscription around the edge of an incense burner- " Metamorphosis . .. Transformation ... Metamorphosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Devour . .. Transformation . " The trance is broken : we see with a snakes eyes and weave toward an unsuspecting frog . Butt has worked to keep " mastery " ever out in front , continually deepening his ambitions . Through the years he has incorporated diverse art and craft traditions into his metalwork-enameling , poetry , ikebana ( Japanese flower arranging ) , scroll painting and even gardening-each development unfolding in accord with a spiritual discipline : his practice often Buddhism . Thus can he say , with conviction , " It 's my ideas that make my art unique , not the technique . I can share the technique with anyone . " It is these ideas that speak , cinch and burst through the sensuous forms of his works . Growing up in Hopewell , New Jersey , and graduating from the hothouse high school in nearby Princeton , Butt showed early promise as an artist . The first of his family to attend college , he chose the Tyler School ofArt outside Philadelphia and , in the exciting , expansionist years of contemporary crafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnishing of competition . " I was supposedly good at art , but you were n't special there , " Butt says . " You had to make your own mark . " At Tyler , Butt met Robin Weber , a painter , whom he married in 1972 . Under professors Stanley Lechtzin and Elliott Pujol , he entered the highly structured metals program and , with their encouragement , moved on to graduate study at Southern Illinois University . Butt found Carbondale " a lot freer , a more relaxed atmosphere , " and building on strong fundamentals , he could make the most of liberty . Brent Kington , his major professor , advocated " more of a personal search . He was an example , somebody who was always working . " That ethic has been one hallmark of Butt 's career . And that search , beginning in a struggle with materials , has led the metalsmith inward , toward the ceremonial source of craft . Pieces from as early as 1975 show a complex , reverential approach to vessel making . Finding a dead hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull , an ornate reliquary and lamp of beveled steel over brass , an object nearly Romanesque in its grave mood and design . He was drawn to aboriginal cultures , in which craft serves ritual ends . A bracelet made during this period combines an owl 's claw , squirrel 's foot and lizard 's head with copper and steel , a fierce accessory fit for The Road Warrior . In 1976 Butt joined the faculty of the University of North Texas , Demon , 40 miles north of Dallas , and has headed its metalsmithing program ever since-Today , his courses mix out-on-a-limb theoretical questions with practical problems . Butt is completely at ease in both realms . Students in his graduate metals course mull " which came first , the sculpture or the pedestal ? " and " what makes a non-table ? " until he brings discussion to a close . " Your future could hinge on this demonstration , " he chuckles . The students take notes as Butt sketches the pivot lines ofa metal fastener , drawing near to watch how a masterfiles , fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Carbondale , Butt sought to add color , " its visual and emotional impact , " to his metalwork . By chance he came upon a dusty cabinet of enamels and began some go-it-alone experiments . None of Butt 's professors had any interest or expertise in enameling , but he began working with the material anyway . At first " I was really frustrated with it , trying to solder things and put them in the kiln , " he remembers . " They were falling apart . " It was five years later , at North Texas , that a student who had studied with the jeweler and enamelist William Harper in Florida revived Butt 's interest in melting powdered glass onto copper and silver . During spring break in 1979 , Butt headed west to Big Bend , Texas 's immense national park , a place of staggering quiet , huge vistas and arid mountains . Setting up a tripod , he photographed the four compass points hourly from sunrise to sunset , keeping a journal . Out of this retreat , he produced four Reflexive Landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poetry . In these pieces , and many that have followed , Butt achieves a craft of intimate discovery , objects that lead from eye , to fingers , to the less accessible realm of the mind . With his Midday Cup , texture and color draw us closer . Taken in hand , the cup , we find , contains a skeletal branch of ocotillo fixed inside . Closer still , we find a poetic fragment from his noon notebook , half-hidden around the rim . With this process of gentle attraction , a provocation of curiosity and aesthetic desire , Butt came upon an idea both suspenseful and capacious . He 's been exploring it ever since . Some of his most compelling works of this kind are natsume , or tea containers , Butt made in the early-i98os , at the time of his second visit to Japan . With these pieces , a series entitled looi Views of Mt . Mu , Butt made new a traditional article used in the tea ceremony and typically rendered in lacquered wood . He produced a series of small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a different optical suggestion : swirling thumbprint , streak of smoke , brocade of nandina leaves . For many of them Butt fashioned a second , interior lid inscribed with a koan-like poem , and , moving ever inward , tucked another image in , like a secret one must intuit , then find . In View#5 of the series , a lunar blue container is delicately encircled with ribbed lines . Opening it , we read , " On the paper lantern , A moth in desperation , Betrayed by a false moon . " Removing this inner lid and turning it over , we find a moth , clinging to the underside . Such penetrations of the visible world lead through sensation , to frustration or wonder , and then to a vibrant stillness . Butt calls this quality " emptiness . " " That 's an aspect of reality that 's missing , " in much contemporary life , he says . " We fill everything up , with things , activities . Anytime we 're not doing something it 's boring . But really all there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His Wisteria series from the Late 1980s evokes this idea , too , with undulant steel " vines " that wrap and reach beyond elegant enamel vases . Their exuberance seems both constricting and playful , straining across the vessels ' gleaming bodies . From their barrenness something coils , promising to spring out . Three visits to Asia affirmed Butt 's Buddhist leanings and helped him , he says , " break through basic preconceptions . " On his first trip , he visited potters , kimono painters and iron casters around Honshu . In Kyoto he befriended the owner ofa metals gallery and learned that members of the local guild wanted some way to show their pieces in the United States . Impressed by the work he encountered , Butt curated " Kyoto Metal , " an exhibition of contemporary pieces that toured this country in 1983 and ' ' 84 . He returned to Kyoto in 1984 determined to work . At one local company , he honed his skills at cloisonne , using ribbons of metal wire to frame and decorate with enamels . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rigors of ) apanese craft apprenticeship , sitting for hours on the floor to raise a bowl and suffering the ridicule of a head apprentice who mocked his working methods . " No real criticism of my technique had ever been voiced before , " Butt wrote in Metalsmith ( Spring 1987 ) , " but then , that might have been for lack of demanding and knowledgeable critics . " Butt 's pieces have been acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston , and the Mint Museum of Craft+Design in Charlotte . He was president of the i , ioo-member Enamelist Society ( 1998,1999 ) and , among other activities , is organizing an exhibition for the Indian Conference on Enameling , to take place next year in New Delhi . Through his efforts the Denton Zen Group was formed in 1991 . Despite these achievements , Butt 's harshest critic lives in his own mind ; as he wrote and inscribed on an incense burner , " Abandoned by despair and joy / Not unsatisfied and yet / Something still is missing . " Such restlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student often . " Buddhism has been sometimes seen as a negative philosophy . I think that 's a misconception , " he says . " It 's like mountains coming through clouds . You just see the tips of mountains . It 's not that there 's nothing there . It 's that the only thing you see is infinite potential . That 's one thing 1 would like my work to embody . " And many pieces do . Works from his most recent series of incense burners , entitled Earth Beneath Our Feet , show a dense and intricate " landscape " wriggling right where we 're standing : twigs , lizards , nuts and leaves are busy , a minute world , whole and alive . His Garden Anagogies , fruitlike and rootlike enamel forms , send up shoots of brass , an effect at once erotic , comic , puzzling and powerful . What meets the eye is dazzling , but there 's more .
