Broken Brains and Fix-It Drugs " Selling Sanity Through Gender , " by Dr. Jonathan M. Metzl ( Fall 2003 ) , highlights only one aspect of how women are targeted as mentally ill . The drug companies could not sell drugs unless there were diseases to treat . Objective evidence is the basis of criteria for defining diseases in all branches of medicine , except psychiatry . The criteria for mental illnesses are arrived at by vote , by ( mostly male ) members of the American Psychiatric Association . Since women are disproportionately diagnosed as mentally ill , this means that women suffer so-called broken brains more than men . Of course , this is ridiculous . The medical model of mental life is reductive and simplistic , and is a danger to us all . DANIEL DORMAN , M.D. ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE LOS ANGELES , CA Global Perspective Thank you for your excellent and timely leader ( " Winning the Peace , " Fall 2003 ) on the importance of positive involvement in post-conflict Afghanistan and Iraq . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past views on recent wars , come together to support positive change in this region . As your magazine rightly notes , the role of women is pivotal in this work . As a combat veteran of Desert Storm who also has supported our recent military campaigns against the Taliban and the Ba'ath party , I see our victories over those regimes as an opportunity to improve the lives and the futures of millions of people . But the hardest part , and the most important , lies ahead . Humanitarian aid and continuing security commitments will require our fullest support . Thank you for encouraging your readers to stay involved in the reconstruction process in Afghanistan and Iraq . Your " progress reports " on these countries are very valuable . Please keep them in the forefront of the magazine 's coverage . I simply can not overstate how important I think this is . Keep up the good work . ASHER ABRAMS PORTLAND , OR That Photograph The photograph of the young Iraqi girl killed by a cluster bomb ( Global News , Fall 2003 ) was devastating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If people would like to apply pressure to end the use of cluster bombs , and advocate on other issues , they may want to consider utilizing AM talk radio . It 's surprisingly easy to get through to both local and national programs and interrupt reactionary patterns of thought . Some right-wing hosts , like Michael Medved , welcome dissenting callers . And there are a few pioneering female talk show hosts , like Enid Goldstein on KNRC , Randi Rhodes on WJNO , Erin Hart on KIRO , Laura Flanders on KWAB and Nancy Skinner on ieamericaradio.com , who would love to hear from readers of Ms. magazine . Many programs can be streamed on the Net , and have massive audiences that include elected officials and media professionals . Now that America 's Humpty Dumpty ( Rush Limbaugh ) has had his big fall , it 's a good time to join a growing movement for a more balanced discussion on the airwaves of talk radio . PRESTON ENRIGHT DENVER , CO Queen Noor I was thrilled to see Jordan 's Queen Noor on the cover of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent , it is heartening to see Queen Noor 's integrity , passion and commitment to peace celebrated in this country . However , I was thoroughly dismayed to see a profile of Golda Meir in the segment Touching History . Meir 's legacy , one summarized in her now-infamous statement , " The Palestinians ? Who are they ? " lies at the root of current Israeli policy toward the Palestinian people . Her mark upon history is stained with the blood of thousands , both Israeli and Palestinian . In the midst of that disappointment , I realized the significance of the choice to feature Queen Noor in the cover story . Her belief , and that of numerous Palestinians and Israelis , that peace and justice are indeed attainable , will live on long after that expressed by Meir . ROULA SEIKALY SALT LAKE CITY , UT More Queen Noor I , along with many others , will remember Golda Meir-this was the same woman who , as Israeli prime minister , made the abhorrent declaration , " There is no such thing as a Palestinian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and right to existence of any people , is putting a blight on all humankind ! And it is indeed ironic that this is featured in the same issue with Queen Noor of Jordan , who is championing human rights for women in the Middle East and for all peoples ! DR . ERNA LUND SEATTLE , WA Love the mag . I really would like to know where Queen Noor purchased the top she is wearing on the cover . Thanks . JOYCE MESSINA VIA E-MAIL // <p>
