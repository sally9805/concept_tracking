NASA computer simulations have predicted that asteroid 1950 DA may strike Earth in the year 2880 ( the approach depicted here by a composite image of Eros and Earth ) . NASA/GSFC // Asteroid 1950 DA might collide with Earth goo years from now . But already this object 's peculiar orbit is giving planetary scientists a new way to study and possibly deflect such troublesome space rocks . IT WAS MARCH 4 , 2001 . JON GIORGINI DID N'T REALLY EXPECT ANYTHING SPECIAL from that day 's observations . Asteroid 1950 DA was not even the main objective . It was a last-minute target of opportunity , added when the observers realized it would come within reach of radar from the Goldstone and Arecibo radio telescopes . So when Giorgini , a radar astronomer at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , sat down at his computer to examine the new data , he had no idea what lay ahead . * Detailed radar observations of potential Earth-threatening asteroids are crucial for calculating their orbital trajectories . Fortunately , this radio data usually makes any whiff of risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - go away . Unfortunately , some near-Earth asteroids pass where planetary radar can lock onto them . ( In the case of 1950 DA , however , calculations had already ruled out the possibility of an impact anytime in the next century . Still , planetary scientists do n't like to pass up radar observations of near-Earth asteroids because such opportunities are relatively rare . Also , radar is the only way short of a big-budget spacecraft mission to detail an asteroid 's size and shape . So as soon as the first data came in , Giorgini immediately went to work . A ROCKY FUTURE Radar data quickly gave a precise position and motion for 1950 DA , within an accuracy of better than 0.6 miles ( 1 km ) in location and 1.5 inches ( 3.5 cm ) per second in speed . Giorgini then used an orbit-prediction computer program to see how far into the future such forecasts could go before degenerating into chaos . He knew from experience that no predictions work for more than about a century ahead . * But as the figures began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw astonished him . The table of possible encounters marched forward century after century . Way out in 2641 , the uncertainty was still only a couple of Earth-diameters wide - an absurdly small figure for such a long timespan . And then , barely hours after the first radar echoes bounced back into the Goldstone dish , came the clincher : March 16 , 2880 , a date during which 1950 DA could slam into Earth . The probability was 1 in 300 - far higher than any impact prediction ever made . How quickly Giorgini learned not to forget this space rock . Previous radar readings had always eliminated the possibility of 1950 DA impacting Earth . This time , however , a collision was more likely . Worse , if it did happen , the asteroid would surely cause widespread devastation . At roughly three quarters of a mile ( 1.1 km ) across , 1950 DA is big enough to cause immense damage . Such an impact would directly destroy an area the size of Wisconsin , spread wildfires across an entire continent , and cause dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine centuries away , the prospect would be downright terrifying . OUT OF THE NIGHT Asteroid 1950 DA was discovered on February 23 , 1950 , and it was then observed and photographed for 17 days before being lost . It stayed lost for a full half-century before helping to ring in the New Year on December 31 , 2000 , when it showed up in an asteroid discovery program at Lowell Observatory . The space rock was designated 2000 YK66. 1950 DAs return was unexpected since the original observations were inadequate for prediction . On the discovery night , Conrad Bardwell was manning the Minor Planet Center at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Massachusetts . An astronomer emeritus , Bardwell was around for the asteroid 's initial discovery , and he has remained interested in it ever since . He saw the coordinates for 2000 YK66 and within just two hours had figured out this new object was actually the long-lost 1950 DA . The 50-year baseline of observations provides a rare amount of precision in determining 1950 DAs orbital path . Only a handful of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long timeline nor the radar 's precision measurements can explain why 1950 DAs orbit is predictable so far into the future . The unique predictability of 1950 DA hinges on something completely unexpected - a new discovery , which Giorgini and 14 collaborators reported in the journal Science for April 5 , 2002 . The secret of 1950 DAs predictability lies in what scientists call a resonant orbit . GETTING IN THE SWING It turns out that 1950 DA has an 11-to-5 orbital resonance with Earth . Translated into everyday language , that means every time 1950 DA makes five complete circuits around the Sun , the Earth makes exactly 11 orbits . Thus Earth and the asteroid return to virtually the same relative positions every 11 years . Such resonances are well known among the solar systems moons , but nobody had anticipated the effect of such a synchronized minuet on the long-term evolution of an asteroid 's orbit . The effect is rather dramatic and had never been predicted by theorists . Partnership in a resonant orbit greatly reduces uncertainty of an asteroid 's future orbit , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it every which way . If it gets pulled a little forward in its orbit , resonance acts to draw it back . Every time perturbations start to drag it backward , Earth 's attraction pulls it forward . Thus 1950 DA can never stray far from its mean orbital solution . Photograph Asteroid 1950 DA imaged using radar with the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico on March 3-7 , 2001 . At the time , the asteroid was 13 million miles from Earth . Steven Ostro ( JPL ) In this montage , asteroids Eros ( top ) and Mathilde ( bottom ) are shown at the same scale as imaged by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft . Mathilde 's brightness is exaggerated for viewing purposes- it 's actually six times darker than Eros with about the same reflectivity as soot . NASA // Giorgini and his colleagues used a standard computer simulation for 1950 DAs orbital evolution , tracking instead 10,000 virtual asteroids . After a few decades of computer-modeling time , such simulations usually show a chaotic spread in possible orbits , rendering them worthless for predictions . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of orbit solutions started to grow uncertain , it pinched back down again . After 600 years , the region of uncertainty in the asteroid 's position was still only 12,500 miles ( 20,000 km ) long - less than twice Earth 's diameter . Then in 2641 , " that resonance is disrupted , if not broken , " says Giorgini . A close encounter with Earth , although it will not produce a collision , does alter the resonant relationship forever . " The uncertainty is confined for 600 years , and then it very quickly spreads out to a region of several million miles , " he says . Much of the asteroid 's positional uncertainty comes at the end of the calculation period . By then it has built up to an 18 million-mile swath , following further close brushes with Earth in 2809 and 2860 . The latter date is just 20 years before the potential Earth impact . PLUS OR MINUS The preliminary calculations revealed both an incredibly long period of stability and high odds of a collision . So Giorgini and his JPL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with asteroid radar pioneer Steve Ostro , decided to use 1950 DA as a test case . They would examine every kind of force , effect , and phenomenon that could conceivably change the terrifying outcome . For 1950 DA , virtually all uncertainty lies along its orbital path . This means that the asteroid 's orbit almost certainly will intersect Earth 's orbit on March 16 , 2880 . But the vitally important question is , will the asteroid and Earth arrive at the same point at the same time ? There is a 20-minute window in 1950 DAs " nominal " orbital track that could lead to an impact . A wide variety of effects could nudge the asteroid 's position backward or forward between now and then . These effects include the gravitational pull of asteroids and galactic tides , the push of solar wind and radiation pressure , the oblateness of the Sun 's shape , uncertainties in the masses of the planets , and effects from the reradiation of solar energy . How much could these alter the likelihood of an asteroid-induced Doomsday for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perturbations not only by all the planets , but also from a mind-boggling 7,196 asteroids - actually , every asteroid known to be larger than 6.2 miles ( 10 km ) in diameter . Of these , 2,051 were found to produce a total of 28,199 approaches to 1950 DA over the next 880 years . The cumulative effect of all these was a net change of just over a day in the orbital position in 2880 - they retard its arrival by 1.2 days . Then the team looked at variations in the Sun 's shape from the idealized sphere used in basic orbit computations . A slightly out-of-plane orbit like 1950 DAs - inclined 12 ' from Earth 's - makes a subtle difference and can actually have a noticeable effect . It could add an uncertainty of about 70 minutes to its orbital position . The effects of the solar wind and radiation pressure on the orbit were much bigger - a total retardation of arrival time by 9.1 days . The uncertainties in the mass determinations of the planets add a possible uncertainty of 2.4 days ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects such as galactic tides , mathematical errors because of rounding in the computers , and the loss of mass by the Sun , produced a tiny cumulative net effect of -6 minutes . THE WHAT EFFECT ? But the biggest effect , the one whose uncertainties make it impossible to refine the impact odds for the foreseeable future , is one that most people had never even heard of until 1950 DA came along - the Yarkovsky effect ( well-known among spacecraft engineers , however . ) Named for an obscure Russian civil engineer who discovered it around 1900 , the Yarkovsky effect ordinarily concerns only small , easily deflected bodies like spacecraft . In the last few years , however , planetary scientists have begun to consider that this odd , tiny effect could also make a difference to relatively massive bodies like asteroids . What is the Yarkovsky effect ? It 's a minuscule impulse provided by the re-radiation of absorbed solar heat by a spinning body . The magnitude of the impulse depends on the asteroid 's spin rate and orientation , its surface composition and shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are known very precisely in the case of 1950 DA . Re-radiated heat acts like a tiny rocket thruster , but whether the force pushes or pulls the asteroid depends on the orientation of its axis relative to its orbit . The Yarkovsky effect is certainly subtle . But over the course of centuries , it may make a big difference in what happens on that fateful day just before spring arrives in 2880 . This one effect alone could change the arrival time by almost 10 days forward or nearly two months ( 57.7 days ) backward . In all , it accounts for about 68 days of additional uncertainty . HEADS OR TAILS The key factor determining how the Yarkovsky effect will alter 1950 DA 's future ( and ours ) depends on the asteroid 's rotation . Literally , it 's a coin-toss . Radar observations yield two sets of possible solutions for the asteroid 's spin axis . If it spins one way , we 're stuck with those 1 - in- 300 odds . If the spin axis goes the other way , the odds of impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the axis being one way or the other , a flip of the coin may determine the threat . Just how is 1950 DA oriented in space ? Absent an expensive spacecraft mission or some clever new ground-based technique , the next opportunities to learn more about the asteroid 's spin lie a long way off . Radar observations could nail down the spin axis , but the next opportunity does n't come until 2032 and that approach is actually more distant than the one in 2001 . Another , still more distant , chance comes in 2074 . Not until 2105 will 1950 DA approach closer than in 2001 . But if the Yarkovsky effect befuddles our current attempts at prediction , it could also end up being our savior in the event that this asteroid really does have a date with the Earth in 2880 . What re-radiation can cause , it can also undo . If it turns out that we 're on a collision course , all we need to do is alter one or more of the physical parameters controlling 1950 DA 's Yarkovsky effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of checking and double checking . Among the factors that control the Yarkovsky effect , changing the spin of a kilometer-wide asteroid is not practical , and changing its composition is out of the question entirely . But reflectivity has a significant effect , and might be relatively easy to alter . A dark surface might be brightened by dumping loads of chalk or ice crystals on it , or covering the asteroid in a huge , reflective Mylar sheet - just like a baked potato wrapped in tinfoil . If 1950 DA has a bright surface ( perhaps from a layer of ice ) then we could darken it with loads of charcoal dust or soot . Or we might selectively darken some parts and lighten others . These techniques wo n't go wasted . Even if 1950 DA turns out to be benign after all , harnessing the Yarkovsky effect may some day help steer other errant asteroids out of our way . THINKING LONG TERM 1950 DA has taught planetary scientists enough to give this orbiting mountain a unique place in the annals of space science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face as residents of a solar system that 's still evolving . Like the proverbial sword of Damocles , 1950 DA will probably loom over humanity for decades , a constant threat to our civilization . Its threat , in fact , could remain unresolved even for centuries . " This one is n't going to go away , " says Brian Marsden , director of the Minor Planet Center . This extraordinary object , the likeliest impactor and the most predictable asteroid yet discovered , will remain a major focus of small-body research for a long time . If an imminent collision course is real , we 'll have our work cut out for us . The process of devising a plan , and carrying out the first rescue of our world from a devastating blow from above , could be a project that prods human consciousness for much of the millennium to come . It 's no wonder then that Giorgini calls 1950 DA " an asteroid for the millennium .
