Torak woke with a jolt from a sleep he 'd never meant to have . The fire had burned low . He crouched in the fragile shell of light and peered into the looming blackness of the Forest . He could n't see anything . Could n't hear anything . Had it come back ? Was it out there now , watching him with its hot , murderous eyes ? He felt hollow and cold . He knew that he badly needed food , and that his arm hurt , and his eyes were scratchy with tiredness , but he could n't really feel it . All night he 'd guarded the wreck of the spruce bough shelter and watched his father bleed . How could this be happening ? Only yesterday  --  yesterday  --  they 'd pitched camp in the blue autumn dusk . Torak had made a joke , and his father was laughing . Then the Forest exploded . Ravens screamed . Pines cracked . And out of the dark beneath the trees surged a deeper darkness : a huge rampaging menace in bear form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claws . A welter of sound to make the ears bleed . In a heartbeat , the creature had smashed their shelter to splinters . In a heartbeat , it had ripped a ragged wound in his father 's side . Then it was gone , melting into the Forest as silently as mist . But what kind of bear stalks men  --  then vanishes without making the kill ? What kind of bear plays with its prey ? And where was it now ? Torak could n't see beyond the firelight , but he knew that the clearing , too , was a wreck of snapped saplings and trampled bracken . He smelled pine-blood and clawed earth . He heard the soft , sad bubbling of the stream thirty paces away . The bear could be anywhere . Beside him , his father moaned . Slowly he opened his eyes and looked at his son without recognition . Torak 's heart clenched . " Fa , it  --  it 's me , " he stammered . " How do you feel ? " Pain convulsed his father 's lean brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clan-tattoos stand out lividly . Sweat matted his long dark hair . His wound was so deep that as Torak clumsily stanched it with beard-moss , he saw his father 's guts glistening in the firelight . He had to grit his teeth to keep from retching . He hoped Fa did n't notice  --  but of course he did . Fa was a hunter . He noticed everything . " Torak ... " he breathed . His hand reached out , his hot fingers clinging to Torak 's as eagerly as a child . Torak swallowed . Sons clutch their fathers ' hands , not the other way around . He tried to be practical : to be a man instead of a boy . " I 've still got some yarrow leaves , " he said , fumbling for his medicine pouch with his free hand . " Maybe that 'll stop the --  " " Keep it . You 're bleeding too . " " Does n't hurt , " lied Torak . The bear had thrown him against a birch tree , bruising his ribs and gashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before it comes back . " Torak stared at him . He opened his mouth but no sound came . " You must , " said his father . " No . No . I can't --  " " Torak  --  I 'm dying . I 'll be dead by sunrise . " Torak gripped the medicine pouch . There was a roaring in his ears . " Fa --  " " Give me  --  what I need for the Death Journey . Then get your things . " The Death Journey . No . No . But his father 's face was stern . " My bow , " he said . " Three arrows . You  --  keep the rest . Where I 'm going  --  hunting 's easy . " There was a tear in the knee of Torak 's buckskin leggings . He dug his thumbnail into the flesh . It hurt . He forced himself to concentrate on that . " Food , " gasped his father . " The dried meat . You  --  take it all . " Torak 's knee had started to bleed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father on the Death Journey . He tried not to picture himself alone in the Forest . He was only twelve summers old . He could n't survive on his own . He did n't know how . " Torak ! Move ! " Blinking furiously , Torak reached for his father 's weapons and laid them by his side . He divided up the arrows , pricking his fingers on the sharp flint points . Then he shouldered his quiver and bow and scrabbled in the wreckage for his small black basalt axe . His hazelwood pack had been smashed in the attack ; he 'd have to cram everything else into his jerkin , or tie it to his belt . He reached for his reindeer-hide sleeping sack . " Take mine , " murmured his father . " You never did  --  repair yours . And  --  swap knives . " Torak was aghast . " Not your knife ! You 'll need it ! " " You 'll need it more . And  --  it 'll be good to have something of yours on the Death-Journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Forest , a twig snapped . Torak spun round . Nothing . Just the crackle of the fire and the thud of his heart . His father licked the sweat from his lips . " It 's not here yet , " he said . " Soon . It will come for me soon .... Quick . The knives . " Clenching his jaw so hard that it hurt , Torak took his own knife and put it into Fa 's hand . Then he untied the buckskin sheath from his father 's belt . Fa 's knife was beautiful and deadly , with a blade of banded blue slate shaped like a willow leaf , and a haft of red deer antler that was bound with elk sinew for a better grip . As Torak looked down at it , the truth hit him . He was getting ready for a life without Fa . " I 'm not leaving you ! " he cried . " I 'll fight it , I --  " " No ! No one can fight this bear ! " Ravens flew up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father . " A bear  --  any bear  --  is the strongest hunter in the Forest . You know that . But this bear  --  much stronger . " Torak felt the hairs on his arms rise . Looking down into his father 's eyes , he saw the tiny scarlet veins and , at the centers , the fathomless dark . " What do you mean ? " he whispered . " It is  --  possessed . " His father 's face was grim ; he did n't seem like Fa anymore . " Some  --  demon  --  from the Otherworld  --  has entered it and made it evil . " An ember spat . The dark trees leaned closer to listen . " A demon ? " said Torak . His father shut his eyes , mustering his strength . " It lives only to kill , " he said at last . " With each kill  --  its power will grow . It will slaughter  --  everything . The prey . The clans . All will die . The Forest will die ... " He broke off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . The demon  --  too strong . " " One moon ? But what --  " " Think , Torak ! When the red eye is highest in the night sky , that 's when demons are strongest . You know this . That 's when the bear will be  --  invincible . " He fought for breath . In the firelight , Torak saw the pulse beating in his throat . So faint : as if it might stop at any moment . " I need you  --  to swear something , " said Fa . " Anything . " Fa swallowed . " Head north . Many daywalks . Find  --  the Mountain  --  of the World Spirit . " Torak stared at him . What ? His father 's eyes opened , and he gazed into the branches overhead , as if he saw things there that no one else could . " Find it , " he said again . " It 's the only hope . " " But  --  no one 's ever found it . No one can . " " You can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  will find you . " Torak was bewildered . Never before had his father talked like this . He was a practical man ; a hunter . " I do n't understand any of this ! " he cried . " What guide ? Why must I find the Mountain ? Will I be safe there ? Is that it ? Safe from the bear ? " Slowly , Fa 's gaze left the sky and came to rest on his son 's face . He looked as if he was wondering how much more Torak could take . " Ah , you 're too young , " he said . " I thought I had more time . So much I have n't told you . Don't-do n't hate me for that later . " Torak looked at him in horror . Then he leaped to his feet . " I ca n't do this on my own . Should n't I try to find --  " " No ! " said his father with startling force . " All your life I 've kept you apart . Even  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If they find out-what you can do ... " " What do you mean ? I don't --  " " No time , " his father cut in . " Now swear . On my knife . Swear that you will find the Mountain , or die trying . " Torak bit his lip hard . East through the trees , a gray light was growing . Not yet , he thought in panic . Please not yet . " Swear , " hissed his father . Torak knelt and picked up the knife . It was heavy : a man 's knife , too big for him . Awkwardly he touched it to the wound on his forearm . Then he put it to his shoulder , where the strip of wolf fur , his clan-creature , was sewn to his jerkin . In an unsteady voice he took his oath . " I swear , by my blood on this blade , and by each of my three souls  --  that I will find the Mountain of the World Spirit . Or die trying . " His father breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Death Marks on me . Hurry . The bear  --  not far off . " Torak felt the salty sting of tears . Angrily he brushed them away . " I have n't got any ochre , " he mumbled . " Take  --  mine . " In a blur , Torak found the little antler-tine medicine horn that had been his mother 's . In a blur , he yanked out the black oak stopper , and shook some of the red ochre into his palm . Suddenly he stopped . " I ca n't . " " You can . For me . " Torak spat into his palm and made a sticky paste of the ochre , the dark-red blood of the earth , then he drew the small circles on his father 's skin that would help the souls recognize each other and stay together after death . First , as gently as he could , he removed his father 's beaver-hide boots and drew a circle on each heel , to mark the name-soul . Then he drew another circle over the heart , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's chest was scarred from an old wound , so Torak managed only a lopsided oval . He hoped that would be good enough . Last , he made the most important mark of all : a circle on the forehead to mark the Nanuak , the world-soul . By the time he 'd finished , he was swallowing tears . " Better , " murmured his father . But Torak saw with a clutch of terror that the pulse in his throat was fainter . " Fa , I 'm not leaving you , I --  " " Torak . You swore an oath . " Again he closed his eyes . " Now . You  --  keep the medicine horn . I do n't need it anymore . Take your things . Fetch me water from the river . Then  --  go . " I will not cry , Torak told himself as he rolled up his father 's sleeping sack and tied it across his back ; jammed his axe into his belt ; stuffed his medicine pouch into his jerkin . He got to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shreds . He 'd have to bring water in a dock leaf . He was about to go when his father murmured his name . Torak turned . " Yes , Fa ? " " Remember . When you 're hunting , look behind you . I  --  always tell you . " He forced a smile . " You always  --  forget . Look behind you . Yes ? " Torak nodded . He tried to smile back . Then he blundered through the wet bracken toward the stream . The light was growing , and the air smelled fresh and sweet . Around him the trees were bleeding : oozing golden pine-blood from the slashes the bear had inflicted . Some of the tree-spirits were moaning quietly in the dawn breeze . Torak reached the stream . Glancing quickly around , he snatched a dock leaf and moved forward , his boots sinking into the soft red mud . He froze . Beside his right boot was the track of a bear . A front paw : twice the size of his own head , and so fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious claws had bitten deep into the mud . Look behind you , Torak . He spun round . Willows . Alder . Fir . Dark yew . Dripping spruce . Dense . Impenetrable . But deep within  --  no more than ten paces away  --  a stir of branches . Something was in there . Something huge . Torak forced himself to stay still . Do n't run . Do n't run . Maybe it does n't know you 're here . A low hiss . Again the branches stirred . He heard the stealthy rustle as the creature moved toward the shelter : toward his father . He waited in rigid silence as it passed . Coward ! he shouted inside his head . You let it go without even trying to save Fa ! But what could you do ? said the small part of his mind that could still think straight . Fa knew this would happen . That 's why he sent you for water . He knew it was coming for him .... " Torak ! " came his father 's wild cry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar shook the Forest  --  on and on till Torak 's head was splitting . " Fa ! " he screamed . " Run ! " Again the Forest shook . Again came his father 's cry . Then suddenly it broke off . Through the trees , he glimpsed a great dark shadow in the wreck of the shelter . He turned and ran .
