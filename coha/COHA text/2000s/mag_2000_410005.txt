Dear Dr. Cory : Why do some people have birthmarks ? Kallee Travis Prescott , Ontario , Canada Dear Kailee : Birthmarks are on your body when you are born.That is why they are called " birthmarks . " They appear in many colors , from light pink to dark brown or black . Doctors do not know what causes them , and no one has discovered a way to prevent them from appearing . Some people do n't have any , while others may have several . Birthmarks usually grow as the child grows and do not cause any problems . However , large , dark brown or black birthmarks can be more serious . They may be as small as a halfdollar , or so large that they cover an arm or leg . Not many people have these types of birthmarks . But those who do should be checked by a dermatologist or skin doctor . Although uncommon , these birthmarks are more likely than smaller ones to turn into a serious type of skin cancer . One type of birthmark , called a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or purplish color . This is caused by a large number of blood vessels in one area just under the skin.The red-purple color is actually the blood vessels showing from beneath the skin.They appear mainly on the face , but they can also appear anywhere on the body.As a person gets older , port wine birthmarks usually get darker and thicker . Port wine birthmarks often keep a child from feeling good about his appearance.The sooner they are treated , the sooner the child can feel better about himself . Luckily , doctors have a safe way to remove these birthmarks.They use a pulsed-dye laser.The laser zeros in on the red color in the blood vessels . It then passes harmlessly through the skin to destroy the large blood vessels and the discoloration . Later , normal-sized blood vessels grow in their place . Dear Dr. Cory : // What is epilepsy ?

Most seizures last a few minutes , and then the brain returns to normal . About 2.5 million Americans have epilepsy . More than half the time , no one knows why epilepsy begins .

Why does my hair get so staticky in the winter , but not in the summer ? Trang Vo Weymouth , Massachusetts Dear Trang : Static electricity happens more on cold , dry winter days because dry air does n't pick up electrical charges as easily as moist air . Warm , humid air will easily pick up the negative charges from the hair , keeping it electrically neutral . It 's only when there is a buildup of electrical charges that static electricity-and fly-away hair-occur . Try combing your hair in the bathroom just after you have showered . See if the humidity in the air helps to prevent static electricity . , Your friend , Cory SerVaas , M.D. Footnote Send your health questions to : " Ask Doctor Cory , " Child Life , RO .
