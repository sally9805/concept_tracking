Since the age of steam , the European labor movement has mustered red flags and brass bands on May Day for a traditional show of strength . But this year , post-May Day , Europe faces a labor paradox that Karl Marx never foresaw . While 15 million people are registered as unemployed in the 15-nation European Union , millions of jobs still go begging for lack of qualified applicants . <P> It 's taken a while , but Europe 's leaders have begun to recognize the need for labor reforms along lines familiar in the U.S. They have started to talk about promoting lifelong learning , lowering taxes on labor and increasing the gap between what a person gets on welfare vs. on the job . Indeed , Europe 's overall fiscal health and strong growth prospects present a golden opportunity to launch those moves . But like all other opportunities , it may be fleeting . Says Romano Prodi , head of the European Commission , the regulatory arm of the E.U. : " We must act now , because the challenges facing us can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts agree , is grounded in an inflexible education system , high payroll and social-security taxes and barriers to job-seeking mobility . The resulting high number of jobless  --  roughly half of whom have been out of work for more than a year  --  is just part of the story . " There are twice as many people in Europe who would work , if work were available , than there are people currently recorded as unemployed , " notes the E.U. 's employment commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou . According to the European Commission , only 61% of European adults are employed , vs. 75% in the U.S. <P> The difference is particularly great among European women , only half of whom work ; more than two-thirds do in the U.S. Part of the problem is legal : France and Belgium , for instance , have just lifted 19th century restrictions on women working at night . But there are cultural barriers too , particularly in Southern Europe and rural regions . More women work in countries where there are better public child-care facilities and more equitable wages ; Europe needs more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't just a question of fairness , " says Barbara Helfferich , a top aide to Diamantopoulou . " It 's a question of being competitive in a globalized market . " <P> Even where things are great , they 're not so good . The Netherlands in many respects is Europe 's model economy , with an official unemployment rate of 4%  --  the lowest in the E.U. except for tiny Luxembourg , at 2.8% . Its boom helped the country cut joblessness more than 50% since the early 1990s . " We 're working at capacity , " says Joop Hartog , professor of economics at the University of Amsterdam . " We should be happy with that . " An active labor policy bolsters the boom by offering tax credits for low earners , more child-care and after-school facilities to ease women 's path into employment , and more intensive mentoring  --  or hectoring  --  of unemployed to get them into the work force . But jobless people over the age of 57 1/2 are not counted as unemployed ; neither are 911,000 Dutch people on disability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times the number of officially unemployed  --  is such a stubborn feature of the economy that it 's been called the Dutch disease . Tightening disability definitions and other measures have n't cured it .
