Had you attended a Texas state fair last year , you might have noticed a group of Japanese men dressed in jeans and boots , gazing at the sea of pickup trucks in the parking area . The men were from Toyota , which has been trying with scant success for years to persuade Americans to dump their Ford and Chevy pickups  --  the cowboy Cadillacs of the heartland  --  for a Toyota . Spending hours observing folks as they tailgated , hitched up horse trailers and hauled everything from plywood to goat sheds , the Japanese took copious notes , even if they still could n't quite understand the American lovefest with the pickup .

Toyota is constructing its sixth North American assembly plant , in the heart of truck country just outside San Antonio , Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tundra pickup there and  --  if all goes as planned  --  finally conquer the U.S. truck market . Achieving that feat would mark a milestone for Toyota in its quest to become the great American car company and would follow its conquest of virtually every other market segment , from compact cars to luxury SUVs ( by way of Lexus ) .
