Faced with serious challenges , these women found that it was the simple changes to their diet and exercise that made the biggest difference of all . BY ALICE LESCH KELLY // " YOGA HELPED ME FIGHT DEPRESSION . " Kimberly Chau , 30 , Los Angeles When my mom called , I could n't get home fast enough : My father had liver cancer , and doctors believed he was dying . Overnight I morphed into someone else . Normally energetic and optimistic , I found myself holed up in my bedroom alone , devastated at the thought of losing him . Even when he began chemotherapy and it looked like he might recover , I still could n't shake my sadness . I started seeing a therapist , but crying to him felt so useless , and I was n't ready to try medication . When a co-worker who was an avid yoga fan suggested that taking a class would lift my spirits , I was skeptical . I did n't see how an hour of stretching and breathing could make me feel less depressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a rough time and persuaded me to try it . Walking into that first session , I felt nervous . But as I got into the routine , I was struck by how it cleared my head and reduced my anxiety . After 10 rounds of sun salutations and countless other poses , I felt empowered and accomplished . I started going to classes twice a week . Yoga gave me something to look forward to when nothing else could drag me from my apartment . Soon I started waking up happy and grateful , the way I used to . ( My dad 's health was improving too . After chemotherapy and a liver transplant , he has made a full recovery . ) And over time I became physically and mentally stronger , which helped me feel that no matter what happened I would n't fall apart again . Ultimately yoga led me to make a major career change : Inspired by how physical therapy helped my father , I left my marketing job to start studying occupational therapy . And I became a certified yoga instructor so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a required part of certification , I taught classes at a wellness center for cancer patients and their families . A woman told me that one of the warrior poses made her truly feel like a survivor . I could n't have agreed with her more . " SWIMMING HELPED ME CONQUER MS . " Kate Hooks , 28 , Baltimore I started running when I was 12 , so naturally I was psyched to be recruited for the cross-country team in college . But during the first race of my sophomore year , my legs literally stopped supporting the rest of my body . I fell a few times before friends watching nearby persuaded me to drop out . Despite my initial protests , I knew something was n't right . The team 's trainer sent me to get X-rayed , but the results came back normal . He told me to see a neurologist , who then diagnosed me with multiple sclerosis , a debilitating nerve disease . My parents cried that day , but strangely enough , I did n't . Because my dad had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news in stride . He did n't seem to let his condition get the best of him , so why should I ? I returned to school and kept as busy as possible , hanging out with my old teammates - even trying to train with them in the gym when I could - and focusing on my classes . If I could n't run , I told myself that I 'd just find another way to stay active . The real panic did n't hit me until months later . I was at the local convenience store with my friend and could n't find my favorite mint-chocolate-cookie ice cream . I broke down . My hysterical reaction was the result of months of pent-up frustration , fear and anger as I tried to pretend nothing was changing . But it had : I could no longer run or ride a bike . And even walking around campus was becoming difficult . Dreading a second meltdown , I knew that I needed to do something besides wallow in self-pity . I desperately missed running , but I knew that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started to think more seriously about swimming , which I 'd heard was a good way for people with MS to stay fit . After a few weeks I grew to love the complexity of swimming as a sport - the different strokes , the breathing techniques - and , after a while , you could n't keep me out of the pool . Because MS was affecting my muscles , I would n't have been able to exercise without the cushion of the water . I felt safe and confident in the pool , and before long I began to rely on those regular workouts as a way to clear my head and keep me sane , the way running once did . Since I sometimes need a wheelchair , the pool is the only place now where I feel like I do n't have MS ; no one knows anything 's wrong with me when I 'm doing the crawl stroke . My disease may have destroyed my ability to run , but I 'm still the athlete I always was . And MS can never take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIFE BACK . " Carol Arnold , 35 , Hampton , N.H. The first time the home pregnancy test came back negative , I felt relieved : I was newly married , in my mid-20s , and I was n't ready to be a mom . But three months later , my period still had n't come , and I had started gaining several pounds a month . Within two years I ballooned from about 130 pounds to 290 pounds , but since obesity and diabetes run in my family , I was n't completely shocked . I figured I was just eating more than usual and I 'd lose the weight when I cut back ( something I admit I was n't very diligent about ) . But when I got acne that rivaled my adolescent days and excessive hair growth on my chin , I knew I had to seek answers . At first , doctors told me that just losing weight would fix my other problems , but I knew deep down that it was more complicated than that , so I kept on searching . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndrome ( PCOS ) , a type of hormonal imbalance . My doctor wanted me to take drugs to get my hormone levels in check , but I had read that modifying one 's diet could make as big a difference ; under my doctor 's guidance , I started seeing a dietitian , who told me to drastically cut back on refined carbs and sugars to help me immediately lower my insulin levels ( see " The Experts " Take , " below ) . I began a strict diet that carefully balanced carbs , protein and fat . I traded heaping plates of spaghetti for measured portions mixed with chicken and lots of veggies , and when I ate salad I passed on the croutons . The difference this made in my health was amazing - almost miraculous . Within the first two weeks of my new eating plan , my period returned , and not long after , my acne and facial hair all but vanished . I lost 30 pounds in two months . That initial progress gave me the boost I needed to start hitting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in helping to maintain my weight ( and keep my insulin levels steady ) . Four or five days a week I did an hour of cardio - the bike , treadmill and stair climber were among my favorites . Every other day I added a half hour of strength training . To date I 'm down to 200 pounds , although I have 50 more to go . Sticking to my low-carb diet is key to maintaining my health , but I do n't freak out if I eat an extra-large bagel ; I just follow the plan more carefully the next day . I wo n't let myself fall off the wagon completely because I 'm happy about the way I feel - and look - right now . Sidebar After a few weeks of yoga , Kimberly grew strong and self-reliant .

Symptoms include fatigue and difficulty walking and balancing . HOW EXERCISE HELPS MS does make exercise more challenging , but staying active in some way can improve strength and alleviate fatigue , says John Richert , M.D. , vice president of research and clinical programs at the National MS Society . Swimming is particularly recommended because water supports the body , allowing patients to strengthen and maintain muscle tone in a low-impact environment . " Cool water between 80F and 84F can be therapeutic , " explains Richert , because heat can further impair nerve functioning .

Sidebar the experts ' take PCOS , which affects an estimated 6 to 1O percent of all women , is a hormonal imbalance in which the ovaries produce excess male hormones , often as a result of high insulin levels . Common symptoms include irregular periods , excessive facial and body hair , acne and high blood pressure . Without treatment , PCOS can lead to diabetes and infertility . HOW DIET AND EXERCISE HELP " For nearly 70 percent of patients with PCOS , changing their diet and starting a consistent workout routine can significantly reduce symptoms , " says Ricardo A. Azziz , M.D. , director of the Center for Androgen-Related Disorders at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles . Maintaining a healthy weight - through exercise and a diet low in sugars and carbs ( baked goods , sweets , potatoes , pasta ) - can decrease glucose levels and help the body use insulin more efficiently , thereby helping to restore a normal period and reduce other symptoms .
