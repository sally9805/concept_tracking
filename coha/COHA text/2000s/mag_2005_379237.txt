Rove on the Spot <P> Our story on the legal and political storm over the disclosure of a CIA officer 's identity and Karl Rove 's involvement drew mail from readers who expressed their dismay at the lengths to which the White House will go to discredit critics . Others dismissed the affair as a partisan attack on President Bush 's key strategist <P> Whether Karl Rove technically broke a law when he leaked the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame wife of Administration critic Joseph Wilson is beside the point July 25 . Despite repeated denials by the White House , Rove talked about Plame to TIME 's Matthew Cooper as well as to Robert Novak , the reporter who blew her cover . So the President 's deputy chief of staff was involved in revealing the identity of a covert CIA officer because her husband disputed George W. Bush 's claim that Iraq attempted to buy uranium from Niger . The President 's right-hand man is at best a rat and at worst a traitor . <P> HAL MARCH - Williamstown , Mass . <P> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's successful presidential campaigns and of Republican congressional victories . The Democrats will do or say anything to destroy the conservative political genius . This " controversy " has nothing to do with national security ; it is party politics as usual . <P> HUGH MAGUIRE - Natick , Mass . <P> We do n't know yet if Rove committed a criminal act . But we do know the answers to other questions : Is he a character assassin ? Absolutely . Is he unethical ? Without a doubt . Those answers should be enough to ride him out of town on a rail . The Bush Administration , however , will probably give him a raise . <P> JANE VOIGT - Arlington , Va . <P> Why even pose the question of whether Rove will pay the price for his role in the Plame debacle ? Rove is a political strategist who knows precisely what to say  --  or not to say  --  to keep himself out of hot water . He knew just what he was doing with his campaign of innuendo . Unfortunately , somebody else is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rove should be fired immediately , but it will be hard for the President to oust his most trusted adviser . <P> JENNIFER DENNY - Peoria , Ill . <P> Lost in the cacophony of media attention surrounding Rove 's possible misdeeds is one basic fact : in the buildup to the U.S. invasion of Iraq , this Administration misled the American people regarding Iraq 's development of nuclear weapons . That important fact is now virtually forgotten . Meanspirited Novak , a shill for the political right , publicly outed Wilson 's wife Plame . That was the Administration 's first parry to deflect public attention . And with the continuing diversion of the American people 's attention from the central issue of deception , the Administration is having things just the way it wants . <P> GREGORY J. RYAN - Woodland Hills , Calif . <P> It is absurd that New York Times reporter Judith Miller was put in jail for refusing to reveal her confidential sources and Rove remains in a job paid for by U.S. taxpayers . It 's time for Bush to demonstrate true character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relative legality of Rove 's actions , which were at the very least arrogant and unethical . That sort of behavior should not be tolerated by either the President or the American people . We expect better from our public servants , elected or otherwise .
