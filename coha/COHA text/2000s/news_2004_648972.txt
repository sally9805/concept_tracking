<p> In the linebackers ' meeting room inside the Baltimore Ravens ' practice facility this week , Mike Singletary tried to explain how grown men try to scare other grown men . <p> For 12 years in the middle of the Chicago Bears defense , Singletary the linebacker defined intimidation . Now , he is in his second season as the linebackers coach of perhaps the most talented player in the league , Ray Lewis , on a defense whose reputation for punishment and playmaking is well earned . <p> " You still have some players who are selling wolf tickets , " Singletary said of the league 's lesser lights in an interview Thursday . " They will get out on the field , the game starts and they find out that there are players even better than they thought . Then it 's , ' Man , this guy is faster than I thought he was , stronger than I thought he was and bigger than I thought he was . ' When that happens , you start to forget your skills and your technique , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when you 're in a survival mode , that 's when the intimidation comes . You are just hanging on . " <p> Since 1996 , the team 's first season in Baltimore , the Ravens have projected an image of 11 black helmets swarming to the football , imposing their will with unequaled fervor . Coupled with that tenacity has been a penchant for off-the-field trouble that has rendered the Ravens a latter-day version of the 1970 's Oakland Raiders , a team of supreme talent mixed in with an occasional episode of lawlessness . <p> No team in recent years has been as big a lightning rod for controversy ; the two best players  --  Ray Lewis and running back Jamal Lewis  --  have been involved in high-profile scrapes with the law . <p> In January 2000 , Ray Lewis was charged with two counts of murder after a shooting outside an Atlanta nightclub after Super Bowl XXXIV . The charges were eventually dropped , and he pleaded to a lesser count of obstruction of justice . <p> Jamal Lewis , who faced a federal indictment on drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to a lesser charge last month and will serve four months in prison and two months in a halfway house after the season . <p> Even some of the lower-profile players have been in trouble with the law . Cornerback Corey Fuller was arrested in April on a felony firearms possession charge and on felony and misdemeanor charges that he used his home in Tallahassee , Fla. , as a high-stakes gambling house . <p> In December , linebacker Terrell Suggs was charged with two counts of felony assault stemming from a March 2003 fight outside Phoenix Municipal Stadium after a three-on-three basketball tournament . <p> Still , the organization plays down the view of the Ravens as bandits , even as that view shrouds them with a certain mystique . <p> " We do n't have bad characters , " Ozzie Newsome , the team 's vice president and general manager , said Thursday . " We 've had some guys who made some mistakes . We 're no different than any other team in this league and we 're no different than society . We 've got some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad characters . " <p> Singletary agreed . " The Raiders were a team that you were already in trouble , " he said . " Al Davis took all of them . They were like the land of the misfits , ' Hey , I can spread my wings , I can be crazy here , I do n't have to conform here . ' <p> " Ray happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time . Guilt by association . But he had n't had any problems up to then . But because of that problem , his signature has been that whenever you think of Ray , it 's , ' Oh yeah , that 's the guy that almost went to jail . " ' <p> The Raiders encouraged a rebellious image . Tom Flores , the coach from 1979-87 , said Davis , the team 's owner , " always considered himself not a street person but someone who grew up tough in Brooklyn . <p> " He embraced that kind of attitude and wanted the team to do it , " Flores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " Along with great players come unique players , and you have to be able to handle those people , and it seems like Brian Billick is doing well , " he said of the Ravens ' coach . <p> The times of strife have often been bonding experiences for the Ravens , even learning experiences , some of them said . <p> " You have to be one way on the field  --  it 's a gladiator sport , " linebacker Ed Hartwell said . " But off the field , you have to be a man and live in society , know where you are , know what you are doing and abide by those rules . You have to know how to flip on and off that switch . " <p> To watch the Ravens is to see physical marvels . Newsome has often said he can still see Ray Lewis chasing down Giants running back Tiki Barber in Super Bowl XXXV , one of many images of Lewis that stick in teammates ' and opponents ' minds . <p> Several Ravens discount the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents watch them fly to the ball on film and then feel the Ravens ' hits . Lewis and safety Ed Reed , who has almost single-handedly won three games this season by causing turnovers , are prime examples of players who have turned voracious study habits into physical prowess . <p> Ray Lewis , asked if he felt opponents feared him , said : " I do n't know if I want to use the word fear . I 'd say they are very aware . " <p> Others go further . <p> " I know from being on this team and playing against them that No. 52 commands a lot of respect , " Fuller said . " I have heard guys say : ' Ray ? We ai n't scared of Ray . ' When a guy says he ai n't scared of you , he 's scared . " <p> Opponents , including Jets running back Curtis Martin , dismiss such bravado . When asked during a conference call Wednesday if the Ravens were intimidators , Martin said : " This is the N.F.L. If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Washington Redskins running back Clinton Portis and Philadelphia Eagles receiver Terrell Owens have also challenged notions of Baltimore 's fear factor this season , calling out Ray Lewis by name and , in Owens 's case , mocking his pregame dance . <p> But the Ravens stand by their tough image , which has come to define them every bit as much as their talent . <p> " I think a lot of teams , when they do scouting reports on us , they can see that on offense and on defense , these guys are like bullies , " Jamal Lewis said of the Ravens . <p> Billick said the Ravens ' desire to intimidate and impose their will on opponents was " not meant to be disrespectful . " <p> " This team is n't disrespectful , but it 's very confident , " he said . " It tries to do that and then teams counter that with their particular will , and that 's what makes it an exciting battle .
