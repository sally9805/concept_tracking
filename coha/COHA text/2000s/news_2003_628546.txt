<p> In a never-ending struggle to control their own destinies , cities in the Houston area and around the state managed to hold or gain ground on two hot topics - annexation and manufactured-housing regulations - as the Texas legislative session ended last week . <p> Along the way , local government officials helped devise ways to keep sensitive information on water supplies out of terrorists ' hands without trashing public records laws and fretted that brazen polluters will be coddled instead of clobbered when they 're caught red-handed . And coastal communities won some money to control beach erosion . <p> " Just now , we feel good for what did n't happen , " James Thurmond , city manager of Missouri City in Fort Bend County , said of the session . <p> Thurmond referred to bills that would have limited the ability of growing cities such as Missouri City to annex adjacent property . <p> One bill that failed to get to Gov . Rick Perry 's desk would have required a vote of residents in areas proposed for annexation before the areas could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Houston 's expected efforts to annex The Woodlands , a fate residents of the master-planned community vehemently oppose . <p> " It died primarily because it 's a bad idea , " said Frank Sturzl , executive director of the Texas Municipal League , which represents 1,065 of the state 's approximately 1,200 municipalities . <p> With help from city officials around the state , the municipal league convinced legislators that some cities need to be able to annex suburban areas and increase municipal tax revenues to preserve existing infrastructure , draw new businesses and encourage organized regional development . <p> The league based its arguments on a study it commissioned that concluded restrictions on annexation would cost the state 's economy nearly $ 100 billion in lost retail sales and $ 168 billion in lost personal income in the next 30 years or so . <p> And despite the opposition of the manufactured-housing industry , cities gained the right to require that modular homes blend into neighborhoods in which they are located . <p> " Essentially , cities can now require that if modular homes are brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be equal to the median value of existing homes in the neighborhood , " Sturzl said . <p> The homes also would have to conform to city codes such as setbacks and facades . <p> Few bills before the 78th Legislature were written to address specific problems in specific cities . However , some bills pertain to certain larger areas . <p> For example , the city of Galveston , Galveston County and other coastal counties won approval of only $ 7.5 million in grant money that can be used for erosion control and other shoreline-related projects in the next two years . Area legislators had sought $ 15 million in grant money . <p> Still , the Texas General Land Office won an extension of a deadline for spending more than $ 2 million in grant money appropriated during the 2001 legislative session . The extension will allow completion of beach-replenishment projects along large sections of west Galveston Island later this year . <p> Thurmond said the state budget crisis will have a trickle-down effect on city and county governments that will cause reductions in grants such as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parks and Wildlife Department for construction of a local park . <p> Montgomery County Judge Alan B. Sadler said his jurisdiction lost one battle and won another during the session . <p> The county failed to induce legislators to keep advertising companies from simply moving billboards to make way for eventual widening of stretches of Texas 105 and FM 1488 . A bill to eliminate the billboards altogether never got out of legislative committee . <p> The Legislature did lower from 25,000 to 9,000 the number of signatures of registered voters needed on petitions for an election to decide whether the Montgomery County Hospital District should be dissolved . The district has long been in turmoil over alleged mismanagement , among other problems . <p> If voters eventually dissolve the district , the county commission will have to pick up the tab for indigent health care . <p> " We 'll do it if the voters want us to , " Sadler said . <p> Lawmakers also approved legislation that would give the Texas Natural Resources Commission ( SEE CORRECTION ) sole right to decide whether criminal or civil cases should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental laws . <p> Jeri Yenne , Brazoria County district attorney , said she will ask Perry to veto the bill because it " creates separate standards of prosecution for those companies with permits and those without . " <p> If Perry signs the bill , large numbers of polluters could avoid criminal charges , Yenne said . <p> " If you want to violate the law , you just go out and get a permit , " she said . <p> Government secrecy was another concern during the legislative session . <p> Municipal and local law enforcement and federal homeland security officials had a meeting of the minds with news organizations and consumer groups that resulted in a law allowing government to keep secret certain information that could be used by terrorists , Sturzl said . <p> " For example , the federal government requires assessments of some water systems of certain sizes to show where they are vulnerable to terrorist attacks , " Sturzl said . " That information is confidential under federal law , but it was n't so clear that it was confidential under state law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document that shows where you 're vulnerable , obviously you do n't want that out , " he said . <p> At least one bill the Legislature adopted and that is on Perry 's desk for possible enactment caught local officials off-guard . <p> Senate Bill 501 has caused consternation in city halls across the state . It would prohibit cities and other governmental agencies from adopting ordinances to prevent people who possess licenses to carry concealed handguns from packing their pistols on government property , including public parks . <p> " Can you believe that ? " Galveston City Attorney Susie Green said . " I find that cause for concern , to say the least . I 'm concerned for the safety of city employees and visitors to city buildings . " <p> Green said she will meet with City Manager Steve LeBlanc and Police Chief Bob Pierce to discuss the issue . <p> Missouri City 's Thurman said he also opposes people carrying pistols in City Hall or on other government property . <p> " I just do n't understand that , " Thurman said of Senate Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Texas Municipal League to monitor legislators and count on league lobbyists to fight any bills that might reduce cities ' powers to govern themselves . <p> Each year , member cities help the league pick a laundry list of bills they want passed or killed . <p> When needed , local officials travel to Austin to bolster league efforts.Although government at every level in the state will feel the effects of large cuts legislators made because of a budget crisis , Sturzl said local governments did n't lose much autonomy this time around . <p> " We dodged most of the bullets , " Sturzl said . <p> <p> LOCAL LEGISLATION OUT OF AUSTIN <p> Highlights of the 78th legislative session affecting localities : <p> BILLS THAT PASSED <p> Mobile homes : Allows cities to require that modular homes blend into neighborhoods and conform to city codes . <p> Shorelines : Allocates only $ 7.5 million in grants for shoreline projects in the next two years . <p> Montgomery County Hospital District : Lowers to 9,000 the number of signatures needed for an election to dissolve the district . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORRECTION ) sole right to decide whether to file cases against companies that hold state permits and violate environmental laws . <p> Gun control : Prohibits ordinances to prevent people who are licensed to carry concealed handguns from packing their pistols on government property . <p> Anti-terrorism : Allows governments to keep secret information that could be used by terrorists . <p> BILLS THAT DIED <p> Annexation : Sought to require a vote of residents to OK their annexation by a city . <p> Billboards : Tried to eliminate billboards along Texas 105 and FM 1488 in Montgomery County . <p> To learn what happened to legislation related to local government during the 78th Texas legislative session , readers can check out the Texas Municipal League 's Internet site for the information to be posted this week .
