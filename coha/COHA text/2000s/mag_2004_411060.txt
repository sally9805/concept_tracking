Follow these simple steps and your CCD images will have the quality of photographs . // Today 's amateur astronomers live by a new rule : Film is dead , and the digital age of CCD cameras is upon us . This transformation did n't happen overnight . To be honest , the first digital images taken by amateur astronomers were n't very good . Today , however , expectations are higher . We expect a digital image to look like a photograph . For more than a decade , I 've been exploring some of the concepts necessary to help amateur astronomers do this . My primary equipment is a Santa Barbara Instruments Group ST-10E CCD camera fastened to a 14.5-inch f/8 Astrographic Cassegrain telescope . But whatever equipment you use , do n't expect the CCD to produce a good image by itself . Half the work occurs after you obtain the image . Post-processing - the " art " component of CCD imaging - is the key to transforming electronic data into photograph-like astronomical portraits . Photograph TONY HALLAS in his private observatory , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The cleanup begins One of the major problems encountered with film during the 150-year history of its use by astronomers is " grain " the exposed silver halide crystals that make up the developed image . The spacing of these crystals limits the resolution of the negative , the size to which the image can be reproduced , and the details that can be seen . CCD cameras also have resolution limitations , but a more severe problem is " noise . " A CCD camera works by focusing light onto an electronic chip , which is basically an array of sensors called " pixels . " Because of inherent defects in the chip due to the manufacturing process , some of these pixels will produce false data that look like incoming light . In the jargon of CCD astronomy , they become " hot . " Hot pixels show up as white spots all over an image , and our first step is to get rid of them . Because hot pixels have nothing to do with the image , we can cover the camera and make an exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dark frame . " The next step is to use software ( generally provided by the camera 's manufacturer ) to convert all hot pixels to cold pixels of equal strength and subtract each from its corresponding hot pixel . ( Because a CCD records digital data , this really is just a subtraction of one number from another . ) The hot and cold information cancels out , leaving behind the real image . This step is called " dark subtract . " Photograph HOT PIXELS IN A CCD IMAGE ( left ) of the Whirlpool Galaxy show up as white spots . Eliminate hot pixels ( right ) by subtracting a dark-frame exposure . // Say " nay " to stray rays With our cleaner image , we now notice another significant source of noise . Sprinkled randomly across the image are small streaks and dots - the punctuation of outer space . CCD cameras are so sensitive they record cosmic rays striking the chip ! Cosmic rays are energetic particles that originate from a variety of objects in space , including the Sun . We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they 're random in pattern . But this randomness gives us a way to eliminate them . Photograph THE ORION NEBULA ( m42 ) AND THE RUNNING MAN NEBULA ( NGC 1977 ) were imaged through the author 's 7-inch f/7 Astro-Physics refractor . Photograph THE PINWHEEL GALAXY ( M33 ) in Triangulum was imaged with the author 's 14.5-inch f/8 Astrographic Cassegrain reflector . This image actually was made on hypersensitized Kodak RG 200 print film , then the original negative was scanned and all post-processing was done digitally . Photograph COSMIC-RAY HITS are revealed as bright spots randomly strewn throughout images of the galaxy ; software compares images and removes the spots . // Let 's take , for example , five similar pictures of a test object , the Whirlpool Galaxy ( M51 ) in Canes Venatici . After performing a dark subtract to each frame to get rid of the hot pixels , there will be cosmic-ray hits sprinkled here and there . We can use software to identify the elements that are common to the five images so the computer has no problem identifying what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like people dressed in blue jeans at a formal dinner , and once identified , they can be eliminated . This is called " median combining . " Data lost Most quality CCD cameras now capture information in 14- or 16-bit mode , as opposed to the 8-bit mode of early models . This means more detail is captured in the image . " High bit depth " allows for better processing of the image after it is recorded because there 's more information to work with . Linked to this is " dynamic range , " which is ( in numerical terms ) how extreme - from light to dark - the CCD can record . When you combine high bit depth with good dynamic range you have the foundation for a great image . Were it only this simple . It 's usually at this point that trouble begins . Knowing how to process the data from this point onward is paramount to achieving photo-realistic images . The number one mistake that leads to bad processing is throwing away some of the data . Some " automatic " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " normal " images rather than astronomical ones . Likewise , data can be lost through human error . The image above shows the Whirlpool Galaxy after bad processing . In this case , the nucleus of the galaxy is burned up and the delicate detail of its arms and the faint background galaxies are all gone . Where did the detail go ? Photograph THE DUMBBELL NEBULA ( M27 ) in Vulpecula is an LRGB image of 100,100 , 80 , and 160 minutes , respectively . THE CRAB NEBULA ( M1 ) is a composite of nine 12-minute CCD exposures . A CLIPPED IMAGE OF M51 shows no detail in the bright areas , and faint objects have faded to black and disappeared into the background . COMET HALE-BOPP drifts past the North American Nebula ( NGC 7000 ) in Cygnus . For this view , the author used a 165mm lens on a Pentax 6x7 camera with Kodak PPF 400 film and digital processing . // What happened to our example is called " clipping , " an apt name because we clipped off the data on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faint things became pure black ; bright things with still some detail became pure white . In essence , the dynamic range was reduced . Photoshop to the rescue Adobe Photoshop is a terrific image-processing program that 1 recommend highly . Let 's open the example image of M51 with Photoshop , this time being careful not to lose the detail at the ends of the dynamic range . To do that , bring the image into Photoshop in full 16-bit mode . At first , the image looks dark . I use the curves function to anchor down the end points of the dynamic range and start " stretching " the data in the middle . Think of this as a rubber band . You can pull it this way and that , but the ends remain the same . Our goal is to lighten the tonal values in the middle . After a few iterations of adjusting the curves , a better image begins to appear . Notice that the ends of our data have not been clipped . Without getting too technical , we can adjust the curves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not washed out . So far so good . Our shadow detail shows much more information . Now , can we bring out more detail in the bright nucleus ? Photograph THE HORSEHEAO NEBULA ( BARNARD 33 ) in Orion was imaged with an SBIG ST-10E CCD camera attached to a 6-inch Astro-Physics refractor at f/7. rTONY HALLAS AND BILL WILLIAMS PHOTOSHOP ' ' 5 " CURVES " FUNCTION left ) allows you to adjust either the overall image or any of the color channels . Overexposed areas of the image , also known as burned-out regions , look better when darkened , but that creates an unattractive circle of unequal illumination ( center ) . This circle is eliminated by the process of feathering ( right ) . SPIRAL GALAXY NGC 7331 was captured during a 150-minute exposure made by the author from Foresthill , California . THE VEIL NEBULA was a 12-minute exposure through a 4-inch William Yang refractor at f/8. // Let 's select the area we want to darken . Using curves again , we 'll bring the tonal values down inside the circle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious . Let 's feather the selection so the darkening effect is gradual . Now the boundary is invisible , and the nucleus is darker . These adjustments reveal details from the dim depths of space all the way to the bright nucleus of the galaxy . 16-bit data and high dynamic range that were not clipped made this possible . Ultimately - with enough data - one can bring up the shadow detail while holding the galaxy at a normal density so that myriad background galaxies appear . In one image of the Whirlpool Galaxy ( not shown ) , I used this technique to remove the brightest stars . Most of the barely visible " fuzzies " left in the image were galaxies , the dimmest registering at a faint 24th magnitude ! Dealing with color Finally , there is color , and the same concepts apply - threefold . CCD cameras only record in black and white , but if we define red , green , and blue channels with filters , we can create images in each of those colors . Recombining the three color images gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is commonly called the " tri-color technique . " In practice , it 's the same as using black-and-white film with the added benefit of a CCD camera 's sensitivity . Photograph A GREAT EXAMPLE of using digital processing to bring out the best of a film image is this picture of the summer Milky Way . The original exposure was through a 35mm Nikon lens using Kodak RG 200 film . The negative was scanned and the picture was brought to life with the help of Adobe Photoshop . THE TRI-COLOR TECHNIQUE involves taking three separate images through a CCD camera , one each through red , green , and blue filters . Combining the images with software gives a full color ( RGB ) image . COLOR PLUS LUMINANCE data equals a stunning LRGB image . // We can improve our image with one more step . Would n't it be great if we could sharpen a single black-and-white image , making it the " detail " part , and combine it with the RGB color information to create a " super image " with the best qualities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminance , " or " L , " can be taken and combined with the color data to produce a fantastic " LRGB " image . I have touched upon some important concepts to help you achieve photo-realistic images using a digital source . Other CCD processing techniques exist , and some offer greater technical depth . The sky truly is the limit when it comes to CCD imaging . A solid foundation rooted in the basic concept of preserving all data in the final image is a prerequisite for achieving the best results . Indeed , new CCD technology allows you to venture far beyond the boundaries imposed by film .
