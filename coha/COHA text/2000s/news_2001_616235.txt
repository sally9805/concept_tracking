<p> It 's 2010 . You 're daydreaming at your desk , wondering whether you have all the ingredients at home to make your favorite spaghetti sauce . You check the Internet to find out . Whoops . You 're out of ground beef . No problem . Your refrigerator simply goes online to order more from the grocery store so that it 's waiting for you in a shopping cart when you arrive after work . <p> Thanks to cutting-edge technologies , the art of shopping is going to change  --  a lot . <p> Already chains such as Best Buy are making bar-code scanners and other wireless devices available to customers so they can check prices  --  and ultimately check out  --  without the help of clerks . <p> Soon scanners will be able to recognize the likes of apples and broccoli so that now-unidentifiable produce is no longer an obstacle to shoppers eager to make a hasty exit from the store . <p> Self-checkout technology already has swept Europe but has just started to catch on in the United States over the past year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually every new Kroger , including several in the Atlanta area . Indeed the nation 's largest grocery chain plans to put self-service lanes in 500 more stores across the country over the next 12 months . <p> Other stores including Wal-Mart also have begun putting bar-code scanners in customers ' hands so that they can check out without clerks . <p> The system allows customers to scan their own groceries and pay a cash machine that can provide change or accept a debit or credit card . <p> " It 's been a tight market so labor 's been a big issue for stores , so this is a way they can save on labor costs , " said Glen Feeley , a salesman with PSC Inc. , a major manufacturer of self-checkout systems . <p> Perhaps most importantly , within the next several years , so-called smart tags will adorn almost every product , providing manufacturers and customers with a wide range of electronic information , everything from the product 's exact location to instructions on how to recycle its packaging . <p> " This is the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who heads the Auto-ID Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . <p> The ubiquitous bar code , a 1970s technology , already identifies various objects . But bar codes need to be visible and must be deliberately scanned one at a time . <p> The Auto-ID Center , opened in 1999 , hopes to replace bar codes with smart tags that do n't have to be scanned because they contain microchips and wireless antennas . When the microchips are powered , the antennas transmit data from them to a computer . <p> Here 's how it works : A microchip transmits a signal when exposed to the energy field of a nearby reader , anything from a gate to a wall . An energized microchip announces a product 's identity by relaying its unique product code via very low-power radio . <p> It 's similar to the way today 's highway tollbooths often rely on readers to pick up signals from tags in cars as they drive by . <p> What all this means is that you will be able to fill a shopping cart with tagged products and push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices of the items , and a swipe of your debit card will take that amount from your account . <p> You 'll be done with your shopping in no time flat . <p> But these microchips  --  no bigger than a grain of sand  --  are destined to make other huge splashes in the retail world as well . <p> With the help of smart tags , which will be tested as early as this fall , companies will be able to keep constant track of their products , all the way from the warehouse to a customer 's kitchen , so that they 'll be able to determine exactly what and when customers are buying . <p> Each time a customer lifts a product off the shelf , the product 's smart tag will zap a message to the manufacturer 's database . <p> This will allow companies to manufacture products in direct proportion to actual customer demand rather than mere forecasts . Therefore , they 'll have better control over inventory , which could result in billions of dollars in savings that could trickle down to the customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer than going to the store and finding that a favorite product 's not in stock , " said Richard Cantwell , vice president of global business management at Gillette Co. , a founding corporate sponsor of the Auto-ID Center . " A huge benefit to the technology is that we 'll be able to make sure Gillette products are always in stock on store shelves . " <p> He foresees a time when customers will be able to use their cell phones to find out the exact ratio of coffee to water after purchasing a new Braun coffee maker , which Gillette markets . <p> Ashton agrees that the technology 's benefits go way beyond the tracking of inventory . He said the technology 's main objective is to give inanimate items the ability to communicate with one another . <p> He envisions a world in which the microwave knows how long to cook certain foods so that you do n't push any buttons . <p> Medicine cabinets will sound a warning whenever you remove two drugs that could prove dangerous if taken together . <p> A carton of milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Already Procter &; Gamble , another sponsor of the Auto-ID Center , has demonstrated a washing machine that knows it 's not supposed to accept a silk blouse , and even rejects a red sock mixed with a bundle of white clothing . <p> " In a few years we will rely on computers that can actually understand what 's going on around us and are able to do things for us in a way that really does make our lives easier , " Ashton said . <p> Although the Auto-ID Center will start conducting trials in the area of inventory tracking this fall , Ashton said it might be 10 years before every product includes its own smart tag . <p> The new tags will carry an electronic code able to identify more than 268 million manufacturers , each with more than 1 million products , such as Charmin toilet paper . <p> But one major challenge remains to be met : Simply put , the tags are too expensive . Tags wo n't be competitive with today 's bar codes unless they cost a penny apiece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of a tag down to about 5 cents , but we need to drive it down to about a penny , and that might not happen for another five years or so , " Ashton said . <p> Therefore , do n't expect smart tags to replace bar codes any time soon . Still , some new , related technologies already are  --  or soon will be  --  making the lives of consumers easier . <p> Jonathan H. Connell , a member of the Exploratory Computer Vision Group at IBM 's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Hawthorne , N.Y. , has written the software for a scanning system nicknamed Veggie Vision that can recognize all different kinds of produce and automatically enter their prices into a store 's checkout system . <p> The system , which has a 95 percent success rate , uses a camera with custom-built software that captures an image of the produce and analyzes its features so that it can be identified . <p> Currently , scanners are n't always able to recognize the likes of bananas and Boston lettuce , so shoppers buying produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Connell said the system could be deployed in some stores within a year . <p> " Customers recognize produce as a big problem and as a big cause of long waits in the checkout line , so I think there 's going to be a lot of interest in this , " he said , adding that the typical store carries about 100 items of loose produce . <p> At the same time , many retailers already have outfitted stores with high-tech gadgets to help customers check prices and check out without the help of clerks . <p> Several chains , including Best Buy and Office Depot , have installed bar-code scanners and other wireless devices in an effort to offset a shortage of employees willing to work for minimum wage . <p> " Self-service is extremely popular in Europe and is catching on fast here in the United States , " said Steve Halliday , vice president of technology at AIM , a trade association for manufacturers and for users of tagging technology . " This is something you 're going to see more and more of in stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is changing so quickly and becoming so reliable it 's hard to predict what might come next . <p> " Certainly we do n't have a crystal ball , but all sorts of exciting new technologies will start to become a reality this year , " Ashton said . " The question is no longer if but when .
