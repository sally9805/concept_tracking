to say , Thank God ! ! I have never regretted my decision to have an abortion and I think those of us that have had them should not be afraid or ashamed to admit it . - Gloria Martinez Trattles Washington , D.C. Thank you and your magazine for all you are continuing to do to maintain awareness for the necessity of safe and legal abortions in this country . Thank you for providing a glimmer of hope that maybe , perhaps , not every woman in this country is willing to sacrifice all that our parents fought for in terms of equal rights because of some political conservative pendulum swing . I look forward to continuing to participate in these kinds of supportive acts . - Dawn Sardella-Ayres Via email I am writing to commend Ms. magazine for once again campaigning for reproductive rights . Over 30 years after Roe v. Wade , many women still feel shame and guilt about abortion ; the need for women to step forward and speak honestly is as real now as it was then . Please let us know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Reproductive Freedom Project , ACLU I just answered a call from Ms. to confirm that yes , I do want my name printed in the " We Had Abortions " area of the Fall issue . I have such mixed feelings about the entire thing . Sadness that it still needs to be said , and that a woman 's right to autonomy over her body is still threatened . Fear of what could happen to me for making such a public admission . Relief that there is something I can do to stand up for my beliefs . And , finally , pride mixed with amusement that I was asked to do this in my ninth month of pregnancy . With the deluge of stories about more and more clinics being closed and laws against driving a minor woman over state lines for an abortion , I had been feeling such a rage of hopelessness over the entire issue . I marched on Washington at the March for Women 's Lives , I 've donated money to the cause and I 've escorted women through protest lines , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I resent the need to make public a deeply private decision , I am happy to be able to contribute to what I hope to be the innumerable voices who declare that we have chosen to exercise control over our own bodies . - Shawna Lisk-Sprester Redwood City , CA SUMMER UNCOVERED I have been a loyal reader for years-in fact , since the tender age of 13 ( I asked for a gift subscription for my birthday ) . I have never until now , 20 years later , felt impassioned enough to actually write a letter to the editor . However , I am so shocked and appalled by the cover photo on the most recent issue Summer 2006 . How could a feminist magazine as profound , revolutionary , inspiring and compelling as Mr. miss how violent and inappropriate the cover picture is ? A woman of color ( Asian , perhaps ? ) stands completely still , expressionless , unflinching as a gas pump is held to her head , a man 's finger on the trigger as if it were a gun . Yes , I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostage " by Big Oil politics . ( Actually , I agree ! ) But how could you print an image this violent ? I am terribly disturbed and I am considering canceling my subscription over this . It 's been a long and lovely relationship , but every good feminist knows that once the relationship turns violent , it 's finally time to leave . - Kristin Rushforth Salt Lake City , UT Editors ' note : We appreciate your passionate response , Kristin , but please do n't mistake the messenger for the message . We see the woman on the cover as a symbol of defiance , even in the face of the real-life violence ( and exploitation ) directed toward her . We want readers to be angry-but at U.S. war policy and Big Oil , not Ms. ! WE 'RE NOT EXAGGERATING For the first time in my life , I purchased Mf. magazine , Winter 2006 issue . Until recently I was a reader of women 's fashion magazines such as InStyle and Cosmopolitan . To me , a feminist magazine was too liberal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as extreme as I thought it would be . It keeps a very neutral standpoint for many of the articles and provides rational views of current issues . " No Comment " ... made me wonder what types of images and messages our society sends us today . I thought it was brilliant how you put the section on the last page . It really made me think after I read your magazine . I will keep purchasing your magazine , and I hope all generations , men and women , would read it . - Kazuko Kawata San Diego , CA TIRED OF MISOGYNY Thank you for printing Nancy Klimas ' article on the facts behind CFS " Wake-Up Call , " Summer 2006 . There has been a decidedly misogynistic view of this disease chronic fatigue syndrome from the very beginning . I was told in 1987 that my whole problem was that I wanted to be a housewife and therefore " resented my husband making me work . " Obviously , the doctor did n't know me very well . When I was a child , I played Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing I never wanted to be was a housewife . In 2000 , a much younger ( but no more open-minded ) doctor was so convinced that I was simply too lazy to work that he ... taunted me , " If you 're able to get to my office , you 're able to get to a job . " He was oblivious to the fact that I had been fired for diligently getting to a job that I could n't perform once I got there . Before I got sick , I would often walk as much as 20 miles a day on a weekend ; after getting sick , there were days that walking the 10 feet from the bed to the bathroom required a half-hour nap on the bathroom floor before I could crawl back to bed . Yet , doctors repeatedly attributed my not following instructions to " exercise my way back to health " to some sexist notion that women do n't like to get sweaty . In the past , a disease with these symptoms was called myalgic encephalomyelitis , but in 1988 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chronic fatigue syndrome .... In fact , there are many other symptoms that are far more worrisome than the fatigue , including neurocognitive dysfunction . None of this is apparent from the intentionally derogatory name chosen by CDC. - Karen M. Campbell , founder , www.CFSfacts.org Sacramento , CA YOU DO N'T OWN US Kudos to Ms. Helen Reddy for a great song in a great time " The Woman Who Roared , " Summer 2006 , but before " I Am Woman " we pre-boomers remember Lesley Gore and her great song " You Do n't Own Me . " I loved that song long before I even knew the word feminist-and I was morphing into one as I sang ! - BonnieL . Apodaca San Luis Obispo , CA FEMINIST ARTIST REMEMBERED I wanted to let you know of the passing of my mother , Erena Rae , a feminist and award-winning artist in New Jersey who used her art to advance an array of causes , including feminism , anti-poverty and antideath penalty . We just completed a website dedicated to my mom and her art , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be deeply pleased if Ms. were to note her passing . - Bruce G. Friedrich Norfolk , VA Editors ' note : Thank you for introducing us to your late mother and her work , Bruce . We 've reproduced one of Erena 's fabulous feminist posters ( left ) . STAINED-GLASS CEILING I was glad to see your reporting on the election of Katharine Jefferts Schori to be the Presiding Bishop of our U.S. Episcopal Church " Milestones , " Summer 2006 . It is a historic stained-glass-ceiling breaker and many of us wept . I write to make a small correction : You say she is the first woman to lead any of the Anglican Communion 's 38 " national denominations . " We do not have denominations ; we have a 79million-member communion , which consists of provinces , of which the U.S. is one . It 's a minor mistake but worth noting , because the word " denomination " calls up images of separateness and different traditions . The Anglican Church is a loose federation of great diversity , held together by common prayer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have managed to hold together since the original split from Rome in the 1500s . Any religion that goes across cultures is vulnerable to conflict over differences ... I hope we can continue to do the hard work of relationships and stay together . - ( The Rev. ) Lyn G. Brakeman Gloucester , MA OOPS ! Oh my ! I thought I had lost a decade of my life when I read the blurb about Marilyn French 's new book , In the Name of Friendship . It gave the date of her novel The Women 's Room as 1988 . I had to shake my aging head to clear the cobwebs because I was sure I 'd read that book much earlier than 1988 . I finally looked it up on my local library site and found that it had been reissued in 1988 and that the original publication date was 1977 . Whew-I was relieved to know that I was right and that the " eyeopening " novel was truly part of my history as a feminist . - Mary Jo Kraus Via email " They Took the Nobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teresa did not die in 1947 it was 1997. - Jennifer Reid Oakland , CA WISDOM FROM AN ELDER My Summer ' 06 Ms. just came and as usual I am neglecting everything but food and sleep while I read it . The letters pages are , as with most publications ... interesting , even exciting . One letter which piqued my interest was that from Karen DeCrow , which was , I suppose , useful in combating a " dangerous myth " I had n't heard of : that mothers and daughters resent each other . Ms. DeCrow eliminates the " usual " ( purported ) reasons , but then comes up with an even crazier one : The mother is the " tool " who teaches daughter , " You must please men to survive . " What nonsense ! I was an only child . My mother doted on me ! She has been dead 50 years , but even in the 1920s and 1930s , when I was growing up , she would not have taught me such a ridiculous idea . And her marriage to my dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects equal , and she was a feminist before there was such a word . I became one , too . My college major was physical science , encouraged by my dad , my first college chemistry teacher . Not surprisingly , I was the only female in many classes . At the age of 95 , I look back and realize I was a pioneer , but my blessed mother was one before me . She took the hard accomplishmentslike studying music at New England Conservatory while Dad was at Harvard , and teaching piano to help the family finances-for granted . Amending the U.S. Constitution so she could vote took a little longer ! - Mary C. ( Payne ) Brown Napa , CA POTENTIAL ASSETS Today I sent in my renewal form to your inspiring magazine , and I wanted to take a moment to say " Thank You ! " for your prison and domesticviolence shelter subscription program see below . Society seems to forget that prisoners are people too and all prisoners are not the same . Note that 85 percent of female prisoners are mothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greater majority of female prisoners did not live a life of crime ; rather , they made one or two poor choices . There are true criminals in prison , but many more with the potential to give back and be a positive asset to society . - Ramona Holderman Goodyear , AZ I am currently incarcerated , and within the prison walls there is a Safe Prisons Program that was created from the Prison Rape Elimination Act . Specific officers facilitate the program , but the inmates are actually the ones that make it work . We not only tell other inmates about disease and prevention , but about what it means to be healthy . I just recently came across your magazine and thought it was very interesting and informative . Not only have I used a part of it as a reference in a college essay but used some of the facts I learned from Ms. to teach a class . - Rene Vu Gatesville , TX Editors ' note : Readers can donate a year 's subscription of Ms. to a woman in prison or a domestic-violence sheltersee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ms. magazine , 433 S.
