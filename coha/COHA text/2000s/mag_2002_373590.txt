Gadgets that do it all rarely do it all well , but Kyocera 's new 7135 Smartphone , a combination cell phone and PDA , gives it a good shot . The compact clamshell runs Palm 's OS 4.1 on a color screen , and the stylus tucks neatly into a spot near its hinge . The Palm part of the 7135 is fine , but it truly stands out as a phone . It uses a regular keypad rather than a touchscreen , so it feels much more like a phone than its competitors , the Samsung I300 , Handspring Treo and T-Mobile Pocket PC Phone Edition . And the halves of the 7135 's brain work well together . Dial a number , and one click enters it in your Palm address book . Highlight and tap on a number from your Palm , and the phone dials it . At about $600 , it 's not cheaper than buying each separately , but at 6.6 oz. , it 's lighter . One catch : it wo n't be available until late fall .  --  By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
