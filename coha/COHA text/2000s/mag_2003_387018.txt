Section : WHO 'S NEXT <p> ELIOT SPITZER : Traders hate him . Republicans fear him . Even spam artists will soon dread his name . And he might just be the biggest bat on the national Democratic Party 's bench . An unlikely crusader unmasked . <p> Eliot Spitzer ca n't recall a specific moment when he realized he 'd become a phenomenon . " I 'm not sure you ever wake up and say , ' Gee , it 's different now ' , " he says . But if there was a moment like that , it might have been the day after Halloween , when a friend told him he saw someone the night before wearing a scary Eliot Spitzer mask . Or the morning he opened the newspaper to find his picture in the gossip column  --  next to Michael Jackson 's . " It was so weird , " he says . <p> Weird , maybe , but not quite unexpected . The attorney general of New York has n't exactly kept a low profile . Spitzer has used the once obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state 's , and country 's , most powerful institutions . He 's gone after crooked car dealers and gunmakers , the electric-power industry and sweatshop owners . His latest target : spammers . Last week Spitzer and Microsoft filed joint lawsuits against three marketing companies , charging they sent millions of fraudulent e-mails . Spitzer is seeking up to $20 million in fines . " We will drive them into bankruptcy , " he told reporters . <p> But it 's his crusade to expose Wall Street 's grimy side that has gotten the most attention , and not just in New York . In 2002 he revealed how some of the nation 's most respected investment firms cynically pushed on clients stocks that their own analysts had privately ridiculed . He forced the firms to pay a $1.4 billion settlement . In 2003 he tore into the mutual-fund industry for allowing big-dollar clients to make trades that were off-limits to ordinary investors . He 's now battling to force the funds to cut their fees , which Spitzer says are too high and soak average people . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most envied politicians in the country . He is hailed ( outside lower Manhattan , at least ) as a hero for the little guy  --  a straight-talking , law-and-order Democrat who tilts at windmills , and wins . In person he comes off as the smartest kid in the class , but not an irritating know-it-all . He sprinkles his sentences with legalese and odd anachronisms  --  he talks about the financial system 's being " torn asunder " and refers to greedy Wall Streeters as " plutocrats "  --  but somehow manages to come across as earnest and self-deprecating . He has an impressive knack for finding the camera , but does n't register as a shameless media hog . When he speaks of his achievements , he tends to use " we " instead of " I. " <p> Spitzer has become so popular that even Republicans , including New York Gov . George Pataki , have avoided criticizing him  --  if only because they do n't want to give him any more publicity . His most vocal enemies are chastened brokers and fund managers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is ruining our industry , " says one senior investment adviser for a major New York firm , who worries that now investors wrongly assume everyone on Wall Street is dishonest . " In a way , he 's doing the same thing the people at the funds did . Enriching himself at the expense of others . " ( If Americans are now more wary of Wall Street , it has n't seemed to have affected their appetite for buying in . According to the Investment Company Institute , through October 2003 investors had poured $186 billion into mutual funds  --  up 75 percent from the same period last year . ) Spitzer is used to the complaints . " If folks want to challenge my motivation , all I can say is we 're right on the facts . " <p> It 's no secret in New York that Spitzer is positioning himself to campaign for governor in 2006 . The attorney general himself seems to be the only one in the state who does n't know he 's running . " I have n't made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I 'd lose credibility if I did n't say I was thinking about it . " <p> Albany is n't likely to be his last stop . At 44 , Spitzer comes up on any Democrat 's shortlist of future presidential candidates ( something he says he has given no thought to at all ) . Joe Lieberman , John Kerry , Richard Gephardt and Wesley Clark have all gone to see him , hoping for his endorsement , NEWSWEEK has learned . Clark let it be known he 'd consider asking him to join his cabinet , or even to be his running mate . Spitzer is n't backing any of the candidates yet , though people close to him said he toyed with coming out for Kerry , who impressed him when they met . " Everyone is talking about him , not just Democrats , " says Donna Brazile , who managed Al Gore 's 2000 campaign . " What he does resonates with ordinary people . " <p> Spitzer would seem an unlikely champion of the common man . He grew up rich in Riverdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortune in real estate . He was intense , and a good student . He attended the exclusive Horace Mann School , then went on to Princeton and Harvard Law . But in the Spitzer household , privilege came with demands . " Though I had it very easy , " Spitzer says , " I knew that my dad had not , and that there was an expectation of hard work . " The atmosphere was proper : asked what kind of kid his son was , Spitzer 's father replied , " The application of the word ' normalcy ' would be appropriate . " Spitzer learned verbal combat at the dinner table , where the children were required to lead discussions about a chosen topic . His father , Spitzer says , was quick to pounce on any failure of fact or logic . " Every dinner was a debate forum . " Spitzer and his wife , Silda Wall , who was a law-school classmate , have similar  --  but less intimidating  --  round tables with their own three daughters . <p> After law school he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan , where he ran a sting operation to shut down the Gambino crime family 's stranglehold on trucks in the city 's garment district . He opened a fake sweatshop run by undercover cops and manned by real workers who did n't know the place was a setup . " Here is Eliot Spitzer , of Harvard Law School  --  he 's so proud showing me how good the buttonhole is that his workers have sewn , how good the zipper is , " says Michael Cherkasky , Spitzer 's former boss . " And I 'm thinking , Eliot , we 've gone too far with this . " <p> That kind of intensity can make Spitzer intimidating to work for . Those close to him say he is n't the kind of boss who lords over his underlings . But his temper can get frightening when he believes someone has let him down . " He only flashes it on the rarest of occasions , " says Cherkasky . " It 's ' I 'm trusting you to get this right . That 's your job . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with your sloppiness ' . " <p> Spitzer spent millions on his first attempt to become attorney general in 1994 , but lost . He won the second time out four years later , in a race so close it took six bitter weeks to count the votes . At first he worried that taking on the investment industry might actually spell the end of his political career . " He thought that it could absolutely dry up his financial resources to be an implacable enemy of Wall Street , " says a close friend . " He was crossing swords with his people  --  the Harvard people , the Princeton people , the people he grew up with . " <p> Spitzer admits he 's probably lost a few of his many friends who work on Wall Street . Cliff Sloan , a longtime friend , recalls Spitzer 's puncturing the tension at a dinner with a group of people who were upset with him . One of them asked why he had n't started eating , says Sloan . " He said he was waiting for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasional target of spontaneous rage . At a recent dinner party a woman walked up to him and threw a fit . " What you 're doing is outrageous ; it 's wrong , " she fumed . He listened politely , then deadpanned , " Where do you work ? " <p> If Spitzer does run for governor , he 's likely to face some tough competition . Rudy Giuliani is also said to want the job , and Spitzer may have to battle any number of Democrats  --  including popular Sen. Charles Schumer  --  for the nomination . But Spitzer has won a huge following of his own . One recent poll showed his approval rating at 62 percent  --  among Republicans . " The only thing he has n't done is advocate hanging an investment banker on a lamppost every night , " says former New York City mayor Ed Koch . " If he did that , he might sweep the election .
