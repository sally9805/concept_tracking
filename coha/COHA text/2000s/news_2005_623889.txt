<p> Christa Harrington was proud when she got her teaching job . <p> Four years of college and three of graduate school would give her a steady $38,000 salary with guaranteed raises , summers off and a solid retirement . <p> Together , she and her husband , Shawn , night supervisor at a major resort in Santa Cruz , make almost $70,000 , well above the state 's 2004 median family income of $58,327 . They had bright plans . <p> But they and thousands of other California families are finding that $50,000 , $60,000 or even $80,000 barely keeps them going . <p> " Shawn stays home with our kids in the day while I am at work , " Christa Harrington , who teaches special education to prekindergarten students and kindergartners in San Jose 's Franklin McKinley School District , said by e-mail . " I come home , and he goes to bed so that I can wake him up four to five hours later so that he can go to work . When he gets home in the morning , I walk out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromises the Harringtons , both 28 , have made  --  working different shifts to save on child care , renting a small house from a relative , cutting out vacations and even video rentals  --  have become essential . <p> Some middle-income Bay Area residents have seen mishaps like divorce , serious illness or a layoff make the difference between comfort and a financial struggle . <p> The bigger picture is that the gap between Americans with the highest and lowest incomes is growing . High-wage earners now have so much disposable income that they are pulling up prices for everyone , economists say , and that is stretching middle-income households . <p> Upper-income families  --  those earning more than 95 percent of Americans  --  went from making $95,737 a year in 1970 to $164,104 in 2001 , in constant dollars , a 72 percent increase . The very wealthiest Americans ' incomes rose even faster . But the median household income rose only 21 percent in constant dollars between 1970 and 2004 . And near-poor families  --  those with higher incomes than only 20 percent of American families  --  saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent increase between 1970 and 2001 . <p> And as households of other races began catching up with whites and Asians over the past decade , the median household income of white households rose more slowly  --  spreading economic pain to people not as accustomed to feeling it . <p> " We are currently considering putting our 2 1/2-year-old in preschool , " Christa Harrington said . " But it will only happen if the grandparents are willing to help us pay for it . " <p> Help from family <p> Contributions from relatives help many middle-income earners make it , even those who feel comfortable , like Tina Georgopoulos , a 28-year-old Oakland paralegal who makes about $55,000 . <p> Georgopoulos supports her 74-year-old father , Peter , and says more people would be content if they learned to stretch money further . She seldom goes out at night or on weekends , opting for free activities like nature hikes and walks on the beach  --  unlike some of her friends . <p> " I see them complain about bills and then they go out every night and blow their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a little ahead of the game at my age . I 've worked , and I 've saved my money . " <p> Georgopoulos also had $150,000 from the sale of her father 's San Ramon condominium for her down payment two years ago on the $435,000 four-bedroom house they share in San Ramon . Her mortgage and property taxes amount to $1,500 a month . <p> " I was just very fortunate , " Georgopoulos said . <p> The California Budget Project , a Sacramento nonprofit , estimates each year what director Jean Ross calls " one step above a bare-bones budget . " This year in the Bay Area , where costs are a bit higher than the statewide average , a single adult needs to earn $27,901 a year to pay for a basic standard of living ; a single parent with two children in day care , $62,969 ; and a two-parent family where one parent stays home with the kids , $55,740 . <p> The two-parent family 's monthly costs included : $1,871 for housing and utilities , $333 for transportation but no car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and $710 for food . Child care for the single-parent family was $1,256 a month , with one child in care only part time . <p> The plight of middle-income Americans is sometimes overlooked because the official poverty level , which the federal government has based since 1965 on three times an " economy " food budget , does not account for hikes in housing , energy or health care . <p> Even the gauge 's inventor , a U.S. Social Security Administration economist named Mollie Orshansky , wrote in 1966 that it would need constant adjustment as Americans ' standard of living changed . <p> Struggling middle class <p> Officially , the proportion of Americans living below the poverty level  --  which was $19,803 last year for a family of four with two children  --  has fallen . The number fell from 15 percent in 1982 , to 13.8 percent in 1995 , to 12.7 percent last year . <p> But many middle-income workers in California now spend half their earnings or more on mortgage and tax payments , according to an August study by the Public Policy Institute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic geography and chair of the California Studies Center at UC Berkeley , said the increasing wage disparity cements the gap in living standards because it is increasingly difficult for lower-income people to save at all . And that in turn has made homeownership one of the clearest dividing lines in California . <p> Consider Linda Knighten , who is raising her 16-year-old son , David , alone on her $40,000 salary as a cook at the Omni San Francisco Hotel . <p> " Every month , I 'm making choices as to what bill I 'm going to pay and what I 'm not going to pay , " Knighten said . <p> She drives a 1987 Volvo that makes strange noises because she does n't have the money to get it fixed . Seeking lower rent , she moved four years ago from San Francisco to Pittsburg , where she pays $1,100 a month in rent and utilities on a townhouse . She rides BART and spends about $200 a month in commute costs . <p> " I thought maybe I 'd be able to save enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's frustrating in the fact that you feel like you do n't get ahead . " <p> Rising gas prices and home costs have exacerbated the squeeze for all households over the past year , said Alice Rivlin , an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington and vice chair of the Federal Reserve from 1996 to 1999 . <p> Whites ' income grows slower <p> For whites , who saw their median household income rise just 7 percent between 1995 and 2004 , in constant dollars , the squeeze may feel a little tighter . Median household income for blacks rose 9 percent in the same period ; for Asians , 15 percent ; and for Hispanics of all races , 22 percent , according to the U.S. census . Non-Hispanic whites accounted for 72 percent of all American households . <p> The pain is all relative , though . White households were still better off than black households , where the median income was just 62 percent as high , and than Hispanic households , where the median income was 70 percent as high as in white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 17 percent higher than for white households . <p> Without a substantial down payment like Georgopoulos had , it is impossible for most middle-income workers to buy the median-priced Bay Area home , which cost $651,000 in August  --  more than three times the national median and almost 19 percent above August 2004 's price , according to the real estate research firm DataQuick . <p> Lou Maunupau , 47 , and his wife , Claudia Vlasakova , 37 , live in San Francisco 's Sunset District with their daughters , Olive , 3 , and Daisy , 2 , in a one-bedroom apartment they rent for $1,200 a month , just below the $1,229 fair market rent in San Francisco as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development . <p> The tennis and recreation director at Upper Noe Recreation Center , Maunupau has worked for the city since 1979 and puts in six or seven days a week to earn about $45,000 a year . Vlasakova 's new part-time job will bring in $9,000 a year . They take turns watching the kids . Their car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart . <p> The son of a postal worker and a yard and school bus monitor for San Francisco Unified School District , Maunupau said he ca n't see how he and his wife could have gotten further ahead . <p> " Homeownership is not even within the realm of possibility for us , " Maunupau said . " There 's this underclass of people , the sort of working-upper-poor or lower-middle-class who will never be homeowners . I consider myself one of those people . " <p> Maunupau said his native city seems to be driving out poor and middle-class families . But he loves San Francisco  --  Chinatown , North Beach , the nearby Marin Headlands  --  so much he ca n't imagine leaving . <p> " I 'm going to stay here until they kick me out , " Maunupau said . <p> Among those who have tried moving are Patrick Campbell , 37 , and his wife , Laurel Eby , 36 , who left San Francisco 's Noe Valley for San Jose three years ago so they could afford to buy a home . At 1,100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost $430,000 , and the combined mortgage , insurance and tax payment is about $2,500 a month . But it fit Eby , Campbell and their daughters , Zoe and Audrey , now 6 and 4 . <p> A year later , Campbell was laid off from his job at Silicon Graphics in Mountain View , Eby said . The family has managed to keep it together as Campbell became a self-employed video producer making about $80,000 . But they have racked up $8,000 in credit card debt and taken out a $46,000 line of credit on their home , which they tap when work is slow for Campbell or his clients are late paying . Because Campbell is self-employed , they must pay the full cost of their health insurance  --  $517 a month with a $750 annual deductible per person . <p> Matthew Fellowes , senior research associate with the Brookings Institution , said mortgage delinquencies , foreclosures and bankruptcies have all increased in recent years . Seventeen states and several cities have raised the minimum wage and now offer training programs for low-skilled workers , Fellowes said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vetoed a bill in late September to increase the minimum wage over two years from $6.75 an hour to $7.75 an hour  --  $16,120 a year for full-time work  --  and to tie future increases to inflation . Schwarzenegger said he supported a wage increase now but not automatic ones in the future . <p> " We 're essentially growing an economy that does n't work for as many people as it should , " Fellowes said . <p> No margin for error <p> Kerry Morning , 47 , and his wife Gina , 45 , saw their income plummet last year when Kerry Morning was injured at his job as an Alameda County probation officer . His $65,000 annual salary  --  $5,417 a month  --  was replaced by a little under $3,500 a month in taxable disability payments . <p> To keep up with the $3,000-a-month mortgage and taxes on the house they bought for $598,000 in Richmond in 2002 , as well as their car payment and utility bills , Gina Morning turned the odd jobs she used to do for extra cash into a business . She now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , driving students to school , caring for kids during the summer and sewing costumes and clothes with African-style prints . <p> " Everything I did before that was a pleasure , " Gina Morning said . " Now it 's like I have to get out there and really hustle . <p> " We 've cut back on the movies , things we used to do every Friday night . Eating out once a month , we do n't do that anymore , " she said . The children " do n't really know the struggles we 're going through . " <p> Kerry Morning said , " We just have to be real diligent about how we do things . We have to make our own entertainment and what we do with our kids . Before , we did n't have as many restrictions on us . " <p> He hopes to be cleared to work again soon but does not think he 'll return to his probation job , which he held for 22 years .
