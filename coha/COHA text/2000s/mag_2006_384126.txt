It 's not just about electricity . To slash water-heating bills , start with sunlight and lots of copper tubing . Here 's how . // Located a few steps outside our basement door , partially obscured by cherry whips and spruce boughs , are four 100-gal. propane tanks , all linked to each other and to a water heater in the basement . To a family living off the grid , relying on solar energy and trying hard to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels , the tanks are an eyesore . They represent a measure of defeat in terms of self-sufficiency , not to mention a financial drag . We do appreciate the technology , though . Before we installed our propane water heater in 1999 , we were living with cold showers-a rough situation up here in northern Vermont . The hot water was a luxury . For two days , we even argued over who got to do the dishes . Since then , we 've managed to empty our propane tanks every nine or 10 months , for an annual hit of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks . When it came time to try something better , we quickly decided on a solar hot-water system . To most people , " solar power " means photovoltaic panels that produce electricity . That 's a shame , because solar hot-water systems actually make better use of the sun 's energy and offer a quicker return on the investment , which can range from about $6000 to twice that . " It baffles me , " says Peter Allen , founder and president of Thermo Dynamics ( www.thermo-dynamics.com ) , a Canadian company we turned to for help with the project . " A kilowatt of photovoltaics costs about $7000 ; a kilowatt 's worth of hot-water system is about $2000 . " A solar system would n't be able to extinguish the propane heater 's pilot light altogether . But we hoped it would help us slash our fuel use-without jeopardizing our hot showers . The technology is fairly simple . We have a pair of collectors , big boxes that measure 4 x 8 ft. long and are about 4 in. thick . The collectors use sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar boiler ( essentially a heat exchanger ) in the basement where it gives up precious energy to unheated well water . The water flows to an 80-gal. preheat tank ( an unplugged electric water heater ) before arriving at our propane hotwater tank . The system is a " preheat , solar boiler " setup , meaning that the propane heater is always available to boost the water temperature on overcast days . We installed our system in late October 2005 , at the start of our annual four-month near exile from the sun . It took three of us about three days to do the work , which included using 2 ? 4s to make simple mounting brackets for the collectors . We lagged them to the southfacing wall of the house , rather than placing them on the roof , making for easier snow removal . Eventually , we 'll put a sunroom underneath the collectors and they 'll be moved to that roof . The next step was running the copper that ushers the glycol from the collectors to the solar boiler in the basement . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running it down the outside wall inside pipe insulation before drilling through the box sill to access the basement . The most time-consuming process was plumbing the tanks together . Admittedly , this would have gone a heck of a lot quicker if I had n't insisted on sweating some of the joints myself . Still , quite a maze of copper connects the heat exchanger to the preheat tank , and the preheat tank to both the propane heater and a cold-water supply . It was a week before we realized any hot water from the system , but when it finally happened , I was stunned at the speed . By noon on a cold November day , we were dumping 120 F water into our preheat tank . Since our propane heater was set to deliver 130 F water , we were burning almost no propane . We did two loads of laundry and gave our toddler boys baths to celebrate . Because we have n't filled the tanks since installing the system , it 's tough to know exactly how much propane we 're saving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much , " although Peter Allen is more optimistic . He estimates we could be reducing our propane consumption by 25 percent in winter . Come the 14-hour days of summer , our system should provide at least 80 percent of our needs . " I 've gone from mid-March to mid-October strictly on my solar hot water , " says Alien , who lives in Nova Scotia , in a climate similar to northern Vermont 's . Averaged over the entire year , our propane use could drop by 50 percent , saving us up to $500 , assuming a propane price of two bucks a gallon . At that rate , it would take just under 15 years for the system to pay for itself . But we 're taking it one year at a time . Come June , we expect the element in our propane water heater to be blessedly cool . And the water coming out of the tap ? hot enough to make up for every cold , off-the-grid shower we 've ever endured .
