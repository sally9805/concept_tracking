There is a word that gets attached to elusive international villains . The word is shadowy . Carlos the Jackal was shadowy . Abu Nidal was shadowy . One of the novelties of Osama bin Laden is that he is hardly shadowy at all . There is little mystery about bin Laden 's life except his precise whereabouts now . For a terrorist ringleader , he has given a remarkable number of interviews . He has even played host at a press conference . Bin Laden has talked articulately about his history , his outlook , his strategy to defeat the U.S. What he has n't told journalists he has laid out in fairly eloquent treatises . While the world was surprised by what bin Laden or his associates did on Sept. 11 , it can not be surprised by his intentions . These have been made clear for years by his many pronouncements . <P> WHAT 'S HE AFTER ? <P> Bin Laden 's ambitions in the short run are plain . His first goal is to compel the U.S. to withdraw its military forces ( today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of foreign troops in the cradle of Islam is , for him , " the latest and the greatest " of all infidel aggressions against the religion in its 14-century history . By their very presence , he believes , the U.S. forces defile the Muslim holy land . " Now infidels walk everywhere on the land where Muhammad was born and where the Koran was revealed to him , " he lamented to TIME in a 1998 interview . <P> Because the U.S. troops are in Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the Saudi government , which was frightened into the move by a threat of invasion by Iraq 's Saddam Hussein in 1990 , the Saudi regime , says bin Laden , " is fully responsible " for their presence . Thus he has called on his countrymen to overthrow the House of Saud . Still , he has targeted his attacks not on the rulers but on the Americans , noting that " the American enemy is the main cause of the situation . " <P> To bin Laden , the U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . Asked by CNN in 1997 whether their withdrawal would appease him , he said no . The holy war will not stop , he said , until the U.S. " desists from aggressive intervention against Muslims in the whole world . " Bin Laden counts as unacceptable the American military presence in other Arab states , including Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates and Egypt . He is offended by continued U.S. sanctions against Iraq as well as Syria , Sudan , Libya and Iran . And he objects to America 's substantial support of Israel , which he considers a partner to the U.S. in a " Jewish-Crusader " conspiracy against Muslims . <P> Bin Laden stretches his definition of American aggression further . He blames the U.S. for the killing of Bosnian Muslims by Christian Serbs because of a U.N . arms embargo against Bosnia until 1994 . He even counts in this category the 1992-94 mission by U.S. troops to mostly Muslim Somalia as part of a U.N . effort to assist a famine-starved population caught between battling warlords . In bin Laden 's book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. " to scare the Muslim world , saying that it is able to do whatever it desires . " He asked , " How can we believe your claims that you came to save our children in Somalia while you kill our children in all those other places ? "  --  meaning Iraq , Bosnia and , through the Israelis , Lebanon and the Palestinian territories . <P> AND THEN WHAT ?
