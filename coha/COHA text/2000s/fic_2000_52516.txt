waited a moment , face flushed with heat , sweat streaking across her charcoal face , eye whites bright with adrenaline as she made sure that Wylie and I had escaped the tinderbox pine forest . Wylie 's thick braid hung heavy halfway down his back . He faced the flames separating us from Rain and the river behind her . Wylie took a deep breath and looked back at me . Our eyes met only an instant before he clasped the leather pouch at his neck , then turned and raced toward her with a baying cry . <p> All day we had dodged the fire that woke our campsite , battled our way beside the flames , searching for a Florida spring , a creek or riverbed not dusty and parched by this summer drought , and I found myself making deals with God . Caught in that morning 's blaze , my own shaky religion had returned . I stood agnostic with a prayer , then I , too , barreled through the last torching stand of brush and trees before the shallow leg of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy-train-engine steam up from each footfall in the black mud on the other side of the fire . My shoes met the water with a mad snake 's hiss , soles hit the gravel creek bottom and quickly cooled , conforming to the shape of my feet . I flexed my toes , making room to allow the cold water to penetrate the canvas of my tennis shoes , to soothe the hot fevered blisters worn raw , but now so cool , a reminder that my own two feet were still at the end of my scorched legs . <p> Rain and Wylie lay in the shallow current . Wylie 's T-shirt still smoked , singed on the dark collar that swirled dusky to black across the peeling decal on its front : an owl tangled in a plastic six-pack holder lay feet-in-the-air before a clear-cut forest , the caption " Give a hoot " was barely legible behind the smoky stains . Wylie 's chest rose and fell in heavy breaths , his lungs seemed close to caving in , then expanded , lifting his body from the waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convince myself . " All three of us . " <p> The water covered Rain 's body , save the tips of her leather boots , her nose , and forehead . The clear creek splashed and beaded into opaque pools on their gray skin . Beneath the water the current cleansed , revealed hard goose flesh that glistened in the sun . <p> Rain bolted upright , hazel eyes alarmed , she looked at me with disbelief then recognition . The circle of my vision narrowed around that expression until I heard the splash of my collapse . I heard Wylie 's voice ask , " Martin ? " <p> And in the silence that followed his question , I could hear the fire still crackling beside us , but my nose found an inch of clean air above the water 's surface , and I inhaled . And then I exhaled . <p> I woke with my head on the other shore where Wylie must have dragged me to keep me from drowning . My legs still hung in the water , and tiny minnows kissed , kissed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My head was heavy when I tried to raise it . The sun 's reflection on the surface or the sun itself churned around in a drying cycle . Or maybe it was the fire , still burning , still chasing us . The sudden motion made me heave and sneeze an ungodly water , a fuliginous gray stew thick with tubes like black licorice . <p> I did n't even lift my arms to wipe the spit aside . I imagined Rain coming back for me . She and Wylie would stand above me , whispering last rites , quietly making plans for my burial until Wylie notices some small movement , only a twitch in one of my fingers at the water 's edge that tells him I 'm not wholly dead . Then he would kneel to reach my smoky , spit-strewn face and gently cup my mouth to his to breathe back life . And life would come back . Slowly . Beginning at my toes and moving up , like the scent of a single candle in a large room , until my mouth comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet by his tongue or perspiration , and I open my eyes . Saved . <p> But they are still not here . <p> When Rain and Wylie do come back it is much later . They have gathered dehydrated wild oranges , and Rain tells Wylie the water will refresh them . She promises him this . She sees my eyes are open and drops the miniature sun fruits and comes to me quickly . Her hands are sweet with secret oils stolen from the oranges ' dry and dented rinds . <p> Rain tries to comfort me and tells me she is glad that I 'm okay . She was worried . They both were worried , she tells me . She has seen death take a person before . Her mother back in Seattle so far away from her now . <p> I do n't tell her she is frightening me . I do n't ask her why then , why she and Wylie left me alone . I do n't tell her I love her when she bends down to kiss my cheeks , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low " No " and catch her by the tiny wrists , place her sweet citrus hands back over my lips , and it is then that I return her kiss . <p> Wylie stands above me , a giant sundial reminding us that the daylight is deceiving . It is later than it seems . His dark face has been cleaned , and he is smiling . <p> Wylie and I hooked up in El Paso , we were both passing through . He was older than me by four years , twenty-one , and said he was from Montana , a place I 'd never been . I was so drunk when he told me he was Crow that I thought he was drunk , too , thinking he could fly . He was dark , yes , with hair black as those feathers , but he had laughed and shook his head . No , he said . He did n't drink anymore , and I thought , Anymore ? No more at twenty-one ? <p> I told him drinking was my hobby , and I had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was I even old enough to drink . <p> I had thought then about telling him I 'd been robbed , that I had money at home somewhere , had been kidnapped and escaped , had a family who loved me , were looking for me , were worried . But something about Wylie , that dry day in El Paso , made me tell him the truth . That I did n't have any money , that I was n't old enough to drink , that I did n't have much anyplace to go . <p> When I told him how I 'd gotten there , how the truck driver who 'd picked me up would rub against me when we slept behind the big seats of the cab , Wylie only nodded . He said I could travel with him if I wanted . He had met some hippies with a van , and they promised to meet him in the morning at the Remember the Alamo Cafe . They were going to Austin , and he heard it was n't nearly as hot there . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cool place to stay for a spell . Wylie said that I could go with him . <p> We met Rain in Austin . She was just like us , wandering . But she had a car , an old Dodge swinger that a man had given her , she said , and she shared it with us , but mostly we slept outside . Sometimes Rain and Wylie slept together in the back seat , and I knew what they were doing but pretended to sleep . <p> How could I sleep ? I lay frozen with jealousy but did n't know who I was jealous of , Wylie or Rain , or whether I was just jealous they were getting to do it at all . They both attracted me , were soft-skinned and smooth , so different from the coarse truck driver whose hairy face and limbs felt as if they were slicing me beneath him . And both Wylie and Rain touched me , were affectionate and aware of me . They were mother and father . I could n't say no when they asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them anywhere . Either one of them . This was the first time I had fallen in love . <p> I had had crushes all my life . On girls who teased then ran away . On the boys who bullied me after school , the boys who ordered me around , roughhousing our way home to the trailer park in Ohio where I lived with my mother and stepfather . But Wylie and Rain I loved differently . They took care of me . <p> Rain 's car broke down near Ocala , where we camped in the national forest . When we walked away from the Dodge , she said they were probably looking for it by now , anyway , and I did n't ask . Because Rain so often shared such intimate details of her life  --  especially late at night when only the two of us were left awake , when she 'd whisper how her mother howled against death , how her father had hit Rain and told her to grow up and quit crying and how she did quit crying , how she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle before she scraped enough money together to leave for good  --  that when the details of her lives did n't always add up , I immediately forgave her . I knew that sometimes lies were necessary , and I had invented my own histories , had happier childhoods . Sadder ones . <p> So when Wylie suggested we walk west-he was sure we 'd find work on a fishing boat or wharf along the coast-I followed them . <p> The fire was far away from us the next time I woke , and I chewed the willow leaves Wylie said would calm my stomach . Even though the water was all gone from me , had been expelled from every opening like a rolled-over sponge , my belly still clinched , and my body would jerk and twitch in syncopated seizures . <p> Wylie told me to think about the trees when I chewed the leaves . He told me to think about the trees in the dry forest around us , to try and imagine their roots stretching down into the earth like long fingers . The willow leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was full of water , full of fire . Out of balance . He said chew the leaves . If we had a pot he would make tea , he said . He would get a pot when we came to a town . But I would have to get better so we could find a town . He would steal a cup if we came to another campground , but I would have to get better first . I had to get better soon because we needed to move , we needed to find work and decent food , we needed to get to the coast . " Chew the leaves , " he said . <p> We were never sure if I had caught fever or not , we were all so hot and exhausted from the battle with fire . Rain soaked her T-shirt in the river and wrung the water on my lips . Wylie brought more leaves and found roots and acorns we could eat and that I could keep down . I felt ready to move , and then slowly , we walked our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled a covey of volunteer firemen who were out in the forest scouting for fires . They told us there were wildfires in every county in Florida , save one far up to the north . They radioed to the Red Cross about us , would get us to a road in the morning where an ambulance would take us to a hospital . They fed us U.S. Army rations of Swiss steak , English peas in tiny square tins . <p> I watched how the men stared at Rain , who kept solid and silent . They looked at Wylie , questioning his origin . At me , I 'm not sure what they made of me . I was still too weak to talk when the firemen asked us again how we came to be in the smoking woods , but I nodded when they said we were lucky to be alive . <p> Wylie told them we had been camping , were forced to flee a sudden fire 's rage . They wanted to know more . " Where ? Which campground ? " <p> When Wylie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking on foot for days before the fire , the men looked sideways at each other , nodded knowingly with their lips poked out and asked if we had been smoking marijuana . If we had an illegal campfire that accidentally started the blaze . They expected confession , and Wylie offered them none . We had n't started the fire . <p> What were we doing there ? <p> Camping only . <p> They would get to the bottom of this . <p> Wylie asked if we were free to go . <p> I could have screamed at him then , I was so tired from walking . But I was afraid of what the men might do if they knew no one was looking for us . If they would point us to the nearest town , the nearest road , we would continue , Wylie said . We all three thanked them for the food , for the chance to rest . <p> The next day on the road we were picked up by a preacher and his wife . They were dressed for Sunday , and Wylie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived in Cedar Key . It was the first I 'd heard of a specific destination . Wylie told them about the fire and how we had been separated from our car and our things . <p> The preacher and his wife were so worried for us that they turned around and took us to their two-story house , where the preacher called the church on his telephone . He looked at his watch and said he would n't be able to make it in time for the early service . A minor emergency had come up , he said , and yes , everything was all right , but it did require his immediate attention . The preacher and his wife wanted to call Wylie 's auntie and let her know that we were fine , but his auntie did n't have a phone , he said . Rain and I were brother and sister and were known to be on a two-week beach vacation . There was no one worried or looking for us , there was no one to call . <p> But our clothes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what about our IDs ? Everything had been left in flames at the camp , Wylie told them . We had been sleeping in the tent when the fire caught us unaware . We had managed to escape with our shoes and the clothes on our backs . We barely made it through the heat , he said , but the Lord had taken care of us in the woods and as soon as we got to the coast , Wylie 's Aunt Ada would fix us back up . <p> The preacher 's wife nodded at this . God certainly took care of His faithful , she said . She said Ada sounded like a lovely woman , and did she have a church ? The preacher and his wife offered to feed us , then made a bed for Rain in a guest room . They never had any children , the preacher said . His wife could n't . She gave Rain shorts and a clean T-shirt . The preacher 's clothes hung from me , but it felt so good to take a real shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church building , or maybe the preacher would drive over that very afternoon and see what clothes were there in the Goodwill drive his wife had organized . It was as if God had given her a special insight that there would be travelers coming through in need , the preacher said . <p> Wylie said something we assumed to be a Crow prayer , then told the preacher 's wife she was a true daughter of the Lord . This pleased her to no end . She had always expected that God would lead her to save the American Indians . Wylie said they sure needed it . The preacher had insisted his work was here in Florida , where the preacher 's wife understood there were no more Indians at all . Wylie whispered to her there were plenty of Indians in Florida . There were Miccosukees and Seminoles on southern reservations , he said . The preacher 's wife shook her head , she could n't believe it . <p> " How long is the drive to the Everglades ? " she asked the preacher . How far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were Creeks , too , Muskogees scattered all over . He even knew of a Crow woman living on Cedar Key . The preacher 's wife asked if she could drive us to Aunt Ada 's . <p> Wylie told such great stories that I imagined we really were going there . His large old auntie was such a fine cook and had such a hearty , good-natured laugh . I could n't wait to meet her . <p> That evening the preacher 's wife made a pallet on the living room floor for me and Wylie . The cool pillowcases were crisp from the clothesline , and the giveaway clothing the preacher retrieved from the church was more than we had worn in days . Rain told us later that she hardly could sleep in the big soft bed . Years had passed since she 'd worn a nightgown . But that evening I slept so soundly , curled against Wylie , who in turn , curled against me in the absence of Rain . <p> I 'm not sure if I still believe it now  --  more often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm certain I believed it that night on the preacher 's floor , when Wylie told me he would take care of us forever . And Wylie did take care of us for the rest of that hot dry summer . He took care of Rain for eight more years after that . I moved out west and worked my way through college . I heard they married then divorced . I had n't talked to either one of them in years . <p> And now , twelve years later in my north Oregon home , I wait through the wet months of spring , planting bulbs in the garden with my wife and our daughter , waiting for the sprouts to rise from the earth through the air toward the sun and open . I wait for the warm Indian summer to lead me again on my annual pilgrimage to the Montana plains , where I camp by myself and remember . <p> My daughter says she is big enough to go with me this year , but I shake my head and tell her no . Daddy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe one of these days you 'll find it , " my wife says somewhat sadly , and I stand up and take her in my arms , and I kiss her . Try to reassure her . But she knows there is something missing . She knows I am always searching again for the balance when I go searching for the absence of rain . <p> <p> By Chip Livingston <p>
