<p> FEATURED LETTER <p> How many know that , thanks to President Ronald Reagan , more than a million people visit the banks and surrounding region of Illinois ' own Illinois &; Michigan Canal ? More than 80 miles of recreational trails and greenways and more than 60 natural , cultural and historic sites in the Illinois &; Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor beckon tourists . It is all part of the Reagan legacy . <p> In 1984 , flanked by Gov . James Thompson and Sen. Charles Percy , President Reagan sat in the Chicago Hilton and signed legislation creating the I &M; Canal National Heritage Corridor . Illinois civic and business leaders , and state and local officials , who worked long and hard for that moment , looked on . They knew the designation would provide national recognition for the historic Illinois &; Michigan Canal and would be the impetus to revive rust-belt communities along the 96-mile waterway . <p> The 450-square-mile I &M; Canal National Heritage Corridor threads together 49 communities , from Chicago to LaSalle-Peru  --  all bound by the hand-dug waterway that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final link in America 's great water highway system of the 19th century . Creation of the national heritage corridor brought together diverse interests  --  from government entities , to corporate CEOs and economic development executives , to historic preservationists and environmentalists  --  to work toward a shared vision for the unique resources " in their own backyard . " <p> Now , two decades after Reagan created it , the I &M; Canal National Heritage Corridor is indeed an economic engine . Once-struggling canal towns thrive with quaint downtowns dotted with antique shops , mom-and-pop cafes , four-star restaurants and B &Bs.; Tourism is flourishing . <p> What 's more , with creation of the I &M; Canal National Heritage Corridor , Reagan helped launch a movement that is alive and well today . Modeled after our own heritage corridor , there are now 23 other national heritage areas across the country , celebrating local history and revitalizing communities . <p> For a reminder of Reagan 's impact on Illinois  --  and beyond  --  just visit the I &M; Canal National Heritage Corridor . <p> Ana B. Koval , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockport <p> LETTER TO THE EDITOR <p> Greeley and the ' Big Lie ' <p> In the title of his June 11 column , Andrew Greeley poses what he clearly feels to be a valid question : " Is U.S. like Germany of the ' 30s ? " With an eye toward clearing up Greeley 's confusion , a brief primer : <p> *Bush 's " Big Lie " ( to borrow Greeley 's term ) led to the liberation of more than 20 million Iraqis from a murderous regime ; Hitler 's " Final Solution " led to the murder of some 6 million Jews . <p> *Under the Bush administration , syndicated columnists are free to explore the putative similarities between our president and one of history 's most notorious tyrants ; under the Third Reich , it is safe to assume that such discourse would have been discouraged . <p> But let us not pass judgment . As Greeley writes , we are " not God " and are therefore ill-equipped to do so  --  although Greeley is charitable enough to judge Rumsfeld , Ashcroft , Rove and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goering and Goebbels . But perhaps some other questions should be asked : <p> *Is " Bush equals Hitler " what passes for reasoned commentary these days ? <p> *Could Greeley possibly believe what he wrote ? <p> Jim Flanagan , Plainfield <p> Courageous comparison <p> Kudos to Andrew Greeley 's comparison of the modern-day United States to Germany in the 1930s . It was a straightforward and courageous article , for which I 'm sure he 'll receive his share of contradictory mail . I just wanted to be counted among those who agree . <p> Jill Petillo , Irving Park <p> Doctors bypass real issues <p> I see a huge disconnect in what the AMA says and how it serves its customers : the American public " Fat-fighting proposals on the table at AMA 's annual meeting here , " metro story , June 14 . <p> The American Medical Association takes stands on such things as smoke-free prisons and prison interrogation in foreign countries . Is it afraid of taking a stand on critical issues that affect the health care of U.S. citizens , such as drug prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers ca n't discriminate against individual applicants , especially those between 55 and 65 ? What about telling the American public about the true cost of drugs , which are 66 percent to 75 percent lower than any Medicare discount cards display ? <p> Apparently physicians  --  at least those who support the AMA  --  are afraid to tackle real health care issues . <p> Beth Lisberg Najberg , <p> Near North Side <p> Penalizing medical victims <p> The editorial on the medical crisis ( June 9 ) was more fluff than fact . Any bill attempting to address the rising cost of malpractice insurance must address all facets of the problem , including lack of accountability in the medical profession and mismanagement by the insurers . Both contribute to higher premiums . <p> ISMIE Mutual Insurance Co. , a physician-owned insurer , is taking in more money today while its payouts have remained roughly the same over the past decade , according to the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association , based on its review of ISMIE 's annual reports . As to doctors fleeing the state , the Illinois Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shows an increase over last year . And the American Medical Association does not track physicians by state . One can not claim there is a grand exodus based on selected interviews any more than one can claim there is a lawsuit problem when one large award catches the media 's attention . <p> As a trial lawyer who represents victims of medical negligence , it is disheartening to hear those who would place the burden of solving this complex problem squarely and solely on those who are truly innocent and genuinely in need  --  the patients who received substandard care and paid for it with their lives or their health . <p> Debra A. Thomas , Glen Ellyn <p> Fitting tribute to the Gipper <p> I think it is wise to resist the urge to rename every object and landmark imaginable to honor Ronald Reagan . The most appropriate honor would be to rename Alzheimer 's disease , as Ronald Reagan 's disease . <p> William Resseguie , <p> Logan Square <p> Ray of sunshine <p> I met Ray Charles four times while I worked at O'Hare Airport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him was unexpected  --  a red eye from LAX arrived where I was waiting , and the first person off the plane was Ray . I spontaneously said , " Hey , Ray , do n't let the sun catch you crying , " and he said , " I hear ya , baby ! " and flashed that famous grin of his . <p> Ronald K. Marsh , <p> Auburn Gresham <p> Soulful national anthem ? <p> Ray Charles , American persona , is gone . More than any president , here is a man who represented all Americans . He never fired union workers , never invaded another country for big business , never sent young lads to foreign countries to protect large companies . <p> Ray Charles ' rendition of " America , the Beautiful " should be at least the alternate , if not official , national anthem of this great country of ours . Rarely would millions of Americans toss on the CD player a speech of a politician , but there will be millions who are gon na play " I 'm Busted " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oak Park <p> Wrong target in drug war <p> As a Chicagoan who lives in Bogota , I was disappointed by the way the June 6 article " Colombia 's killing fields claiming lives in Chicago " misrepresented Bogota and America 's drug war in Colombia . Bogota is a city where U.S. Embassy staff and contractors have to be on guard , true . Private U.S. citizens , on the other hand , can feel secure and at home in this family-oriented city that , like Chicago , is proud of its bike paths and city parks . <p> Next , the crops that are processed into drugs in Colombia are usually grown by dirt-poor peasants who ca n't make a living from any other crop . Even worse , they are threatened with death by the FARC guerrillas if they do n't grow . These peasants are just struggling to get work and stay alive . If Chicago wants to end its drug problem , we do n't need to attack Colombian peasants . Instead , we must prevent " affluent high schoolers " from getting into drugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nation has to cut the farm subsidies that make American farm products artificially cheap . Only when the demand for drugs falls and Colombian peasants have the possibility to export legal crops to the United States will we stop losing our best cops and our city 's teens to the " war on drugs . " <p> Jessica Wade-Murphy , <p> Bogota , Colombia <p> MY TWO CENTS <p> " Under the Bush administration , syndicated columnists are free to explore the putative similarities between our president and one of history 's most notorious tyrants ; under the Third Reich , it is safe to assume that such discourse would have been discouraged .
