Deep in the Brazilian back country , circa 1910 , two families engage in a vendetta . The Breves are poor and losing the fight . One of their sons ( Rodrigo Santoro ) runs from it , finds love with a traveling entertainer ( Flavia Marco Antonio ) , but not without bleak consequences . This movie is more emotionally remote than Salles ' fine Central Station . But it is starkly beautiful and says something potent to a world in which nations , like these families , engage in mindless blood feuds . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
