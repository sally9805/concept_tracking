But strength alone , though of the Muses born , Is like a fallen angel : trees uptorn , Darkness , and worms , and shrouds , and sepulchers Delight it ; for it feeds upon the burrs And thorns of life ; forgetting the great end Of poesy , that it should be a friend To soothe the cares , and lift the thoughts of man . Keats California , 1850 Angel pushed the canvas flap back just enough to look out at the mud street . She shivered in the cold afternoon air , that carried with it the stench of disenchantment . Pair-a-Dice lay in the Mother Lode of California . It was the worst place she could have imagined , a shanty town of golden dreams built out of rotting sails from abandoned ships ; a camp inhabited by outcasts and aristocrats , the displaced and dispossessed , the once-pampered and now-profane . Canvas-roofed bars and gambling houses lined mean streets ruled by unmasked depravity and greed , loneliness and grand illusions . Pair-a-Dice was wild jubilation . It wed black despair with fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel saw on one corner a man preaching salvation while on the other his brother , hat in hand , fleeced the godforsaken . Everywhere she looked , there were desperate men , exiled from home and family , seeking escape from the purgatory forged by their own decaying hopes for a future . These same fools called her a Cyprian and sought solace where they were most assured of finding nonefrom her . They drew lots for her favors , fourounces of gold , payable in advance to the Duchess , madam of the Palace , the tent brothel where she lived . Any comer could have Angel for one half hour . Her own meager percentage would be kept under lock and key and guarded by a woman-hating giant named Magowan . As for the restthose sad unfortunates who lacked the price to sample her talentsthey stood knee-deep in a sea of mud called Main Street , waiting for a chance glimpse of " the Angel . " And she lived a year in a month in this place that was unfit for anything but business . When would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her here , to this horrible place of dirt and broken dreams ? " No more right now , " the Duchess was saying , ushering several men away . " I know you 've been waiting , but Angel 's tired , and you want her best , do n't you ? " Men complained and threatened , pleaded and bargained , but the Duchess knew when Angel had reached the limit of her endurance . " She needs a rest . Come back this evening . Drinks on the house . " Relieved that they were gone , Angel let go of the tent flap and went back to lie on the rumpled bed . She stared bleakly at the canvas ceiling . The Duchess had announced this morning at breakfast that the new building was almost finished and the girls would be moving in tomorrow . Angel was ready to have four walls around her again . At least then the cold night wind would not blow in on her through splits in the rotting sailcloth . She had n't thought how much four walls meant to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , all she had been thinking was escape . All she had seen was her chance for freedom . The mirage had dissolved soon enough when she reached the gangplank and learned she was one of three women aboard a ship with 120 vigorous young men , all of whom had nothing on their minds but adventure . The two hard-eyed prostitutes set to work right away , but Angel had tried to stay in her cabin . Within a fortnight , she saw clearly that she had one simple choice : go back to being a prostitute or be raped . What did it really matter anyway ? What else did she know ? She might as well line her pockets with gold like the others . Maybe then , just maybe , with enough money she could buy freedom . She survived the rough seas , the foul-tasting lobscouse and hushama-grundy , the cramped quarters , and lack of dignity and decency in the hope that she would have enough money by the time she reached the shores of California to start a new life . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was struck . The two other prostitutes set upon her in her cabin . By the time she regained consciousness , they were ashore with all her money and every possession she owned . All that was left to her was the clothes on her back . What was worse , not even one sailor remained aboard to row her ashore . Beaten and numb with confusion , she sat huddled in the bow of the ship for two days before scavengers came . When they finished taking what they wanted from the deserted ship and her , they brought her to the dock . It was raining hard , and while they argued and divided their booty , she simply walked away . She wandered for several days , hiding her face and hair beneath a soiled blanket one of the men had given her . She was hungry ; she was cold ; and she was resigned . Freedom was a dream . She made her way by working Portsmouth Square until the Duchess , a woman well past her prime but possessed of a shrewd mind for business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold country . " I 've got four other girls , a Frenchie from Paris , a Celestial Ah Toy sold me , and two girls who look like they came off an empty potato boat from Ireland . A little food will fatten ' em up . Ah , but now , you . First time I saw you , I thought there 's a girl who can get rich with the right management . A girl with your beauty could make her fortune up there in the gold camps . Those young miners will take the gold out of the stream and fight each other to put it right in your hand . " On an agreement that Angel would turn over eighty percent of her earnings , the Duchess promised to see that she was protected from bodily harm . " And I 'll see you have the best clothing , food , and lodgings available . " Angel found the irony laughable . She had fled from Duke and fallen into the hands of Duchess . Just her luck . For all her seeming benevolence , Duchess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix the lots , while not a speck of that gold dust found its way into the girls ' pouches . The tips left for services well-rendered were divided according to the original agreement . Mai Ling , Ah Toy 's Celestial slave girl , tried to hide her gold once , and Magowanwith his cruel smile and ham-sized handswas sent in to " have a talk with her . " Angel hated her life . She hated the Duchess . She hated Magowan . She hated her own wretched helplessness . Most of all she hated the men for their relentless quest for pleasure . She gave them her body but not a particle more . Maybe there was n't any more . She did n't know . And that did n't seem to matter to any of the men . All they saw was her beauty , a flawless veil wrapped around a frozen heart , and they were enthralled . They looked into her angel eyes and were lost . She was not fooled by their endless declarations of love . They wanted her in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lusted for her . They fought for the chance to be with her . They scrambled , grappled , gambled , and grabbedand everything they had was spent without thought or consideration . They paid to become enslaved . She gave them what they thought was heaven and consigned them to hell . What did it matter ? She had nothing left . She did n't care . An even stronger force than the hatred that feasted on her was the weariness that sucked her soul dry . At eighteen , she was tired of living and resigned to the fact that nothing would ever change . She wondered why she had even been born . For this , she supposed . Take it or leave it . God 's truth . And the only way to leave it was to kill herself . Every time she faced that fact , every time she had the chance , her courage failed . Her only friend was a tired old harlot named Lucky , who was running to fat because of her thirst for brandy . Yet even Lucky knew nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened to make her the way she was . The other prostitutes thought of her as invulnerable . They all wondered about her , but they never asked questions . Angel made it clearly understood from the beginning that the past was sacred ground no one walked over . Except for Lucky , dumb-drunk Lucky for whom Angel held a fondness . Lucky spent her off time deep in her cups . " You got ta have plans , Angel . You got ta hope for something in this world . " " Hope for what ? " " You ca n't get by any other way . " " I get by just fine . " " How ? " " I do n't look back , and I do n't look forward . " " What about now ? You got ta think about now , Angel . " Angel smiled faintly and brushed her long , golden hair . " Now does n't exist . "
