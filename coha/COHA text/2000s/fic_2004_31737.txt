Chapter One Shadow smelled it first . He lay on the living-room floor at his owner 's feet , sprawled on his left side with a rawhide chew bone a whisker 's length from his nose . He 'd worked the knot for a while earlier , massaging his gums , as close as he was likely to get to the satisfaction of gnawing fresh , warm meat from the bones of a kill . Now the comforting scents - the half-chewed bone ; the master 's feet wrapped in old leather slippers ; the rug still rich with the aroma of pipe tobacco , though the master had long since stopped smoking ; beef and potatoes and carrots and red wine in the pot on the stove ; the barest remnant of the master 's wife 's perfume , even though she 'd gone out the door ; the salt air that was ever-present ; loam on the master 's slippers from the garden ; the varied and precious scents of Shadow 's world - were displaced by something else . He drew in the air in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hold no more , repeating the process again and again , focusing , letting his agile mind filter out the familiar to pinpoint the new odor . Cold . Earth . Must . Decay . Chill . Death . Evil . Woof . One quick noise , as much to chase the horrid scent from his nostrils as to alert the master . But the smell would not leave . The growl grew low in his chest as he rolled onto his haunches , not yet standing , still sampling the air . Go away ! " What 's wrong , buddy ? " The master 's voice , so soothing with its deep rumble , barely reached his mind . In a smooth , graceful motion , he rose and trotted to the front window , his nose still foul with the air . Could n't the master smell it ? Probably not . The master and his wife missed so much of the world . His pupils widened as he approached the glass , beyond which lay the dark world , full of the rising scents of nighttime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was right out there . **25;1162;TOOLONG ! Begone ! This is my master 's home ! You may not enter ! If it heard him , or understood , it paid him no heed . But his friends in the other houses heard , and understood , taking up the cry . " What , Shadow ? " the master said , now at his side . Shadow looked up at him , then out the window again , growling an angry warning as it approached . " There 's nothing there , boy ! Stop that racket . " The master could n't see it ? Of course he could n't smell it , but could n't he see ? **43;1189;TOOLONG ! No ! You ca n't have him ! I will die before I let you near him ! Begone ! Evil ! Danger ! Shadow looked up , his teeth bared , as it came through the glass - how could that be ? - and leapt up at it , snarling and snapping , clawing at it and finding nothing . " Calm down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now held the tiniest inkling of fear . Be afraid , Master ! Run ! Shadow grabbed the cuff of his master 's pants and pulled . Run ! Please ! The master reached down to push him away . Noooooo ! Shadow made one last lunge , then turned to the foul horror that seemed to stab at his nostrils like the quills of a porcupine and let out a savage growl , leaping between it and the master . But it passed right through and into the master 's body , now curling and ripping inside him . The master crumpled to the floor . Shadow pushed at him with his firm nose . Fight it ! He pawed the master 's arm , then his face , carefully , so that only the soft hairs between the pads of his paw touched the skin . Do n't go ! But the awful evil would not be deterred . With a horrible , joyful cry , it tore something deep inside . Shadow heard the ripping sound and saw the light go from his master 's eyes . Noooooo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It floated up and off , leaving nothing but the limp husk on the floor . Sated , the evil left , though Shadow was only dimly aware of its leaving . The master 's spirit was gone . No more morning walks to talk to Shadow 's neighbors . No more of his rough hands behind Shadow 's ears , working fur and skin and flesh as joy danced in Shadow 's heart . No more easing his feet into the slippers to settle in for dinner with his wife . Shadow turned his nose to the heavens and howled at the master 's soul . Please do n't leave me ! Please do n't leave ! Please do n't ! Please ! ( Continues ... )
