<p> Morphing planes that change shape as they fly . Solar-powered aircraft that stay aloft for months . Insect-like robots flapping gossamer wings in the cold thin air of Mars . Elevators to Earth orbit . <p> Affordable family weekends in space hotels . Aerial warfare among squadrons of pilotless drones . Flying spycams no bigger than mosquitoes . Jumbo jets with a thousand passengers . Hypersonic flights from New York to London in under an hour . <p> The future of flight or merely flights of fancy ? <p> As the world commemorates the 100th anniversary of Wilbur and Orville Wright 's historic Dec. 17 , 1903 , first flight this week , the next century of aviation us about to begin . <p> " A hundred years from now , we will have a transportation infrastructure similar to the interstate highway system that will enable people to travel to the moon , Mars or somewhere else , " says Robert Cassanova , director of NASA 's Atlanta-based Institute for Advanced Concepts . <p> Even futurists , however , contemplate aviation 's second century with both eagerness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be certain . The interplay of technology , politics , economics and human foibles guarantees a future that no one can fully foresee . <p> Standing at Kitty Hawk on a chill December in 1903 , it would have been hard to imagine that within a hundred years the Wright stuff would have changed so much for so many . <p> Back then , 120 feet of powered , controlled flight was a giant leap for mankind . Who could have foreseen that in less than 70 years , men would fly to the moon  --  and that the world would grow bored with their achievements ? <p> Who could have foreseen skies so crowded that airplanes would need traffic cops  --  and that city-sized airports , sprawling rental car lots , security lines , lost luggage and in-flight movies would become a way of life ? <p> Who could have imagined that angry young men would one day use airplanes loaded with passengers to destroy buildings taller than the Wrights ' flight was long ? Or that on a busy holiday weekend , 5 million Americans would fly home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two bicycle builders who launched the age of flight ? <p> As aviation 's second century dawns , however , there are some hints of what lies ahead . The Wrights proved that man can fly . Recent advances in technology are proving that machines can do it on their own . <p> Remotely piloted aircraft with names such as Predator and Global Hawk  --  both capable of operating autonomously for hours at a time  --  have already played minor roles in the conflicts in Kosovo , Afghanistan and Iraq . <p> But experts say the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles are now poised to expand rapidly  --  taking up new tasks like firing missiles , dropping bombs and eventually , in a real-world version of " Star Wars , " waging aerial dogfights with each other and with piloted aircraft . <p> Robo-pilots may have a role in commercial aviation as well . Modern jetliners can already fly from point to point , and even land , without a human at the controls . No one is ready yet to turn the whole show over to autopilot , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the present airliner 's two-man cockpit will become a one-man cockpit , " says Laurence Newcome , an aviation analyst with Virginia-based Adroit Systems , Inc . " Eventually , that one pilot will be there just to preprogram the autopilot and smile at the boarding passengers . " <p> " Passengers could be routinely traveling in pilotless planes by 2030 , " says Newcome . " The big challenge is not the technology , but convincing the public to get on board . " <p> Taking humans out of the loop is also paving the way for innovative flying machines that can stay aloft indefinitely . <p> NASA 's experimental Helios aircraft made headlines when it crashed this year in Hawaii , but not before it had proved that it could fly for 14 hours  --  at an altitude of nearly 100,000 feet  --  powered only by sunlight . <p> Next-generation solar-powered planes are being designed to demonstrate that an unmanned craft can stay airborne for weeks at a time , serving as semi-permanent surveillance or communications platforms . <p> Swiss balloonist Bertrand Piccard , a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is designing a solar-powered plane that he hopes will enable him to circle the globe nonstop . Test flights are planned in 2006 . <p> For some visionaries , big is better . Europe 's Airbus Industrie is spending $12 billion to develop the world 's largest passenger plane . When the first of the jetliners go into service in 2006 , they will be able to carry up to 636 passengers  --  more than the population of Kitty Hawk in 1903  --  and fly more than 8,000 miles without refueling . <p> Tiny fliers <p> Other experts see a future for flying that is very , very small . The military is testing a palm-sized " micro air vehicle " that has a wingspan of only 13 inches and weighs 6 ounces . <p> So far the tiny Wasp flier has stayed aloft for an hour an a half  --  long enough to make short range reconnaissance flights with a miniature video camera . <p> As flying machines shrink , engineers are discovering that the birds and insects had it right all along . At the Georgia Tech Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that researchers say  --  at that scale  --  are more efficient than the propellers and fixed wings that flying machines have used for the past century . <p> Someday , they say , bird-sized robotic entomopters may flit down dark alleyways in cities to spy on terrorists , monitor the spread of toxic gases or even help explore the surface of Mars . <p> Despite the demise of the supersonic Concorde , primarily for economic reasons , aviation experts are certain future flight will be even faster . <p> One hint of that future is NASA 's hypersonic X-43 , a reusable space plane that many feel will make access to space more affordable than today 's shuttle , which costs $500 million per flight . <p> Over the next several years , the space agency plans to test prototypes of the X-43 that can fly more than 10,000 miles an hour on an air-breathing scramjet engine before igniting a rocket engine that will boost it into space . <p> Steve Cook , deputy director of the next generation launch technology program at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20 years to develop such a system . <p> " But by 2030 , I think we will see this kind of technology used for suborbital commercial flights of both freight and passengers . At the speeds we expect to achieve , FedEx could offer next-hour delivery to Australia . <p> " Once we have low-cost access to space , a lot will happen , " he says . " Getting up the hill into Earth orbit is half the cost of going anywhere . " From there , he says , manned missions to the moon and Mars will become more feasible . <p> In some quarters , however , NASA 's vision of the future is too limited , and its timetable too conservative . It was less than 70 years from the time the Wrights made their little hops across the dunes of the Outer Banks until Neil Armstrong hopped across the surface of the moon . <p> But in the three decades since the lunar landings , experts say aviation has languished in the technological doldrums . And since the loss of the space shuttle Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is grounded until NASA can figure out how to fly it safely . The United States no longer has the capability or the hardware to send men to the moon . <p> ' Recapture the spirit ' <p> It 's time , says Peter Diamandis , president of the St. Louis-based X-Prize Foundation , to replicate the barnstorming days of aviation and the technological innovation that blossomed in the decades following the Wrights ' first flight . <p> The dizzying pace of progress  --  good , bad and ugly  --  included : <p> * the first licensed woman aviator in the United States ( Harriet Quimby in 1911 ) ; <p> * the first plane to exceed 100 miles an hour ( France 's Louis Bechereau in 1912 ) ; <p> * the first air-to-air kill ( a German aviator shot down over France in 1914 ) ; <p> * the first in-flight meal ( St. Petersburg to Kiev in 1914 ) ; <p> * the first trans-Atlantic flight ( Rockaway , N.Y . to Lisbon in 1919 ) ; and <p> * the first around-the-world flight ( 175 days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of that time and create a golden age of space travel that will match that golden age of aviation , " says Diamandis . <p> For starters , the nonprofit foundation is offering a $10 million prize , funded by foundations , corporations and private individuals , to the first privately financed team to build a reusable spaceship that can carry three people on a suborbital flight twice within a 14-day period  --  and do it by Jan. 1 , 2005 . Twenty teams from seven countries are vying for the prize . <p> The competition harks back to the first three decades of aviation , when more 100 aviation prizes were offered for milestones in flight . Diamandis believes that fierce competition will stimulate innovations in flight that have been stifled by government domination of space travel . <p> Among the leading competitors is 60-year-old Burt Rutan , the aviation pioneer who built Voyager , which in 1986 became the first airplane to fly around the world without refueling . <p> Rutan 's SpaceShipOne , a rocket-propelled craft launched from a jet-powered mother ship , is undergoing flight tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our program will mark the beginning of a renaissance for manned space flight , " Rutan says . " This might be similar to that wonderful period between 1908 and 1912 when the world went from a total of 10 airplane pilots to hundreds of airplane types and thousands of pilots in 39 countries . " <p> Diamandis , who has founded several small aerospace companies , says if private entrepreneurs can open up space , change will come as swiftly as it did in aviation 's first century . <p> The bottom line <p> Space tourism today is the province of the very rich . Two people , California millionaire Denis Tito and South African millionaire Mark Shuttleworth , paid $20 million for a ride in a Russian Soyuz capsule and a few days at the International Space Station . <p> " But if we can tap the energy of private enterprise , I think we will see private hotels in space between 2010 and 2012 at a fraction of the cost of the International Space Station " he says . " By 2015 , I think we will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I think by 2020 , we will see the first baby born in space . " <p> Widespread public access to space may be a compelling idea , but not necessarily a viable one . A variety of entrepreneurs over the last century touted " car-planes " that would put a flying machine in everyone 's garage . <p> Henry Ford actually planned to produce a flying automobile in 1940 , but his plans were derailed by World War II . <p> NASA still has a small program studying personal aircraft concepts . But in a world where highway congestion grows worse by the day , no one has yet devised a way to deal with gridlock caused by millions of airborne commuters . <p> Public access to space , however , may come in forms other than that of George Jetson 's cartoon family spacemobile . Cassanova , of NASA 's Institute for Advanced Concepts , says one of the most promising innovations is the space elevator , a notion first floated by science fiction writers in the 1970s . <p> Conceptually , a space elevator consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth 's surface and the other to a platform in geostationary orbit . Commercial payloads would be mechanically pulled up the cable and catapulted into orbit at a fraction of the present cost . <p> Spacecraft released at the cable 's far end would have sufficient energy to escape from Earth 's gravity tug and travel to more distant targets . <p> Pie in the sky ? Cassanova says with improvements in today 's carbon fiber technology , it might be possible to have a functioning space elevator within a few decades . <p> " Of course , when we look into the future , we tend to assume a perfect world , technologically , politically and economically , " he says . <p> " It might take longer . But back in 1903 , no one imagined how swiftly aviation would develop . When we consider the genius of the Wright Brothers , we should remember that genius is in the generalities , not in the details . The details get worked out later . "
