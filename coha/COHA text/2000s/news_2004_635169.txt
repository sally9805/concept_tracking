<p> NEW YORK  --  What becomes a legend most ? In the case of Peter O'Toole , it comes down to outlasting the younger generation . <p> Just ask his " Troy " co-star Brad Pitt . " I ca n't even begin to describe what a lovely , hilarious man Peter is , " Pitt says . " I went to meet with him for the first time in the afternoon . The idea was that we 'd hang out and bond . At 4 in the morning , I had to leave . I was just too tired , but he just keeps on going . " <p> Though he is 72 years old now , the bounce in O'Toole 's step is obvious when he saunters into a suite at the Essex House Hotel on a sunny spring afternoon . Most young actors arrive at these kind of events and slump into a chair . <p> O'Toole jets out a hand , and after a firm shake , gets right to the point . " What can I do for you ? " he asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It sounds like a command . <p> He 's still a handsome man with snow white hair offset by a crisp blue suit and matching tie . His smile is friendly , but all you can think when he opens his mouth is " Lawrence of Arabia , " " Lord Jim , " " Casino Royale , " " The Lion in Winter " or " Murphy 's War . " <p> O'Toole has come a long way from his epic 1962 film with David Lean to the $200 million " Troy , " directed by Wolfgang Petersen . In the latest epic , he plays King Priam , a man of honor who must watch his beloved sons Paris ( Orlando Bloom ) and Hector ( Eric Bana ) go into battle against the greatest warrior in the land named Achilles ( Brad Pitt ) . <p> Master of his domain <p> From the start , O'Toole had no doubt he could rule the land . <p> " When I began in the business all those years ago , I heard a saying . Basically , the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is if they can wear a crown . Just think about it for a minute . " <p> Vin Diesel  --  no . <p> Nicole Kidman  --  yes . <p> O'Toole does n't mind thinking about how this new epic compares to the legendary " Lawrence of Arabia . " Mention his year in the desert with Lean and he leans in to correct you . <p> " Two years , my dear , " he interjects . " Let 's not forget a moment of it . " <p> As is fitting with his legendary status , O'Toole has the type of stories that could fill a book . <p> " What has changed utterly over the years is the way you make these epics , " O'Toole begins . " Sir Herbert Reed said in the ' 20s and ' 30s , ' When cinema solves its technical problems , it will return to the hands of the poets . ' I 'm happy to report that we have solved our technical problems . " <p> O'Toole recalls that on " Lawrence , " he traveled the desert " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were crucified by equipment . " <p> His favorite story about the movie revolves around a train scene . " I remember we had to get a train from Germany all the way across Europe and to Spain . We had to attach the train to a pickup truck and pull the damn thing over the roads . We broke every road and bridge on our way because this was a huge 1914 locomotive . <p> " We finally got this thing down to Spain , and the first day we had it there , we blew it up , " he says , adding with a mischievous twinkle , " What fun is that ? David Lean was bored . I was bored . How many times can you get excited about blowing up a train ? But now you can do it on a computer with no loss of effect . Perhaps you even gain effect . <p> " Now , let 's hope we return the movies to the hands of the poets , " he says . <p> Now nearing the end of his career , O'Toole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if this wish will come true . He does n't begrudge young actors their shot and insists that 's why he 's back in the game . <p> " The joy for me is working with young people . How much joy I receive is incalculable . For me , right now , it 's my biggest turn-on . I grab energy from them . I grab their freshness and learn what 's going on in the world . <p> " When I meet someone like Eric or Brad  --  two serious and good actors  --  who are modest men and proper men , we get on like a house on fire . Brad , Eric and I watched Oscar de la Hoya get robbed of a bout . But enough of the socializing . Working with them was just a joy . They spark me , and I spark them . " <p> Pitt has one of the most moving scenes in the movie with O'Toole when the two have a midnight meeting in a tent over a moral quandary of epic proportions . Pitt reports that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my career . But I do n't think the word highlight does justice . It 's on my greatest hits reel of experiences . " <p> " That scene is the climax of The Iliad , " O'Toole says . " The scene we do is pure Homer  --  word for word . It was a daunting scene , even for an old hand like me . It 's full of layers and complexities . <p> " My flesh kills his flesh and his flesh kills my flesh . It 's a great philosophical debate amid a tragic pillage that is this war . Yet Brad and I are trying to offer the possibility of human goodness as they sit in a tent in the middle of the night . <p> " That is an acting experience , " O'Toole says with a smile . <p> The native of Ireland always planned on becoming a leading man . He was raised in Leeds , England , where his father worked as a bookie . After briefly mulling over a career in journalism , O'Toole gave up his work as a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a stint as a radioman in the Royal Navy , he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts where he shared the stage with the likes of Albert Finney , Alan Bates and Richard Harris . <p> A breakthrough role <p> After years onstage at the Old Vic , he turned to the movies . In 1962 , he made history when David Lean cast him in " Lawrence of Arabia . " International stardom was at his feet , but he eluded the Oscar , despite seven eventual nominations . O'Toole also struggled with a drinking problem , but beat his demons to return to film in " My Favorite Year " ( 1982 ) . <p> It is n't hard for him to find roles these days . It 's just that he carefully looks at his castmates . " Brad for me is a throwback . He 's an old-fashioned guy . I 've met Brads all my life and love to work with them . " <p> Is the new generation of actors up to par ? O'Toole says , " There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't blame them because so much of theater today is awful . England is a graveyard when it comes to theater now . " <p> In fact , O'Toole took his final curtain call in 2000 at the Old Vic . " I should n't say that because I might get broke tomorrow , " he says . " You might find me with a prop on my back and in a touring company ! But unless I have to do theater , I wo n't do it . " <p> His last play at the Old Vic was called " Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell . " <p> " It was my favorite modern play at my favorite theater and my alma mater . I remember taking the curtain call on the first night . You never know . But the entire theater stood on its feet , and I remember thinking , ' Peter , out . Bye , bye . ' <p> " It 's an exhausting business . I believe you can leave at the moment when you realize it ca n't get any better than that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There I was at 70 , in my favorite theater in my favorite play with a lovely cast and a standing ovation . I was a happy man . " <p> O'Toole finally has figured out his theory of acting . <p> " You can not dig a trench between the imagination and one 's own experience , " he says . " That said , the job of an actor is that our emotions are prompted by our imaginations . They 're real , deep and keenly felt . I do n't think acting is prompted by experience , but by emotion . " <p> As for what he gets from the acting experience now , he says , " I get from it the same thing I did when I was 20 . It 's what any artist feels . Do n't forget that one works and suffers . I think of it as if I 'm a sculptor who works for months or years creating a piece of art . Then someone pulls a sheet away . The artist must move on . Gone . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For the man who has never won an Oscar  --  he received an honorary one in 2003  --  the idea of one excites him . Already there is some talk that his " Troy " role could be remembered next year . <p> " Would n't that be nice , " he says , lightly . In another breath , he adds , " But this picture has barely been released . Give it a chance . " <p> He wo n't give retirement a chance . <p> " I have to earn my living , " he says . " The more I live , the more I have to work to earn it . " <p> Distributed by Big Picture News
