Mustang Madeleine SHE 'S BRED THE BEST . She 's raced the best . Now Madeleine Pickens is becoming the voice for the animals that have played such a major part in her life : horses . Photograph : Madeleine Pickens at Mesa Vista , her Texas ranch , with three of her horses . Over the past five years , wild mustangs roaming free on federal land in Nevada and other Western states have become a financial burden for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management . Ranchers complain that the mustangs , protected by an act of Congress in 1971 , compete with cattle for grazing space ; every year the BLM rounds up and cares for thousands of them until they are adopted , which could cost the government more than $30 million this year alone . The agency 's proposed solution  --  to euthanize thousands of horses  --  was something that Pickens , wife of the Texas billionaire T. Boone Pickens and a passionate animal lover , could n't fathom . " Here we have the sexiest heritage  --  the Old West , cowboys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are a national treasure . How do we just abandon them ? " So Pickens decided to put forth a solution of her own : a million-plus-acre sanctuary in the West , comprising both the current federal land and additional adjacent parcels to be bought , which would hold the more than 30,000 mustangs in captivity . Not only would the horses be safeguarded , but the land could also serve as an eco-friendly park for visitors from around the world . The tireless Pickens  --  who with her late first husband , Gulfstream founder Allen Paulson , owned and bred Thoroughbred champions , most notably Cigar  --  is now working with the BLM and has testified before Congress in an attempt to acquire the necessary land . ( In March the bureau said her plan was not viable as proposed ; Pickens is revising it . ) She hopes to establish a nonprofit foundation to manage the sanctuary , which she estimates could save taxpayers up to $700 million by 2020 . Pickens became aware of the mustangs ' plight soon after receiving an award for her animal-rescue work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donated $7 million to the relief efforts ; Madeleine chartered several commercial jets to Baton Rouge and , with the help of volunteers , saved almost 800 cats and dogs . Every animal was vaccinated , and nearly all were eventually adopted . " Someone approached me and asked if I knew what was happening to our wild mustangs , " Pickens says . " I was shocked . I could n't sleep at night . I knew I had to do something . " To learn more about how you can help , visit madeleinepickens.com . JACKIE BOLIN OPEN-ROAR POLICY Like the heroine she played in Alfred Hitchcock 's 1963 film The Birds , Tippi Hedren is ever so chic , even in a safari jacket and jeans , as she tours her Shambala Preserve , which she founded twenty-six years ago in the foothills forty miles northeast of Los Angeles . Shambala takes in abandoned or abused lions , tigers , leopards and panthers  --  there are sixty-five felines in all  --  from across America so that they can live out their days with love and dignity . Photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge in one of Shambala 's enclosed habitats . You can help by adopting a cat ( from $50 a month ) ; " wild parents " are able to visit their " children " the first Saturday of every month . Funds are also needed for maintenance of the seventy-acre site , which includes land bestowed by Hedren 's daughter , actress Melanie Griffith . For a $3,000 donation , a guest can stay overnight in a safari tent pitched near the lions , which provide wake-up calls . " They roar , they chuff  --  that 's how they talk to each other , " Hedren says . " And the females are just as loud as the males . " Safaris $40 per person , by reservation only . 661-268-0380 ; shambala.org . LAURIE DRAKE Let 's Drink to Dogs A portfolio of wines with adorable canine portraits on the labels has the potential to be cloying , annoying or worse . But Cru Vin Dogs has two things going for it : the wines are actually good , and at least 10 percent of the proceeds go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Morris Animal Foundation 's Canine Cancer Campaign . The brainchild of wine-industry veterans Bill Foss and Mary Snellgrove , the Denver-based group now offers seven limited-production bottlings , featuring detailed renderings of dogs by Snellgrove 's husband , artist Jay Snellgrove . Sonoma winemaker Tony Wasowicz procures grapes from top vineyards in California and elsewhere . My favorites are the plucky Labrador Retriever Sauvignon Blanc Puppy Series 2006 ( $15 ) , a lean , lime-accented white from New Zealand 's Marlborough region , and the Yogi Cabernet-Syrah Portrait Series 2005 ( $26 ) , a smooth , silky Sonoma red with a hint of chocolate on the nose . Its bark and its bite are equally beguiling . 866-278-8461 ; cruvindogs.com . TED LOOS
