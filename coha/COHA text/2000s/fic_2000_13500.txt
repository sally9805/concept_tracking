The stage is in darkness . Gradually the light increases to illuminate most of the stage . The area lower R containing the writing desk is largely left in shadow , so that Nannerl 's presence , seated there , is hardly noticed . MOZART ( calls from off stage ) : ANNERL ! ANNER - LE ! ( Rushes onstage , clearly excited ) ANNERLE ! Where are you ? MOZART ( enters from the opposite direction ) Over here ! MOZART ( pulls up two chairs ) : Here ! Here , sit down ! MOZART ( puzzled , seats herself ) : What is it ? ( Worried ) Has something happened ? MOZART ( Paces highly animated ) : Oh no no no ! But something will happen ! Is about to happen ! MOZART ( pats the chair beside her ) : Come then ! Calm yourself ! Sit down and tell me about it . MOZART ( continues pacing ) : Such an idea came to me today ! MOZART Oh ? p. 3 MOZART You know the success I had teaching Nannerl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of musical instruction . MOZART Exactly ! And now little Wolfgang is showing the same talent ! MOZART Oh yes ! And getting all that extra help from Nannerl ! You should hear her play music teacher ! Sounds exactly like when you were teaching her ! MOZART Must be quite a taskmaster then ! MOZART Oh yes ! ( Pause ) But sometimes I worry ... MOZART You worry ? Why in heaven 's name ? MOZART That they work a little too hard at the music ... MOZART Nonsense ! Music is their greatest joy ! MOZART If you think so ... MOZART Of course ! And that brings me back to the great idea I had today ! MOZART Oh yes ? MOZART Those talents deserve a wider audience ! MOZART I do n't understand .... They already have a wide audience . Our circle : Your colleagues , our friends , the Hagenauers ... p. 4 MOZART ( laughs ) : Oh ! Such a small circle ! They deserve one much wider than that ! MOZART Oh ? I still do n't understand ... MOZART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ! To the highest nobility ! To royalty ! MOZART That will not be easy . MOZART Of course not ! But I have it all planned out ! We will begin with Munich . I have connections there . That will be the first . Not too far away . A kind of test to begin with . MOZART Good and well ! But how will you arrange it ? MOZART Details ! Details ! I have n't worked those out yet . But I will , I will ! Believe me I will ! LEOPOLD AND MRS.MOZART EXIT . NANNERL slowly rises from her position beside the writing desk , closing the book resting there . For a moment rests her hand on the cover . Then moves to center stage onto a slightly higher level . MOZART And so we go to MunichIt is wintertime.It is bitterly cold.The coach ride is long and slippery . Sometimes we sleep , Wolferl 's head resting on my lap.I miss Mama . Papa does not sleep at all . He is too excited . All the time he talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen : Yes Papa , of course Papa , surely Papa . Even when I do not understand what he is talking about . Finally we arrive in Munich . p. 5 MOZART See , Nannerl . Those are the palace gardens at Nymphenburg . Make careful notes . Remember the diary I gave you on your birthday ? Note everything down , every little detail . MOZART Oh , look Papa ! MOZART What is so amusing ? Why are you laughing so ? MOZART Those statues , Papa ! MOZART So ? You have seen statues before . MOZART They got big furry hats of snow ! And nothing else on ! Imagine : bare naked ! But great big hats on their heads ! MOZART As your Mama always says : it is important to keep your head warm in cold weather . MOZART Oh silly Papa ! Snow hats to keep your head warm ! And look ! A glass house full of trees . In the middle of winter ! MOZART An orangerie . Those are orange trees . MOZART With lanterns hanging in them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask them to pick one for you . Now , take care : your brother is off again . Hiding behind the statues . MOZART Wolferl ! Wolferl : Come out ! Come at once ! Papa will be very angry ! p. 6 MOZART Quickly ! There is a concert to be played ! MOZART Come ! Come quickly ! We must not let Papa down ! ( Moves onto a higher level . ) We do not let Papa down , Wolfgang and I.Wolfgang has to be coaxed to play in front of all those strangers.Refuses to perform on his own . Always I take his hand ( Stretches out her hand ) Come , little brother , here is my hand . ( Mimes drawing her little brother to her ) Take my hand , little brother . Take my hand , and do n't be afraid ! The lighting grows dimmer , to near-darkness , but a sharp spotlight remains focused on Nannerl 's outstretched hand . NANNERL descends to resume her position at the writing desk . MOZART ( offstage ) : Anna ! Annerle ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ! We are home again ! MOZART ( hurries on-stage ) Leopold ! Poldi ! ( Laughingly takes his hand ) But where are the children ? My little travelers returned from afar ! MOZART Outside . Being welcomed by Bimperl . Everybody dancing around . Like whirlwinds they are ! MOZART So tell me ! Tell me all about it ! p. 7 MOZART Oh , a great success it was ! Royalty treated us as if we ourselves are Royalty ! Such praise ! Such admiration ! Such astonishment ! MOZART Oh tell me ! I want to hear everything ! Every little thing ! MOZART Oh , I will , I will ! But first to Mr.Hagenauer ! He must share in the excitement ! MOZART And the finances ? MOZART Excellent . Excellent ! Far beyond expectation ! MOZART Oh , good ! I was worried about that ... MOZART No need , no need ! And now we must prepare for our next big trip ! MOZART Another trip ? A bigger trip ? MOZART To Vienna this time ! To perform for the Empress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come ! Call the children inside ! There is no time to lose ! From now on no more silly games with Bimperl ! Should never have got that fox terrier bitch ! From now on it 's practice , practice , practice ! MOZART Poldl ! Leopold ! Slow down ! Please slow down ! MOZART Slow down ? p. 8 MOZART They are children yet ! Tired after their journey ! MOZART ( enters ) : Oh , not tired at all , Mama ! It was wonderful , wonderful ! There was a glass house full of trees with oranges . In the middle of winter ! Shining lanterns ! They picked one for me , opened it up . Like a water lily ! The smell ! The taste ! Little spurts of cold sweet juice into my mouth ! MOZART Come here , my child ! I am so happy to have you home again ! MOZART Oh Mama , it was wonderful , wonderful ! And Papa made me laugh . MOZART Papa made you laugh ? MOZART There were bare-naked statues ! And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to keep their heads warm ! MOZART Or to cool their heads down ! Your Papa is too hotheaded , ready to go off again ! MOZART Another tour ! Oh Papa ! How wonderful ! MOZART You too Nannerl ! I think we need one more hat of snow ! MOZART Annerle , I assure you ! There is no time for silly jokes ! There is no time to lose ! MOZART You are still in the employ of the archbishop ! Will he grant permission for another journey ? An even longer journey ? p. 9 MOZART Oh , I will seek an audience with His Holiness at the earliest opportunity ! And take the children to demonstrate a Salzburg miracle ! There is no way he will refuse this permission ! The lights dim . LEOPOLD and MRS.MOZART exit . Some people cross the front of the stage from different directions , greet each other , and stop to converse . Some random comments are made:They have returned . Covered in glory , I hear.Created a sensation in Munich ; Ha ha ! Quite an achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House ! Precious stones , it is said . Gold and silver . Their coffers swollen with riches.Also the head of our Kapellmeister : swollen to bursting ! ( The people move away , apparently still in conversation . ) LEOPOLD returns slowly , with respectfully measured pace . The ARCHBISHOP enters regally , attired in brilliant red robes . Slowly he mounts the highest level , and faces LEOPOLD . ARCHBISHOP You may approach ! MOZART Your Grace ! ARCHBISHOP I have listened to the children make their music . Charming ! Absolutely charming they were ! MOZART I thank Your Grace . p. 10 ARCHBISHOP The little girl : so enchanting , such a charming appearance ! And the little boy : A quaint little man already ! MOZART So true , Your Worship ! ARCHBISHOP There was a point in requesting this audience ? In arranging for the children to perform in my presence ? MOZART Yes , my honored archbishop . Indeed there is a purpose . ARCHBISHOP Which is ? MOZART I wish to ask your gracious permission to take the children on another tour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MOZART To Vienna , Your Grace . ARCHBISHOP To Vienna ? MOZART Yes , Your Holiness . I hope that the children will delight the Empress Maria Theresa with their artistry . I believe their reputation has preceded them . ARCHBISHOP Yes , so I believe . I have heard their praises sung in reports by others well outside Salzburg . MOZART Their fame , Your Grace , is the fame of Salzburg . Whatever they achieve in terms of fame and glory , that brings fame and glory to Salzburg ! And thus to you , Your Holy Grace ! p. 11 ARCHBISHOP Ah yes ! Indeed , indeed ! MOZART Thus may I presume that the permission of Your Holiness has been graciously and generously granted ? ARCHBISHOP Yes , yes . You may . MOZART I most deeply and most humbly express my gratitude to Your Grace ! Also that of my gifted children ! ARCHBISHOP One request , my dear Herr Mozart . MOZART Of course , Your Worship ! ARCHBISHOP On your way to Vienna , I would like you to stop over in Passau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archbishop there . I would like him to hear the children play . I would be pleased to demonstrate how God has graced Salzburg with such a miracle ! MOZART Of course , Your Grace ! And my most humble thanks ! ARCHBISHOP And perhaps on their return , the children will play for me those pieces they have played for the Empress ! MOZART But most assuredly , Your Grace ! ARCHBISHOP I leave you then . To your preparations ! ( Playfully raises his hand in the gesture of a toast ) To your success ! And may your journey be crowned with glory ! Which is also to the glory of the court of Salzburg ! The ARCHBISHOP exits slowly , smiling . LEOPOLD remains standing for some moments . Then exits confidently , clearly pleased with his achievement . p. 12 MOZART ( moves to center stage . The spotlight falls on her ) : And so our journey begins.It is summer , almost autumn.The hills around us glow golden green.The weather gets worse.And worse.For days there is no sun to be seen . MOZART Passau ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not see a thing ! MOZART Let us get down . This is the Red Crab Inn . MOZART Fit for crabs and other water things ! Not for us ! Oh no ! The hem of my dress all wet ! And my new shoes covered with mud ! Careful Wolferl : watch your step ! Do n't step on the little fishes ! MOZART Do n't agitate so ! I will carry him down . MOZART Papa delivers his letter to the court.We wait for a reply.None comes for days.The rain continues.We wait in the wet gloom . And wait . MOZART Please Papa ! Please ! Let us move on ! MOZART No . We have to wait . I made a promise to my Archbishop . A promise I must keep . MOZART We continue to wait . And wait . And wait . p. 13 MOZART Ah ! Finally ! The summons has come ! MOZART At last ! When do we go ? MOZART Oh dear ! Women are not permitted at the abbey . Only Wolfgang and I are invited . MOZART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But of the female sex . MOZART Wolfgang will not play alone : Always he wants to hold my hand ! He will refuse to play ! MOZART You will calm him down . We must obey the Archbishop ! MOZART You will leave me alone ? Alone , here at the Inn ? MOZART It can not be helped ! MOZART Papa ! I am frightened ! Listen to the men downstairs ! They are so loud ! There is arguing ! And shouting ! MOZART You will stay quietly upstairs . MOZART Papa ! Do n't leave me ! Do n't leave me ! Listen ! Wolfgang will not go without me ! Refuses to perform alone . Always she holds my hand , he cries . Over and over ! She always holds my hand ! In the end Wolfgang and Papa leave without me.So I sit for hours.Alone.Frightened . Papa has left me . Left me all alone ! Moving across the stage at the front drunken , singing revelers nudge and jostle each other : laughing , pushing , and shoving . Finally , after what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they move off stage.I cry till there are no more tears left.Outside the rain goes on.And on.And on.The heavens are weeping . I think . For several moments the stage remains dimly lit . As the light brightens , LEOPOLD comes storming on-stage. p. 14 MOZART I have never been so insulted in my life ! First made to wait for days in miserable weather ! Then made to wait in the abbey like people of trade ! The final insult : one single lousy piece of gold . Wrapped in paper ! Given to the boy ! A mere trinket ! A pat on the head ! And dismissal ! MOZART Oh Papa ! I was so frightened ! I was so afraid ! There was so much noise ! The men were singing so loudly ! Oh Papa , I cried so much ! MOZART Come then Nannerle , hush , hush ! We will waken Wolfgang . He is fast asleep . MOZART I want to go home ! I want to be home with Mama ! MOZART Calm down , my child . Everything will get better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace . Remember how you loved Nymphenburg ? MOZART Oh yes ! They were kind . MOZART The Empress will treat us kindly . The gardens , I am told , are very beautiful . The best roses in all of Austria , they say ! MOZART Better than Mirabell gardens ? MOZART So I am told . MOZART And the sun will be shining ? MOZART I promise ! p. 15 MOZART Papa ! One should not make promises one can not keep ! MOZART To bed , to bed ! ( Takes his daughter 's arm and leads her away ) With arms linked , a couple of revelers cross the stage , staggering , singing drunkenly . MOZART High time for another letter to Hagenauer ! Dearest friend and patron deserves to learn of our successes . Two performances in Schoenbrunn palace ! Unfortunately Wolfgang came down with scarlet fever . Now Wolfgang is over the fever , we can accept the invitations to perform in Pressburg ! A sound of horses and coach wheels on cobblestones , precedes an actor who comes on stage : " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixteen . MRS.MOZART comes on-stage , walking slowly and hesitantly . She consults a piece of paper , looking up , and down again . MOZART Yes ... yes ... this is the address : Number sixteen . ( Stands quietly , hesitant ) MOZART ( enters ) ANNERLE ! What on earth are you doing here ? MOZART Leopold ! Do n't be angry with me ! MOZART What happened ? Why are you here ? MOZART I had to come ! When I read of Wolfgang 's illness .... and further delays . I could not bear to stay at home ! p. 16 MOZART But how ? How did you get here ? MOZART By hired coach . With money borrowed from the Hagenauers . MOZART This greatly adds to our expenses ! MOZART I do not care ! The children 's ' welfare comes first ! That 's what I care about ! MOZART Of course , of course . MOZART And let me tell you one more thing ! There will be no more trips without me ! Every trip , no matter where , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be there for my children , no matter what the expense ! MOZART Yes , yes , of course . You are right . There is much traveling ahead ! Your presence will greatly ease things for the children . MOZART ( alarmed ) : More traveling ? MOZART Tomorrow we set off for Pressburg . MOZART I was expecting to come home ! All of us together ! MOZART Come , come , Annerle ! Pressburg is very close to Vienna ! The Count is providing a comfortable carriage , and we will be accommodated in the palace . Great earnings are promised from this tour ! p. 17 MOZART ( unimpressed ) : And when will be returning home ! MOZART Soon , soon , my dear little Annerle ! Very soon ! MOZART I wish I could believe you ! I 'm sure you have already extended your leave of absence from the court ! MOZART Not to worry , not to worry . Our Count von Schrattenbach is a most generous and understanding employer ! Now ! Put on a cheerful face to greet the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses and carriages moving.NANNERL and MRS.MOZART enter together . MOZART So good to be home again ! MOZART Yes , Mama . MOZART What is the matter , my Nannerle ! MOZART Why do you ask , Mama ? MOZART You seem different . MOZART Different ? How different , Mama ? MOZART After the Munich tour you were in such high spirits ... MOZART Yes . At Nymphenburg they were very kind . p. 18 MOZART They were very kind to us in Pressburg . Even to me although I am no musician and no entertainer ! MOZART Pressburg was all right . MOZART Come . Sit down Nannerle . Tell me what is troubling you ! MOZART It is difficult ... difficult to explain ... MOZART Come now . Your Mama is listening . MOZART I was very unhappy . MOZART I know about Passau . And yes , that was very bad . Leaving you alone in the inn . But after that : your Papa says that Vienna was a great success . The Empress had been most kind and most generous . MOZART ( gets up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionately ) : I did not , do not like the Empress , Mama ! MOZART Not like the Empress ? Your Papa said she was kind and generous . And those beautiful outfits she gave you and Wolfl ! MOZART I loved the dress you made me ! All soft and silky . And so much money spent on the trimmings , you told Papa ! MOZART No matter . There will be plenty of occasions to wear it ! p. 19 MOZART She asked to see the clothes we would be wearing . And she took my dress - the nicest one I ever had - and she threw it down ! Threw it on the ground ! Oh no she said , this will never do ! The children have to be properly dressed . And she ordered her lady to look among her children 's ' clothes for something they no longer wear . MOZART She meant well . MOZART And Papa never said a word , except , oh thank you your Royal Highness , I am much honored , and the children are deeply grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to cry . And I was very angry , with both the Empress and with Papa ! MOZART With Papa ! Surely not with Papa ! MOZART Oh yes ! Especially with Papa ! MOZART But why , my Nannerle ? Why with Papa ? MOZART You remember my little piece of music I made up ? In the book Papa gave me on my birthday when I turned nine years old ? MOZART Of course I do ! Your Papa was very proud of you ! MOZART He copied my little piece on fancy paper . And he gave it to the Empress as a gift ! MOZART You should feel very honored. p. 20 MOZART And told her Wolfgang had composed it ! When he was four years old ! MOZART ( taken aback ) : Oh ? MOZART The Empress went on and on and on : Oh how delightful , oh what a clever little boy , oh what a charming gesture . And she invited Wolfgang to eat beside her at the table ! MOZART Now that is indeed an honor to sit with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing next to her chair ! And she fed him tidbits . Like we are not allowed with Bimperl ! ( Loudly ) She fed him like a pet doggie ! MOZART And you ? And Papa ? MOZART Oh , we were put with the serving staff . I crept away to look out for Wolfl . MOZART You were not noticed ? MOZART Oh no . I stood at the side . In the shadows . I was not seen . I stood in the shadow where no one could see me cry . Neighbors , men and women , cross the stage : exclaiming excitedly:Look at that ! Their own carriage ! Absolutely magnificent.How could they afford it ? Oh , fortunes were made ! More gifts ! More honors given ! They will be too grand for Salzburg now ! I think the Herr Kapellmeister was always too grand for us ! In his own mind yes ! His head more swollen than ever ! Pompous , arrogant ! Not too well liked by his fellow musicians . p. 21 MOZART ( enters ) : Well ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the look of astonishment on Mr.Hagenauer 's face at the sight of our own coach ! MOZART So we will be able to repay the Hagenauers ! We will sell the carriage . There is no need for it here in Salzburg . MOZART In Salzburg , no . But we will need it for our next tour ! MOZART Our next tour ? MOZART Oh yes ! The Grand Tour ! MOZART What do you mean : the " Grand Tour " ? Has n't this one been grand enough ? MOZART The rest of Europe next ! The great courts ! The homes of the great nobility ! MOZART What will the archbishop say ? You already stayed away past the permitted time on the present trip ! Surely he will not grant permission again ! MOZART Already granted ! Yes , my dear wife ! As I so eloquently pointed out , the glory of our miraculous musicians is also to the glory of Salzburg ! And therefore reflected glory onto his court ! And ultimately onto His Holy Grace ! ( Appears to notice NANNERL for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side ) . Nannerle ! Why the long face ? p. 22 MOZART The child is tired . It has been a long journey . And the girl is feeling poorly . MOZART To rest then ! There is much work ahead ! MOZART We are going on another tour ? MOZART Yes , my dear girl . More pretty gifts and pretty trinkets for my pretty daughter ! Off to rest then ! NANNERL exits . MOZART ( angry , confronts her husband ) : When is this journey to begin ? We have only just returned . And the weather is bad ! January is no time to travel ! MOZART Of course not ! We will be leaving in June . The weather should be fine then . And ( pauses for dramatic effect ) we will be traveling in style ! MOZART Oh ? MOZART I have already engaged the services of young Sebastian Winter . Nineteen years old . He will be acting as our valet ! MOZART A valet ! MOZART He will be kept very busy . Looking after the horses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpacking . Looking after our clothes ... MOZART Nineteen years old ? Is that wise ? p. 23 MOZART Oh , I 've been assured that he is a most capable young man ! MOZART A young man . So close to the family ! And our pretty Nannerl on the verge of blossoming ! MOZART Calm yourself ! Always worrying about the silliest things ! When we stand at the beginning of a wonderful adventure ! Come then ! Mrs. Hagenauer is waiting to welcome you home ! She wants to hear all about it . And longing to look at our treasure trove of precious gifts LEOPOLD pulls MRS.MOZART by the hand , makes a happy rushed exit with his wife . Members of the Hagenauer family appear , rush forward . Mrs.Mozart is hugged , kissed , surrounded : tell us about it ! Tell us all about it ! Such wonders ! Such a miracle and another journey planned ! Off in that magnificent coach ! Come , come inside ! Tell us everything ! ! THE STAGE REMAINS EMPTY FOR SOME MOMENTS . GRADUALLY THE LIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , arms linked . ) MOZART At last ! Those European cities left behind ! Those palaces ! I 'm not made for behaving in stuffy salons ! Pretending to be the Grand Dame ! MOZART Indeed not ! You and Wolfgang ! MOZART But London ! So pretty in springtime ! All those daffodils ! p. 24 MOZART No regrets then ? MOZART Come , let us sit down ! Such comfortable benches they have in these London parks . And a lovely view of the flowers from here ! MOZART And you did not want to come ! MOZART We were so tired , the children and I. All those cities ! So many ! I do not even remember their names ! MOZART Never mind . I got Nannerl to keep a record . Ever since I gave her that diary when she turned nine , she has been a good girl . Writing everything down . Although her spelling leaves much to be desired ! MOZART I did so want to return home ! I like a feeling of having roots somewhere ! Growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . From the windows of the family home I could see the lake , watch it change with the seasons . Those walks , winter or summer ! Only yesterday I was telling Nannerl ! MOZART In London you have felt quite settled , have you not ? MOZART Oh yes ! MOZART Sometimes I feel we could stay here forever . Like some of the German musicians . Young Bach has become quite a friend . And Haendel has been a pillar of strength . p. 25 MOZART True . MOZART Here we have been treated with proper respect ! Our success in London has been truly phenomenal ! Here they know how to appreciate music ! Why , we had scarcely arrived , and already King George and Queen Charlotte invited us ! No shabby begging for an audience ! MOZART And the opportunities for public performances ! Those huge ticket sales ! MOZART One thing bothers me a little ... MOZART Yes ? MOZART The newspaper notices . The ones to inform the public of the performances .... MOZART Yes ? MOZART Wolfl does not age the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOZART The boy is of such small stature . People accept the younger age . MOZART But Poldl ! That is dishonest ! MOZART It sells the tickets . MOZART Still , it is an untruth ! The difference in the children 's ' ages is getting bigger every year ! MOZART Unfortunately it is difficult to modify the girl 's age . She is showing growing signs of young womanhood . It will soon be impossible to present her as a miracle child ! p. 26 MOZART It still bothers me ! Tinkering with the truth is not right ! Whatever the reason ! MOZART Sometimes you speak with the petty voice of a Provincial Salzburg housewife ! MOZART That is exactly what I am : a Salzburg housewife ! ( Strides off angrily ) . LEOPOLD , scowling , follows her offstage.A couple of people walk across the stage , and pause : Oh look ! A poster for another concert ! They are a true miracle ! Their performance is something to see ! You should see them , always together . She holds him by the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage they smile at each other as they play . And what playing ! I heard they play hand-over-hand as they sit together ! Oh yes , their hands flying like birds ! Fingers flashing to and fro ! Little magicians ! THE LIGHTING GRADUALLY DIMS.WHEN BRIGHTNESS RETURNS , MRS.MOZART comes tip toeing on-stage , finger held to her lips . MOZART ( to unseen listeners offstage ) : Hush ! Absolute quiet ! No sounds ! Yes , yes , I know it has been several weeks ! MOZART ( enters , walks slowly , appears extremely fatigued ) : So , Annerle , I believe my health is slowly returning . p. 27 MOZART I knew it would ! I prayed for this every day ! So did the ( BOTH seat themselves , facing each other . ) MOZART Ah , the children . I am so concerned they had to stop their work . MOZART Oh ! But they did n't ! They never stopped ! MOZART I do n't understand . I never heard a sound . MOZART Because they never made a sound ! MOZART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On sheets of paper they wrote their scores . Whispering . Consulting each other . Little collaborators ! Sometimes one wrote , sometimes the other ! Some pieces for four hands . And they would pretend to play . Fingers flying ! Hands crossing over ! Giggling . Saying at concerts people specially loved that hand crossing , hand over hand ! MOZART Amazing ! Let me see the compositions ! MOZART There ! A whole bunch of them ! MOZART How astounded the people will be ! That a boy of his tender years composed all this ! The skill ! The remarkable productivity ! MOZART Oh , not Wolfgang alone ! Nannerl too ! It was double work ! Work thought up together ! p. 28 MOZART Well , we do n't need to tell people that do we ? MOZART Why ever not ? It is still pretty remarkable ! And the girl deserves some recognition too ! Why push her into the shade ! Let her share in deserved praise ! MOZART Surely she gets enough of that ! She has been feted and acclaimed as few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , credit should be given where it is due ! MOZART Come , come . After all , she is growing ! Blossoming , you call it . She will soon appear to be of marriageable age . Wolfgang will continue to present as a miracle . Fortunately he is of very small stature . I believe there may be some years left for Wolfgang to draw the people to his performances . MOZART And not Nannerl ? She is highly praised for her artistry ! MOZART But no longer a miracle child ! Come , come ! Let us call the children . They will be happy to make music again . Maybe listen to their own compositions when they play them to give pleasure to their Papa ! To celebrate the beginning of his recovery ! BOTH EXIT . A CHANGE OCCURS IN THE LIGHTING : THE LIGHT IS REDUCED TO NEAR DARKNESS , WITH A SPOTLIGHT INTENSIFYING ONTO THE HIGHEST LEVEL . p. 29 ARCHBISHOP ( ascends ) : So ! The fame of my Kapellmeister has spread all over Europe . And England too , I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How long is it since they have left now ? About three years ? Almost three years ? Well ! It 's about time Salzburg heard some of this music too ! Right ? Perhaps you will compose a letter to that effect ? Very tactfully , of course . Reminding Herr Mozart that Count von Schrattenburg , Archbishop of Salzburg , is still his employer ! DESCENDS AND EXITS . MOZART Sadly we leave London . Papa wants to fit in as many performances as possible on our return journey . One concert after the other . One city after the other . Always in a rush , rush , rush ! Little Wolfgang is growing . Soon the miracle of a young prodigy will cease to amaze ! Finally we return to Salzburg . It is almost sixteen months since we left London . MOZART Oh how happy to be home again ! MOZART And Bimperl ! No , Bimperl has not forgotten us ! Bimperl and I , we do a little dance ! Like we used to do before we went away ! MOZART Not so fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home again ! p. 30 MOZART We have been summoned to go on another trip . MOZART Another trip ? MOZART To Vienna . The Archduchess Maria Josepha is to be married to the king of Naples . We are invited to perform at the festivities . MOZART It all goes horribly wrong ! People are running to and fro , bumping into each other , as they emerge on opposite sides of the stage , their behavior clearly panic stricken : CITIZEN no 1 : The news ! CITIZEN no 2 : Dreadful news ! CITIZEN no 3 : What ? What news ? CITIZEN no 4 : The bride is dead ! Only seventeen years old ! CITIZEN no 1 : Died of the pox ! All festivities are cancelled ! Excited mixed cries : the pox ! Oh no ! we must run ! Get away ! Off the streets ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Hide ! LEOPOLD and MRS.MOZART stroll across the stage . MOZART Vienna is like a city besieged ! MOZART I know , I know . But we came out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Their faces still show the marks . People avoid us on the street ! MOZART But what an achievement ! In spite of everything the Empress invited us to perform at the palace ! p. 31 MOZART And got more than she bargained for ! MOZART What do you mean ? MOZART Did n't you notice ? Young Joseph , emperor-to-be , paying excessive homage to our Nannerl all evening ? MOZART She did play beautifully . MOZART Oh-ho ! It was n't only her playing that enchanted him ! Why , I saw her blushing several times ! MOZART No harm done . Our Nannerl is quite used to admiration ! MOZART No harm done ! The Empress might not agree ! She looked quite annoyed ! And young Joseph paid no attention to his dear Mama ! MOZART The Empress knows nothing can come of such an attraction . MOZART Just as well ! Can you imagine me as Mama-in-law to an emperor ! Straining to be on my best behavior ! MOZART Impossible ! Your jokes are positively lewd at times ! Not fit for any grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy those jokes ! What fun we had ! MOZART I still do ! In the bedchamber ! Not in polite company ! AS LEOPOLD AND MRS.MOZART EXIT , apparently in continuing conversation , NANNERL steps forward , facing the audience . p. 32 MOZART Strangely , for no reason I could understand , we fall into disfavor with the Empress . There are no further invitations to the palace . No further gifts . No further expressions of praise . Mama is beside herself with happiness when we return to Salzburg . We have been on the road , more or less , for almost seven years . MOZART ( enters , holds his hand out to Nannerl ) : Come , my little Nannerle ! Come stand by your father to hear the verdict of the archbishop . NANNERL takes her father 's hand . Both assume a waiting posture . ARCHBISHOP ( enters in a somewhat less formal manner , and seats himself ) You may approach , my dear Kapellmeister ! And the charming Fraulein Mozart ! Quite the prettiest young lady now , I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spent the most entertaining time with your son . His wit is as entertaining as his music ! You must be waiting to hear my decision . MOZART Yes , Your Grace . ARCHBISHOP Your son tells me he wishes to further his musical education in Italy . MOZART Yes , Your Grace . p. 33 ARCHBISHOP I tested him on his Italian . I was impressed . You must have been teaching him . MOZART Yes , Your Grace . ARCHBISHOP I grant you permission to accompany your son to Italy . He is clearly too young to travel on his own . I grant your request for further leave . And wish you well . God be with you , my dear friend ! ( Exits ) . MOZART ( faces Nannerl ) : Well , my good daughter , you know what this means ! MOZART Papa ? MOZART You and Mama will have to stay behind . MOZART Stay behind ? Stay behind ? MOZART There will be many extra expenses . MOZART I am to be left behind ? MOZART Your help will be needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The stage darkens , filled with flickering light.Background noises are heard : drunken voices , drunken laughter , arguing . " Oh what a pretty young maid ! " Ho , ho , ho , all alone ! Left all alone upstairs ! MOZART Papa ! I was so afraid ! The rain went on , and on , and on ! The sky was weeping ! And I cried , and cried , and cried ! Till there were no tears left ! p. 34 MOZART Silly girl ! You will stay here with your Mama . Your services as teacher of music are requested almost daily . By the richest and noblest families in the city . I will ensure that you command the highest fees ! Your income will help to pay for your brother 's studies . MOZART I want to come ! I love playing ! I love the concerts ! The applause ! I do not wish to be left behind ! MOZART This will be no concert tour . Your brother will go to Italy for further study . And now I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Dashes offstage ) MOZART ( steps down to the lowest level ) : And so I stay behind.And teach music to the daughters of the rich and noble . To help pay for my brother 's Italian tour . THE LIGHTS FADE TO COMPLETE DARKNESS . Young people rush onto the front of the stage , laughing , pulling each other , various shouts and calls reverberate : Come on , Nannerl ! Come on out ! Lovely snow ! Big fat snow ! Come on out , we got the sleigh all ready ! Come on , Joseph ! Come ride with Nannerl ! Barbara ! Theresa ! We got the blankets ! NANNERL is seated at the desk , where the light is concentrated , while the rest of the stage remains in darkness . p. 35 MOZART Nannerle ! Back already ? MOZART And none too soon ! MOZART You did n't enjoy the sleigh ride ? MOZART At first I did . Such fun to be with old friends again ! How grown up every one has become ! MOZART Well , so have you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself at first ? MOZART At first when I was with the Barisani girls . MOZART Ah ! Doctor Barisani 's daughters . Surely they were not unfriendly to you ? MOZART Of course not . Then there was Barbara von Moelk , my dear dear friend . MOZART So what went wrong ? MOZART Unfortunately , also her brother Joseph . He came along as well . MOZART Why unfortunately ? Joseph comes from one of the most respected families in Salzburg ! MOZART Respected ! Somehow that Joseph managed to squeeze himself in beside me . And you have no idea how disrespectfully his hands behaved underneath the blanket that covered us both ! MOZART ( pretends to be shocked , but secretly pleased ) : No ! p. 36 MOZART Oh yes ! In spite of the fact that I kept out of his way all afternoon ! MOZART You do n't like him at all ? MOZART Like him ! I find him utterly crude ! MOZART You have reached an age when your thoughts might turn to marriage ... MOZART Well , most certainly not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attentions of another Joseph ? MOZART Another Joseph ? MOZART I 'm thinking of a certain Imperial Joseph . His attentions to you at Schoenbrunn Palace . The Empress Maria Theresa appeared quite put out . MOZART Oh Mama ! That is so ridiculous ! MOZART I worry a little . Maybe you were spoilt a little by all that grandeur and refinement . Those compliments . The rich gifts . Perhaps your expectations have become too high ! MOZART Set your mind at rest ! It 's simply that young Joseph does not appeal to me personally ! MOZART Sometimes I wonder if you have any interest in the opposite sex at all ! p. 37 MOZART Oh , but I do , Mama ! ( Teasing ) More than you may think ! MOZART You never told me ! MOZART I do n't think you would have wanted to hear ! MOZART I ca n't imagine when that could have been ... MOZART Promise you wo n't be shocked . If I tell you ! MOZART I promise , I promise ! MOZART We-ell . You remember our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who took a position as valet with the German prince Ferdinand ? MOZART The very one . I felt quite heart broken when he left us ! MOZART Nannerle ! You astonish me ! Our servant ! MOZART First you say my expectations are too high ! Now you are shocked that they are not high enough ! MOZART You are teasing me ! MOZART I used to have daydreams . The two of us running away . Leaving the rest of you on those long bumpy trips . MOZART Well , I have something up my sleeve . p. 38 MOZART Oh , do tell , Mama ! MOZART Oh . I do n't know . You might be too shocked . Like your father was when I told him . MOZART Oh come Mama ! MOZART Well , you must know that the position of valet to a prince is a very high one . MOZART Ye-es ? MOZART Higher than the position of court musician , for example . MOZART So ? MOZART So , by leaving us , his position became elevated above ours . MOZART Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to your father : Is n't it strange the prince should pick someone from so lowly a station ? MOZART Now you come to mention it . But he was very presentable ! MOZART Exactly ! MOZART What do you mean by that tone ? ( Imitating her mother ) Exactly ! MOZART Did you not notice how the prince could not take his eyes off young Sebastian ? And the other way round ? How they kept " accidentally " touching each other ? p. 39 MOZART I do n't understand ? What are you trying to say ? MOZART That you were not the only one who was infatuated with young Sebastian . There would have been no chance of the two of you running off ! MOZART But they were both men. ! MOZART Enough now of young Sebastian Winter ! MOZART No Mama ! Explain yourself ! What was it shocked Papa ? Tell ! MOZART Now , Now Nannerl ! Do n't play the innocent with me ! You know perfectly well what I am implying ! MOZART Come Mama , say it ! Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understood me right ! I can see from your face that you are teasing me ! But , infatuated with young Sebastian ! You were only twelve years old ! MOZART Thirteen actually , when he left us . Are you very shocked , Mama ? MOZART Very surprised ! MOZART You should not be ! You agreed that he was very personable ! Oh ! I had an infatuation at an even younger age ! MOZART Even younger ? MOZART I used to dream that one day I would marry Katejan Hagenauer . And become a member of the Hagenauer family . And Ursula would be my sister . And dear Frau Hagenauer my other mother ! p. 40 MOZART I never suspected ! How could you have been so secretive ! MOZART Oh , I 'm pretty good at keeping secrets ! MOZART So I am learning ! But Katejan ! A priest ! MOZART He was n't a priest then . After all , we both were children . MOZART Such a beautiful ceremony they had for his inauguration ! MOZART I 'd never seen St.Peter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Wolfgang 's Mass , specially composed for a dear family friend ! So moving , so beautiful ! MOZART And the celebration at the inn up on the mountain . The three of us performing , playing trios : Papa , Wolfl and I. All the while I was dreaming : this could have been my wedding celebration ! MOZART You did n't ! MOZART Oh yes , I did . MOZART What would Father Dominicus - as he is now - say if he heard these outrageous thoughts ! MOZART Well , he never will hear them now , will he ? MOZART I should hope not ! p. 41 MOZART I might as well tease you some more : say I have decided to become a nun because of lost love ! MOZART Heaven forbid ! I would like to see some grandchildren ! MOZART Ah ! There is also Wolfgang . He has been making eyes at Theresa Barisani ! MOZART Wolfl is still a child ! He first has to make a brilliant career for himself . As you well know ! MOZART ( impatiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here all alone . Two women confiding their secrets ! MOZART I wonder if they made it to Milan yet . Seems they keep getting held up . Admirers expecting one performance after the other ! MOZART Poor Papa ! He complains that the Italians are lavish with praise but stingy with material rewards . MOZART How fortunate that you are able to help ... ( Pauses , listens ) Wait ! I hear Theresel greeting someone ..... Oh ! I believe it is Captain D'Ippold ! MOZART ( nervously ) : Captain D'Ippold ? MOZART How nice ! He has been so kind to us womenfolk while the men are away . p. 42 MOZART Yes .... MOZART Well , let us receive him ! ( Moves toward the door ) Coming , Nannerle ? MOZART In a moment , Mama . I .... I just need a moment . MRS.MOZART exits.NANNERL paces to-and-fro nervously . Adjusts her skirt . Fusses with her hair . Mimes the motions of primping in a mirror . MOZART I do n't understand myself ! So many years I have known him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fluttering in my stomach ! My cheeks tingle . My fingers feel numb . I am afraid to meet his eyes . Afraid that he might see the storm inside ... ( Takes a deep breath and exits ) . @x ( sits at her desk , picks up her writing instrument , begins pensively ) : Salzburg . The summer of 1773 ..... MOZART ( enters , excited ) : Nannerl ! Stop that eternal writing ! Get your Mama ! You have to come with me and your Mama to have a look ! It is the most superb , most suitable place ! MOZART What is the commotion ? What is going on ? MOZART ( draws both women by the hand toward center stage ) : Come ! Off to the former Dance Master 's House ! MOZART The Dance Master 's House ? MOZART Look ! Is n't it magnificent ! MOZART It is so large ! MOZART The dancing master needed a great deal of space for his lessons . MOZART It is huge ! MOZART Now that Wolfgang is settled here , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us go inside ! ALL THREE step toward the back of the stage . MOZART Here we will arrange musical performances ! You too , Nannerl , will again be playing to larger groups of people . p. 44 MOZART It is very beautiful . But , can we afford it ? MOZART The question is : can we not afford it ? We have to keep up appearances ! MOZART There are so many rooms ! MOZART Nannerle , you shall have a room of your own ! There you can give your lessons undisturbed . Why should you always traipse to other homes ! Sometimes in bad weather ! And sometimes on poor instruments ! MOZART Oh Papa ! MOZART We do n't have enough furniture to fill the rooms ! MOZART We shall get furniture ! And only the best will do ! MOZART I fear there will be too much work for Theresel ... MOZART We will hire a second maid . Please , Annerle , take that anxious look from your face ! We can afford it ! MOZART Are you quite sure ? MOZART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments for our musical gatherings . I will discuss these with Wolfgang . Oh , where is Wolfgang ? MOZART In the garden . Setting up targets for games of shooting darts . p. 45 MOZART I will join him then . The matter of additional instruments is extremely urgent . ( Exits hurriedly ) MOZART I am worried . Such major expenses . MOZART Rest assured , Mama . Papa will not spend money unnecessarily . He is far too careful about what we spend ! MOZART True . MOZART So let us enjoy this ! All this space ! MOZART It is very beautiful . I 've longed for a garden of our own . MOZART And look ! Not only our own private garden . But the Mirabell palace gardens just steps away . MOZART Oh yes ! MOZART Let us stroll in our new neighborhood garden ! Where we can be seen and admired ! MOZART Nannerl ! You sound just like your Papa ! BOTH exit , laughing and conspiratorial . Groups of people , the citizens of Salzburg , are gathered together.Citizen no 1 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ! No 3 : Our kindly Count von Schrattenbach gone ! No 1 : They say the new one is cold.No 2 : And harsh ! Always cutting costs.Says he will reduce the number of saint days ! Shorten services ! Cancel race meetings And fairs ! And fireworks displays ! ! p. 46 MOZART ( walks to her writing desk and sits down ) : We were all deeply grieved when Archbishop Count von Schrattenbach died . They say his successor is a cold and harsh man . He has little respect for musicians . Does not hesitate to remind them that their rank stands no higher than other court servants ! ( ARCHBISHOP COLLEREDO ENTERS ) COUNT COLLOREDO I have a very busy schedule ! I do not appreciate unnecessary audiences ! MOZART Yes , your Grace . I do appreciate that your time is extremely valuable . I have made several requests already for an audience with your Holiness . COUNT COLLOREDO Yes , yes . I have been made aware of that fact . Please state the reason for your request ! I do not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highness must surely be aware that the talents of my son Wofgang have brought much fame and honor to the Court of Salzburg . COUNT COLLOREDO Yes , yes . But do get to the point Mozart ! MOZART My son 's genius is greatly appreciated in other Royal Courts throughout Europe . COUNT COLLOREDO I repeat : do get to the point , Mozart ! p. 47 MOZART Another European tour will greatly enhance that fame . And of course , the fame of the Court of Salzburg . The Archbishop Count von Schrattenbach always appreciated this . COUNT COLLOREDO Mozart ! I am not von Schrattenbach ! My predecessor has been excessively generous toward his employees ! More especially so with you and your son ! He has extended long leaves of absence while continuing in the employ of the Court ! MOZART Yes , your Grace ! And we have been duly grateful . Your Holiness will recall that my son 's music was performed at your inauguration . COUNT COLLOREDO Yes indeed . I also recall that the composition was intended for my predecessor . And was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Is this the reason for your request ? To inform me that the music performed at my inauguration was composed by your son ? MOZART I have come to request permission for myself and my son to undertake another European tour . I believe that our music is much in demand . COUNT COLLOREDO I must remind you again : both you and your son are in my employ . And that you have taken advantage of extended leaves in the past . MOZART May I respectfully remind your Grace that my son was not in your employ at that time ! p. 48 COUNT COLLOREDO Your behavior is bordering on insolence , Mozart ! MOZART You are refusing my request ? COUNT COLLOREDO I grant permission for your son to travel . But you , Mozart , will continue with your duties here at the Court of Salzburg . THE ARCHBISHOP EXITS . MOZART This has gone too far ! Too far ! MOZART What , Papa ? What happened ? MOZART What a commotion ! What is happening ? MOZART Count Colloredo ! This time he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? Reminded you again of your lowly position as servants of the court ? MOZART Be serious , Annerle ! This is an absolute disaster ! MOZART You have been fired ! MOZART No , no , not that ! There would be too much protest from higher places ! MOZART So , what then ? What has he done ? MOZART I requested another leave of absence . For me and Wolfgang to do a tour of German cities and of Paris . p. 49 MOZART He refused . You have to remain in Salzburg ? MOZART Not Quite . He says Wolfgang may go . But I have to remain at my post in Salzburg ! MOZART Oh , well then . Wolfl can not go on his own . He too will have to stay in Salzburg . MOZART Absolutely not ! I 'm sure that is what Colloredo thinks ! But Wolfgang must go . The Salzburg court is too restrictive ! MOZART You intend to let Wolfl travel on his own ? MOZART No ! Of course Wolfgang can not travel by himself ! MOZART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOZART Yes ? What may that be ? MOZART You dear Annerle will travel with your son . MOZART Oh no ! MOZART Oh yes . There is no other solution ! MOZART No ! You know how I hate traveling ! How I hate to be away from home ! MOZART Papa ? MOZART My dear ? MOZART Wolfgang is grown up now . He is twenty-one years old . Surely he can go on his own ! p. 50 MOZART Absolutely not ! He has to be protected from temptation ! MOZART Then perhaps I should go with him . MOZART What a crazy notion ! You have absolutely no control over your brother ! He will have you dancing to his tune ! MOZART I have no control over him ! He simply laughs at me ! MOZART You will have to treat matters more seriously ! Keep a tighter rein on your son ! MOZART I do n't want to leave Salzburg again ! I have been away too much ! ( Passionately ) I wo n't go ! MOZART You have no choice in the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good little mother . And go where your duty leads you . MOZART ( angrily rushes off ) . MOZART You have greatly upset Mama ! MOZART ( also angry ) : That can not be helped ! ( Storms out , following his wife . ) The stage is empty , piano music is heard for some moments . LEOPOLD enters , listens attentively for a while . MOZART Nannerl ! Nannerl , I am home . The music stops abruptly . p. 51 MOZART ( offstage ) : One moment Papa ! MOZART That music ! It is new ! MOZART ( entering ) : Yes Papa . MOZART Wolfgang has written ? MOZART Yes Papa . There are two letters : one from Wolfgang and one from Mama . MOZART And he sent you another composition ! For piano this time . I only heard a little of it coming home . It sounds interesting . Rather different from his usual . MOZART Different from his usual ? How different , Papa ? MOZART I will have to hear a little more to say exactly where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like it Papa ? MOZART Oh yes ! Very much so . He seems to be developing in a slightly different direction . Nannerl ! Why are you laughing like that ? MOZART ( shaking with laughter ) : Oh Papa ! MOZART Control yourself ! And state the source of your great amusement ! MOZART Oh Papa ! I played a trick on you ! p. 52 MOZART Played a trick ? MOZART That composition was mine ! And you praised it ! When you thought it was by Wolfgang ! MOZART An utterly silly trick ! Whatever possessed you ! MOZART I remembered when you took my little piece of music . From my notebook . And pretended it was from Wolfgang when you gave it to the Empress ! MOZART Not that again ! Now , where are those letters ? MOZART Here Papa . I will tell Theresel that you are home . ( exits ) MOZART ( opens the letters , appears to read for a while ) : This is too upsetting ! This is beyond belief ! MOZART ( enters ) : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the news is enough to make me ill ! MOZART What news , Papa ? News from Mama and Wolfgang ? MOZART Yes . Two letters . One from your mother . One from Wolfgang . MOZART What do they write ? What could upset you so ? MOZART Both letters are from Mannheim . Your brother has fallen into the clutches of the vilest family ! p. 53 MOZART I do n't understand . What family is this ? MOZART The family of Fridolin Weber . An impoverished copyist ! Your brother went to his house to have some music copied . And fell totally under their spell ! MOZART But how ? How could they do this ? MOZART He wants to rescue them ! Listen to this ( reading from the letter ) ... " ... came down in the world ... and so on ... and so on .... Was kicked out of service . Has a wife and five daughters to support . And Wolfgang totally besotted with one of them . Claims she is a great singer . At age sixteen ! MOZART Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolfgang fallen prey to these bohemians ! Musical lackeys ! Impoverished ! Loose living ! Lowly bred ! MOZART Please calm yourself . This may be a passing phase . Wolfgang often has such passing enthusiasms . MOZART Not this time ! Even your Mama is alarmed ! She is taking the situation very seriously . MOZART Oh ? MOZART Yes . I have her letter here . Written and sent secretly . She writes : Wolfgang wants to sacrifice everything for his new friends . Will not listen to reason . Wants to change all planned arrangements , to travel to Italy with Mr.Weber and two of his daughters . At his expense ! Wants to bring the Weber family to fame and fortune , convinced the sixteen-year-old Miss Weber will be in demand in all opera houses in Italy ! p. 54 MOZART He will not listen to Mama ? MOZART No ! She writes she has lost all control over him ! ( Sinking hid head into his hands , weeps audibly ) Gone are the happy hours ! MOZART kneels besides her father , takes both his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa ! . MOZART When he was a little boy he said he would build a glass case to protect me from the wind ! That he would always have me with him ! Always honor me ! MOZART Please Papa ! I am here ! I am with you ! I will always honor you ! MOZART ( disregards her pleas ) : He knows my wretched salary ! How much money was already wasted in Munich ! For nothing ! All for nothing ! The idea of traveling with Mr.Weber and his two daughters ! Paying their expenses ! And your mother unable to stop him ! MOZART Papa ! Please ! MOZART Taking them to Italy at our expense ! Yes ! At our expense ! His earnings do n't nearly cover the expenses of the trip ! How often has he appealed to you for funds ? MOZART Sometimes . I have always earned enough to help . p. 55 MOZART And here I stay behind ! My dressing gown is so frayed I run to the back when someone calls in the morning ! I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer have any black hose . I had to wear white hose these past two Sundays ! MOZART Come , Papa . Tomorrow you will write Wolfgang a letter . You write him all you told me . And that there will be no more money coming from Salzburg if he goes to Italy ! MOZART ( calmer ) : You are so sensible , my dear daughter . And what will I write to your dear Mama ? MOZART The same , of course . MOZART She has been so upset . She wants to come home . She does not want to continue with the journey . MOZART Poor Mama ! She did not want to go ! They should both come home ! The trip has not been successful . It seems that there are no vacancies in the German courts . MOZART Paris will be different ! We made good connections there . There Wolfgang will be received with open arms ! MOZART Tomorrow you will write to both Wolfgang and Mama . And I am sure everything will be sorted out . MOZART I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take you to have new shoes made . And buy black hose . I have some money set aside . MOZART What an excellent daughter I have ! I will start on those letters right away ! ( Exits ) . LEOPOLD and NANNERL are sitting side by side , apparently looking at some musical scores . A knock is heard at the door . LEOPOLD rises and his voice is heard offstage . MOZART Abbe Bullinger ? A message from my son ? A message from Wolfgang ? A letter ? MOZART ( rises to meet her father ) : I heard ! A letter from Wolfgang ! Here ! Let me see ! Just imagine ! A letter by personal delivery ! MOZART ( silently places the letter on the chair , and prepares to leave the room ) . MOZART ( picks up the letter , and reads ) : Oh no ! No , no , no ! Not Mama ! Oh no ! Mama , Mama , Mama ! This can not be true ! Oh , my Mama , my dearest Mama ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Papa ! Do n't walk away ! Papa ! Come back here ! Oh Papa , you should not have sent her away ! She did not want to go ! And you forced her ! Yes , you forced her ! The lighting changes . Brightness is concentrated on the writing desk . p. 57 MOZART ( at the desk , apparently writing ) : So that day , when Mama and I held each other close as if we would never see each other again , was indeed the last time . Mama died in Paris . That was on the third of July in 1778 . She lies in the cemetery at St.Eustache . During the dark days following Mama 's death , it is Franz who comforts me . Takes me for long walks in the gardens of Mirabell . Always lets me talk about Mama , reviving little memories . Keeps her alive for me in that way .. Always reminds me that he too knew Mama , and loved her well . MOZART Another long walk ? MOZART Yes Papa . MOZART Any news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No letter . MOZART No word yet ! It has been months ! He should have come home directly to be a comfort to us ! MOZART Yes , Papa . He is staying on with the Weber family in Mannheim . MOZART The Weber family ! Always the Weber family ! What dreadful hold do they have over my son ! MOZART I do not know , Papa ! He does not write to me in his usual way ! I feel he has quite forgotten us ! ( Hurries offstage , visibly upset ) p. 58 MOZART So , he has returned . Finally . MOZART But is very unhappy here . MOZART With good reason ! Colloredo is making his life a misery . MOZART And has now summoned him to Vienna . To entertain personal guests in his residence . MOZART Using and exploiting my son ! To glorify himself ! MOZART ( hurries on-stage ) : Nannerl ! Nannerl ! Where are you ? MOZART Here , Papa . MOZART The most distressing news from Vienna ! MOZART Has something happened to my brother ? MOZART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOZART He was fired ? MOZART No ! Not fired ! Walked out ! Removed himself ! MOZART What happened ? MOZART Wolfgang writes that Colloredo deliberately tried to humiliate him at every turn ! When Wolfgang got an engagement to perform for fees in Vienna , Colloredo would summon his services at exactly that time ! And made him eat with the servants ! At the low end of the table . With the gardeners , below the valets , along with the other court musicians . p. 59 MOZART He wanted to remind my brother of his place in the palace hierarchy ? MOZART Exactly ! As invited guest in other houses he is lavishly entertained ! Treated with the respect his genius deserves ! MOZART What will he do now ? MOZART But worst of all ! Oh worst of all ! MOZART What , Papa ? MOZART He has moved in with the Weber women ! MOZART In Vienna ? They are no longer in Mannheim ? MOZART No . No . Mr.Weber died , and the Widow Weber moved to Vienna with her brood of daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he made straight for the Weber brood ! MOZART I thought all that was over . MOZART Apparently not ! How can this be stopped ! MOZART I do n't know , Papa . I do n't think we can . MOZART Oh ! I can foretell exactly what will happen ! MOZART Papa ? MOZART The widow Weber will have my son for one of her daughters ! p. 60 MOZART Aloysia ? The one he wanted to take to Italy ? The one he was so smitten with ? MOZART No , that one got married . But , you can be sure ! One of those women will be foisted upon my naive , inexperienced , gullible son ! ( Leaves the stage in a highly agitated state ) MOZART ( takes a few steps forward to communicate with the audience:And Papa was right . It was Konstanze who drew him into the web . Or rather , according to Papa , Mrs. Weber who drew my brother into the web for Konstanze . In spite of my father 's threats of poverty and rejection , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in spite of promises to bring his bride to Salzburg to meet us , it took almost two years before they made their appearance . MOZART ( entering ) : So , Wolfgang has taken her on a sightseeing tour of Salzburg . MOZART Yes . And to meet some of his friends . MOZART They should return soon . Have you made arrangements for dinner with Theresel and Nandl ? MOZART Yes , Papa . Everything is taken care of . MOZART I noticed that Viktoria was here this morning . For a hairdressing coffee ? p. 61 MOZART Yes . Of all my friends she is the best at building up my hair . I want to look my best for our musical evening tonight . ( Assumes a listening posture ) Oh ! I hear voices ! I think they are arriving . KONSTANZE Oh ! What an exhausting day ! MOZART You walked a great deal ? KONSTANZE Oh yes ! What a charming little town Salzburg is ! MOZART Where is Wolfgang ? I thought I heard his voice ? KONSTANZE Oh , he met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ippold ? KONSTANZE Quite an admirer of one Miss Mozart , I hear ! MOZART Captain D ' Ippold has been very kind to the family . KONSTANZE As I was saying : the good Captain was on his way here when Wolfgang decided to take him along to visit his old friend Michael Haydn . MOZART You chose not to go ? KONSTANZE All that walking ! My feet are quite dead already ! ( Pauses ) Oh Nannerl ! I see you have had your hair dressed this morning ! p. 62 MOZART Yes . I have a number of friends who come for a coffee to help me . But Viktoria is the best . KONSTANZE Quite a tower she managed on your head ! MOZART Thank you ! I could arrange a session for you if you wish . KONSTANZE Good heavens no ! In Vienna those stiff fashions are quite out of style . Stiffness in dress and hair is considered quite small town and outmoded in the fashion capital ! MOZART I have n't been to Vienna in a very long time . MOZART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest styles . Our clothes were of the finest quality . We had private tailors and private coiffeurs . Only the best was good enough for us ! KONSTANZE Oh ! That is how my dear husband acquired his expensive tastes ! MOZART Perhaps . In self-promotion the image one creates is of the utmost importance . KONSTANZE I am sure . And talking of the tours , Wolfl tells me you acquired quite a treasure trove ! Gifts bestowed by Royalty and rich merchants alike ! MOZART Appreciation of the children 's ' talents was expressed . Yes . p. 63 KONSTANZE In gold , I believe , and silver . In precious stones . In silks . And laces . MOZART That is correct . KONSTANZE Please , please ! Can I see the pretty things ? MOZART Perhaps tonight . When Wolfgang and our guests are here . The gifts may serve to bring back memories . KONSTANZE Oh yes . yes ! And Wolfgang and I can take them back to Vienna when we return ! MOZART No ! KONSTANZE Why not ? Were these presents not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MOZART And mine ! MOZART Nannerl too had her share ! Many were jointly presented ! ( Firmly ) Anyway , the largest proportion was sold . KONSTANZE Sold ? MOZART By my friend and patron , Herr Hagenauer . There were many debts to pay . Many expenses were incurred in setting up this house . KONSTANZE Oh ? But some were kept back ? MOZART Yes , those Herr Hagenauer refused to sell . Mostly gifts from Imperial and Royal Highnesses . Those have been labeled according to their donors . Herr Hagenhauer felt they belong in a museum . And I agree . Most certainly a museum will be established one day to honor the genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ! p. 64 KONSTANZE Well , we shall see . I shall discuss this with my husband , of course . MOZART ( stiffly ) : Of course . KONSTANZE Now I shall go and have a rest . I still tire easily after the birth of little Raimundo . ( Turns to leave , then changes her mind ) : Oh ! We had a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace ) : Oh ? You did ? Whom did you meet ? KONSTANZE Maria Theresia von Paradis ! MOZART The blind pianist from Vienna ! KONSTANZE None other ! MOZART Here in Salzburg ? Oh Papa ! We could invite her here ! KONSTANZE Already done ! Wolfgang has invited her for the musical evening tonight . And promised to compose a piece for her . MOZART I have heard that the von Paradis plays quite competently . But I believe our Nannerl exceeds her in precision and clarity . You know , of course , that when Nannerl was but twelve years old , the critics in London voted her the most accomplished pianist in the whole of Europe . KONSTANZE So her brother has told me . Many times . More is the pity then . p. 65 MOZART The pity ? KONSTANZE The pity , yes . That you did not continue with your own musical career ! MOZART You must know why she remained in Salzburg ! KONSTANZE Yes ? MOZART Teaching music ! To help finance Wolfgang 's further musical development in Italy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My husband 's genius is such that it would surely have flowered on its own ! No sacrifices would have been necessary ! MOZART All sacrifices were gladly made ! All help gladly given ! KONSTANZE Oh well . Fortunately for the von Paradis she had no gifted brother ! Imagine ! Making her way across Europe in spite of her blindness ! Accompanied only by her mother . I believe too , she does some composing . ) You too , Nannerl . According to your brother . NANNERL ( turns away abruptly ) . KONSTANZE And so young ! Only four years older than I ! And what , maybe eight years younger than you , Nannerl ? ( Exits with a lively bounce , not at all like one worn out by recent childbirth ) NANNERL ( remains standing stiffly , her back to the audience ) . p. 66 MOZART I hear them coming back ! Wolfgang and Captain D ' Ippold ! I hear their voices in the garden ... MOZART Let us join them . They may want to play a game of darts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa . At once Papa . MOZART exits . MOZART ( remains , fusses with her skirt and hair ) : Although we meet so often now , each expected meeting with Franz still fills me with shivers of pleasure . Papa would be horrified ! Fortunately our private meetings are in public places ! Or I would long have lost control ! Only Wolfl knows of the happy turmoil within me . He has been the trusted guardian of my secret longing ..... Several young men saunter on stage , one of them carrying a large round board depicting a red robed figure in a kneeling position , facing the rear end of a small fair youth . The other men are carrying feathered arrows . Various comments are made:Back to the game ! Me first ! No , no ! Let me ! No , I got the target ! I 'll catch you ! I will too ! Just you try ! They run off laughing , the youth with the target in the lead . The light changes , darkens . MOZART ( paces up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Please hurry , Papa ! Please hurry Franz ! I can hardly keep still for happiness ! It has been so long , so many years ! I have held Franz in deep affection for so long . Only Wolfgang knows of my secret attachment . At first my feelings were of gratitude . Franz has been so kind to our family , so helpful . So well hidden were my feelings that even Franz was surprised that I returned his affection when he made a proposal of marriage to me. p. 67 MOZART ( enters ) : Ah ! Nannerl ! There you are ! MOZART ( runs toward him ) : Papa ! Oh , Papa , I am so happy ! I have waited so long for this ! MOZART Sit down , please . Calm yourself . MOZART We want to be married as soon as possible . Perhaps Father Dominicus Hagenauer .... MOZART Nannerl ! Slow down ! MOZART Yes ? MOZART I have refused permission for this marriage to take place . MOZART You .. you what ? MOZART Refused permission for this marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa ? MOZART I felt you deserve better . MOZART Deserve better ? How can that be ? Franz and I love each other ! MOZART His situation as headmaster of the boys ' academy does not bring in the kind of income to support you in the style you deserve . MOZART Papa ! I do not need a luxurious life style ! I have always been able to add to the family income ! Have done so for years ! And will happily do so now ! p. 68 MOZART First your brother defies me in his choice of marriage partner . And now you ! My loyal dutiful daughter is prepared to let her father down too ? Your brother married without my permission , without my approval .... MOZART I do not need your permission ! I will marry Franz without your consent ! I will go to him directly ! MOZART It is too late for that . He will not marry you now . MOZART Why not ? What have you told him ? MOZART I persuaded him that you were deserving of something better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the background . For your sake . For your well-being ! MOZART For my well-being ! MOZART I am sure something will turn up . You are still a beautiful woman . It is generally agreed that you have not lost in youthful allure . MOZART Papa ! I am almost thirty years old ! This was probably my last chance at happiness ! And I WILL go to Franz ! I will run after him now ! NANNERL runs across the stage , but is caught by LEOPOLD who pulls her back forcibly . MOZART I told you ! It is no use ! He gave me his word ! He agreed that you deserve better ! p. 69 MOZART He would refuse me ? MOZART Yes ! That is what I am telling you . He is a man of honour ! He gave me his word ! NANNERL ( Stumbles onto the lowest level , seats herself at her desk , and picks up her quill as if preparing to write ) LEOPOLD exits . MOZART ( puts down her quill , closes the journal ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ! I order you to come out ! MOZART No , Papa ! I will not come out ! MOZART You have not eaten for days ! Please come out . I worry about your health . MOZART Go away Papa ! I do not wish to speak with you ! LEOPOLD exits , re-enters after some moments . MOZART Nannerl ! This has gone too far ! Your students want to know what is happening . MOZART Tell them I am ill ! MOZART I have written to Wolfgang to make you see sense . MOZART Wolfgang has written to me . MOZART Good ! Good ! What does he write ? p. 70 MOZART He pleads that I go to Franz with a proposal to elope to Vienna . He assures me that I will earn enough with my music to support us both . MOZART Another betrayal ! But you can not go ! Franz will not be persuaded ! He is too proud to be supported by a woman ! MOZART I will go on my own ! MOZART Nannerl , my Nannerl ! You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now you ! MOZART Please do n't cry Papa ! Please do n't cry ! MOZART Please come out , Nannerle ! Please come out to comfort your poor Papa ! NANNERL ( joins her father ) MOZART You have taken pity on your poor Papa . MOZART No , Papa . I can no longer resist the small of Palatschinken with chocolate sauce . As you know , a taste for chocolate is my passion ! LEOPOLD exits in obvious disgust . NANNERL is seated at her desk . MOZART ( enters , rushes toward Nannerl ) : Wonderful news ! Absolutely wonderful news ! NANNERL ( looks at her father , but does not respond ) . MOZART I have been approached for your hand in marriage ! p. 71 MOZART Oh ? And you refused ? MOZART I knew it ! I always knew I was right to reject your suitors in the past ! I knew that in the end the right offer would come . MOZART Who made the offer , then ? MOZART An aristocrat . Highly educated , a graduate at the Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Occupies a position of high rank . MOZART I do n't know anyone like that . Perhaps Papa fell asleep and had a dream ? MOZART Oh no , Nannerle ! This is no dream ! You are about to become the Baroness von Berchtold zu Sonnenburg ! ( Bows ostentatiously ) My daughter , the Baroness ! ( Exits with a flourish ) The light dims to near darkness . A number of people are gathered at the front of the stage , with their attention directed upward . A group of three women stands together , somewhat separate from the rest . Comments , exclamations from the group : Married to the Baron ! A baroness now ! The baron , twice widowed ! Five surviving children ! A handful , they say Court Councillor at Salzburg . And warden of St. Gilgen . So was her maternal grandfather.The main focus shifts to the three female friends : No 1 : She will be moving to St. Gilgen , you know . No.2 Iinto the same house where her mother grew up ! No.3 : Imagine that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should have married the captain . Broke her heart , you know ! No.3 : Here she comes ! No.1 : Look ! How drab ! How dull ! Dressed in brown ! No.3 : Oh no ! She who loves those heavenly shades of blue ! No.2 : And old rose , a favourite of hers . The group comes closer : Comments : Lovely she looks ! Never take her for over thirty ! There they are ! Look , look ! NANNERL appears on one of the higher levels of the stage : Now I am the Baroness von Berchtold zu Sonnenburg . I move into the home where my mother was born , and where she spent her girlhood years . In the late autumn I realize that I am pregnant . I become intensely aware of the cycle of growth around me : swollen apples lying on the ground ; leaves changing colour , blanketing the rotten fruit . Covered in turn by the first snow . A sleeping world , dreaming of spring . ( Descends onto the lower stage . Crosses this from end-to-end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake ) . As the weather turns cold and whitens the lake , I go for long walks . This is where my Mama walked many times . As I am walking now , on the same paths , in the same landscape.I miss Mama intensely . I can feel her presence right beside me . On occasion I talk to her : Oh , Mama , what am I to do ? I feel so lonely in that big , dark house ! I can not control my stepchildren : the four boys absolutely defy my authority ! I feel the child growing within me . How can I look after another child ? I feel so confused ! I feel so frightened ! So frightened of the confinement ! So helpless ! There is no one to talk to , no one to ask for advice ! Vividly , as in a waking dream , Mama strides along with me . We laugh , share womanly secrets , giggle like young girls . No longer the Baroness , but Nannerl and her Mama , two Mozart women together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind blowing from the lake . ( Nannerl moves off stage . The stage remains empty for some moments.NANNERL enters , walking very slowly , heavily burdened by a late pregnancy . From the lowest level , she takes a step upward . p. 72 MOZART ( calls ) : Pa-pah-ah ! Are you at home , Papa ? MOZART ( enters ) : Nannerl ? Nannerle ! MOZART Oh Papa , Papa ! MOZART Dear , dearest Nannerl ! Should you have traveled in your condition ? MOZART Oh Papa ! I had to come ! I had to come home ! MOZART ( happily ) : This is home ? St. Gilgen is not home then ? ( Leads her gently to be seated ) But sit down ! Sit down and rest ! MOZART I am so frightened ! So alone ! MOZART Not alone ! Never alone with your dear Papa by your side ! MOZART And my brother never writes to me . A horrible coldness has come between us ! MOZART Ah ! That is the doing of Konstanze ! She is still angry because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( hesitant ) : Wolfgang pleaded for a little piece of jewelry . A trinket perhaps . To comfort her after the death of little Raimundo . Perhaps we should have ..... MOZART ( interrupts ) : Little Raimundo ! Your brother wrote that if he had a son he would name him after me ! Leopold , Leopold Mozart ! After me ! p. 73 MOZART And then he did not . MOZART No ! I believe Konstanze did not like the name ! Or perhaps her mother , the widow Weber , preferred Raimundo " . Raimundo ! MOZART Hush Papa ! If this is a boy , I shall most certainly name him after you ! MOZART Oh Nannerl ! My loyal Nannerl who never breaks a promise ! MOZART Only days now . It should be within a few days now . MOZART Perhaps for your own birthday ! Come , no more gloomy thoughts ! Smell the roses in Mirabell gardens . Even here the sweet scent reaches us ! MOZART Yes , Papa . Already I am less afraid ... MOZART I will find Theresel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to Doctor Barisani to arrange for your confinement ! ( Leaves hurriedly while Nannerl remains seated ) THE LIGHT DIMS , THEN BRIGHTENS . MOZART ( still seated ) : I give birth in my beloved Salzburg . After hours of painful labor , I hold my baby son in my arms . I shall name him Leopold , in honor of dear Papa . Papa , holding and cradling the infant , is beside himself with joy . p. 74 MOZART ( enters ) : Little Leopold is sleeping now . I rocked him to sleep . Sang him a lullaby . MOZART Thank you , Papa . MOZART He will be a truly great musician ! MOZART Oh Papa ! It is far too early to tell ! MOZART Oh no ! I am the expert teacher after all ! It is the shape of that little hand ! The spread of those fingers ! Even in sleep that hand rests as if on a keyboard . MOZART Papa ! He is newly born ! He does n't know about keyboards yet ! MOZART OH , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something inherited ! MOZART Come , Papa ! It was your teaching , our hard work that produced the music my brother and I made . MOZART Of course ! That too ! I will teach this little one as soon as he is able to understand . Little Leopold ! He will receive the best musical training ever ! MOZART I thought my brother and I had that ! MOZART Oh but I too learnt from teaching the two of you . I know exactly where to make further improvements in my method ! p. 75 MOZART You made mistakes ? You admit that ? MOZART We-ell . Not mistakes exactly . But there are little things that can be improved upon . MOZART Oh , do tell , Papa ! MOZART Oh no ! You will read all about it in my next book . Already promised to the publisher of my previous book MOZART Tell me , Papa : have not my brother and I good examples of your teaching method ? MOZART The best ! Excellent examples ! MOZART I miss teaching music . It gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had hoped your marriage would relieve you of that . MOZART I know , I know . Fortunately the oldest , Marianne , is interested in music . She is the only one of the children who accepts me .... MOZART I know ! A rowdy , ill mannered , undisciplined lot they are ! The oldest should be sent to school here in Salzburg . To learn to respect law and order ! And the others to follow as soon as they are of an age ! MOZART I know . I have suggested this to Johann . MOZART And ? p. 76 MOZART He refuses to see a problem . He says that I am overly fussy , overly sensitive . MOZART All the more reason for little Leopold to remain here ! To be reared in a refined and cultured atmosphere ! MOZART Papa ! You were the one to tell me how refined and cultured my husband - to - be was ! High born , aristocratic , highly educated ! A graduate of the Benedictine University , in possession of a Masters ' degree ! MOZART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unable to impart some of these qualities to his sons . Now little Leopold , my little Leopold , will be quite differently raised ! MOZART How so ? MOZART His musical training will begin early , to be honed and polished later . I will personally train him in the Classics , in Mathematics , in Latin , in Italian . MOZART You did all that with Wolfgang . MOZART I know , I know . But this will be on a more systematic basis . With little Leopold I will succeed where I failed with Wolfgang ! MOZART Failed with Wolfgang ? He is quite famous , as you know . Michael Haydn believes he is the greatest musician the world has ever known ! p. 77 MOZART He could have been even greater ! Achieved even more ! Had he not fallen in the web of the Weber women ! Weber . Weber ... Weaver . Weavers of spider webs ! And Widow Weaver , the Giant Spider , surrounded by her web spinning daughters ! And my poor son got entrapped in their sticky , poisonous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Konstanze , but she does not seem to have done his music any harm . MOZART How do we know that ! He might have been even greater ! MOZART I suppose we can not tell . Maybe he needed to grow up , to leave us . MOZART Never ! Now , little Leopold , he will be different . He will not let us down . He will devote his life to music . I will surround him with an invisible wall . Nothing bad or poisonous will come near him ! MOZART Papa ! You frighten me ! MOZART Frighten you ? Why , my child ? MOZART You make it sound like a prison ! An invisible wall around my baby son ! MOZART Oh no ! Not a prison , my dear daughter ! A protective casing . MOZART Nevertheless , a prison ! MOZART A protective glass case . You remember what little Wolfgang said ? That when he grew up he would put me in a glass case ? p. 78 MOZART Yes , Papa .... MOZART To protect me from the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe forever ? MOZART I remember . MOZART And so it will be with little Leopold . MOZART I am tired now , Papa . Let us discuss this at another time . MOZART Of course , of course ! You should rest ! You have always been in delicate health . Theresel and Nandel will take good care of him . MOZART Perhaps one of them will bring little Leopold to rest beside me . He is my little boy after all ! MOZART Of course , of course ! But you do remember what I said when I first held him in my arms ! MOZART Papa ? MOZART I said it was a miracle . Another gift from God . And prayed God would never , never let him go . MOZART Yes , Papa . You said that . You were so happy . So relieved that he was healthy . MOZART And I meant it ! Little Leopold ! A second chance ! When he reaches the age of three , I will begin his daily musical instruction . p. 79 MOZART That may be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilgen . MOZART But I told you ! Told you as soon as he was born ! MOZART Told me what , Papa ? MOZART That I will keep him with me ! That I will never let him go ! MOZART That can not be ! MOZART Nannerl ! My loyal daughter ! You can not deny me this wish ! This time my little genius , my little Leopoldel , will not desert me ! He will carry on where your brother left off ! He will be my comfort , my solace in old age ! MOZART You want a replacement for my brother ! MOZART Of course ! Even better : he will carry my name ! MOZART Papa , please ! He is my little son ! One thing of my very own ! His real father may object ! MOZART His real father already has five children ! ( Takes Nannerl 's hands ) When you came to your Papa to give birth in his home , I half thought you were bringing the infant to me as a gift . When it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . Of course little Leopold is a gift ! But a grandson , not a son ! p. 80 MOZART His real father has hardly bothered with the birth . Did not come to see his new son yet . Why ! Even Captain D'Ippold has shown greater concern ! MOZART So I have noticed . Franz would have been a very tender father ... But Papa , I shall have to return to St. Gilgen myself ! MOZART Oh , not too soon ! I shall inform my son-in-law that you need to recover your strength . You can not handle a large household with five children yet . As well as a young infant . In fact , I shall get down to it right away ! ( Exits ) MOZART Papa ! Please listen to me ! I must return to St. Gilgen ! MOZART There is no must ! You will remain ! MOZART I can not remain ! My heart breaks every time I see Franz with little Leopold in his arms ! I want to run to him ! Beg him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe this ! I am left speechless ! MOZART For once ! MOZART I will tell him to leave ! MOZART Not again ! Not again ! I have never forgiven you for that ! Never ! Never ! MOZART Nannerl ! p. 81 MOZART I can not remain : I can no longer resist the temptation ! We have to leave , little Leopold and I ! MOZART Never ! Little Leopold will remain with his grandfather . Wolfgang deserted me ! Betrayed his father ! I made many sacrifices for Wolfgang ! My second volume never saw the light of day ! I was too busy promoting your brother 's career ! Little Leo is my second chance ! He will not leave Salzburg ! MOZART I too , I made many sacrifices ! And Mama ! My dearest Mama ! This sacrifice is asking too much ! The light becomes dim.As usual . I find it impossible to deny or defy my father . Whenever I make any attempt to re-claim my son , Papa makes it impossible for me . He becomes almost tearful , and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gathered on stage , apparently watching the activity on one side : She is leaving . Alone . Yes , he wo n't let the infant go . Wants to keep him forever . Monstrous ! Look , here she comes now . Without the infant . How sad she looks ! How can she bear it ? How can she allow it ? And look ! Running to catch the carriage ! Captain D'Ippold ! Carrying a basket of apples ! Apples to comfort his old sweetheart ! As she returns to the sour old baron and his brood of noisy boys ! NANNERL rises , moves to sit at her desk , and mimes writing in her journal : Papa did not live long enough to begin the musical instruction of his beloved little Leopold . Maybe this was a blessing for both of them . Papa was spared another big disappointment , for little Leopold was completely and totally unmusical ! CHANGE OF LIGHTING . p. 82 MOZART ( carrying a bunch of wildflowers ) : Oh , it is so good to be back in Salzburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even my burial place is secured here in the family plot owned by the family of my late husband . I shall rest beside my father and my beloved daughter . My dear Mama should have been resting there , not buried in far away France . I have never been able to visit her grave to place flowers on her saint 's day . And my poor brother ! Resting in a common grave , his remains never to be traced . ( Kneels down ) . My little Jeanette . Today is your Saints day . And your Mama has come to bring flowers to put on your grave . I picked them myself , on the hillside at the Nonnberg . Little wildflowers that you loved so much . Maybe you are looking down from heaven ? And see that I brought chocolate ? Oh , how the two of us would sit down to enjoy the sweetness of chocolate . To sweeten our lives , we laughed . After your Papa died and we moved to Salzburg , a whole new world opened for you . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in their home . Right opposite the house where your Uncle Wolfgang and I were born . How he would have loved you ! And my Mama , your dear grandmamma ! People say you looked like her . They say that she and your grandpapa were the handsomest couple in all of Salzburg ! How pretty you looked on your sixteenth birthday ! We had a special party at the inn on the mountain to celebrate . You were the picture of rosy health and beauty ! Such a sparkling sprite you were ! No one expected you to get ill so suddenly , so soon after ! Even in the house full of doctors you could not be saved . I know , my little one , you would not want me to be sad forever . Here , I will eat my chocolate and pretend we are enjoying it together ! Goodbye , my sweet daughter , and rest peacefully . This is a lullaby we used to sing . Your Uncle Wolfgang composed this tune , a variation of an old folk song : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star ) : Sparkle , sparkle , lovely sprite , Thank you for your tiny light , To help me see which way to go Still a beacon in my night , Forever sparkle lovely sprite , Forever sparkle in my sight . ( Slowly walks away ) p. 83 KONSTANZE ( enters , in apparent animated conversation with a friend , ) Yes ! So we decided to move to Salzburg ! So charming ! So refreshing after those big cities ! And , of course , it was the home of my late first husband , the famous Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . Yes , yes , of course you knew that ! As does everyone in this town ! My present husband and I are working on a biography of his life . Are we contacting his sister for interviews ? Alas , she has been most reluctant to respond to our approaches ! Poor , woman probably does not wish to open old wounds ... Ah ! But look ! Here we meet each other on the street ! MOZART ( stops as she catches sight of Konstanze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I recognized you immediately ! MOZART ( coldly ) : Mrs.Nissen . KONSTANZE Such formality ! I suppose I should address you as Baroness von Berchthold zu Sonnenburg ? MOZART If you wish . KONSTANZE My ! How we have risen in the world ! I too am no longer plain Mrs. Nissen . My husband and I are presently von Nissen ! MOZART ( aside ) : I believe the " von " is self-bestowed. p. 84 KONSTANZE Excuse me ! I could not quite hear what you said ? MOZART ( coughs lightly ) : Nothing of importance , I am sure ! KONSTANZE Dear Nannerl ! You must come to visit us both . There is so much to discuss . We have a house for the summer up on the Nonnberg . Such magnificent views ! In good weather we have coffee and cake out in the garden . Overlooking the town . You must come to join us ! MOZART Thank you . KONSTANZE You will contact us then ? MOZART I will consult my appointment book . ( Nods coolly , and haughtily walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues her conversation ) : So , you see how it is . We make every effort at friendly hospitality . And are consistently met with cold rebuff . Of course , I think it had a great deal to do with the affairs of their father 's estate . Wolfgang was largely excluded in the will . His sister had been named the chief heiress . While my husband and I were struggling with debts ! In considerable financial difficulties ! And she , well provided for in an aristocratic marriage ! Wolfgang pleaded that she make the inheritance over to him And she , she absolutely refused ! Said it would betray her father 's wishes . Imagine ! Said it would be disloyal to the expressed wishes of her father as stated in his last will and testament . In the end she gave in . I think she always resented that her brother had first place in her father 's heart . No matter how hard she tried , no matter how angry his father was with Wolfgang , she knew her brother still held the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a battle for her father 's love . ( Shrugs her shoulders , and laughs ) But come ! Let us not spoil this lovely day ! ( Exits ) p. 85 MOZART ( Re-enters on one of the higher levels on the stage , addressing an unseen visitor ) : Come inside ! Oh ! What an unpleasant encounter ! All these years I thought she would permanently settle in Denmark . And her so called approaches ! Utterly hypocritical ! On the pretense of wanting assistance in the writing of my brother 's biography ! You know , of course , what happened to my brother 's earlier biography ? Oh , you must remember ! Konstanze bought and destroyed the entire second edition ! Because it showed her in a bad light ! And this from a widow who claimed to be in a totally impoverished circumstance ! Benefit concert after benefit concert was given ! For years to come ! To lighten the burden of the poor starving widow ! Enormous profits were made in the large cities of Europe . Even as long as seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's inheritance handed over to them . At Wolfgang 's request . But surely pressured and instigated by Konstanze ! And you know the latest ! For years of course we have known that she cut up musical scores with scissors . Because she got better prices by the piece ! But the latest ! The very latest ! She is selling so called combings of his hair ! My goodness ! From the amount sold my brother must have had an enormous head of hair ! ( Exits , laughing scornfully ) . A CHANGE IN LIGHTING . NANNERL ( is seated . Her expression is stern ) . p. 86 KONSTANZE ( enters ) : Ah ! Here I am ! At the specific invitation of the Baroness . After living for years in the same town ! MOZART Good afternoon Mrs.Nissen . KONSTANZE I was most surprised to receive your invitation ! MOZART Hardly an invitation in the usual sense . KONSTANZE No ? I see no table set out for afternoon coffee . No servant in evidence to enquire after my preference . MOZART No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for one specific purpose . KONSTANZE Which is ? MOZART To verify a piece of news which has been brought to my attention . KONSTANZE Yes ? MOZART First let me express my regrets , my sympathy , on the death of your second husband . KONSTANZE Thank you . MOZART It has been brought to my attention that you made application - and were granted - for your late husband to be buried in the plot of the family von Berchthold zu Sonnenburg . The plot owned by the family of my late husband . p. 87 KONSTANZE That is correct . MOZART On what grounds ? KONSTANZE Firstly , on the grounds of family relationship . My father-in-law , Leopold Mozart , is buried there . So is my niece , your daughter Jeanette . MOZART Those are the ones you claim as close family relationships ! My daughter you have never met ! KONSTANZE My late husband , Mr. Nissen , deserves a resting place in the aristocratic family plot . Which , by virtue of your marriage , is also the family plot of your brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot are responsible for the costs of upkeep . That removes the financial burden from my poor shoulders . MOZART Your arrogance is beyond belief ! My poor brother rests in an unknown mass grave ! KONSTANZE Hear me out ! By virtue of your marriage your brother would have been entitled to rest there . Therefore also the sons of your late brother . Mr. Nissen raised them as if they were his own . He was a good father to the sons of your brother , who left them ill provided for . Where were you , for example ? What interest did you ever show in your little nephews ? MOZART I lost touch . You never wrote . I did not know where to find you . p. 88 KONSTANZE Again I was the one expected to ask for help or favors ! And certain to be rejected ! As I had been in the past ! You could have found them ! I know for a fact that you have a wide network of acquaintances that keep you well informed ! MOZART Yes ! So well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While you were the wife of my brother ! That the paternity of some of his children was in serious doubt ! KONSTANZE Surely you paid no attention to such malicious rumors ! MOZART In Vienna it is said that the youngest boy is in fact the son of Franz Xavier Suessmayer . The dates of conception do not match my brother 's presence . But they do match - perfectly- with Suessmayer 's visits to the spa during your expensive treatments there ! And you named the infant Franz Xavier ! After his presumptive father ! KONSTANZE You disgust me ! MOZART And you me ! KONSTANZE I believe that age and sickness have addled your brain ! I believe that you have gone completely mad ! All those sacrifices you made ! Gave up your musical career ! Teaching to swell the family purse for your brother 's Italian tour ! Serving as a household drudge for your father ! They say that sacrifice ennobles . From what I see , sacrifice embitters ! p. 89 MOZART Sacrifices gladly made ! Gladly given ! KONSTANZE Gladly ! You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain ! Even your aristocratic marriage offered small reward ! MOZART How dare you ! KONSTANZE At least your brother and I were happy together . There was laughter in our marriage , a great deal of fun . Oh , how we enjoyed each other physically ! MOZART Spare me the details ! KONSTANZE Very well . I doubt that you would understand . MOZART You claim the right for your late husband to be buried in the family plot on the basis of my marriage to the baron ? So that you , as my sister-in-law- along with your relatives- have earned the right to be buried in the family plot ! That my brother would have been entitled to rest there ? KONSTANZE That is correct . MOZART Unfortunately , when my poor brother was laid to rest , you found no convenient plot to spare you the costs of upkeep ! You arranged for my brother 's remains to be tossed into a common grave ! Where no memorial could be placed ! To the everlasting regret of music lovers who seek to pay homage at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 90 KONSTANZE I was poor ! Your brother left me ill provided for ! MOZART You approached no one ! Many would gladly have provided the money for a decent burial site . Including myself , and my late husband ! KONSTANZE Oh , really ? I could have approached you ? You , who , conscripted by your father , would not allow me a small trinket on our Salzburg visit . Not even when Wolfgang begged you to do so after hearing of the death of my child ! Asked you ? Approached you ? Do n't make me laugh ! MOZART And you ? Where are you to be buried ? KONSTANZE Beside my husband , of course . MOZART I presume that you mean Mr.Nissen ? Not of course , the pauper 's grave of your first husband , my brother . MOZART One more question . KONSTANZE Yes ? MOZART Your sisters are now living with you in Salzburg ? KONSTANZE Yes ? MOZART Will they too be buried in the same plot beside my father ? KONSTANZE Of course ! That has already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to be my father 's fate to lie beside the hated Weber women for all eternity ! KONSTANZE So it seems ! MOZART And you ! For all eternity you wish to rest beside my late father ? KONSTANZE That is correct . MOZART You hated each other ! KONSTANZE Because we recognized each other . MOZART What on earth can you possibly mean by that ridiculous remark ! KONSTANZE Ridiculous , you say ? MOZART Yes ! Ridiculous ! What was there to recognize ? KONSTANZE Do n't you see , my dear sister-in-law , that your dearly beloved father and I were very alike ? MOZART No ! I can not see that at all ! KONSTANZE You accuse me of being greedy for worldly goods ? MOZART Yes ! I do ! KONSTANZE You accuse me of exploiting others for my own gain ? MOZART Yes ! KONSTANZE And especially of exploiting the gifts of your brother ? To fatten my own purse ? p. 92 MOZART Yes , yes , and a hundred times yes ! KONSTANZE There then ! There you have the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question : how your father and I are alike . MOZART Go ! Leave my home at once ! May you rest beside my father in eternal hate ! Go ! At once ! Joseph ! Joseph ! Remove this odious woman from my home immediately ! KONSTANZE exits . Her laughter continues off stage MOZART ( paces in an extremely agitated manner , wringing her hands ) , and calls out desperately ) : Joseph ! Joseph ! Are you there , Joseph ? ( Adopts a listening manner ) . Oh yes ! I can hear you close by ! My eyesight continues to fail , so I can not see you too well . One blessing of my failing vision is that I could hardly see her ! Oh ! The things she said about my father ! My father ! My poor , dear father ! To lie beside that woman forever ! I hope and pray that death is truly the end of all knowing ! Joseph , I want you to find my will ! You know where I keep it ? Yes ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes , yes , of course We have spoken of it many times ! That has always been my dearest wish . You found the will ? Now , I want you to make arrangements to change my will . Yes , dear Joseph , to change my will ! Please note this down carefully : I no longer wish to be buried in the family plot ! No , no ! Do not try to dissuade me ! Yes , the decision is a most painful one ! But I can not , I will not be buried near that woman ! No ! Not even in the same cemetery ! Unlike my poor father who has no choice in the matter , I refuse to be doomed to rest beside that vile creature for all eternity ! No ! I prefer to be put to rest in a common grave . Like my brother before me.No , no , no , Joseph , my kind friend ! I will not change my mind ! Not give it any further thought ! I request that my earthly remains be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is absolutely final ! THE LIGHT IS REDUCED TO NEAR DARKNESS , AND REMAINS SO FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS . DURING THIS PERIOD NANNERL SLOWLY MOVES UP STAGE TO SEAT HERSELF AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL . p. 93 MOZART In my restricted ever-darkening world there has been one great moment of joy . The Novellos . Ivor and Mary have come all the way from England to visit me ! To personally deliver a gift from the music loving public in London ! A couple approaches : they hold out their hands in greeting . A young man accompanies them . MOZART ( addressing the couple ) : Oh , the stories I could tell about our triumphs in that city ! Had the archbishop not recalled us , I think we could have stayed forever ! You have come directly from visiting Konstanze ? ( Becomes extremely agitated ) Konstanze , Konstanze ? Is she here then ? No ! No ! I have no wish to see Konstanze ! No , no , do not apologize for the absence of my " dear sister-in-law " ! She sent her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He wished to come to visit his aunt ? He is the musical one , Franz Xavier ? But now known as Wolfgang . He changed his name himself , in honor of his father 's memory . MOZART ( stretches out her hand ) : He takes my hand in his . A small hand . A smooth hand . A hand like that of my little brother , all those years ago . For a long time I do not release his hand . By the feel of that hand , that familiar clasp , I now believe that this Wolfgang Mozart is indeed the son of my beloved brother.Remember , little brother , how close we were . You called me your Queen . I feel you near me . Remember , we made us a secret kingdom . A make believe kingdom . It was a land of music , and we ruled together . Always together in our secret world . Now I feel you nearby . So close . So close once more.And I stretch out my hand . I stretch out my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAND . ) And I say : Little brother , come , give me your hand . Give me your hand , little brother , to guide me on this long last Journey from which no traveler returns ! THE END .
