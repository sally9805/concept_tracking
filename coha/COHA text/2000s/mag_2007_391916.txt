Talk about a tough crowd . Americans have steadily lost confidence in their leaders since 2005  --  the year the government bungled its handling of Hurricane Katrina  --  according to the third annual Center for Public Leadership/ U.S. News poll conducted this fall . More than three quarters of the respondents say they believe the country is going through a leadership crisis , up 7 percent from last year , a trend stretching across all demographic and political groups . Nearly 80 percent feel that unless it gets better leaders , the country will decline , while 51 percent believe that the United States is already falling behind other nations . And about two thirds say that today 's leaders pale in comparison with those of 20 years ago . That 's a sobering critique , but given the dismal approval ratings of President Bush and Congress , these results are n't too surprising . " A lot of leaders are really impotent in changing the direction of things , " says Brown University Prof. Arnold Ludwig , author of a book on political leadership . He points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the Democrats ca n't stop the war , why they ca n't curb the president . Leaders are supposed to get things done . " Poll respondents certainly reflect that frustration . Only 9 percent say they have a great deal of confidence in Congress 's leadership . The executive branch fares somewhat better with 19 percent . Broad discontent . It 's not just political leaders who are failing in the eyes of citizens . Wall Street ties with Congress in its low ranking , followed by the media , which many consider tainted by bias . Fifty-two percent believe the media are too politically liberal , whereas 27 percent say they 're too conservative . But the press escaped coming in last . That distinction goes to the entertainment industry , despite  --  or perhaps because of  --  its growing visibility in politics . Tom Smith , director of the General Social Survey at the National Opinion Research Center , explains that shaky confidence often goes hand in hand with scandal . There 's been plenty , with " Plamegate " and Sen. Larry Craig 's restroom fiasco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public version of poor performance , " Smith says . So who earns the highest regard ? Overwhelmingly , it 's the nation 's military leaders : Forty percent of respondents say they have a great deal of confidence in those who lead the armed forces . There 's some encouraging news even for political and business leaders . With a traditional sense of American optimism , a majority of people  --  59 percent  --  believe the country will have better leaders 20 years down the road . Almost half hope 2008 will start that trend , many saying it matters a great deal who becomes the next president . Whoever that is will be facing a crowd hungry to see results . A Grim Assessment A majority of Americans believe the United States suffers from a leadership crisis . Nearly half think the country is on the wrong track ; more than half think it 's losing ground to other nations . Most find leaders worse now than in the past , although they have more faith in military leaders than those in any other sector . Percentage of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ...
