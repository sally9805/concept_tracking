Chapter One " TARGET AT ONE O'CLOCK . " Logan Montgomery listened to his eighty-yearold grandmother and groaned . " You 've been watching James Bond again , Gran . " " Just Sean Connery . That Pierce Brosnan is too new and the other one is a pansy . He would n't know how to please a real woman if she bit him on the - " " Gran ! " Startled , Logan shot a glance at his grandmother . An impish gleam lit her knowing gaze . She 'd learned to use shock value to her advantage , he thought wryly . " I think that 's enough . " " You never used to be a prude . " He stifled a laugh and chose to warn the irrepressible older woman instead . " And you never used to go so far . Better watch yourself . " The white-haired woman gave an unrefined , unladylike snort . " If you are n't careful you 'll end up a stuffed shirt like your father . " " With your influence ? Not a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tasting bubbles and little else . Damn waste of money . A cold beer would taste a hell of a lot better , especially on such an unusually hot and balmy May afternoon . " So tell me why you summoned me to the annual Garden Gala . " He 'd hoped he could ignore the formal invitation , hand-delivered to his house , as it had been hand-delivered to dozens of others . Although the Garden Gala was as much a part of Montgomery tradition as baseball was a part of spring , Logan did n't feel the same sense of anticipation for this event . His grandmother , Emma , was a different story . He adored her . " Because of her . " His grandmother waved a wrinkled finger in front of his eyes . " Over there by the Dogwood tree . She catered this whole party herself . Talent personified . " Logan narrowed his gaze . He could n't see much besides the overwhelming sea of floral prints on the female guests and the stark blackand-white uniforms worn by the help . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logan muttered . " I believe waiter or waitress is the politically correct term , " Emma said . " Could n't you get the judge to relax the dress code for God 's sake ? These poor people look like they 're attending a formal wedding , not serving cocktails on a spring day . " He liked parties as much as the next guy but this uptight excuse for a gathering was n't the way he 'd choose to spend a Saturday afternoon . " Your father has his standards , " Emma said in her haughtiest voice , in imitation of her son , Judge Montgomery . " He believes the help should dress as such . Ridiculous , " she muttered . " The man ought to come into the twenty-first century . Anyway , enough about Edgar for now . Look around . What else do you see ? " Logan took two steps to the right so he could see around a ridiculous-looking parasol held by one of his mother 's friends , to protect her skin from the nonexistent sun and impending rain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ribs . He looked once more and was rewarded by what he saw at the elaborate bar set up in front of the pool house , on the perfectly manicured lawn - a delectable-looking creature in uniform . She stepped around the bar and into full view . The clouds had begun rolling in but this woman radiated pure sunshine . Not even the standard waitress uniform looked ordinary on her supple curves . She reached over to clean the bar of used glasses , and Logan was treated to a backside view that was just as enticing . Black running shoes , obviously worn for comfort , and black tights with a vertical seam ran up the length of her well-toned legs . As she reached forward to sweep the top of the bar with a damp rag , the hem on her black miniskirt inched higher . He stepped closer in time to catch a hint of lace peeking beneath the black hem . Interest replaced curiosity and the temperature outside hitched up a notch . So did strategic body parts . He stuck one finger inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing room . She rose to her full height , which was n't much . Petite , with blond hair pinned on top of her head , she could n't have been more than five foot three . Considering he had one sister who had traipsed more friends through the house than he could count on both hands , Logan considered himself an expert on all things female . And this female intrigued him . His gaze traveled over her form-fitting white blouse , which was buttoned to her chin but failed to hide wellrounded breasts , lingered on the belt cinched over a small waist and settled on the white socks pulled over the sheer stockings . She was n't a typical waitress by any means . Did n't matter if he looked from the bottom up , or the top down , he liked what he saw . A smile edged the corners of his mouth . " Quit drooling and tell me what you see . " " A damn sexy penguin , " he muttered . " Call her what you want , " Emma said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did n't know I had any . " Another glance as she swung back around the bar and he grinned . If he had a problem , he sure would n't mind this woman being his solution . " Do you want to put an end to Montgomery expectations or do you want your parents and their big-money friends to keep hounding you to run for public office ? No peace , no quiet . And bye-bye low profile job at the public defender 's office . Once next Saturday is over , your life will be out of your hands . " ( Continues ... )
