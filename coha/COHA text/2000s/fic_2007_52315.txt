BOTH THINGS FIRST : Greta Steno is two places at once and walking . She is in a Chicago neighborhood in the early fall on a sidewalk made ramshackle by tree roots , and she is barefoot in Florida on a warm winter evening , the broad leaves of a banana tree swiping at her hair . She is thirty-nine and forty-two years old . In Chicago , she wears paint-spattered clothes and walks with her husband to the house of Ellen Riley , who is her closest friend and who is about to move to Florida . In Florida , she is in a tight black dress and walks beside Ellen , whose last name is no longer Riley , and they are on their way to a party . In Chicago , the late morning air still conjures the facade of summer , and Greta 's husband stumbles on the ragged sidewalk , falling to his knees . In Florida , Greta and Ellen drink scotch from transparent disposable cups , the winter dusk as warm as spring , Greta 's husband two years in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasties , " her husband says , examining the tear in the knee of his slacks . Duncan is slow finding his feet . The weight of middle age has settled in his trunk and limbs . He 's been awkward lately , wooden in his expressions . He 'd been a lanky boy in a rock band when Greta met him in college . Now their son has the gangly build , while Duncan 's body has become thick and ponderous . Their daughter , thankfully , looks like Greta . " It feels like they 're doing this to us " he says , getting up . " I know that 's silly . " He 's talking about the move . Ellens husband Theo has accepted a transfer . He is gone to Florida this weekend to look for a house . At the intersection , they can see the top of the great white oak , a landmark tree in a Chicago burg known for its trees . Ellen and Theo 's house was built in the 19205 , and the architect designed a notch in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous . Today its upper limbs tremble , and though neither Greta nor Duncan mention it , they understand the destruction has begun . In Florida , Greta talks about Duncan 's quick decline and death . She 's either drunk or acting drunk to hold Ellen 's attention . Ellen 's neighborhood is the kind of leafy habitat that encourages intoxication-tropical trees leaking oxygen like bad tires , houses rising out of the green abundance like pastel mushrooms . The banana tree that flounces its wide leaves over the sidewalk forces Greta to step to the curb . In one hand she holds her shoes-black mules with outrageous heelsand in the other , a plastic cup of scotch . " I got through it , " Greta is saying . She thinks perhaps she has gone on too long . " The kids got through it . " They 're not young women , Greta and Ellen , and neither are they old , beyond the childbearing pale but clinging bravely to the sheen of ripe sexuality . Ellen has changed her appearance since moving to Florida . Except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's severely tan and so thin as to teeter on that precipice of chic that overlooks serious illness . Her short hair stands in pointy reptilian barbs and is the blond of taco chips . She does n't look her age . She does n't look any age . Greta 's appearance has changed less . A wardrobe update and a smart new do that snakes about her head . She has dyed her hair , but only a lighter shade of the same midwestern brown . She 's prettier than Ellen , something that 's always been a factor in their friendship . Now that they 're single , it plays a larger part : It is her job tonight to get a specific man to Ellen 's house . Would she do such a thing for anyone but Ellen ? She ca n't quite believe she 's doing it at all , but Ellen wants them to be conspirators again , as they 'd once been when they had to wedge their husbands from the golf course or convince the children to visit a museum . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their roles are the same : conspirators , intimates , sisters . Greta is willing to do anything to get past this awkwardness . She mentions again the class she took . " The Greeks put friendship ahead of romantic love . They thought it a worthier topic . " She wants them to talk as they used to , and she 's pressing . " Whatever happened to those guys ? When was the last time somebody brought up Plato or Sophocles ? " " There 's a rapper in Miami who calls himself Euripides , " Ellen replies . " He spells it with a capital U : " U-Rippa-Deese . ' " " You ca n't possibly listen to rap . " " You 're reading the Greeks , of all things . Why ca n't I listen to rap ? " " I took a class . " It was actually Duncan who signed up for the course . Greta was there to operate the wheelchair and tape recorder . He had n't finished the semester , which meant she 'd had to quit , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read an article about that singer , " Ellen confesses . It 's finally dark , but a weightless sort of dark , as if they 're walking in the shadow of a transparency . Their destination is a house with a huge picture window . The room is brightly lit , and people skulk about in the light , drinking and displaying their clothes . A flagstone path warms Greta 's feet even though the sun has set and it 's supposed to be winter . Her feet like Florida . The remainder of her has qualms . Nothing about the landscape seems consequential : anorectic palm trees , golf carts driven on city streets , grown men in shorts and Pooh shirts . It 's hard for her to imagine anyone taking the place seriously . When Ellen met her at the airport , she whisked her off to a squat pink building where they rode stationary bikes and performed aerobics before an unrelenting wall of mirrors . The trip to the gym irked Greta and left her with sore legs . She sips the last of her scotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know all these people ? " " Put your shoes on , " Ellen replies . " I have lip liner . " She pats her purse . " Your mouth could use some definition . " " It 's that big hole in the middle of my face , " Greta says . " What more definition could it need ? " She sets the mules on the walk and steps into them . A couple of houses away , a sexy kind of fog-pleasant and billowy like a giant 's gentle exhalemakes moving shapes on the lawn . " There 's the hostess . " Ellen points . " She 's the consummate bitch ' . " A woman in a black dress spins away from a dark little man , a velvet V cutting her backside . She crosses the room with careful strides , as if she 's stepping on bodies . " I used to love drive-in movies , " Ellen goes on , indicating the window with her chin . " Hard to believe they 're gone . Half the women I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids still seem to manage , " Greta says . Unlike everything else she has seen in Florida , this show on its glass screen seems to have substance : adults dressed to the nines and drinking liquor from crystal tumblers , smoke churning from their mouths like the exhaust of internal combustion . " People here call me " Elle , ' " Ellen says . " You do n't have to . " " You changed your name ? " Ellen snatches the plastic cup from Greta 's hand . " New last name , new first name . " She tosses the cups in the shrubs . " She 's got a gardener . We 're not littering . " She does n't knock on the door but throws it open . The crane extends its black frame far above the great oak . Greta will not openly question Ellen 's character , but secretly she wonders whether this had to happen . The destruction of the tree has about it the feeling of expedience . Ellen is practical , and old trees have root systems that burrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a crack in the vast trunk , and the buyer withdrew his offer . The connection to the sale of the house troubles Greta . One crack hardly seems reason enough to fell this tree . The crane takes up most of the street and a good portion of the sky . " Wait here for me , " she says . " I know what you 're doing , " Duncan tells her . " They would n't cut it down if they did n't have to . " " I just want a minute . " The young man standing at the base of the tree sees her coming . He 's blond , thin , and vaguely unsettled . He 's a boy who never liked school but had relied on its routine . Without it he 's at loose ends , restless and lethargic at the same time . Today he 'll trim small limbs from the tree 's highest branches . " Watch for snakes , " his boss told him . The boy thought he was kidding . Snakes in Chicago ? They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Believe it , " his boss said . " They go after bird nests or they sun on the limbs . " What would his boss say about this woman approaching him ? Watch out for older women . She 's decades older than he is , but she 's pretty , and he likes the way she dresses-old clothes that do n't go together , in an interesting way . He decides he 'll have sex with her , given the chance , even if it costs him his job . This thought pleases him . He has now this decision , this solid thing around which to build his adult life . " Are you one of the tree men ? " she asks . The boy nods . He likes being called a man . He lifts a chainsaw to add to his manliness . He 's had the job all of three days , and he overslept this morning . He ca n't imagine doing something like this ( work , he means ) for the rest of his life . " Does it really have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what they 're saying , but is it dangerous or is that just an excuse ? " " I do n't in reality know trees . " He offers an uncommitted shrug . " I 'm not afraid of heights or a chainsaw . That 's how I got this job . " " I 'm not trying to interfere , " she assures him . Her hand touches his arm , a reassuring and flirtatious pressure . " I 'm just curious . " The touch makes him bold . " You do n't look old enough to own a tree like this . " She smiles at him , the hand on his arm suddenly warmer . " No one is old enough to own this tree , " she says . " That 's my point . But I 'm plenty old . " " A person would n't think so , " he says . " I 'm Aaron Jack . Friends call me A. J. ' " " I 'm Greta . " She starts to say more but his boss calls for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 've got to go , " A. J. says . He tips the chainsaw as a gesture of farewell . Where her hand held his arm remains warm , as if she 's passed on a fever . Once he 's strapped into the harness and among the high branches , he considers unbuttoning his shirt to examine the spot , see if its swollen . He 's clumsy in the harness , which is like a child 's swing with a seatbelt . Just lifting the chainsaw makes him twist in the air . Every time he thrusts the blade against a branch , he 's pushed backward . His tools , tethered by cords to the harness , knock against his feet . Hours pass , yet he 's still near the top of the tree when he spots Greta on the street . He wants to see where she goes . " A little higher , " he calls to the crane operator . She turns on Roosevelt Avenue and disappears , but he feels he can track her right through the obstructing houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does find her the next block over . The house she enters has a red tile roof . Greta , he repeats in his head . Red tile roof . Over the summer , A. J. went with his father to Disney World . The trip was sponsored by his father 's employer in recognition of twenty years " custodial work . A. J. and his father flew to Florida together . When they went to pick up the rental car , the agent asked for a credit card . His father did not have one and reminded her that the car was covered by the firm . But the agency required a damage deposit : five hundred dollars . His father counted out the cash . The hotel room was paid for , as were the passes for the amusement park , but they were left with little money for food and no money for anything else . They stuffed rolls from the complimentary breakfast into their pockets and snacked on them in Fantasyland . A few days after they returned , a breezy afternoon when his parents were away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping pills and swallowed a handful . He went to the back porch and waited to die . Instead of perishing , he threw up in his father s rose bushes . Dangling from a wire on another breezy afternoon-this one filled with the noise of the chainsaw-A . J. does n't know why he 'd felt he had to die . Something about the huge heads of the cartoon figures that had walked among them at Disney World , something about the muffin crumbs he could not get out of his pockets , the way his father nodded to the woman at the car rental as if he could dole out hundreds of dollars without thinking about it . A. J. is wondering about his feeble stab at suicide when he encounters the snake . By this time he has worked halfway down one side of the tree , clearing the branches for the more experienced men . He is aware of his fatigue , but only feels it when he sits still in his harness . The snake makes him still . The chainsaw idles in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body does n't wrap around the limb but curlicues over it . Its head is close to the trunk , and it twists back to stare at him . Its eyes are black and seem to be made of metal . He has the idea that the snake knows things he does n't , and that frightens him . Yet there are things he knows that a snake ca n't . Such as the purpose of a chainsaw . He revs it and takes a swipe at the snake 's body . It leaps at him . It seems to fly right off the branch . Only the circulating blades of the saw keep it from reaching him . A part of the snake falls , smacking into the branches below . A. J. does n't think to yell , and the men on the ground make noises . He is splattered with blood and does n't know what he ought to do . On the branch , half of the severed snake lies crookedly . The ruptured end lifts and pauses in midair , as if considering him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scream . Then it peels off the branch and falls through the network of limbs . Entering the party house , Greta thinks , Now I 'm one of the characters on the big screen . She is the wild friend from out of town . This is the role she and Ellen settled on . Gretas mother is watching her daughter for the weekend , her son is safely off to college , and Greta is a thousand miles from home-she may as well cut a wide swath . " My friend from the old country , " Ellen says , introducing her . The Temptations flare up in the next room : " I Ca n't Get Next to You . " Hidden among the glamorous throng are a few unattached middle-aged men . One by one they make their way across the floor to Greta . These are men who have been without women too long . Loneliness rounds their shoulders . Their shoes make swamp noises . Men without women wear ugly shoes , she has noticed . They are the opposite of the Temptations : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often laundered : dull and soft , transparent in places , of no use but to buff a car . Little wonder women are so often attracted to the husbands of friends . The Supremes take over the stereo arguing that love 's a game of give-and-take . Greta uses it in her chat . " Are n't you sick of these oldies ? " She touches the bulging shirt of the man she 's talking to , the soft expansion of his gut . " Diana Ross has a sweet voice , but she is n't Sylvia Plath or Zora Neale Hurston or , I do n't know . . . Euripides " She laughs . The man follows her lead-his laughter a gurgling chortle , as if he 's choking . She keeps going . " Her " work " does n't hold up to forty years of listening , do you think ? " The man 's head wobbles , unable to consider the question for the feminine hand pressing against his fabric . She moves her fingers over his belly to heighten the effect . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing she liked as a girl : it 's pleasing to have power over someone . Ellen signals with a jerk of her head . Andrew Holzman , the man she has targeted , has emerged from the adjoining room to get a drink at a bar set up in the corner . A young woman with a ponytail-hired help , evidently-cocks an ear in his direction . Andrew Holzman does not impress from a distance . Ordinary face , graying hair , pale eyes that might be made of ash . He 's missed a loop with his belt . But his shoes are presentable . That means something , Greta supposes . He has a cast over his wrist and thumb and up to the elbow of his right arm . It 's her task to invite him to Ellen 's house on one pretext or another . She can provoke a group to skinny-dip in Ellen 's pool . She can see if a handful wants to smoke pot . Ellen simply wishes for him to visit . Nothing has to happen . The cast , Greta realizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago at a neighborhood playground when they were both lugging small children . One invited the other to dinner , and they all-spouses and children included-hit it off . Their husbands jogged and golfed together . Their children held hands in preschool . Greta saw Ellen every day . They made excuses to go off together : to a spa , a cabin in the Upper Peninsula , even a hike in the Rockies . Greta had never had such a friend . Ellen taught her bridge , made her wear short dresses , drove her to the hospital when her daughter fell from a swing and went into convulsions . They cooked elaborate meals together-pheasant under glass , beef Wellington , souvlakia with homemade pita-and went door-to-door together , handing out pamphlets for a local candidate . From the beginning , each participated in the others thoughts . Once , after they 'd gone downtown with their husbands to see a Tennessee Williams play , Greta had tried to explain her disappointment with the production . " It 's like they were n't really acting , just talking , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They performed as if their characters were merely people " she 'd said . How terribly surprising and addictive it was to be understood . Then Theo accepted a transfer and Ellen was gone . Within a year of the move Theo and Ellen 's marriage fell apart . Greta followed the deterioration by phone . Theo slept with a company receptionist . Ellen had anxiety attacks . She went to bed with a man she met in a self-help class . Greta cant remember the man 's name , but the class was called " How to Take Charge of Your Life . " Duncans deterioration was going on during that same time . Greta 's stories were duller . " He ca n't tie his shoes , " she would say . " He ca n't button his shirt . " Duncan had his own ideas about Ellen and Theo 's move , but he refused to divulge them . The disease made him stubborn . " Here she is , " Ellen taps the shoulder of Andrew Holzman , " the one I 've told you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , but he holds a drink in the hand with the cast and a cracker smeared with cheese in the other . Greta bends down and takes a bite of the cracker . She raises her head at the same moment the girl with the ponytail passes along a drink . Liquor splashes over the front of Greta 's dress . " My fault , " Greta says , before the bartender can apologize . Andrew Holzman runs a finger over the damp spot on her dress , sticks the finger in his mouth . " My , " he says . " You 're delicious . " Duncan finds his wife in the study standing next to Ellen . They 're staring out the window , watching the tree men . He has spent the past few hours carrying dusty boxes down a narrow attic staircase . Even though he has washed his face , it 's pink from exertion . Sweat darkens his shirt . His back aches . The tear in his pants is rimmed with blood , like lipstick , and the wound bites at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the oak 's massive trunk to provide any perspective on what the men are doing . Leaves and small branches tumble down and settle among the roots . From the attic window , Duncan was able to watch a young man-a boy , really-suspended on a swing , trimming small limbs with a chainsaw . The kid did not inspire confidence , the saw jumping and growling in his hands like a dangerous pet . Down here the noise is not as loud but it 's fierce . Like being inside a hive and hearing all the worker bees . The room-the whole house-has an air of injury about it : furniture swathed in plastic wrap , rugs rolled and bound , bookcases gaping morosely . I 'm missing them in advance , he thinks . Darkened spots mark the walls , as if the photos that had hung there left bruises . He has fetched bottles of beer from the refrigerator . He needs to rest , and the beer will give him an excuse later for his fatigue . " Beverage break ? " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even noon . " Greta taps her watch . " If we start drinking now , we 'll never finish . " He shrugs . " We need to empty the fridge , do n't we ? " Ellen offers her hand . " We 've just been admiring the butts these young men possess , " she says , accepting a bottle . " I 've got one of those , too . " Duncan turns to display his evidence . The divide of his slacks is marked with sweat . " I 've been watching the trimming from above . " " You ca n't call it " trimming . ' " His wife takes a bottle . " It 's wholesale destruction . " " That tree would have crushed us , " Ellen says . " Do n't forget that . We 've been living quite literally in deaths shadow . " " That 's quite a feeling , " Duncan says , " is n't it ? " " I ca n't help thinking about the tree itself , " Greta says . " If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The tragedy would 've been not finding out , " Ellen insists . " Even if it had n't crushed us when it fell , it would have made a mess of our lives . " " All right , " Greta concedes , " but felling the tree is a tragedy , too . " " I know it is . " Ellen puts her arm around Greta . " Once it 's cut , I want you to come over and count the rings with me . " Greta softens immediately . " What am I going to do without you ? " The embracing women send a small erotic charge through Duncan 's weary body . He is the most familiar and least celebrated of romantic heroes : the man who loves his wife . " You finish the attic ? " Greta asks him . She wants him to walk home and fetch their station wagon . " Ellen 's giving us all these books , " she begins , but she reads his reaction accurately . " Or I can get the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind resting . " " I 'll go . " Greta sets the bottle on the window ledge . " Only take a minute . The beer wo n't even get warm . " She vanishes . The closing door creates an echo . Duncan decides to use the time with Ellen . He has something to tell her and something to ask . " I need to talk to you , " he says , " while we have some privacy . " " About anything in particular ? " " Something very particular . " " Cigarette ? " The back stoop is made of concrete and has a distinct slope . Duncan leans against its metal rail . The tree men have hauled in a trailer with wire mesh sides and are filling it with twigs , leaves , and limbs . In the shade of the house , the afternoon air is surprisingly cool . Duncan understands that autumn is really beginning . In the Midwest , seasons often change hands during a single day . It is the last day of summer and it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cold in the shade . He lights two Merits , passes one to Ellen . " I 've been to the doctor , " he says , " and a specialist . " He reveals his diagnosis . The symptoms are just starting to show . " Greta does n't know . I 've tried to tell her , but it 's harder than you might think . I do n't know what I should do . " " Take her dancing while you can , " Ellen says . She quickly adds , " Sorry . I should n't have put it that way . " The cold makes him shiver , and he thinks perhaps Ellen already knew . Theo must have told her . " However you put it , I wo n't be dancing long . " " Nothing pop , of course , " Ellen goes on , to cover her embarrassment . Her nose is turning red and beginning to run . She 's going to cry after all . " She prefers the blues . " The chainsaw sounds high above them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , people will remove their screens , and the ambitious ones will hoist storm windows . The birds will gather to discuss migration , and the animals that hibernate will move to their winter burrows . Duncan can tell from todays effort , he 'll have to hire someone to help him with the winter chores . The thought dismays him . " You and Theo will come ? " " Dancing ? " Ellen asks . She nods . " On one condition . " " What condition is that ? " " Do n't tell her until after . " " After the dancing ? " " Until after we 've moved . " She drops the cigarette and keeps her eyes on her shoe as she snuffs it . " Otherwise , I ca n't see myself going . " Duncan is surprised and baffled by this response . Inside , the front door noisily opens and shuts . Greta has already made the short walk to their house and driven back . " It might be easier on her , though , " he says softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easier at first , " Ellen replies . He can hear his wife crossing the living room and coming to the stoop . There 's no time to argue . " All right then . " He agrees to her terms . Greta joins them . She holds a book in her hand , a hardback novel . " How can you possibly give these up ? Are you certain ? " " They 're too heavy to move , " Ellen says . " Besides , I do n't plan to read in Florida . No one there reads . " Greta plucks her husbands cigarette from his mouth . " Are you crying ? " she asks . " Has it finally hit you how much you 'll miss us ? " " It 's just the cold , " Ellen says . " Thank god I 'm leaving it behind . " Dancing with Andrew Holzman has n't helped Gretas sore calves . She steps into the backyard of the party house to smoke in peace . She 's carrying her shoes again , which makes lighting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubling her . She hated their reflections , how their muscled torsos spoke not of youth or beauty or even health , but of something she can't-or wont-name . Men like the way Greta looks . She has known this all her life , and it 's still true . She 's gone out with several men since Duncan died . Contrary to the dire predictions about dating after forty , she 's had no trouble finding suitors . But her body in the gym 's mirror had seemed like the body she used to have in caricature . During a slow dance she convinced Andrew to come to Ellen 's later and smoke a joint . Getting him there by seducing him was not a strategy that would please Ellen , but Greta is confident she can pass him off at the house . A few years ago she and Ellen had made their husbands take them to a blues bar on Chicago 's south side . The men had quickly given out , but she and Ellen danced together until closing , talking the whole time , yelling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other so often without using up all their stories . The long-distance calls had been compelling as well , at first , until the gaps began . Greta repeated herself , caught herself exaggerating , occasionally outright lying . When they lived inside each other 's lives , they had no end of things to discuss and analyze , reconstruct and dismiss . Now she feels the need to entertain her friend . A giant palm dominates the yard , the squat kind with leaves like spikes . A figure steps from the tree 's complex shadows . A woman , Greta can tell , although she ca n't see her face . As she draws near , Greta recognizes her-the bartender with the ponytail . Before she can greet her , the girl says , " I know who you are . " She stops walking and crosses her arms . " I know what you 're doing . " " I 'm a friend of Ellen Riley " Greta says and corrects herself . " Elle Forsythe . " " That may be true , " the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Greta feels a quiver of fear and smokes to hide it . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " I knew it the second I saw you . " Her eyes are bloodshot , her face puffy . " You spilled that drink on purpose . " The girl 's eyes shift to one side and back , the most laconic dismissal Greta has ever witnessed . " I do n't know you , " Greta insists , " and I do n't know who you think I am . " " If you do n't want to consider her , fine . " She spits out the words . Real spittle strikes Greta 's cheek . " But what about me ? What about my brother ? " She takes another step and the porch light turns her face green . Greta drops her cigarette and grinds it in the dirt . The girl starts to rush past , but Greta puts out the hand with the shoes to make her stop . The girl backs away from the heels as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then offers her driver 's license . " I do n't live here , " she says . " You poured a drink on the wrong person . " The girl seizes the card and studies it . " OK , " she says reluctantly , " you 're not her . " Her tone is not apologetic . " But you 're exactly like her . You 're one of them " She tosses the license back . Greta snatches it out of the air as the girl rushes past and slams through the door , bumping Andrew Holzman as he pokes his cast through . " What 's her problem ? " " Mistaken identity , " Greta says casually , as if it happens to her all the time . She swings the shoes against her thigh , feeling drunk and sweaty , barefoot , scorned and sexy , as if she 's Bette Davis or Marlene Dietrich , a woman with intrigues and desires and a taste for trouble . She feels bold . " Are you married ? " " At the moment ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the lips . She tastes bourbon on his tongue . She slips her fingers inside the waistband of his gray slacks and whispers in his ear . " You do n't move for a second . Let me do this . " She unbuckles his belt and pulls it partway free . She slides her arms around his waist , puts her mouth to his ear . " You missed a loop . " On the front lawn they join Ellen and a few others , including the hostess , " the bitch , " whom Greta met briefly . Her name is Penny , and the straps of her black dress have slid down her shoulders , revealing the white of her breasts . The V in the back shows her panties . It 's a dress aching to come off . They begin the trek to Ellen 's house to the tune of " Hotel California , " sung by a stray man from the party . His voice has range but he lacks control , emoting through the song as if the lyrics have no meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each scene even though it makes the character incoherent . There have been times in her life when she felt conflicting urges : to behave in her best interest , to make the most of the moment . When they pass an elementary school with a colorful plastic slide and jungle gym , Greta recalls the playground at Euclid Square where she first met Ellen , where they watched kids and talked about their lives . Oh , how they had loved each other . Ellen strolls a few feet away , her arms wrapped around her thin torso , lost in calculation . Does she really want Andrew ? Something subterranean is guiding the evening ; Greta guesses it must be love . What does she want herself ? For Ellen to seduce him ? That will leave her with the bad singer or one of the other men . Sex with strangers often interests but rarely compels her . With Duncan , sex served an additional purpose . It reminded her who she was . It taught her who she loved . It fed the flimsy and hard-to-hold thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with strangers inevitably disappoints . It feels good some of the time , but it is momentary and meaningless , like any other workout . Penny continues to play hostess , even as they distance themselves from her house . " There used to be an estuary here . It 's underground now . Been that way for ages . But they left the bridge , a metal bridge that had gone over the water . It was here a long time . " " I remember that , " Andrew says . " I did n't grow up on this side of town , but I remember a bridge over nothing . " " It was only a foot or two off the ground once they filled in under it , " Penny continues . " The joke in high school was to jump off the bridge . How we dealt with heartbreak . " " Where was it ? " Greta asks . " You 're standing on it , toots . " Greta nods but does n't smile . She gives herself permission to dislike this woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The road shows no traces of the bridge . A streetlamp blanches their faces . Up the way , fog drifts across a yard , a simple oval , like a white hole in the fabric . During what turned out to be the final month of Duncan s life , Greta threatened to divorce him . He blamed it on Ellen . " You hear her talking about lovers and lawyers , and it sounds dramatic . " He wanted her to quit calling Ellen . Greta refused . She had brought up divorce after he signed a legal form to be put on a ventilator when the time came . It would operate his lungs , permitting him to live indefinitely . He would not be able to speak by that time . He would not be able to move more than an eyebrow . Greta took the children and went to her mother 's house . She does n't know whether she would have gone through with the divorce . Duncan wheeled his electric chair onto the back stoop and veered off the ramp . He suffocated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Andrew announces , indicating his cast . " I landed badly . " He has spoken softly , but everyone hears . " Were you trying to kill yourself ? " Greta asks . " My , my , " says Penny . " Are n't we direct . " " I was trying to kill something , " Andrew says . " Not me literally , it was only the second story . But I had to make a point . " A surprisingly complicated man , Greta thinks . Handsome , damaged , confuseda worthy companion . " Gretas no stranger to stunts , " Ellen says . " Ask about her divorce some time . " The others make noises to convey the sensation of being startled and enticed , a consensual apparition of emotion rather than the real thing . Greta , though , feels genuinely stunned . She does n't know what Ellen 's talking about . " Let 's do hear some divorce stunts , " Penny says . " Give us the down and dirty . " " I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce him . " I was n't a saint . No one would accuse me of being a saint . " " We do n't want whining , " Penny says . " Stunts . Exploits . Humiliating whatnot . " " We were happy , " Greta says . " Ellen can testify to that . " She will not describe the way Duncan 's body quit little by little , how it became a substance , a stone . The immovable object . How it repulsed her . Every moment of her day was concerned with that weight , its comfort , it functions , its awful greed . " When Ellen moved away , well ... " Andrew and Penny speak at the same time . He raises the cast to stop her . " Sometimes we need an outside party to keep the inside steady , like .. . " He tilts his face skyward . His head makes small jerking motions , as if he 's searching the constellations for words . " A voyeur , " Penny suggests . " Every family needs someone staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps you from seducing the mailman . " They laugh to let Andrew off the hook , but Greta does n't laugh and neither does Andrew . " She had a fling with a boy , " Ellen says , making her eyes wide . " They were upstairs while hubby was down ! " They have almost reached her house . She points to it , and her voice takes on the approximations of excitement . " Our destination : Florida 's official bacchanalia site-Elle 's Den of Inequity ! " Greta is too bewildered to move . She never had sex with any boy or man-not while Duncan was alive . Andrew hangs back with her . " Like a spoon , " he says at last , " in a cup of coffee , that keeps it from spilling over the rim . An outside person can do that . A spoon . That really works , you know . " " I know , " she says . The sudden affection she feels for him is troubling . She takes his arm . " We 're falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A. J. ca n't stop trembling . The men help him from the harness . He wants to describe the look the snake gave him and how it stared at him a second time after it was cut in two . It had a cruel face and then an awful , impossible face . There is no way to tell anyone this . They wrap him in a coarse blanket . They 're treating him as if he 's injured . Could this blood be his ? He touches his ribs as he walks , a man on either side of him . He pats the bloody places , feeling for wounds . They put him in the cab of the truck . He ca n't remember the name of his boss , who 's driving , talking about bathing and fresh clothes , taking a day off . They 're not going to the hospital , which tells A. J. he is n't hurt . It 's a long drive and no one is at his house when they arrive . His boss asks when his parents will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be home now and wonders whether they 're in the right house . On the end table is a picture of himself as a boy standing between his mother and father . No one else would have that . " You ought to get a shower , " his boss says . " You 've got blood on you . " After a moment , he adds , " I never should have put you in that harness . I have experienced men . They wanted to see how much they could slough off on you . " " It was OK , " A. J. says . " Get some clean clothes " his boss says . " Soak in hot water . I 'll wait out here . Go on . Wash off . " A. J. understands something is required of him . He heads down the hall to turn on the bathwater . In his bedroom he finds clothes . When he returns , his boss is by the front door talking on a cell phone . A. J. piles the fresh clothes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes , but he feels it 's his job to soak as his boss suggested , and is n't he a good guy to be so concerned ? All that happened was a snake . . . a snake in a tree . . . a snake he sawed in two . . . a snake looked at him and ruined his clothes . The bathwater turns pink with the snake 's blood . A surgeon could sew the snake back together . Doctors can do all these things now . They could get blood from other snakes to fill its body . But there 's no way to make it alive again . Which makes A. J. wonder what that means , to be alive . He dries off and dresses , discovering he took two pairs of pants from his room and no shirt . When he steps from the bathroom he finds his boss on a kitchen chair in the hallway , his cap in his hands . The cap is green . His name , A. J. recalls , is Tom Stewart . " You look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly for A. J. to hear . " Did you a world of good , I bet . " It occurs to A. J. that maybe he missed something in all the action . What else could have happened ? He says , " You did n't have to wait , Mr. Stewart . " " I owe your parents a word or two about what happened . " A. J. does n't know how to phrase the question he wants to ask . " I cut up a snake , " he says . " Did something else happen ? " Tom Stewart raises the hand with the hat , pauses , and then fits it onto his head . " No , son , " he says . " You did fine . " " That snake was alive , " A. J. says . " It makes me think how you cant put life back into something once it 's gone . " " That 's right , " his boss says . " That 's how it is . " He wants to describe the commotion inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake is the most important moment of his life . But how can that be true ? He was born , was n't he ? He 's had sex with two completely different girls . He won a drawing for a color television and sold it for two hundred dollars . He went to Disney World and tried to kill himself . How could sawing up a snake compare to any of that ? He realizes he himself was the one screaming . That makes the most sense . A snake , even if it is n't sawed in half , ca n't scream . That 's why his boss is here . To make sure the screaming and trembling is done . He ca n't decide whether his hands are shaking . It might just be his eyes . He says , " Why am I so . . . ? " " There 's no telling , " Tom Stewart tells him . " What scares us , we do n't have control over that . " " After I cut it in two , " A. J. says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say more , explain that the snake had a second and horrible face , but the door opens . The sun has all but set , and his father 's shadow across the carpet is gigantic . As soon as the joint is lit , Penny decides she must get back to her party . " I do n't require an escort , " she announces , a statement that demands a volunteer . " Grab Andrew , " Ellen whispers to Greta . " Let 's hold on to him . " As the joint is passed to Andrew on the couch , Greta intercepts and sits on his lap . She inhales to make the lit end glow . The one who sang " Hotel California " offers to walk Penny . The Talking Heads sing through the speakers . A slight chronological advancement from Motown , Greta thinks , as she rises from Andrews lap . By the end of the album the joint is gone , and all but four have returned to Penny 's party . Besides herself , Ellen , and Andrew , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot is not so potent that she fails to see her duty . She kicks off her shoes and traipses over to his chair . She sits on one of the wide arms and puts her bare feet on his knees . " Hey , sport , " she says . " I 've forgotten your name . " He has a serious face with intense black eyes . " We were never introduced . " " I 'm Greta , like the immortal Garbo . " " Not too often I meet an immortal , " he says . " You 're only the second . " She laughs at that . " Tell me something about yourself . " He bends his finger . She obediently leans in . " I 'm in love with your friend . " He points . On the couch , Ellen and Andrew use a mechanical device to roll another joint . " Which one ? " " Hah , " he says without any humor . " Your sister . This whole evening is for my benefit . I 'm supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Ellen tucks cigarette paper in its vinyl saddle . They look intimate already . Greta says , " Sorry . But I do n't think so . " " Oh ? " His eyebrows rise , and the pouches beneath his eyes vanish . He looks a decade younger . " Watch this . " He runs his hand along her leg and under her dress . " Hey now , " she says . At the same moment , Ellen says , " I know , " and hops up from the couch , spilling pot over Andrew 's lap . " Let 's move the furniture and dance . " A. J. pedals his bicycle to the house where the tree is coming down . He has stayed home from work two days , and it has taken most of the morning to ride from his neighborhood , which has few trees and no snakes . He watches from a distance . He does n't want the crew to see him . All of the branches have been removed from the tree . The top of the trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall-and bare now , like a single monstrous thought . He pedals farther , to the house with the red tile roof . A station wagon fills the driveway . The house is brick-nothing any bad wolf could blow down . It would take something huge , as big as the tree , to knock it over . The sprinklers are on , and a man is on his knees in the wet grass getting soaked . " Can you help me ? " he asks . He 's trying to turn off the sprinklers . A. J. gives the spiked knob a twist . It 's not really that tight . The man is effusive . He drips on A. J. 's shoes . " Are you handy ? " he asks . His name is Duncan , and he offers work . " A few hours a week . " A. J. starts immediately , hauling trash to the curb , mowing the back lawn , raking leaves in the wet grass . He is not quite finished with the leaves when Duncan tells him that 's enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want them to see you . " A. J. does n't know how to take this . " They do n't know how weak I am , " Duncan explains . " I do n't want them to know . Not until they have to . The children . . . " He loses his voice . His face changes shape . He searches the grass , as if his voice has fallen there . A. J. imagines what the voice might look like . In the raked pile , a jagged red leaf turns away from his gaze . Finally Duncan says , " Once they know their father is dying , their childhoods over , you see ? " These words do n't just strike A. J. 's ears but take to the sky , which pales and wobbles . He swallows an uncomfortable gulp of air . All he says is , " Sure . " Duncan pats him on the back . " How are you at carpentry ? " He describes ramps for a wheelchair . " I want to have them ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow , Duncan gives him a set of keys to the station wagon . They shop together for plywood and two-by-fours , which they take to a neighbor 's garage . Duncan is a patient teacher . He brings A. J. iced tea and makes him wear protective goggles . He does n't mind when A. J. confuses measurements or makes a cut so ugly it has to be redone . A. J. learns to maneuver a circular saw . He hammers nails , drives screws . He builds two ramps . They go together in sections . He paints them a brick color to match the house . When he shakes Duncan 's hand , it does not feel like a hand but a soft bag holding something lighter than bones : pretzels or Pixy Stix . He thinks he will finally see Greta when he installs the ramps , but Duncan is taking his family out of town . " Are you good with this ? " he asks . " Should I hire someone to help you ? " A. J. declines the offer . The sections fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy . He has retrieved these blocks from his closet and built a house much like Duncan 's , adding plastic ramps to the steps . " Keep track of your time , " Duncan tells him . A. J. spends the morning loading the sections into the back of the station wagon and unloading them down the street . The sections are heavy and difficult to maneuver . One set is for the front , another for the back . He has visited this house to clean the gutters , shovel snow , put up storm windows . He has never seen any of the family but Duncan , yet he feels connected to the place-the shape of the lawn , the rumpled roots of the sycamore in the backyard , the handprints in the sidewalk out front . These shapes and sights put him at ease , but the sections of the ramp fail to align . A. J. drives to a pay phone to call his father . When he gets no answer , he calls Tom Stewart . " I 'm not much of a carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out the problem . A. J. confused a section meant for the back with one meant for the front . A simple problem , but he has nailed the sections together . It becomes a complicated setback . They do not finish until after dark , and then admire their work by flashlight . " These are well built , " Tom Stewart says , kneeling to knock on the lumber . " The guy they 're for designed them , " A. J. says . " I just followed directions , and I messed up a lot even then . " " That 's all right , " Tom Stewart says . " These are good ramps , and you built them . " " I guess I did build them , " A. J. says , surprised somehow by this information . Headlights appear on the street and pull up to the driveway . " They 're not supposed to see me , " A. J. says . They climb into Tom Stewart 's truck and drive away . Greta and Andrew Holzman are stationed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't you give me your number ? " " I 'm staying here , " she says . " But I only have the weekend , and I want to spend it with Ellen . Then I 'll be in cold , cold Illinois , while you 'll be in warm , warm Florida . " The door is open , which lets in the smell of the outside world : grass and trees and the soft soporific southern air . The night is fully dark now , and she is tired . He says , " hot and cold do n't mix ? " " They become something terribly bland , " she says , " or a tornado . " He places his hands on her hips . She leans in and lets him kiss her . It carries a tiny charge . She glances at Ellen , who is slow dancing with the dark little man . " Did you know about those two ? " she asks . Andrew nods . " Elle tells me everything . " Greta 's understanding of the night is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner . She initiates a second kiss and lets Andrew press his body against hers . " I could be persuaded to stay . " He wags the hand with the cast . " This does n't prevent me from doing anything . " " What do you know that I do n't ? " she asks . " You can start with that guy 's name . " " It 's Stan . He 's in the process of leaving his wife . She was at the party . Maybe tonight was it-you know , the parting . " " That girl who was the bartender- " " Stan 's daughter . " " Jesus " Greta says . " I thought Ellen was after you . " " Me ? " Andrew makes a face . " Did n't you wonder why Penny left her own party to come here ? The wife is her best friend . " This talk makes her dizzy . She clings to him while she works to fit the pieces together . Penny hired Stan 's daughter to tend the bar , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Greta understands that she misjudged Penny . She left the party to stop Stan from seeing Ellen , to shame him . The night makes sense , just not the kind of sense she expected . It 's Penny and the little man 's wife who are friends , not she and Ellen . " I 'm trying like hell to get your attention , " Andrew says . " What do I need to do ? " " Love me , " she answers . " Give up Florida and move to Chicago . Buy snow boots and earmuffs . Live for me and me alone . " " Hmm , " he says . " You asked . " " What the hell . Let 's do it . " She expects him to laugh but he does n't . " You 're almost serious . " " I turn fifty next month . " He looks at his watch as if it keeps track of his age . " I was married once , but that was done with years ago . And you look like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of town . " " When I jumped out the window , it was at my daughter 's house , " he says . " She has a drug problem . I had to let her know what she was doing to all of us . " " A stunt , " Greta says , and it sounds like self-accusation . She realizes why Ellen said she was no stranger to stunts . All those things she invented on the phone to prolong their friendship . She mentioned a boy-one of the tree men-who began appearing on her street , staring from his bicycle at their house . She had the vanity to think he was there to catch a glimpse of her , but she discovered a canceled check to " A. Jack " written in Duncan 's nearly illegible hand . Duncan was using him to do the chores he could no longer do himself . The kid had built the ramps she has yet to remove . Then Greta used the boy , too . She 'd only told Ellen that she kissed him , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling such a lie . " I left my husband when he was dying , " she tells Andrew . " I left him because he had chosen not to die , and I could n't face it . When there seemed no end to it , I could n't continue . " Andrew nods without comment . He has no interest in judging her . He behaves as if the person she 's describing no longer exists , as if by admitting her bad behavior she erases it . She knows this is not true . All of the people she has been do not merely trail her like a wedding train but envelop her like the layers of an elaborate gown she can never entirely shed . The player changes discs . Motown is back . Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell have tracked her down . " Ai n't no mountain high enough , " they claim . " Ai n't no valley low ... " " I 'm so weary of this music . Why ca n't we take the pledge and move on ? " " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Ellen . She and Stan join them at the door . They 're holding hands . He wipes at his nose with his sleeve . " I 'll take the pledge , " Ellen says , as she marches to the stereo . The music dies . " Open the door , " she calls , but it 's already open . They step aside and she flings the CD , Frisbee style , into the yard . The silver disc catches the moonlight as it flies across the short stretch of grass , gleaming as it strikes a parked car . The door to the car opens . The dome light illuminates the girl with the ponytail who tended bar . Beside her sits another woman . " I have to go , " Stan says . " Close it , " Greta says , as soon as Stan passes through . " Do n't watch . " Duncan takes Greta dancing , as Ellen advised . Ellen and Theo come along , as Ellen promised . Except for the stage , where a band is immersed in golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with his wife on the crowded dance floor . He is worried that he will fall and give away his condition , and yet he 's enjoying himself . Greta used to make fun of his dancing when they were dating . " How can a musician have no rhythm ? " she 'd say . The memory adds to his pleasure . He loves the way his wife dances , the large and fine movements of her body , even her mouth , puckering and grimacing with the beat . He stomps a little to make his awkward shuffle seem intentional , but it makes him unstable . Greta bumps him as she does a spin , and his body tips like a great timber . Yet he does n't fall . Theo and Ellen have been dancing beside them all night . Theo 's hands grip him , balance him , and let him go . Greta does n't see a thing . He understands he will not dance again . This is his last night for dancing . When the song ends , Theo pretends to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , " Theo says . " We want to drink . " Theo was the first to know . He noticed something in Duncan 's golf swing , convinced him to see a doctor . Probably he told Ellen right away . What else would explain her reaction at the house ? It can be hard not to tell your wife everything . Immediately he amends the thought . Some things are easier not to say . They sit beside each other at the table , drinking and watching their wives . When the band announces their last number , Duncan is drunk enough to ask . He takes Theo by the arm . " When did you tell Ellen about me ? " Theo sighs and shakes his head wearily . " I ca n't keep a damn thing from her . " Duncan smiles , nods . He has another question . It coils in his mouth , ready to spring out . The transfer to Florida was so abrupt , their decision to move such a surprise . He thinks it 's his illness that made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to research the disease , how it dominates the lives around it , all the work it takes to care for a human who can no longer move . Families fall apart . Friendships dissolve . He holds on to Theo 's arm , but he does not speak . To ask is to accuse . He prefers to believe in their friendship . He takes a long drink of beer and searches the dance floor again for his wife . He 's determined not to let his illness destroy his family . Already he 's hired a kid to do chores , build ramps . The beer is still cold and just bitter enough . His wife dances into view . She 's talking with Ellen even as they flit and shake to the music . His life swirls deliciously inside him , like the smoke in the stage lights . He merely has to keep one step ahead of the disease . That 's all . How hard can that be ? On the day of Greta 's return flight , the Florida sky opens and rain pummels Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither wants her to be late . Ellen drives incautiously , skating over street ponds , passing on the freeway ramp . But traffic grows thick and they come to a standstill . " There must be an accident , " Ellen says . " It was smart to leave early , " Greta agrees . Since the party , Ellen has had nothing to do with her . She stayed in bed on Saturday morning , claiming a hangover . Yet when Greta got out of the shower , she was gone . A note explained that she was at the gym . She did n't return until lunchtime and arrived with friends . She announced in front of the others that Andrew had invited Greta to dinner . " I accepted for you , " she said casually . Greta took the hint . She had dinner with Andrew and spent the night at his apartment . A siren sounds . A patrol car passes them on the shoulder . " Andrew is really taken with you , " Ellen says . " He 's nice , " Greta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles in the bedroom . The sex was n't entirely satisfactory , but she enjoyed seeing his apartment . She asked him why Ellen wanted to hurt her , but he did not attempt an answer . She told him about Duncan , how he 'd had rages near the end , accusing her of intentionally hurting him when she got him dressed or took him to the toilet . They went to a counselor , but they could not make the therapist understand how they felt . He used words like " codependency " and " enabling , " feeble words that did no justice to the tragedy of their lives . Greta had wished Ellen and Tho could be with them . Why should n't friends go to therapy to save their happiness ? But she can not imagine sitting with Ellen and talking to a therapist . Instead , she sees them in Chicago with their husbands and children , bundled for winter , chatting about their lives . When the reverberation of the siren dies out , there 's only the sound of the rain . Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . " Her voice is soft , almost apologetic . She grips the steering wheel with both hands , her knuckles turning white . " How many more chances will I have ? " " I 'm not judging you , " Greta says . " You met him . You could see it . He 's a cut above . " As far as Greta could tell , Stan was as ordinary as they came . " People die for love , " Ellen says . " They fight wars for love . So what if I 'm willing to break up a marriage for it ? " " Why did n't you just tell me ? Why the big story about Andrew ? " " You made out all right there , " Ellen says . " You wound up pretty entertained by that little ruse . " " Oh , please stop . " They sit in silence . Ellen turns on the radio . An oldies station , the Turtles : " I ca n't see me loviri nobody but- " Greta switches it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I could n't risk it . I could n't have you throwing yourself at him . " " Goddamn you , " Greta says . " I hate you , you know . I really do . " One evening near the end of Duncan 's truncated life , he lets it slip that he told Ellen first . Maybe he means to hurt Greta with it . Maybe he wants to turn her against her friend . " She would n't let me tell you until she 'd gone south . " He 's hard to understand , his mouth no longer fully under his control , the muscles in his body burning out one at a time . The disease encourages them to be petty , to attend to minutiae , anything to avoid the havoc of misfiring nerves , the husk of his body . It does n't help that their sleep is ruined . Greta has to get up if he needs to pee or merely turn on his side . She has to feed him and watch him chew . Twice a day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stomach . He says , " She told me to take you out while I could still dance . " Greta feels a wide sea of responses . She understands her friend has perhaps betrayed her . She understands her husband is looking for a fight . But this day she does not get angry . This day something else prevails . She says , " You could never dance . " He lets out a laugh . He no longer has the fine muscles to produce a smile , but he offers the skeletons gape . " Do n't I know it , " he says . " But this is ridiculous . " It 's a rare sweet moment , but Greta ca n't seem to convey that in the telling . Describing it to Ellen , she claims they danced , woman and wheelchair , about the cluttered house , knocking over a TV tray , Greta performing an unlikely striptease , her body undulating like a serpent 's . She claims they had sex in the living room . ( Duncan still could have erections all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not muscle , evidently , but some more resilient force . ) She describes to Ellen the cold arms of the wheelchair against her thighs , how she pressed his grinning face to her breasts . In reality , they just touch hands . He wants to hear one of the tapes from his class . She finds the cassette . The lecture is on the beautiful and mortal Medusa and her immortal sisters , who were so spectacularly ugly they could turn a man to stone . During the actual class , when Greta recorded the lecture , Duncan had asked a question . She remembers holding his hand aloft for him . He had wanted to know what became of the immortal sisters after the mortal one was slain . What did they do for the remainder of eternity ? The teacher had not come up with a good answer , although Greta ca n't recall exactly what he said . On the tape , he talks about the notion of some scholars that the hideous faces of the Gorgons were representations of female genitalia . That had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter on the tape . Nothing about the female anatomy-about her body , anyway-was ugly to him . She puts her hand on his chest , ready to direct the afternoon toward sex after all , but he has fallen asleep in his chair . She clicks off the tape , noticing the creases in the carpet left by the wheelchair , a long path from where he sits to the opposite end of the living room , branching off to the bedroom in one direction , the bathroom in the other , a heavy crisscrossing foliate crown . She gets out the vacuum to erase it all . Greta is in a Florida airport during a rainstorm when she is wakened in her Chicago bed by the thunder of a sledgehammer . She is in Florida and she is home from Florida . She is two places at once , and she needs a drink . In Chicago , her pajama tee is damp with sweat . The new season has begun and the morning is warm . She changes into one of Duncans white shirts . She has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the bartender s attention . The bar has a view of the airstrip and an assortment of junk on the walls-old oars and snowshoes , rusty signs for Esso oil and RC Cola . She does n't care for the decor , but the weather has shelved her flight . She has time to kill . She is home and her home is changing shape . She is stranded far from home and the distance she wishes to travel is growing . Her mother and daughter have ravaged the newspaper , and the coffeemaker holds a simmering carafe of her mother 's watery brew . She ca n't bear her mother 's coffee without a shot of Baileys . She searches for the bottle in the liquor cabinet . The men dismantling the wooden ramps have finished out front and appear now on the back stoop , two young guys in jeans . They sweat just beyond the kitchen window . Now and again they peek in at her . The bartender leans in her direction . " What 'll do you ? " She orders a gin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mighty . A powerful drink , please . " " I 'll make it as strong as you can take it , " she replies , a young woman in an ugly green vest . Greta can not stop thinking about the disastrous visit-the gym , the party , the whole ugly mess . She backs up to their life in Chicago , their long friendship , the parting . They had been like family . Gretas mother fills the kitchen doorway , saying , " Sleeping Beauty rises . " The tone is disapproving . She wears a floral dressing gown , a garish and threadbare garment the kids gave her one Christmas , a display of fidelity wasted on Gretas daughter , and if her son were home , it would be wasted on him , as well . Her children are sweet but inattentive and self-absorbed like almost everyone their age . " So ? " her mother says . " Did you have yourself a time ? " Greta shrugs as she grabs the Bailey 's . " It was pleasant . " Her date the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . They ate dinner in the Palmer House ballroom . The occasion included a jazz band and speeches by politicians and actors-a fundraiser for an obscure malady . Afterward they had drinks and sex and a drive in his convertible . With her mother at the house , Greta could have spent the night with him . She had no responsibilities calling her home , and she 'd been only mildly bored-a gentle , yielding brand of boredom she was coming to appreciate . She chooses a cup for her coffee and Irish cream , and tells her mother about the celebrities in the audience , their clothing , the courses of food , the alderman who shared their table . She enjoys the night more in retrospect than she had while she lived it . " Hair of the dog ? " her mother asks , eyeing the bottle . Greta finishes pouring the Bailey 's . " You can call it that . " The back door opens . One of the workers nods a greeting , taking in her bare legs . He holds a sledgehammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thought I ought to warn you . " He offers an abbreviated wave , two fingers flicking . Lightning divides the sky over the runway . Greta observes it through the bar 's wide window , a brilliant forking flash , followed by a tremendous percussive slap . The lights shut down . The room turns the gray of the sky . The girl in the vest rolls her eyes as she gives Greta the drink . " This always happens . The control tower has a generator . There are emergency lights in the halls . " " The bars are on their own ? " Greta asks . " You got it . " The tonic is flat ; she barely tastes the gin . But she 's happy for the dim room , the quiet , the time to think . The bond she shared with Ellen was physical , a belief in the bodies of children and men , a faith that resided in their own flesh . She can not keep her friend without her family . For that matter , Ellen could not keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come together in a complex harmony , and now they ca n't help but attend to everything that is missing . Is there a word for this kind of loss ? She 's acquainted with the grief of losing her husband , the shame of deciding to leave him , the guilt from knowing how he died . What 's the word for losing a dear friend ? She tries to find one with the right sound and texture . She can almost feel it on her tongue . A man on the next stool speaks to her : " Buy you a drink ? " She had n't noticed him , though he 's in a pilots uniform . His cap is on the bar , and he 's touching the emblem , white wings , with his thumb , as if to wipe it clean . His eyes are appraising and curious . Smiling , he adds , " I get a discount . " She declines his offer . " I just want to be left alone . " " There 's a wish , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifts her G &T; to keep it from spilling . The transparent liquid rocks in its transparent container . One of the men dismantling the ramps-the same one as before-pushes open the door again . She has moved her chair into the sun , her feet up on the windowsill , and the door nudges her chair . " Sorry , " he says , his eyes steering themselves along her legs to her thighs . The second man wedges his face into the space between the jamb and the door . The two heads in the opening look connected , like a mythological creature . " Something wrong ? " she asks . She removes her feet from the window ledge and the men enter . They want water . Greta fetches cups and ice . It 's only when she 's handing over the drinks that she realizes one of them is a woman-hipless and flat-chested , but undeniably female . She is silent while the man talks about the assembly and heft of the ramps , theirsturdy design , the clever interlocking parts . " They 're impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " My husband was an architect , " Greta tells him , but she can not explain why the pieces are nailed together so haphazardly they have to be sledged apart . " I 'd have removed them earlier , but my son used to skateboard on them . He 's in college now . " " You have a son in college ? " he says . Even as she smiles , she recognizes the tedium she felt the night before . It seems this will be the dominant feeling in her life , this somewhat gratifying monotony , like a boring song played especially for her . " I guess we ought to get back to it , " he says . The woman never says a word . The pounding resumes . Her mother has abdicated the kitchen . Her daughter is upstairs in her room , supposedly conjugating French verbs . Greta experiences a vague sense of desolation and gloom despite the brilliant sun on her skin . She does n't let it affect her too much . The coffee is bad , even with liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fret about ? Some feelings exist to be ignored . Just beyond her window , the man and woman examine a crowbar . They are siblings , she decides . She wonders whether they noticed the gouges where Duncan 's wheelchair skated off the ramp . Meanwhile , out front , a car slows as it approaches . A. J. drives by the house every weekend . He 's in college now and barely passing his classes , but he likes the campus , the grass , the paths between buildings . He feels better about the course work from week to week . He can almost see himself as a college student . He can almost see himself as something he already is . On his way over he drove past the house where the great tree had stood . He can not count the times he has seen the snake in his dreams . It does n't bother him now as it used to . It bothers him in a new way . Which must be a kind of progress , he reasons . The sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . They 're stacked on the driveway . A. J. understands that Duncan is dead . He would like to take those sections of the ramp home . There must be a use for the lumber . He does n't want to see it wasted . This is the reason he gives himself for parking the car and walking to the front door of Greta 's house . In the dim airport bar she pulls again at the thread of her reasoning . What she comes up with makes sense to her , even if she can not find the right label for it . When she and Ellen are together now , they feel diminished and nostalgic , like the members of any group who regret their solo careers . And that is what 's left for each of them now : a solo career . Greta 's husband is dead ; her son is in college , her daughter will soon follow . She 'll have friends , but none like Ellen . She 'll see men-maybe she 'll marry one-but none will have the presence in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her life is thinning , tapering . She takes up no space in the world , so light that the slightest breeze will stir her . Even grief will give up its hold , and she will be like the children who mocked their sorrow by jumping from the bridge that spanned nothing at all . Thinking this through does not make her happy , and yet she is pleased to figure it out . She would like to tell someone about it . A long mirror backs the bar . People hunch over their drinks . Strangers stuck in a terminal , everyone waiting to be somewhere else . There is no one here for her to talk to . It is Greta 's mother who answers the door , but A. J. does n't know this . She is a woman who looks like Greta but far older than he remembers . Time , he understands , is tricky . You think it runs downhill like water , like a great wide river . But time is no river . It shoots up from a central source , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that fork and fork again , and you find yourself almost grown one moment and a child at the same time . The minute he spent with the snake seems like less than yesterday , and the hours he worked as Duncan 's hands seem now ages ago . The woman is waiting for a response , but he did n't hear the question . " Oh , I know who you 're looking for , " she says . She leaves him on the doorstep . Time is not a river , he thinks . Time is a tree . Branches , roots , limbs , the leafing . Time defoliates . Time buds . Time cracks . He does n't know what he means . Yet he believes it . Greta finishes her drink and orders another . " Stronger , please , " she says . " You 're the boss . " The girl in the green vest looks a little like the bartender at the party who drenched Greta 's blouse . Maybe she would listen . There should be some way to advise this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which is what ? That friendships end ? That love dissipates ? That people die ? That there is nothing to trust in this uncertain life ? Happiness , love , friendship , even one 's own body : All the enduring bonds finally can not endure . Nothing is secure . Nothing keeps . What is the good of knowing that ? The bartender sets a glass of ice before Greta and pours from a bottle of gin . She says , " Tell me " whoa . ' " Greta feels the blood rush to her face . " Yes , " she says , " that 's it . " The girl stops pouring . Greta nods . The bartender has it right . " Woe , " Greta agrees . " Woe . " The person who comes to the door is Greta 's daughter , who is seventeen , who is Greta all over again , brand new . " Do I know you ? " she asks . A. J. 's world is tumbling-branches , roots , limbs , leaves , rings of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the way she asks , he knows she wants him to be all right . " I built those ramps for your dad , " he says . " Oh . " Not just her face but her whole person softens . " My mom 's getting rid of them . " " He 's dead then , I guess ? " She does n't react for a moment . " My dad ? " She nods . This confirmation does not sadden him as much as he expected . He 's not just in the doorway with this girl ; he 's at the base of the great tree and across the street from a beautiful woman who is walking his way . He is the boy he used to be and the man he is about to become . He says , " I do n't know why I 'm here . " A spot on his arm grows warm . Unexpectedly he adds , " You must think I 'm a jackass . " Her face opens now , and A. J. senses a world there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How well did you know him ? " and " Do you want to come in ? " She is not merely holding the door for a stranger ; she 's holding it for her father , she 's opening it to a future she can sense and almost see . A thousand moments from her life crowd into this one . She feels their rush . Until this point , she never imagined that life could be so rich .
