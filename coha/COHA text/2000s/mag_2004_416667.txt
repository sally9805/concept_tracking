Sometimes smaller is better . When Revenge Yachts President Jonathan Sadowsky first started building custom carbon-fiber boats in the late ' 80s , the result was large bluewater battlewagons like the 55-foot Cookie Too and Revenge 58 . These boats are still with their original ( and satisfied ) owners , and still raising tuna and blue marlin off Cape Cod , Mass. , and St. Thomas , U.S.V.I. , respectively . But when Sadowsky decided to shift focus recently and introduce a midsize , production-built center console , he topped even his earlier successes . His latest creation , the Revenge 35 Light Tackle ( LT ) , is the quintessential outboard fishboat  --  and a winner of a 2004 Motor Boating Editors ' Choice Award ( see the February issue ) . " The 35 Light Tackle is a high-end center console that 's designed to be bulletproof and user-friendly , " Sadowsky told me as we idled in the St. Lucie River near Stuart , Fla . " You ca n't get this anywhere else . It 's the only production-built , epoxy pre-preg impregnated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America 's Cup . " The construction of the 35 is definitely unique . The epoxy/gel coat fusion process , for example , is a proprietary procedure that is known by only three company insiders . Sadowsky uses a specialized , three-dimensional , solid modeling computer program to design each boat beforehand . That exact detailing , in conjunction with computer-controlled milling machines , provides a precise fit of the individual parts . The components themselves are built with fiberglass composites and Kevlar fabrics that are pre-impregnated with epoxy resin and kept frozen until needed . Epoxy is used instead of polyester resin because it shrinks less , is 600 percent stronger and cures very slowly . Each part is vacuum-bagged to fuse the materials together and fully remove voids . Finally , the molds are baked in a 4,000-cubic-foot oven at 250 degrees to cure . The computer-generated design of this boat offers another advantage  --  a high performance hull that 's not only strong and light , but also designed to give a feather-soft ride . The non-warped , progressive deadrise bottom starts at 23 degrees at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maximum of 45 degrees before sweeping up to the bow . The result is the softest ride of any boat I 've been aboard in this class . We ran at 36 mph in the confused five-footers outside the inlet , and I was never body-slammed coming off a wave . Top-end speed is n't sacrificed for this incredible ride . A fouled spark plug on one of the 250-hp Mercury OptiMax XS motors caused it to perform less than perfect during our test , but we still made 50.3 mph with 300 gallons of fuel and 110 gallons of water on board . With the same load , maximum speed is typically 54 mph , according to Sadowsky . At a cruising speed of 36.7 mph ( 4500 rpm ) , the 35 LT 's range is 508 nautical miles with a 10-percent fuel reserve . If that 's not enough coverage , a 550-gallon fuel capacity is an option for $3,450 ( 425 gallons is standard ) . I also was impressed by how the boat handled . It tracked like a laser , especially during about-face turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest wallow or slide . Helm visibility was excellent . Thoroughbred performance aside , this boat sets a new benchmark for center console fishability . Sadowsky , who honed his angling skills with some of the best big-game crews in the world , feels that healthy live bait is the most important aspect in tournament competition . Because of that , the pump system on this boat is state of the art . The main 120-gallon live well in the deck has two stainless steel 1,800-gph pumps with 50-psi outflow ( one active and one backup ) . It can be pressurized to keep baits from banging around while under way . Four more identical pumps supply water to the twin 18-gallon transom feeder wells and the built-in transom tuna tubes . Hooked baits , pitch baits , live chum  --  the options are limitless with all the live well capacity available on the Revenge 35 LT . Fishing machine If you have too much stuff to store on this center console , then you have too much stuff . There are big stowage compartments everywhere , including lockable rod storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head option available . The ultimate add-on , however , is the massive bow " coffin " box with fish/gear storage and lockable rod racks . A 400-pound tuna will have elbowroom in here ! With a $9,800 price tag , this option is n't cheap , but I ca n't imagine ordering the boat without one . The 35 LT passed its real test with flying colors . In less than two hours of slow trolling live " greenies " in 75 feet of water , guest James Ewing and I each released a nice Atlantic sailfish among the five we raised . The spacious bow was the perfect vantage point for our light tackle confrontations while the other baits remained in the water off the stern . We were never crowded , nor overwhelmed with a three-man crew , and our success confirmed my earlier appraisal  --  this is one fine fishing machine . As you might imagine , the inventive systems and high-quality construction materials that make up the Revenge 35 Light Tackle do n't come cheap . But what 's the value of your leisure time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the only boat fanatic with an itch to sea trial the impressive new Revenge 35 LT . On the night Sadowsky accepted Motor Boating 's Editors ' Choice Award in Miami , the boat I tested was docked behind his attorney 's Los Olas Isles home in Ft . Lauderdale . A boat ride was scheduled the following day with potential buyers from Kuwait . Sadowsky checked on the rig at 1 a.m. before hitting the sack . The electronics compartment was locked , and the ignition keys were removed . When he returned to the boat at 6 a.m. the next morning , Sadowsky discovered the brand-new center console missing . He immediately called the police and filed a report . Three days later , law enforcement officers found the 35 LT drifting loose and banging up against a seawall on Biscayne Bay in the 79th Street area of North Miami . The twin outboards , all the electronics and some hardware had been stripped . Investigators speculate the boat was cased during test rides and then towed away from the dock during the night. - D.L .
