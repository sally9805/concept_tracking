AT EIGHT O'CLOCK , just as the August heat began to withdraw from the day , leaving it weakened , much as a fever does a body , Pierre , a man on the eve of retirement , left his desk and the embarrassment of documents he had spread haphazardly across it over the course of his working day , to take a walk in the Luxembourg Gardens . His research was progressing surprisingly well despite his fatigue and the oppressive heat wave that certainly might have incommoded him . Yet he possessed a strong will , a blustering fortitude , and would not have allowed any common disturbance to get the upper hand . He had purchased a five-speed rotating fan at the Bon Marche when the heat began to thicken , and kept it on all day as he worked and at night in the bedroom when he slept with the help of a sleeping pill . <p> Pierre left his flat at a brisk clip , for this was how he always walked , as if to some vital rhythm . One might have guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he carried portentous news . Here was a man who thrust his person so entirely into the world that he himself was news of a sort , news perhaps that Man , because of his passions , could rule the earth for a time , or at least that he believed it was his birthright to try . Because of his status in life , he was what the French considered an intellectual , but by temperament and ambition he would more justly be called a politician , for he was an expedient , handshaking sort of man . Pierre had passions and opinions of iron that would one day weigh heavily on his soul . For seven years he had been estranged from his young wife , and still he could not understand how it was that his manhood had ceased to please her . In fact he understood nothing of this wife : at the age of fifty , he had married her simply because she was lovely in that ripe yet delicate way that women are in their thirtieth year . She was soft-spoken and made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paint her as he pleased . And when she realized what had happened , that he betrayed her with his paint and a woman bearing no likeness to herself , the marriage was too late for salvage , for when she spoke of herself , he could not hear her and when she wept , he could not see her . And so she left him to live in the apartment below his , and for his sake , did not invite her lovers home but went away for love . Pierre sorely regretted this loss , yet even so he would take no pains to hear her speak or see her cry . Perhaps he was simply incapable of the surrender , of that particular humility a woman required of a man . He had no penchant for earnest introspection , no inclination to question and study the vagaries of the innermost heart . What he preferred were the mind 's vigorous strides and a voice that stroked his own . Once though , for an entire year , he fell prey to a grievous depression that brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death . He would tell people later that this taste was indescribable , something akin to vomit , something abject and from the bowels but much worse . His whole face would twist up in grimace when he spoke of this , as if the very taste were lurking not far off and needed to be warded away . <p> Pierre walked twice around the Luxembourg Gardens as was his habit , looking from time to time at other strollers and at the more sedentary Parisians in the pea-green chairs . The gardens seemed to him like a vast amphitheater with an expectant audience , and he imagined himself taking the podium with decorum as he did at the university . He had always particularly enjoyed the attention of a feminine audience . He loved the feel of a woman 's thirsting gaze as she looked at him for the answers he was prepared to give . When he was younger , he had seduced several of his more lovely college students . These jejune conquests had been easy enough , for he had been handsome then and quite confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discriminate eye , he took notice of the pretty young women who sat in clusters around their talk . A sudden impulse might have caused him to clap his hands at them for their attention , but remembering where he was , which was not upon a lecturer 's podium but on public soil , he simply walked past them with an uncomfortable longing . He continued making his way around the gardens , for he was trying to exercise his heart , which had grown weak over the years , with a brisk walk . <p> The sun was beginning to set , but night would not fall for another hour or so . As he was leaving the park , Pierre bought himself an Eskimo Pie from a vendor who stood with her white Gervais icebox just outside the park gates . He ate quickly , biting rather than licking , and had finished the ice cream by the time he reached the rue Soufflot . He felt rejuvenated now from the walk and quite fit , although a light-headedness soon began to dizzy him . This sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he secretly yearned for the rush , for he mistook this sweet queasiness for a lightness of heart , as if he were en fete , his burdens tossed into a holiday pyre . Before him , the city suddenly undressed herself , laying bare her inner whorls , her spiraling organs of hidden pleasure . Why , he could almost touch that flesh , feel its warmth as if human blood were running through it . A moan rising from the pleasure point of his body moved up through him and out his lips . Oui , he seemed to be saying . <p> Why the man was privy to this intimate display , indeed perhaps its sole audience , he , himself , could not have known , nor in all likelihood would he have thought to ask . The eye , if not tempered and guided by love , will be the smoothest of takers , and Pierre consumed the inner city as he would a plate of pate or an eau de vie . Pleasure of the palate was , among the many sensations known to Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensations swam through the channels of his body like a life-altering secretion . He was witness to the irresistibly sweet , to something as delicious as the precocious fruiting of girls . Beautiful it was , but heady , too heady . <p> Pierre then turned into a boulangerie and bought himself a roast beef sandwich . Earth-bound meat would land him back on his feet , where gravity would avail him . Cold beef would be the sobering antidote to the heated rush of the flight . Pierre ate half the sandwich in two very large bites ; then , feeling his strength sift back into place , hardening like soil , the earth of his muscles , he tossed the other half into a garbage can . As he was reluctant to return right then to the solitude of his flat , he strolled leisurely now , peering into store windows . There was one store that he had always liked ; it was a stationery shop of sorts with handsome papers , quill pens , and inks . He was standing at its window eyeing a particular pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a young woman . <p> " That 's a beautiful set , " she said , turning her head to him but pointing to the pens . " I 've been admiring it too . " Pierre then turned to the girl , who was looking at him most candidly . She was young , he saw , in her early twenties no doubt , and quite pretty at that . She was dressed in a lemon-colored summer suit and carried a large white plastic mannequin bag over her shoulder . The only thing he might have faulted her with was her mouth , which tended to move lopsidedly as she talked , as if she were squeezing a toothpick or a cigarette in one of its corners . This gave her at moments a ducklike air that would have better suited a man , he thought , but he forgave this as she was otherwise lovely with smooth , clear skin and chestnut hair cut stylishly in a shoulder-length bob . She looked at him intently and her eyes appeared almost black , so dilated were her pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then quickly adjusted . Had n't he been dealt a most attractive card ? Well , well , he thought , I will play it . <p> " I had one just like it some years ago but lost it in Venice , " he said . " That was at a conference . " Pierre liked to mention that he was often invited abroad as a guest speaker . <p> " Yes , " she said , nodding her head as if she already knew this but acknowledged the reminder . " It 's a Wonder Plume , " she went on . " It comes in gold , silver , and silver plate with a matte finish in both fountain and ball-point . The suggested retail price is fifteen hundred francs . " The girl spoke now looking into the window . Her manner was oddly clipped and exact , not conversational . This might have bewildered Pierre , but his mind was already much too engaged in imagining where this delightful encounter was leading . <p> " But the price here says two thousand francs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want to buy it here . This shop is much too expensive . There is a wonderful place where I buy the pens for my company . You can get it there if you like . Or I could order it for you . " <p> " Well , that is very nice of you , but maybe you could tell me where it is ? " <p> " Oh , I 'm afraid it 's extremely hard to find . I 'd have to sit down and draw you a map . It 's in a suburb . " Pierre now saw his chance to invite this girl away from the window and street to the intimacy of a room . <p> " Well , perhaps we could have a drink if you like and you could draw me that map . " <p> " Yes , " she said , looking at him , her eyes pooling with a soft wetness . Why , she was lovely , as docile as a kitten , and she desired him ! Pierre nearly rushed her vigorously away like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his position in the world , simply touched her elbow to indicate the way . <p> " I had that same pen myself , " she said as they walked down the street . " It was given to me by my uncle upon my graduation from Sciences Po . I had it for several years but then lost it in Rome at a seminar . Oh , I was very upset about it ! But now with the great deal of money I make , I am able to buy myself a new one . I graduated at the top of my class , which was how I received a grant from the Ministry of Finance and was able to start the company of which I am now president . " <p> " So you run a company ? " he asked , picking up on the tail of what she had been saying , although he had not really been following her . His ears were entirely tuned to the erotic stirrings of his own body , to that inexorable music that plays in a man throughout his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the changes in his blood and loins that the world outside his newly sexed body held little appeal . Even the girl 's conversation bored him , though the girl of course , as the object of his seduction , was of great interest . " Would it seem too forward if I were to invite you to my place ? I live right around the corner , you see . Perhaps you would enjoy champagne ? " He spoke before she could answer him and with that particular Frenchman 's politesse . There was an irony to it , an underside that was calculating . <p> " Yes , " said the girl matter-of-factly , as if confirming something she had been thinking . " I am very fond of champagne , " she went on . " Did you know that after degorgement , each bottle is refilled and sweetened with a liqueur of wine and sugar to suit a particular taste ? The degorgeur is typically a man although there is one woman in France of the metier . Her name is Angelina . Angelina Oudinet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shop window : He saw himself escorting this attractive and willing girl at his side to his master bed . Suddenly life was as it should be : desires were expediently appeased . Whether just or unjust , he was the gods ' pet . Pierre did not doubt he was deserving , and so in the sixty-third year of his life , he was given a young girl , a girl with full breasts pushing ripe from the summer suit , more like an Italian woman than a Frenchwoman . And his mind turned back some hundred pages to a past history with his Venetian lover , Carina . How beautiful she was , poised and silent in a gondola ! And how he had loved her on the Lido ! Madly he did ! The memory of this prized lover rekindled a lingering ember ; the flame grew for a moment in his heart , illuminating that dark , inner cavern , then faltered and died as if blown down by a present wind . Pierre 's spirits were put out before he could utter a wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " How old are you ? " <p> " I 'm twenty-four , " she answered candidly , not in the least surprised by this question . The man resumed walking , feeling now his youthful bonhomie return . Of all answers possible , she had given him the right one . She could not have done better . Accuracy pleased him , and she had hit the mark . <p> Pierre quickened the pace and the girl reached under his arm and slipped hers through it . Arm in arm they reached his flat on the rue Claude Bernard where they then disengaged limbs so that the man could open the gate and let them in . Walking through the courtyard , he moved ahead but reached behind him and grabbed her small , manicured hand . Pierre no longer marveled at how quickly he had tamed this girl-stranger , this lovely doe . Now she stood on his property , and it was he who had brought her there so smoothly , without recourse to the usual outings of seduction . How could he not feel proud ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl 's hands slide across his lower back and grip on to his sides . It meant a great deal to him to be touched like this by a woman . Why , it always had . It made him feel his maleness keenly , as if the feminine temperatures distilled his manliness , bringing it forth in the purest essence . Once in his flat , the girl 's hands continued their caress up and down his body . She moved in front of him and kissed his face , then hungrily his mouth . Her appetite pleased him at first and he met her with the same . But then , her kissing grew strangely frantic , as if she were desperately trying to put him , the whole man , into her mouth , and he began to imagine an unpleasant impulse behind it . Pierre pulled away from her abruptly . Lifting his head , he looked down at the girl sternly ; then , seeing that she reclined once again into a sweet , girlish posture , he took her hand and led her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that boudoir pleased Pierre very much and perhaps would have given him even greater pleasure if the past seven years of abstinence had n't left him unpracticed . Despite his faltering , he had done his best , which was not bad at all , and the girl appeared quite satisfied indeed . She lay curled up beside him , her head on his chest breathing softly upon his skin . Holding this feminine contentment in his arms , Pierre 's heart colored and opened to the sentiments of love . He could not help himself . He loved this purring girl who lay sweetly upon his body as if he were the earth . It did not occur to him that he did not know her name , or that she was a perfect stranger to him : his emotions left him gaping at the feel of her . <p> Eventually the girl stirred and asked him if she could have something to eat . Pierre got out of bed then , put on a robe , and went into the kitchen . The girl got up too and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt her lover had been wearing and slipped it on . She followed him out but stayed in the living room and took a seat on the couch . Pierre came out a few minutes later with the bottle of champagne and a plate of smoked salmon upon which he had set several lemon wedges . <p> " This is a beautiful , high-ceilinged flat , " the girl said as he set the tray down on the coffee table . " And I admire your display of paintings . Could you tell me about them ? " Pierre was eager to do so and spoke for a few minutes about his latest acquisition , a painting by a highly esteemed contemporary painter whom he knew personally . As he spoke , the girl listened intently , nodding her head from time to time in agreement . <p> " There are , " she said when he had finished , " a hundred and thirtyfive galleries on the left bank between the rue Bonaparte and the boulevard Saint Michel . Thirty of these galleries display works of primitive art while another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern bloc countries . The galleries with the highest turnover are located on the rue de Seine . Their artists are primarily Western European and their clients are Japanese . " Pierre looked at the girl quizzically : she did not speak conversationally , but as if she were reading off a fact card . <p> " And how do you know all this ? " he asked . <p> " That is my business , you see . " <p> " Your business ? " <p> " Yes , as I told you , I am president of a company that collects information on about everything and everyone . It is called Information Analysis , which is an American-sounding name . In the United States there are twenty companies that share this name but in France , as I have a copyright on it , there are no others . " <p> " But what is the point of this company ? " Pierre emphasized the word " point . " His eyes narrowed on the girl as they would have on a student presenting a dubious expose . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is always someone who wants information on someone else . Discreet intelligence can be very helpful . If the government thought that you were engaged in work that might be harmful to the state , they would call upon my services to get the correct information about what exactly it is you do . That 's about how it works . " <p> The girl 's gaze was no longer dark and yielding ; her pupils were now the size of a pinhead , and a crude light animated the brown of the eye . Specks of light occasionally moved and flickered as if some unsteady lamp were hanging tenuously behind the eye . When the lamp swung , darts of vivacity played in the iris . When it hung still , the eye was dull and turbid . Pierre was beginning to feel uneasy , even hostile towards the girl . Clearly she was lying to him . But the taste of their lovemaking was still fresh in him , tempering his growing distrust . Pierre did not want to encourage any bad blood . Her story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should this upset him ? Remembering the tenderness he had felt for her some minutes before , he opened the champagne with a certain flourish and filled two flutes . <p> " I was in Connecticut this summer doing research , " he began . <p> " Ah ! " interrupted the girl , " Conneticuts ! How I love this place ! Although I have never been there , it 's true . But the name , Conneticuts ! It 's wonderful ! Do you know , " she said , lifting her glass to him in an intimate toast and wiggling herself closer to him on the couch , " that despite its smallness there is considerable temperature variation ? Conneticuts enjoys the temperate four-season climate . " <p> Now , there was something wrong-and the man had to acknowledge it-about her manner of speaking ; her language and thought seemed the fruit of some mechanical action , unanimated by any thought or spirit of her own-an alien discourse , coming from no catalog Pierre could have identified . The queerness of it began to fill him with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the irrationality of his response as he was by the strangeness of this girl 's conversation . He decided then that the best thing to do was to keep her quiet . <p> " Do you know , mademoiselle , " he said to her in a serious , paternal tone of voice , " that you have not bothered to tell me your name ? " <p> " Oh ! " she laughed girlishly . " I call myself Victoria . That is a British name . " <p> " Well , Victoria ... , " Pierre began . But he finished by pressing his mouth firmly over hers . He had her quiet and kept her this way , and she submitted to the pressure of his lips . They embraced beyond the moment when the man 's mouth suddenly , like the worn link of a chain , broke and lost its hold . Now she played on his lips as if they were her instrument , her reed and river . But no song came of that breath , no joy took wings to free the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an irresistible tyranny , Pierre felt his resolution sapped , as if his manhood were the sum of his muscles now being driven down . The girl and the cushion of the couch held his weight in a way he could not . Divested , he was , of any garment of strength . The fabric of his fleshy bands and bundles had been unwoven thread by thread and he , like a paying patient , let it happen . Now the room was oppressively hot . <p> " Please , " he said in almost a whisper . " I am tired . " He brushed the girl off him lightly with his hand . Obedient to his gesture , she sat back , but a pained light throbbed in her eyes with muted regularity . Pierre thought things could be repaired in the morning , but now he lacked the force to humor or reassure her . Already , his mind had walked him to the bedroom and opened the bedside drawer where his packet of sleeping pills lay cradled . He longed for somnolence , that terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would go down like a soldier after good battle , lean and fatigued from the letting of seed . <p> Yet that night , the pill did not work its bellows . He was not blown out and down , but lumbered through the night somewhere between waking and sleeping . The room was intolerably stuffy , although the fan was turning at top speed , and neither the man nor the girl neared the other 's body . It was too hot for lovers ' sleep , too hot for sleep at all . Sometime in the dawn Pierre told the girl he could no longer stay in the overheated bed and went to the couch in the living room . There he was at last granted several hours of deep , dreamless slumber . <p> It was eight o'clock when Pierre awoke . He lay on the sofa for a moment before getting up and heard a rustling in the bedroom , reminding him of the girl . He lifted himself from the couch only to find he had a headache . With all the work he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , would certainly not help . He went , then , into the bedroom . Pierre expected the girl would be dressed or getting dressed , but she was not . Wearing his shirt , she sat Indian style on the bed with her mannequin bag in her lap . She was talking quietly into a cell phone and around her , on the bed , were neat , thick packs of five-hundred-franc bills . Pierre stood speechless looking at the money on the bed . His mind quickly estimated that she had some hundred thousand francs . <p> " Oh ! " she said , setting down the cell phone . " I 've got to get this to the safe right away . I really must be going ! " <p> " Going where ? Good God ! What are you doing with all that money ? " <p> " A client paid me yesterday in cash , a Russian . But this is much too long to explain . I must get to my office right away . " The girl spoke as if she were pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least . On the contrary , not quickly but distractedly , she began to count the bills and put them in her bag . Like a repetitive Sisyphus , she seemed continually to lose her count at the very last and was obliged to start over . A terror seized Pierre as the animal heat of adrenaline rushed through him . It was the terror one feels upon awakening from a dream so true to one 's wishes that the waking world bears the marks of a disquieting unreality . He would have her out of the house as soon as he could . Something was awry , yes , something was wrong , very wrong . He could not yet name the particular peril , but he sensed he would be prey to it if he were not expedient . <p> " I 'm going to make some coffee and then you will have to go . I must start my work . " <p> " Oh ! But I do n't even have time for coffee . I must be going ! " she cried out nervously . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absentmindedly . A bit like a child or a monkey might do . Pierre left to fix the coffee in the kitchen . He noticed his hands were shaking and so put them under the cold-water tap until he felt his nerves calm . Who the hell is she ? The question rang in his head like an alarm . That he had no answer , no quick means to quiet the siren , distressed him nearly to the point of anger . And still further away , at the farthest edge of his consciousness , a voice mocked him : You 've been had , old man . Yet Pierre discerned it as if it were coming from another room . He contained himself , knowing that it was best to remain collected until she was out of the house . It had finally dawned on him that she was utterly mad . <p> When he came out with the coffee , he found the girl in the living room taking pictures of his paintings . Quickly he set down the two cups of coffee and grabbed her by both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking her with each word . <p> " I 'm sorry but it was just that I really do love your paintings and wanted to remember them . " <p> " You will take no photos in my home ! " His voice was low and stern , the voice of a biblical patriarch . Again , the girl 's eyes seemed to throb with hurt . <p> " Well , I 'm sorry , " she mustered quickly . " I must go now . I must get to my safe . I 'm late as it is . I hope , " she said now with much sweetness , " that I will see you again , my dear man . " <p> " Yes , yes , yes , " said Pierre under his breath , heading her toward the door with an arm around her back . How he wanted her out of his house ! " Oui , tres bien , " he said as he closed the door behind her . <p> Pierre sat down to his desk with his coffee , but his state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his way back to his work . Clearly the day was lost . Looking for some piece of housekeeping to busy himself , he went to change the bed sheets . He wanted to rid his bed of the girl 's scent . As he was walking through the living room on his way to the bedroom , however , he spied her camera and phone under the coffee table . For a moment he panicked , wondering if she had left the dubious stash of money as well . He searched everywhere in the flat and to his great relief found nothing . He then opened the camera and ripped out the roll of film . She would most likely come back for the camera , yes , but she would not have pictures of his home . Whoever she was , she would not have that . Whoever she was . Odd , how it had not mattered to him earlier : then , he had seen her presence as an indulgence , a gift bestowed to him . He did not even question the channel by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to ask her name . Now he wished he had asked her family name as well , for he felt that he must know about her . Perhaps he could find her number by calling the telephone company and identifying her phone . He knew little about such phones but thought there was a way to do this . And so he called . <p> " Please , could you tell me what the phone in question looks like ? " the operator asked . But the phone had neither the name of its make nor an identification number written on it . <p> " I 'm sorry , sir , " said the operator , " but that is not a phone , I am afraid , but a toy . " <p> " A toy ! Yes , I see , " he said pensively . " Very well , " he quickly curtailed the call . " Je vous remercie , monsieur . " The operator certainly thought him a fool , but he was less embarrassed than spooked by his own astonishment . He might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But instead he shaped the question clay differently : Who , he asked , was she who drank me ? His two trembling hands pulled the plastic toy apart . Obeying some primitive reflex , he brought one half of the hollow toy to his ear , keeping it there just for a moment . " Whore ! " he burst out , throwing the phone to the ground . Nom de Dieu ! He paced about his flat with great energy , cursing the girl , this Victoria , for her thieving thirst , her bag of tricks . The slut ! He should have known better . Pierre was not a man given to wonder of the spectral , nor was he inclined to utter profanities , yet now he threw the energy of his gait against the malicious spirits in the room . Though his mind searched for an explanation , he could make no sense of his queer predicament . He would have to wait until she came back . But would she ? He had to believe that she would : she had left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , he would simply go mad . The flat suffocated his confusion , confining him in his most unbecoming fears . And so he quickly showered and dressed . The water and clean laundry against his skin would armor him against the peradventure of the day . Or so he believed as he headed toward the door , light-footed and whistling a song of his youth . Yes , he was feeling better , nearly refreshed . But when he got to the door , there was something amiss : the keys which he always left in the lock , so as not to lose track of them , were not there . Thinking at first that he might have put them elsewhere , though this was unlikely , he began to search his flat . As he turned over books and papers and looked under couches and chairs , a panic crept up slowly from his belly like a vine bearing bad news . The girl had taken his keys . He knew this even as he continued to pull apart his home . They were sitting in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes . " The bitch ! " he said , still on his hands and knees , having just peered beneath the buffet . " The slut ! " But the image of her giving him a particular pleasure he had not been given for so long , came to him with cinematic sharpness . It had a totally unexpected weaponry of its own , shellfire in a deserted wood . Pierre gasped as the pain ran up his arm to grip his heart . His limp body dropped without resistance . <p> At six o'clock the phone rang . Pierre had been convalescing upon the doctor 's orders and , after an afternoon of rest under the lee of a rotating fan , was feeling his habitual strength and vigor return . He was happy for this interruption in his solitude and rest . It was , much as he expected , the girl , Victoria . <p> " My dear Pierre , I have not stopped thinking about you all day , " she said in a light , flirtatious voice . " Could I see you again tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Yes , why do n't you come over now . That would be fine . " Pierre kept his voice steady , not wanting to scare her away . He did n't mention the keys . He would let her come to him , but this time she would not enter . <p> A half an hour later the buzzer of his interphone rang . He got the camera and went to the door . " Yes ? " he said , pressing the button . <p> " It 's me . " <p> " Stay there . I 'll be right down . " <p> " Oh , do n't bother coming down those stairs . I 'll just come up . " <p> " No ! Stay right where you are . I 'm coming down . " Pierre spoke again in the patriarch 's voice that availed him at university and that he had often adopted to educate his children . He had trained and tuned it to a perfect pitch for commanding obedience and had used it as often on his daughters as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as she had longed for his fondling . He knew from his years of parenting that this was the way children were . As he made his way down the stairwell , he shrunk her down in his mind until she had the dimensions of a very naughty Alice who would profit well by a spanking on the bottom . The morning 's haunted anxiety that had reached and discouraged his heart now took its exit with each blustering step down his mountain . <p> When Pierre reached the courtyard , he spied the girl in the dark behind the bars of the gate . She held on to one of the iron bars expectantly . " Hello , " she said brightly , watching him approach . Pierre said nothing until he stood directly in front of the gate . The vaulted entryway kept out all light . The girl , cast in its darkness , was barely visible . <p> " Wo n't you open this gate ? " <p> " You will give me my keys , " he told her . <p> " What keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do not play these games with me . Get my keys out of your bag and hand them to me now . " The girl looked completely bewildered but obediently opened her mannequin bag and began rummaging through it . " I ca n't imagine they 're here , " she said as her hand fumbled in the bag . " Why would they be ? " <p> " They are in there , " Pierre said coolly and with certainty . <p> " Oh ! " said the girl , reaching her hand farther down into the purse and stopping it there . " Oh , look . Here they are ! They must have fallen in there somehow . " Pierre held his hand out on his side of the gate so that she had to reach through to give him the keys . The girl 's whole body seemed to wilt under the weight of her disappointment . " I 'm sorry , " she began , " please . . . " Her tone was mendacious , unbecoming . <p> " Now , " he interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my home again . And I forbid you to call or contact me in any way . Take this , " he said , handing her the camera , " and go away from here . " The girl turned away and left . Pierre stood watch until the door behind her closed shut . Good riddance ! he congratulated himself . But as he walked back up the stairs to his flat , he realized that he was shaking . And as he reached the third floor , his head , as if losing its moorings , began to spin . Once in his flat , he promptly took a pill for his heart , then stretched out on the couch . Company would be coming , some out-of-town colleagues to join him for dinner . As he did not cook , he would take them out to a restaurant . It was good that they were coming : even if he felt ill , he could not bear to spend the evening alone . And he would , of course , feel better after a bit of rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion , entertaining them with amusing stories about common friends and university politics . After several rounds of drinks , he led his group to the restaurant , a mere five-minute walk from his flat . It was pleasant outside , as the heat wave had at last begun to subside . There were clouds now covering the sky which would crack soon , releasing their waters over parched Paris . A certain electrical tension filled the air , which was not disagreeable after the weeks of still , procrastinating heat . Pierre was delighted to be with his friends and enjoyed making jokes here and there and patting them on the back , calling them Mon vieux . Deciding to take a shortcut , he led his friends down a side street . Yet he had taken no more than five steps when he was stopped dead in his tracks . There in front of him was Victoria , sitting on the edge of a fountain at the end of the street , waiting it seemed . Pierre quickly signaled to his friends to back up , telling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned around , the girl spotted him . She arose from the fountain ledge and without a word or gesture began walking towards them . Her gait was as slow and fated as a somnambulist 's . Her face was strangely expressionless apart from her mouth , which was lopsidedly pursed . Pierre looked back and caught her eye . He threw her a furious look that said , " Do n't you dare ! " but she , disregarding the warning , continued to follow . Growing nervous , Pierre sped up . He did not need to look over his shoulder , for he now sensed her presence behind him . By means of some animal sense , he knew . He kept his friends walking straight ahead and , when they reached the restaurant , opened the door with no little relief , and went in . <p> Victoria had not followed them to the restaurant . There was no sign of her now . Pierre had been keeping a wary eye on the window and felt sufficiently reassured . His usual bonhomie returned as the entrees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated . Politics was a subject close to Pierre 's heart , and he defended his views passionately , at times waving his arms and raising his voice indignantly . He had had the same argument with these particular colleagues many times , and they all seemed to enjoy their ritualized dispute . No resolution ever needed to be reached , for the ideas were never taken as seriously as the ritual itself . It prescribed an end punctuated by a toast and pervaded by good feeling . Now , however , in the heat of the debate , and as he was finishing his pate de campagne , Pierre looked quickly out the window as if by reflex . At first he saw only a couple walking down the sidewalk adjacent to the restaurant , but as he extended his vision across the street , he saw the girl , leaning against a bus-stop pole and looking , it seemed , straight at him . She stared unflinchingly , but with no trace of recognition or expression in her gaze . Pierre felt furious blood rising in his veins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Now , all the passions of the last twenty-four hours , the lust , the tenderness , the bewilderment , and the fear , seemed to converge and commit themselves to the strong arm of anger . And this anger seized him not only emotionally but physically , gripping first his shoulder then moving through the chest . Now aware that he saw her , the girl moved forward , taking her camera out of her mannequin bag . She aimed it at Pierre and began shooting , steadily and continually as she crossed the street , shot after shot , with the insistence of a paparazzo . She approached and her lens moved in on him . Now she was at the window itself , the rim of her lens nearly touching the glass . Pierre opened his mouth to protest but no words came . He tried to lift himself from his chair but no strength of the legs availed him . He fell , face and arms upon the table . He fell as a searing pain ripped through his chest and reached the organ , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not venture . <p> An ambulance came promptly , and the girl , without flinching , followed her lover from table to stretcher to ambulance with her camera . When at last the ambulance pulled away , she put the camera back in her bag and walked slowly away down the street , stopping from time to time to gaze into store windows . It was almost dark ; only a few lone strollers were on the street . A man in his fifties with wild , peppery hair was walking towards Victoria , who had stopped to look into a boutique . From the way he fixed his gaze on the girl and moved indolently but deliberately towards her , his intentions were clear . Perhaps he had met with her before like this , on the street just as night was falling , although what he said to her would make one think not . <p> " Enchante , " he whispered almost into her ear as he stopped just behind her back . <p> " Enchante , " she said turning around , face to face with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked sweetly and irresistibly into his .
