<p> When most people think of chowder , three types come to mind : fish , clam , and corn . But during the two years he researched this hearty dish , Jasper White discovered almost as many variations as there are fish in the sea . The New England chef , whose authoritative cookbooks and frequent TV appearances have lent him celebrity status beyond his region , tested nearly 100 recipes for his latest book " 50 Chowders : One-Pot Meals - Clam , Corn &; Beyond " ( Scribner , 256 pp. , $ 30 ) . Of the recipes he chose , 20 do n't include seafood , and a few , such as the Pheasant and Cabbage Chowder , are his own innovations . Over a bowl of chowder ( what else ? ) and a plate of oysters at the Summer Shack , his wildly popular , family-style restaurant in Cambridge , Mass. , Mr. White talked enthusiastically about this project and the dish he 's always loved . " Chowder has always gotten a bad rap because it 's such a humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the beautiful things about it . " In his book , White devotes the first chapter to the evolution of chowder . And in person , he gives the sound-bite version . " All the early chowders were made with staples or ' found ' foods such as cod , clams , or bass . There are many theories , but the culinary historians I most admire believe chowder originated at sea using basic staples aboard most fishing vessels in the early 1700s - salt pork , hardtack or ' ship 's biscuit , ' and fresh fish . " If his book had been called " One Chowder , " it would have been devoted to New England fish chowder , says White , since it preceded all others . " Clams were n't mentioned in recipes until 70 to 80 years later . Chowder was simply a way to cook cod . " This theory is supported , White says , by the first written reference to North American chowder , which uses the word as a verb . In a diary entry from 1732 , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine chowdered cod . " It might have been worth a note in his diary , but that first chowder was nothing to write home about . " It was like gruel , " says White , grimacing . " You 'd eat it when you were really hungry , and you 'd keep quiet about it . Original chowders , made before stoves , were layered . Potatoes were considered poisonous , so hardtack was the starch of choice . And they 'd cook with the whole fish . Forget filleting or deboning it . " Not until the early 1800s , after the invention of the stove , did chowder " get good , " says White . " There was also a lot of excitement about foods arriving from places such as the Caribbean , and cooks experimented with herbs and spices . " About 1850 , New England cooking began to lose its passion , says White . " A staid Puritan ethic took over , and cooking became something you did only to feed your family . " In spite of this , chowder parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught fire . At those summertime gatherings , chowders might include , for the first time , clams , tomatoes , potatoes , corn , milk , cream , and butter . In the 1950s and ' 60s , which he calls the " dark ages " of America 's culinary history for its turn toward convenience , fast-food chains made chowder into a dull , pasty soup . " When a home dish goes commercial , its integrity is often lost , " he explains . White , who got his training at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America , is gratified that what he calls the " Jackie O. years " brought new appreciation of fine food . But it was n't until the past 20 years , he says , that chowder got a " new lease on life and a second look by chefs and food writers . " Fortunately , he adds , this appreciation has only increased despite the desire for quick meals to suit today 's fast-paced lives . Which leads White to conclude that chowder is today 's ideal food since it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it has " cured " for at least an hour and preferably , for a night or two . Chowder 's most defining ingredients are potatoes ( White prefers Yukon Gold ) and salt pork or bacon . Without those , it could be a stew or a soup . Onions are also essential . And key to a flavorful chowder is homemade stock and the freshest fish . His book includes extensive sections on both stockmaking and selecting , storing , and filleting fish . " Get to know your fish vendor , " he urges . Some of White 's fish chowder recipes feature bluefish , striped bass , or salmon , but he says that cod , haddock , and bass are his all-time favorites . " They are why chowder was created in the first place . Their lean and flaky texture balances beautifully with the richness of chowder .

Add the fish and cook over low heat for 5 minutes ; remove pot from heat and allow the chowder to sit for 10 minutes ( the fish will finish cooking during this time ) .
