Trends and issue to keep track of <p> The start of a new year always seems to provoke a peculiar sort of perspective-taking activity : the ranking and listing of various things pertaining either to the old year leaving or the new year coming . The editors of CR plead guilty to giving in to the impulse and herewith offer a list of the top stories to which consumers should pay attention in the year 2004 : 1 . Health Savings Accounts <p> Consumers should be excited about the new health savings account ( HSA ) provision in last year 's prescription drug law . HSAs are far simpler to obtain and operate than their predecessors , medical savings accounts , and provide consumers with greater freedom over their medical expenses . To qualify for an HSA , a person must be under age 65 and covered only by a high-deductible health insurance policy , one with annual out-of-pocket costs of at least $1,000 for an individual or $2,000 for a family . The government expects about 40 million Americans to be eligible for HSAs right away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax-free nature of HSAs . Contributions to the account are tax-deductible , interest earned within each account is tax-free , and withdrawals are not taxed if they are used to pay for qualified medical expenses . Even better , account funds not used in one year can roll over to the next to help pay for future expenses and they also can be carried from job to job and into retirement . <p> Although , it is too early to tell how effective HSAs will be for consumers , one thing is sure : Very soon health insurance companies will start competing to offer plans for both individuals and families . This should provide consumers will more options in managing their health care . 2 . Regulation of Junk Food <p> In 2003 , obesity-related topics dominated headlines in several forms . From consumer lawsuits to obesity studies , from the Atkins diet to the deadly health effects of trans-fatty acids , America has grown obsessed over solutions to rising obesity and 2004 promises no end to the debate . Once derided as simply a boon for trial lawyers and cash-strapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a topic of major concern for consumers . A good example of this shift is what was said at an American Public Health Association conference in December . Margo Wooten , a director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest , told the crowd that in order to fight obesity in America " we have got to move beyond personal responsibility . " The obesity fight , real or imagined , has quickly gained the mantle of government responsibility . <p> So-called " sin taxes " are nothing new , however . Taxes on alcohol and cigarettes have been around for decades as a way promoting healthier lifestyles while raising state revenues . So far , courts have dismissed many of the lawsuits  --  most notably , the case of a New York man suing McDonald 's for making him fat  --  and the food industry for the most part has successfully resisted tighter regulation . Legislative action against junk food has fared much better . City governments and public school boards have successfully implemented measures to curb obesity , especially among children , such as banning soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone global . The World Health Organization is considering an obesity-related advisory plan to present to various nations including the United States . The Financial Times reports that a centerpiece of the plan is to applaud the positive effect of junk-food taxes . As Wooten 's quote above suggests , the debate has evolved from personal responsibility to nanny-state politics with the food industry in the role as the villain . This year do n't be surprised when you 're told that your food budget is going to go up because the government wants your waistline to go down . 3 . Health Care Accountability <p> With Health Savings Accounts will come both greater consumer opportunity , and the need for greater consumer responsibility in selecting appropriate health plans . Directly affected by these new options will be providers of financial services and insurers . What 's perhaps less obvious is that the new options may portend an even bigger revolution in how medicine itself is organized and delivered . <p> Greater consumer choice will yield two things : first , a greater demand for information about the quality of health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demand for greater government regulation of health-care quality to protect consumers . The main problem is that neither the government nor the private sector has come up with a good way of measuring quality . There is no objective metric that can separate the natural course of an illness from the good or bad effect that a doctor 's care may have . <p> That would n't be a problem if the pool of patients seen by every doctor was of average risk . In that case , measuring doctors . against outcomes would still work . Not only do different doctors face patients of different risk , however , but doctors themselves have some control over the risk of the patients they see . If doctors know they are being judged by outcome , then they have an incentive to avoid serving patients of high risk ( the patients who may need care the most ) and overserving the patients of lowest risk . Studies have confirmed this effect , finding that when doctors are judged by so-called quality report cards , patients who most need a risky procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients who do not benefit from a risky procedure are most likely to receive it . <p> Because the issue of health-care quality touches on so many diverse fields ( medicine , law , insurance , financial services ) it is almost impossible to project how this issue will play out . One thing to pay attention to , however , is whether these various developments lead to a greater integration of the industries involved . In the first place , Health Savings Accounts require some coordination between banks and insurers . At the same time , bringing the doctors directly into the insurance contract with patients could solve the problem of adverse selection that it makes it difficult to measure performance . If a doctor becomes committed by contract to serving a particular pool of insureds , then he can not avoid the patients who are risky . <p> That would not provide a complete solution to the problem of judging quality , because outcomes would still be only a proxy for what consumers really want to know : how good was the doctoring . Further , doctors lately have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they see as their professional prerogatives . The trend has been in the opposite direction , toward much looser association . Thus Health Maintenance Organizations have given way to Preferred Provider Organizations . <p> Still , doctors are also customers of the insurance industry , because they need malpractice insurance . There lies another dilemma for health care accountability . The push for malpractice reform failed last year , which is probably a good thing because it would have imposed a federal solution on an issue that requires more deft balancing than a simple limit on punitive damages . Patients lose if good doctors are driven from medicine by fears of lawsuits , and they lose if bad doctors are n't held accountable . One way of solving the malpractice dilemma is to let consumers decide what malpractice rules they are comfortable with , in other words to make their own tradeoffs over price and quality assurance and to choose insurers who offer the best combination . If insurers could solve doctors ' malpractice problems by writing malpractice rules into the insurance contract , then doctors might be willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cold would be the lawyers . 4 . Internet " Spam " <p> In 2003 , the actions of the federal government constituted the most ambitious counterattack against the techniques of spammers and telemarketers of any single year . Over the summer , the Federal Communications Commission , in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission , enacted the Do-Not-Call Registry . Consumer response was staggering as millions signed up in the first weeks . Then , in December , Congress passed and President Bush signed a bill to stop the flow of e-mail spam premised on the very same idea as the Registry . The question consumers should ask for 2004 is will any of it work ? <p> So far , the Do-Not-Call Registry seems to be operating as intended . According to the FTC , 60 million consumers have added their numbers to the Registry , accounting for almost 50% of available U.S. numbers . More important , consumer complaints are down and the FCC has fined several businesses for violations . On the other hand , telemarketers have filed lawsuits against the Registry claiming that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before 2004 is over , at least one of these complaints will make it to the Supreme Court . <p> In cyberspace , the outlook is n't nearly as hopeful for those who have added their e-mail addresses to the CAN-SPAM Act . Long before the bill became law , industry analysts warned that , because of the realities of the Internet , a bill designed on the Do-Not-Call model would ultimately fail . Providing spammers with a list of active e-mail addresses would only increase their spam production , critics say . While tracking a telephone call is easy , trying to decipher the origin of spam can be exceedingly difficult . A better solution than more legislation might be better " spam-blocker " technology . 5 . Digital Entertainment Online <p> The Internet offers great opportunities for enhancing consumers ' access to high-quality digital media . One bottleneck that still has n't been solved adequately , however , is how to protect copyrights . Without copyright protection , there is less incentive for creators to make their works available online , or even in a digital format . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures for copyright protection and the hackers who try to work around them . <p> The Digital
