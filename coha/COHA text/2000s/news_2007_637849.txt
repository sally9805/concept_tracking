<p> AFTER he was announced last week as the New York Philharmonic 's next music director , Alan Gilbert sometimes sounded like the awestruck kid he once was . Mr. Gilbert grew up as the son of two Philharmonic violinists and visited his parents at work every week in the concert hall . <p> " The orchestra is such an amazing musical organization and organism , collectively and individually , " he said . " I really do n't know any other orchestra that has this exalted level . " He said he never even dared dream he could be its music director . <p> Now think of these words in the mouth of noted podium autocrats like Georg Solti or George Szell or Herbert von Karajan or , especially , Arturo Toscanini , the conducting dictator of all time . Too bizarre to imagine . <p> Mr. Gilbert 's ascension to the throne of one of the world 's great orchestras  --  in the footsteps of Toscanini , Mahler and Mengelberg  --  is a sign of how the persona and conception of the music director has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two years , at 42 , Mr. Gilbert will be almost four decades younger than his predecessor , Lorin Maazel . While he has been the music director at the respectable Royal Stockholm Philharmonic for the last seven years and at the Santa Fe Opera for three summers , Mr. Gilbert is hardly a household name . <p> But he is not alone in that regard , and in the end , it may not matter . <p> Ever heard of Jaap van Zweden ? A busy conductor in Europe , he is the next music director of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra , which with admirable honesty acknowledged in a news release that he was " relatively unknown . " <p> Manfred Honeck ? Look for him at the Pittsburgh Symphony , Mr. Maazel 's alma mater , in 2008 . <p> Gustavo Dudamel ? He is the 26-year-old music director-designate of the Los Angeles Philharmonic , which has a tradition of hiring youngsters ( Zubin Mehta , Esa-Pekka Salonen ) . <p> Five years ago , the Cleveland Orchestra brought in another 42-year-old conductor with relatively low name recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a respectable , if not spectacular , musical run so far , but his effect on attendance and finances is unclear . <p> At least three orchestras  --  the Chicago Symphony , the Philadelphia Orchestra and the National Symphony in Washington  --  have effectively put searches for music director on hold by appointing interim leaders . <p> Following the musical-chairs game at orchestras may seem a little obsessive to some . But the job holds a fascination . It is unique . One man or woman stands in front of 100 fellow human beings  --  unlike them , without the capacity to make sound  --  and yet has the power to shape the great works of sonic art . The conductor 's eyes dart about , seemingly all-seeing , ears all-hearing , a musical intelligence called upon to grasp a work 's architecture and then convey it . He or she is curator of masterpieces , incubator of new works and public performer . <p> " There is no more obvious expression of power than the performance of a conductor , " Elias Canetti once wrote . <p> Off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role in hiring and firing musicians , help raise money and help sell the orchestra . <p> Why does there seem to be a dearth of giants striding the earth these days ? <p> Part of the reason may be that orchestra boards and administrators are consciously looking for younger conductors , partly to attract the young and to counter the perception that audiences are growing older and scarcer . <p> There is also something exciting about taking a risk on a lesser-known commodity , a thrill to watching that person grow into prominence . Never heard of the Philharmonic 's new man ? Gerard Schwarz , the longtime music director of the Seattle Symphony , suggests that Alan Gilbert " will become , in short order , a very famous conductor . " <p> " They 're taking a risk , " Mr. Schwarz said . " Has he conducted all the Mahler symphonies ? Has he conducted all the Strauss tone poems ? Probably not . But if he 's very gifted , and we have to assume he is , it 's terrific . " <p> Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the wane . Elder statesmen like Bernard Haitink , Pierre Boulez , Mr. Maazel , Kurt Masur and others are in their 70s and 80s . Other , younger members of the class , like Daniel Barenboim and Riccardo Muti , have said they have little interest in the non-music-making burdens of an American music directorship . Mr. Muti , in fact , has agreed to devote six to eight weeks to the Philharmonic , but specifically rejected any title , the orchestra 's president , Zarin Mehta , said . He simply wants to " make beautiful music , " Mr. Mehta added . At the same time , the number of full-time orchestras has increased over the last 50 years . <p> So where is the replacement generation of big names ? Michael M. Kaiser , president of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington , said the main reason for their absence was the decline of the classical music recording industry . <p> Up to a decade or so ago , a half-dozen recording giants would release albums featuring their conducting stars and promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push for awards , help manage careers . Now , with few major record releases , conductors are promoted for a week or two in the city where they appear as a guest . <p> " The amount of knowledge people have about them in the general public is vastly diminished , " Mr. Kaiser said . " We 're left with a new generation that has n't had that impact of the recording industry . " <p> The job itself has changed , too . Musicians have an increasingly powerful voice in running the orchestra and choosing its music director . The top administrator , sometimes even given the title of president or chief executive officer , has gained power too . <p> But in many ways , the qualifications for a music director , whether famous or not , are the same : leadership both musical and institutional ; a passionate point of view ; conducting talent ; intelligence . <p> Gary Hanson , the executive director of the Cleveland Orchestra , said that you could divide newly appointed music directors into two columns , household names and non-household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My guess is , " he said , " you would not find that one column dominated the other .
