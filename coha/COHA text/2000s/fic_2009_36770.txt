" Felix , drop your pants . " <p> The last time I heard those words , they were from a topless stripper . <p> Tonight was different , but the wound on my leg hurt too much for me to protest Mel 's words . <p> Mel was the acting head of the local nidus , Latin for " nest , " in this case the community of Denver vampires . Tendrils of anxiety writhed from his orange aura , a bright contrast against the gloom of an autumn night . With a greasy gray mane combed back to his shoulders and scraggly white muttonchops , Mel projected none of the glamour associated with Hollywood vampires . <p> We were on a deserted construction site in Aurora , a suburb east of Denver . Though Aurora 's the second-largest city in Colorado , it 's the Fresno of the Front Range : square mile after square mile of strip malls and cheap rents that run together to create an asphalt grid of nothing . <p> I rested against the foreman 's trailer , unbuckled my trousers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trickled from the teeth marks on the inside of my left thigh . <p> " Smoke ? " Mel asked , astonished . " That damn zombie must have left silver fillings when he bit you . " <p> Silver . No wonder this hurt so much . <p> Mel 's right index fingernail extended into a talon . " Hold still . " <p> I gripped the muscle around the wound to distend the punctures . Mel crouched and slid the razor-sharp nail into an opening where the smoke puffed out . A fresh jolt of pain coursed up my spine and out my arms . He flicked his wrist and a tiny piece of smoking goo spun to the dirt . <p> He spit into his palm and pressed it over the wound . " This is as close to a hand job as you 'll get from me . Does n't mean we 're in love or anything . In fact , please do n't call me in the morning . " <p> I massaged the injured muscle . " How about a card on Valentine 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accelerated my supernatural healing . By this time tomorrow , all I 'd have is another battle scar to add to my collection . <p> I put weight on the leg and it finally felt like I would n't collapse from the pain . I fastened my trousers and limped to the edge of a hole excavated for the basement of a large building . Concrete slabs formed two sides of the hole but the rest was still packed dirt . <p> The zombie shambled within the hole where we 'd chased it . He  --  obviously once a man  --  cradled his head under one arm and used his other to grope along the concrete . His mottled , waxy complexion and the clumps of trash stuck to his grimy clothes made it look like he 'd been rotting in a shallow grave for a week . <p> I had removed the special contacts that masked my tapetum lucidum , the mirror-like retinas at the back of my eyes . The contacts were part of my cover to hide from humans , but wearing them kept me from using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know if zombies had night vision ; I had no idea about any of their powers other than they were supposed to be hard as hell to destroy . Tonight I had discovered an important fact : they had no auras , which made them a bitch to track in the dark . <p> The zombie clawed the dirt wall , climbing up a foot before stumbling backward . He dropped his head . It plopped against the dirt and rolled like a lopsided melon . The animated corpse sank to its knees and crawled along the ground , one arm searching in a wide arc . <p> The head worked its mouth and turned onto its face , where it used its nose and chin to inch toward the body . I was more disgusted than fascinated . Yes , zombies are undead , as we vampires are . But comparing them to us was like comparing turds to eagles . <p> The Araneum , the worldwide network of vampires , has one standing order : Destroy all zombies . <p> The reason ? <p> We must ruthlessly protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  from humans . Their disbelief in the supernatural was what kept us vampires safe . <p> We 've seen what humans have done to one another . <p> War . <p> Genocide . <p> Walmart . <p> Against their growing technical prowess and corporate savagery , what chance did we the undead have ? Our best hope for survival was to remain cloaked by superstition and fable . <p> Zombies have no regard for keeping the Great Secret . They materialize ( from where ? I do n't know ) and begin their rampage for mortal flesh , literally mindless of the consequences . Vampires have been able to disguise zombie attacks as examples of deranged cannibals  --  Jeffrey Dahmer copycats . But eventually the zombies would make one attack too obvious to hide , and then humans would be on to all of us supernatural creatures . After that , we could only expect the methodical obliteration of the undead . <p> Therefore , all zombies must be exterminated . <p> Protecting the Great Secret is what I do for the Araneum . My day job is private detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do as a vampire enforcer . <p> " This your first zombie ? " Mel asked . <p> " Yeah . " <p> " How 'd he get the drop on you ? " <p> " I was stupid , " I replied . " After I laid him out with a shovel , I was going through his pockets . " <p> " Why did n't you decapitate him ? " <p> " I did . Right after that he shot from the ground , head in hands , and clamped onto me . Do n't let that walking corpse routine fool you , he 's got moves . " <p> The zombie found his head , picked it up , and stood . Strands of muddy drool hung from the lips and the neck stump . The dull eyes swiveled left and right and fixed upon a wooden surveyor 's stake pounded into the dirt . The zombie approached the stake and yanked it free . He worked the square end of the stake into the raw meat of the neck opening in his torso . Using both hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stake . He gave himself a rap on the top of his skull and the head squished tight into the collar of his shirt . <p> <br> Continues ...
