The widely used stress test , or treadmill test , may not be finely tuned enough to catch early heart disease , says a study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology . Researchers found that 56% of the more than 1,000 patients who passed a treadmill test , which measures how well the heart withstands exercise , scored above 100 on a follow-up screen for coronary calcium deposits . That puts them at elevated risk for a heart attack within five years . The study 's authors say at-risk patients  --  such as smokers , diabetics or those with high cholesterol or blood pressure  --  should get a coronary calcium scan , even if they ace their stress test .  --  By Sora Song
