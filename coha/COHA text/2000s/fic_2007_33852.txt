Preface On a cool spring night in Savannah , my mother is walking . Her clogs make sounds like horses ' hooves against the cobblestone street . She passes among banks of azaleas in full bloom and live oak trees shrouded in Spanish moss , and she enters a green square bordered by a caf . My father is seated on a stool at a wrought-iron table . Two chessboards spread across the table , and my father has castled on one when he looks up , sees my mother , and drops a pawn , which falls against the tabletop and rolls onto the sidewalk . My mother dips to pick up the chess piece and hands it back to him . She looks from him to the two other men sitting at the table . Their faces are expressionless . They 're tall and thin , all three , but my father has dark green eyes that somehow seem familiar . My father stretches out a hand and cups her chin . He looks into her pale blue eyes . " I know you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of her face , passing twice over the widow 's peak . Her hair is long and thick , russet brown , with small wisps that he tries to smooth away from her forehead . The other men at the table fold their arms , waiting . My father has been playing both of them simultaneously . My mother stares at my father 's face  --  dark hair falling awayfrom his forehead , straight dark eyebrows over those green eyes , lips thin but shaped in a cupid 's bow . Her smile is shy , frightened . He drops his hands , slides off the stool . They walk away together . The men at the table sigh , and clear the chessboards . Now they 'll have to play each other . " I 'm going to see Professor Morton , " my mother says . " Where 's his office ? " My mother waves her hand in the direction of the art college . He puts his hand on her shoulder , lightly , letting her lead . " What 's this ? A bug in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what seems to be an insect . " A barrette . " She takes the copper dragonfly from her hair and hands it to him . " It 's a dragonfly . Not a bug . " He shakes his head , then smiles . He says , " Hold still , " and carefully slides a lock of her hair through the dragonfly , then pins it behind her left ear . They turn away from the college . They 're holding hands now , walking down a steep cobblestone street . It 's growing dark and chilly , yet they pause to sit on a cement wall . My mother says , " This afternoon I sat at my window , watching the trees grow dark as the sun went down . I thought , I 'm growing older . I have only so many days left to watch the trees darken . Someone could count them . " He kisses her . It 's a brief kiss , a rough touching of lips . The second kiss lasts longer . She shivers . He bends to cover her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with small , quick brushes of his eyelashes . " Butterfly kisses , " he says , " to keep you warm . " My mother looks away , amazed at herself . In a matter of minutes she has let so much happen , without hesitation or protest . And she is n't stopping it now . She wonders how old he thinks she is . She 's sure she 's older  --  he looks about twenty-five , and she has recently turned thirty . She wonders when she should tell him that she 's married to Professor Morton . They stand up and walk on , down concrete steps leading toward the river . At the bottom of the steps is a closed cast-iron gate . " I hate moments like this , " my mother says . Her shoes ca n't climb gates . My father climbs over the gate and opens it . " It was n't locked , " he says . As she passes through , she has a sense of inevitability . She is moving toward something entirely new , yet predetermined . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being erased . They walk along the strand beside the river . Ahead they see the lights of the tourist shops , and as they reach them , he says , " Wait . " She watches him go inside a shop that sells Irish imports , then loses sight of him through the door 's wavy glass . He comes out carrying a soft wool shawl . He wraps it around her , and for the first time in years , she feels beautiful . Will we marry ? she wonders . But she does n't need to ask it . They walk on , a couple already . My father tells me this story , twice . I have questions . But I save them until he 's finished for the second time . " How did you know what she was thinking ? " is my first question . " Later she told me her thoughts , " he says . " What happened to Professor Morton ? " I ask next . " Did n't he try to stop her from leaving him ? " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty . I have long dark hair and blue eyes . Except for the eyes , I take after my father . " Professor Morton tried to keep your mother , " my father says . " He tried threats . He tried force . He 'd done it before , when she talked about leaving him . But this time she was in love , and she was n't afraid . She packed up her things and moved out . " " Did she move in with you ? " " Not at first . No , she took an apartment downtown near Colonial Cemetery , an apartment that some people still say is haunted . " I look hard at him , but I 'm not going to be distracted by the haunted apartment . " Who won the chess game ? " I ask . His eyes open wider . " That 's a very good question , Ariella , " he says . " I wish I knew the answer . " My father usually knows the answer to everything . " Could you tell she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't think about it . Age has never mattered much to me . " He stands up , goes to the living room window , draws the heavy velvet curtains . " Time for you to sleep , " he says . I have a hundred more questions . But I nod , I do n't object . Tonight he 's told me more than ever before about my mother , whom I 've never seen , and even more about himself . Except for one thing  --  the truth he does n't want to tell , the truth I 'll spend years trying to understand . The truth about who we really are .
