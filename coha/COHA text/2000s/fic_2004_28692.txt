Tabla 1 An Introduction to the Players LIKE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS Natalie and Consuelo were best friends since the second grade when the latter stuck a piece of ABC gum in the former 's hair while they were engaged in a fistfight over a boy whose name neither of them could remember . When Natalie had to cut her then waist-length hair up to a chin-length bob , Consuelo followed suit . Both girls realized at the early age of eight , a man is the last thing that ought to come between friends . On a Saturday night Consuelo called Natalie , not for any of the usual reasons , but to inform her that she had just killed a man . This scared Natalie even more than the time she was shoe-jacked by a mental ward escapee who made off with her favorite pair of black platform slides . Consuelo forwent the details , but implored Natalie to " come quick . " Natalie ran to her closet and pulled out her favorite dress , which was long and black with spaghetti straps , and her favorite sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw on a strand of faux pearls she had bought after watching Breakfast at Tiffany 's on late-night TV-trouble she normally would n't have gone to , but it was a Saturday night , and if it really was true , if Consuelo really had committed the crime she had spoken of over the telephone , then it was all the more reason why the girls ought to have a good time while they still could . On the way to Consuelo 's , Natalie considered herself lucky to have eight cylinders on her side . She had worked every summer between the second and ninth grades either picking or cutting apricots , and sometimes both , in order to earn enough money to buy the carof her dreams : a 1963 convertible Cadillac El Dorado . As she pulled into Roscoe 's to fill up , she was struck by a sense of pride and sentimentality . In that day and age as well as any other , a girl needed all the advantages she could get , and Natalie was happy to have a car that was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , responsive and powerful-characteristics she strived for in herself . With that sentiment in mind , she eased into the full-service island and said to the attendant , " I 'll take a tankful of Super Unleaded , and be sure to top it off , please . " Common sense and the movies told her that when two girls go on the lam , a full tank of gas is an essential starting point . The dust followed Natalie down the back roads while Eydie Gorme y Los Panchos hummed " Mala Noche " from the AM radio . When Natalie arrived , she was surprised to see Consuelo sitting on the wooden steps which led to her front porch , idly smoking a cigarette . Consuelo did not appear the least bit vexed , her composure failed to resemble that of a murderer or even a man slaughterer . With her long black hair parted down the middle and sectioned into two neat ponytails , she wore a white tank top and a pair of red terry cloth shorts . As Natalie approached Consuelo , she looked into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother insisted dwelt within , but all she saw were two mossy puddles . Consuelo claimed her mother was crazy , a point Natalie would n't argue against , but the fact is , most Mexicans do n't get green eyes , so when one does , it 's a big deal . Natalie remembered something Consuelo once told her . When Consuelo was four years old , she met her ta Concha for the first and only time . Taking the child 's chin in her hand , Concha looked into Consuelo 's eyes saying , " You only get one life , chica . Live it up . " With those words , claimed Consuelo , it was as if Concha had planted a seed within her , then , momentarily opening her up , she had shed sunlight and rainwater upon it , causing it to grow and grow , wrapping its vines around her innards , seeking its escape . Consuelo considered this her most formative moment . She would always remember her ta with a strange mixture of reverence and fear , as if Concha were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , and was so close to something so powerful and irresistible , it could not be overcome . It might have been completely coincidental , but Concha had single-handedly been responsible for the de-frocking of seven priests in her hometown of Culiacn , which is in the Mexican state of Sinaloa . A devout sinner , but a Catholic , Concha believed in confessing her sins as well as the other Sacraments . It might be relevant to mention , Concha also had green eyes . " Consuelo , " said Natalie taking a deep breath . " I got a whole tank of gas if you feel like gettin on out of here . " Consuelo took a long drag off her cigarette . Natalie scooped up the soft pack of mentholated Marlboros , removed one , and let it dangle from the corner of her mouth . A nonsmoker but a fidgeter , it gave her solace to have something to chew on . " I may have gotten you more worked up than the situation calls for , " said Consuelo . " Not to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ai n't probably nearly as bad as you 're thinkin . " " Give it to me straight and start from the beginnin , " said Natalie , tossing her long , naturally curly and naturally auburn hair . " Promise not to laugh ? " Consuelo began . Natalie crossed her fingers , held them up , and nodded , then sat down on the steps next to Sway . " A few days ago I decided to start exercisin . In case you have n't noticed , I 'm growin quite a gut and I just ca n't imagine givin up the finer things in life such as menudo or carne asada . " Consuelo pinched her abdomen and held it . " So , I figured I 'd start out slow . Maybe just walk around the block or somethin . It 's hard for a girl like me to know where to begin when it comes to a thing like physical fitness . For starters , I ai n't got no walkin shoes , so I put on my most comfortable pair . Member them suede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Think so , " said Nat . " Well I do n't own no sweats either , so I put on a pair of cutoffs and a T-shirt . No makeup mind you . You might say I was keepin a low profile . I 'm about to walk out the door when I start hearin the voices . " Consuelo scanned Natalie 's face for a reaction , seeing none , she continued . " You ever hear voices , Nat ? " " Not usually . Which is n't to say I have n't , because I have . Only mostly I do n't usually hear voices unless somebody 's talkin to me , and even then it 's questionable . " Consuelo moved closer to Natalie and lowered her voice . " Sometimes I hear voices , and usually it 's my momma that 's speakin . My ta Lila says it 's a gift , the voices that is , but I 'm not so sure about that . I 'm on my way out the door when I hear my momma as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' A girl dressed like you ca n't have no good intentions , you little sinvergenza . ' It shocks me , but only for a second , because it ai n't the first time I heard my momma say that , and it do n't matter that she 's gone to that other world either . " " Geez , Sway , that 's purty incredible and a bit creepy if you do n't mind my sayin so , " said Natalie . " Not in the least . The best things in life are just a little creepy , " said Consuelo . " I walk out the door and around the corner . Purty soon I notice this guy slowin down in his car to take a look , but I do n't pay him no mind because I 'm thinkin about all them calories I must be burnin . Plus I got my Jackie O shades on , which always makes me feel sorta protected . The eyes bein the windows to the soul and all , I prefer to keep the shades drawn . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world would be a better place if everybody did the same , " contributed Natalie . " Out of nowhere there 's a screechin of the brakes , and the next thing I know , there 's a dead man in the street , " said Sway . She bit her bottom lip , then elaborated , " There was this little old guy tryin to cross the street and he got himself runned over because some pervert was busy checkin out my nalgas . He was even usin the crosswalk . " Consuelo dropped her cigarette to the dirt , stretched out one of her long long legs , then extinguished the Marlboro with the wedge heel of her sandals . " That 's it , Sway ? " said Nat . " I 'm afraid so , " said Consuelo . " Were you expectin somethin more action-packed ? " " Oh , no , " said Natalie swatting at the air in front of her . " Well I hope you 're not feelin bad about it , because it ai n't by any means your fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girls sat silent for a moment staring off into the not so distant fields where a slight breeze rattled the pepper plants . " You know it 's funny , " said Nat . " People turn the wrong way down one-way streets all the time , but that do n't always spell disaster . " " No it do n't , " said Sway . She knew precisely what Nat meant : that the world was a place where anything could happen and everything did , and that even the most simple and well-intentioned acts could provoke disaster . " May the good Lord rest that poor man 's soul , but it 's Saturday night , and I was just wonderin , what 's the plan , chica ? " said Nat . " Was thinkin maybe we could head on out to the racetrack for some watch and wager horse racin , " said Consuelo . " You feelin all the sudden lucky ? " " Not hardly , but that ai n't never stopped me before . Wait on me while I go in and change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before you go , I just want you to know that you really scared me there for a second , " said Natalie waxing suddenly sentimental . " I figured you 'd be sent up and I 'd be lucky to see you maybe once or twice a year . And with your fear of public transportation and long car rides , you might go crazy on the bus ride over . It ai n't often a person runs into a like-minded individual , least not as like-minded as I consider you . " " Do n't worry about a thing , " said Consuelo . " I ai n't goin nowhere except to change , then we can hit the road . Chin up , chica , " Consuelo shouted as she ran up the steps and into the house . CONSUELO 'S DILEMMA Consuelo 's given name was Consuelo Constancia Gonzales Contreras until , when she was eighteen , she legally changed it to Consuelo Sin Vergenza . She had been told so many times that she was shameless , which is what sinvergenza means , that not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this alleged shamelessness her most admirable attribute . Her most practical problem in life was this : She was afraid of public transportation and long car rides . With Natalie behind the wheel , Consuelo could get into the Cadillac and go around the corner to the grocery store , or across town to the flea market . She could make it to bingo , to the baile , or anywhere else , just so long as it was within her thirty-mile travel zone . Why she was even known on occasion to hitchhike . But board a bus , never . Much less a train . Consuelo 's father , Don Pancho Macas Contreras ( Q.E.P.D./R.I.P. ) , was runned down by the midnight freight train from Guanajuato . He drove a white Chevrolet pickup truck he called El Caballo Blanco to which he sometimes sang the legendary song of the same name . Like any complex character , Don Pancho was filled with contradictions . He loved his wife , but not nearly as much as the collective charms of his many mistresses . Seven days a week he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gamble his money away . He was concerned with physical fitness , ran several kilometers a week , yet he undermined his health by drinking every night . To get right straight to the point , Don Pancho was a real parrandero-he liked to live it up drinking , dancing , womanizing , gambling , and barroom brawling . One evening , while on his way home from the cantina , Don Pancho forgot to cross himself as he passed the village church . He was sure this would bring bad luck , so he stopped quite literally in his tracks . ( The realization of his oversight occurred just as he attempted to cross the train tracks . ) Don Pancho put the Chevy in reverse , but it did n't wan na go backwards . He put it in first gear , but it did n't wan na go frontwards either . It did n't wan na go at all . DP did n't get out , pop the hood , and try to figure out what was the matter . Nor did he push-that truck was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed his mind , but he had heard enough corridos to know that a real man never leaves his horse , and while the only horse he 'd ever had he 'd lost in a poker game , he still considered his trusty white Chevy the next best thing . So instead of getting out of the saddle , he took off his sombrero , set it on the bench seat beside him , killed the engine , then began to sing . He sang " El Corrido del Caballo Blanco " over and over . Drunk as he was , it was n't long before he fell asleep . Nor was it long before the train swept him away . Back home , Don Pancho 's wife , Doa Luisa , was fast asleep in bed . In dreams Don Pancho came to her . " Forgive me , vieja , " he said with his sombrero in hand . " I always loved you more than any of the others . Leave me where I have fallen . I do n't deserve more . " Doa Luisa knew something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , and she understood every word of it . She also knew that her husband was gone for good , as opposed to just spending the night with another woman . So when the men showed up at her doorstep with Don Pancho 's lifeless body dangling over the back of a burro , Doa Luisa told them to take him back where they found him , and that he had wanted it that way , then she went back to sleep . Don Pancho might have been the father of her six children and the one on the way , but it 's hard for a woman to get all broken up over a man who spends most of his time and all of his money womanizing . And besides , Doa Luisa needed her rest . She was less than a month shy of her due date . Don Pancho had it his way . He was put under with little ceremonia in approximately the same spot where he had taken his last breath , but he really did n't know what he was getting himself into . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man buried in unsanctified ground without the benefit of a priest saying fancy words over his body is known as a tiradito , and some tiraditos can perform miracles .
