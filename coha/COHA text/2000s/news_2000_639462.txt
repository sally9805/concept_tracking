<p> There 's a weird disconnect about this year 's Oscar race . <p> On the one hand , those into Oscar prognostications are excited about how close and open a competition there should be this year , with arty or uncompromisingly realistic films such as ' Boys Do n't Cry , ' ' The Straight Story , ' ' Being John Malkovich , ' ' The Insider , ' ' The End of the Affair , ' ' Topsy-Turvy , ' ' Magnolia ' and ' Election ' all in the running for major awards . <p> On the other hand , the public is flocking to ' Stuart Little ' and ' Fantasia/2000 , ' or seeing ' Toy Story 2 ' for the fifth time . <p> With the exception of ' American Beauty , ' none of the Oscar-worthy , critically honored 1999 films also has excited the general public , as did last year 's ' Saving Private Ryan ' or ' Shakespeare in Love . ' ( That may change as ' The Hurricane ' and ' Topsy-Turvy , ' two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance lauded <p> And even while everyone who sees ' Beauty ' raves about Kevin Spacey 's performance , quite a few resist its stylistic experimentalism and darkly comic ravaging of the suburban dream . <p> Still , it is the front-runner for best picture . Spacey , Annette Bening , director Sam Mendes , writer Alan Ball and cinematographer Conrad Hall all are likely nominees , and some in the supporting cast could also get nods . Oscar nominations will be announced Feb. 15 ; the Oscars are awarded March 26 . <p> Based on end-of-the-year critics ' awards as well as Golden Globe nominations , another movie headed for multiple Oscar nominations is ' The Insider , ' director Michael Mann 's study of a tobacco-company whistle-blower 's personal travails . <p> Mann turned what could have been a dry legal drama into an intimate , involving character study - one that is visually inventive , too . This is a movie that people should see , although they 're not , and members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences probably will use their Oscar nominations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked movie . <p> And ' The Talented Mr. Ripley , ' which slowly seems to be finding an audience despite ( or maybe because of ) its prickly , understated approach to suspense-movie storytelling , looks headed for major nominations . <p> Evocative or dated ? <p> Whenever a movie is set in the recent past , it 's always dicey whether audiences will find it evocative or dated . People seem to like ' Ripley 's ' re-creation of late-1950s Italy , as well as its resurrection of that most unsentimental of mystery writers , Patricia Highsmith . It probably will get best-picture and best-director nominations ( for Anthony Minghella ) , as well as a supporting-actor one for Jude Law . But the academy may pass on Matt Damon 's problematic portrayal of Ripley . <p> In general , the problem for 1999-released movies was an inability to lure adults , on a mass scale , to those with traditionally Oscar-worthy ' serious ' subject matter . Television got that audience instead - witness ' The Sopranos . ' Also , the old formulas for quality , escapist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna and the King ' or ' Man on the Moon . ' <p> What did seem to work well were family-oriented movies for or about kids , from the supernatural ' The Sixth Sense ' to the cleverly animated ' Toy Story 2 . ' There could be Oscar nominations for these - especially ' Sixth Sense 's ' Haley Joel Osment - but probably not for best picture . <p> And it will be interesting to see if there 's a best-song Oscar nomination for ' South Park : Bigger , Longer &; Uncut 's ' ' Blame Canada . ' Critics have liked this R-rated animated raspberry at the movie-rating system ; some in Hollywood hate it . <p> There is a hit movie that the public thinks is artistic , serious-minded and Oscar-worthy - ' The Green Mile . ' However , critics ' groups have snubbed it as being indefensibly long for such a simple moral fable . <p> Opposition runs deep - many find it puffed-up hokum . Even the populist Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave it just one major Golden Globe nomination , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given Sunday . ) <p> Still , this movie has the power of the people behind it , as well as the reputations of star Tom Hanks and director Frank Darabont ( ' The Shawshank Redemption ' ) . <p> A key tipoff to its fate comes Monday , when the Directors Guild of America nominations are announced . If Darabont 's fellow directors find ' Green Mile ' worthy of his past work , Oscar nominators probably will , too . But whatever the scenario , it just is n't his best work . <p> If there is a stealth candidate , it is British director Mike Leigh 's ' Topsy-Turvy , ' a moving and funny ( and very long ) portrait of the process by which Gilbert &; Sullivan created their opera ' The Mikado . ' The Golden Globes snubbed it , but critics have loved it - it tied with ' Being John Malkovich ' as the National Society of Film Critics ' best film . <p> Although it 's opening very slowly across the country ( it does n't get to Denver until Jan. 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' Shakespeare in Love . ' There is a very good chance it could get picture , director and screenplay nominations , as well as one for Jim Broadbent 's performance as lyricist William S. Gilbert . <p> Another top candidate is Spike Jonze 's ' Being John Malkovich , ' which represents the surreal and funny ( but still poignant ) side of the new , edgy filmmaking . Even if it does n't get a best-picture or director nomination , writer Charlie Kaufman seems assured of one for his inventive screenplay . But will Malkovich himself get nominated in the supporting-actor category ? <p> On the other hand , Paul Thomas Anderson 's ' Magnolia ' probably is too edgy - and flawed - for much recognition , despite the exciting way it works when it does work , which is often . But Tom Cruise 's fiery performance looks to be recognized , and maybe Aimee Mann 's songs , too . <p> Other movies with best-picture chances are ' The Straight Story , ' ' Boys Do n't Cry , ' ' The End of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And while Denzel Washington is a cinch to be nominated for his portrayal of Rubin ' Hurricane ' Carter in ' The Hurricane , ' the film could also get numerous major nods as a way of honoring veteran director Norman Jewison . On the other hand , it could also be neglected amid complaints it distorts or overlooks facts in its telling of a ' true story . ' <p> So keeping all this in mind , here are this critic 's guesses at the best candidates for nominations in key Oscar categories besides best picture : <p> Best actress : ' Boys Do n't Cry 's ' Hilary Swank , ' Tumbleweeds " Janet McTeer , ' American Beauty 's ' Annette Bening , ' Election 's ' Reese Witherspoon , ' The End of the Affair 's ' Julianne Moore , ' Music of the Heart 's ' Meryl Streep , ' Mansfield Park 's ' Frances O'Connor . <p> Best actor : ' The Hurricane 's ' Denzel Washington , ' The Straight Story 's ' Richard Farnsworth , ' American Beauty 's ' Kevin Spacey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' Jim Broadbent , ' Sweet and Lowdown 's ' Sean Penn , ' The End of the Affair 's ' Ralph Fiennes . <p> Best supporting actor : ' The Talented Mr. Ripley 's ' Jude Law and Philip Seymour Hoffman , ' Being John Malkovich 's ' John Malkovich , ' American Beauty 's ' Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper , ' The Cider House Rules " Michael Caine and Delroy Lindo , ' The Sixth Sense 's ' Haley Joel Osment , ' Magnolia 's ' Tom Cruise , Jason Robards , John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman , ' The Insider 's ' Christopher Plummer . <p> Best supporting actress : ' Boys Do n't Cry 's ' Chloe Sevigny , ' Tumbleweeds " Kimberly J. Brown , ' Anywhere But Here 's ' Natalie Portman , ' Guinevere 's ' Jean Smart , ' Cradle Will Rock 's ' Cherry Jones , ' Girl , Interrupted 's ' Angelina Jolie , ' An Ideal Husband 's ' Julianne Moore , ' Sweet and Lowdown 's ' Samantha Morton , ' The Sixth Sense 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine Keener . <p> Best director : ' American Beauty 's ' Sam Mendes , ' The Insider 's ' Michael Mann , ' The Talented Mr. Ripley 's ' Anthony Minghella , ' Topsy-Turvy 's ' Mike Leigh , ' The Straight Story 's ' David Lynch , ' The Green Mile 's ' Frank Darabont , ' The Hurricane 's ' Norman Jewison , ' Being John Malkovich 's ' Spike Jonze , ' All About My Mother 's ' Pedro Almodovar . <p> By the way , watch the foreign-language nominations - there could be an American film in them , Tony Bui 's Vietnamese-language ' Three Seasons .
