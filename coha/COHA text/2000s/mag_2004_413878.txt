A backwoods town became the center of a religiously inspired crusade against Brazil 's new republican government that ultimately cost 30,000 lives .

" Its nature and symbolism still resonate more than a century later , as evidenced by the worldwide bestselling book of the same name by Mario Vargas Llosa , based on the religious utopia 's fight against authority that took place at the town of Canudos . The origins of this epic tragedy lie in the mountain range of incomprehension that separated Brazil 's emerging republicanism and its deeply rooted medieval Christian monarchism . Seven years prior to the Canudos campaign , elements of the army escorted Brazil 's last emperor , Dom Pedro II de Alcantara , to a waiting ship , packed him off to Europe and declared the nation a republic . It had taken almost a century for the elite European Brazilians living along the Atlantic coast to embrace the French model , born of the Enlightenment . Such was not the case , however , in the economically depressed back country , the sertoes . The vast hinterland of Brazil , like that of peasant Russia , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious and ruthless , modest and daring . Several pro-monarchist rebellions broke out against the new order . All of them became footnotes in history except the one at Canudos in the state of Bahia , where the rebels regarded themselves as fervent religious crusaders . THE LEADER OF THIS BACKLANDS uprising was a mystic ascetic named Antonio Vincente Mendes Maciel , though everyone called him Conselheiro , the Counselor . He was a messianic figure of great charisma who for years wandered about the countryside repairing churches and shrines , feeding the poor and preaching an apocalyptic brand of Catholicism . By the time of Dom Pedro 's departure , the Counselor had thousands of followers . The secular republic with its new taxes , civil marriages and religious freedoms became the target of the Counselor 's sermons . In at least one town he passed through in 1893 , a bulletin board that displayed the republic 's latest decrees and tax laws was burned . When the state of Bahia sent 30 militiamen against what it thought was an anarchist mob , they were routed by outraged townsfolk armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools . It was the first of many victories for this army of believers . By 1895 the Counselor had settled upon the town of Canudos , in the desert outback region , about 220 miles from the coast in northeastern Brazil , as the focus of his spiritual efforts . This area is not a part of Brazil 's Amazon jungle , but a scrub desert with thorny flora called caatingas . The Counselor 's followers came from all over the dry interior county to build primitive one- and two-room windowless mud huts to be near their leader . Among the Counselors new followers were gangs of backlands bandits who submitted to his spiritual authority . Skilled in arms and ambush , these religious ruffians , known collectively as jaguncos ( landless peasants ) , visited neighboring towns to procure supplies and money . The faithful gave willingly . But when a contractual dispute arose with a businessman in Juazeiro , 125 miles north of Canudos , the local magistrate , fearing the Counselor 's wrath , called to Bahia 's state capital , Salvador , for help . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of 104 men commanded by Lieutenant Manuel da Silva Pires Ferreira to end the depredations of the jaguncos . Taking the train from the coast , the little expedition arrived in Juazeiro on November 7 , 1896 . Organization and procurement of supplies occupied the force until the 12th . After seven days of marching in the heat of the subequatorial November-to-March summer , the small force arrived exhausted at Uaua , a market village of perhaps 100 mud huts defined by two dirt cross streets . The troops encamped in the village square with guards posted at its edges while the officers debated the best way to approach Canudos , now only a half day 's march away .

At dawn about 1,000 jaguncos approached Uaua , praying and singing like a ghostly apparition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . Their fervent charge with vivas to the " Good Jesus " and " the Counselor " overran the pickets and rushed upon Ferreira 's main body . The soldiers retreated to empty houses and laid on a withering return fire with their modern , Belgian-made Comblain rifles . The jaguncos , with their clumsy shotguns and ancient muskets , took heavy casualties . After a four-hour fight the rebels retreated , leaving behind as many as 150 dead . But with 10 men dead and 16 wounded out of the 104 who had set out from the coast , Ferreira 's " victory " left him with too few troops to take the fight to the enemy . After burying his dead , he withdrew . Four days later the exhausted soldiers limped back into Juazeiro , their uniforms in tatters . Citizens panicked and prepared to flee , while locomotives with their burners stoked stood in readiness . JUST AS TELEVISION CONVEYED instant news of the Vietnam War to the United States in the 1960s , the telegraph gave Brazilians daily ( if censored ) reports of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated a modern fighting force , the government in Rio de Janeiro assembled a larger expedition of 543 federal troops and Bahian state police , including 14 officers and three surgeons , in early December . They took with them two 7.5-inch Krupp field cannons , as well as two Nodenfeldt machine guns . Commanded by Major Febronio de Brito , the expedition began its march from the railhead at Queimadas , 75 miles south of Canudos , but lacked sufficient transport for its supplies and munitions . Most provisions had to be left at Queimadas , and more supplies were cached at Monte Santo , the halfway point to Canudos . The force was divided into three columns of infantry and supporting detachments , but there was no organized deployment of units or precaution against ambush . After resting two weeks at Monte Santo while vainly waiting for supplies to be brought forward , the republican troops proceeded on their mission . From then on their steps were dogged day and night by jaguncos who fired and fled , resulting in casualties and frayed nerves . Slowed down by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sands and torturing rocks , the expedition approached to within five miles of Canudos . The troops were almost out of water and supplies . The last two oxen were slaughtered for food . Their guides , never trustworthy to begin with , abandoned them . As the republicans advanced on the rebel city , they finally met organized resistance , led by one of the Counselor 's many African-Brazilian converts , a former bandit leader nicknamed " Big Joao . " Supported by cannon and machine gun fire , the republicans charged up the last hill between them and Canudos . Following savage fighting , they secured it and reported killing 115 of the rebels while losing only four dead and 20 wounded . After resting for the night , the republicans resumed their march the next morning . They were in sight of the church spires of Canudos when masses of peasants , many unarmed , counterattacked . Dozens of jaguncos were mowed down by rifle fire , but the rest kept coming , tearing into the republicans ' line and momentarily capturing their guns .

The soldiers had inflicted hundreds of casualties upon the religious fanatics , but they had no water and no supplies . There were only 20 shells left for their cannons , with no hope of resupply or reinforcements . For the second time , a Brazilian military force ( not counting the militia ) retreated , pursued by another bandit leader named Pajehu . This fierce fighter was a Cafuso , half Indian-half African , with a reputation for cruelty . Retreating over 60 miles of empty desert , the soldiers were harassed by Pajehu and his men , who hurled stones from the heights commanding their escape route at Bendego de Baixo . Stragglers were as good as dead . Only the machine guns kept the guerrillas at bay . It was not an army that arrived back at Monte Santo but a horde of weaponless , beaten men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the government finally began to stir . Now a determined regiment of battle-hardened veterans would be sent to subdue the rebels . Colonel Antonio Moreira Cesar was an unlikely soldier , of short stature , with bowed legs and slight shoulders . In border skirmishes with Paraguay and minor rebellions , however , he had earned such nicknames as " Throat Slasher , " " Ground Trembler " and " Beheader . " His reputation for efficiency and brutality preceded him to the sertoes , where the Counselor 's followers began to doubt their own abilities . Then , too , Cesar moved with unexpected speed . Five days after leaving Rio de Janeiro he was in Queimadas with 1,300 men , millions of rounds of ammunition and four Krupp fieldpieces with 70 shells . On the day before they were due to depart Monte Santo , Cesar assembled and reviewed the entire corps , then ordered his veteran troops to march on Canudos-a day ahead of schedule In spite of his ruthless daring , Cesar had an Achilles heel . Twice on the 60-mile march he suffered an epileptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two expeditions , the third was plagued by supply problems . Worse , the rebels had practiced a scorched-earth policy , burning haciendas and poisoning wells . Cesar 's overconfident army left Monte Santo with only canteens . Cesar had also brought along an artesian pump to provide water during the march , but instead of a pile driver , he had brought an ineffectual windlass . That mistake necessitated an additional 15-mile forced march in search of water . Nighttime brought only a brief rest , but the growing thirst of the expedition was slaked by a sudden downpour . As the troops neared Canudos , snipers ambushed them , killing half a dozen before being repulsed by machine guns and cavalry . Having rejoined the army after his seizures , Cesar announced their little victory was a good omen . Handed a captured fowling piece , the colonel discharged it into the air , contemptuously remarking , " These people are unarmed . " Marching at a double-quick pace , on March 3 , 1897 , the troops came within 3 miles of the religious settlement . Cesar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacking , but he changed it on a whim , giving his men only 15 minutes off their feet . " We will have breakfast in Canudos ! " he boldly assured them . Photograph Set up in the relative safety of a gully in July 1897 , the fourth expedition 's impromptu medical facility outside Canudos soon filled with casualties , earning it the sobriquet Hospital de Sangue ( Hospital of Blood ) . // HALTING LESS THAN TWO MILES from the city , he ordered two of his guns unlimbered and two rounds fired toward Canudos . " There go a couple of visiting cards for the Counselor , " he casually remarked . At last , climbing the rise known as Alto de Favela , the soldiers spied what the first two expeditions had not : Canudos . The second largest city in Bahia at that time , its population had grown in two years from just over 4,000 to an estimated 30,000 , living in some 5,000 mud and thatch-roofed huts . Canudos was nestled in a valley next to a winding seasonal stream called Rio Vasa-Barris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first rains . The troops also could see two churches amid the sea of unpainted adobe shacks . The old church had been a part of the town for years . The new church , brainchild of the Counselor , was still under construction . The army 's vanguard arrived on Favela , and the artillery was brought into line . The pitiful mud huts shattered as the guns opened fire . Between shots the bell of the old church could be heard ringing out , calling the city to arms . Cesar 's men formed ranks on either side of the firing cannons , and 800 bayonets gleamed in the sun as they advanced on opposite ends of the town in a classic pincer movement . The rebels had not yet returned fire , prompting the colonel to assert that he would take the town without firing another shot . Cesar had not bothered to scout ahead , however . His right wing advanced over gently sloping ground , and the Rio Vasa-Barris offered an even bed with low banks . But the left wing had to traverse more torturous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack to slow , and as they entered the city , the troops had broken up into small groups . The rebels at last opened fire from lofts in the two churches . Most were still armed with muskets , shotguns and old blunderbusses that could be ( and were ) loaded with pebbles or nails as shot . But at least a few of the snipers wielded rifles captured from earlier expeditions . Between the two churches was an open square , but beyond it the thousands of mud huts created a bewildering maze . As the disorganized army disappeared into the smoke-shrouded town , the cannons were silenced for fear of hitting the troops . Units got smaller as each alley and hut lured individual soldiers to pillage and seek the breakfast their colonel had promised-only to be attacked as rebels emerged from hiding in cramped spaces where the soldiers ' rifles could not be brought to bear . Even the women lashed out with kitchen knives and fingernails . From his vantage point on Favela , Colonel Cesar was feeling uneasy about the smoke-shrouded scene before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cavalry troop came up he immediately sent them into battle . But the horses-as tired as the men-balked at water 's edge , refusing to take the steep slopes or enter the inferno of whizzing bullets and burning huts . As they struggled on the left flank , the police were slowed by an unseen deep gully in midstream . Cesar called for his horse , remarking , " I am going to put a little mettle into those fellows . " He got about halfway down the slope , waving his saber , when he was shot in the abdomen by a marksman from one of the churches . As his staff rushed to bring him to safety , a second bullet struck him . Command passed to Colonel Pedro Nunes Tamarindo . A usually jovial man of about 60 , he had been looking forward to a peaceful retirement when he was assigned to Cesar 's expedition . Occupied with extricating his own battalion from the morass of Canudos , Tamarindo was little prepared for overall command . After five hours of fierce fighting , darkness fell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob , fled the town under fire . At that moment of victory the jaguncos heard the old church 's bell ring . They paused for prayer , and the sound of the Ave Maria floated over the panicked enemy .

" // On top of Favela , officers gathered beside their dying colonel and argued for retreat . Cesar refused to hear of it , but he was largely ignored . Meanwhile the new commander , smoking his pipe and talking to himself , did little to bring order to his beleaguered army . At dawn the regiment 's retreat began . Harassed by vengeful bandits , it quickly became a rout . Tamarindo was mortally wounded during the retreat , soon joining Cesar in death .

Stripping off their uniforms , the soldiers made their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arsenal of discarded Comblain and newer Mannlicher rifles , along with thousands of rounds of ammunition . ONCE AGAIN THE telegraph spread the news of defeat . An astonished Brazilian public wondered how a peasant band of religious fanatics could defeat a modern army . Were the British or the North Americans supplying and organizing them ? Was it a monarchist plot to overthrow the republic ? Civilians enlisted out of patriotism or were forcibly conscripted to put an end to this counterrevolution . It took three months to assemble a new army at Salvador before the fourth expedition was ready to march , commanded by Brig . Gen. Artur Oscar de Andrade Guimaraes , another republican loyalist . In June 1897 , Oscar 's troops force-marched in two separate columns toward Canudos . This time army engineers prepared a road for the wagons and cannons , which included a 2-ton Whitworth 32 siege gun . The first column , under General Oscar 's personal command , comprised 1,933 men . Brigadier General Claudio de Amaral Savaget led the second column of 2,350 men . Like Cesar , Oscar marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers prepared a grisly welcome for him . Along the line of march , hung from trees and bushes , were the rotting corpses , bleached skulls and tattered uniforms of the Cesar expedition . From then on , no quarter was given or asked-any man taken prisoner by either side could expect to have his throat slit . Oscar 's column soon found itself dangerously spread out . The bulk of the force was far in advance of the slow-moving Whitworth gun , which was followed in turn by the supply train . Ten miles separated the van from the rear . As the army approached Canudos the crafty Pajehu and his jaguncos sniped at its flank . When at last Oscar and his men reached Favela , the rebels poured on a punishing fire from hidden locations all around . Pajehu had herded the army into a trap . By day 's end 75 troops had been killed or wounded , and the rest were cut off from their supplies . Things seemed to go better for Savaget 's column , whose men marched 175 miles from the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column was divided into three brigades , each with its own supply train , marching independently but within supporting distance of one another . Some of the recruits were gauchos , the cowboys of the southern Brazilian plains , scouting and foraging as irregular cavalry . Savaget 's line of march led to a series of steep ravines and slopes at a place called Cocorobo . The gauchos , probing ahead , discovered a trap that was awaiting them . The army would have had to pass through a narrow gorge with surrounding hills where the jaguncos had dug in , waiting in ambush . Photograph Flavio de Barras photographed the 300 women and children who emerged from the rubble of Canudos to surrender on October 2. // The column formed up into battalions and began firing into the hills , receiving heavy and accurate fire in return . After three hours of shooting without a single target sighted , but with mounting casualties , Savaget had to make a decision . He could retreat , try to flank the position or charge the unseen foe . He reformed his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side of the pass while the gauchos galloped through the narrow passage to outmaneuver the enemy . It worked . By the end of the day , the troops carried Cocorobo and camped on the other side , where they buried their 27 dead and tended the 151 wounded , including Savaget . The remaining eight miles to the outskirts of Canudos cost him 40 more dead and 108 wounded . As they came in sight of the enemy stronghold , Savaget s men could hear the first column shelling the town two miles away . Like their predecessors , they were confident of victory-until messengers arrived from General Oscar asking for immediate relief from his predicament . Savaget , though wounded , quickly moved all of his troops to his commander 's rescue . The result was that the entire expeditionary force was under siege by an unseen enemy who was picking soldiers off one by one . By nightfall more than 4,000 men hugged the ground , while 900 others lay dead or wounded . Mingled among them , nearly 1,000 cavalry and draft horses tramped about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up , but less than half of it had made it through the encircling jaguncos , who captured as many as half a million rifle cartridges . The next day , June 28 , the 17 field guns and the Whitworth opened up on Canudos , but to no effect . Meanwhile , the army realized that it was low on provisions . Some officers argued for an immediate attack on the town , but Oscar overruled them , choosing to wait for the promised resupply . But no supply train was coming . The isolated and surrounded army dug in as best it could to fend off the fierce attacks of the wily backlanders . An impromptu hospital was set up in a gully that was relatively safe from the bullets buzzing overhead . It would remain for the next four months and became known as the Hospital de Sangue , the Hospital of Blood . By July 2 , provisions consisted of little more than flour and salt . By July 7 , the wounded were no longer given rations at all , forced to rely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out . Informal foraging parties searched for wild goats or cattle . Some food was brought in this way , particularly by the gauchos , but many of the foragers were never seen again . On July 13 a supply train brought some relief , but also news that no coordinated effort existed to get reinforcements or more supplies to the front . The army on hand must either attack or retreat . Oscar , unable to abide giving up the ground he had gained , decided to launch a general assault on the 18th . The still-ailing Savaget was left in charge of the base camp with 1,500 troops , the artillery , dwindling stores and the wounded . More than 3,000 other soldiers assembled on the right and then , crossing the dry bed of the Vasa-Barris , wheeled left toward the two churches in the center of Canudos . At first the soldiers ' march was unopposed , but as soon as they crossed the riverbed they came under a withering fire . On the far bank all semblance of order began to disintegrate as units became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravines that angled off from the waterless river . At last they reached the edge of the square and hugged the outer wall of the old church , but could go no farther . In the course of the four-hour assault they had suffered 947 casualties and were pinned down . With the coming darkness the bell of the old church began to toll and again the Ave Maria prayer floated over the tortured cries of the wounded . The next day the soldiers took stock of their Pyrrhic victory . Once again in a snare of his own making , General Oscar stubbornly held on to his positions and desperately called for reinforcements . Messengers who escaped the ring of death told of the inferno at Canudos , and once again the telegraph sent out the horrible news of a modern army crushed by a ragtag bunch of peasants . But what really told the tale was the demoralized hundreds of wounded soldiers who came straggling out of the barren caatingas . On July 31 , a reinforcement brigade of 1,200 men formed up at Queimadas . It had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became sick and a colonel took charge . By the time it reached the forward base of Monte Santo , it would be commanded by a major . Smallpox swept through its ranks , sending men to the rear . As it entered the danger zone the column was attacked by jaguncos . It was a diversionary raid on green troops-supplies were the guerrillas ' main objective . Of 102 oxen being escorted to the army at Canudos , 91 were spirited away by the rebels . When the new brigade limped into the line its effective strength had fallen by 200 . The government put aside its other concerns and resolved to crush the seemingly unstoppable backlands rebellion . In addition to fresh troops , it now dispatched the secretary of war , Marshal Carlos Machado de Bittencourt . Bittencourt was an unlikely hero . He was without personal ambition and seemed to care nothing about the welfare of the wounded . He was exactly the man who was needed for the task of subduing rebels in the middle of a wasteland . Unlike any of his predecessors , Bittencourt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals . Before long , caravans of food , munitions and medicines , along with ever greater manpower , started to move toward Canudos . With the arrival of additional men and supplies , General Oscar began new offensive operations . The Whitworth was moved forward to bombard the two churches from whose towers sharpshooters had decimated his army . On August 24 , the bell tower of the old church fell . But it was the last hurrah for the Whitworth . Its breech jammed , and the powerful gun ceased firing . Despite the loss of the mighty cannon , the tide had turned . More soldiers and supplies arrived while jaguncos died without replacements . The siege expanded until Canudos was completely cut off from the outside . On September 6 , artillery fire brought down the towers of the new church , depriving the Counselor 's marksmen of their last commanding view . During all of that time the Counselor himself had led the people in prayer and delivered his unique and compelling sermons , but he was growing physically weaker every day and cut short his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably of dysentery . The fact was kept hushed up . He was not buried for several days because of his prophecy that he , like Christ , would rise again . But when his body began decomposing , he was at last laid to rest in a secret spot . The noose continued to tighten around the doomed defenders as they died or deserted . No quarter had been given or asked on either side , so most of the rebels fought on , without food , without water and without medical care . On October 1 , the resupplied and reinforced army of more than 5,000 began its final assault , suffering another 567 casualties to secure the miserable city . The next day 300 women and children , phantoms of skin and bones , wide-eyed from hunger and fear , emerged from the rubble to give themselves up . But the men would not . On October 5 , the last four defenders died fighting . The rest of Brazil felt great relief at the end of the carnage , as did the army itself . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of between 25,000 and 35,000 of Canudos ' residents had died . At least 5,000 soldiers were killed , wounded or missing . The Counselor 's body was found and exhumed . His head was severed for " study " at the university in Salvador of his deviant behavior , but was lost several years later when the building in which it was housed burned down . In his preaching the Counselor predicted that " the sertoes will become sea and the sea will become sertoes . " Ironically , during the late 1960s the Cocorbo Dam , built on the Rio Vasa-Barris , flooded the site . Only in the psyche of modern Brazil does Canudos remain a haunting symbol of pious resistance to authority .
