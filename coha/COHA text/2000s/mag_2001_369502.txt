Let 's say the countries in southern Africa finally mobilize the political will to take on AIDS . If they are able to use only their own money , these countries will be forced to write off those who are already infected . The best they can do is try to slow new cases through preventive education and encouraging condom use , maybe reduce transmission from mothers to babies . Hardly enough to save a continent . So figuring out how to save the millions who are infected remains an agonizing challenge . <P> Life-extending drugs are out there . Wealthy countries use multidrug-cocktail therapies that transform AIDS from certain killer to chronic illness and reduce its spread by making the infected less contagious . The people you just read about could stop dying if they too had access to the drugs . <P> Despite years of evidence of AIDS ' genocidal toll on poor countries , no one has brought these drugs within reach of ordinary Africans . In fact , the people who make the drugs  --  American- and European-owned multinational pharmaceutical corporations  --  and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep prices up by limiting exports to the Third World and vigorously enforcing patent rights . They argue that drug firms legitimately need the profits to finance research on new wonder drugs . They say it 's not wise to offer cheap AIDS drugs without a proper medical infrastructure  --  that deadly , drug-resistant strains would emerge . But at what point does the human benefit to desperate , destitute countries outweigh strict adherence to patents and profits ? <P> During the tug of war so far , the pharmaceuticals and Western governments have prevailed . But increasingly , poor countries and AIDS advocates are finding ways to shift the balance . India and Brazil have vigorously exploited a time lag until international patent rules apply to them , manufacturing copies of AIDS drugs and selling them at deeply discounted prices . The practice opens the door for other countries to follow suit by taking advantage of a legal loophole in global-trade rules called compulsory licensing . In effect , it lets countries breach patents during national emergencies to manufacture generic versions of AIDS drugs . So a virtually identical version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $15,000 a year in the U.S. costs $3,000 in Brazil and less than $1,000 in India . And when Brazil decided to provide the generic drugs free to all its AIDS victims , it disproved the argument that poor countries could n't master the complex regime of AIDS pills . The government set up effective clinics , and reports indicate that Brazilian patients take their medicine as meticulously as American AIDS sufferers do . <P> The pharmaceutical firms see local manufacture and so-called parallel imports  --  where other countries buy the copycat generics instead of the brand name  --  as a threat they are battling to wipe out . They feel that they alone should not have to pick up the tab for Africa . They want to stanch drug pirates who might make worthless fakes or flood drugs onto the black market . And they fear that making AIDS therapies cheaper for Africans will prompt lucrative Western markets to demand lower prices as well .
