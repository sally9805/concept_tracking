Chapter One The diesel cloud enveloped Will as the truck driver pulled away from the intersection . He stood on the side of a dark two-lane highway with all of his earthly possessions crammed into a road-worn backpack , deciding which direction to take . Heart warred with head , his good sense telling him not to venture down this road . It had been paved with good times on his previous visit ; why take a chance on ruining it ? But he 'd been pulled across the miles by the innocent and secure memories engraved during the one care-free summer of his youth . How he longed for the simple comfort of familiar surroundings , of childhood dreams yet to be born , and to be , even for the briefest time , away from the ugliness that stained his adult world . The shroud of exhaust cleared , and there before him was the sign : GLENS CROSSING 4 MI . Will looked at the red tail-lights of the truck receding into the night , then in the direction of the town . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide in the morning . Tonight , painful thoughts of his current situation made it far too easy to crawl back into the past . The darkness had a way of distorting both past and present , making them more hideous and more marvelous than they actually were . In the light , he could see things more clearly - the horror of the last months less pronounced , the delights of the one wonderful summer less remarkable . He walked a good part of the way toward the town . His aching feet told him he 'd covered over two miles , when it caught his eye . There , across the wide open expanse of a bean field , rose the lighted spokes of a Ferris wheel . A harvest moon , so large and low in the sky that it appeared to be painted on the black of night , sat on the horizon , seemingly side by side with the carnival ride . A filmy haze sent three gray fingers across the enormous golden disk . One of those fingers appeared crooked and beckoning . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neck prickled and rose as the skin at the base of his skull tightened . Had he been thirty minutes later , that moon would have been up in the sky where it belonged , away from the thin clouds , the inviting golden light brightened to cold blue-white . Instead of being calmed by the thought of divine intervention , he sighed heavily with the weight of too many miles , too many memories . He closed his eyes briefly and told himself , once again , to wait . Tomorrow . A word which had for the past four months become his mantra . He glanced around , looking for a good place to bed down for the night , and heard the steady thrum of a sub-woofer pounding ever nearer . A long minute passed before he saw the headlights of the car . It sped past him , the reverberation from the speakers battering him in the chest . He watched it pass , wondering how the hearing of the car 's occupant could ever recover . Immediately , the brake lights brightened and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tires stopped rolling forward , adding a squeal to the bass and the smell of burnt rubber to the air . The car stopped in front of him , nearly rolling over his toes . The tinted window came down and a girl in her late teens leaned across the passenger seat . For a moment his heart skipped a beat . If he did n't know she was dead , he 'd have sworn he was looking at his sister , Jenny - same shoulder-length brown hair , same tilt to the green eyes . Then the girl smiled and the eerie similarity disappeared , the smile too wide , the lips too full . " Need a ride ? " He started to tell her no , when she added , " I 'm just going to the carnival , but I can give you a lift that far . " The carnival . The Ferris wheel . Well , damn , he did n't have to be hit over the head to get the picture . He was destined to walk the streets of Glens Crossing once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garish lights that flashed against the pitch black sky . Blue , red and green bare bulbs , strung like gypsy baubles , broke the darkness overhead , washing out the stars . Leigh Mitchell watched the brightly lit spokes of the Ferris wheel revolve , feeling once again that life in Henderson County had n't changed much since she was five years old . This year the dust puffed a bit higher underfoot and the flat , dry odor of dead grass was stronger because of the drought . But the carnival , as most every other social landmark , remained essentially unaltered from season to season , year to year , decade to decade . It was the last fling of summer ; the boisterous , colorful boundary between seasons . Trampled grass beneath her tennis shoes , the tempting aroma of grilling sausage and green peppers , sticky cotton candy on smiling cherub faces , hard-won stuffed animals wrapped in teenagers ' arms - all the same as last year , and the year before , and the year before that . Glens Crossing was a town where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much cast when your birth certificate registered the north or south side of the tracks that bisected town . Where expectations were strong and habitually met . Here , your secrets were never your own . She guessed that , in a nutshell , could be pegged as the crux of her discontent . Her place in this town had been carved long before adulthood . She 'd been " the Mitchell girl " - the responsible one , the one who had to grow up early because her parents were gone , the one teachers could count on to follow the rules and go above and beyond in the classroom , the one adults smiled at when passing on the street , the one invisible to her classmates . No one ever looked her way when mischief had been done - would n't even consider the possibility that Leigh Mitchell had strayed outside the realm of good behavior . Nothing had changed in the past twenty-three years . A pack of giggling teenage girls bumped her as they hurried by , calling a quick and insincere apology over their shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts and moved on through the crowd . She nodded as she passed Mr. Grissom of local UFO fame . Beside him , his tiny , mouse-like wife clutched a bag of saltwater taffy close to her bosom , as if she feared someone would wrench it from her grasp . The woman spent so much time isolated on their farm , pinned under her spouse 's heavy thumb that she hardly seemed capable of human interaction . On the rare occasions that Leigh had seen and spoken to her , Mrs. Grissom 's tongue had been quickly shackled by a stern look from her husband . Mr. Grissom tipped his hat to Leigh , while his wife lowered her eyes and tightened her grip on the taffy . It was time to inspect the perimeters . Although Leigh was off-duty and the carnival actually fell into the city police 's jurisdiction , she felt a sense of obligation to serve and protect . Besides , there were only six full-time officers on the local force . She always helped out where she could . The darkness edged close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not much real mischief likely around here , but Leigh 's perimeter walks had probably saved more than one set of parents from being made grandparents before their time . She grinned at the memory of embarrassed faces and muttered explanations . Even though she rarely wore a uniform , opting for a sheriff 's department knit shirt and a non-regulation .38 in a fanny holster when on duty , the kids all knew who she was . Tonight she was weaponless . A whooping alarm sounded at the duck shoot . Youthful voices rose in a cheer as the hawker hailed another winner . In spite of his jovial announcement , the man did n't look the least bit pleased to hand over a huge Pink Panther to the marksman . Leigh neared the end of the midway and stopped in her tracks . Standing in the dim lighting at the entrance to the semi-trailer that served as a traveling Tunnel of Love , Brittany Wilson was talking to a man Leigh did n't recognize . She slowly worked her way in their direction . Brittany was a constant source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was the daughter of Leigh 's brother 's partner , and a spirit much too lively to be contained by their rural community . Leigh admired such vivacity , so unlike her own plodding responsibility . Even though most of the girl 's escapades had so far been harmless ( forking yards , sliding down the dam , swimming in the quarry , toilet papering the courthouse square ) , Leigh took extra care to watch over her , just in case her adventurous nature took her down a path of no return . Leigh strolled closer , keeping an ear open for some indication of their conversation . Before she could get close enough to hear , Brittany turned and saw her . The girl waved Leigh closer . " Hey , Leigh . " Brittany turned her gaze back to the stranger . " This is ... " She giggled . " What did you say your name was again ? " " Will Scott . " The man stepped forward and extended his hand to Leigh . A wedge of bright light from the ride entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restlessness played about his eyes . Eyes of the brightest blue shot a bolt of lightning straight to her core . It was a reaction totally visceral , immediate and intense . She had n't been this overcome by pure sexual temptation since Bobby Thompson in the seventh grade . Man , that kid took her breath away . Of course , she reminded herself , that did n't work out too well . Bobby never even knew she existed . " Leigh Mitchell . " She liked the feel of his handshake , firm and dry , not loose and floppy like so many men when they shake hands with a female . A crowd of teenagers called to Brittany . The girl did n't hesitate to abandon them . " Got ta go ! See you around , Will . " " Thanks for the ride , " he called after her . Leigh tucked her chin and eyed the man from under drawn brows . " Ride ? " " Brittany saw me hoofing it down the road and gave me a ride into town . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . " He grinned . " I gave her the standard ' never pick up hitch hikers ' lecture , but it was a little lame coming from someone taking advantage . But " - he nearly looked ashamed - " I really was grateful for the lift . " He raised a foot out in front of him . " New shoes . Blisters . " Then he added , as if he were trying to pull the girl from hot water , " She did promise never to do it again . " " I 'll bet . " Brittany lived several miles outside of Glens Crossing , in a house nestled on a hundred acres of ravined woodland . She had to travel four country roads and the main highway every time she came into town . The girl could n't resist strays - familiar or foreign , canine or human . Leigh looked at Will more closely . He did n't appear to be a homeless vagrant . His hair and clothes were neat and clean . An engaging intelligence showed in his features and his diction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that said " bad boy " about him . Deep down , Leigh had always wanted to have a fling with a bad boy . " Visiting someone in Glens Crossing ? " He shook his head , but did n't offer more . He looked down the length of the midway . " Just passing through , then ? " He shrugged and answered in a distracted tone , " Probably . " She continued to study him , allowing herself to assess him more fully . She prided herself on nailing a person 's true nature on something just short of first sight . It was a gift that she 'd fostered , knowing that in her line of work quick assessment could keep a dicey situation from going completely bad . Will 's gaze was fastened on the Ferris wheel , a childlike gleam in his eye . He appeared totally relaxed , not at all like a person with ulterior motives or something to hide . Just as she started to excuse herself , he said , in a nostalgic tone , " I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't resist . It 's been such a long time .... " Then he looked her in the eye . " Ride with me ? " " Well , I really have- " " Please . " There was such boyishness in his smile , such spark in his eyes she could n't refuse . After all , she was off-duty . Let it go . It was time to do something she wanted to do , simply because she wanted to do it . And , she realized as she looked at him , she did want to spend more time with Will Scott . The mere thought of passing the evening with a total stranger , especially one this attractive , seemed to be the first step in the right direction to break out of her mold-something that a truly cautious and responsible Leigh just would n't do . She decided then and there , this year it was just too bad for those parents whose teenagers were swept away on a tide of hormones . Every morning for the past week as she looked into the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of every person I know . She was still trying to make herself live the pledge . " Okay . " The very utterance of the word was liberating . Good-bye old Leigh , hello new . He took her hand - the contact of an excited child to a parent , not man to woman - and moved so quickly she stumbled along behind . Of course , she had to overcome her initial reaction and allow herself to be dragged-all part of being New Leigh . Steve Clyde , one of her deputies , and his wife passed by . His lingering surprised look as he said good evening tickled Leigh right to her toes . Maybe I 'm not so predictable , huh fella ? Being an independent woman - there was only so much reinventing a person could do in one night-she stepped up to the ticket booth first and purchased her own ticket . Behind her , Will protested that since she sacrificed her time to go with him , he intended to pay . She just smiled . There was nothing sacrificial about her decision . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he piqued her curiosity . Although he had the look of a bad boy , he openly showed childish joy at a simple small-town carnival - something most men had outgrown , or buried beneath a veneer of masculine indifference . Leigh liked simple things . It was nice to meet someone who could share and understand . Once at the top of the Ferris wheel 's rotation , Leigh gripped the lap bar with one hand and , with gentle movements that would n't rock their seat , pointed out the little downtown . It was built around the brick and limestone courthouse whose lighted clock tower stood above all else . As she looked at it , she realized with a pang of regret , that clock tower represented the absolute center of her universe . Suddenly the future rolled out in an endless desert of sameness and that sense of suffocating panic rose once again . Was she going to be an old woman whose days had to be filled with listening to others recount the excitement of youth , the adventures of life , simply because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought made her shudder . The wheel started to turn again and they were slowly lowered below the tree tops . " Where are you from , Will ? " He shrugged , rocking the seat slightly . " Nowhere , really . " " Come , on . Everybody 's from somewhere . Birthplace , high school , there has to be someplace to anchor you . " " Been on the move so long , I ca n't remember living in one place long enough to call it home . " Continues ...
