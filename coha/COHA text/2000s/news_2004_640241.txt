<p> Considering it 's a country music station that has dominated the Denver radio dial for years with hat acts and titans of twang , you have to search hard these days to find the cowboy in KYGO . <p> No country in the ubiquitous yellow- <p> blue 98.5 FM logo - just mountains and skyscrapers . <p> No boots on two of the most popular morning hosts , Jonathan Wilde and Kelly Ford . ' I 'm the original suburban yuppie boy , ' Wilde says with a laugh . <p> OutKast samples layered underneath on-air deejay bits . A headquarters that looks like an insurance office . A playlist tuned far more by computer sampling than some bourbon-soaked talent scout . <p> Yet KYGO scoots on , consistently scuffing the ratings boots of fellow Denver giants KOA talk radio and KBCO world-class rock . In the last four quarterly ratings books , KYGO 's rank in the all-important ' share ' of listeners ages 12 or older was No.1 three times and No.2 once . For the advertiser-coveted 25-to-54 age demographic , KYGO was No.1 twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it , narrow view or long view , you 'll get the same position for KYGO , ' said Mike Henry , a Denver radio consultant not connected with the station or its parent , Jefferson Pilot Communications . Henry calls KYGO ' a rarefied case , as a country station that has dominated the market for so long . ' <p> Critics slammed the station as a primary collaborator in the Garth-ing and Faith-ing of country music in the 1990s , pulling 350,000 listeners a week toward watered-down Nashville Lite instead of the raw emotion and roots instruments that ' real ' country once represented . <p> ' I think people should be concerned when corporations - record labels and radio stations in this case - dilute and dumb down one of the nation 's finest art forms to make a buck for themselves , ' said Marty Jones , a Denver country musician and promoter . ' What they do is what most rock stations do : They play the most broad-appealing , mass-marketed segment of country music . And generally speaking in any music form , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit , without a lot of soul and guts to it . ' <p> Cry me a river , respond the hosts and directors of the low-key country monster . They know their audience , they serve it with a mix of predictability and comfortable personality , and every hour on KYGO is produced live and local . <p> ' I think the mainstream media does n't listen to us , ' Ford said , checking a flood of incoming e-mail on a recent Friday morning after she talked on-air about her dying dog , Bart . ' The mainstream media wants to be highbrow , and we 're perceived as lowbrow . I said to my husband when I took this job , ' My career is over , I 've gone country . ' But this is the music of my generation . ' <p> Without hearing Ford 's words , longtime fan Dixie Graham echoed them . Graham wrote in to sympathize about Bart , and later explained why , in her 50th year , KYGO is the preset on her car radio and the background sound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase 30 years ago , and I do n't want to do it anymore , ' Graham said . She grew up listening to rockabilly songs that told a story , and her own daughter brought her back to country during the Garth Brooks explosion of the early 1990s . <p> The tempo and the tone of KYGO 's mix are ' the pace that I listen to , ' Graham said . <p> Market research <p> When KYGO program director Joel Burke tells the story of a musical discovery he made this past winter , fans and critics alike will find in it all the ammo they need for their arguments . <p> Burke said he spends about half his week on talent development . But beyond visits to the Grizzly Rose , Colorado 's revered country nightclub , Burke is usually not scrawling notes on napkins in smoky bars . KYGO employs call-outs , where pollsters offer 20-second bites of old and new songs to get a sense of what listeners want . Burke also pores over SoundScan reports of local and national record sales . <p> ' There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , Josh Turner , a gospel singer , called ' Long Black Train . ' I was reluctant to play it for a while , ' Burke said . It was a darker song than KYGO 's usual hayride party mix , and most country stations have gradually turned away from gospel overtones , despite the deep roots shared by the two genres . <p> But Turner 's CD started selling well on SoundScan 's Denver listings , ' without any help from KYGO playlists , ' Burke said . <p> ' I look at legal downloads , too , to see what songs people are investing in , ' Burke added . Wal-Mart , the No.1 country music retailer , added downloads at Christmas , and Turner 's song sold well in that mainstream mecca . <p> ' That was a loud horn for me that something was going on , ' Burke said . He started ' Long Black Train ' low on the rotation , and soon noticed the CD selling 400 copies in Denver alone in weekly reports . <p> Turner is now a rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programmers who pay attention . <p> ' One of the things country radio can fall into is waiting for Nashville to hand them the next single , ' he said . ' So we ca n't wait . We need a collaborative effort to listen to new stuff . ' <p> What the people want ? <p> Using computer printouts instead of spontaneous deejay spirit is precisely the problem , Jones countered . ' KYGO getting such high ratings might mean that the station is giving the folks what they want . Or what the marketing machine tells them they should want , ' Jones said . <p> Texas radio consultant Ed Shane , who has no contracts with KYGO or Jefferson Pilot , rejects most of that criticism , saying the station stays in the lead by serving its listeners . He praised KYGO for changing its mix in the past year to include more classic country songs by George Strait , Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard - legendary acts whose hard-core sound is shunned by many ' countrypolitan ' stations . Even John Denver makes an occasional appearance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't follow the national trend , they follow the local market , ' Shane said . ' They feel like Denver . Joel Burke keeps his ear to the ground . ' <p> Mixing in more of the old reflects a slight fade in the suburban cowboy boom of the 1990s , when Garth Brooks was the biggest pop star , period , and KYGO 's leading market share represented a far bigger audience . <p> Despite the rise of Toby Keith and the continuing power of Shania Twain 's career , no new groups tested with listeners are instant heroes like Brooks , said Bob Call , general manager of Jefferson Pilot 's five Denver stations . <p> ' When you do the battle of new songs , and they all lose , that 's when the older mix comes back , ' Call said . The silver lining for a dominant country station , he added , is that more than most genres , country listeners tend to honor the full catalog of songs . <p> ' It 's hard to find another format that plays way back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A survivor <p> KYGO has knocked out or simply outlasted much of its competition in country music over the years . In the ' Urban Cowboy ' heyday of the 1980s , the station had up to four competing signals at a given time , Call said . Now the alternatives are limited to KCKK-1600 AM 's ' Kickin ' Country , ' a classics and oldies signal that is also part of the Jefferson Pilot fold , and tiny foes like Spanish-language Norteo formats or KCUV-1510 AM 's American roots mix . <p> The flagship KYGO morning crew alternately crows about that impressive record , and begs to differ . <p> ' Every competitor they 've ever had , they ran off , ' Wilde said . <p> Ford steps on his last words : ' And it 's also like saying that Kentucky Fried Chicken does n't have any competition in fast food . They have to compete against Burger King , McDonald 's , Taco Bell . Our direct competitors for people 's ears are KBCO and Lewis &; Floorwax ( on 103.5 The Fox ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the one visible country influence in the studio on a Friday morning , Steve ' Mudflap ' McGrew . Looking like his stablehand forgot to use the currycomb , McGrew hunkers over the microphone in blue jeans and a Western-yoke cowboy shirt , complaining about his dog and his ex-wives . <p> McGrew is a stand-up comic who plays in a country band on the side , who agreed to the KYGO morning slot only if he could still hit the road for gigs . He is the bad boy listeners love to egg on . Between Ford 's stories about trusty dog Bart and cracks about McGrew 's love life , KYGO thrives on these daily conversations with the invisible audience . <p> Mudflap talks into his mic about giving up a girlfriend who did n't get along with his dog . A reader immediately writes in by e-mail , ' Hey , cowboy , you got yer rope in a knot if yer choosin ' the dog over the woman ! ' <p> Ford chimes in , ' Is this just another veiled attempt to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wuddu n't veiled ! ' drawls Mudflap . <p> The family-friendly chatter varies little from hit morning shows in other music formats , like ' The Dom and Jane ' show on Mix 100.3 . And everyone at KYGO promotes that ' you could be anywhere ' sense of the radio dial . <p> ' So much of country now is just the Southern rock of the 1970s , ' Burke said . <p> ' It 's crossed over a lot more than people like to admit to , ' Ford said . ' We 're the station they lie to the pollsters about .
