<p> Shenzhen , China  --  Lei Huang could be a poster child for China 's laboring classes . <p> For each 60-hour week he works on an assembly line for Foxconn , a manufacturer of electronics and computer parts in this south China manufacturing hub , he earns $32 and a bunk in a dormitory room with 19 other laborers . <p> At the factory , managers forbid workers from talking or resting outside of two 10-minute breaks , he said . <p> Labor rights groups have long documented low pay and strict management in Chinese factories . But as Western firms increasingly move manufacturing to China to cut costs and raise profits , activists are adopting a strategy of publicizing conditions at globally recognized companies including Foxconn , which supplies dozens of international brands , including Apple Inc. , from its Shenzhen facilities . <p> The goal is to pressure management to improve conditions . <p> A spokesman for Foxconn , the trade name of the Taiwanese-owned firm Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. , was not available for comment on this article . <p> Last month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , issued a report stating that several Chinese suppliers to Wal-Mart routinely fail to pay wages and provide health insurance as required by Chinese law . <p> The survey of 16 Wal-Mart suppliers found that some pay as little as half the minimum daily wage , provide no health insurance or require mandatory overtime . One company provided only one bathroom for its 2,000 employees , the group said . <p> The report prompted Wal-Mart to investigate the factories , and auditors found instances of underage workers and violations of overtime laws , though not all of the companies mentioned in the report were " direct Wal-Mart suppliers , " said Jonathan Dong , a Wal-Mart spokesman . <p> He explained that some products sold at Wal-Mart are purchased from distributors , complicating efforts to monitor labor conditions . <p> " The suppliers with infractions were put on our warning list and there will be a rigorous auditing process to follow up , " Dong said , adding that Wal-Mart had recently increased the number of unannounced audits it conducts worldwide . <p> Low wages common <p> Wages below government-mandated minimums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $45 to $101 a month  --  are common in Chinese factories , experts said . Other problems are forced overtime and poor working conditions . A recent report by Verite , a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization working to improve labor practices worldwide , found that " systemic problems in payment practices in Chinese export factories consistently rob workers of at least 15 percent of their pay . " <p> Activists hope the growing focus on " shaming " well-known companies could have a significant impact on labor standards , said Li Qiang , director of China Labor Watch . <p> China is the world 's largest exporter and the largest single source of American imports . In 2005 , the year for which the most recent available data are available , factories in China shipped $163 billion worth of goods to the United States , 30 percent more than in 2004 . <p> Tuesday , the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. has a $232.5 billion trade deficit with China , the highest ever recorded with a single country . <p> Because the Chinese government " is most concerned about economic growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is growing recognition among labor rights activists that the best way to make gains in China 's labor standards is by publicly shaming well-known corporations , " Li said . <p> Conditions chronicled <p> That lesson was reinforced last summer after a series of news articles chronicled labor conditions at the Shenzhen factory run by Foxconn . <p> In June , London 's Mail on Sunday newspaper ran a story documenting forced overtime and use of corporal punishment , including having workers stand still for long periods and do push-ups in the factory that builds iPods for Apple . <p> The story prompted a series of Chinese journalists to investigate conditions at the factory . One Beijing Times story reported that workers averaged 80 hours of overtime each month , far more than labor laws permit . <p> Apple responded quickly , sending a team of inspectors to the factory to interview workers and study personnel records . <p> In August it said that while Foxconn complied with its supplier code of conduct in " the majority of areas audited , " management had committed some violations , including disciplining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apple said it would ask Foxconn to discontinue . <p> While Apple 's auditors found that Foxconn paid at least the minimum wage , the audit report stated that " the pay structure was unnecessarily complex " and that workers labored more than six consecutive days 25 percent of the time . Chinese law requires that workers must have at least one day off each week . <p> To improve what Apple considered substandard dormitories , Foxconn committed to increasing " total living space " by 46 percent , the report stated , adding that Apple had hired Verite to monitor compliance . <p> The reprimand and Foxconn 's commitment to improve practices thrilled activists . <p> " The Foxconn case was an example of how publicity can have a significant impact on labor practices , " said Tai Ngai Lung , program coordinator for the Hong Kong-based group Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior . <p> " The lesson is that we have to make abuses very public . " <p> Documenting labor abuses , is difficult , and many Chinese companies are adept at hiding problems , experts said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to track actual accounting and one to show auditors  --  and coach workers how to respond to outsiders asking about the factory . <p> During a recent audit in eastern China , Verite investigators found a cheat sheet for employees with the question , " Does the company use corporal punishment ? " <p> The prepared answer was , " Never . " <p> Journalists keep out <p> Other companies , including Western firms , prohibit journalists from facilities . Apple denied several requests to visit Foxconn facilities producing iPods while a Foxconn spokesman said that without Apple 's permission , journalists could not visit " or we could be sued . " <p> A sign outside a section of Foxconn 's Shenzhen campus stated that no recording devices are allowed on the grounds . <p> Anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that Foxconn , which according to Chinese media reports employs 200,000 workers , breaks Chinese labor laws . <p> Eighteen-year-old Huang Duomei , who had moved to the Shenzhen district of Longhua from China 's eastern Anhui province last summer , said some workers at the factory worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more overtime pay . " <p> According to local and national laws , the assembly line worker Lei Huang 's weekly salary should be at least $38 , slightly more than he reported earning , said a local labor bureau official , who gave only her surname , Li . <p> But determining whether laws are broken in China is complicated because companies can deduct charges for room and board before paying workers , she added . <p> Less difficult to document is China 's poor workplace safety . According to the government office in charge of work safety , 14,382 people died in " industrial accidents " in China in 2006 . <p> Workplace safety is particularly poor in Shenzhen , experts said . Seven died an underwear factory fire last month after sponge used in bras " apparently blocked the only exit and emitted a poisonous smoke , " the China Daily reported . <p> But Chinese workers continue to seek factory jobs because they pay more than farming . <p> " If people know that a computer or toy was built in a sweatshop , they are less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li said . <p> VITAL STATISTICS <p> $232.5 billion : The U.S. trade deficit with China , the highest ever recorded with a single country . <p> $163 billion : The value of goods China shipped to the United States in 2005 . <p> $45 to $101 a month : Chinese government-mandated minimum wages , set by local officials .
