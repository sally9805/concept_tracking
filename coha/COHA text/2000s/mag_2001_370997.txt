President Bush 's decision to fund work on some 60-odd existing colonies of human stem cells , and only those colonies , hit a serious snag last week with the revelation that virtually all stem cells are cultivated using embryonic mouse tissue . The mouse cells provide the human ones with nutrients and growth factors crucial to their survival and proliferation . The problem : under FDA rules , mouse-fed stem cells given to treat human patients would be considered a " xenotransplant , " or tissue from another species . Although hundreds of patients have received liver and fetal cells from pigs without any sign of foreign infection , the agency could halt a stem-cell procedure if it felt the human patient was at risk of getting an animal virus . The news sparked renewed calls for the President to loosen his policy and allow further harvesting from embryos , this time without using animal tissue in the Petri dish . Senator John Kerry warns that if federal dollars are n't made available for new cell lines , Congress may yet wrest the policy from the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P>  --  Reported by Frederic Golden/New York
