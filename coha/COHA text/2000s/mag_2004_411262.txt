. A Native American hunter of the 18th century truly appreciated what he killed . Everything would be eaten  --  all the meat , plus the heart and liver . The brains were used for tanning hides , and the hides were used for clothing . The antlers were used to make tools , and the hooves were boiled to make glue . Even the bones were cracked for their marrow . We have it easier today , but we can still take a lesson from our " primitive " forebears . 1 Eat the heart Medieval nobles helped themselves to the finer cuts of the stag , leaving the " umbles "  --  the heart , liver , and entrails  --  to the servants . Thus was born the term humble pie , but the expression does a disservice to a complex and exquisite meat  --  the fresh heart of the deer . It is lean , dense muscle , easy to clean and easy to prepare . Heart meat should be eaten within a day or two . To clean , split the heart in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat . ( A word of caution is in order : Check the meat for bullet fragments before cooking . Chomping down on a bullet jacket is unforgettable . ) Rinse well under cool running water . Now you can simply slice the meat thinly , roll it in flour , and fry it fast and medium-rare . Or give the heart the royal treatment : Dice it into 1-inch cubes and saute in butter with four strips of bacon and one diced onion . Add 1/2 cup water , 1/4 cup red wine , and 1 1/2 cups peeled , diced tomatoes . Cover and simmer for 90 minutes , then stir in 1/2 cup sour cream . Season with salt and pepper to taste . Serve over egg noodles. 2 Make rattling antlers You 'll need a set of points with three to four tines on each side . Cut off the brow tines so you wo n't bash your thumbs , and the tips so you do n't gore yourself . Sand or rasp away sharp edges or burrs . Drill a small hole at the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cutting bone and antler . ) Thread the end of a 3-foot-long piece of black parachute cord through each hole and tie a stopper knot at each end . The week before opening day , toss the antlers into water to replenish lost moisture . And paint a tine or two blaze orange . 3 Preserve and dye bucktail for streamers With a sharp knife , split the underside of the tail for several inches toward the tip , then roll the hide back , grasp the exposed tailbone firmly , and pull out the bone . Split the tail the rest of the way and scrape away all fat . If you plan on tying flies in the next few weeks , a generous rubbing of salt is all that 's needed for a quick cure . For longer storage , pour Borax powder onto the flesh side and grind it in . Let the tail cure for a week or two . To color it , soak it overnight in a bath of soapy water , then rinse thoroughly half a dozen times to remove all soap residue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's ready for the dye vat . Rit Dye is fine for starters ; simmer the solution and tails over low heat with a tablespoon of vinegar to help set the color , then rinse , dry , and head for the fly vise. 4 Green-score the rack To gain entry into the Boone and Crockett record book , your deer must be measured by an official B &C; scorer after a 60-day drying period . But you can get your own score by using any measuring tape . It 's called green scoring , and here 's the formula for a typical whitetail . ( All measurements are to the nearest 1/8 inch . ) Measure the length of the longer main beam . Then , the inside spread of the main beams ; if this is less than or equal to your previous notation , it 's your first number to keep . But if it is greater , discard it and use the original figure instead . Call whichever you retain A. For each antler , add up the following : length of main beam ; length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point , but do not include its length in your measurements here ) ; the circumference at the smallest place between the burr and the first point ; and the circumferences at the smallest places between the first and second , second and third , and third and fourth points ( or halfway between the third point and beam tip ) . Add the two antler totals together to get B. Take A plus B to get your gross subtotal , C. Now for the deductions : Take the differences between the corresponding measurements of each antler , i.e. , beam and point lengths , and the various circumferences . For example , if the right beam is 2 inches longer than the left one , write down that amount . Do the same for each individual measure , and total them . To this figure , add the lengths of all abnormal points  --  those tines that do n't project from the top of the main beam , or that do n't have a matching tine on the other antler . This is D. Subtract D from C for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Russ Carman , a professional trapping-lure maker for 35 years , goes about it : To collect urine while field-dressing your buck , puncture the bladder and fill a small glass bottle with the stuff . Store it in the freezer . Cut off the tarsal glands and trim everything away , leaving only the dark , malodorous centers . Chop these into small pieces  --  hide and hair together  --  and pack it into the bottom of a small glass bottle . Cover it with propylene glycol and keep the resulting solution in a warm place for three to four months  --  the top of a water heater is perfect . A day or two before you hit the woods , strain out the solids and mix in a dollop of thawed urine . " The volatile urine activates the tarsal tincture , " Carman explains , " and that 's as good a deer scent as there is in the world . " 6 Take the tenderloins These are the long fillets that run parallel to the deer 's backbone inside the rib cage , under the saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most tender care . All they need is a sharp knife to remove them ; a quick rinse ; a trip into a plastic baggie fast , to prevent drying . Besides that , they simply call to be sliced into medallions , pan-seared in real butter seasoned with black pepper and rosemary , and eaten with the fingers . 7 Make buttons , zipper pulls Racks too small to show off are sized perfectly for handmade buttons and zipper pulls . For a button , use a hacksaw to cut off a tine at the diameter you need . Using the tag end of the tine as a handle , sand the cut surface , first with 80-grit sandpaper , and then 120-grit . Next , saw off a disk about 3/16 inch thick , and buff the other side . Drill thread holes with a 3/32-inch bit , spacing the holes evenly . To make a zipper pull , saw off a tine about an inch long . Smooth the surface with sandpaper and drill a small hole into the center of the antler , about 1/2 inch deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thread a small screw eye into the hole . Attach it to the zipper with a small loop of rawhide or ribbon . 8 Tan the hide Tanning a deer hide with the hair on is work , but manageable . Here 's the drill : Stretch the skin over a two-by-six . With a dull knife held at 90 degrees to the surface , scrape off all remaining muscle , sinew , and membrane . Rub copious amounts of noniodized salt into the flesh side , roll it up , toss it in a plastic bag , and put it in the freezer . Two to three days later , let it thaw , flesh it again , and wash out the salt . Prepare a tanning solution of 4 gallons of water , 1 pound of granulated alum , and 1 pound of salt . Soak the hide for a week , stirring once a day . Remove it from the tanning bath and squeeze it dry . Lather the flesh side with neat's-foot oil ; let this soak in for a few hours . Stretch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saw-horse or table , and work it back and forth , as hard as you can , to soften it . Use a rounded dowel or butter-knife handle for the hard-to-reach corners . If you think you 're finished in less than eight hours , you 're not . 9 Roast a haunch The 17th-century poet and soldier of fortune Gervase Markham had this advice : " Stick it with cloves all over on the outside ... larde it either with Mutton larde , or Porke larde , but Mutton is the best : then spit it and roast it by a good soking fire , then take Vinegar , bread crummes , and some of the gravy , which comes from the Venison , and boile them well in a dish : then season it with sugar , cinamon , ginger , and salt , and serve the Venison fourth upon the sauce when it is roasted enough . " Of course , Markham was writing in the England of 1615 , when six servants were assigned to every respectable kitchen . Here 's an easier way : Cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bone out the haunch . Stuff the bone cavity with a 50-50 mixture of diced dried cherries and toasted pecans . Tie it with kitchen twine . Roll it in a spice rub made of 3 tablespoons each of ground cumin and brown sugar ; 3 teaspoons each of ground ginger and garlic powder ; and 2 teaspoons each of ground red pepper and Chinese five-spice powder . Roast it at 350 degrees until a meat thermometer reads 140 degrees ( rare ) to 160 degrees ( medium ) . ( If you 're looking for an imaginative main course for Christmas dinner , you ca n't do better . ) Slice and bask in your own glory . 10 Pay homage Tipping your hat  --  and heart  --  to the spirit of the animal is an ancient tradition found in hunting cultures all over the world . It occurs in such diverse places as Germany and the Kalahari Desert of Botswana , where the I-Kang tribesmen apologize to the animal and thank it even as they are tracking it down to kill it . In its simplest form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swan , film-maker and author of The Sacred Art of Hunting , knows of hunters who recite Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 ( the " time for everything " passage of Scripture ) at the site of a kill . Another level of tribute involves giving something up in return . Native Americans often dropped cornmeal by the bodies of the game they took , which according to Swan " sprang from the belief that sacrifice on the hunter 's part honors the spirit of nature . " Europe has its " last bite " or " last sprig " tradition . As the hunter approaches the downed animal , he breaks off a sprig of green growth . Half of it goes into the animal 's mouth . The remaining piece is dipped in the animal 's blood and fastened to the hunter 's hat . More contemporary ideas include burying the heart of the deer ( if you choose to ignore the first item on this list ) to acknowledge that the wild essence of the animal stays in the woods , or planting a tree for each deer killed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's more about the attitude than the action . " Illustration <p>                     @x Elena had been expecting Dmitri for more than an hour when he finally stormed through the back door of the Blue Turtle , the Vancouver restaurant where they both worked . <p> She 'd come in early , as was her habit , to cook in the agreeable quiet of the Sunday morning kitchen , when the young apprentices and line cooks and dishwashers were all still abed after their Saturday night revelries . Her only companion was Luis , the forty-something El Salvadorian commis , who stirred his stockpots with a hand so brown and squat it looked like a hand balloon . He sang cheerfully under his breath , a bloody old Spanish folk song about a conquistador taking revenge on his enemy . It made Elena think of nights at the VFW when she was eleven or twelve , drinking Cokes while everyone danced the two-step . No doubt it made Luis think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Elena stood at the stove , stirring pale pink shallots and yellow onions with a long wooden spoon , thinking of the things she needed to check for service today . She thought of conquistadores and the plate armor they 'd worn to protect themselves from arrows . <p> Mainly , she thought of Dmitri , who had betrayed her . <p> Her whole body ached this morning , back and hips from the old injuries , shoulders and neck from trying to erect the armor she had to assemble afresh each and every day , finely honed plates of sharp arrogance and bad language beneath which she-the secret and guarded Elena-could hide . She rolled her shoulder blades down her back , reminded herself to stand tall . <p> Shake it off . <p> When the onions were nearly done , she crushed garlic with the flat of her knife , and was about to scrape it into the mix when Dmitri burst through the back door . Hearing his fury in the slam of the door , she pulled the pan off the fire and turned to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes in his beautiful Russian face , he strode through the kitchen and flung a newspaper down on the counter . She turned off the burner and wiped her hands . <p> The paper was turned to the front page of the Lifestyle section , and featured a photo taken two weeks before . Of Elena , dressed in chef 's whites at the end of a shift , long blonde hair pulled back from her face beneath the bright scarves she had adopted as her trademark . She lifted a glass of wine to the camera with a crooked smile and a saucy cock of a brow . It was a good photo , she thought again . It made her look younger than her thirty-eight years , sexier , charming . The headline read : <p> STANDING UP TO THE HEAT BLUE TURTLE CHEF SAYS LIFE AS A FEMALE IN THE KITCHEN IS NOT EASY , BUT WORTH IT <p> " I saw it , " she said mildly . <p> " You are fired . " <p> " What ? " Her head jerked up . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked me better than you . And you 're right there in the first paragraph anyway ! " <p> " It is my kitchen . Your focus should have been on the restaurant , on the menu . Not on yourself . " <p> " It is not your kitchen ! " she said , slamming her knife down on the counter . " You have the title of chef , but you know as well as I do that we built this menu and this kitchen together . It 's as much mine as it is yours . " <p> " Is it ? " He raised his index finger . " One question , hmm ? " When he got angry or excited or passionate , his speech slipped into the Russian accent he 'd labored over many years to lose . " Whose name is on that door ? " <p> She wiped her hands , heat in her throat . " Yours . " <p> He grabbed the paper , slapped it with the fingers of his other hand . It sounded like a gunshot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article ? " His eyes , the color of cognac , burned with a yellow heat . " Hmm ? " <p> " Is n't it supposed to be about the restaurant ? " <p> He gave her a withering look . The restaurant did not belong to him . The kitchen did . <p> " You told me to talk to her . " Elena shrugged . " I talked . " <p> A long , simmering silence hung between them , filled with the scent of onions and bruised garlic and the New Mexican chiles she 'd asked to have imported . Feigning disdain for his tantrum , she turned the burner back off , pulled the pan back to the fire , and scraped the garlic into it . The back of her neck burned with satisfaction , with worry and loss , with desire . She could smell him over the food , a heady mix of sweat and spices , cigarettes and sex , which he 'd not had with her . Beneath her armor , her flesh wept . <p> " It was revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garlic into the butter , and put the spoon down . Met his eyes . <p> The minute the reporter had come through the doors with her old-school feminist hair-steely , frizzled salt and pepper-Elena had known she had a chance to get back at Dmitri . <p> And more , she 'd earned it . Not only had he seized the glory from their joint effort to create the menu and the environment of the Blue Turtle , but two months ago , he 'd moved out of their shared apartment to live with a girl with breasts like fried eggs and the guileless hero worship only a twenty-three-year-old CIA graduate could afford . <p> That would be the Culinary Institute of America , not the Central Intelligence Agency . <p> The garlic could not be neglected . Elena stirred in fire-roasted Anaheim chiles , letting them warm slowly . The scent had zest , dampness , appetite to it . Even Dmitri could not resist bending toward it , inhaling it . She looked at the top of his head , the thick hair . <p> Looked away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had become something more as Elena let herself open up to the reporter , her sharp eyes , her sympathy . " She was a feminist , Dmitri , " she said in the calm voice she had cultivated , " a woman who wanted to do a story about a woman in a man 's world . " She adjusted the flame the tiniest bit . " I gave it to her . And it worked-the restaurant is on the front page of the Lifestyle section . " <p> " You 're fired , " he said , punching the air with a finger . <p> She rolled her eyes . " Do n't be ridiculous . " <p> " Oh , I assure you , I am not . When I come back here in an hour , I want you gone , not a trace . " <p> " Dmitri ! " <p> He turned , crisp as a Cossack , and marched out of the kitchen . <p> Automatically , Elena pulled the pursing her lips . He 'd fired her in the past , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call an hour or a day later to beg forgiveness . He needed her , Elena knew . More than he had sense to realize . <p> And he would likely calm down this time , too . Call later and beg her to come back . <p> Luis , who had pretended not to watch the scene unfolding , tsked . <p> Elena , embarrassed , shook her head . " He 'll get over it . " <p> " Si . " <p> But there was , suddenly , weariness in her . Too many fights , too many late nights spent trying to fix whatever it was that had gone wrong . She felt the exhaustion at the base of her neck , along the backs of her eyes . She lacked the energy to go another round with him . As much as she hated to start over-again ! - this was broken . It was time to admit it . <p> She should never have begun . From the moment of their first meeting , she 'd known that he was dangerous to her , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , she had resisted him , sticking to her unbroken rule to never sleep with a man who had power over her , and Dmitri was even more dangerous than most , a chef with a Russian accent and the mouth of a rock star , a man with that intelligent , amoral twinkle in his eye . <p> But he pursued her , relentlessly , and Elena had fallen . Fallen to his genius as much as his beauty , fallen to his supposedly undying adoration of her , the mark of a man who lived on his charm . <p> Now she would pay the price . This silent Sunday morning , she folded her apron and put it on the pass-out bar , then went to the staff room , changed from her chef 's whites and clogs into jeans and a long-sleeved shirt tie-dyed in soft pink and orange , with tiny dancing skeletons on it . A gift from one of her sisters last Christmas , to remind her of home . Packed everything from her locker into the duffel she carried to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one last look . <p> The Blue Turtle had been her home for three years , the menu a loving union of Dmitri 's old-school French methods and Elena 's Santa Fe roots . Vancouverites , adventurous eaters that they were , adored the exotic fusion . The restaurant was a success in a very crowded market , and was attracting international press attention . <p> This was her home , not some faraway town . A blister of fury zapped from the base of her spine through the top of her head . Bastard . How dare he banish her like this ? <p> Luis raised his chin . " Vaya con Dios . " <p> Elena nodded . Hiking the duffel over her shoulder , she swallowed the hollow sense of loss and headed out to the softness of an early Vancouver morning . For a long moment , she stood there on the sidewalk with a hole in her chest , trying to think what to do . <p> How depressing to lose yet another home . Another and another and another . She had grown fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one place . Her place . <p> Now what ? <p> Across the street , English Bay lay like a mirror in the fresh opalescence of morning . A storm gathered in the distant west , sending a gust of rain-scented wind over her face . She shook loose the hair on her shoulders , and tried to bring her mind to something practical . What could she have for breakfast ? There was some fresh spinach , perhaps a hunk of cheese , some pear salad left from the night before . <p> A man suddenly stepped out of the doorway , and , startled , Elena took a step backward to let him pass . There was an air of confidence about him , something both severe and sensual . Very dark glasses hid his eyes . A thin , hip goatee circled his mouth . She admired the spotlessness of his black jacket , the jeans he wore casually beneath it . Strong thighs , she noticed , relieved to discover Dmitri had not entirely killed her pleasure in the opposite sex . <p> The man gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She inclined her head . A silk scarf , ribboned with faint orange and pink stripes , looped around his neck . Elegant . Smart . Maybe he was French . " Bonjour , " she said with a faint smile . <p> To her surprise , he paused . " Are you Elena Alvarez ? " <p> " Who wants to know ? " <p> " Sorry , " he said , tugging off his hat and sunglasses in a single fluid gesture . He had the uncanny grace and coloring of something supernatural-a vampire , perhaps . Tumbles of black hair fell down on a pale , finely boned face . " I 'm Julian Liswood . " <p> " Ah . " The owner of the restaurant . He carried a newspaper under his arm-he must have seen the article . Elena brushed her hands together-finished . " Dmitri already fired me , so do n't bother . " <p> His lips , that only pool of color in his face , quirked . " On the contrary . I came to Vancouver to speak with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you have a few minutes ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> He studied her face . " You 're quite blonde , " he commented . " For someone named Alvarez . " <p> " Does that figure into the discussion ? " <p> A flash of a smile crossed his mouth . " No . " <p> Elena waited . He was n't what she 'd always imagined , either . The face was not beautiful-that high-bridged nose and sharp cheekbones-but the hair was good . His eyes were steady and very dark and intelligent . It was hard to tell how old he was , but she knew he 'd made his first movie when she was in high school . A decade older than she ? He did n't look it . Behind them a wind swept closer , bringing with it the sound of rain . <p> " Will you let me buy you breakfast ? " he asked . " We 'll talk . " <p> " I 'm a chef , as it happens , and my apartment is not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . " Why do n't I cook instead ? " <p> " Sadly , I do not have enough time . I have to fly to LA this morning to pick up my daughter . " <p> " Then by all means , let 's go to the Sylvia . " It was an agreeable and famous old hotel . <p> They walked there beneath a sky that grew darker by the moment , heavy with rain . He moved with such effortless , long strides that Elena looked at his feet to see if he was actually touching the sidewalk . She felt a little dizzy , overwhelmed , and tried to think of something to say . " Do n't you have a movie out right now ? " <p> " It 's just gone to DVD . " He looked sideways at her . " Are you a horror fan ? " <p> " Not really . I like ghost stories , but the slasher flicks are too violent for me , honestly . " <p> " I prefer ghost stories , " he said , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you make more of them , then ? " <p> " The others are in fashion . " He tucked his hat in his pocket . " They finance my smaller projects . " <p> A man in a white shirt and white tie came hustling forward and seated them at a table by the windows . Elena ordered tea and milk ; Mr. Liswood , coffee . In the corner , she saw a cluster of uniformed staff whispering , looking their way . She nodded toward them . " You 've caused a stir . " <p> He skimmed the jacket from his shoulders . " I do n't think it 's me . " <p> A woman held up the newspaper and pointed to the picture . She waved , smiling . " Oh , " Elena said , pleased . She waved back . <p> " Your first taste of fame ? " <p> She thought of long ago , the New Mexico newspapers . But that had been more notoriety than fame , so dark and heavy she 'd had to flee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , then shifted her attention back to him . " But you 're no stranger to it , are you ? " <p> " I am not usually recognized for myself , " he said , " but for the wives I have unwisely collected . " <p> His rueful straightforwardness disarmed her , and Elena laughed , the sound shaking loose from some rusty place in her chest . His wives were tabloid fodder , starlets who began their careers in the teen slasher flicks that had made him his fortune . Restaurants were a sideline . Celebrity owners were not always the most adept , but Julian Liswood had earned the respect of the press and-harder to capture-his workforce . The Blue Turtle was the third he 'd opened to spectacular success . <p> Elena said , " They have been rather beautiful wives , as I recall . " <p> " Well , you know what they say : never marry a girl prettier than you . " <p> She thought , with a pang , of Dmitri . " Been there . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me- " She almost said , there have been so many men , but that would have been too frank . Outside , rain began to splat against the window . She shivered slightly . Pulling her cup toward her , she said , " Now , tell me , Mr. Liswood , what do you have in mind ? " <p> " Please call me Julian . " <p> " I 'll try . Julian . " <p> He took his time , stirring a lump of rough brown sugar into his coffee with a tiny spoon . His oval nails were manicured , and she wondered what kind of man had time for something like that . But of course , in his world , the veneer of such details would be required . She envisioned a cocktail party sparkling with beautiful people , manned by obsequious servers . It made her nervous . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
