A murder mystery : Will the desperate donor heart shortage result in murder for money ? <p> Judge Harcourt Purcell : Class I Heart Transplant Candidate : Patient needs a heart within six months . <p> Dr. David Chandler , chief of cardiology at Douglass University Medical Center , entered this information into his computer terminal , the stubby index finger of each hand stumbling along the keyboard . Now , more than ever , he regretted not taking typing classes in high school . But back then , girls took typing and boys took shop . He shook his head and smiled , scratching his end-of-the-day stubble . He would not have been caught dead in a typing class . <p> He had made a small three-piece bookcase in high school consisting of a two-foot-long flat board and two bookends connected together with dowels , sanded , stained and polished to a rich chestnut finish . The shop teacher criticized that the two bookends were not perfectly symmetrical and gave him a B for the project . It was the only B he got all year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a four-drawer gray filing cabinet in the corner of his office , where the ancient but still usable walnut bookcase with the uneven sides was now propped up at one end by the thin volume of Osler 's Aphorisms . It was still sturdy enough to hold the current editions of his reference books : the Physicians ' Desk Reference , one of his sources of drug information ; Heart Disease , A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine , which he used for general cardiology matters ; and Cardiac Electrophysiology , From Cell to Bedside , his bible on heart rhythm disorders . Their cracked bindings , feathered corners , and numerous Post-Its jutting from the pages silently testified to his frequent educational forays as he cared for his large patient population . <p> But paper references were becoming obsolete , he lamented , because by the time they were published , the data were no longer current . With increasing frequency he was forced to log on to the American College of Cardiology 's Internet Web site , ACCardio , to answer his clinical questions with cutting-edge information . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , he would be whizzing through his workweek , saving countless hours taken up by his hunt-and-peck method . The crafted bookcase should be worth its weight in gold , he figured , calculating what it had cost him in lost typing skills . The hospital was gradually transforming daily operations to digital procedures , so that previous handwritten entries for drug orders or daily notes were performed on hand-held computers or laptops and beamed or e-mailed to receiving stations for downloading to the patients ' charts . Misread handwriting was a major source of hospital errors . His ten-year-old grandson , Tyler , was already typing forty-five words a minute into the discarded Mac laptop he inherited when Chandler upgraded his unit . Maybe I ought to go back and take a typing class , he thought , not really believing that he would ever do it because of the time crunch . He barely got through his usual twelve-hour days as it was . <p> Striking " enter , " he sat back in his leather desk chair and rubbed his nose , trying to imagine how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the database of the United Network of Organ Sharing bank located hundreds of miles away in Richmond , Virginia . UNOS would then try to match the needs of each patient in the database to the organ availability in some sort of an equitable fashion . Need always outdistanced organ availability . He knew that some of his patients traveled to China for transplants , where it was rumored that Chinese officials removed kidneys and hearts from executed prisoners for a very profitable living . Crime did pay in that country . <p> Sitting in his tiny office on the second floor of the wood and glass outpatient wing of Douglass University Hospital , newly renovated through a gift from an anonymous patient , he marveled at the technology that allowed this national network to determine who lived and who died . Typing finally completed , Chandler stood and stretched his six-foot lanky frame . He was more gaunt than thin , with prominent cheekbones and sparse gray hair skirting his head like a horseshoe . Clothes draped on his body as if designed by Armani , though if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Armani , a patient of mine ? " A hooked nose separated two deep-set blue eyes with thin lashes and eyebrows that , more often than not , arched upwards in constant surprise or consternation . Dark circles beneath his eyes told of long hours spent at the hospital . <p> Though not harsh , he projected a no-nonsense , professorial look to the world . The house staff , composed of doctors in training , learned to read that face as they read the pages in Heart Disease and knew when it was safe to ask a question , volunteer an answer , or best melt into nothingness . A steely stare from those blue eyes and bunched eyebrows had pinioned more than one writhing medical student like a butterfly on a tablet . One screwup and handstands for the rest of the year failed to redeem you . <p> Chandler did a few knee bends , toe stands , and flexed his hamstrings , as if preparing for his four-mile morning run , the only luxury he allowed himself . But that kept both his sanity and belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could be exercised . <p> He went to the third drawer of the file cabinet and retrieved two six-inch files bound together by a thick rubber band . The hospital was in the process of digitizing all patient records  --  another computer program he would have to master  --  but was only up to the F 's so far . <p> Damn shame , he thought , unloosening the rubber binding on Purcell 's file and allowing the pages to unfold on his desk . The brilliant young judge , healthy except for his heart , had first been hospitalized , near death , about a year ago with myocarditis . He survived with a scarred shell pumping just enough blood to let him watch the sunset . <p> Chandler had pulled out all the stops to keep the judge from developing heart failure and keep his heart beating in a normal rhythm , as the viral onslaught had tried to undo both . And the judge , accustomed to having his slightest courtroom whim obeyed , ignored Chandler 's stares and raised eyebrows and contested the inevitable transfer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purcell would refuse to undergo tests or take medications he felt were not indicated , based on the modest reading he had done about his disease . Such a patient , Chandler knew , was a major challenge because the little knowledge he accumulated was often incomplete and led to wrong conclusions . Chandler had had to fight a two-front battle , the infection and the judge . Winning both had not endeared him to his patient , and Chandler felt he probably had lost the war . <p> But none of the judge 's power and influence could help him now . They would not get him a new heart or make his old one beat stronger . The most the Judge could hope for was a secondhand heart . Anybody 's  --  black or white , male or female . Purcell would never know where it came from , if it indeed did come in time . <p> As Chandler entered the private room , dark because of the drawn curtains , the judge inched his bony frame straight up in bed and flicked the control box in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . The overhead yellow light illuminated a single white rose , its head drooping , standing in a glass vase on the bureau . The thin pale green cotton blanket that had covered the judge lay in a tangled heap at the foot of the bed just wrapping his feet , and the white sheet was crumpled , revealing a corner of the mattress . A blue silk robe with aubergine trim and matching shawl collar loosely cocooned his body , now shriveled to one hundred thirty pounds . Embroidered on the left upper pocket was a gold crown with a raised crest and the initials HP . The judge 's cheeks were sunken and pale , his brown hair matted on the side where he had been sleeping , despite the hospital dry shampoo . <p> Breathing in short gasps , he confronted Chandler . " I 've counted every one of them , " he said , a deep wet cough interrupting the sentence . " Every damn day for the past two weeks , more than seventy-five people have traipsed in and out of this room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined yellow legal pad from the side tray and waved it in the air , jabbing the list with his finger . " I wrote them all down . " Out of breath , he paused and shook his head , the eyes angry but the look dejected . " And still I wait a half-hour for someone to answer my damn call button to use the commode . Is that any way to run a hospital ? " <p> Chandler walked over to his bed , glanced at the proffered list , and listened while he fogged his glasses and wiped the lenses on the hem of his white coat . Rumor had it that his secretary , to save him time each morning , put on his freshly laundered white coat to free the sleeves and pockets pressed together by the starching and ironing . <p> Purcell shook a fist . " Damn it all , why the hell have n't you gotten me a heart yet ? I 'm sick and tired of this damn place . " <p> Eyebrows bunched , Chandler reached above , grasping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bed and slouched against it . The overhead rings groaned with his weight , and the curtain billowed where he pressed his hip against it , barely supporting him . His expression softened . " I 'm sorry , but there 's a waiting list . Some sicker people are ahead of you . " He pulled a crumpled paper from his top breast pocket and scanned the UNOS list . " Thirty-two to be exact . " <p> Purcell 's eyes widened in disbelief . He clenched his jaw muscles . " So I have to die a little more before I can get a heart ? " <p> " Something like that . " The UNOS system was overloaded with requests for hearts , and there was no way to predict when , or even if a suitable donor would be found for Purcell . The hearts that did become available went to patients with only weeks to live . More than half died waiting for a donor , and Purcell still had at least six months of life . This was the part Chandler both loved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a patient was like giving them a wonderful gift , life itself . Not finding one was death . <p> With an effort that left him winded , the judge slowly bunched his knees up and slid to the side of the bed , feet dangling in search of his slippers . He turned his shoulder from Chandler 's offer of help as his hands groped for the mattress behind , and he pushed off with a slight shove . When he stood , wobbling , the silk robe slipped off his knobby shoulders and fell to the floor before he could catch it . The blue-striped hospital gown , open in the back , exposed cheeks as sunken as those on his face . Unmindful , he tottered the few feet to the dresser and lunged for the drawer handle for support . With the free hand , he groped in the pocket of his hospital johnny , removed a key , unlocked the drawer and took out his checkbook . He turned slowly to face Chandler . " How much ? " he asked , staring the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded his arms across his chest , and returned the gaze . Neither blinked , eyes locked . ' What wo n't help , judge , believe me . You 'd be better off donating it to medical research to develop new treatments with stem cells , mechanical hearts , or even transplants from animals so you and others  --  " <p> The judge pounded the dresser top with his fist , knocking the rose vase to the floor . It shattered , splashing water on his slippers . The rose lay on its side , appearing mortally wounded . " I do n't care about the others , damn it . Right now , I 'm the one who 's dying ! And no one seems to be doing two shits about it ! I 'm a Federal Court judge . Maybe a Supreme Court judge in the next few years , if I live that long . " Breathing fast , he leaned on the dresser , both arms folded on top of it . His lips pursed as he exhaled , trying to hold the air in as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Surely my life is worth more than some John Doe on the street . Ca n't you move my name up on that damn list of yours ? Tell them I 'm sicker ! Tell them I 've got a big trial scheduled . " <p> Chandler put a hand on Purcell 's shoulder , but he brushed it off angrily . " I understand your frustration . I 'm afraid you 'll just have to wait and hope . " <p> " Canned answer . " The judge kicked the shards of the broken vase at his feet , scattering them and rose petals across the floor . " Bullshit advice for a dying man ! If you ca n't do anything more than offer me some crap platitudes , I 'm checking out of here . I 'd rather die in my own home than wait to die in a hospital . " <p> Chandler shrugged . " I do n't advise leaving , but if you want to be discharged , the decision is yours , " he said . <p> The judge 's lips tightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good . I still have control over something . Get me out of here . Now ! " <p> Three months later , Purcell lay in bed in his apartment on Columbus Avenue , staring out of the window as the sun set behind the arches of Lincoln Center . His hair , flecked with gray several months ago , was now almost completely white , and his body , shrunken further by the heart failure  --  cardiac cachexia , the doctors called it  --  was wrapped in wrinkled skin several sizes too big . His bedroom had been converted to an intensive care unit , complete with monitors and alarms . His respirations , pulse rate and blood pressure were telemetered automatically every five minutes  --  immediately , if necessary-to his telephone , and then to the medical center over a secured Web site on the Internet . Special technicians monitored the information and contacted the judge by phone or were prepared to send the emergency team to his apartment if he had problems . <p> Each morning the judge crossed another night off the calendar . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lay awake for hours , suffocating in his own bedroom prison , remembering when he used to fall asleep in minutes . Criminals he sent to jail had more freedom . Forty-one years was not enough for a lifetime . <p> Despite the cashmere sweater and quilt , Purcell shivered . He was afraid . He was a judge , a federal judge , and he was afraid . If a donor did n't show up soon , he 'd probably die of fear instead of heart failure . " Ring , damn you , ring ! " he yelled at the silent phone near his fingertips . <p> His fist struck the goose down pillow just as the first ring of the telephone jangled . The exertion left him breathless , but he almost laughed , thinking , What power . That 's more like it ! But he did n't laugh . He picked up the receiver and held it to his ear . " Well , you 've finally got a heart for me , have n't you ? " <p> " Yes , as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the voice asked in quiet surprise . <p> " I 've got psychic powers . " <p> " Interesting . " <p> Suddenly Purcell realized that the voice was not Chandler 's . There was the slight trace of a foreign accent . " Who is this ? " <p> " That does n't matter . What does , is that you need a new heart . " The caller paused . " I can get one for you . " <p> " Who is this ? " he demanded again , staring at the phone as if he could conjure up the image of the caller . " And what do you mean ' get ' a new heart for me ? Is this some kind of sick joke ? " <p> " Not unless you think your life is a joking matter . " <p> " I 'm listening . " <p> " I was certain you would . It 's quite simple . You need a new heart . I can get it . " <p> " How ? " Purcell asked . <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in your bank account . " <p> " How much do I need ? " <p> " Two million . Cash . " <p> " I have to think about it . " <p> " Of course you do . But I would n't wait too long . There 's a lengthy list of people looking for hearts . " <p> " Where can I reach you ? " <p> " You ca n't . I 'll call back in forty-eight hours . " <p> Purcell stared at the dead receiver in his hand . What the hell was this all about ? Curiosity and a faint glimmer of hope replaced his fear . His heart pounded as he dialed . <p> " David , this is Judge Harcourt Purcell . " <p> " How are you doing ? " Chandler asked . <p> " No worse off than when I was in the hospital . Any news ? " <p> " Nothing , I 'm afraid , but you 're getting close to the top of the list . The last heart donor had a blood type incompatible with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have another anytime . Remember , stay available . When I call , you 'll have to come immediately . " <p> " Yeah , I remember . Beeper 's on . Bag 's packed . I 'm ready , but no place to go . " <p> The caller smiled and crossed off the first red circled name . He checked the next transplant candidate on the UNOS list against a Dun and Bradstreet rating sheet lying on his desk . Bradford was actually number three . Number two had died several days ago . A few minutes later , satisfied with his selection , he dialed . <p> " Bradford Residence . " <p> " Mr. James Bradford , please . " <p> " May I ask who 's calling ? " <p> " It 's a medical matter . " <p> " Are you a doctor ? " <p> " A friend . " He paused . " Can I talk to him , please ? " <p> " I do n't know if I should . " <p> " Look , I do n't have much time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . " <p> Over the phone the caller heard her knock softly and say , " Mr. Bradford , sir , there 's someone on the phone . Says it 's a medical matter . " CHAPTER TWO <p> It was cold and dark under the West Side Highway overpass at night ; dampness at the end of a rainy winter day seeped into your marrow . They huddled around the fire blazing in a rusted oil drum , yellow flames reflected in their eyes , fumes from passing cars filling their lungs . Their shoulders hunched against the wind swirling through the underpass , ragged coats offering little protection against its bite . Piles of sooty snow near the base of the drum melted into tiny rivulets that carved miniature chasms in the dirt and dampened their shoes . The future for New York City 's homeless was as threatening as the winter sky above . Overhead , oblivious drivers sped by in heated cars , Christmas carols blasting from their radios . Few cared whether these shadow people lived or died , or how they did either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest and arms filling out the heavy plaid jacket with raised collar . Beneath a broad-rimmed light gray hat , dark curls fell in loose ringlets , almost hiding his mahogany eyes . A patchy beard , several days old , further darkened his swarthy complexion and helped cover cheeks that looked stamped by a waffle iron . He walked with a shambling gait , clutching the neck of an opened liquor bottle stuffed into a brown paper bag beneath his coat . Beyond the skirt of the fire 's light , he paused in the flickering shadows and appraised the group , his right eye twitching . <p> A toothless old man , chin studded with whitish bristles , and his fat female companion , with an equal amount of beard reflecting off the flames , were of no interest to him . They leaned shoulders against each other for balance , propping each other up . Drawing nearer , he inspected the remaining threesome , two men in their early twenties and a girl no older than fifteen or sixteen . No one spoke as they stared vacantly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swallowed the licorice stick held like a cigarette between his lips and cautiously entered the circle of warmth around the drum . He slipped in near the girl , arousing little curiosity until he raised the brown parcel to his lips . <p> Across the fire , the old man looked up , gumming a toothpick , eyes glittering . " What you got in that bottle ? " he asked , anticipating an entry fee for a share of the fire . <p> " Gin . Good kind . Gordon 's . " The stranger offered the bottle . <p> A withered hand , shaking from the early stages of DTs , reached across the flames and grabbed the paper bag . In the same jerky motion , he raised the bottle to his lips . The fire light shown through his skin like parchment . Slowly he lowered it with a contented " ahhh " and raised his head , looking at the stranger with an unsteady gaze . <p> " Who 're you ? " he asked . <p> " Name 's Johnny . Do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of this fire . " The alert eyes and timbre in his voice resonated vigor foreign to those around the fire . Palm outward , he held up a beefy hand . " Keep it . I can get more . " <p> With a satisfied grunt , the old man hugged the bottle for a moment as if the glass itself could warm him , before handing it to the fat lady standing beside him . He grabbed the sleeve of her grease-stained yellow coat , steaming from the fire 's heat , and steered her away from the circle toward the dim outline of a cardboard shelter tucked back in the shadows at the base of the bridge . The effort caused them both to pant a little , sending small clouds of breath into the night air . <p> Suddenly one of the young men started to cry , heavy sobs shaking his narrow chest . " No more . We got no more . " He buried his face in his hands . <p> " It 's OK . We 'll get some , " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just above the gold earring , and pressed the beardless cheek against his chest . " I said I 'd take care of you , did n't I ? " <p> The intruder distanced himself from the couple and edged closer to the teenager . The top of her head reached only to his midchest and he thought that size might be a problem . Despite street grime and a runny nose , she was pretty . Her black ski jacket with hood was of good quality , and tendrils of brown hair that escaped confinement fell over her face . With a sideways glance , he noted her constricted pupils and vacant expression . She had probably shot up recently and AIDS from a dirty needle was possible , but he could n't return empty-handed this time . Not again . <p> Decision made , he reached into his pocket and withdrew two cellophane packets of white powder , holding them up for the young men to see . " They 're yours if you stop your damn crying and get the hell out of here . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take your girlfriend and disappear before I change my mind , " Johnny said . <p> Pausing only to wipe his tear-streaked face , the young man snatched the packets and ran toward a dilapidated brick building , pulling his friend behind him . <p> Now alone with the young girl , he faced her . " What 's your name ? " <p> She gazed into the fire . <p> " I said what 's your name ? " he repeated , squeezing her shoulder . <p> She jerked her shoulder free . <p> " Take it easy . I just thought you might want to make some money . " <p> She turned her head , brown eyes wary , but interested . " Why , you got some ? " <p> " Yeah , plenty . " <p> " How much ? Let me see . " <p> With eyes fixed on his hands , she watched him reach into his pocket and unfurl a wad of bills . He peeled off a fifty and placed it in her outstretched palm . <p> By flame light , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocketing the money and focusing on him . " My name 's Shawn . " <p> No longer shuffling , Johnny Trasanto draped an arm over her unresisting shoulders and guided his young recruit away from the fire . As they faded into the darkness , a boy approached from the opposite direction and shouted . Hearing her name , Shawn looked back , but the pressure of Trasanto 's hand in the small of her back propelled her to his car and they drove off . <p> Untended , the flames gradually died and the rats crept from their hiding places to reclaim their rightful space in the shadows beneath the West Side Highway overpass . <p> The twin-engine Beechcraft touched down on the runway deep in the Adirondack Mountains north of Saranac Lake in upstate New York . The runway lights illuminated tall , green pine trees , branches sagging with layers of snow , which lined the landing area and surrounded the small wood hangar with a sign in brown and green lettering : Saranac Lake Resort . Their dark-green colors blended into the wooded landscape , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear of the plane on a stretcher bed that replaced the two back seats . Her restraints Were slack . The Dalmane injection , intended for a much larger person , produced a deep and restful slumber . She snored lightly and a thread of drool trickled from her open mouth . She still wore her ski jacket but was covered by a heavy down orange quilt . Tiny beads of perspiration sprinkled her forehead . <p> In the early morning mist , a brown van with no lettering and dimmed headlights backed up to the airplane . Two medical attendants carefully lifted the stretcher out of the plane and set it in the back of the van . The doors to the van swung shut and the vehicle sped away . <p> Over the next four hours while she slept , Shawn underwent a thorough physical examination . Blood samples drawn for chemistries , drugs , toxins , and HIV revealed a surprisingly healthy young lady . Just a trace of gonorrhea and body lice . <p> Ten hours later , Shawn stirred . Remembering the last bed she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tight ball . The man had been so brutal ; she could barely walk for days . Her slim thighs still were sore and the black and blue marks had faded to a dull banana yellow . She stretched her arm across the wide expanse of bed and slowly relaxed her fetal curve . <p> It had been a long time since she had occupied a bed , at least a clean bed , alone . From habit , she scratched her head before realizing that it did n't itch . The mites and lice were gone , and her brown hair spread over the pillowcase had a new richness and smelled of coconut . Her body tingled and she explored beneath the pink and white hospital gown , now bunched around her hips . Her fingers traveled down her legs , lingering in confusion on the smooth shaved skin . She touched her groin and pulled her hand back . Bare ! Even her underarms had been shaved . <p> Drawing her knees up to her chest , she wrapped her arms around them and noticed a Band-Aid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and gently poked the tiny round blood clot congealed over a needle hole . She read her name and blood type on the plastic ID bracelet that circled her left wrist . <p> Her room was small , barely big enough to hold her bed , a painted pink dresser with an attached mirror , a nightstand , and a chair . Everything was clean and smelled of antiseptic . Patches of sunlight squeezed through the slats of a small shuttered window that concealed metal bars . The painted off-white walls were barren except for a small pair of framed landscapes of a blue lake surrounded by dark-green pine trees . Shawn jumped as the door to the room swung silently open and a nurse entered , carrying a tray of covered dishes . <p> " Good morning . I hope you slept well . How do you feel today ? " <p> The high cheekbones and blonde hair twisted into a French braid at the back of her head reminded Shawn of her mother . But broad Bostonian R 's replaced her mother 's South Carolina drawl . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A rehabilitation center . One of our special missionaries brought you here last night . " <p> Silently , Shawn 's eyes followed the tray . <p> " Hungry ? " the nurse asked , placing it on the night stand . <p> Shawn nodded . <p> One by one , the nurse removed the lids from the plates . Eggs . Pancakes . Bacon . Toast . Fresh orange juice . " Refills of anything you want . I 'll be back later . " <p> Shawn waited until the nurse left , then tore into the golden pancakes , thick brown maple syrup dripping down her chin . Her tongue chased the droplets . Between mouthfuls , she gulped the orange juice , not noticing the slightly bitter aftertaste . <p> Before finishing the last bite of eggs and toast , she fell asleep again . <p> Shawn did n't hear the nurse return thirty minutes later to gently refasten the body restraints , locking the door as she left . Shawn would sleep until lunchtime . This routine would be repeated three times a day until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her young body .
