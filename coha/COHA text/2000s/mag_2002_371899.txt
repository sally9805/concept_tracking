When a country succumbs to demands to release a captured terrorist , it can not know what price it will later pay . In the case of Maulana Masood Azhar , India thinks it knows now . In 1999 Azhar  --  at the time a leader of the radical militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen  --  was in an Indian jail on charges of carrying a fake passport , when masked gunmen hijacked an Indian Airlines jet to Afghanistan and demanded that India free him and two comrades . To protect the lives of the 155 passengers , New Delhi acquiesced . And now , India believes , Azhar , 34 , as head of Jaish-e-Muhammad ( Army of Muhammad ) , is partly responsible for the Dec. 13 attack on its Parliament by five suicidal militants . It was his arrest  --  and that of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed , leader of the other party India blames , Lashkar-e-Taiba ( Army of the Pure )  --  that New Delhi demanded and won from Pakistan last week . <P> It was n't Azhar 's first time in a Pakistani cell . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he returned to his native land after India released him . Within weeks , he was in Karachi delivering fanatical speeches and exhorting several thousand armed supporters to destroy India and the U.S. Azhar joined hands with a hard-line Sunni sectarian group and broke away from Harkat-ul-Mujahideen to found the even more fanatical Jaish-e-Muhammad . His new group was the first to favor suicide attacks in India . It has been responsible for grenade and car-bomb assaults on civilian targets , and took responsibility for a devastating bomb blast at the state legislature in Indian-administered Kashmir last October . <P> No less threatening , but more scholarly and sophisticated , is Saeed , 54 . The charismatic red-bearded Islamic-studies professor is Lashkar-e-Taiba 's main ideologue . Born in 1947 during his family 's flight from northern India during Partition , Saeed memorized the Koran as a boy . He fought briefly in the Afghan jihad against the U.S.S.R. and in 1986 founded the Markaz Ad-Da'wah Wal Irshad , a religious education and proselytizing organization . Lashkar spun off two years later , attracting veterans of the Afghan war . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but says it never targets civilians . Nevertheless , two civilians and one soldier died in its December 2000 attack on Delhi 's landmark Red Fort . <P> Pakistani officials say it 's too soon to know whether the two militant leaders will face trial or eventually be released . Either way , it 's doubtful that Pakistan  --  or India  --  has heard the last of them . <P>  --  With reporting by Ghulam Hasnain/Muzaffarabad
