<p> Ask Seimone Augustus a pointed question , and she 'll greet it with a pause . <p> A hesitation later , she 'll blow you away with an answer akin to the way she has swooped past defenders in becoming the most decorated player in LSU women 's basketball history . <p> " I 'm mentally tougher . That 's where my advantage comes from , " says the 6-1 swing player of her cerebral approach . " My dad made me play against a lot of men . Men are stronger , faster and they can jump higher . So you have to think . " <p> She led LSU ( 27-3 ) to the last two Final Fours and consecutive Southeastern Conference regular-season championships , a conference tournament championship in 2003 , its first-ever victory at Tennessee this season and another No.1 seed for the NCAA tournament . <p> It 's her smarts , she says , as much as her deceptive athleticism that earned Augustus the 2005 Wooden Award and Wade Trophy as the nation 's most outstanding player . She 's among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( first nationally ) for the No.5-ranked team in the nation . <p> The missing piece : a national championship . Her last chance to complete her cycle of accomplishments begins Saturday vs . Florida Atlantic en route to the Final Four in Boston on April2 and 4 . <p> Augustus ponders the urgency . Then , with the same calm she exhibits on the floor  --  whether her team is winning or losing by 20 or she 's giving a textbook upfake on a 20-footer to drive inside  --  she shoots . <p> " I look at it as the same this year as other years . Everybody has the opportunity to win , " says Augustus , the only guard ranked among the NCAA 's top shooters , at 57.8% ( 15th nationally ) , even though she plays as more of a small forward in a motion offense . <p> " I would still be happy with my career here if I did n't win it . It 's nothing to be upset about . There are a lot of other milestones I have achieved . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Augustus has started every game ( a school-record 135 ) during her four years as LSU has gone 117-18 . But the postseason has not been so pleasant . <p> When the surprise Tigers advanced to the Final Four in 2004 , Augustus had a stellar run before the team lost 52-50 to Tennessee . The then-sophomore averaged 24.8 points in the NCAAs while shooting more than 61% from the field  --  despite going 7-for-21 in the loss to the Lady Vols . <p> The Tigers were No.1 most of last season and were favored to win their first championship , but they blew a 15-point lead in the first half of their NCAA semifinal against eventual champion Baylor . Augustus went 10-for-26 in that game and shot 46% for the tournament . <p> She 's down to her last chance to win a championship , and it 's expected to be more difficult . <p> Augustus is still paired with one of the best centers in the country in 6-6 sophomore Sylvia Fowles , yet Fowles does n't have a strong backup . LSU also has an inexperienced point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a one-and-one in the waning seconds of LSU 's 63-62 loss to Tennessee in the SEC tournament title game  --  the second year in a row LSU has lost that game to the Lady Vols . <p> The Tigers ' three losses have been by a total of five points . <p> " This team has done some things better than last year 's team , " says second-year coach Pokey Chatman , who lost offensive threat and All-America point guard Temeka Johnson to graduation . " The difference is we do n't have the same margin of error . We do n't have depth . " <p> But they have Augustus . <p> Persistence pays off vs . Tennessee <p> Pat Summitt saw it in Chamique Holdsclaw , the leading scorer in Tennessee history with 3,025 points . Holdsclaw sparked a 10-loss team to a championship in 1996-97 , one of three consecutive national titles for the Lady Vols . <p> The same refuse-to-lose grit that Holdsclaw exhibited came to fore with Augustus on Feb.9 , when she willed the Tigers to victory against Summitt 's team : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut to the basket to receive a pass from Fowles for a layup at 1:54 . <p> *She made a key assist to Fowles for a layup with 15 seconds remaining for a 72-69 lead that became the final score . <p> *She blocked a three-point attempt by the Vols ' Dominique Redding from the baseline with seven seconds left . <p> *She hawked Shanna Zolman , the Vols ' best long-range shooter , and blocked her three-point attempt with two seconds remaining . <p> The result spelled victory for LSU and ended Tennessee 's 64-game conference winning streak at Thompson-Boiling Arena . It was the Tigers ' first road victory there in 17 tries en route to another SEC regular-season title . <p> " That 's what great players do , " Summitt says of Augustus , who averaged 27 points in her last 13 games . " She 's taken their team to a different level . <p> " She 's developed her stuff as a big-game player . Her composure is there . With her shooting touch , she 's extended her range . She gets into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season . " <p> And to top it off with a national title ? <p> " Me and other teammates were talking about it some days ago , " Fowles says . " That 's our goal , to send ( Augustus ) out with a win . If we do n't accomplish that , nothing else is going to matter . " <p> Unconventional teaching methods <p> It 's the subtle things that make Augustus special . She excels in Chatman 's motion offense , which puts a premium on screening and floor balance to free up the movers . <p> Augustus knows when to back cut , when to curl , when to flare . Her jump shot  --  which sometimes incorporates an innate backward lean in her upper torso that makes it almost impossible to disrupt as she elevates  --  is as smooth as her gait . <p> Chatman insists it 's not the system that makes Augustus so successful , just the opposite . <p> " She 's everyone 's national player of the year last year , so she 's going to garner the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always ask , " Chatman says . " Why is she always open for the 15-footer ? <p> " Most players are better with the ball in their hands . She 's by far the best basketball player I 've seen  --  man , woman or child  --  without the ball . And she 's excellent off the dribble . " <p> Augustus says , " I try to get the best shot possible , mostly around the painted area . I do n't let people dictate where I get my shot . I dictate . Mostly it 's going to be inside the arc . If I can see myself getting to the paint , that 's what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to make the right read or the right cut . " <p> For that she can thank , in part , her father , for his rather unconventional method of teaching her basketball . <p> Duct tape or a belt , blindfolds and a glove . Seymore Augustus was teaching his daughter how to perform a different kind of magic . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conventional , fundamentally sound basketball player as early as 5 . <p> The belt and tape held one arm behind her back so she could learn to dribble with her left hand . The blindfold was so she would break the habit of watching the ball . The bowling glove did n't allow her to rest the ball in the palm of her hands so she could shoot properly , with her fingertips . <p> Her temperament comes from years of playing at recreational centers , where she was challenged mentally  --  as much as physically  --  by boys and men . Managing the psychological warfare was paramount . <p> " It 's the community she was raised up in , " her father says of the Eden Park section of Baton Rouge . " Those guys were physical to you . I always told her , ' Do n't let your enemies know they 're getting next to you . Beat them on the court and you got the last laugh . ' " <p> Modest about her talents <p> His teachings are evident in his daughter 's discretionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more demonstrative , she 's careful to be under control . She has shown three-point range  --  she 's 51.5% from behind the arc  --  but has taken only 33 such shots . <p> For Chatman , the chance to coach a player she scouted as early as middle school has been totally rewarding  --  even if a national title is n't realized . <p> " When you think about the elevation of women 's basketball at LSU and the stage that she 's played on , she 's such an ambassador of the sport and respects the game so much , " Chatman says . " She transcends race and gender . It 's the totality of Seimone that captures your attention . " <p> Fowles says , " She 's very humble . She does n't let her talent and her skills get to her head . She 's taught me so much , just by pushing me in practice . She may not seem like she talks much , but she does talk a lot on the floor and in her body language and leading by example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never thought his daughter 's on-court acumen would be parlayed into such reverence . <p> " Seimone is not a hot-head jock . Seimone is nonchalant . Nothing matters to her . She 's a child trapped inside a grown folk 's body , " says Seymore , who was joined by his wife , Kim , and Seimone 's Chihuahua , Tootsie Baby , on Senior Day on Feb.26 , Seimone 's last game at Maravich Assembly Center . " A lot of people may not know who she is , but when they meet her they say , ' Hey , she 's cool . ' <p> " I never knew she would turn out to be this good . But I now know for sure she 's heaven-sent . " PHOTO , B/W , Bill Feig , AP
