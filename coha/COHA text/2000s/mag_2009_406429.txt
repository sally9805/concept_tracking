How to remain calm in an anxious state . EDITED BY DAVID MASELLO ILLUSTRATION BY MICHAEL WITTE Relax ! If ever a word did n't demand an exclamation point , that one 's it . I do n't know about you , but I ca n't relax in the imperative . A comma , maybe , as in " Relax , and let me pour you a glass of Chardonnay . " I can even kick back in the gerund : " How about relaxing in my pool ? " But instructing me to " relax ! " is about as useless as telling a person with a bad diagnosis to " cheer up ! " It 's just not going to happen . This year for my birthday , my sister-in-law gave me a facial at a well-known establishment on the West Side of Manhattan . When I walked in , I was immediately told to strip to the waist , put on a raisin-colored gown and take my seat in a room of barely clothed women who were reclining in what looked to be dentists ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had white masks painted on their faces . There were mud-brown streaks on their upper lips and cotton balls over their eyes . The place was dimly lit and looked as if it had n't had a paint job since the Elvis years . For a moment I thought I was in a wax museum . So it was with some trepidation that I sat in my appointed seat and lay back . " Relax ! " said the woman who pulled up a stool next to my head . She was wearing a diaphanous white smock and made no effort to disguise the onions on her breath . " I am relaxing , " I whispered to her . " This is it ? This is the best you can do ? " She jabbed her finger against my forehead . " You 'll never relax if you ca n't turn this off , " she scolded . " Come on , now . Think of this as a mini vacation . " Being a competitive person , I tried . I wanted to relax better than anyone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes and unclenched my teeth . I breathed slowly and visualized the ocean . Finally , no thanks to her , I slipped into something resembling a soporific state . What else are you going to do when someone massages your head for twenty minutes , then immobilizes your face with Crisco ( or something like it ) ? Yet every twenty minutes or so , she 'd rub my shoulders and make disapproving clucking sounds , and I 'd be reminded that my relaxing efforts were not up to par . In fairness to the woman in the diaphanous smock , if you saw me you would n't think I looked very relaxed either . Even at my most serene , I look startled . I am thin , with boingy curls and eyes that I 'll call eager . I walk fast and talk faster . Once when I was a kid , I was hypnotized as part of the poolside entertainment at a Miami Beach hotel . When the hypnotist got me to the point where I seemed subdued , he told me to let my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , semiconscious , I hurtled forward and nearly knocked myself out against the diving board . And so it has gone all my life . I do n't suffer this alone . In my homeland of New York City , there are thousands of us roaming the streets , bug-eyed and alert . We do n't mock those who walk around in dreamlike states with half smiles on their faces . ( I wo n't name names , but Boulder , Colorado , I am talking to you ! ) So why should we be objects of their derision ? Not long ago I went to a spa in the West where I took a tennis clinic . What I lack in style or talent in tennis , I make up for in being scrappy and chasing down every ball . After a few minutes of watching me , the instructor , a suspiciously neat fellow with a perfect tan and pristine tennis shoes , shouted to me in front of everyone , " Hey , Miss New York , you 're allowed to slow down once in a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stupor the moment he sits down in a theater or spies a couch , has said to me more than once : " Whoa , Sparky . Try the decaf ! " Of course , all this ridicule and bullying works to reinforce one thing : agitation . So those of you who worry about the likes of me living life at too hyper a pace , I say to you : calm down . And here are some suggestions for helping even the most frenetic of us chill out without even knowing we 're doing it . 1 . Smile when you meet us . Charge the air with friendliness . No one can resist a warm bath . 2 . Make eye contact . Tell us how good we look or that you like our blouse or hairdo , even if you do n't mean it . We 'll believe you , and you 'll feel much better about yourself . 3 . Say something funny . Not lawyer-and-a-lightbulb funny , but something that takes into account the tenseness of the situation . A friend of mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees come to interview with her , they will often call her Mrs. Becker . My friend will answer : " Mrs. Becker is my mother . You can call me Alice . " Self-deprecating humor lets us know you 're aware of our discomfort and you 're able to put yourself in our place . 4 . Ask us questions to draw us out . " Why are you so tense ? " is not a good one . In the case of the facial lady , " What brings you here today ? " would have done for starters . If you 're meeting us for the first time , ask about our background , our interests , where we 're from originally . A friend of mine likes to give dinner parties for women only . She usually invites women who do n't know one another and inevitably begins the dinner with a provocative question , such as " What 's the one thing you 've always wanted to do in your life but have n't done yet ? " or " What has been your greatest achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roomful of nervous strangers has become an intimate group of new friends . 5 . Let us see a more human or vulnerable side to you . Talk about your dog or cat . Same for children . Or share an experience . Or wear something that reveals your personality . I recently had to have an unpleasant medical procedure . My surgeon , a woman , was wearing a pearl necklace and a pearl bracelet . When I told her that I found her jewelry reassuring , she answered : " I know I get nervous when I have to have procedures with unpronounceable names , so I like to make it more comfortable for both of us . The jewelry helps . " 6 . If we know another person in common , let 's chat about her . Nothing odious , of course . But sharing some information about her new job , or a trip she recently took , will bridge the discomfort between the two of us. 7 . Offer food : nuts , cheese and crackers , a little dip maybe . It will engender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nerves . 8 . If I seem tense to you , I probably am . So , please , do n't tell me to relax . There , I feel calmer already . Do n't you ? ASK US your most pressing question about proper etiquette and modern-day behavior . We 'll try to answer it in a future " Social Graces " column . Write to us at tnc@hearst.com.
