Susan Tabak is a personal shopper  --  a really personal shopper . For $1,500 a day , she 'll take you and your friends to the chic boutiques in Paris and make sure you get the treatment from the snooty sales assistants that your hard-earned greenbacks deserve . But just in case you do n't have an extra few thousand to unload , here are some of her secrets . They should work at the mall too : <P> 1 Do n't wear sneakers . They 're a giveaway that you 're a tourist and invite inferior service . <P> 2 Carry a designer 's shopping bag with you , even if you have to borrow one . It will give you shopping credibility . On the off chance that you buy something , have the store send it to your hotel . <P> 3 You do n't have to speak French to get good service . Just say , " Bonjour , madame , " and smile broadly as you walk in ; they 'll think you mean business . <P> 4 If you run out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a designer store such as Chanel , Prada or Yves Saint Laurent , sit down , and ask for a glass of water . " They 'll happily oblige , " says Tabak . <P> 5 Parisian storekeepers work reasonable hours . They shut their doors at 7 every weeknight and are closed all day Sunday . <P> 6 Finally , for an only-in-Paris shopping experience , try to snag an appointment at Anouschka ( 33-148-743-700 ) or E2 ( 33-147-701-514 ) , two out-of-the-way vintage boutiques.
