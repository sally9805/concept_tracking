When you are trying to understand a particularly elusive artist , take a look at what the art world was like when he or she was in the mid to late 20s . Chances are good that a significant part of that person 's artistic vision was forged then , in the period when schooling ended and a professional career began . In the case of William Carlson that would take us to the middle and late 1970s . Among the many things happening at that moment was a transition in abstract sculpture from the cool detachment of Minimalism to the more process-oriented and experiential abstraction of post-Minimalism . Artists such as Richard Serra , Jackie Winsor , Christopher Wimarth and more , following other artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were reintroducing a sense of labor and layering into their abstract pieces . Pristine surfaces were replaced by something grittier and rough-hewn , more about the search for form than about beauty and resolve . For much of his career William Carlson stayed close to what might be called enhanced Minimalism . His crisp freestanding abstract sculptures of glass and granite , often embedded with colorful slices of Vitrolite , were beautiful and resolved . They were skilled and elegant investigations of the ceaselessly compelling intersections of the triangle , the rectangle and the circle as manifested in the wedge , the trapezoid and the sphere . Carlson bejeweled the world with these sculptures for 20 years , before ceasing their production in 2000 . Why ? It was due partly to the stimulation of the communicative challenges in several commissions he undertook for monumental public sculpture . It was also an inbred predilection to test his abilities that led Carlson to pursue his recent works : wall reliefs that function as a contemporary Rosetta Stone , a curious and compelling conflation of systems of communication , a layering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just be offering us the Rosetta Stone at its most interesting moment , say , the week before it was " solved . " What links Latin vocabulary and corrugated cardboard ? What is the connection between an indistinct grid and rope patterns ? Why do these works seem so determined to hold themselves together while being assailed by forces that seem to drive them apart ?

In his studio Carlson casts rough-hewn cubes or tiles of articulated glass that , after some grinding and polishing , he slices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own small universe , linked to its brethren , but intriguingly independent , refusing fully to disappear into the larger construct . Often Carlson will have bits of Latin text collaged within these tiles , peeking through the layers of glass over them . These fragments are not quotations , but rather snippets of words , depicted in different fonts , simultaneously recognizable and unintelligible . Latin is a dead language that refuses fully to die  --  a symbol of erudition , an outmoded form of communication with all the trappings of discourse except access . ( Carlson is an academic and has taught sculpture at the University of Illinois , Champaign/Urbana for many years . ) The Latin seems to function like highly keyed visual clutter , but it is important to Carlson that we see it as sign , as information we must somehow process . Over these fragments of discombobulated text Carlson sets a combed corrugated surface , an insistent cardboard-like pattern that itself is likely to be intersected with another ridge-like interruption . This layers the Latin ( as does time ) to the realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cumulative effect of these tiles , their aggregate composition , provides an interesting link to late Minimalism , with a breakdown in the positivist reading of geometric abstraction . The tenacity of the parallel glass ridges is mesmerizing , with a pattern that approaches cross-hatching . The tiles are usually split or obliquely shaped , forming yet another pattern that wo n't lie down quietly . These wall installations retain the structure of a grid while refusing to fulfill the order and rationality it promises . They become metaphors for Carlson 's entire project , an experiential challenge to orthodoxy and clarity . They reflect his obsession with the infinite gaps between idea , execution and comprehension , between " reading " and " understanding . " They are both frustrating and wise . Carlson 's color scheme is muted and restrained , a rust-zone palette that moves toward dry reds and browns only partially relieved by hints of blue and green .

These , too , offer a language of sorts ; the grids here are more stable , and the knots and ligatures line up to suggest a pictographic alphabet , as if these are somehow coded , translatable into text that we are just not trained to read . They also suggest an inventory of knotting techniques , as if culled from a sea-farer 's manual . All this hinting at rope and binding gives these works physical aura and presence . Rope is a tool used to connect things , to bind potentially disparate elements , perhaps a metaphor for the way our brain always tries to tie things together . There are moments with Carlson 's recent work when we feel the presence of a language we can not fully translate , but we respond to its rhythms and patterns . This is , after all , art-and it calls for an aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and react to compelling visual analogues of the processes of communication rather than " read " an end result . Here 's yet another trade secret . One way to think about art that it will always do one of two things-either confirm what you know about the world or invite you to extend that knowledge . It offers you an affirmation of a fairly stable universe or it will ask you to go somewhere else , a place where the " givens " that hold us together begin to wobble . William Carlson is drawn to the latter position , and his ultimate success resides in the range of questions he is determined to raise , with meaning endlessly deferred . Sidebar Each component is its own small universe , linked to its brethren , but intriguingly independent , refusing fully to disappear into the larger construct .
