This era in our public life seems sure to be remembered for its frequent outbursts of political and legal hysteria  --  round-the-clock , cable-televised scrums of lawyers , pols and pundits scuffling over the latest Great American Court Case . First O.J. , then Bill and Monica , and finally , in 2000 , Elian and then George W. vs . Al . Maybe it 's fitting that both of this year 's courthouse telethons played out in South Florida  --  the sun-bleached , strip-malled , multicultural face of America 's future . <P> For the first six months , the nation argued the fate of Elian Gonzalez , the 6-year-old miracle child rescued off the Florida coast after a shipwreck had killed his mother and 10 others as they fled Cuba . The argument boiled down to family vs. freedom  --  was the boy better off in Cuba with his father or in Miami with relatives ?  --  and vented long-dormant cold war-era passions . The boy and his father finally returned to Cuba in June , but the argument lives on . <P> For the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore two presidential candidates , George W. Bush and Al Gore , who insisted there were big issues at stake . Instead of paying attention to them , most folks watched some fascinating scenes roll past : thousands of anti-globalization protesters disrupting a World Bank conference in Washington ; Ford and Firestone executives blaming one another for a string of auto fatalities ; Bill Clinton taking a last , slow lap around the presidential track as his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton made her first successful run for public office . Finally , the presidential campaign that everyone thought was boring suddenly became all too interesting . The election ran aground in Florida , its outcome simply too close to call , a digital-photo-finish that defeated the state 's analog voting equipment ( and meanwhile added a 1950s term , punch-card " chad , " to our lexicon ) . The cable-TV pundits made their dependable racket and protesters filled the South Florida streets , but as the votes were recounted and Gore contested Bush 's apparent victory , the public remained admirably patient  --  content to let this truly important episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is still capable of serious thought . <P>  --  Eric Pooley <P> A Night to Remember , Part I
