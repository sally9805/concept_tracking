The high hopes for democratic change in Iran seem to be dead , at least for now . Iran 's leading reformist party announced last week that it would boycott the Feb. 20 elections to choose a new parliament , charging that a panel dominated by hard-line mullahs had effectively rigged the outcome by disqualifying some 2,000 potential candidates , most of them reformists . The move capped a month-long drama marked by the resignation of 87 reformist parliament members in protest . After attempting to mediate a compromise , Supreme Leader Ayatullah Ali Khamenei came down firmly on the side of the conservatives . Calling reformists " ignorant people " who parroted " the enemies of this nation , " he sternly refused to reverse the disqualifications or delay the balloting " even by one day . " <P> Iran 's conservatives are now expected to sweep back into parliament , four years after losing control of the 290-seat Assembly to supporters of reformist President Mohammed Khatami . That would set the stage for a possible conservative victory in next year 's election to choose Khatami 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bracing for a poor showing in the voting because of widespread public disillusionment over the failure of reform . After plastering his vehicle with pro-Khatami posters three years ago , Tehran taxi driver Arash Khaqani , 27 , endured a beating by hard-line thugs . Now , he says , " I would n't support anyone 's campaign so enthusiastically . " In fact , he is not planning to vote at all on Feb. 20 . <P> The reformists ' boycott is , in a sense , a strategic withdrawal . " It is better to side with the people than to cling to power , " Khatami 's brother Reza , leader of the largest reformist party , told TIME . " The next parliament will be undemocratic , but that does n't mean democracy in Iran has failed . " Maybe not , but judging by the election fiasco , its success is still a long way off . <P>  --  By Scott MacLeod
