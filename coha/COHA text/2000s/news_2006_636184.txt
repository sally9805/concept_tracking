<p> From Australia , Venezuela , Africa , Europe , Asia and all 50 states , students flock to Chicago with sweet learning on their minds . They come to study sculpture , that is , the art of chocolate and gum paste . Mathematics , the formulae of recipes . Horticulture , the forms of frosting flowers , and architecture , or rather , the structure of wedding cake . They leave prepared to work as bakers , pastry chefs , confectioners and cake decorators at retail stores , restaurants , hotels , caterers and even hospitals and schools around the world . <p> Most of the international students come to attend one of two schools , each unique in this country : The Wilton School of Cake Decorating and Confectionery Art in far west suburban Darien and the French Pastry School in Chicago , where both offer highly specialized curricula on creating beautiful desserts . Several of Chicago 's general culinary schools also offer concentrations in baking and pastry arts , which mainly attract students from the Midwest . <p> In general , these programs aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing a ton of increase in the need for chefs , " said Tim Lemberger , spokesman for the Illinois Institute of Art-Chicago . It 's estimated that the foodservice industry will need 3 million more professionals by 2010 . <p> Asked whether IIA 's 44-week pastry program also was suitable for lay enthusiasts , Lemberger paused . " Well , it 's for the dedicated hobbyist , " he said . <p> Some schools , such as Kendall College and Wilton , do offer noncredit classes and workshops accessible to home cooks , and the French Pastry School identifies some of its guest-chef series as suitable for food enthusiasts . <p> The Wilton School began in 1929 when pulled-sugar artist Dewey McKinley Wilton began teaching classes in his Chicago home . It 's part of Wilton Industries , which manufactures cake-decorating supplies . The core program is a two-week class culminating in the creation of a wedding cake . <p> " It 's a really great way to study the specifics of cake design , " said Mark Seaman , proprietor of Marked for Dessert , a sought-after Chicago sweets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libertyville . Seaman studied at the Cooking and Hospitality Institute of Chicago but went on to take a variety of courses at Wilton . He now teaches at Wilton and other local culinary schools , as well as taking interns . " The classes at culinary schools do n't have enough emphasis on decorating , " Seaman said . <p> Wilton 's programs are the shortest offered by local dessert schools  --  its core session lasts two weeks . Although director Sandy Folsom said visiting students often stay longer to take additional workshops and shorter courses , which include classes from visiting instructors like Colette Peters , a New York cake stylist who 's authored several books , and seminars on advanced techniques such as lambeth , a British decorating form . Students are a mix of professionals brushing up on techniques , baking-career aspirants and avid amateurs . <p> The French Pastry School , established in 1995 by two award-winning French-born pastry chefs , Jacquy Pfeiffer and Sebastien Canonne , both veterans of European and Chicago hotels , offers an intensive 24-week concentration on pastry , as well as shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pulled sugar . The school will hold an open house on Aug. 26 . <p> This term the school 's enrollment is 95 percent women , said Anne Kauffmann , the French Pastry School 's spokeswoman . Students are a mix of culinary pros adding to their pastry knowledge , budding chefs and people changing careers , she said . Graduates typically start out as pastry assistants and advance to pastry chefs . <p> Shannon Smith , 32 , a former Chicago financial adviser , left her career to study baking last year . After an abortive effort at one of the general cooking schools , she enrolled at the French Pastry School . Since February , she 's been happily baking at Payard Patisserie &; Bistro on New York City 's Upper East Side . " I love it , " she said . <p> Although she 'd always been an avid baker , Smith had no formal culinary training before her career switch . " I was looking for something new . I was sitting on my sofa one day  --  and I was munching on some croissants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I had an epiphany . <p> " I took out loans and I just kind of went for it . " <p> She 's thrilled about what she learned at the French Pastry School . " Just in the six months I 've been working , " she said , " I can set myself apart from my colleagues . <p> " I 'm using my mind all the time . " <p> Smith said she particularly liked learning the theory behind the procedures and processes along with the hands-on instruction . <p> Deciding which school is best depends a student 's time , money and goals , Seaman said . " It 's a very personal decision . They should visit each one and consider what do you want to do after you gain your skills ? " <p> For $1,000 or so , students can spend a few weeks at Wilton and come away with training sufficient to work as a cake decorator at a supermarket . Or a student can spend $100,000 and four years at Kendall College and come away with a bachelor 's degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bakery of a major hotel . <p> " We 're preparing students for leadership positions , " said Christopher Koetke , dean of Kendall 's School of Culinary Arts . <p> City of Chicago residents without such deep pockets might want to turn to Washburne Culinary Institute , once the cooking-school arm of Chicago Public Schools ' Washburne Trade School and now operated by the City Colleges of Chicago . Tuition is lower there because of the program 's state and city subsidies , Provost William Reynolds said . The school offers several baking and pastry programs , including a new associate degree , for which tuition costs $13,000 . <p> Reynolds said that the associate degree appeals strongly to the parents of students headed to culinary school straight from high school because it offers general education as well as vocational training . Graduates who decide that baking is n't for them then have a foundation they can apply toward a bachelor 's degree in any discipline . <p> And baking is n't for everyone . Reynolds said a surprising number of people invest time and money in culinary courses without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to have total attention to detail , " said John Montanile , chairman of baking and patisserie at The Cooking and Hospitality Institute of Chicago . " You have to be very passionate about it . " <p> Leah A. Zeldes is local free-lance writer . <p> MAKE SURE YOU CAN TAKE THE HEAT <p> If you have an interest in pursuing a sweet career , educational paths as well as occupational opportunities abound . What 's best for you depends on your goals , temperament and wallet . Before signing up for a culinary course , professionals and educators advise : <p> - Assess yourself . Baking and pastry arts both require lots of patience , extreme precision and painstaking attention to detail . If you 're intolerant of repetitious tasks and easy-going about specifics , this may not be the career for you . In addition , all culinary careers require stamina . <p> - Assess your goals . Do you dream of wedding cakes covered with icing flowers and stacks of delicate petit fours or are you the dough-pounding , bread-baking type ? Different schools may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open your own bakery ? You may want a program that includes business classes . Do you already have a college degree ? You probably want to skip degree programs that require general education courses . But if you do n't have a degree , you may want college credits , particularly if you plan to rise to managerial roles . <p> - Get experience . Consider working in the industry before going to school . Time spent in a bakery or restaurant job can help you decide if this is the career for you . Even if you ca n't take on a full-time job , some bakers and chefs are willing to show wannabes the ropes in exchange for labor . <p> - Visit the schools . Personal visits to talk with instructors and check out the environment can help you decide which school will most suit you . Look into class sizes , facilities , extracurricular activities , career placement programs , financial aid packages . How much time do students spend in lectures vs. hands-on activities ?
