Somewhere north of Daytona Beach , mangrove gave way to mallow along the banks of the ICW and we saw the beginnings of the great spartina marshes that stretch northward into Georgia and the Carolinas . It was the second day of our journey from Ft . Lauderdale to Wilmington , N.C , to deliver the new Cruisers 385 Motor Yacht to the facility where it will be made . So far , it had been enjoyable . Our concern  --  Jon Wilman 's and mine  --  was the wind . It was blowing a stiff 25 knots out of the west with gusts to 45 . This had an immediate consequence . The wind had pushed the tidal waters out to sea and kept them there . Ergo , it was very shallow in The Ditch . It was also cold . As a prototype , this boat had no weather protection on the bridge  --  a Bimini top with full isinglass enclosure is in the offing  --  so Jon and I were bundled up like two big kids in snowsuits . Our trip did n't start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 66 Marina the morning before wearing shorts and T-shirts . It was so calm that we ran outside , bombing along at 28 mph . We made the transit from Lauderdale to Ponce de Leon Inlet north of Cape Canaveral , some 220 miles , in nine hours and 30 minutes . Going around the cape was a new experience for me . I 'd always gone up the inside . The government , of course , owns the entire cape , and the Kennedy Space Center sprawls over all of it . The giant assembly building and the launch pads and gantries look like creatures from a George Lucas epic , lumbering desert beasts set amidst saw palmetto and dunes . The old Canaveral Light is dwarfed by them . After we negotiated the tricky channel coming into the Lighthouse Marina at Ponce , we tied up in the shadow of the lovely old Ponce de Leon Inlet light station . We ate ashore at the Lighthouse Restaurant , sitting on decking tucked around twisted live oaks , remnants of an ancient maritime forest . The Cruisers 385 is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the 455 . The builder designed this model for maximum accommodation and good performance with gas power , although diesel is available , too . It 's for the yachtsman who wants to get to the best anchorage first , while taking along a small condominium . Our first night aboard was a revelation as to just how much roomy accommodation you can pack into 38 feet . The boat has two staterooms and two heads . Jon insisted I take the master stateroom aft , which had a pedestal berth with stowage under and a hanging locker , plus more closet and drawer space . This could be the only real walkaround queen berth on a boat of this size . The head was very spacious , and the shower had better water pressure than the one at my house . Jon took the forward stateroom with its double berth to port and a single berth on the opposite bulkhead . The head , which serves as a day facility , is as commodious as the master 's . In between the staterooms are a U-shaped galley and dinette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to port , opposite a sofa in the salon . A large , flat-screen TV is mounted over the dinette . The bridge , where we spent most of every day , is big enough for a small cocktail party , but it needs some rethinking . To wit : The helm and its two-person seat is to starboard ; a long settee is to port . If you 're the passenger , there 's only one place to sit ( unless you 're really cozy with the helmsman ) to face forward while under way , but it 's at the far end of the settee . I like to see where I 'm going when the boat is moving . Abaft the bridge is a nice cockpit with room for a couple of chairs and a table . It has a hardtop and wing doors port and starboard . The sidedecks are too narrow for most feet , but the trade-off is more livable space in the cabin  --  the builder bumped the salon bulkheads out . There is a spiral stair down to the swim platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasts a plan you can live with in considerable comfort , as we did for a week . The downside to all of the headroom and such is a high exterior profile and top hamper . Case in point : The next morning began with rain lashing the picture window in my stateroom and the palmettos and oaks bending with the westerlies . Getting off the dock took three of us and 20 minutes because the boat wanted to blow quickly across the tight dock space and into other vessels . The bowthruster did help . We made a pit stop in St. Augustine and then pushed up into the Tolomato River and the Palm Valley Cut behind Ponte Vedra Beach  --  the first of many endless no-wake zones . On this day , it was made more difficult by an extreme low tide ( the wind again ) . Docks here normally are knee-deep in water . They were now totally stranded , 20 feet or more from the water 's edge . We came upon a 40-foot sailboat hard aground in the middle of the channel , the skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had less than two feet under our hull as we scootched around him . We had intended to make St. Simons Island , Ga. , but the twilight forced us into the Amelia Island Marina for the night . The next morning found the Georgia sounds gentle and agreeable . I 'd never seen them this calm . Jon 's original itinerary planned on Charleston as our next stop , but we were behind schedule . Instead , we pulled into the Downtown Marina in Beaufort , S.C . This was more than fine with me . Beaufort is my hometown . We had a delightful dinner at a new-ish restaurant , Saltus , and were joined for coffee by my old friend Howard Farmer . I have often said that my heart is where my wife Robyn is , but my soul is in the Lowcountry . We had a very pleasant trip up to the Charleston area , passing through the lush , fecund marshes of Beaufort and Charleston counties . I took great delight in pointing out things of interest , including the colonial period house I grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fuel at the Isle of Palms Marina so we could continue without stopping to Myrtle Beach . But by the time we entered the Waccamaw River channel north of Georgetown , it was obvious we were n't going to make Myrtle Beach either , a notion reinforced by the no-wake in the cut below Socastee . ( Excuse me , but boats were here long before 99 percent of these houses ; there ought to be a law . ) So , we pulled into the tiny Hague Marina in Socastee instead . The owner gave us the keys to a courtesy car and directed us to a small Italian restaurant , Rossini 's , out on Highway 17 . We envisioned spaghetti and meatballs and thin , acidic Chianti . What we found was a delightful family eatery serving the best piece of fresh grouper I 've had in years . The throttles got a good workout for the rest of the journey as we passed through no-wake zones and slowed for the snowbirds . The weather remained sunny but cool , and the westerlies gave us a smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its usual snarling self . When we rounded into the Cape Fear River at South-port , N.C. , we hit the only bumpy stretch of water on the entire trip . A friend of mine once dourly remarked that voyages were fine as long as the liquor held out . It is probably a testament to Jon 's patience and good humor that we ended a week 's cruise just as good friends as when we 'd started . It is also a testament to the livability of a very accommodating , soothing cruising yacht . Illustration <p>
