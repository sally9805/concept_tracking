Most people who develop Lyme Disease , a tick-borne infection that 's endemic in parts of the Northeast and Midwest , are easily cured by taking an antibiotic like doxycycline for a couple of weeks . But for years a debate has raged over what to do about patients whose symptoms ( fatigue , mental confusion , joint pain ) never seem to clear up . One small but vocal group of doctors and patient advocates believes that Lyme 's corkscrew-shaped spirochetes have burrowed deep into their victims ' bodies and can be eradicated only with intensive antibiotic treatment over many months . Another group believes , just as adamantly , that the bacteria are long gone , making further treatment with powerful antibiotics  --  which can lead to potentially fatal infections or blood clots  --  positively dangerous . <P> Now comes word of two studies in the New England Journal of Medicine that show that long-term antibiotic treatment is no better than a placebo for folks with chronic Lyme disease . Originally scheduled for publication in July , the research is part of a group of findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak Lyme months of June and July . If confirmed by another major study that 's looking at chronic Lyme and antibiotics from a slightly different perspective , the results would seem to settle the question once and for all . <P> Researchers from Boston , New Haven , Conn. , and Valhalla , N.Y. , followed 129 patients who had previously been treated for well-documented cases of Lyme disease . Sixty-four were given antibiotics directly into their veins for a month , followed by two months of oral antibiotics . The others received dummy medications . A third of the chronic Lyme patients got better while taking the antibiotics , but so did a third of those on the placebo . Indeed , the results were so similar that a monitoring board decided to cut the trials short rather than add more subjects to the test groups . <P> Unfortunately , the debate over chronic Lyme has become so heated that no one expects the controversy to go away . But both sides may take comfort in the other findings that were released by the New England Journal last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of New York with a lot of Lyme disease , researchers concluded that a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline dramatically cut the risk of contracting the disease . That good news is tempered somewhat by the fact that 80% of patients who develop the infection do n't remember ever being bitten by a tick . ( The bugs inject an anesthetic into the skin to mask the pain and in their nymph stage are so small  --  about the size of a poppy seed  --  that they are easily overlooked . ) <P> There 's still plenty you can do to protect yourself in a Lyme-infested neighborhood : tuck your pants in your socks , spray DEET on your clothing , check yourself and your kids for ticks . And if you develop a spreading red rash  --  particularly if it 's accompanied by joint pain , chills or confusion  --  make sure you see a doctor right away . The trick , as always , is to be vigilant without overreacting . <P>  --  By Christine Gorman            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
