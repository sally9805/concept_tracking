<p> How sweet that they converge again , on a course originally designed for the ladies , in a pairing that suggests part fantasy , part prizefight and part Celebrity Deathmatch claymation chaos . The only problem with our fine fortune is that Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson still are n't dueling as equals in the PGA Championship . In a sport defined by majors , recent developments have left the scoreboard in a White Sox vs . Cubs mode . <p> Tiger 11 , Phil 3 . <p> So really now , is n't a Thursday morning drama in the western suburbs more about an inevitable pecking order being reaffirmed atop the golfing hierarchy ? In a matter of weeks , Woods renewed himself as the Jack-stalker and king of his sport , thrashing through the grief and tears of his father 's death to dominate the British Open and later claim his 50th victory on the PGA Tour . This while Mickelson , poised to pounce on Tiger like never before , played the 18th hole at the U.S. Open like the old Michael Jordan-Larry Bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bunker , past the green ... nothing but choke . On the cusp of legendhood , Phil lapsed into his old heartbreaker role and self-sabotaged his best chance to challenge Woods ' dominance . <p> We 've always hoped , prayed and rubbed our club heads together that someday , with each man in his optimum prime , they 'd battle on even terms in a lengthy rivalry . And maybe some semblance of such competition is still ahead . But there is no denying where they stand in what will be recalled as a crossroads summer of 2006 . Barring a kidnapping or chronic back injury , Woods steadily will stalk and break Jack Nicklaus ' record of 18 major titles , which will end all debates about who 's the greatest ever . As someone who was quick to label Tiger 's stumbles a few years back as " a slump , " I now can say he has passed through enough life and career experiences  --  swing changes , the loss of Earl Woods , holy matrimony , temper tantrums , dealing with the intense global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has changed his sport as much as Jordan changed his or Babe Ruth changed his , and when asked Tuesday if he might go down among the all-time athletic giants , he did n't dismiss the concept . <p> Tiger appreciating the moment <p> " That 's a step in the right direction  --  we 're looking at golfers as athletes , " Woods said in the Medinah media tent . " I think if you 're in that conversation , you 've been very fortunate and had a great career . Hopefully , I can continue doing what I 'm doing so I can be part of that discussion . " <p> He also sounded like a man who finally realizes he is winning the war , mostly against himself . Tiger knows what he has become : the biggest sportsman on the planet . Now it 's time to finish what he started and enjoy the process . " It 's a dream come true , " he said , smiling . " I did n't think in my wildest dreams I could actually achieve what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could win this many times in my first 10 years . " At last , he is allowing himself to breathe in , breathe out and appreciate Being Tiger . <p> Mickelson ? He 'll forever be known as the unlucky S.O.B . who happened to be born in the same era as Tiger . You wo n't hear this being seconded by Mickelson 's short-game guru , Dave Pelz , who briefly interrupted an otherwise peaceful practice-round mood by telling the Chicago Tribune , " When Phil 's at his best , I 'm thinking nobody can beat him . " That would include Woods , Pelz emphasized , which might qualify as the most ill-timed piece of trash talk in recent sports history . Basically , he is trying to glorify his student 's underachievement , leaving Mickelson to employ sheepish damage control . <p> " My man , he 's enthusiastic , " he said . " I have tried to not give you too much to run with , and so I 'm paying other people now to do it . " <p> Said Woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm pretty tough to beat when I 'm playing well , too . " <p> The comments  --  Pelz 's Bells , we 'll call them  --  only will trigger the long-festering perception that Woods and Mickelson ca n't stand each other . Maturity has quelled some old tensions that hinted they were enemies more than rivals , as revealed four years ago when Tour pro Mark Calcavecchia told Golf Digest , " Not everyone can get along with everybody else . They put up with each other , but they are n't the best of friends ... I think some of the things Phil says might rub Tiger a little the wrong way  --  Tiger might think he 's a know-it-all and cocky . " Then came their standoff at the Ryder Cup , which was noted Tuesday by U.S. Open champion Geoff Ogilvy , the Aussie who will be the obscure mate in the threesome . <p> " It 'll be interesting to see how they get along with each other , " Ogilvy said . <p> Rivalry ' a good story ' <p> And what does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it started , but that Ryder Cup pairing a few years ago  --  or was it the last Ryder Cup ? " he said . " That probably set it more in motion than it was . They did n't appear to be best friends that day , I do n't know . They walked on the first tee and they were on both sides of the tee . I do n't know ; they do n't play practice rounds together . They 're the two best golfers in the world , and you guys want a story , and that 's a bit of a story . " <p> Either Ogilvy is a reckless gossip monger or he knows something we do n't . <p> Only once have the two goliaths been paired together in a major , in the final round of a 2001 Masters won by Woods . While much will be made of their grouping in the first and second rounds  --  are there enough police in DuPage County to handle the swelled , crazed galleries ?  --  the story line is bittersweet because it reflects what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be a common event , not a rarity , and it 's no surprise Woods is ho-humming the significance while acknowledging he wo n't be chatting much with Mickelson , not that he chats with anyone while playing . <p> " You 're out there just handling your own business , " he said . " Obviously , I get along with some players better than others , and that 's just the way it is . Sometimes I talk , sometimes I do n't . Sometimes I 'm in the mood to talk , sometimes I 'm not going to say a word even if my best friend is out there . You 're there to win a tournament . We can always go out for a beer later . " <p> It would be nice , as Mickelson said , if their prepackaged pairing extended to the weekend and did n't die on the leaderboard . That way , we truly could celebrate the champion of the world and his leading challenger . For now , this is n't a showdown as much as a happenstance meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I love the chance to compete against such a great competitor . He 's one of the best players of all time , if not the best , " Mickelson said . " It 's been a fun challenge for me and the other guys to play against him , and he 's pushed me to work harder and get better and achieve levels of success I may not have achieved had he not been there pushing me .
