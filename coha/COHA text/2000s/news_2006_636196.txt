<p> GET ' EM WHEN WE CAN <p> The damning evidence was on the front page of Wednesday 's Post : A dramatic photo showing more than 100 Taliban terrorists in formation last July for a graveside funeral for one of their own in Afghanistan . <p> The image was shot from high in the sky by an unmanned American drone  --  which sent a continuous satellite feed back to the ground . <p> A ripe target for a surprise missile strike ? It certainly would seem so . <p> But according to a statement yesterday from U.S. Central Command in Afghanistan , " a decision was made "  --  preposterously  --  " not to strike the group of insurgents at that specific location and time " because the site was a cemetery with a funeral in progress . <p> In the end , all intelligence officials could do was to watch helplessly as the terrorists split up into groups too small to be targeted with any precision . <p> The Pentagon said that it does not discuss rules of engagement . <p> No wonder . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Taliban , as savage a foe as American troops have ever encountered , follow no rules at all . A failure to fire on an assemblage of that size , simply to protect the cultural sensitivities of a cold-blooded foe , borders on the insane . <p> Editorial , New York Post <p> CA N'T WIN WITH DEMS <p> Imagine that George W. Bush had remained focused like a laser beam on the war in Afghanistan . <p> Not content with toppling the Taliban , he sent 130,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan in a determined effort to kill or capture every single member of al-Qaida . <p> He accomplished much , but Osama bin Laden remained in hiding , somewhere in the world 's most inhospitable territory in Afghanistan or Pakistan . Meanwhile , resentment against the American presence built . <p> An insurgency rose up , using improvised explosive devices and suicide bombers to kill U.S. soldiers . The American death toll mounted . <p> Now , do you believe that , if that had happened , Democrats would still be supporting the president 's policy in Afghanistan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others would not be accusing George W. Bush of pursuing a misguided strategy in the war on terror , charging that the president was so obsessed with tracking down every last terrorist in Afghanistan that he ignored threats from places like Iran , North Korea , and  --  yes  --  Saddam Hussein 's Iraq ? <p> Do you believe that Democrats today , seven weeks before Election Day , would be united behind the president ? <p> I did n't think so . <p> Byron York , the Hill <p> WHERE ARE ' MODERATE ' STINGRAYS ? <p> As regular readers of The Nose on Your Face know , I have been atypically slow to react to the untimely and tragic death of Steve " The Crocodile Hunter " Irwin . I have been waiting to see what the reaction would be from the stingray community on this violent and cowardly act but as of yet I have heard nothing . Nada . Zilch . <p> Where are all of the " moderate " stingrays that I keep hearing about in the press ? Just one stingray speaking out against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal stingray apologists who have taken up their cause . <p> I keep hearing marine biologists and other oceanic experts repeat the same talking points over and over : " It is extremely rare for stingrays to kill people , " " Stingrays just want to live in peace , " " Most stingrays disagree with what happened . " <p> Balderdash . I have heard of exactly one encounter between a stingray and a human , a well-trained and very experienced wild animal expert at that , which literally ended in cold-blooded murder . I am no mathematician , but that is almost a 90 percent kill ratio for these swift-swimming agents of death . <p> So today I issue a challenge to the " moderate " stingray community if they exist : Stand up ( or hop out of the water or whatever it is that you do ) and speak out against this terrible hate crime or face being lumped in with the rest of your murderous breed . <p> Buckley F. Williams , <p> The Nose On Your Face <p> A LITTLE LATE KICKING BUTT <p> John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a viable presidential candidate , boasts to the Washington Examiner that if anyone tries to " swift boat " him in the ' 08 campaign , he 's " prepared to kick their ass from one end of America to the other . " OK . So why did n't he kick ass in 2004 ? Well , according to Kerry , it 's because he did n't have the cash . <p> The Examiner article reports : " Kerry says the only reason he did n't compete in more states in 2004 was that he ran out of money . He says this was also the reason he did not adequately respond to a series of devastating TV ads by Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth , a group that questioned Kerry 's service in Vietnam and criticized his later opposition to the war . " <p> But did n't Kerry finish the presidential campaign with $16 million in his campaign treasury ? Lack of funds was n't Kerry 's problem in 2004 ; his problem was lack of will . <p> Jason Zengerle , <p> New Republic <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for handling and trying accused terrorists , the Senate confronts a fateful choice : Will it send President Bush , as he demands , legislation that would authorize the CIA to engage in interrogation tactics the world understands as torture , rewrite America 's obligations under the Geneva Conventions and authorize trials whose fairness many people at home and abroad will question ? Or will the Senate approve a bill that ensures justice for foreign detainees and ends the CIA 's secret detentions and harsh interrogations ? <p> The administration is seeking a bill that would define Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions in such a way as to permit the CIA to continue abusive practices that in the past have included induced hypothermia and " waterboarding , " or simulated drowning . The administration bill would also authorize commission trials in which the defendant , under certain circumstances , might not see evidence on which his life may depend and could be convicted by statements extracted in highly coercive interrogations . <p> It is essential that this not pass . For Congress to " interpret " the Geneva Conventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbid would be to invite other countries to do the same  --  to American troops . To authorize trials that needlessly depart from international norms will only invite skepticism about the convictions they deliver , further degrade the United States in the eyes of the world and make martyrs of those condemned to prison or death . Cooperation with allies , vital to stopping future terrorist attacks , will be seriously impeded . <p> Editorial , Washington Post <p> WAR CRIME IS A WAR CRIME <p> " We do not deny that we have bombarded Israeli cities , settlements and infrastructure . But this was always a reaction . It was a natural reaction . When a state is invaded , it must defend itself . " <p> Hezbollah leader Hassan Fadlallah , defending attacks on Israeli civilians <p> " Targeting civilians is a war crime . There 's no gray area . " <p> U.S. Amnesty International Executive Director Larry Cox <p> english.aljazeera.net <p> TAKE AWAY WOMEN 'S SHOES <p> A bill introduced in the Ohio State House would not only ban abortion , but make it illegal for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion . Let me restate : Ohio wants to make it a crime for an adult woman to go to another state to have a legal medical procedure . I think the legislator involved , Ohio Rep. Tom Brinkman , should go even further . Why stop at allowing women to travel freely across state lines to obtain legal procedures ? Why not outlaw selling adult women shoes ? <p> Rachel Joy Larris , TomPaine.com <p> CONSPIRACY THEORY OUT OF GAS <p> It 's already started . With gas prices now down 90 cents a gallon from previous highs , allegations are now being made that President Bush is manipulating the prices to come down just before the fall elections . If only that were true . But sadly for the Dems , the truth is the market is driving the prices down . If it were true that Bush can control the gas prices with such ease , why in the world were gas prices skyrocketing in 2004 through the entire election cycle ? If he had the ability to affect gas prices , that would have been the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than $1.50 to more than $2 a gallon right into November . So please spare me the conspiracy theories on the gas prices . <p> OvertheKohls blog , <p> Townhall.com <p> Editor 's note : All items have been edited for space . Photo : Get ' em when we can
