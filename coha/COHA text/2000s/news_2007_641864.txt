<p> Tony Schumacher just might be the best-kept secret in Chicago sports . In his world , he 's huge . Sort of comes with the territory when you win the championship four years in a row , the last two at the last possible moment . <p> But Schumacher is a drag racer , which means that even though he is a Chicago guy  --  born in the area , raised here , lives here  --  his accomplishments hardly rate more than a paragraph or two in the Auto Racing Roundup , even in his hometown . <p> Last Sunday , on the storied stretch of pavement in Pomona , Calif. , where drag racing was born , Schumacher leapfrogged from fourth to first in the final event of the National Hot Rod Association season to capture the top-fuel points title for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year ( his fifth overall ) . The only way for him to four-peat ( something a certain legendary Bull never did ) under the NHRA 's new " Countdown to 1 " system was for the points leader coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first round of eliminations and for Schumacher to win the event . Just as he did the year before , Schumacher , 37 , did not clinch the title until the win light lit for his lane on the final pass of the season . Talk about clutch . <p> The Sun-Times ' resident drag-racing aficionado caught up with Schumacher a few days after the celebrations were over as he was driving to a Chipotle restaurant , two of his kids in the back seat . <p> Question : Chipotle , huh ? <p> Answer : Yeah , when I did the ESPYs last year , they gave us a free year 's supply of Chipotle . We love it . Either me or my wife gets it just about every day . <p> Q : In titles won and with your flair for the dramatic , your accomplishments could be considered Jordanesque . Considering it 's your hometown and that there 's a series stop in Joliet , is it kind of a drag that Tony Schumacher does n't rate a bigger blip on Chicago sports radar ? <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such a fantastic sport . Even the " stick and ball " people , once they get dragged out to an event , they 're hooked . <p> I 'm proud to live in a town that loves its sports as Chicago does . So be it that not so many people in this area follow drag racing . But it 's a nationwide sport and worldwide sport , which is huge . There are so many pro sports teams in Chicago , it 's understandable that coverage for drag racing is going to be a little light . <p> Bottom line is I love what I do . I would drive a race car with nobody watching , for not a nickel . <p> Q : The way you won the points championship this year  --  with all the dominoes falling in place at Pomona  --  does that make you the biggest fan of new playoff-type points system ? <p> A : When I heard last year that NHRA was going to it , I was n't too thrilled . Because our team in top fuel and John Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we had won 10 and 12 races in a couple of seasons  --  that 's why it came up . <p> Clearly , the system was put in to put us at a disadvantage . This allowed other teams to have a chance . But we said rules are rules . It was up to us to figure out what was necessary to win . Crew chief Alan Johnson said the way to go was to win a couple of races here , a couple there . In reality , all we did was go out and test and test and prepare for the last couple of races . Even when we were struggling a bit , the team stuck together . All that testing put us in a position to win . <p> Q : On that last day at Pomona , Hot Rod goes out in the first round to open the door for you , and you beat Brandon Bernstein in the semis in the matchup that set the table . Then it gets dark and the track temperature drops . Everybody figures you are a lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheelhouse . The final against Bob Vandergriff is no contest , and you win the points title on your dad 's birthday . How big of a gas was that ? <p> A : The way it played out , everything had to be perfect . I was joking in the morning with my dad team owner Don Schumacher when he was setting up for the year-end party . I told him , ' It does n't look like you 're planning on a very big party . ' I went to church that morning and had prayed for a miracle and told him that when you pray for a miracle , you expect it to happen . You know , just joking . <p> And then you go out and do it ... for the second year in a row . Hot Rod spins his tires in the first round . Alan and I just looked at each other and it was like deja vu ... here we go again ! <p> I saw the win light go off in the final , and my mind flashed to who am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit me that I had to thank God and my dad . My dad has done so much for my career , building this team , making this all possible . Kids these days do n't say thank you enough to their dads . <p> Q : A motorsports mantra is that these cars burn money , not fuel . The U.S. Army has been your main sponsor for many years . How important , really , are the sponsors ? <p> A : Most of our sponsors have been with me so long , they 're like family . We 're not hurting for car parts , but we 're not the biggest-budget team , either . Bernstein 's got Budweiser as his primary backer , and his budget doubles ours . <p> You can not believe how inspiring it is to be on board with the Army . I 've been with the generals in Iraq , the special-ops guys who rescued Jessica Lynch . Not to sound corny , but it really is a band of brothers-type thing . Soldiers have given me their Army rings , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 've got a zillion people all over the world pulling for me when I run . All Brandon 's got is a bunch of beer drinkers ( laughing ) . <p> Q : There have been two recent deaths in drag racing  --  Darrell Russell and Eric Medlin . Nothing else in motorsports makes 6,000 horsepower and routinely goes faster than 300 mph like a nitro-powered dragster or funny car . You 've had a couple of horrific crashes . Is fear ever an issue ? <p> A : Risk is part of the equation . Our whole deal is about testing the limits , expanding the envelope , getting quicker , going faster . We make changes to the cars to get them to go faster , we break a car in half and we fix it . So we make more changes , break another car in half and fix it . <p> Here 's something for your stick and ball guys : Would you all show up it it was flag football ? ' Hey , it 's the Pats and Colts , Monday Night FLAG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . <p> THE LIST <p> hawkey talk <p> Rocky Wirtz has made cosmetic improvements to the Blackhawks , but hopefully he 's not done . Here are a few others public-relations moves we 'd like to see him make : <p> Cut ticket prices <p> What better way to apologize to the fans who have had to watch some lousy hockey in recent years than to give them a break . The White Sox offer discounts on certain days . The Hawks should try it . And maybe $1 hot-dog night . <p> Bring back Foley <p> The fan base Wirtz wants to regain associates Pat Foley 's voice with Blackhawks success . Get him back . <p> Roar with the Wolves <p> If there 's a way , associate yourselves with the Wolves . The Wolves are a very successful organization . Do n't split the hockey fan base of the city . Combine the two . It would seem to make smart business sense . <p> HITS <p> Derrick Rose <p> He still looks like he 's playing against high school competition . One year at Memphis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft next year . <p> Rocky Wirtz <p> There 's a new sheriff in town , and there 's no doubt he 's going to make a difference . The TV deal and shelving Bob Pulford were <p> decent starts , but a playoff berth is a must . <p> Boston fans <p> As if the city does n't have enough to celebrate with the Red Sox , Patriots , Celtics and Boston College , the Revolution has to <p> bicycle-kick the Fire out of the MLS playoffs . <p> MISSES <p> Bears <p> Even during a bye week , they lost ground in the standings , They also lost an accomplished veteran in guard Ruben Brown . He 'll miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder surgery . <p> New York City Marathon <p> The timing strip at the beginning was broken , so about one-third of the runners had to try to calculate their times . It has n't been a good year for marathoners  --  and not just in Chicago . <p> Ben Wallace <p> Hopefully your sore ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing to promote the brand you 're selling .
