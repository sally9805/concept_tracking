For more than a decade , she 's been at the top in a lucrative business that can be shallow , cutthroat and prone to excesses of ego and behavior . <p> But friends from the modest Florida neighborhood where supermodel Niki Taylor grew up  --  and where her parents still live  --  say Taylor is nothing but super nice . They are praying she will recover from the injuries she received in a recent car accident in Atlanta . <p> " She 's very simple and , believe it or not , very shy , " said Rosie Esquivel , who lives across the street from the home in Pembroke Pines where Taylor 's family has lived for longer than most neighbors can remember . " You might think , ' Oh , she 's a supermodel , I ca n't talk to her , ' but she 's down-to-earth .

" She ca n't talk because she 's on a respirator , but she 's able to point to a signboard to communicate with the family . She told them she wants to go home . " <p> A celebrity at 14 , Niki Taylor has a life story that reads something like a modern-day fairy tale : the unassuming beauty from an average , middle-class family who overnight wins fame , fortune and head-spinning success . <p> But the script includes tragedy , too  --  the surprise death of her younger sister , Krissy , also a model with a blossoming career , who died suddenly at 17 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . <p> Taylor was injured in a car accident early on the morning of April 29 while she was in Atlanta visiting old friends , Eaton said .

While the town sports gated communities with huge , showcase homes , Taylor 's parents have remained in their modest neighborhood of well-kept but older houses . Most appear to have two or three bedrooms and one-car garages . <p> " They thought about moving after Niki got successful , but I think they did n't want people treating them like they were famous , " Esquivel said . <p> " They 're just very nice people , " Blanscet said .

Although she was never diagnosed with asthma , the medical examiner ruled that Krissy died from complications brought on by an asthma attack .
