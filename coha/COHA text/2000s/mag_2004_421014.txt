Section : HEALTHY PET Help your dog eat to live , not live to eat <p> Sporty , Baby , Bertha , Gracie , and 44 other Labrador retrievers may hold the secret to helping your dog live a longer , healthier life . <p> In the first lifelong canine diet-restriction study , researchers discovered that Labrador retrievers fed 25% less food than their siblings in a control group had a median life span of nearly 2 years longer . The conclusion among participating scientists : less food in the bowl adds more  --  and healthier  --  years to dogs ' lives . <p> Researchers at the Purina Pet Institute in St. Louis , in collaboration with scientists from several major universities , published results of this 14-year study that shows that a dog 's median life span can potentially be extended by 15% when the dog is kept to its ideal body condition by carefully monitoring food intake . <p> " We all know that obesity , whether human or canine , is bad for health , " says Dennis F. Lawler , DVM , a veterinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , PhD , directed the Purina Lifespan study . " What 's exciting about this study is that , for the first time , we have shown scientifically that by simply feeding to maintain the ideal body condition throughout a dog 's life , we can increase length of life while delaying the visible signs of aging . That 's powerful stuff . " Lean-Feeding Cuisine <p> The study began in 1987 at Purina 's pet care center with 48 Labrador retriever puppies from seven litters . " We selected Labs because their life span averages between 12 and 15 years , a medium age span between the small breeds who tend to live longer and the large breeds who tend to live fewer years , " says Dr. Lawler . " Also , Labradors are chowhounds and prone to obesity , which made this breed a good candidate for our study . " <p> Dogs in each litter were paired at 8 weeks of age based on gender and body weights . Throughout their lives , the daily care and feeding were managed identically for all 48 dogs .

All dogs were given regular health evaluations to check body fat mass , lean body mass , bone density , and glucose and insulin use , as well as cholesterol and triglyceride levels and many other health parameters . <p> The only difference : food quantity . One dog in each pair was fed 25% less food per day than its mate . <p> The study , which was published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association ( May 1 , 2002 , vol 220 , no 9 ) , revealed the following results . <p> &gt; Dogs who ate 25% fewer calories than their littermates maintained a lean or ideal body condition , resulting in a median life span that was 15% ( or nearly 2 years ) longer than the dogs who ate more food . <p> &gt; By age 10 , seven dogs in the control group had died , compared with only three lean-fed dogs . <p> &gt; By age 13 , only one control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> &gt; By age 13.5 years , no dogs in the control group were alive , but 25% of the lean-fed dogs had survived . <p> &gt; The lean-fed dogs did not require treatment for osteoarthritis until a median age of 13.3 years , fully 3 years later than the dogs in the control group . <p> These results are significant because this represents the first lifelong study controlling food intake in a large-size mammal , says Richard Weindruch , PhD , a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of medicine and expert in the diet restriction field . <p> " It is clear that there are a number of health problems frequently associated with overeating and obesity  --  both in dogs and in people , " explains Dr. Weindruch . " From this study , we can extrapolate that large mammals , including humans , can potentially live healthier and longer lives through reasonable diet restriction . " Food Bowl Tips <p> Keep your dog fit and healthy by following these tips . <p> &gt; Ask your veterinarian if your dog 's body condition is ideal . If not , work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return him to that goal condition . <p> &gt; Read the food label for recommended daily portions based on your dog 's weight , and look at the package back for an illustration of a dog at ideal body condition to see if your dog matches up . It 's more important to feed your dog to his ideal body condition than to a certain weight . <p> &gt; Feed the dog , not the bowl . Use a measuring cup when scooping the dry food into the food bowl so you know exactly how much you are serving . Get a smaller bowl if you think it looks too empty . <p> &gt; Perform a weekly check on your dog to make sure you can easily feel his ribs . Examine his profile to see if his abdomen is tucked behind the rib cage , and stand over him to see if he has a clearly defined waist behind the ribs . <p> &gt; Adjust the amount you serve your dog to maintain ideal body condition .

Walk This Way <p> Team up sound nutrition with regular fitness to keep your aging dog in shape . M. Christine Zink , DVM , PhD , an expert in canine sports medicine , recommends that you follow these steps to maximize the health benefits of walking your dog . <p> &gt; Warm up your dog 's muscles by starting with a 5-minute slow pace . Then take a 10- to 15-minute brisk walk , ending with a 5-minute slow pace to cool down the muscles . <p> &gt; Keep your dog on a brisk pace for the majority of the walk so that he trots rather than saunters . This gait exercises both sides of your dog 's body and provides him with a cardiovascular workout . <p> &gt; Aim for 20-minute daily walks rather than hour-long walks on weekends . A little exercise every day is better than a lot of exercise once or twice a week . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Encourage his appetite for exercise . <p> PHOTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still love you-and for longer . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : OBESE <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : OVERWEIGHT <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : IDEAL <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Arden Moore <p> <p> Pet expert Arden Moore is the award-winning author of The Kitten Owner 's Manual and Real Food for Dogs ( both Storey Books , 2001 ) and a graduate of The Humane Society of the United States 's " Pets for Life " national companion-animal training program . <p>
