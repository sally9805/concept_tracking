You probably have n't given much thought to the growing number of computer chips in popular gadgets like digital cameras , cell phones , DVD players and those portable devices used to play downloaded music . Why bother ? You do n't need the recipe to enjoy the soup . But anyone struggling to understand what has been a remarkable turn in orders for semiconductors and the high-tech equipment needed to make them should take note : products such as cars and medical devices  --  from pacemakers to hearing aids  --  are taking up a lot of the slack left after the telecom bust . APPLIED DIGITAL SOLUTIONS ' new VeriChip , for example , is injected under your skin and when scanned  --  say , in the emergency room  --  gives doctors a complete medical history . The semiconductor recovery wo n't be complete without renewed demand from traditional users such as CISCO and NORTEL . But if they kick in later this year , it could be a great time for the industry . <P> Already , chip-equipment and chipmaker stocks have taken wing . Shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 market bottom , while shares of APPLIED MATERIALS , the world 's biggest maker of equipment used to manufacture chips , are up 76%  --  twice as much as the NASDAQ composite . Behind the surge has been a string of reports that chip inventories have been pared , and new orders are flooding in . From November through January , orders grew at an annualized rate double that of the same period a year earlier . <P> The demand has come mostly from manufacturers of PCs , next-generation cell phones and consumer electronics , including ever more sophisticated game consoles such as Xbox and GameCube . But telecom companies have stepped up their pace too . " Later in the year , we could see a real surprise , " says analyst Chris Chaney at A.G. EDWARDS . " Someone like Intel could come in with a big order for new equipment . " Chaney favors the equipment makers , which he views as better values than the chipmakers . The equipment companies ' shares also tend to be earlier movers , because chipmakers must buy more equipment before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in so many products , new orders for them and for the equipment needed to make them faster and smaller serve as a leading indicator for the economy . A surge suggests that many manufacturers are ramping up . One risk : these stocks could drop 50% in a blink if the recovery is weak or delayed . And that 's no long shot . Key clients like LUCENT remain financially strapped . <P> Meanwhile , the lift-off thus far has been more projected than real . " We 've seen stabilization , but the end market has n't recovered , " notes analyst Jeremy Lopez at MORNINGSTAR . At Applied Materials , revenue will be down 40% this year , and the firm will earn just 25cents a share , Chaney estimates , compared with $2.39 in the peak year of 2000 . It will be two to three years before earnings per share top the previous peak , he says . And you should n't own the stock unless you believe that will happen .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
