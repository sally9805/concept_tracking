Prologue London , 1491 Traitors ! " shrieked an old crone from the midst of a large crowd swarming around the base of the crude platform in the Smithfield marketplace . Her voice joined the cacophony of cries of those selling pies , ale and trinkets ; of neighbors hailing neighbors ; and here and there coarse , lewd laughter . Every now and again , an agonized scream emanated from the scaffold , followed by wild cheers from hundreds of leering faces . Acrid smoke hung like a stifling mantle over the square . Half hidden on a stone ledge behind an abutment , a widow shielded her eyes from the scene . " Is it finished , my son ? " she whispered to the young man next to her . The stench overpowered her - a sickening mix of burnt flesh , spilled blood , singed hair and hundreds of sweaty , unwashed bodies . It was like nothing she had ever smelled , and her stomach heaved . Her son , who was less squeamish , stood on tiptoe and stared in fascinated horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is one more nearing the scaffold . " He turned his head to look at her , his chestnut hair a mirror of what hers once had been , and saw her pain . " I should take you from this place , " he said with concern . " ' T is not seemly that you bear witness to such cruelty . Why arewe here ? " " How is the last one , Dickon ? Is he young ? Do they call his name ? " He did not have a chance to answer . " Death to the traitor ! Death to the traitorous bastard ! " shouted a man at the front of the crowd . " Why , ' t is Richard 's bastard . ' T is John of Gloucester . Why were we not told ? " a large man called to the captain in charge of the prisoners . The soldier shrugged and turned away . " A king 's son should have a private execution . ' T is customary , " the man grumbled . A moment of silence followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd were puzzled . They had no quarrel with John . They had come to witness the death of three men accused of treason . King Henry seemed bent on purging his kingdom of anyone he believed a threat to him . " What treason has John committed ? " asked another man . " And who saw the trial ? " Silence . " Too close to Richard for comfort , " yelled a woman near the widow , and many laughed , relieved to have the tension broken . But the onlookers were no longer concerned with past transgressions , only with present consequences . They had come to see three men dispatched by the most grisly method of execution : hanged until almost dead , taken down , their entrails ripped from them and burned , and finally hacked into quarters . The heads would be set upon London gate , a warning to all prospective traitors . That one of these condemned turned out to be royal - albeit a bastard - was all the more titillating . Out for blood , the crowd 's hush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surging forward , it met a wall of soldiers , who kept them from tearing the calm , dark-haired man to pieces before the hangman and disemboweler could do their work . The son of dead King Richard was given the last rites at the base of the scaffold , a few paces from the drawn and quartered remains of another so-called traitor to Henry , the new king . He mounted the stairs and was led forward on the platform to the last noose . The crowd pelted him with clods of earth , rotten vegetables and the occasional stone until the hangman held up his hand for it all to stop . John looked out on the expectant faces in front of him and acknowledged the hate in them . A mere eight years earlier , these same faces were smiling and cheering at him and the brightly colored cavalcade on its way to his father 's coronation . Now they stared at him , anticipating a cry for mercy or an admission of treachery . He was searching the crowd in vain for one friendly face when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low ledge , her hand tightly entwined with that of a young man with chestnut hair . Her hood had fallen back , revealing a sad face with tired eyes . The ugly masses melted into memories of long ago : a fire-lit solar where a voice like an angel lulled him with a song about knights , ladies and love ; tawny eyes anxiously watching him sweat out a childish fever in her luxurious tester bed ; warm arms holding his six-year-old body close on a summer day when the air was filled with farewells ; and more recently , a touch of her hand briefly through the prison grille when she had come for the last time . " Mother ! " The single word came as a groan , and shameless tears welled . The woman heard his cry and reached out her hand to him , not heeding the danger . He averted his eyes , afraid of implicating her . " He cries for his mother , the baby ! " shouted one of King Henry 's plants in the throng , eliciting more cruel guffaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to stare curiously at the woman in the black cloak . She instantly let her arm drop . It was as though she had heard a silent plea from the prisoner , and before the crowd 's interest became a threat , she got down from her ledge and , still clutching the young man 's hand , ran down an alley away from the smell , the jeers and those haunting gray-blue eyes . When she was away from the sight and sound of the scene , she stopped to take a breath , tears streaming down her face . Dickon stared at her . The errant wisps of hair around her widow 's wimple were white , and her forty-year-old face was lined with suffering . She who had looked after him now needed his care . His mother was growing old . " Mother , why are you so distressed ? Why did we have to attend ? " he asked again , taking her shoulders and giving them a gentle shake . She looked full into his eyes . " Because he is my son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But ... I do not understand . I am your son ! " His strong chin jutted forward , reminding her so much of his father that she choked . He took her arm . " The air has addled your wits . Come , sit down , and I will find you refreshment . " Dickon led her to a stone bench in deserted Cheapside . With no one to stop them , dogs roamed in and out of open doors , mangy cats ranged rubbish heaps looking for scraps , and a rat scuttled across the street . The sun glinted off the puddles of sewage all along the wide thoroughfare . There can be no greater grief than a mother 's , the woman thought , her head in her hands , remembering , too , the death of her daughter from the sweating sickness not six years since . And such a death as this ... Her sobs came harder . " Dear God , I pray you took him quickly ! " she called to the heavens , as Dickon stood by , perplexed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of her fingers and prayed that the missing ring had bought John death by strangulation from the hangman before the disemboweler did his work . Ah , Richard ! I hope with all my heart your precious gift has helped our son heavenward with little pain . Of all its uses , this must be the crown . After a while , the woman allowed herself to be led , as if in a trance , the short distance to where the Cheap Cross marked the entrance to the Mermaid Inn . Once through the courtyard and in the safety of their chamber , Dickon washed her face and hands and made her lie on the bed to rest . " Please try and sleep , Mother . I will be out in the courtyard if you need me . " " Nay , Dickon . I pray you , do not leave me ! " Her tone was urgent and her eyes implored him to stay . " There is much I must tell you , and now is a good time . I can not bear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . " She patted the bed and took his hand , already calloused from stoneworking . She held it to her cheek . " John of Gloucester is ... was my son . " She saw the disbelief in his look . " Aye , he was your brother . Bear with me , Dickon , and I will tell you all . " She tore her eyes from his troubled face and looked towards the window , not knowing where to start , her thoughts still with the scene at Smithfield . She knew she owed him the truth after all this time . Dickon stroked her hair , hating to see the tears that flowed unheeded down her cheeks . Why was he surprised ? His mother had suddenly come to claim him when he was thirteen , a little time after the new King Henry had taken the throne . Until then he had believed she was his aunt . She had never given him a satisfactory explanation for all their years apart , and it had taken him a long time to love and accept her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was almost afraid to know more . Thus they sat , mother and son , both lost in their own thoughts , as a bird 's fluting warble began in a tree in the central courtyard . The birdsong awoke something in her . He saw her eyes soften , her mouth curve into a smile as she whispered , " Listen , Dickon ! I can hear a blackbird . " ( Continues ... )
