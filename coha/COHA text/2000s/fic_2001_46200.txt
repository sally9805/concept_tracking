Since they left Houston that summer , Hugh and his mother had traveled in a long , slow circuit as far north as Amarillo , then worked their way down through El Paso and San Antonio and Austin , seeing sights Hugh had no desire to see , and in which he doubted his mother had any real interest , either . For a month , he had collected brochures in the bottom of his duffel bag . They had visited the Alamo , the Helium Monument , Dinosaur Valley , Prairie Dog Town , the Cave Without a Name , and the Tarantula Railroad , as well as museums-the Dr. Pepper Museum , the Jim Reeves Memorial , and the Buddy Holly Statue and Walk of Fame . <p> Currently , they were near Galveston , on their way to see the third oldest ship afloat . It did n't really matter where they went ; his mother looked through everything . Hugh wondered whether she had kept her job at the hospital , and how they were paying for the trip , and when if ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents took their weeklong summer vacation in Corpus , where his cousins Cecilia and Amien lived . But this year , Hugh 's mother had said she did n't want to deal with Aunt Beatrice-his father 's sister-and all the questions she would ask . <p> In their motel room , his mother brushed her teeth and washed her face , chiding Hugh 's father in the mirror . To keep from listening , Hugh turned on the TV ; the voice his mother used in the mirror had nothing to do with anything she 'd said to his father since he 'd left last fall . <p> Hugh changed into swimming trunks and a T-shirt , noticing , even in the room 's dim light , how dirty they were . He propped himself up against a headboard and tried to remember the last time his mother had washed his clothes . <p> As usual , they were sharing a room because his mother wanted to economize . When there was only one bed , like now , some motel clerks offered to set up a cot , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV . One minute , Mary Tyler Moore was there , then a silhouette of his mother 's plump body . Her nightgowns were blue and thin ; they seemed made not of fabric , but of smell : a warm , sweet odor of cold cream and sweat and flesh . She raised the stiff bedcovers and settled herself next to him . <p> " I still do n't see why we ca n't go , " he said . <p> " Please , honey . " His mother lay her hand across her forehead and shut her eyes . " We 've been over this a thousand times . " <p> " If Daddy was here , we 'd go . " Hugh said this not because he believed it , but to nettle her . " Everything was better when Daddy was around . We did n't drive all day and see boring things and stay in crummy motels . We were normal ! <p> His mother shielded her eyes . " The sun was brighter , the sky bluer , and you never had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " We floated through life on a pink perfumed cloud . " <p> Hugh laughed , but his throat ached , as it did when he cried . <p> " A pink perfumed cloud , " his mother said , glancing at him , tweaking his armpit . <p> Laughing , he squirmed away from her . It did n't feel like it used to , when they had sat on her bed , eating animal crackers and watching TV , waiting for his father to come home . Then , tickling had been a kind of relief . Now , it felt as if his mother were trying to make Hugh believe he was happy . She noodled his ribs , and he batted her hands away . <p> " Honey , " she said . " What 's wrong ? " <p> " I told you . " <p> " Do you really want to go ? " <p> " I told you , " he said , hiding his face from her . <p> He lay with his head in her lap . She stroked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father left , he often slept with her , as he had when he was very young . He knew that most eleven-yearold boys did n't cry on their mothers ' laps , or sleep with them , or allow themselves to be tickled , but he had n't told any of the boys at school what his life was like with his mother . That was why he wanted to go to Corpus . In summers past , he and Cecilia and Amien had snuck out , dressed as witches and gypsies , to tell each other secrets while their parents slept . <p> His mother got up to turn off the TV . When she lay down , Hugh listened to her breath slow and deepen . Streetlight bled across the ceiling above the room 's sole window . He tried to dream of Cecilia and Amien . Last July , their father had died . When Hugh and his parents had gone to the funeral , his cousins had kept their eyes downcast , and mouths tightly shut , and had hardly spoken to him . <p> Toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's back . Carefully , he propped himself up and drew back the covers . He studied her soft , sleeping , mysterious body , then covered her before she woke . <p> That morning , his mother told him they could go to Corpus . After they breakfasted at a diner across the parking lot from their motel , she found a pay phone and loaded it with coins . Hugh looked for the name of the motel , so he could tell his cousins where he 'd been , but all the sign said was " Motel . " " Hello , Bea ? " his mother said . " Oh , Cecilia ? How are you , darling ? Could you put your mother on ? " <p> The day was bright and hazy , already hot . Eighteen-wheelers moaned in the distance , then flashed past on the interstate , making rattletrap noises . His mother blinked in the flat white sunlight , as if for the first time on their trip she had woken up , and did n't particularly like what she saw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hair , which was threaded with gray , had outgrown its sensible cut . Though shadowed and lined by fatigue , her face was full and delicate , still beautiful in his eyes . <p> " Bea ? " she said . " This is Margot . We 're fine . He 's right here . " She glared at him . " He wants to visit the girls . I 'm sorry this is such short notice . We probably wo n't stay long . " She held the receiver against her chest , then spoke into it . " It 's very kind of you , Bea . We 'll see you soon . " <p> " I hope you appreciate this , " she said to him , when she hung up . <p> Late that afternoon , they parked in front of Aunt Beatrice 's house . The car shuddered , sighed , ticked in the heat . Hugh kept his eyes on a monster magazine . Three vampire girls , their hair long and blond , their eyes feline , sauntered through the archway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother said . <p> If Hugh looked closely , he could see through the vampire girls ' bloodstained dresses . " The Daughters of Lilith bleed their victims dry , " ran the caption . " But do these hapless lovers feel pleasure , or pain-or both ? ! - at the hands of Satan 's concubine ? " <p> " Let 's go , " said his mother , looking at his magazine . " What is this ? Where 'd you get it ? Put it away . You do n't want Beatrice to see it : ' <p> When he did n't move , she said , " What 's wrong , honey ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " What do you mean you do n't know ? " <p> Her question rankled him . " I do n't know . " <p> His mother reached for his armpit , then glanced at Aunt Beatrice 's neat suburban box . Hugh shrank against the passenger door . " If you do n't get out of this car on the count of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right around and go back . " <p> " Fine , " said Hugh . <p> His mother stuck the key in the ignition , then seemed to deflate . " Dammit , honey . What 're you going to do , sit out here ? " <p> " I might . " <p> " And what am I supposed to tell Beatrice ? " <p> " I do n't care . Tell her I died . " <p> Glowering at him , his mother got out and slammed her door . Hugh watched her disappear behind an azalea bush that hid Aunt Beatrice 's porch . A string stretched tight in his chest , but he did not follow her ; he looked at his magazine . Its back cover , which advertised magic kits and mind-reading courses , was torn from its stapled spine . A boy at school named Sam Fahr had lent it to him . Sam 's father had also left . Sometimes Sam 's mother let his father spend the night , and Sam described to Hugh the noises which came from her room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , would n't let men treat them as their fathers had their mothers . All summer , Hugh had imagined himself and Cecilia and Amien as vampires , marauding through the streets , then curling into a crypt , their bodies slick with gore . Now , in front of Aunt Beatrice 's house , he was afraid to show them the pictures . But he was more afraid that Aunt Beatrice would see them if she came to get him . He left his magazine in the car and approached the house . <p> Before he could knock , the front door opened with an air-conditioned sigh . Amien peeked out from behind it . She was a year younger than Hugh , three years younger than Cecilia ; a flouncy white dress covered a body as plump and awkward as his own . Her eyes , in her round , pale face , were dark , lustrous , and mean . <p> " Where 've you been ? " she said . " There 's something on your shirt . " <p> Blushing , Hugh looked down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you should come in . " Amien paused , holding the door ajar . " Cecilia and I have important things to do . Cecilia and I are allergic to dust . " <p> Wondering if his cousins had always been allergic to dust , Hugh entered a dim , familiar hallway . The house was hushed , as if everyone in it were waiting and hidden . <p> Amien slipped behind him to close the door , then stood close , studying him . " Our mothers are fighting in the kitchen , " she said . <p> " My mother says your mother 's insane . ' <p> Hugh 's heart sank . " Can we sneak out tonight ? " <p> Amien 's eyes narrowed . " We do n't play those kind of games anymore ! She walked briskly down the hallway and vanished into her room . <p> Hugh stood in the dim hallway . The house seemed to watch him . He ran to the kitchen and burst through its door . Aunt Beatrice and his mother turned , their mouths opened and eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his mother 's plump waist . <p> " Stop that , " his mother said , pulling him away . But he knew she would have gathered him into her soft lap if they had been alone . <p> " Look what you 've done to him , " Aunt Beatrice said . <p> Ready to show his aunt that nothing was wrong , Hugh faced her . <p> Sheathed in a pink housecoat as stiff and quilted as an oven mitt , Aunt Beatrice crouched in front of him , steadying herself on his shoulders . Her face was sharp , and her skin looked hollow , as if her insides had been dissolved by a wasting disease . She examined him with eyes darker , yet kinder , than Amien 's . " How are you , my little man ? " she said . <p> Hugh said that he was fine . <p> " You do n't look so fine to me . Did something frighten you ? " <p> " No , " he said . <p> Aunt Beatrice frowned . " Do you always miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand on the nape of his neck . " He 's tired : ' Aunt Beatrice neither moved nor took her eyes from him . Her eyes were close ; they seemed to almost touch him . " You 're not very talkative , " she said . " You 're not the bright little talkative man you used to be . Now why do you think that is ? " <p> " I do n't know , " he said . <p> She rose , pressing his shoulders . " Would you like to go to the beach tomorrow ? " <p> Hugh looked at his mother , who bit her lip . He asked Aunt Beatrice if his cousins were going ; she said they were . Though he was afraid , Hugh said that he would go . <p> That night , Hugh lay next to his mother on a foldout bed in the parlor . She kept her back to him , but he could tell by her breathing that she was awake . He looked at the ceiling , where leaves tousled by the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cot next to the bed . In the past , he 'd slept on a trundle in Cecilia 's room , but this year , Aunt Beatrice had taken his duffel bag to the parlor and told him he would sleep there . His cousins had refused to even come to dinner . <p> " Hugh , ' his mother said . " Are you awake ? " <p> Hugh said that he was . <p> " I 'm sorry about the girls . Maybe we should just leave . " <p> " But we 're going to the beach tomorrow . " <p> After a pause , his mother said , " You know why Beatrice wants you to go to the beach . She wants you to see how fun it is to live here . " <p> His mother was n't usually so concerned with what he thought . " That 's not true . " <p> She rolled over , her face red and convulsed . Hugh thought of a fat boy at school named Billy Flagg , whom the other boys teased each day until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I always knew Daddy was going to leave , " she said . " But I 've never felt that way with you . I never want to lose you . ' <p> As he had many times since his father left , Hugh drew his mother to himself , and felt her warm breath against his chest , and her body quake against his own . <p> " I wo n't leave , he said , hoping no one could hear them . <p> The next morning , Hugh did not look at his mother . Before she woke , he went to a bright yellow bathroom , where a mirror covered a wall above a pair of sinks . He turned on the shower and undressed , then tucked his private parts between his legs , wishing his cousins could see him from the mirror 's other side . <p> When he returned to the parlor , his mother was gone , so he went to the kitchen door . His aunt 's voice was like a sewing machine . She had called his grandmother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did she know where Hugh was going to go to school that fall ? Did she have a destination ? His mother said she did n't know . <p> " You do n't know much of anything , do you ? " Aunt Beatrice said . <p> " I guess I do n't , " said his mother . " I guess you 've got it all figured out . " <p> " Maybe I 've got it figured better than you . It 's been almost a year since Bobby left ; you need to start pulling things together , if not for yourself , at least for that poor child . " <p> " What do you think I 've been doing ? I get up and go to work and go to sleep and do it all over again . I feel like I 'm not even human . " <p> " It does n't matter how you feel . Do you think it 's been easy for me since David 's gone ? At least my brother 's still alive . " <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'm not saying you should " said his aunt . " I think you should stay here . ' <p> Before his mother could answer , Hugh opened the door . Aunt Beatrice turned to him , holding a large knife . On the counter next to her were cubes of cantaloupe and plastic bags . She had exchanged her pink housecoat for a purple muumuu printed with trumpet-shaped flowers . His mother still wore her denim dress . <p> " There you are , " Aunt Beatrice said , as if Hugh had been hiding from her . She told him to take the beach chairs and umbrella out of the garage and load them into his uncle 's station wagon . " You 're a big , strong man , " she said . " It should n't be a problem . " <p> His mother smiled at him , but her smile was distant and sad . <p> In the back of the station wagon , Hugh grappled with an umbrella and beach chairs , remembering how his uncle and father had tossed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them easily , but his uncle flinched , like a girl afraid of a baseball . Corpus had been different then . His mother , though timid with his father , used to keep Hugh in line with merely a glance . <p> His uncle had died in a car crash in Amarillo . Sometimes , Hugh wished his father had come to just as definite an end . He had never been around much , and now he was n't exactly gone . When Hugh was very young , his father had worked at the laboratory where Hugh 's mother worked , then went to medical school , then did his residency in Detroit , then served his time in the Army . When he returned last fall , he walked like a marionette , staring blindly ahead , as if he were not quite sure where he was . He lived briefly with Hugh and his mother , but also stayed with a girlfriend , and sometimes with Hugh 's grandmother . After he left , his shirts and ties still hung in Hugh 's mother 's closet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not his father 's absence , but his ghostly reappearances , which were driving his mother crazy . <p> Hugh felt someone watching him . Through a smudged window in the back of the station wagon , he saw , standing on the porch , a long-limbed girl with golden hair , whom he did not recognize at first as Cecilia . <p> They drove through winding streets , past identical houses , until they reached the beachfront road . There , the houses looked like abandoned movie sets , their pink adobe facades cracked and peeling . Dead palm trees swayed landward over the road . <p> In the front seat , Aunt Beatrice and his mother were silent . Hugh sat between his cousins in the back . Amien was pressed against her door , scowling at him . Her eyes were n't as mean as they had been in the house , but Hugh no longer cared . <p> He furtively studied Cecilia . Her face was covered with a vague , hazy film which Hugh had noticed on older girls . She looked out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be bothered with where she was . <p> The palm trees disappeared , and the flimsy houses were replaced with skittering fields of brush . " The beaches in town are n't safe anymore , " Aunt Beatrice said . <p> When they parked on a desolate shoulder paved with oyster shells , the sun was high and blinding . Cecilia and Amien tore out of the car and ran toward the beach , leaving the rest of them to unpack . After the chairs were set out , the umbrella planted , and a red cooler unloaded , Hugh 's mother rubbed sunscreen on him ; he twisted away from her . <p> Cecilia and Amien returned to shed their T-shirts and shorts . Both wore blue , one-piece bathing suits . When Cecilia bent to pick a handful of plastic bags out of the cooler , Hugh glimpsed the cleft between her breasts , and felt a hollow ache . <p> " Remember , girls , " Aunt Beatrice said . " Do n't walk past the pier . ) <p> Without acknowledging her , they raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hugh hesitated . " Go on , " his mother said , in the voice she used in the mirror with his father . " This is what you came for. , <p> Uncertain of what she meant , though cut by her tone , he started after them . Aunt Beatrice clasped his arm . " Keep an eye on them , my little man . " <p> Without meeting her eyes , Hugh nodded until she let him go . As he neared the ocean , seaweed , dead fish , and tar overwhelmed the babyish scent of his sunscreen . <p> Ahead , Cecilia tossed cubes of cantaloupe to chattering gulls , who swooped above the tidal water , then settled into their awkward , land-bound gaits . She walked as if she were watching herself in a secret mirror . Amien picked her way through broken bottles and bits of Styrofoam , scampering toward her sister with a gull 's mincing steps . <p> Afraid to come closer , Hugh slowed his pace . Cecilia stopped and turned to him . " We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mother does n't know about them . If you tell on us , I 'll strip you naked and lock you outside the house tonight . ' <p> Arms folded over her stomach , Amien nodded sternly . His cousins walked on , and Hugh fell in beside them . He wanted them to himself . <p> " What 's it like , living with your mom ? " Cecilia asked him . <p> " It 's okay , " he said cautiously . <p> " Our mother 's crazy . The only place she takes us is this crappy beach . " Cecilia 's eyes focused on a distant point . " D' you know about Janis Joplin ? I 'd give anything to live on the road like she did . Rick told me about getting high with her . " <p> " Who 's Rick ? " said Hugh , but Cecilia did n't answer . <p> Ahead loomed the pier , whose planks had mostly vanished , leaving a line of bare pilings to march into the waves . His cousins stopped behind one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , and her blue bathing suit flutter over her heart . <p> In a clearing in the scrub brush beyond the pier was a rough circle of cars , and men and women leaning on their hoods . The men wore cutoff jeans and concert T-shirts , the women , some not much older than Cecilia , bikini tops and jeans cut shorter than the men 's . Hugh had seen such people before , on beaches and in the parking lots of malls . Sam Fahr 's older brother was one of them . He flashed a switchblade so swiftly that Hugh had never actually seen it ; he only knew it was there enough to be afraid . <p> " Someone 's with him , " said Amien . <p> " I got eyes , " Cecilia said . <p> " What 're you going to do ? " <p> " I 'm gon na talk to him . " She looked at them . " I 've got nothing to be ashamed of . " <p> Cecilia walked slowly toward the cars . Amien let out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The people glanced at Cecilia . A man and woman , older than the rest , watched her closely . The man was tall and thin ; the woman 's face was as hard and still as a mask . The man hoisted himself up from the hood of his car and approached Cecilia . A thick , gray ponytail swung from the back of his head . <p> " Who 's that ? " Hugh said . <p> " It 's Rick , " said Amien , as if Rick were someone he should know . <p> Rick stopped close to Cecilia , and Hugh noticed how small she was . He brushed her hair from her face and let his hand settle on the nape of her neck . Amien 's dark eyes were riveted ; Hugh clenched his fists , his imagination bloody and heroic . Cecilia did not move . The woman turned to the people , who looked away . <p> " Is he Cecilia 's boyfriend ? " Hugh asked . <p> " No , " said Amien . " Of course not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear him . When he brought his face close to hers , she shook her head , like a horse refusing a bridle , and ran toward the pier . <p> By then , the people had noticed Hugh and Amien , and Rick lumbered toward them . They ran . Amien clutched Hugh 's hand , but let go of it when they neared Cecilia . <p> She wheeled on them . Her face was red , as his mother 's had been the night before , but Hugh felt none of the revulsion for her that he had for his mother . <p> " I 've got nothing to be ashamed of , " she said to him . " You understand ? " <p> " Yes , " he said , though he did n't . <p> " You 're my little girl , " ' she said to Amien , her voice bitter . <p> " That 's what he said to me . Then he tried to kiss me , right there in front of his girlfriend . " <p> Amien stared at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Hugh . " I swear if you breathe a word I 'll do worse than what I told you . " <p> " I wo n't , " he said . He thought : I will never hurt you . <p> " I know what he 's thinking , " she said to Amien . " He wants to make her jealous . But I 'm not gon na hang around just so they can laugh at me . " <p> Amien nodded , but her eyes were frightened and vacant . <p> " He 's like my father , " said Hugh . <p> Amien looked at him as if she wished he would disappear , but Cecilia 's gaze was sharp and searching . " If we sneak out tonight , " he said , " I 'll tell you all about him . ' <p> Amien turned away , but Cecilia said , " Maybe . ' <p> When they returned to Aunt Beatrice 's house , his cousins disappeared , and Hugh went to the bathroom , to avoid his aunt and mother . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An image haunted him : Rick bent over Cecilia , his wiry body enveloping her , his ponytail on his bare back , pendulous and obscene . <p> After his shower , he went to his uncle 's study , which was more dim and still than the rest of the house . Gilt lettering glimmered on bookcases in the wood-paneled gloom . He touched a pair of reading glasses on his uncle 's desk and felt a queasy shock . <p> He remembered his uncle lifting him to pluck oranges from a tree in the backyard . His hands had been gentle , his smile friendly , and Hugh had wished that he was his father . <p> " There you are , " Aunt Beatrice said . <p> Hugh turned to her . She stood very close to him . In the room 's pale light , her face was thinned almost to transparency . She asked him what he and his cousins had done at the beach , and he told her they had talked about Janis Joplin . <p> Hugh lay on the cot in the parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cousins would come . At dinner , they sat mutely through Aunt Beatrice 's interrogation , then retreated without a word to him . Hugh wished he had told on them , to protect them from Rick , to punish them for not coming , to insure that at least they would throw him out of the house naked . That might be easier than telling them about his father ; he had told no one about him , not even Sam Fahr . <p> " Hugh ? " his mother said . " Are you there ? " Hugh debated whether to answer . " Yes . ' he said . <p> " I want to leave . Your aunt means well , but she 's driving me crazy . <p> Hugh said nothing . His mother turned under the covers , and her scent breathed into the room . Arms at his sides , he lay rigid , furiously wishing she would sleep . <p> " Why do n't you come over here so we can talk ? " she said . <p> " I can hear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pause , she said , " I 'm scared , Hugh . Wo n't you please come here ? " <p> Hugh closed his eyes . His mother 's breath was shallow and quiet ; she waited for him . When his father spent the night , he lay in bed , listening to her plead with his father to stay , and his father 's murmurous answers , and his brutal grunts , and her thin cries . He knew what the sounds meant , and hated his father for hurting her , and his mother for submitting , and both of them for leaving it to him to comfort her . Now , as he listened to her breath slow and deepen into slumber , Hugh knew that he was no better than his father . <p> " Come on , " Cecilia whispered . <p> She stood over him , her face close to his . <p> Heart racing , he followed her to the living room , where she told him to wait until he heard his name , then slipped behind a wall of curtains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then heard his name , like wind through a porch screen , and lifted an edge of the curtains and slowly slid open a glass door . <p> At the far end of the sunroom , his cousins sat in a circle of candies , which cast their wavering shadows on the screen windows and aluminum walls . They were draped in paisley dresses and flowing scarves ; their faces looked masked and strange . <p> " Close the door , " Cecilia said . <p> Fingers trembling , Hugh slid the door closed , remembering how they had danced here while their parents slept , their faces white , lips blood-red , fingers bent like claws . He had told them he wanted to live with them , but he could not remember their secrets anymore . <p> " Come here , " Cecilia said . <p> As he approached , he saw that his cousins ' eyelids were green and purple , their lips a glistening pink , their faces dusted with sparkles . Amien 's was pale and brooding , and Cecilia 's seemed drained by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gypsy , his face painted like theirs . <p> " Sit down , " she said . <p> Hugh stepped over the candles , their warmth tickling the soles of his feet , and sat cross-legged on the floor . The room disappeared behind the candlelight . <p> " We speak to the dead and tell the future and read people 's minds , " said Cecilia . " We 're going to read yours , to see if you should live with us . " <p> When he did n't answer , she pressed her fingers to her temples and fluttered her eyelids . " I hear your mother crying in my dreams . " <p> " She misses your father , " said Amien . <p> " She misses you . " Cecilia stared at him . " She 's afraid you 'll run away and live with us . She 's afraid of your father , who wo n't leave her alone . " <p> A night breeze fluttered the candles , and his cousins ' faces shifted . Hugh was frightened by how much they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Tell me about Rick " he said . <p> " That 's none of your business , " said Amien . <p> His cheeks burned , and he looked away from them , but Cecilia leaned toward him .

" <p> The image of Rick 's bare back returned . Hugh glanced at <p> Amien , but she would not meet his eyes . " What do you do ? " he asked Cecilia . <p> " What do you think we do ? " <p> I do n't know . " <p> " Really ? " Cecilia smiled . " You do n't know what people do ? " <p> " I know . " Hugh stopped , aware of the trap into which he 'd fallen . His cousins studied him , their eyes curious and hooded . <p> " Then why do n't you tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read his mind , their game would end . " My father is a vampire , " he said .

" Cecilia asked , her stare intent , her face glittering . <p> He had no words for what it sounded like . Instead , he beat the floor , uttering high , sharp cries , until his fist was numb . No longer smiling , Cecilia caught his hand and unfolded his fingers . <p> " Is it true ? " Amien asked her . <p> " Of course it 's true . " Cecilia pressed his hand . " That 's why his mother 's crazy . " <p> " He 's lying , ' Amien said . " That 's not what people sound like . ' <p> " How would you know ?

' <p> " I do n't care " <p> " Then leave . " Cecilia did n't look at her . " Go to your room and be quiet . ' <p> Amien hovered over them . For a moment , Hugh thought she would scream , but she fled to the sliding doors . Cecilia regarded him evenly . <p> " Is it true ? " she said . " I mean , not really true , but true your dad comes around ? " <p> He nodded , looking at their hands . <p> " Everything I told you about Rick is a lie .

" <p> Hugh knew she was lying . When he looked at her , though , he saw that she believed what she 'd said . She pulled him up by his hand , and he could not help but feel dizzy and blessed . They blew out candles until it was dark , and then Cecilia was gone . <p> Before dawn , Hugh woke his mother and told her that he wanted to leave . While the house still slept , they packed their bags and snuck out to the car . <p> At sunrise , they tilted onto the Corpus Christi Bridge and rose into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves below , and imagined the car spinning off the bridge and crashing into them . He wished it would happen . He had betrayed his mother for nothing . There was nowhere else to go . <p> He did not know that in a week , he and his mother would return to Houston . His mother would get her job at the hospital back and work overtime to pay off her credit cards . His father would appear less and less , until he faded into Christmastime visits . The summer before his first year of high school , Aunt Beatrice would call to tell his mother that Cecilia had run away , and Hugh would find himself waiting for her , though he knew she would never come . By then , he and his mother would move carefully around each other , spending their evenings in separate rooms , shutting their doors at bedtime . They would mention their last trip to Corpus , when they mentioned it at all , as if it had happened to other people . <p> But now they are in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright . His mother has just finished brushing her teeth and changing for bed . She glides past Hugh , who is sitting crosslegged on their bed , staring at the dead , green eye of the TV . <p> She lifts the covers and settles herself on a pillow against the headboard . Her scent wafts toward him , and he tries to believe it is filthy . She dons a pair of glasses , opens a book , then lowers it . " What 's gotten into you ? " she says . <p> " Nothing . " <p> " Are you still upset about Corpus ? " <p> " No . " <p> " I told you we should n't have gone . If you 're upset , it 's your own fault . " <p> Hugh looks at her . Behind her reading glasses , her eyes are warped and peevish . " I 'm not upset " he says to the TV . " And it 's not my fault . " <p> " Really ? Whose fault is it ? " <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you mean , " she says indignantly ; but he knows she is afraid . <p> He turns to her . " You keep pretending like you do n't know what I mean so you can keep acting crazy . But I 'm not crazy . I 'm not a freak . You 're a big , fat freak , and everyone can see it . " <p> " What happened , honey ? " <p> He looks away . In the TV , they are faceless , huddled shadows . <p> " Hugh ? " she says . " Do you want a house like Aunt Beatrice 's ? " <p> " No . <p> " Do you want sisters like Cecilia and Amien ? " <p> " No . <p> " Do you want another daddy ? " <p> " No , " he says , afraid of what he will say to her . " Leave me alone . " <p> " Why , honey ? What did I do ? Please tell me what I did wrong . " <p> She leans toward him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she sees him glance at them , and covers them with her arm . <p> " I do n't want to be here , " he says . " I have n't ever wanted to be with you . " <p> " Am I really that bad ? " <p> " Yes . " Hugh thinks : No , you 're not . If she 's that bad , then he is , too . But what he says is true enough , hurtful enough , for the moment . " Yes , " he says . " You really are . " <p> Her eyes strain through her glasses . He can not stand her eyes on him anymore . <p> Swiftly , he wiggles a finger into her plump armpit . She lets out a yelp , then yaws backward , trying to escape . She catches his ribs , and he falls on her hand , but she tweaks him behind his knee . He springs like a doused cat . He wriggles and kicks , but here she comes . She has him now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering if anyone can hear them , and if so , what they must think . He imagines how they must look in the dead , green eye of the TV : a plump boy wriggling beneath his half-naked mother , who giggles while she tickles him . He kicks the air . She tickles the soles of his feet . It is delicious , unbearable . He bats her hands from his chest , and they go under his arms , he bats them from there , and they go under his knees , like a crazy , short-circuiting machine . Around and around go her hands , and his hands chase them . He clutches her arm , ready to beg mercy , but he will stay here just a moment longer . He writhes , gasps , thinking : This is not how it should be ; thinking : I do not know how it should be . <p>
