<p> SALT LAKE CITY  --  There was no fanfare last week when Silvia Salguero walked into the lecture hall for her first class at the University of Utah . And she looked like just about any other new freshman  --  shy , a little nervous  --  as she stood in line to buy textbooks . <p> But back home , her family and friends quietly cheered her on , proud and grateful for her trailblazing role in changing a law  --  and some minds  --  that were preventing children of undocumented immigrants such as herself from pursuing a college education . <p> Back in 2000 , it had n't occurred to Salguero or her teachers at Park City High School that her background would pose a problem at college . With a 3.2 grade-point average , a letter of admission to the university and $ 4,000 in scholarships , she seemed to have everything she needed to succeed . <p> Except , it turned out , a Social Security number . <p> Seven years ago , at age 13 , Salguero fled her native Mexico with her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a December night , they crossed the border into the Arizona desert , then ran two miles to a waiting car . A few days later they joined Salguero 's mother and other family members in Utah . <p> Though undocumented adults typically keep a low profile for fear of deportation , a 1982 Supreme Court ruling says their children should not be punished for their unlawful actions and are entitled to an education in U.S. public schools . College admission officials did n't see anything amiss on Salguero 's application , although she had left the citizenship box blank . <p> Only when Salguero tried to pay the university tuition did she discover that her legal right to a public education had ended with high school . To enroll at the university , she would have to return to Mexico , get a student visa , then re-apply as a foreign student and pay the non-resident rate , roughly three times the rate for Utahans . In other words , she says , it spelled the end to " all my hopes and dreams . " <p> Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting the same brick wall as they come closer to achieving the goals their parents had hoped for them . It 's up to states to set the policies of their public universities . But on this issue , a key barrier is a federal law that discourages states from treating undocumented students as state residents entitled to lower tuition rates . Any state that offers in-state tuition or other higher education benefits to undocumented immigrants must do the same for out-of-state residents . <p> Of the estimated 50,000 to 70,000 undocumented students graduating each year from U.S. high schools , only a few have set their sights on college ; many more drop out before the 12th grade , experts say . But as the numbers of college hopefuls grow and stories like Salguero 's come to light , teachers , church groups and others are urging state lawmakers to find a way around the federal law . <p> Now , with Salguero beginning her freshman year this semester , Utah becomes the fourth state , after Texas , California and New York , to admit undocumented students under laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And similar proposals are being considered in other states , including Massachusetts , Illinois , North Carolina and Minnesota . <p> Giving students a chance <p> The state laws do not change a student 's legal status with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service , however . " The matter of awarding someone in-state tuition is a state issue ; it 's not an INS issue , " INS spokesman Chris Bentley says . " Anyone who is in the United States without legal status is subject to removal . . . if INS comes in contact with them . " <p> That could change . In Congress , word of Salguero 's plight led two Utah Republicans  --  Orrin Hatch in the Senate and Chris Cannon in the House  --  to introduce legislation that would make it easier for states to exempt undocumented students from non-resident tuition if they choose to , and provide a pathway for those students to become legal U.S. citizens . <p> Proponents hope the bill , dubbed the Dream Act , will become federal law this year . But with immigration policy already controversial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the idea of extending a new benefit to undocumented immigrants has sparked a contentious debate . <p> Supporters say there 's everything to be gained by giving students like Salguero the chance to improve their lives . With a college education , they can better support themselves and their families . They 'll pay more in taxes , depend less on social services and contribute their skills to the community , supporters say . Salguero , for instance , wants to be a nurse , a profession that is suffering a shortage . <p> " We benefit by having them here , particularly now that they are poised to repay our educational investment , " says Josh Bernstein of the National Immigration Law Center , a Los Angeles-based group that supports immigrants . " It 's stupid  --  and tragic  --  to quash the hopes of the very ones that are most likely to succeed . " <p> Consider Jesus Loya , 19 , who graduated with Salguero . When he arrived in Utah five years ago , he spoke no English and was so shy he would hide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he works two full-time jobs , one managing a department for a manufacturing company , and saved $ 2,500 for college , which he hopes to start in May . " I want to be a pilot , to go to different places , " he says . <p> For others , the possibility of college offers an incentive to stay in school . Already , the Utah law has drawn eight Park City dropouts back , and two have since graduated , says Park City High School Spanish teacher Gerry Maak , a friend and mentor to undocumented immigrants . She spearheaded state efforts to help Salguero and those who would follow . " They all now see opportunities they did n't have before , " she says . <p> But critics argue that such a policy rewards lawbreakers and encourages even more people to try to enter the USA illegally . " It really is a slap in the face to millions of legal immigrants who abided by the rules and waited many years ( for ) their turn , " says Steven Camarota of the Center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make all those people who played by the rules look like fools . " <p> Others question the wisdom of expanding access when state budgets are tight and already-high demand for college is forcing the most selective public universities to turn students away . Last fall , Virginia Attorney General Jerry Kilgore warned state colleges not to enroll illegal immigrants and to report those they find on campus to federal authorities . <p> " It is outrageous that in these tough economic times , when tuition is being raised on students and families , that those who are breaking our laws are receiving taxpayer funds and potentially taking a spot away from a Virginia student , " Kilgore says . <p> Support from Utahans <p> Some of Utah 's most conservative leaders were initially against any special treatment for undocumented immigrants . But stories told by students and their families led to some 180-degree turns . <p> A University of Utah study , based on U.S. Census data , shows that Utah 's Hispanic ( mostly Mexican ) population , including documented and undocumented immigrants , shot up 138% in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , a skier 's mecca where hospitality-industry jobs are plentiful . <p> Salguero 's mother , Silvia Huerta Salguero , a prep cook whose forearms bear red markings from splattering hot oil , often puts in 10 or more hours a day to help support her seven children  --  of whom Silvia is the eldest . <p> Speaking in Spanish , she says her family left Mexico because " there was so much violence " in the rural town where they lived , and because " it was an opportunity for ( the children ) to go to school . " <p> Says State Rep. David Ure , who represents the district where the Salgueros live , " That takes a lot of courage , and those are the kind of people that built America . <p> " If they 're screwing up , they ought to ( be deported ) , " says Ure , a self-described right-winger . " But for those who have a desire to further themselves , to make America better or Utah better , we better find a way to do it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In pushing for the law on the Senate floor , he likened the kids he talked with to Rosa Parks . <p> Opponents in the House , where the measure squeaked by , question some politicians ' motives for supporting the tuition break . " They like the cheap labor , and they 're after votes , " says Rep. Matt Throckmorton , a Republican . A better idea , he and others argue , would be for the U.S. to enforce existing laws and improve border control . <p> Still , officials say , undocumented college students hardly get a free ride . They must meet academic requirements to be admitted . And they still have to pay in-state tuition , about $ 3,000 a year at the University of Utah . That 's " still far beyond the means of most " families , says Barb Snyder , vice president of student affairs . <p> And for now , they do n't qualify for Pell Grants or other federal aid for low-income students . <p> Many , including Salguero , also help support their families . Though Salguero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's alumni association , she arranged her course schedule so she could work full time in the housekeeping department at a ski resort . <p> " I know it 's hard for them to understand , " she says of those who disagree with the law . " But if they were in my position , they would ( want ) the same thing . I need to be an example for my family , for my little sisters . So I 'm just trying to do the best I can .
