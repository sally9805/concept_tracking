The arrest and indictment of a Saudi graduate student in Idaho last week may have been an important first step in busting up the burgeoning links between Islamic extremism and the World Wide Web . Sami Omar al-Hussayen , a Ph.D . candidate in computer security at the University of Idaho , was charged with violating conditions of his student visa by registering and maintaining a dozen militant websites promoting violence against U.S. interests . U.S. officials want to know more about al-Hussayen 's work for the sponsor of most of these sites , the radical Islamic Assembly of North America ( IANA ) , a Michigan-based group known as one of the most strident voices of Islam on the Web . IANA hosted the websites of two radical Saudi sheiks  --  Salman al-Awdah and Safar al-Hawali  --  both of whom are closely associated with Osama bin Laden and who provided religious justification for the Sept. 11 attacks , according to the SITE Institute , a Washington-based terrorist-research group that monitors the Internet . In the recent German trial of Mounir El Motassadeq , an accomplice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerics . <P> Al-Hussayen 's case also may provide fresh evidence that at least some of these anti-American websites are being supported by funds coming from Saudi Arabia . Al-Hussayen is accused of covertly receiving $300,000 from abroad and disbursing much of it to IANA . Law-enforcement sources tell TIME that about $100,000 of those funds came from radical Islamic interests in Saudi Arabia . A Saudi-embassy spokesman in Washington said no government money has gone to IANA.  --  By Elaine Shannon and Michael Weisskopf
