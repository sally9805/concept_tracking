I could only get tickets to tonight 's portion , but at least we 'll be seeing it , right ? ! ( Facing front ) ( happy ) I mean , ballroom dance , man ! Ballroom dance !

And I loved them all , especially the cha-cha ! But you see at the classes , the girls way outnumbered the boys , like 40 to four . And none of my brothers or male cousins were interested in practicing let alone taking classes . So , I quit . But I studied ballet . ( PEN demonstrates a ballet position. ) @x ( PEN demonstrates the Irish dance . ) Of course you 're not supposed to wear tap-shoes , because it changes everything ... it changes sound , position , feel . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause you had to break them in by wearing them around your house for at least fifteen minutes every day for many months . And Mom would n't let me touch her tiles with what she called the ... p. 10 MAN ... the clunky , chunky , ugly , pug-nosed shoes . PEN So I was confined to the windowless , telephone-less , t.v. - free , coffin-sized laundry room . It was understandable because Mom really did have these marvelous marble and hardwood floors scattered throughout the house . It 's just that I got tired of pacing the same tight space back and forth , back and forth , in shoes that felt like thumbscrews . And so I just put on my tap-shoes instead , and it was great . It was okay . It just was not real . I thought maybe I 'd feel better if I had a boy to practice with . ( eyes MAN ) I did get a new boyfriend , but not exactly a dancer , let alone an Irish one . Louie Rodriguez . MAN Not exactly a Bar-Mitzvah boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years older than me ! ( PEN moves down left . ) And he and his best friend , Jose , were such great baseball players that they were both being scouted ! Anyway , Louie was so classy . He lived right around the corner from these two swanky restaurants ... one was Spanish , one was Italian . And every weekend like clockwork he would take me out to at least one of them . And I remember , it was holiday time , Christmas/Hanukkah time . And the Spanish place brought in these flamenco dancers and guitarists , and I was hooked ! Well , after the holidays , I was still drooling for flamenco . Finally , it arrived , about eight minutes by car from where I lived , at the Neighbors Playhouse ! And Louie was so classy , he was so fine , he got us tickets , I did not have to ask him , or beg him , or bribe him , or bust him , he just got them . I remember he was waiting in his car outside my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gig . And I went inside to kiss my mom goodnight ... my folks had been separated for almost a year . And I remember I could smell my way to Mom because she was cooking kosher meatballs and spaghetti for my younger siblings . p. 11 MAN ( moves down ) I do n't like what you 're wearing , so , off with it now ! PEN Well , I liked what I was wearing . I mean , I was sixteen and a half almost , and I was rather conservative considering my bohemian mentality . I was wearing these nice , beige , corduroy slacks with this beautiful ivory colored , knit top , that was knit by my grandma and it had this gorgeous sweetheart neckline with ruffles , and matching knit cuffs at the end of long sleeves .

But Mom wanted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice Jewish boy or any of their mothers at the Playhouse . PEN But the Playhouse was like Broadway ... anything went . Taffeta gowns or torn-by-accident jeans . I was dressed as an upscale compromise . MAN Look , Penelope , just because Louie is your date , it does n't mean you have to dress like a shiksa . Pretty soon , Penelope , you 'll start to dress like Jose 's girlfriend . Maybe you 'll even dye your skin , Penelope . p. 12 PEN Jose was black . Well , I reminded Mom that the hand-knit blouse I was wearing was hand-knit by my Jewish grandma . MAN It was knit by your PATERNAL Jewish grandma ... end of discussion ! PEN Then I reminded Mom that just as many people wear jeans to the Playhouse as taffeta , including people her age . MAN Age has nothing to do with taste ... look at your father ! PEN Then I reminded Mom that obviously my father was her taste , otherwise why 'd she marry him , duh , and then she poured the boiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! PEN I shielded my face with my hands , my arms , and my wrists which collected quite some blisters . So did the tip of my nose . But let 's face it , it would 've been worse had I not been wearing grandma 's long sleeves . ( MAN moves up. ) @x ( PEN sits in the rightmost chair . ) I mean , she had problems . She ... Mom had had a lousy childhood . Her sisters have always confirmed it . They all hid in closets at different times to avoid their father 's strap and other crap . And the girls also played second fiddle to their brothers , their brothers had a lot of parties ... Mom could be counted on ruining every single one . Ironically , Mom , who was so outspoken , would end up in the closet a lot . They say abuse breeds abuse , right ? Inevitably she was diagnosed as a manic depressive , but she refused help ... medication or therapy . She was always saying she 'd rather spend the money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have quality furniture . PEN Well inevitably , Dad got fed up and made Mom see a shrink . That was after the live-in housekeeper idea completely failed . You see , Mom had previously tried to convince Dad that she 'd be a much healthier mother if she had live-in help . So pronto like , Dad got her this fabulous woman from West Africa ... Senegal , I believe ... Beverly . But Mom started being abusive to Beverly . p. 15 MAN What ? She taught you a " special African-ethnic dance " ? . PEN ( stands ) Yes ! ( PEN moves down center and demonstrates the dance . ) Anyway , the shrink thing completely failed as Mom started using it as a confessional . So , Dad made Mom see another shrink , and that completely failed , and so Dad moved out , about forty-five minutes away , ( moves right ; MAN crosses left ) to this nice condominium , but he made it emphatically clear to his kids that we could move in with him whenever we wished . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good things about Mom . She was proud ; she dressed us to the nines . She bought us all these toys and dolls and books ... she got me thirty-seven versions of " Alice in Wonderland " ! She was a great baker . And she was very conscientious about our regular medical checkups . She 'd keep us home from school even when we said we felt better . And she was affectionate , like with calling me " Alice . " She would playfully pat the middle of my face , and then she would take her thumb , and stick it in between her two fingers and say , " Got your nose ! " And I 'd say , ( sung ) " Give it back ! " ( spoken again ) And she would playfully put it back , and then she 'd playfully pat the top of my head whenever I would stick up for a sibling and then she would smack the top of ... but ... she was protective , because once a classmate beat me up . p. 16 MAN So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like siblings . Needless to say , the school principal had a serious chat with Mom and Dad . Well like I said , I missed her . It 's not that we did not have communication , we had communication . I mean , she would call us , and then she would visit us every blue moon , in the lobby of Dad 's condominium . The visits were always supervised by a relative on Dad 's side or a doorman . But I wanted to go outside ... you know , it was time . It was holiday time : Christmas/Hanukkah time . And as an upcoming birthday present for Mom I wanted to take her to a swanky restaurant . Mom 's a Capricorn ... you know , the " goat . " Actually , she was born smack on Christmas day .... MAN Christian business . Tricks of shiksas . PEN And it always ticked her off . ( pause ) Oh , I remember trying to find the perfect birthday card for Mom before I took her out . So there I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card section of the shop , and I found the perfect card . It said , " Happy Birthday , Mom . " And then I opened it and it said , " NO ONE BEATS YOU ! " That of course made me want to torch the store . But instead I visualized buying a pair of bongos ... ' cause they 're made of goat-skin . And then I bought Mom a perfectly pretty blank card , and then I bought myself that " No one beats you " card and I just kept it in a drawer . Each year it sort of became a ritual to take Mom out around her birthday . And she 'd always stay at this ritzy hotel in the upper East Eighties . She still lived in Millburn , New Jersey , but she liked room service . Anyway , I remember wanting to take her out to a fancy dance club . p. 17 MAN So I can meet a guy who 's loaded or someone who knows one . PEN Or so I could meet a dance partner or someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge , and I met a partner right out of " Saturday Night Fever " ! I was so in awe of him , and he was so in awe of himself that he did not notice . But did I care ? I had a lean , mean dance machine , so let him preen ! It 's just that after a couple of dances , he dumped me and found someone else to dance by himself with . Meanwhile , Mom hit it off with these two middle-aged , professorial , pipe-smoking types . Actually , they were professional photographers and they said that they lived in Chelsea , and in Soho . Unfortunately for Mom , they were married ... to their high-school or college sweethearts who were at a spa for the weekend . But that did not deter Mom , no no no no no , she was determined ; she liked talking . MAN With classy , distinguished , Jewish men . PEN So she did so for over an hour and then she called it a night . Then she hailed a cab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Port Authority on their way back to Chelsea and Soho . And Mom was so happy ! MAN They 'll be more conservative drivers that any New York cabbie ! PEN The problem was , we did not stop at the Port Authority . And we did not stop at Chelsea . Or Soho . We did not stop until we were way outside of Manhattan . I honestly do n't know where the men took me . It was freezing outside . Pitch black . Mid-December . Two in the morning . They made me sit on their laps while they took pictures of me . I remember the room was strewn with these fancy framed photos of grade-school girls ... some as young as elementary school age . And I remember the men forcing me to talk . p. 18 MAN Penny , Alice , dearest , you better say something ! PEN So I asked them if the photos were of their daughters or of their nieces . MAN Would n't that be nice ? ! PEN Then I thought of asking them if anything they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that photography obviously meant something a bit different to them . But I opted to shut my mouth . Then an hour later , they let me go , and I ran so fast , so far , I never looked back . Then a cop drove by on the main drag and I hailed him , and he stopped . And I told him what happened , and that I really wanted to find the abductors ' house . MAN Look , Ms. , it 's all your fault since you willingly got in the abductors ' car . PEN So the cop dropped me off at the Port Authority and then a bus dropped me off in front of Dad 's condominium . And I never told Dad what happened , I mean , even though my folks were divorced for a year , I never told Dad ; never told anyone ... never told Mom , but I never partied with Mom again . It 's not that I blamed her , it 's just ... I lost interest . I remember Ned saying . MAN Never say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that ? MAN ( stands ) @x ( MAN sits . ) I graduated NYU and became a receptionist in this swanky New York City law-firm , and I partied up the wazoo , I went to all these discos and dance-clubs and night-clubs and dances ! But I never met a dance partner . The men I met were n't interested in dancing in the future or the present . So I abstained from clubs . And men . But I bought a pair of bongos . ( PEN demonstrates playing . ) But you see , bongos are supported by your knees and your thighs , and I started to develop severe cramps in the right side of my pelvis . So , I bought a stand , and I placed the bongos on the stand and played standing up . ( PEN demonstrates playing . ) It was great ! It was okay . It 's just that I started to resent that I could not play like those huge , Afro-Cuban dudes . So I quit . I guess some things are better off between your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's birthday again . But like I said , I never partied with her again . But I got her this great card  --  this Alice in Wonderland card , with the John Tenniel illustration . It was this full-colored picture of Alice looking up at the Cheshire Cat with his huge carnivorous grin ... or maybe she was holding the pig . But it was brilliant , as a matter of fact , you opened up the card , and it said , " Alice wishes you a brilliant birthday . " Mom liked it so much she called me. p. 20 MAN What a perfect card from my Jewish Alice In Wonderland ! PEN That 's a first . MAN What ? PEN You 're so ... specific . MAN Well , you 're a special Alice . PEN Okay . MAN It gives Alice more character having an ethnic look . Why settle for ditsy , shiksa chic ? ( pause ) @x ( pause ) It was announced that my trial would be two days later . If I was found innocent , I 'd be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be given water , carrots , and a large looking-glass . But just as my trial was underway , an absolutely fabulous rabbit appeared . Well , fabulous until he was right next to me and I could not at all distinguish him from the rest of Wonderland . Anyway , the rabbit announced that the Queen of Parts had been murdered . Apparently , a rather large group of tourists who had never seen the Queen mistook her for a cow . They abducted her and brought her home and they fattened their lips with her . Which , I 've since been told , is exactly what the Queen did to HERSELF with a bevy of bovines . Free of the Queen , I left the stand , only to be challenged by the rabbit . MAN Order in the court , daughter of Baltimore ! We still have not resolved who stole the parts . I say it 's YOU ! PEN Well , I was absolutely at the end of my tether . After all , I was starving , sleep-deprived , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-strung lungs , I announced , " Who cares for you ? You are nothing but a pack of HACKS ! " With that , the subjects threw objects at me . So , I dodged them as best I could from behind the witness box as there was nowhere else to hide . I mean , there was n't a judge 's chamber as there was n't a judge . Knives , scissors , razors , hatchets , broken pieces of teacup and a guillotine to boot were thrown my way when I spied the Noble Nose at the back of the courtroom . By this time , all of the subjects had taken to fighting each other , and objects were doing the same . The sword and the chainsaw were really going at it . Well , I ran to the back of the room , and I begged the Noble Nose to give me a lift , and it did . We were exhausted after an hour of running . The nose , physically . Me , emotionally . So , we rested a bit . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so glad I spotted you ! You are a lifesaver ! You 're going to make some face so happy ! " And then it hit me . " Nose , you do a lot of running . Are you always fleeing things or mainly late ? " But the Noble Nose nodded off . It was then I realized how exhausted I was . My eyelids got heavier and heavier , and even the Noble Nose 's amplified snoring could not distract me . When I woke , I was back in my bedroom in North Bergen , New Jersey ! ( moves left ) But I ran to my full-length mirror just to make sure everything was the same . ( MAN crosses right. )
