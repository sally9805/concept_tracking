Manufacturing the Dominant Doctor // It was the first week in July at the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston and a new crop of interns has just arrived in the teaching hospital . A nurse named Deborah Madison was taking care of Ella , a forty-two-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer who was about to begin her first round of chemotherapy . Madison had worked on this cancer unit for the past five years . When she examined her patient , she found that Ella was anxious about the chemotherapy and was also in excruciating pain from the cancer . // As Ella 's primary nurse , Madison had great deal of experience diagnosing and treating cancer pain . She immediately recognized that Ella needed intravenous morphine to control her suffering . But she worked in a system where doctors-even doctors with as little experience as interns beginning their residency training-were the only ones permitted to diagnose , treat , and prescribe . Indeed , for internal medicine services , newly minted doctors , under the supervision of residents , fellows , and attending physicians , were nominally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reassuring Ella that she would do something to ease her pain , Madison walked down to the nurses ' station in search of the intern in charge of the case . The young man , upon whose orders much of her work depended , was in his late twenties , tall , clean-shaven , with close-cropped black hair . He listened as Madison explained the problem and related her treatment recommendation . // " I do n't know , " the intern said nervously . " I do n't think the patient is really in pain . I think she 's just anxious about the chemo she 'll be getting tomorrow . I 'll write an order for Xanax ( a tranquilizer ) and that should do it . " // Cognizant that she was there not only to care for patients , but also to teach novice physicians , Madison calmly repeated that the patient was having cancer pain . Xanax , while useful to treat any anxiety she might have also been feeling , would not alleviate her cancer pain . Morphine would . The intern , who like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suggestion . No , he said adamantly , adding that he would go and see the patient . // About five minutes later , if that , he returned . // The patient , he informed Madison , was not in pain . It was just as he thought . She was anxious about her chemo. // " Did she say that ? " Madison asked . // " No , " he said , " the patient complained of pain . " " But , " he added , as he wrote the order for the Xanax , " she ca n't really be in pain because people who are in pain do n't smile at their doctors . " // Although frustrated that this young physician seemed unaware that , as one recent federal report documented , " patients may be experiencing excruciating pain even while smiling and using laughter as coping mechanisms , " Madison once again tried to teach the young man about cancer pain as well as patients ' responses to vulnerability and dependence . Patients , she counseled , often smile at their doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't want to bother , contradict , or potentially alienate someone upon whom they depend for their very lives . // The intern was unmovable. // Over the course of the next two hours , Madison shifted tactics . Following the appropriate channels , she paged the resident who ranked above this intern in the medical chain of command . She would try to convince him to talk to the novice doctor and secure pain medication for her patient . When the resident responded to the page , he agreed with Madison . Morphine was just what the intern should order . The two went off to find the intern and the resident repeated to the young man exactly , almost word for word , what Madison had said about the rationale for this particular choice of drug . Listening to the senior doctor and ignoring the nurse , the intern nodded and dutifully wrote the order for the narcotic . // Madison went back to the patient and told her that the doctor had ordered the drug . She then administered the medication and monitored its effectiveness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient 's problem and recommended the correct treatment for it , when the interaction was recorded in the patient 's chart , the intern was given credit for both making the diagnosis and ordering the medication . When Ella was about to leave the hospital several days later , she wrote notes to thank her caregivers . Although she jotted a short thank-you note to her nurses , there was no mention of what the nurse did to help relieve her pain . In fact , she saved most of her gratitude for her doctors . " Thank you so much , " she told the intern , " for all you did for me. " // Risky Business // When nurses go to work in a hospital or other health care institution , they expect to confront a certain number of predictable risks . They may injure their backs if they try to turn a patient without help , or lift a patient who 's fallen in the cramped space of a hospital bathroom . They may stick themselves with an infected needle because another hospital worker has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not purchase safe needles . They may contract a new and mysterious disease like SARS . They may be verbally or physically attacked by a mentally ill patient who becomes violent or by a patient or family member frustrated with an increasingly impersonal health care system . Through a variety of workplace and legislative measures , nurses try to minimize these risks . // Other less publicized risks that nurses encounter jeopardize their patients . On a daily basis , nurses work with physicians who fail to communicate with them about critical clinical issues , deny them access to needed information and resources , subject them to verbal abuse when they try to do their job , and misinterpret collegial disagreements about clinical issues as challenges to medical authority and hierarchy . Some physicians rudely overrule nurses ' clinical concerns and subject nurses to verbal abuse and humiliation . In rarer cases , some physicians physically abuse RNs . Added to this is the fact that the medical system often gives physicians credit for nurses ' contributions . This means nurses have little experience with positive credit but have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these patterns of communication and behavior make nursing a very risky job , and not only for the so-called uppity nurse who refuses to couch her questions and concerns in the demure rituals of medical dominance . // Even nurses who work hard at staying in their assigned place by observing the accepted rules of deference may find that MD-RN relationships can be hazardous to their professional self-esteem , as well as to their personal health and well-being . The incident I described above , for example , happened at a hospital in which nurses received a great deal of credit for their work . It occurred during the heyday of nurse empowerment in the early 1990s . But no matter how much institutional support nurses had-support that has , we shall see , largely disappeared today-they were still stuck in a medical system characterized by rigid inequality . While there is increasing attention to the problem of " disruptive physicians " - who often bully those they consider to be inferiors-little systematic attention is paid to the fact that the medical system as a whole is a disruptive , sometimes toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interruptus // Over the past thirty years , many articles have been written about this structured inequality . Two of the most famous- " The Doctor-Nurse Game " and " The Doctor-Nurse Game Revisited , " published in 1967 and 1990 respectively-were written by the psychiatrist Leonard Stein . The original article analyzed why doctors failed to consult with nurses and why nurses adopted indirect or even passive-aggressive strategies to deal with doctors . Then in 1990 , during the last nursing shortage , Stein and two other physicians reexamined the state of nurse-physician relationships . The authors argued that the women 's and civil-rights movements had fomented a rebellion among nurses . More nurses , the authors insisted , were socialized outside the old hospital schools , had advanced degrees , and wanted to be viewed as " autonomous , " " independent " professionals . The " new " nurse was more than willing to make direct recommendations . In fact , many bluntly challenged physicians . Others exhibited outright hostility to MDs . Some seemed to want to replace physicians and claim , as their own " domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronic illness , and holistic care or " treatment of the whole person " - things which doctors should do but too often ignore . // The " Doctor-Nurse Game Revisited " suggested that nurse-physician relationships were improving , because nurses were no longer tolerating medicine 's traditional dominance . Twelve years later , however , one of the only systematic , quantitative studies of the impact of physician-nurse relationships on nurse retention painted a much more sobering picture . The principal investigator on the study , which was published in the American Journal of Nursing , was Alan H. Rosenstein , a physician and vice president and medical director of the VHA 's West Coast hospitals . He and his coinvestigators sent out surveys to RNs and MDs in the VHA , which runs a quarter of the community-owned hospitals in the United States and is the largest employer of RNs in the country . The survey was designed to determine how physicians and nurses in the VHA system " viewed nurse-physician relationships , disruptive physician behavior , the institutional response to such behavior , and how such behavior affected nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported on preliminary findings from the first 1,200 responses analyzed . Of these , 720 were from nurses and 173 from physicians from eighty-four different hospitals . // Respondents reported that nurse-physician relationships , which seemed less of an issue to physicians , were extremely important to nurses . Almost all nurses had experienced or witnessed some form of " disruptive physician behavior , " which included screaming , berating of colleagues or patients , use of abusive language , and other instances of disrespect or condescension toward nurse colleagues . Nurses believed that disruptive physician behavior had a serious impact on morale and nurse retention . Many respondents cited examples of nurses who had , because of such problems , left a hospital or asked to be switched from a unit or shift because of them . Nurses also felt that physicians did not give them enough respect or understand the impact of their behavior . Most nurses stated that their institution did not deal effectively with the problem . // The psychologist Larry Harmon is the codirector of the Physicians ' Development Program in Miami , which evaluates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care providers . Harmon defines " disruptive behavior " as " any behavior which results in diminishing team members ' ability to do their best work . " He classifies such behavior as verbal , physical , and indirect behavior. // " Disruptive verbal behavior , " Harmon explains , " includes sarcastic comments , snapping at others when frustrated , or talking down to people . Physical disruption occurs when doctors throw small objects when angry , raise their fists at someone , give someone the finger , or actually strike or assault someone . " Indirect disruptive behavior includes things like criticizing people behind their back , spreading rumors , or pouting or intentional selective ignoring . " For example , " Harmon says , " the physician wo n't talk to one particular nurse as a way of punishing him or her . " // This kind of behavior has become such a problem that , in its 2002 alert about the nursing shortage , the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations ( JCAHCO ) also raised the issue of nurse-physician relationships . " Incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unfortunately well known , even commonplace , " the report stated . It called for a voluntary policy of zero tolerance in the workplace and suggested that medical societies develop guidelines to deal with abusive physicians . // In Canada , the Status of Women Sector of the Quebec Federation of Nurses conducted research to ascertain the level of violence against nurses in Quebec . Nurses told of being humiliated , screamed at , and subjected to temper tantrums as well as physical abuse . Ninety percent of the union 's members said they 'd been " victims of at least one act of assault or aggression during their career . " Among abusers of nurses , doctors figured prominently . The number of incidents , the union said , indicated " that doctors can express their anger against their closest workers as they see fit . " // In my interviews with nurses , their most common complaints were that physicians do not understand what role nurses play in the health care system , misunderstand whom nurses serve , do not value the knowledge and skill that nurses have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborative , cooperative , collegial relationships between physicians and nurses are central to quality patient care . Most nurses feel that although nurses work closely with doctors and respect their training , skill , and expertise , doctors do not reciprocate. // In his study of the hospital workplace , the sociologist Daniel Chambliss recorded similar complaints . " If there is a single dominant theme of nurses ' complaints about their work , it is the lack of respect they feel , from laypersons , from coworkers , and especially from physicians . It is nearly universally felt and resented . ' The docs never listen to us , ' they say , ' you do n't get any recognition from doctors ' ; doctors do n't read the nurse 's notes in the patients ' chart , do n't ask her what she has seen or what she thinks , they do n't take her seriously . " Chambliss , who spent over ten years observing nurses and physicians interact , agreed with the nurses . The " daily evidence " of physician disregard , he wrote , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common the obvious disrespect is. " // When I was recently in Adelaide , Australia , a nurse manager of a cardiac unit related an illustrative incident . Because of the closure of an oncology service in the area , cardiac nurses were being asked to treat oncology patients at a cardiac unit that was being prepared to take on an extra load of cancer patients . The nurses were given a quick course to teach them how to deal with oncology patients . Before their hasty tutorial was even complete , an oncologist in the hospital admitted a patient to the unit . When the nurse manager told the physician that the RNs did n't yet know how to deal with chemotherapy drugs , and had not mastered the complexities of inserting needles into porta catheters ( devices that are surgically inserted into the subclavian vein to allow easier , and over time less painful , access for chemotherapy and blood tests ) , he became irate . No oncologist would ever imagine that a cardiologist could simply stroll in and replace him . Nonetheless , this physician insisted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Surely someone around here can manage this . You are nurses after all , " he fumed . // See One , Do One , Teach One // In medical schools , doctors in training are taught to do procedures through the process of " see one , do one , teach one . " That also seems to be the way novice physicians are taught to look down on nurses . Listen to John E. Heffner , MD , medical director of the Medical University of South Carolina , " complimenting " nurses in the introduction he wrote in 2002 to a brochure about nursing that the hospital distributed for Nurses Week : // " We physicians at MUSC have much to appreciate in working with our nursing staff . Nurses amplify by their extended bedside presence the value of our brief daily patient encounters . The expertise and personal touch of our nurses drive much of the community 's perception of our health care facilities . And the vigilance and judgment of our nurse permit us to travel to our daily duties yet still respond to any sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
