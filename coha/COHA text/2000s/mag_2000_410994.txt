Between three and six million dogs are put to sleep each year not for physical ailments or old age , but for bad behavior . Larry Lachman , Psy D. , plans to change all that with a revolutionary approach to animal therapy . // An exhausted Eunice Randal had just plopped onto her sofa , about to release a sigh of relief at the end of a hectic workday , when her new cat , Mumbles , laid claim to her lap . " I started petting him and , suddenly , he grabbed my arm with his teeth and claws , " says Randal , of Claremont , California . " He leapt up and bit me again and again , until my arm was streaked with blood . I can still see that glare in his eyes . " A few miles away , Joey , a Siberian Husky-German Shepherd mix , slumped in the back of his cage at the Irvine Animal Care Center . Abandoned by his original owner for jumping fences , Joey sank deeper into depression with each month of confinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost interest in people , toys , even food . " Physically , he was sound , but emotionally , it was like he was giving up , " says Bonnie Arita , a shelter volunteer who brought Joey home to restore his outlook on life . During his first week there , however , he urinated and defecated all over her house and refused to go near his food bowl . When I spoke with Eunice and Bonnie , I could hear the desperation in their voices . Both pet owners were stumped by their failure to ease the new arrivals into their loving families . All too often , unsuspecting animal lovers adopt a new pet , only to have it react violently or uncontrollably Far too many family dogs and cats are surrendered to animal shelters for biting , scratching , urinating in the house , barking , ignoring their owners ' commands and other problems . Each year , between three and six million dogs and cats are deemed unadoptable because of bad behavior and are euthanized , according to national animal shelter statistics . And up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing physically wrong with them-they are killed solely because of behavioral problems . Ironically this occurs at a time when , more than ever , dogs and cats are considered bona fide family members . Gone are the days of pets as mere protection against burglars or mice : Nearly 70% of the 80 million Americans who own pets say they give their dogs and cats as much attention as they do their children , according to national surveys . Half admit they even leave answering machine messages for their animals when they are away . Treating pets like family may partially explain why good pets go bad . It 's also how my personal form of therapy works to solve their problems . Having been an animal behavior therapist for 14 years , I am often sought out as a last resort to try to tame misbehaving animals before they are given away-or euthanized . I have adapted the same approach I 've used for more than 20 years to successfully counsel abused children , couples in marital therapy and chronically ill patients . Called Structural Family Therapy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though other behaviorists , especially those who belong to organizations such as the Animal Behavior Society or the Association of Pet Dog Trainers , are beginning to adopt these concepts for use with animals , as far as I know , I 'm the first to have fully developed a pet behavior program around this specific form of therapy Structural Family Therapy , first created by family therapist Salvador Minuchin , involves changing the organization of the family and the way members relate to each other . The program has been tested and validated in dozens of scientific studies , including one this year in the journal of Marriage and Family Counseling . The main premise is that once the hierarchy of the family group is transformed , the relationships of family members can be altered for the better . For example , I once treated a single father of two teenage daughters , the younger of which was chronically shoplifting and skipping school . It turned out that the father had unknowingly elevated the older daughter to the status of surrogate wife and mother , changing family dynamics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for attention . Only by restructuring the family , so that the father served as an authority figure above both his daughters in the group hierarchy , could I resolve the youngest daughter 's behavior . This sort of structural therapy can help families with pets . I have found that in pet households , a power hierarchy , with repeated patterns of relating to each other , underlies the functioning of the group . It sets the rules and boundaries for the family . The only effective way to correct improper pet behaviors is to make clear where the pet stands in relation to the rest of the family . Since half the animal behavior problems I see stem from a pet 's isolation , lack of nurturing or unclear emotional boundaries with their owners ( genetics and biological problems also play a role ) , the entire household must change the way they interact with their pet in order for the pet 's behavior to improve . Problems mostly occur when boundaries between a pet and its owner become too enmeshed or disengaged . By enmeshed , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inappropriate crossings of those lines-for example , when an owner responds to every little attention-getting action the pet performs , making the dog or cat believe that it 's in the driver 's seat . This often leads to acts of dominance , aggression and separation anxiety . A disengaged boundary , on the other hand , is inappropriately rigid , occurring when owners are too distant from their pets , fostering a feeling of lack of belonging and often leading to fear-induced aggression , barking or meowing , and urine spraying or marking . Photograph // My goal as an animal behaviorist is to identify owners who are too enmeshed with or disengaged from their pets and then to restructure their relationships , without violence or drastic measures , in order to eliminate problem behaviors . And you can do it , too , with a few simple steps . Try This At Home There are two main principles you should remember when attempting to overhaul your pet 's behavior. 1 ) Change the way you interact with your misbehaving dog or cat . Do not look at , talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dog or cat when it is in the act of misbehaving . If you do , you are rewarding the very misbehavior you seek to eliminate . 2 ) Notice good behavior whenever it occurs , no matter how fleeting , and then look at , talk to , pet , play and feed your dog or cat . It will learn very quickly what gets a paycheck and what gets a pink slip . By positively reinforcing good actions and not reinforcing the bad , your pet will misbehave less and behave more . Dogs and cats do n't have elephantine memories . To make them understand why you 're punishing them , you must catch them in the act of bad behavior , interrupt them right then and there , and redirect them to a preferred behavior . I call this my Startle-Wait S-Redirect-Reward approach . Remember : S-W R-R only works when you catch your dog or cat in the act . Otherwise , behavior modification techniques will be ineffective and may even create confusion . First , startle the pet in the act of a misdeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog is chewing your leather shoe . Alert it without touching it by shaking a soda can with pennies inside , squirting it in the rear end with a blast of water from a spray bottle , clapping your hands or yelling , " Stop ! " Wait a few minutes and redirect your pet to an acceptable replacement behavior . Lure your cat to its scratching post by dusting it with a little catnip , for example . Give the canine a chew toy . Finally , redirect your pet with praise or an edible treat once your cat starts clawing its scratching post and your dog starts chewing its toy Do this consistently and before long , your cat or dog will figure out that there is a better payoff for good behavior than for bad . After you 've separated the good behavior from the bad , the next-and harder-task is to change the emotional boundaries between you and your pet . Two of the most prevalent consequences of enmeshment and disengagement are separation anxiety , which can lead to destructive chewing and biting , and general anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has separation anxiety , you are likely too enmeshed with the pet . You may have to lay down the law and stop responding to all of its demands for attention . If your cat is house soiling , you 're probably too disengaged from it , and you may have to bridge your distance by spending more quality time together . Here 's how . Chewing , Barking and Biting People often develop separation anxiety disorder when they are worried about being distanced from their home or from members of their household . This may occur after a traumatic event , such as the death of a loved one , an illness , a relocation or a new job . Pets , too , suffer from separation anxiety disorder . Some go absolutely nuts whenever they are left home alone , regardless of whether the time apart from their owner is 10 minutes or 10 hours . They continuously bark or meow , frantically dig , or gnaw on their feet or other body parts . This is a difficult behavior to correct because it takes place only when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy-handed punishment techniques of ten recommended by traditional trainers only worsen the problem and elevate anxiety levels . The goal is to counter-condition your pet so that it now views your departure as a positive thing-or at least not a negative thing . Keeping in mind that each case has its unique concerns , here are my general guidelines for correcting the problem : * Have your veterinarian do a thorough medical exam to rule out a physical cause , such as overactive thyroid glands . * Keep your home arrivals and departures very low-key . * Ignore your pet 's demands for attention whenever you enter or leave the house . * Give attention to your pet only during moments when it is not actively seeking it . * Pick two days that you are home and ignore your pet for eight hours . This matches the time you normally are at work . During this eight-hour stretch , only feed or let your pet out to go to the bathroom . * The following week on your day off , do everything you normally do when you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pack a lunch , grab the car keys , but do not leave the house . Instead , stay inside and play with your dog . // * On your second day ofF , repeat the above preparation steps and then step out and come right back into the house . * For week three , start a daily habit of taking your dog on a vigorous 15-minute on-leash walk 30 minutes before you 're ready to go to work . Walk quickly and have your dog heel and sit every 30 paces . This makes your dog tired and ready for a nap . * Confine your dog or cat to one area of the house . * Provide your dog with six natural , sterilized bones , beef jerky , a clothing object with your scent and a buster food cube loaded with kibble 15 minutes before departure . Your dog will be engrossed in chewing while you make a quiet exit . Do the same with your cat , leaving catnip , treats , clothing or a tape recording of your voice . When you return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soiling , Marking and Spraying Another major emotional boundary problem occurs when a pet feels too isolated or disengaged from its owner . This is the most frequent basis for a cat not using the litter box or beginning to spray and mark the house with urine . Moving to a new home , bringing in new furniture or even visits by other people can incite some dogs and cats to soil the house . After ruling out a possible medical cause ( such as bladder infection , parasitic worms or Feline Urological Syndrome ) with your veterinarian , it 's a safe bet that a change in the surroundings has triggered this action . Here 's what works to stop this behavior . For cats : * Clean and scoop out the clumps of litter more often . If you do so every other day , then begin daily cleanings. * Increase the number of litter boxes and place them in separate rooms . * Change the type of litter . If you 're buying deodorized clay litter , switch to nondeodorized sand litter * Remove plastic liners from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make sure kitty litter boxes or places that you take a dog to do its business are in safe , quiet places . Dogs and cats deserve to use the bathroom in peace . * Confine your pet to a room while you 're away to prevent it from attacking former urine target areas in the house . * Cover previously soiled areas of the house with tin foil . * Say , " Off ! " if you catch the cat in the act of spraying or marking , and blast it with a squirt of water from a spray bottle . * Spend some quiet , cozy time each day with your pet to help reduce its overall anxiety levels . Use large amounts of catnip and food treats during these sessions. * Check with your veterinarian to see if a more nutritious diet will help . * Be patient . By following these steps consistently , you should be able to correct the pet 's behavior within eight to 12 weeks . Prevalent behavior problems can often be boiled down to issues of enmeshment and disengagement . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashing out at his owner Eunice out of fear of distance from her . Following my instructions , Eunice ignored Mumbles for a solid week . No eye contact . No conversation . Just routine care like feeding , watering and cleaning his litter box . We had to reduce the emotional enmeshment between the two . Slowly , Eunice increased her attention ; first , by saying " good , quiet " when Mumbles was relaxing and rewarding her with a food treat . Then she would spend 10 minutes twice a day playing with Mumbles . When the 10 minutes were up , she would stand up and walk away without a word . Only after a full month did she stroke his back , and that was just once a day After two months , Eunice felt safe enough to give Mumbles affection without fear of being attacked . Joey , on the other hand , was depressed because he had left the small confines of a shelter to join the energized Arita household , which already included a dog and several cats . Joey also had symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had to create closer emotional boundaries between him and his owner and make him feel like part of the family unit . It was vital that he felt like he belonged , but he needed to be eased in gradually During his first week in the Arita household , I instructed the family not to leave Joey alone . If Bonnie or her husband Derek could n't be home , they took Joey to a nearby doggie day care . After a week of no mishaps , Joey stayed in a room with bones and food when the Aritas were away At night , Joey was encouraged to sleep in the bedroom with the Aritas and the rest of the pets . This helped him feel more like a member of the pack . During the day , he was leashed during meetings with the cats and squirted with water if he got too close to them . In the hierarchy Joey needed to know he was on the bottom rang . Soothing the Savage Beast Once Joey knew his place , his lovable , playful personality emerged . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleefully plays hide-and-seek with the Aritas . " Joey is a wonderful , loving dog who follows us from room to room , " says Bonnie Arita . " All the pets get along so well . I 'm really glad that we brought Joey home . " Mumbles also underwent a severe personality change , thanks to family therapy . I 'm happy to report that he now naps quietly on the ottoman next to Eunice when she watches TV " It was as if I 'd reminded Mumbles , You will live here on my terms , ' " she says . " He is a much happier cat and I can walk around my own house and feel safe . " The cases of Mumbles and Joey illustrate that you can make drastic changes in dogs or cats that initially seem violent or anti-social . Since 1986 , when I first started using a family therapy approach in my consultations and classes , I 've had up to an 85% success rate with my canine patients and up to a 99% success rate with cats . Euthanization truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ith a little love , work and patience , you can transform ferocious felines and despondent dogs into friends of the family .
