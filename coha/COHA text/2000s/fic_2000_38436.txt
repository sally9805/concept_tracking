TE REAL REASON JOLIE-GRAY BOISSENEAU has come up to <p> New Orleans to stay with the Marshes on Esplanade Avenue-her father , Gray , calls them " your mother 's high-and-mighty relations " - is that nobody down in Grand Isle can stand her . The explanation is that simple . <p> It is the Depression , and though the Grand Isle Boisseneaus are by Esplanade Avenue standards just bougalie white trash , they eat from what later will be called Depression glass plates every day . They know nothing else . <p> In Grand Isle , near the mouth of the Mississippi , on the margins of civilization , nothing seems different from what it was before or will be afterward . No one there remembers the days , a quarter-century before , when the finest people came down from New Orleans , even sometimes from as far as St. Louis , in summer-white suits and batiste dresses , straw hats all around , to take their recreation , to drink mint juleps on verandas that have since disappeared-the days when Grand Isle was grand . <p> Jolie-Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for over two years . It is a whine that rises to a wheedle and then to a keen , with an undertone of ravening roar , like a waterfall in a deep cave . But there are neither caves nor waterfalls anywhere around , only the Delta , and cottonmouth moccasins sticking their heads up out of the river , pale-brown as too-milky coffee , and slithering s-shaped back down again . There are only dried grass , and parched dirt , and rusting Nehi signs on the road . <p> Several matters are involved , are-to put it one way-under Bertille Boisseneau 's skin , or-as she puts it-are " stuck in her craw . " Jolie-Gray involuntarily imagines her mother as a white leghorn pecking about in the straw , nipping up pieces of oyster shell . Jolie-Gray has nicknamed one of the best laying hens " Madame Sniffee , " because of her highstepping chicken hauteur , her seeming almost to flare her little beaknostrils when Jolie-Gray goes out back past the wire fence in her red rubber boots to strew corn for the flock . Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a feed sack . Jolie-Gray 's father had to get out the sheep-dip and the single-edged razor and surgically extract the string , with its little metal tag-end , from the soft pouch of skin at the base of the hen 's throat . <p> She deletes the memory of Madame Sniffee 's cut-open crop , and her father extracting that string , pulling it out , and out , and out , so many feet of it , an interminable snake of string , and she deletes that unsummoned imagining of her mother , who says she herself has something stuck in her craw . That picture just will not do . <p> Nonetheless , in Bertille Boisseneau 's acerbic and self-assured framing of matters , Jolie-Gray just does not listen to anyone . Bertille has said it again and again : Jolie-Gray seems to think she 's a star , as if she expects somebody to send her a telegram and a train ticket to Hollywood so she can plop her hand in the cement by that Chinese theater alongside Errol Flynn 's . <p> Jolie-Gray 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-when her mother 's voice swoops its long , buzzard-black arc in the air . She wants nothing more than her mother 's love . Her father 's is steady and sure , but her mother 's Jolie-Gray thinks hard and seriously about the matter . <p> She walks all the way to Saint Clothilde 's to pray about this , to do a more thorough examination of conscience before the Blessed Sacrament itself , exposed on the side altar for twenty-four hours . The blindingly white wafer is stuck up there-smack ! - in the gold , lollipop-shaped monstrance , sandwiched between little round windows , with all of its gold curlicues radiating . <p> Sister Felicitas has said-and she did go to college way up at the motherhouse and does know the facts of this-that the jewels embedded in those filigreed arms include seventeen actual pearls from the Sea of Japan , brought up by native divers , and eight genuine rubies dug out of the earth in Ceylon . Jolie-Gray wonders why there are seventeen pearls , not sixteen , not eighteen ; the rays of the monstrance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jolie-Gray imagines the church in deep night , after the pink neon sign at Aucoin 's Bar down the street is shut off , and the Gendrons ' porchlight , and the single bare bulb in the Comeauxs ' rear kitchen that sways every time someone walks on the rickety floor . Profound darkness . She tries to imagine the silence . She wonders if mice come out then , whether there might be scurrying sounds . She imagines a pearl popping out of the monstrance and Glittering across the floor . She can see the mouse rolling that pearl to its hole in the sacristy , invisible under the shelf where Father Matherne keeps the unconsecrated hosts . <p> Jolie-Gray puts on her silk bandanna with the cherry blossoms , the stamped picture so detailed that the pink flowers ' pistils and stamens look real , photographic . She bought this on a trip to New Orleans and has been saving it for some special time , she could not figure what . When she ties the knot under her chin , the blossoms clump up together and lose themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pew , in shadow . She begs for enlightenment . What is it she keeps doing to rile her mother so ? No answer comes . <p> One thick candle in its red glass cylinder burns near the monstrance . The light dances over the gold rays , and flickers , and almost seems to make a whooshing sound , like mystic wind . The lit candle is meant to direct all eyes to itself , to the fact that Jesus is here , and not in the tabernacle as He usually is . <p> For a split second , Jolie-Gray 's mind tells itself that the leaping , cavorting red light-there is a wind coming through the side door that leads to the priests ' yard-resembles Hell , perhaps seems to be coming from Hell . She crosses herself . That will not do , either . The gold-filigree doors of the empty tabernacle gape open . There is something eerie about this , and somehow obscene , as if Jesus-looking just like a pale Necco wafer-were naked there in the flesh , tiny as a pink King Cake baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jolie-Gray squashes that thought quickly and prays three Hail Marys for penance , and then seven more . Ten should do it . No wonder her mother says she is a horrid thing , she thinks . Where could such a thought come from but Hell itself ? <p> One Saturday afternoon , someone has left a pamphlet containing a novena to Saint Jude , patron saint of the impossible , on the dark , rubbed-silken wood of the pew she slips into . Jolie-Gray prays the whole nine days of the novena without fail-all three densely printed pages of the pamphlet-asking for enlightenment , but she never can figure out what it is that she keeps doing wrong . She decides-but only for now ; she 'll go back and re-try it-that perhaps understanding the thing is itself impossible . <p> So what is the job of Saint Jude , then , thinks Jolie-Gray ? To preside over Impasse ? She squints at the little flame over his head , like the curly topknot of a baby in some cartoon . She remembers the tiny back burner on the stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sets the coffee pot to warm while her mother sleeps , and the smell of the coffee grows denser , more chicoried , staler , all morning . She wonders whether Saint Jude , like the stove , had his head piped for natural gas . <p> The priest who came for the annual Mission had put almost everyone to sleep-the church was so hot , and he droned some long story about visiting the lepers at Carville . Almost everyone had tuned him out . Jolie-Gray , though , was enamored of one thing he 'd preached . He said : Saint Augustine held that miracles are not contrary to nature , just contrary to what we know of nature . <p> Did Saint Jude preside , then , over openings-up of what we know of nature , crocuses of possibility that had been there all the time but to which our human minds , like crabbed wet pink cerebral intestines , had been heretofore blind ? <p> The little girl in the mountains in France who regrew a leg that had been amputated by the wheels of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jolie-Gray had heard that it did , and had seen an artist 's rendition of the girl standing , radiant , two-legged , in a courtyard . But a starfish could do that . So clearly , then , what we knew of fish-nature might just be applied in the human sphere , and be called miracle . <p> She waggled her head as if to shake off the silly , irreverent thought . Other times when Jolie-Gray had done this-had had a thought so intense she became unaware there were others around her-her mother had seen her shake her head this way and been outraged . Jolie-Gray was , in her estimation , incalculably vain , and at that moment was-obviously ! - displaying her hair , which , inexplicably , considering that both parents ' hair was plain Cajun brown , danced in unruly corkscrews of strawberry blond . It sprang up the moment it dried after being washed , like small cool phosphorescent tongues of foxfire . <p> " As if ! " her mother would say , unprompted , at any time at all . " Always showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at schoolyou and your prissy straight A 's , everybody just making over you . So prideful ! " She rode that long i like a slick silver chute-the-chute . " Polishing up the whites of your saddle oxfords like you were going to be curtseying for the Pope ! Or . . . " She tried to think of a charge more extreme . " . . . getting canonized ! Cleaning the kitchen as if you were trying for some sort of prize-polish , polish , Miss Betty Crocker of Grand Islet " Her mother made a sound of disgust . " You make me sick , " she added , in case there was any doubt , seeming to choke on the string or the tag or the oyster shell and to threaten to upchuck . <p> When Bertille wrote to her cousin Lucette Thibodeaux Marsh , on Esplanade Avenue , she did not say these things . Instead , she wrote , licking the lead of her pencil and rehearsing the words out loud in a tone that she thought sounded genteel : " Jolie-Gray is fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she could stay with you to finish high school in the city , and I am sure that in return she could be of assistance to you with the children . " She misspelled fifteen and appreciate and assistance . <p> Lucette had been the third-prettiest girl in Grand Isle in her day . Bertille Boisseneau looked up from the note she was writing , in some surprise , blinking in the dust motes that danced in the overbright light through the window , realizing how quickly , in some ways , these nineteen years had passed . Lucette had left Grand Isle to marry the skinny optometrist she had met in the Maison Blanche department store when he fitted her for glasses . <p> Bertille remembered how glad she had been at first that Lucette , the beauty , was now going to have to wear glasses , and then the glaucous , glazed envy she 'd felt , that Lucette was-instead of becoming a bespectacled old maid-getting out of Grand Isle , and marrying someone she thought to be money and class . <p> Three years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glory , have a pretty wedding in springtime , with bridesmaids in mint-green organdy , Bertille had married Gray Boisseneau , son of Clement Boisseneau , who owned the gasoline station . Gray repaired small engines . He had a clear forehead and very brown eyes and big muscles that bulged in the sleeves of his work-shirts . <p> Within the year , Jolie-Gray was born . She became her father 's darling . Bertille found she was not fond of that . Her cousin Lucette , however , had been unable to conceive , and Bertille found that some small compensation . <p> One day when she came back from the doctor 's , Bertille told Gray that she had a heart condition and they should not be sleeping together . She was hanging up her coat when she said this , so he could not see her face . She said something about palpitations , and murmurs , and little green pills . Gray blinked mildly , gathered his brows in a furry rosette for a second , and acceded . The little green pills never did appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her wonder whether he had something else going on . Perhaps the barmaid from Aucoin 's , or the girl with the harelip who did the shop 's books . That would be just like him , she thought . <p> Just before Easter the year she moved away from Grand Isle , Lucette had showed Bertille a picture of herself with the doctor the day they got engaged , an overexposed snapshot taken in Audubon Park in New Orleans . Behind the pair was the lagoon , where a couple of paddleboats were docked . They almost seemed to rock in the water . On either side Spanish moss draped languidly from the live oaks ' low branches . <p> Had it been several decades later , the snapshot might have been in color , filled in with myriad shades of green . Instead , the picture was black , white , and gray . Lucette 's face and the optometrist's-his name was Lamberton Marsh-had their features flattened by the harsh sunlight . Lucette 's right hand tried to shade her eyes and seemed to fail . The optometrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joyce ( a man born twenty years before Lamberton Marsh ) , with a thin , bony face , hats that made him look thinner and bonier , spectacles thick as the bottoms of Courvoisier bottles . A maker of glasses so that other people might read , though no reader himself , Dr. Marsh did not know and would never know James Joyce , or that he resembled him almost as a twin . This Lamberton Marsh , standing next to Lucette in her pale cotton dress , peered out of the photograph in a sort of dazzlement , as if he were struck stock-still by something more than that bright sunlight . All around them the grass grew , in black and white . <p> Lucette and Lamberton Marsh finally had two babies , a boy and a girl , after going all the way to Minnesota to some clinic-What , Minnesota ? asked people ; what would they possibly have in Minnesota that we do n't have here ? - and taking some pills , then shots , and then giving up . Bertille heard the news and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told this made spitting sounds and said , " That 's what she gets , trusting those Yankee crook doctors . She gets nothing ! Rien ! " <p> Six months later , folded into Lucette and Lamberton 's Christmas card ( which had a Dalmatian in a stocking cap on the front and their names inside in gilt Old English lettering , printed by an actual printer 's shop ) , came a note with the news : Lucette was expecting . <p> She said she had prayed to Saint Jude , the patron saint of impossible causes . She said Saint Jude was the brother of Jesus and thus very special . <p> " What ! " said Bertille out loud , reading the back of the card in her living room , all alone . " The brother of Jesus ! " This was what Protestants said . Lucette must have met some Protestants up in Minnesota , was all she could think . Catholics called Mary " ever Virgin , " and so when the Bible said Jesus had brothers and sisters it really meant friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestants thought everything the Bible said was flat-out literal . <p> Bertille went on reading : It seemed , Lucette wrote , that Saint Jude had been neglected so long , all these centuries , with no one praying to him , because of his name , you see . His name was so much like Judas , the betrayer , that everyone shunned poor old Jude . So a couple of people-she did n't know where this had happened , but somewhere  --  prayed to him to make him feel good , and would n't you know but he did some spectacular miracles out of gratitude at being noticed . This made good human sense to Lucette , and she thought , Even in heaven we 'll be human . <p> Lucette said she was going to place an ad in the New Orleans TimesPicayune-humbly , no name attached-that said Thank You , Saint Jude and gave clear prayer-instructions so more people would know how to pray to him . The ad would have a picture of Saint Jude , with his little flame topknot , and Old English lettering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parentheses the price of the ad . It was the cost of two weeks ' groceries in Grand Isle , with gasoline for Gray 's truck thrown in . <p> Jolie-Gray knows none of this when , a full decade later , she comes upon the Saint Jude novena leaflet in the pew . She prays independently . Saint Jude is new to her . <p> When , months after that , Jolie-Gray leaves for the Marshes ' , she carries a black Gladstone bag that Bertille had rummaged for in the garage rafters . It is old and cracked , so Jolie-Gray has rubbed the leather with boot salve until it is soft and lustrous . Bertille passes by while JolieGray is sitting with her legs hanging over the knobby footboard of her bed , rubbing ointment into the dark leather . Bertille clicks her tongue ; she sighs a dramatic sigh ; she shakes her head side to side . There is no mistaking her dissatisfaction . This is precisely what she can not stand about Jolie-Gray : Nothing satisfies the ridiculous girl . She ca n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . It is a good thing Bertille does not know that Jolie-Gray has rubbed down the interior , too , and made several sachets to put into the bag to disperse the mold smell . The girl 's excesses are beyond reason . <p> Lucette Marsh is pleased to see what a fine , cheerful girl her sour cousin has produced . She will be a wonderful sitter for little Vincent and Cara Nell , and from the letter the girl sent , introducing herself with great politeness , Lucette has seen that she writes a fine Palmer hand , with seagull-wing r 's , and exquisitely looped capital W 's . Jolie-Gray will be a godsend to help the children with their homework . Furthermore , Bertille wrote in her own letter that the girl baked a fine pecan pie and made excellent gumbo . Bertille did not mention that she got very tired of hearing the neighbors ' compliments on Jolie-Gray 's skills , nor that she herself deemed the pie far too sweet and the gumbo so thick that she wanted to gag on it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Grand Isle can stand her , she is leaving out the neighbors , the nuns , and the girl 's father . Jolie-Gray knows this at some level , but it does not matter , really . Her own mother just does not love her . <p> Now it is the first week after the end of school . Summer started in April , and by late morning daily the heat rises wavery , whoofty , implacable , off the tall-oak-shaded avenue . <p> Before Jolie-Gray came to New Orleans , Vincent and Cara Nell were by late morning irritable and bored . But now Jolie-Gray takes them on streetcar rides all over town . The fare is only five cents . Lucette keeps a penny jar next to the Luzianne coffee-can of congealed bacon grease , there on the enamel-topped vitrine that stands next to the stove . The penny jar is always full . <p> On the olive-green trolley with its shiny , hard wooden seats , they can ride and ride . After they have transferred twice and ridden a couple of hours , they can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowball stand , buy three snowballs-strawberry , spearmint , and coconut . Cara Nell says , " Red , " and then Vincent says , " Green , " and then Jolie-Gray says , " Coconut . " Then they window-shop in the Oak Street stores , go to the library , stop at the wading pool . After this there is the endless trolley-ride back . The children come home happy , ready to go to bed early , before it is even dark . <p> Lucette feels relieved by Jolie-Gray 's able assistance , but also , now , faintly puzzled and useless . <p> Jolie-Gray seems not to tire of these travels . Whenever they pass a church , she and the children tiptoe into its coolness . She takes out a little white-lace handkerchief for herself and one for Cara Nell . They balance them carefully atop their heads , because God frowns on bareheaded women , or priests do , and then the three kneel in the shadows . <p> Jolie-Gray prays to Saint Jude that her mother might love her , that she might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been doing all this time to be so odious and unacceptable . Vincent , slipped down in the seat so that he is half-sitting on his neck , plays with a Mexican tricolored straw monkey-finger-trap that Jolie-Gray has bought him at Woolworth 's . Cara Nell draws a mustache on a pamphlet about Saint Therese of Lisieux , the tubercular Little Flower of the Carmelites , then adds a fat cigar . Its penciled smoke spirals heavenward through the printed shower of rose petals . <p> Lucette , in her fifth-wheelness , is beginning to think there is something sinister in the girl , that Bertille sent the girl here to make her unhappy . Jolie-Gray made crawfish etouffee the previous Sunday afternoon , and Dr. Marsh remarked on its smoothness , its perfectly seasoned savor . Lucette rearranged her shoulders , discomfited , and listened to her spine make cellophane crackling sounds . She did not like the tone of his voice . She looked at his brandy-bottle glasses and could not see where his eyes were focused . <p> One afternoon the thermometer on the porch reads a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high nineties . This is no day for a trolleyride . Lucette has gone in a taxicab to Pearl Rouilleaux 's salon , which the woman runs from the rear of her house , to have her hair chestnutrinsed and marcelled . Then she will have been driven , in a different cab , to the Fontainebleau Ladies ' Social Club , where there are dozens of ceiling fans , tall potted palm trees curving over the white-linened tables , bottomless vats of cracked ice for mint tea and shrimp cocktails , and shiny black maids , two to a table , waving gilt-flowered folding fans . <p> Jolie-Gray and the children sit in front of the big window fan in the kitchen and let the hot breeze hit their faces . They pretend to be cool , but really the sweat is just drying and cracking . Jolie-Gray teaches Vincent and Cara Nell to play bourree . There is the sound of the cards slapping down , slick against the enamel of the tabletop , the sound of the cards sliding into and out of the spreads in their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly by Jolie-Gray . Sighing sounds ; sounds as they slurp their tea , whose ice has melted completely away . No one talks . It is just too hot . <p> After an hour or so , Cara Nell begins rubbing her eyes . Within moments she falls asleep curled where she sits , on a soft chair she has carried into the kitchen . It barely fit through the door , and Lucette would likely be horrified to find it there , but the chair as well as the secret will be safe . Vincent lays his head gently , as if it were injured , on the cool edge of the enamel table and does not move . He rolls his eyes at Jolie-Gray like a silly dog . <p> " Do you want a nap , too ? " she asks . He shakes his head slowly , emphatically , no . He is playing at being a mute . He seems to have become a dog . They sit staring out through the fan 's rotating blades . In the street , they hear the tinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound flattens out and deforms as it twists through the fan blades . <p> " Do you want an Eskimo Pie , then ? " Jolie-Gray says . She can hear voices of children shaping themselves around the noise of the vendor 's bell . There are half a dozen children hidden behind the facades of these grand houses . Hot days , often no one comes outdoors at all until the silver tintinnabulation heralds the truck 's coming . Then they stand sighing , waiting in line without shoving-it is just too hot-staring at the somehow scary grin of Pierre , Pierre , the Polar Bear , the picture on the side of the truck . <p> Vincent , now a basset hound , nods his doggy head : Yes , oh , yes , doggy want Eskimo Pie . Vincent pants a dog-pant , his tongue hanging out pink and child-perfect , and drags himself toward the kitchen . <p> " Vincent ? " calls Jolie-Gray . " I am going to take a shower , OK ? I am so hot . " <p> She picks up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . The air scarcely moves . She says , " Whew ! " and puts the pan back into the drying rack . The air seems to have turned thick with the heat , as if summertime had been cooking down progressively , day after day , like a brown sugar caramelizing , until it has reached its limit and threatens to transform into something else-dangerous , poisonous-or to consume the pan , or to catch fire . <p> She turns to walk , barefoot , enjoying the feel of the smooth Esplanade Avenue waxy-wood floors , to the bathroom she and the children use . Lucette and her husband have their own bathroom , at the other end . Its water-lily wallpaper makes the room look-if not feel-green and cool as underwater , and it smells of Lucette 's loose face-powder . As she passes the little ceramic gas heater in the living room , she is astonished to remember winter 's existence at all : She remembers the little blue flames in the open gas heaters at home and how she used to watch them , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sleeping . <p> Cara Nell will sleep through . The house in the heat , with her father at work and her mother at the Fontainebleau Ladies ' Club , is quiet , and Cara Nell 's thick post-bourree sleep is impervious to the tinklings of Eskimo Eddies bell . <p> " Just eat your Eskimo Pie in the kitchen , please . Not in the living room . You know your mama , " says Jolie-Gray . <p> Vincent angles his head and gives her another basset-hound look ; even his ears seem to droop . Then he runs heavily , slowly , despite his little-boy lightness , as if he is fighting Jupiter gravity , toward the icecream man 's tinkling bell . Everything is moving so lugubriously today that Jolie-Gray is certain Eddie will wait . Surely the truck is trapped too in this tarry heat . <p> Jolie-Gray turns on the faucet in the big claw-footed bathtub . The pipes make a great deal of noise before they will release their water . A second 's lurch of brownish rust-water precedes the clear , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drain with the heel of her hand and jams the white rubber plug into the hole . <p> Outside , the bell has stopped jangling . Eddie is helping the children to Dixie cups , popsicles , Eskimo pies , taking their nickels and dimes . He is telling the children that he bribed the weatherman so he could have this good business today . They smile , but they do n't understand what he means , or that this is a joke . Adults always say odd things like this . <p> The bathroom is an ad hoc , awkward thing , an afterthought made of space stolen from adjacent rooms . It is shaped like a railroad car . The house was built , Lucette says , not long after the " War between the States . " It seems to Jolie-Gray that Lucette puts it this way to minimize the South 's loss , as if it were just a generalized skirmish , with various states throwing pots and pans and rolling pins , then everyone going home to cool their tempers . <p> Jolie-Gray unbuttons her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she ought to shut the two doors , one at each end of the railroad-car bathroom-Vincent will be back quickly-so she shuts first one , then the other . <p> Over the sound of the running water , she hears the front door close heavily . Outside , there is still the clamor of children 's voices . Jolie-Gray tugs the pink shower curtain with its fat gardenias around the ring overhead , to close it , and turns on the shower , spraying her hair just a little . She reaches for her shower cap on the wall peg and slips it over her head . Her springy hair fights the confinement . Some tendrils escape . <p> She climbs into the tub and pulls the curtain around herself . She feels the elastic of the shower cap biting into her forehead . She leans to turn the faucets to make the water hotter ; then she will have the further pleasure of cooling off afterward . <p> She feels music rising in her throat . The week before , she went with the senior Marshes to the opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Marsh had the tickets , and there was a dinner beforehand , so , Jolie-Gray took the trolley and met them there . Lucette had the colored girl who did the ironing stay with the children . Jolie-Gray does not know Italian , of course , so she is garbling made-up words into the shower and humming in between , but she has the pure , clear , joyous melody of the funeral march firmly in memory , and she is singing it : bum-bum , ba-pada bum bum , deedle ee bum-bum . <p> The near door bursts open , and she shrieks and grabs the shower curtain around herself . " Blam-blam-blam ! " shouts Vincent . He is an outlaw now-she can tell from the handkerchief he has across his mouth , like the outlaws in Saturday serials at the Paris Theatre-with a whitehandled silvery gun , and he is chasing another cowboy , in a silly straw hat , a boy from down the street . Clearly the ice cream has not lasted long in this heat . <p> " Vincent ! " says Jolie-Gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the semi-transparent curtain close around herself , and it sticks to her skin , half-outlining her form . " You and John Lloyd get out of herel My word ! " She composes her face , getting rid of the laugh , calculating whether there is any way she can recapture her dignity . " You do know better than this . " <p> Vincent , mischievous , knowing his advantage , aims his gun straight at her heart behind the pink curtain . " Blam ! " he shouts . " You are so so so dead ! " Then he careens out the other end of the bathroom , after the neighbor boy , slamming the door behind him . <p> Jolie-Gray sighs and climbs out , dripping a clear pool onto the black-and-white floor tile , and shuts the near door again , heavily , then climbs back into the tub . <p> The pleasure of the water is exquisite . She lets the heat seep into every pore , turning the white ceramic C handle totally off now . She soaks the fat sea-sponge with fruit-smelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is singing into the spray . Aida is marching right into the tomb , and the whole chorus 's voices uphold her . <p> Suddenly the door bursts open once more , and here come Vincent and John-Lloyd , yelling , shrieking , blubbering , wanting attention . " Oh , boys ! " Jolie-Gray says . " I am ashamed of you ! " They run out <p> the far door , and before she can even call after them , they are back in , through the near door . " You are going to wake up your sister , and then you 'll be sorry ! She 'll whine and tag after you ! Shame ! " <p> " Blammity-blam-blam ! " yells Vincent . This time he is the sheriff . He is wearing the star on the sweaty button-front shirt Lucette insists he wear-he must on no account go shirtless , like riffraff , despite the thermometer . John-Lloyd , by contrast , is shirtless : There 's nowhere to pin a star . <p> " No fa-a-a-irl " shouts Jolie-Gray . She is , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is quiet . But she does not trust this . It seems the enterprise of her shower is near-hopeless . She pulls off the cap and hangs it back on its peg with a sigh . She climbs out of the tub once more , careful not to slip and fall in the chain of lakes her drips have made on the tile . She closes the far door , then goes to the near door . <p> She peers out to make sure the boys are not sneaking up on her . As she leans into the four-in-the-afternoon sun of the bedroom , the light falls on her hair , fresh-sprung out of its shower cap , as if light had just been reinvented , falls on her body in such a way that any painter would stand breathless . A beaded drop gathers at her collarbone and rolls down , down , to the tip of her perfect , fresh , gravity-defying fifteen-yearold right breast , and quivers there . Her ribs beneath the thin skin pinked by the heat of the shower are outlined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her middle , and she wads it at her cleft , for some infinitesimal shred of protection or privacy in this invasion . <p> Then she sees him : Dr. Marsh , in his black suit and hat , standing next to the chaise Tongue with its bright peony-print slipcovers , staring . She has no doubt , despite the thick glasses , where his eyes are resting . In her shock , she involuntarily drops the towel . The skin of her thighs is white , and the hair at their tops that same strawberry hue , half-dried by the press of the towel and now springing up in the light . She tries to vanish back into the bathroom 's semi-shadow , half-slips in a puddle , catches herself on the doorjamb , says , " Oh ! " <p> Two seconds have passed . <p> She is staring directly at Dr. Marsh 's face , and he is staring directly at her naked body . Around the corner come John Lloyd and Vincent . The two boys stop dead , looking first at Jolie-Gray and then at Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oops , " in a tone that is the strangest Jolie-Gray has ever heard , delighted , terrified , wretched , flippant . John-Lloyd just stands looking straight at the tips of Jolie-Gray 's breasts . He can not understand why they are so different from his mother 's . <p> Five seconds have passed . <p> Dr. Marsh takes off his hat and holds it in front of him , at the height of the hang of his hands , for what reason Jolie-Gray , rooted to the spot , two seconds more , can not comprehend : It is as if he were honoring her , and still he stands staring . Is the stare bold ? Is it stunned ? Is it simply slow to react ? <p> She steps back into the bathroom and closes the door , saying nothing . She is shaking . The shower keeps pouring , splat-sounds on the porcelain tub , blat-sounds on the curtain . On the other side of the door , no one says anything . There is a sound of the floor creaking slightly-someone or everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tub 's edge this way , in silence . It is as if everyone had vaporized instantaneously . The shower keeps pouring , splat-blat , until finally Jolie-Gray notices and turns it off . <p> She puts her dress on and wipes the tile floor with the towel . She is telling herself stories : Dr. Marsh came home early because . . . because . . . She can not think of a reason , but there is a reason . Dr. Marsh was coming after the boys , with their noise , because he had seen Cara Nell sleeping . He did not know Jolie-Gray was in the shower . But then what ? And what ? <p> She wants the weather to have cooled off while she was in the bathroom , enough that she can put on three layers of clothing , be wrapped up , invisible . This has not happened . She has been charged with readying dinner this evening , so she puts one foot in front of the other and heads to the blood-smelling butcher 's for veal wrapped in white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys ? Where is Dr. Marsh ? Irrelevant . She must make dinner . Lucette is not home yet . Cara Nell sleeps like a drugged cat in the chair , curled up tight . <p> No one appears until six o'clock , and then they all appear simultaneously . Cara Nell wakes , unfurling slowly in amazement , her face wrinkled and sweaty and squashed . Lucette notices that the soft chair has been moved into the kitchen , but there is so much else at the forefront that the chair is no issue at all . <p> Jolie-Gray is perspiring and salty again from an hour of cooking . The green peppers that cling to the steak in its pan are cooked to the perfect softness Dr. and Mrs. Marsh are so fond of . She tries not to look at either of them , but she feels Dr. Marsh 's eyes , through their thick lenses , trying to catch hers . Is he trying to calm her or warn her , or what is he trying to do ? No one speaks . Gara Nell looks blinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his little soft pieces of green pepper , lining them up like a train on the rim of his plate . <p> Jolie-Gray says , " I have a headache , " and indeed she does . She thinks she may throw up . She goes to her room . On her prickly bedspread , she lies facedown . She does not cry . She does not know when she falls asleep , but she hears the door open and sits upright . It is almost dark , so it must be past nine . It is Lucette , and Jolie-Gray can tell from her face that she knows . But what does she know ? <p> " Joke-Gray , " says Lucette , her voice tight . " Vincent told me what happened . " <p> Jolie-Gray sits trying to gather her wits . " What happened , " she echoes . She blinks . She frowns . <p> " He said . . he was in the wrong , " Lucette says . She has this Grand Isle probity : Someone is always right , someone is always wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and his little friend ran through the bathroom . " <p> " Oh , ma'am , " says Jolie-Gray . " They 're just kids . Children . Please , do n't punish him . " <p> " But I understand that there is more , " Lucette says . <p> " Yes ma'am , " says Jolie-Gray docilely . She wonders if Lucette has similar categories for the doctor , if he too must be either in the right or in the wrong , and if he is in the right , whether that puts Jolie-Gray in the wrong . <p> " That Dr. Marsh had come home because of the power failure at the store , and that you came out of the bathroom stark naked and stood right in front of him . Displaying your body . Pushing your little pink titties at him . " <p> " No ma'am , " Jolie-Gray says . She hears her voice rising in pitch . She tries not to be rude . She flushes . " Who said that ? " she asks , and she knows instantly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , whole interaction . <p> " No one said that , " says Lucette . She is smoothing her dress , stand ing straight in the doorway , in shadow . " I 'm not stupid . " <p> " No ma'am , you 're not , " Jolie-Gray agrees . She feels as if something a weight , has let loose in her , that she is a balloon and will drift away ; up over Esplanade Avenue , all the way to the river , then follow the cur. rent into the Gulf , follow a fish that has swum all the way from Minnesota and will lose itself in the Caribbean , looking around in the green depths , its fishy mouth opening , shutting , and opening . Then she prays she will drift away like a balloon . <p> " What did you think you were doing ? " Lucette says . Jolie-Grad hears her mother 's edge in Lucette 's voice . " What the hell did you thinly you were doing ? " <p> Jolie-Gray feels a defense rise and pushes it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school is at stake . High school in New Orleans . Hey honor . She almost laughs at this last : How can she think she has honor to lose ? <p> " I thought I was closing the door , " Jolie-Gray says , mildly . " That ' . all , ma'am . " She pauses a moment . " I had no idea that Dr. Marsh would be . . . " she tries to think how to say it . " I had no idea Dr. Marsh was umm , home , or that I , umm , and then there he was , with . . . his eyes . . . . ' She trails off into stupid slack mumbling . Yes , there is no way to be right . <p> " Are you going to blame Dr. Marsh ? " Lucette demands , her voice shriller now . <p> " No ma'am , " says Jolie-Gray . " No ma'am . It all was an accident . " She flushes , with rage , with despair . That word all was so stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not enough anything to call it " all . " <p> She wants Vincent to explain it better , but poor little boy , he e only nine , he does not understand . She wants Dr. Marsh to exonerate her , but he will not , because someone must be right , and a clear explanation would make him wrong . But then , she thinks , that is not quite right either . He has the power here , and all he would have to do is to explain to Lucette . But perhaps it is not that simple . She remembers his eyes in the kitchen : exhorting her , pleading , colluding ? <p> " I certainly hope not , " says Lucette . Jolie-Gray tries to remember what she hopes not . " Well . " The word comes down hard , like a rock landing in soft grass : no damage , but definite impact . " Well . I suppose these last weeks have been a silly illusion for me , Jolie-Gray . I did trust you . " <p> " Yes ma'am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Before Jolie-Gray sees the back of Lucette 's hand ; it hits , with the hard little knuckles , the marcasite ring with its multiple , intricate onyx and diamond-chip surfaces , flat across Jolie-Gray 's mouth . She tastes blood with the tip of her tongue . Her eyes widen and well up . She tries not to cry . A subtler and more complex response seems called for . <p> " I can not imagine how I can avoid telling this to your mother , " Lucette says , exasperated . She is looking at the pale blue hydrangeas in the wallpaper , which are gray in the dusk . She is looking at Jolie-Gray 's Sunday hat on the hat stand . She is looking at her own hands and thinking that they are beginning to freckle , or age , or change somehow else . " It will break her heart . " <p> " Yes ma'am , " says Jolie-Gray , meaning not It will break her heart , because Jolie-Gray knows Bertille would be gladdened by this even though she would know Lucette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 expect you will tell her whatever you choose . <p> " I suppose if you were simply to vanish , I could tell her you ran away , without giving details of what happened here , " Lucette says . Jolie-Gray says , " Ma'am ? Vanish ? " <p> " You know the word , " Lucette says , her tones cane-syrupy with condescension . " Disappear . Poof . " <p> " Vanish , ma'am ? " <p> Lucette sighs at her denseness . " I can provide you with a minimal severance pay . . . oh , a generous severance. . . if you will leave tonight . " She looks out at the purpling sky and says , expansively , " Tomorrow morning , at the very latest , without ever showing your face again . " <p> " Go where , ma'am ? " says Jolie-Gray . She feels as if she has just been bodily picked up and thrown onto a boat going over the edge of the world . <p> " Anywhere , " Lucette says , vinegary as her cousin Bertille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dresser . She seems far too close . " Anywhere but here . Anywhere but within a severalmile circle of Esplanade Avenue . " She pauses a moment . " And a severalmile circle of Maison Blanche Optical . " <p> Jolie-Gray considers the map in her mind . Lucette would seem to be including all of New Orleans in these two interlocked circles . <p> Lucette goes on . " Furthermore , I must have your absolute promise that you will not go back to Grand Isle . I want no cock-and-bull stories about Dr. Marsh circulating , and certainly not in Grand Isle . " <p> " Oh , " says Jolie-Gray . " I have no stories about Dr. Marsh . There is nothing to tell . " Again , Jolie-Gray 's tongue flicks out to lick the little rivulet of salty , ferrous blood Lucette 's slap has drawn . She wishes for invisibility so that Lucette will not interpret her tongue 's poking at the split in her lip as criticism , chiding Lucette for her lack of control . It is just that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere to go in Grand Isle anyway . <p> Lucette observes to herself that the girl looks like a snake when she does this , and that it is well enough this happened early on . <p> Jolie-Gray sees herself in the triptych mirror behind Lucette . She notes with some surprise the incredulous lift of her forehead . She sees something like terror , or death . The idea that she might resemble a snake to Lucette-poisonous , powerful-does not occur to her . <p> The sound of the door shutting behind Lucette is heavy and hollow . The rest of the house seems so silent . An hour or so later , a small envelope slides under Jolie-Gray 's door . There are no sounds of footsteps , no floor-creakings , before or after this . The envelope is face-up and has , in Lucette 's prim , cursive hand , Jolie-Gray 's name written on it , so strangely : Miss Boisseneau , as if no distance from Jolie-Gray could possibly be enough . But then why should that surprise her ? Lucette has just told her plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not sleep . When the sky begins to lighten , to a periwinkle hue and then to lavender , she rises and packs her Gladstone bag . She strips the bed and folds the spread , neatly . She turns to look at the room and make sure she has changed the position of nothing ; she will leave everything as she found it , as if she had not ever been here . She closes her eyes for a moment and feels her lids cool over eyes that are heated by sleeplessness . She drops the sheets into the laundry bin on the back porch as she passes , and she tiptoes down the back stairs . <p> It is pleasant and cool , walking out in the morning , but she has no idea where she is going . She has Lucette 's envelope , and she has opened it and seen that indeed there is a substantial amount of money there . The feeling that seems to radiate from the soft bills is peculiar : It is as if no amount of money is too great for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , just as no distance from her is sufficient . <p> She walks for miles as the sky brightens . She stops at the Cafe Du Monde . She has been here before , with the Marshes , on a Sunday morning after church . She orders a cup of the chicory coffee , by reputation so strong that it could dissolve her spoon . She scoops several mounds of white sugar into the dark drink , and somehow she is surprised when she pulls the spoon out still intact . <p> The place 's theatrical feel is romantic to her in the desolation of the moment . She imagines herself as an actress , and the lights around the mirrors that line the walls as bulbs in this actress 's dressing room . Then she thinks : 1 suppose 1 am embarking on a new role . <p> Then she thinks : I can not be doing this . <p> And she thinks : But 1 am doing this . <p> Once again she thinks : Saint Jude , patron of all things impossible , be with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Be with me . " <p> She looks at the other patrons of the cafe . There is a Baggy-faced overly made-up older woman with brilliant red hair who has clearly been up all night . The smile on her lips is defiantly cheerful , but her eyes are the saddest Jolie-Gray has ever seen . A whore , she thinks . She is surprised at her own thoughts . The woman looks as if she ought to have been-perhaps was-painted by a French artist visiting New Orleans several decades earlier . <p> Something impels her to go over and sit by the woman . The woman turns squeakily on her stool and scowls at her as if she is an irritant . Jolie-Gray has anticipated this . She smiles at the woman , says nothing . No rejection by anyone else today has the power to hurt her . She is past that . <p> Jolie-Gray swivels to look out at the morning . She breathes it in : pink light , the air of the cafe heady with chicory-coffee aroma , an aura of promise . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already starting to bleach out with its brilliant light . She knows she must move along but feels she should say something to this woman . She does n't know what . " You know , it will be fine , " Jolie-Gray says , smiling . <p> The woman breaks down into sudden dry , racking sobs . <p> Jolie-Gray thinks , What now ? She gives the woman a capacious white paper napkin , and the woman puts her face into it . " Nothing is impossible , " Jolie-Gray says . She thinks , Why did 1 say that <p> The red-haired woman clears her throat . " Honey , " she says in a gravelly , throaty voice , world-weary , smoke-worn . The tone is unreadable , but Jolie-Gray braces to be told to go to Hell . " Oh , honey , thank you , " the woman says . Jolie-Gray can see into her eyes , see back fifty years to a girl her own age wearing a white batiste dress and three petticoats , twirling a parasol in Jackson Square , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate red , and the broad moire sash of her dress a bright pink . This surprises and unnerves her . <p> " Have a really nice day , " Jolie-Gray says as she leaves , and the woman waves with the big napkin . <p> As she walks , she prays the memorized prayers to Saint Jude , and then adds her own free-form petitions , which swirl in the air like the trail of a biplane she once saw at Pontchartrain Beach , doing tricks high above the sand . All she really has wanted , has typically asked of Saint Jude , is her mother 's love , to please her mother-this would fill some gaping hole in her heart-but today she needs an answer regarding what she must do next . Apparently she is truly as odious as Bertille had thought early on . She has failed at the Marshes ' , too . But she has just told the old whore there is nothing impossible . Does she believe it ? <p> She walks all the way to Canal Street , then past it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand brass-bedecked canopy hanging over the sidewalk . She stands gawking at it . Though she has been up for hours , her face still in some way feels unopened , a morning face . The wiry uniformed doorman looks askance at her . She continues to stare . The doorman comes down the steps , slowly , one at a time , as if to give her time to run away . He looks at her up close , as if she could not see him . <p> " What you lookin ' for , girl ? " says the doorman . And then he answers himself . " Work ? Girl , you lookin ' for work ? Mr. Conigliari , he 's looking for housekeepers . " <p> Jolie-Gray blinks at him . She looks at the gold epaulets on his jacket . She looks at his fingernails , neat-clipped but deep-ridged and stained with tobacco . " Work , " she repeats flatly . " Yes . Work . " <p> He points her into the red-carpeted lobby . Then he half-apologizes , " Ai n't nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back . . . . Oh-oh ! There ! Yoo-hoo , Miz Vida-Jeanne . This young lady here might be just what you need . " <p> The older woman looks at Jolie-Gray in some disbelief . " Today ? " she asks , and her tone is as if they were picking up a conversation suspended some time ago , as if Jolie-Gray had applied and been approved and shown up in the nick of time . <p> " I can do this , " says Jolie-Gray . " Yes ma'am . I can . " <p> So she sets her Gladstone bag at the back of a linen closet , beside piles of towels , and cleans rooms at the Roosevelt , in a time when it is so difficult to get work that people are sleeping in alleys . <p> She wears a black uniform with a neat waistband and a white cutwork apron . She wears a little lace cap . She rents a room on Carondelet Street , three stories up , so that the urine and garbage smells from the alley diffuse and diminish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radius Lucette has proscribed-the Maison Blanche building is not eight blocks away , across Canal Street-but this is the best she can manage , and Saint Jude has set this gift down plop in her lap . She begs Saint Jude 's understanding of her disobedience of Lucette 's order . But then , she reasons , he does not reciprocally expect the impossible from her . <p> She works for three years at the Roosevelt , stopping each day at the Jesuit church with its soaring Gothic-arch ceilings and fragrant banks of beeswax candles , unfolding her handkerchief on her head , praying to Saint Jude . She tries not to worry . She prays for her mother . She prays for her father . She prays for Lucette and Dr. Marsh and for their children . She sends money home to Grand Isle each month , with no return address on the envelope . <p> She wonders about Vincent and Gara Nell . She wishes she could send them something , a nice toy , a letter , but is pained thinking that Lucette would be outraged even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that look he wore when he tried to catch her eye . She does not know that her father is very ill , soon to die , and grieves for her . She does not know that her mother is angry and envious that Gray cares for his daughter so much , even if he does not mention it often . <p> She never crosses paths with Dr. Marsh , despite the proximity of their workplaces . She credits Saint Jude with this favor . Once she sees a man who holds his shoulders like Dr. Marsh , from a distance , and she steps into a jewelry store till the man is safely past . The salesclerk smiles indulgently at her . Clearly she is not shopping for diamonds , wearing a Roosevelt Hotel maid 's uniform . <p> She makes the hotel 's beds tightly-no one can fold a sheet-corner as neatly as she can-and she polishes mirrors and marble dresser-tops and bathroom fixtures and tile till they shine . <p> One day a businessman visiting from the North tells her with a grandfatherly smile that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she is a lovely girl , if she ever knew it . She encounters him at midday three times during the week when she is airing his room and dusting the glass on the dresser . <p> She takes his suits to be cleaned , as she is supposed to , and runs the sweeper in his room , as she is supposed to . She writes directions to the Cabildo and Jean Lafitte 's Blacksmith Shop so the man can go see them . She tells him where he can buy fine , comfortable Florsheim walking shoes , and which vendors have the best selection of postcards , and the name of a little store where he can find teacups and saucers that picture St. Louis Cathedral to bring home to his wife , and dancing donkey toys on plastic stands that say " Souvenir of the Vieux Carre " to bring home to his grandchildren , and boxes of creamy pecan pralines for his associates and neighbors . <p> When he checks out of the hotel , the man leaves her a tip in an envelope at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week 's wages . Miss Vida-Jeanne insists upon opening the envelope in front of JolieGray before she gives it to her . Jolie-Gray does not object , but she does not understand the asymmetrical swoop of concern on Miss VidaJeanne 's brow . " Thank you for your services , " says the note . " You are a lovely girl . " Miss Vida-Jeanne reads it aloud in a terrible voice . She scowls at Jolie-Gray . <p> " I told him where he could get a tea set that has the cathedral on it , " Jolie-Gray says . " You know , that little shop the Italian lady runs ? The teapot has all of Jackson Square painted on its side , and gold all around the rims . " She pauses . " They 're fluted , " she adds , with her eyebrows raised in delight , thinking how much the gentleman 's wife will be pleased by the gift . <p> Miss Vida-Jeanne frowns at her , furious . Jolie-Gray has seen this scowl before , in both Bertille and Lucette . Three years has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has been mortifying her flesh , fasting , as she has learned the saints did . She has read in a pamphlet at church that there is a woman far across the ocean in a small peasant village in Schleswig-Holstein who lives-today ! in the modern world ! - on the Eucharist alone . The front of the pamphlet , an artist 's sketch , shows the young woman aglow with holiness . Jolie-Gray does not want to be foolish , or self-important , so she tries only for moderate self-abnegation . <p> She tries to eat as little as possible . Every morning she has coffee and dry Falkenstine 's French bread . Every afternoon , on her break , she gets a dish of stewed okra from the hotel kitchen . It is overcooked and viscous , and she seasons it with salt and vinegar . On Sunday afternoons , when she can get a single alligator pear from the produce stand of the one-armed Italian at the French Market , she cuts it in half ceremonially and removes the smooth globe of a pit , pours in oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skin healthy , as Miss VidaJeanne instructs-and eats that instead , scooping a tiny saltcellar spoon with delight into the delicate flesh . <p> Every evening , in her room , she drinks a cut-glass tumbler of fig wine that she buys , a few bottles every once in a while , from a lady on Marigny Street . Then she drinks another glass , says her rosary , and goes to sleep . The next day she has coffee and bread in the morning , eats her bowl of okra in the afternoon , and at night drinks two , sometimes three , glasses of fig wine . It becomes a routine , maybe even a ritual . Sunday afternoons , the alligator pear . <p> One morning-it is Sunday , and a summer morning hot as the one on the day Lucette ejected her-she wakes early and goes walking . It is not long after Miss Vida-Jeanne has given her the warning look . A bit later she will go to church , then she will work in the afternoon , so she wears her uniform , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks without aim , but she finds herself once again at the Cafe Du Monde . She enters and orders a heavy white mug of coffee and a basket of powdery-sweet , feather-light beignets , an exception , a Sabbath extravagance . She sits down and picks up a beignet and involuntarily sneezes , scattering powdered confectioners ' sugar all over her fresh black skirt . She exclaims in dismay . <p> " Oh , honey , it will be fine , " says a gravelly voice beside her . She turns to look . Though the woman is no longer dyeing her hair , JolieGray recognizes her as the old whore . Her white hair is tied back into a modest chignon in a net , as if she has finally acknowledged her age , her mortality . Jolie-Gray wants to ask her something . <p> Instead the woman leans to her and says , as if in answer to something unasked , " Honey . " She stops dead on that , like a heavy horse stopping . " Honey , " she says again . " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you can live without it . " <p> Jolie-Gray blinks and says , " Well . " She wants to say Thank you , but she can not . She is thinking of Saint Jude : Is something impossible , then ? <p> The woman nods her head yes . Jolie-Gray wants to believe she is responding not to the unasked question but to something inside her own head . <p> " I would like you to meet my friend Lalo , " the woman suddenly says brightly , cocking her head . " Lalo owns a ship . " <p> Jolie-Gray looks across the woman . Beyond her sits a young man with the look of a sailor about him . He is sinewy , jaunty , dark . <p> " How do you do ? " Lalo says , leaning across the old whore . Then he says his name : " Lalo DiBello Merleau . Of DiBello Merleau . DBM Transport and Shipping . " <p> He hands her a business card . The ink is a midnight blue . The card pictures a grand stylized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly bawd is still practicing her <p> trade , and whether this young man is a customer . <p> " No , she 's retired , " says Lalo , as if in response . Jolie-Gray has said nothing . " A couple of years now . " Jolie-Gray wonders if her head has become like glass . " Would you like to see my ship ? " he says . <p> Jolie-Gray says , politely , " I really had better eat my beignets before they cool . They 're so nice when they 're warm . " <p> " I can wait , " Lalo says . He sits on his stool with his arms crossed . He is the epitome of patience . The sleeves of his striped , sailorly-looking T-shirt are rolled , and his sun-browned arms seem to remind Jolie-Gray of someone else 's . His white pants are spotless . <p> " I can vouch for him , " says the old whore . " He 's a good boy . " She turns to pat him on the shoulder with an arthritic hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beignets . Then she drinks down her coffee and watches the sky growing pinker , then bluer . The coffee seems not to be cooling , and so she must drink in small sips . <p> Lalo sits with his arms crossed , smiling out into the day . Then he turns to her . " It 's time , " he says . <p> She has a strange moment . Who is this fellow : Death ? The grim reaper in sailor garb ? This is far too theatrical , but then she has not lived long enough to know that life out-theaters theater , that the stage can only aspire to the drama of daily life . Her eyes run up and down the backstage-style lightbulbs that line the cafe 's myriad mirrors . So is this a play she has been cast in , then ? <p> " No , " he says . " I 'm here to take you to see my ship . " <p> " So you really . . . " <p> " I really , " he says . And he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a mile away . They walk together to it . Jolie-Gray feels light . She is carrying only her purse , a small linen bag with eighty cents in itseven dimes , two nickels-and her ruffled white maid 's apron . She swings it slightly as they walk . She does not understand this airiness . It is as if eating the beignets has lightened her . <p> The ship is a freighter . It carries bananas . They have been unloaded now , but the smell of banana oil is heavy , pervasive , palpable , filling the air all around the ship , hovering over the wharf . Lalo takes her arm and helps her to mount the gangplank , then steps up behind her . <p> " We sail at eleven , " he says . " I expect you will want to come . " <p> " What ? " she says , not understanding . <p> " No time for a layover , " he says . " We are heading for Guayaquil . " <p> " I have mass at eleven , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Not today , " Lalo DiBello Merleau says , with assurance . There is nothing sinister in him . <p> " That 's true ? " Jolie-Gray asks . " And you do own this ship ? " <p> " Own this ship and five more , " Lalo says . " And I know how to run them . My father owned them , quite a number of years , and he died , and now they are mine . Would you be so gracious as to be my guest ? You will have your own stateroom . If you should find Guayaquil not to your liking , you may certainly return right away . " <p> " Oh , " Jolie-Gray says . She trusts him . She suspects this is Saint Jude 's answer to a question she did n't ask . " Then perhaps I will . Well . I will . " <p> The ship dawdles in its channel , idled again and again by river traffic , until it is night ; and then they are fully underway . As the pilot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark , heading to the Gulf , Jolie-Gray stands at the prow . Overhead there are minuscule , myriad stars , but the sky is as black as it ever might be . <p> Looking across the water , above the levee , toward the little town , Jolie-Gray can not see the pink light of the neon-script sign on Dubois Aucoin 's bar , though it is early enough that the neon is still lit . She can not see the raw light of the swinging bare bulb in Leona-Rae Comeaux 's kitchen . She can not see the flickering red-glassed candle next to the tabernacle at Saint Clothilde 's . <p> In the silence , as the giant ship noiselessly cuts through the water , she does not hear a pearl pop from the monstrance and roll down the aisle , or the tiny feet of the mouse that might be chasing it . <p> She takes it all in-the silence , the darkness-and she thinks : This is impossible . She thinks of Saint Jude and his tiny fire topknot . She laughs quietly to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And suddenly she feels a flush of warmth , as when she has had two glasses of fig wine from the lady who makes it in her kitchen on Marigny Street . The flush rises from her chest to her throat , to her brain , to her hair , and she hears a small whoosh , an igniting , as when a gas burner is lit . Something in her senses that this has to do with the cumulative effect of all that fig wine , those hundreds of nights of it , as if she were a sponge cake soaked through with it . <p> She lifts her hands to her hair , and indeed , she is on fire . She knows as well that the flame itself is , on the one hand , all that envy-Bertille 's , Lucette 's , Miss Vida-Jeanne's-stored up in her tissues and still growing , now independent of her , in her absence ; on the other hand , it is the source of her life . <p> The warmth is quite pleasant . It spreads to her shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she were on display , though no one sees her . The effulgence of all this cool flame-for it is cool , though it feels like a flushing warmth to her , inside of it-lights the whole foredeck . She stands straight . She feels the breeze pouring over her . Should anyone see her , the sight would befuddle , astonish : a woman , entirely on fire . <p> Should Bertille see her daughter this way , she would once again click her tongue in disgust , make a ragged dry gag in her throat , at the showing-off . <p> Should Lucette or Miss Vida-Jeanne witness this , they would cluck undiluted repugnance . They would be certain , as well , that Lalo DiBello Merleau was extracting his pound of flesh as payment for the voyage to the equator-which pound , they would know very well . Yes , they would be certain . <p> Should Gray , whose heart is filling up like a little pink vat with Bertille 's sausage grease and spite , see his strawberry-blond daughter , once more before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Roosevelt , he would applaud . <p> The ship glides on , silently , through the dark channel . In his cabin , arms folded , Lalo DiBello Merleau , having finished his day 's log , sits with his feet up , his bare sun-brown feet out of his rubber-soled deck shoes , wiggling his toes in delight , proud and happy to be of use . <p> The mouse in the darkened Grand Isle church rolls the pearl toward its hole , or does not . <p> Jolie-Gray wonders momentarily whether this is an example of what Saint Augustine meant by his definition of miracles : If sponge cake on a silver tray carried by waiters at the Roosevelt ( she thinks , remembering that sight , observed from a corner of the dimly lit dining room ) can burn this way and not be consumed , might it not be that 1 can too ? She is asking Saint Jude for impossible answers . <p> On the prow of the ship , like a torch , Jolie-Gray lights the night . She goes on burning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil that suffuses every inch of the deck . She wiggles her fingers , from whose tips shoot blue flames . Out of her eye-corners she watches the fire flickering , dancing . She cranes her neck like a scout , like a swan , like a ship 's figurehead carved by a sculptor commissioned by queens or the Vatican , out toward Ecuador . <p>
