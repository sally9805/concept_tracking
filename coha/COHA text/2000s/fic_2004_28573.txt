Chapter One KATIE JAMES COASTED HER fingertips across the muscled chest before her . Warmth tingled through her arm , a drugging warmth more intoxicating than expensive champagne and moonlight kisses . Her lips parted on a wispy catch of breath as images of silk sheets , entwined bodies and slow , delicious caresses filled her mind . How could this man affect her so powerfully , almost magically ? How could he affect her at all when he 'd never spoken a word to her ? His face was beauty personified , yes , but that was n't enough to entrance her like this , to leave her weak and shaky every time she glanced at him . There had to be something more to him , something elemental . Something beyond physical beauty that lured her every feminine desire . At the moment , though , she could not think past his physique , and slowly , so slowly her gaze moved over him . He was granite-hard , his abdomen ridged with sinew , his shoulders wide and firm . All of this gave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly sensual . He belonged in the woods with raw , naked branches surrounding him . Yet he stood outside among a brilliant crimson and yellow drapery of azaleas , somehow the absolute essence of masculinity . " Mmm , " she sighed , her eyelids fluttering closed . Her hand dropped to her side . " If only you were real .... " But he was n't . He was formed entirely of smooth , gray stone - a beautiful statue , nothing more . This was one of the ironies of fate , she supposed , that the first man to ever truly captivate her belonged in a museum and not in her bed . Why was she surprised by her infatuation with a beautiful , silent , unreal man , anyway ? Having grown up with five older brothers , she knew just how annoying real men could be . They burped and scratched in public , cracked derogatory jokes , and somehow managed to charm the pants off women before losing interest and moving on to other conquests . Her stone warrior could not offend her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unattractive or too tall , because he was permanently mounted to the colored marble base that stood in her garden gallery . A marble base she now stood upon . Another sigh slipped past Katie 's lips , and she fought a deep , primitive urge to touch him again , to hold him , to discover some sort of comfort or acceptance she 'd never gained with the procession of men she dated . This is wrong . I should walk away . But she did n't . The cool Dallas breeze ruffled the tight constraints of her ponytail but did little to cool her ardor , and with each passing second the stone warrior 's stare unraveled the very fabric of her reservations . Finally , Katie gave in to her craving . She dragged her fingers across his jawbone , loving the slightly bearded texture that reminded her of a man just before his morning shave . She traced the curved outline of his ears and imagined what he would feel like had he been the flesh and blood man she so desired . Fiery heat rippled across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingertips wandered lower , caressing his neck . His shoulders . His chest . She even circled his small , puckered nipples . A soft moan of pleasure wafted to her ears , the timbre low , raspy and masculine . Katie jerked back in surprise . After a moment she relaxed , even experienced a twinge of disappointment when she realized her imagination was simply running wild . Again . Had n't she sometimes felt his breath upon her face when she drew close ? Hearing him moan was no more fantastical than that . Gravel crunched as a car meandered along her driveway . Katie jerked around and watched wide-eyed as a black sedan halted just in front of her dilapidated , Victorian-style mansion . Tendrils of mortification raced up her spine , heating her cheeks . She 'd been so lost in her scrutiny of the stone warrior , she 'd forgotten about prying eyes and midday sunlight . Just what had this intruder seen ? She scrambled from the dais . The moment her feet hit the soft grass , she counted to ten , using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisted the statue 's allure ; instead she 'd acted like a teenage girl kissing her favorite rock star 's poster . Well , no more , she thought , determination stiffening her spine . There will be no more touching the statue . In fact , there will be no more looking at him , and absolutely , positively no more thinking about him . She watched a handsome , familiar male emerge from the sedan . Never one to back down from conflict , she maneuvered around the bushes and flower beds of her " pleasure garden " - so dubbed by the previous owner because the entire enclosure was littered with naked sculptures similar to the warrior she was n't going to think about ever again - and marched to the driveway . " Damn it , Gray . What are you doing here ? " Her visitor grinned , not the least put out by her brusque tone . Above them , the sun breathed peacefully , its powerful rays illuminating his tall frame and wide shoulders with an orange gold halo . " You owe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Katie dug into her pocket , snatched out a quarter and tossed it to him . " I only cursed because you surprised the shi - " Thankfully , she stopped herself in time . " You startled me , okay . For God 's sake , call before coming over . " " I called . You did n't answer . You were supposed to be home . " " So you started to worry , " she said . For some reason , all of her brothers still thought of her as a delicate flower in need of twenty-four-hour , seven-days-a-week protection . So what that she was now six feet tall and in top physical condition . So what that she 'd attended numerous self-defense classes . Gray shrugged , sheepish . " Yeah . I started to worry . " " Did you consider I might have just stepped out ? " She flashed him an exasperated but loving grin . " Do n't answer that . Just tell me what you need . " " I wanted to see your newest acquisition . From out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added good-naturedly , motioning to the house with his chin . " Why are n't you painting or laying tile or doing something to fix the place up ? That 's your job , is n't it ? " At that moment , Katie 's tense muscles relaxed . Gray had n't seen her with the stone warrior . Otherwise he would have been cracking jokes at her expense instead of inquiring about her activities . " I worked on the upstairs bathroom all morning and needed some fresh air . " ( Continues ... )
