<p> Cathy Cox looks at a Diebold AccuVote TS machine and sees the future of voting . <p> Georgia 's secretary of state gushes over its high-tech features , which she says have significantly lowered the number of uncounted votes and the possibility of election fraud . <p> Ginny Howard looks at the same machine and sees the mechanism that will undo democracy . <p> Greedy corporations and power-hungry politicians will conspire to steal elections by manipulating results electronically , the retired math teacher from Smyrna believes . <p> In the chasm between Cox and Howard , a debate is growing over touch-screen voting . <p> There is no evidence that any American election has been manipulated through the use of electronic touch-screen voting machines since they were first used in 1996 . Yet as Cox 's employees prepare 28,000 machines for Georgia 's March 2 presidential primary , accusations that they can be rigged have put the state 's top election official on the defensive . <p> Computer experts at respected universities have sounded the alarm over the potential for high-tech chicanery . Grass-roots activists , leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly via the Web . Touch-screen-related legislation is pending in Congress and the General Assembly . <p> Some critics suspect the machines might have played a role in the surprise defeats in 2002 of two Democrats  --  Gov . Roy Barnes and U.S. Sen. Max Cleland . <p> Anyone who knows computers can wreak havoc in an election , they say . Cox and her allies say the possibility of tampering is low  --  certainly no higher than with paper ballots , optical scanners and lever machines . <p> " I have no doubt that a mediocre kind of computer scientist could probably wreak havoc on this machine if you let them play with it , take it home , hook it up to the Internet , attach a keyboard to it , " Cox said . " But that is not the real world of elections . " <p> The stakes are extraordinarily high . With a nationwide rush on to replace old punch card and lever machines , there are millions of dollars to be made by the companies that produce touch-screen machines . Cox 's political future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually  --  may hinge on the system 's success or failure . <p> Most importantly , the integrity of one of America 's most essential institutions is on the line . <p> Rep. John Lewis ( D-Ga. ) counts himself among the suspicious . The civil rights veteran is the co-sponsor of a bill to require the machines to verify voters ' choices on paper . <p> " The ballot is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democracy , " Lewis said . " And if that is threatened , we wo n't have much left . " <p> Swiftly adopted <p> Touch-screen voting came to Georgia largely because of the 2000 presidential vote count debacle in Florida . <p> Florida came under intense scrutiny over uncounted punch card ballots  --  the dimpled , hanging and pregnant chads that could n't be tallied  --  and other irregularities because the Bush-Gore margin was so narrow . Georgia had a higher percentage of uncounted votes , but Bush 's easy win here meant the state avoided embarrassment . Even so , Cox saw a problem and decided to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballots . <p> In 2002 , Congress passed legislation encouraging states to get rid of their punch card and lever machines by 2006 , essentially clearing the way for electronic machines . But Cox saw no reason to wait . <p> Diebold Election Systems won a $54 million contract to provide touch-screen machines for Georgia , which in 2002 became the first state in the nation to implement electronic voting statewide . Maryland is the only other state to use the machines exclusively . Officials say 50 million people will cast votes on touch-screen machines in other states . <p> The machines work much like the ATMs made by Diebold Election 's parent company . The voter inserts an access card , which has been programmed with the races for his precinct . The card activates a screen and the voter presses electronic squares containing a candidate 's name . After the voter reviews his choices and presses " cast ballot , " the card is ejected and can not be used again until it is reprogrammed . <p> At the end of an election , memory cards are removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county election offices . The results of federal and state elections are then transmitted to the secretary of state 's office , where they are tabulated electronically . <p> In the machines ' November 2002 Georgia debut , voters and officials reported some glitches , mostly frozen screens . Republican poll monitors reported that about 100 voters in 20 counties complained the machines did n't properly record their intentions  --  they tried to vote for GOP candidates but the machines highlighted the Democratic candidate instead . When the voters alerted poll workers , the machines were adjusted and the votes corrected . Officials said the problems were misaligned screens  --  not evidence of hacking . <p> Overall , the machines received rave reviews . In two subsequent University of Georgia telephone polls , people said they found the machines easy to use and generally trustworthy . <p> Still , something did n't feel right to Kevin Murray when he voted that day . The Atlanta computer technician described his vote as slipping into the " ether . " <p> " We 've been asked to make a leap of faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray said . Murray , Howard and Mark Sawyer , who develops music class curricula , formed the League Opposed to Virtual Elections . <p> Vulnerable to attack ? <p> In July , concerns about electronic voting were catapulted from Web conspiracy and technology industry sites to the front pages of major newspapers . <p> Avi Rubin , a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University , and Dan Wallach , a computer science professor at Rice University , issued a 24-page report asserting that touch-screen machines could be manipulated to produce bogus results . Rubin wrote that software developers , poll workers , voters and " even janitors " could access Diebold 's voting system for nefarious purposes . <p> The researchers concluded the system is vulnerable to attacks that use software programs designed to discreetly activate themselves and change election results . Also , Rubin said , blank smart cards could be bought and programmed by someone able to decipher the necessary computer language to make " homebrew " voter access cards . The privacy of the voting booth would allow someone to sneak in a stack of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rubin later revealed he held stock options for and served on the technical advisory board of VoteHere , a Diebold competitor that manufactures election software . He maintains the stock options were worthless and that he had n't had contact with the company for two years . But the disclosure gave his critics ammunition to discredit his report . <p> If Rubin 's report detailed the means by which votes could be altered , Ohio-based Diebold 's CEO provided what critics see as a motive . <p> In an invitation to a fund-raiser for President Bush , Walden O'Dell wrote , " I am committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year . " <p> O'Dell said later his comments had nothing to do with operations of his company 's Texas-based subsidiary , Diebold Elections Systems . But critics saw it as evidence of malicious intent on the part of a Bush supporter responsible for supplying a third of the world 's electronic voting machines . <p> Diebold is poised to capture much of the market , having nailed down Maryland 's statewide account as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 , voting machine revenues exceeded $47 million out of total company revenues of $570 million . <p> " Who would want to rig an election ? One would be , certainly , the major corporate players who have tens of billions at stake , " said Bev Harris , author of " Black Box Voting : Ballot Tampering in the 21st Century . " <p> Harris , a literary publicist who lives outside Seattle , has led the crusade against the voting machines . Her investigative work helped prompt the Rubin study and is often cited by touch-screen opponents . <p> " There are some people who are quite extremist who do have access to large amounts of money , " Harris said . " My theory has always been that the weak point in a voting system is inside access and the ability to buy inside access . " <p> Issue brewed on Web <p> Touch-screen opponents have alleged that Barnes ' and Cleland 's 2002 upset defeats are suspicious because of a last-minute fix to the machines . <p> The state had to apply " patches "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screens were freezing during tests . Patches are common in the computer world . But the state did n't have time to recertify the machines to make sure the fixes contained no malicious commands . The patches were tested after the election and found to be legitimate , Cox said . <p> Bobby Kahn , Barnes ' chief of staff and now the interim chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party , has found himself in the odd position of defending his boss 's loss . <p> " I would love to believe that Governor Barnes really won and that he lost because of a computer meltdown or a grand conspiracy , " Kahn has said . But the count was accurate , he said . <p> In an interview , Kahn said the last poll conducted before Election Day by Barnes ' pollsters showed the governor with a 5 percent edge . The polls underestimated the number of rural whites who turned out against Barnes , Kahn said . <p> Howard , the League Opposed to Virtual Elections co-founder , admitted " we do n't know " if the elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we do know is that every condition needed for fraud did exist . The question is not whether it has happened . The question is whether it can happen . " <p> Like others , Howard first learned about the controversy via the Internet . She was angry at America 's involvement in Iraq and sought information from alternative media sources . She was " horrified " by what she learned about the American government 's policies and actions . Howard said she was motivated by her 28-year-old son to act on her anger , and found others who felt the same way . <p> " What I came to feel is that our democracy is literally on the line . . . in a way that it never has been before , " Howard said . " The vote is our core way that the people have of establishing control over the government . " <p> Many critics of touch-screen voting are intimately familiar with computers . Andrew F. Seila , a management information systems professor at the University of Georgia for 26 years , said that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seila , who has signed an Internet petition seeking to have the machines print out a paper verification of the voter 's choices that goes into a ballot box and can be counted by election workers as the official vote . " If you 're more familiar with the system , you understand its insecurities , its problems . " <p> Opposition to electronic voting continues to rage on the Internet . Harris has a Web site ( blackboxvoting.com ) , and a site called Scoop in New Zealand  --  similar to the Drudge Report  --  has picked up on the controversy , as have countless Web logs . <p> Other sites  --  including conspiracyplanet.com  --  have regular features on touch-screen voting . The site also has features claiming the moon landing was a hoax . <p> Activist Richard Searcy of Voter Independence Project , a grass-roots group , said at a town hall meeting on electronic voting in Atlanta that " today 's conspiracy theorist is tomorrow 's sage . " <p> The audience of about 200 , some representing the Green , Libertarian , Constitution , Independence and Natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please <p> To many people , the solution seems simple . Consumers go to a store and are given a receipt listing what they purchased . So why ca n't voting machines produce a similar piece of paper the state can use to ensure the integrity of elections ? <p> Rep. Rush Holt ( D-N.J. ) has introduced legislation that would require electronic voting machines to produce a " voter-verified paper trail "  --  a receipt of a final ballot . The bill is pending in a House committee . The receipts would serve as the official tally in the event of a close race or a recount . State Sen. Tom Price ( R-Roswell ) has introduced a similar bill . <p> Lewis , whose skull was fractured by police during a civil rights march in Selma , Ala. , said : " It means a great deal to me , because I almost gave my life for all of our citizens to participate in the democratic process . Not just to get to vote , but to have all of the votes counted . " <p> Cox says printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eliminate . Election fraud has often centered on paper ballots that mysteriously disappeared , Cox said , or bogus ballots that were illegally " stuffed " in ballot boxes in favor of a particular candidate . <p> " It really adds nothing to the system , and the people who think it will do n't understand the history of voter fraud we 've had with paper , " she said . <p> Cox strongly defends electronic voting , calling Georgia 's voting machines " the best solution available . " <p> She points out that computers have been used to count votes for decades . " The big change is that the computer , instead of being squirreled away in the back room , has been put directly in front of the voter . And the perception of vulnerability has therefore skyrocketed . " <p> The machines dramatically reduced the number of undervotes , Cox said . In the 1998 U.S. Senate race , more than 88,600 votes  --  almost 5 percent of the total  --  were not counted . When the touch-screen machines were used in 2002 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 percent . <p> And Cox points out that the new machines are equipped with audio equipment that allows blind people to vote without assistance . <p> Watchdog gives OK <p> Cox has found an unlikely ally in Common Cause Georgia . The government watchdog has issued a position paper backing touch-screen voting . <p> " No system is perfect , " wrote Executive Director Bill Bozarth , " but we see nothing in the current Georgia implementation to warrant any consideration for going back to other voting systems . The level of collusion required to carry out vote stealing is so great as to render it extremely unlikely . The chance of a fraud occurring and subsequently going undetected is virtually zero . " <p> Bozarth , who worked for IBM for 30 years , said he spoke with touch-screen opponents . " The people really adamant about this are people in the political extremes who believe there is a conspiracy afoot , " he said . <p> In October , the Fulton County Elections Board sent Cox a letter that asked pointed questions about the security of Georgia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines . Harry MacDougald , a Republican board member , wrote the letter after hearing about Rubin 's report . <p> Cox wrote a six-page response explaining the procedures in place to ensure the machines can not be manipulated . <p> The Fulton board replied Dec. 1 , telling Cox she had alleviated members ' concerns . <p> " I feel reasonably comfortable , " MacDougald said recently . " There 's always a theoretical possibility of tampering . That can never be excluded , regardless of the voting technology . But the measures that were previously in place , with the new measures and technical fixes that are being made , bring the issue within a reasonable degree of security . " <p> Cox often talks about the machines to churches , civic clubs and chambers of commerce while traveling the state . <p> " I get good feedback about how much the voters liked these machines , " Cox said . " For all of our terrible standings on some educational lists . . . my experience is , the voters are very pleased that we did this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something progressive , and they liked it . " <p> Her critics are just as adamant . <p> " We 'll be vindicated , " said the League Opposed to Virtual Elections ' Sawyer . " There 's no question about it .
