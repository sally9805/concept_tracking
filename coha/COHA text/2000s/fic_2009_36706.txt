" Fix your skirt . It 's tucked under at the hem . " <p> Juliette Stanton sighed and shook out the ruffled bottom of the denim miniskirt she 'd borrowed from her freer , more eclectic sister , and adjusted the loose flowing cotton top hanging off one shoulder . " This is insanity at its finest . " She zipped her suitcase closed and turned back to face Gillian , her twin . " Tell me again why you spent your hard-earned savings so I could take a vacation . " Juliette loved her sister dearly but did n't want her worrying or pampering her just because she was going through a difficult time . <p> Juliette slipped the luggage tag into the compartment on the side of the suitcase , muttering as she packed and not giving Gillian a chance to answer . " Much as I appreciate the gesture , I do n't want a vacation . I do n't need a vacation . I simply need to get back into my life . " <p> Gillian laughed . " Exactly right . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going on this trip . " She placed her hands on her hips , wrinkling the cream-colored pantsuit she 'd borrowed from Juliette . The twins had traded outfits as part of an elaborate plan to elude the reporters and get Juliette to the airport unnoticed . <p> Though Juliette understood the need for the charade , she hated the deceit . She shot her sister a disgruntled look . " I 'm going on this trip because you cared enough to arrange it for me , " she said , her voice softening . <p> " And you have to admit , getting away from the tabloids and rumor mill has to hold a certain appeal , " Gillian added . <p> Knowing her sister was right , Juliette reached over and squeezed her tightly . <p> " You know I love you , too , " her sister said . <p> Juliette knew . If not for her twin 's solid support , getting through these past few weeks would have been impossible . Since the day Juliette had bolted from the church , the reporters had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's apartment in hopes of getting the scoop on the Runaway Bride . But no one outside of Gillian or the groom knew why Juliette had called off the wedding . <p> And no one would . At least not until she figured out how to protect her father and let him retire from the senate , his reputation and pride intact . At which point the press could have at Stuart Barnes and his shady dealings . <p> " So have you heard from the louse ? " Gillian grabbed a pillow and sat down . <p> Juliette shook her head , emotion clogging her throat . Although she 'd never say she 'd been in love with Stuart , what they 'd shared had been comfortable and secure . Too comfortable , she acknowledged now . <p> With hindsight she could see the reasons for her engagement . They were twofold and simple . Juliette adored her mother and father and idolized their loving relationship . They were wonderful parents who 'd managed to keep a family intact despite the fishbowl in which they lived . Juliette wanted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd believed she could share those things with Stuart , a childhood friend she thought she knew well . <p> And then there was the other reason she 'd gotten engaged  --  the one Juliette hated to admit , even to herself . While neither her mother nor her father had ever asked for her to sacrifice , she 'd always taken the expected road . Perhaps because Gillian had taken on the part of the wild child , Juliette , the older sister by a matter of minutes , had always seen her role as that of the good girl . So when Stuart set his sights on Juliette , she 'd fallen into the relationship without question . Because she 'd recently been hurt by a man more interested in her father 's name and connections than in her , Stuart who 'd always been a part of her life , seemed safe . And because her parents liked and trusted him , they 'd been thrilled and could claim " they knew Juliette and Stuart belonged together all along . " <p> But they had n't belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have seen the signs . Yet she 'd never questioned their relationship , not even their lukewarm sex life , which deep down she 'd blamed herself for . Certainly her previous painful affair had n't boosted her confidence . Perhaps she 'd known all along that if she questioned her decision , she 'd discover she 'd repeated her mistake . Stuart wanted leverage in achieving her father 's soon-to-be-vacant senate seat . Nothing more . Especially not Juliette Stanton , the woman . <p> " Earth to Juliette . " Gillian snapped her fingers . <p> She shook her head . " Sorry . Too much thinking going on . No , I have n't heard a word since our confrontation in the church . But what 's he going to say ? ' Thanks for keeping the press off my back so I can take your father 's place in November ' ? " <p> Gillian sniffed in disdain . " He could say , ' I 'm an ass . ' That would be a start . " <p> " I agree . And considering he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's trusting me to keep quiet about why I bolted . " Stuart was her father 's protTgT . His choice to succeed him . If Stuart 's shady dealings came to light , Juliette 's father , his decisions and choices would all be suspect , tainting the good he 'd accomplished during his tenure . <p> Gillian clenched her teeth . " He 's trusting your love for Dad . " <p> Juliette let out a harsh laugh . " He 's certainly not banking on my love for him . " Or what was left of it . <p> She 'd thought they shared caring and consideration based on their years of friendship . Even after scandal had hit the papers , accusing Stuart 's business partner , Congressman Haywood , of laundering Mob money through Coffee Connections , their import-export business , she 'd believed her fiancT 's denials . In this instance , she had n't shut her eyes to the truth , rather , like her father , she 'd believed in Stuart 's integrity . And since Stuart had n't been labeled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been retracted , she 'd trusted her instincts . <p> How wrong she 'd been . Again . She 'd caught Stuart red-handed , his business partner and the reputed Mob boss having a tOte-a-tOte in the church minutes before she and Stuart were to be married . <p> She faced her life and the lies at last , confronted him and walked out . And though her parents supported her decision and her need for privacy , she knew they too were waiting for an explanation . <p> Gillian let out a groan . " We both agree that this needs to be kept under wraps until you figure out a plan , but I do n't like the fact that Stuart 's let the press pin you with the Runaway Bride rap . " She picked up a videotape box containing the movie of the same name . " You might have similar hair  --  did I mention I love the curls ? " She flicked at one of Juliette 's long spirals with her fingers . " And since this is the last time I have to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fake out those reporters , I 'm eternally grateful . " <p> Juliette laughed . " Thanks . " She loved her new look , too . <p> She 'd secretly always envied her sister 's ability to thumb her nose at convention and just be herself , cameras and press be damned . Juliette hoped her new loose-flowing perm , like her free-spirited sister 's , would change both her appearance and outlook for her upcoming trip . If there was ever a time to let loose , this vacation would have to be it . <p> " Did you pick up those things for me at the mall ? " Juliette asked her twin . If her fiancT had been interested in planning a honeymoon instead of a political campaign and election , she 'd have the wardrobe basics ready to go . But Stuart had insisted they could n't get away . Now she knew why . <p> " Got ' em . I put them in the empty suitcase while you were on the phone earlier . And you 'd be so proud of how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obviously pleased with herself . <p> Juliette cringed . " I 'm sure I do n't want to know . It seems everyone 's been making sacrifices to accommodate me these days . " She hated the high maintenance perception that was the result of this nightmare . First her stylist had agreed to do spiral curls and a haircut at her house , not wanting his salon inundated by the press , and now her sister was running around like an undercover spy  --  and loving every minute . <p> " They 're not sacrifices , they 're favors . And we love you , so we do n't mind . But I hate that you 're stuck in the house and practically branded , you know ? " Gillian tapped her foot impatiently against the hardwood floor . " Damn , I wish we could leak this story . " She shook her head . " But we ca n't . " <p> " Not yet . Dad 's established a long tradition of serving this country . He 's well liked and respected . He has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll let him go out tainted by scandal . He does n't deserve it . " <p> Gillian nodded . " I agree . " <p> For their father 's sake , the secret had to stay secret a little longer . Juliette drew a deep breath . " I 'm ready . " <p> " Okay . " Gillian rose from her seat and grabbed for a bag . <p> " So let me get this plan straight . I drive your car dressed like you , while you sit in the passenger seat pretending to be me , " Juliette said . <p> " So far so good . " <p> " We drive past the reporters , to your apartment where the rest of the vultures are waiting , and pull into the secure underground garage . " <p> Gillian nodded . " Right . Where they have no access . " Her laugh bordered on giddy at the thought of outwitting the press . " They think you 're visiting me and to reinforce the impression , I , dressed as you , go up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before heading back inside . They wo n't be looking for us to go anywhere while we 're presumably hanging out together . " <p> " Meanwhile I slip into the back seat of Dad 's car , driven by his chauffeur , cover myself with a blanket and end up at the airport . " <p> " Exactly . And if anyone happens to see you , they 'll think you 're me . No one 's going to bother following me once I have no access to you . Voila ! You 're home free and on your way . " <p> Juliette stretched her arms out wide . " Ready to begin a glorious week of fun , sun and solitude . " <p> Her sister 's gaze darted from hers . " You got the first two right , " she muttered . <p> Juliette narrowed her eyes . She 'd grown up in the shadow of her daring , more adventurous twin and she knew Gillian better than she knew herself . The shifting eyeballs and muttering under her breath meant her sister was up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Juliette asked . <p> " Not a blessed thing . " Gillian glanced at her watch . " You do n't want to miss your flight . We need to get going . " <p> Juliette grabbed her suitcase . " Okay . And if I have n't said it before because I was too busy complaining , I am touched you 'd spend your savings on me  --  and I want to pay you back . " Although both girls had trust funds set up in their name from their grandmother 's will , neither lived off the interest or principal . Each chose to make their own way in the world , Juliette as a public relations consultant for a pharmaceutical company , Gillian as a teacher . <p> " It 's not a gift if you pay me , " her sister reminded her . " Consider this my broken wedding gift to you . " <p> Juliette squeezed her sister 's hand . " I 'm so lucky to have you . " <p> Gillian grinned . " Yeah , you are . " <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old cottage Juliette rented , where Gillian had parked her car . <p> " Promise me something ? " Gillian asked . " It 's private on the island and if we 've done this right , no cameras are following you , no press is around to ask questions . Let loose and be yourself , okay ? " <p> " You read my mind . " Juliette was n't surprised that the twin connection was at work again . She laughed , knowing she 'd already decided to take advantage of this time to be free and experiment with who Juliette Stanton really was . She never should have fought Gillian 's attempt to get her to take a vacation . She settled herself into the driver 's seat , put the key in the ignition and turned her wrist . <p> " So , " she said over the rumble of the car 's motor . " Let the adventure begin . " <p> One week after his initial visit , Doug Houston stood in the luxurious open-air lobby of Secret Fantasy 's main building waiting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guilt swamped him over the thought of this whole damned trip and the charade he 'd have to employ to get his story . Guilt was n't an emotion Doug was familiar with , especially when it came to getting the job done . But this job was too important to let something like unexpected feelings get in the way . <p> He was at this resort tracking down Juliette Stanton , Chicago 's Runaway Bride , so he could dig up dirt on her ex-fiancT . And therein lay the source of his guilt . He could console himself with the fact that he was n't out to dig up dirt on her and in that , at least , he had n't lied to Merrilee . <p> But Doug had a nagging feeling the reasons for Juliette 's run from the altar had everything to do with Doug 's recent troubles  --  and his journalist father had taught him never to ignore a burning gut . Treat it with antacids , maybe , but pay close attention . After the last fiasco , Doug damn well would . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
