<p> Doug Williams knows how recently demoted Patrick Ramsey feels . In his four years working for Joe Gibbs as a quarterback for the Redskins from 1986 to ' 89 he bounced from holding clipboards for Jay Schroeder and Mark Rypien to becoming most valuable player of Super Bowl XXII in Washington 's 42-10 victory over Denver in 1988 and on to a sad farewell a year later . <p> Demotions and promotions were part of life for Williams in his 11-year pro career , which began in Tampa Bay in 1978 and included stops in Oklahoma ( 1984 ) and Arizona ( 1985 ) of the U.S. Football League before signing with the Redskins as a backup in 1986 , when he threw one pass . <p> At 50 , Williams is now a personnel executive for the Buccaneers , with a successful head coaching run at Grambling and a brief assistant coaching stint at Navy on his rsum . His four years working for Gibbs included being an afterthought , surprise starter , MVP/star , replaced and displaced . <p> " Joe Gibbs is one guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win , " Williams said in a telephone interview . " He always told me he had to cut personal feelings from personnel decisions . Even when his decisions went against me , I found him an honorable guy . I came here from the USFL and was thankful for the opportunity . When I was n't playing , I still felt I was the best quarterback . But I dealt with the situation . I was humble by the way I came up . There were few black quarterbacks in the league and I had the chance to compete for playing time . That 's all you can ask . I considered it a privilege to play in the league . " <p> I had a similar conversation with Williams last season , when the roles were reversed and Ramsey took over for Mark Brunell . Williams 's view this time : " Brunell better play his rear end off ; Ramsey ought to take what happened and work at getting better . And if you ask for a trade , make sure you know someone wants you . Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wo n't let him sit forever , either . " <p> After last Sunday 's game , which the Redskins won against Chicago , 9-7 , Gibbs watchers left FedEx Field convinced he would replace Ramsey with Brunell for Monday night 's game in Dallas . Statements such as " Mark does n't make mistakes ; I 'm sure glad he 's back " and not saying Ramsey would start if healthy were hints enough . <p> Gibbs was wise to officially announce the switch last Monday . But he was wrong to name Ramsey the starter last January rather than keep the position open for a competition that Brunell would have won this summer . " It 's something I needed to do , " Gibbs explained , if not to the satisfaction of Ramsey and a growing number of fans becoming disenchanted with the coach . <p> I agree with Gibbs 's move to Brunell  --  as well as with my friend , the Ol ' Ball Coach , who used to say , " If one guy ca n't do it , try the other guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fans at FedEx Field for making so much noise Bears QB Kyle Orton had trouble getting off his plays . I call that behavior bush league . In similar situations at NFL stadiums , the QB should step back and wait for the noise to subside , or until the home team is hit with a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct . <p> Leave it to NCAA President Myles Brand to make a bad situation worse , announcing Division I basketball and football players at schools closed by Hurricane Katrina will have to sit out a year if they transfer to another college . Brand said some players planned to transfer together to a single college , a move he called " athletic looting . " <p> What ? Did he say " athletic looting ? " Get real . <p> " What an exaggeration , " said John Thompson , WTEM and TNT commentator , who used to regularly recruit in New Orleans during his 26 years of coaching basketball at Georgetown . " You want to protect the interest of the kids  --  not worry so much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player . After what these kids have been through , the NCAA ought to permit them to play anywhere , not punish them , and make judgments . " <p> Retired DeMatha coach Morgan Wootten , who like Thompson is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame , said a number of good high school basketball players affected " will lose the year and maybe their opportunity to play in college . " <p> " We had seven players over the years from New Orleans , " Thompson recalled . " A rich tradition there . Starting with Steve Martin now an executive with the NBA New Orleans Hornets . They all had old-fashioned values  --  good kids  --  strongly attached to the city and their high schools . The kids we had were smart and willing . " <p> * Disappointed the Caps and Peter Bondra did not find a way to make deal for Bondra to finish his career here . But team owner Ted Leonsis is committed to a youth movement . " We have 20 first-round picks in camp and we will go through growing pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger and we wo n't change our strategy , " Leonsis said , pointing to the overachieving Nationals and last season 's Wizards as models of success . <p> I like young , fast teams , but not growing pains . So how about signing some defensemen ? <p> * Did I really hear Nats GM Jim Bowden second-guessing Frank Robinson having Chad Cordero pitch to Atlanta 's Chipper Jones and Andruw Jones in the ninth inning last Sunday , when Cordero surrendered back-to-back home runs to both sluggers in a tough-to-take 9-7 loss ? Bowden 's done a good job , especially having to operate on MLB-mandated payroll of about $55 million . Robinson has done a terrific  --  if not perfect  --  job keeping these guys alive in the playoff chase , this late in September , and does not need to be second-guessed by his own front office . <p> If all eight groups seeking to buy the Nationals received " highly detailed " purchase agreements from MLB this week for around $450 million , how can Bud Selig and Co. complete the deal before the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the running ? Who is going to sign that lease for the new stadium if the mayor is in Greece ? If the Nats draw 2.7 million fans at RFK , will MLB open the books and show us where the money went ? It certainly did n't go for a starting pitcher . How much went to Peter the Great ? <p> * Soccer fans get cranky when I ask dumb questions , such as why is D.C. United  --  in the middle of a late run to repeat as MLS champion  --  flying 5,000 miles to Santiago , Chile , this week to meet Universidad Catolica in the quarterfinals Thursday of a competition called Copa Sudamericana ? <p> " I love these tournaments and think they are important for our league , players and fans , " explained United President Kevin Payne . " This is what we have to do if you 're going to be a player in an international sport . It will make us a better , more visible team . " <p> I 'll accept that , even with the 5,000-mile schlep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My Sudamericana : A Good Flight Spoiled , " will chronicle the tournament . <p> Have a comment or question ?
