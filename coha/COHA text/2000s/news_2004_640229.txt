<p> Accusations and assignment of blame flowed freely on Monday as lawyers in the trial of four former Qwest executives accused of fraud made their opening arguments . <p> Defense attorneys took turns blaming Qwest , its accountants , its auditors and even other defendants for contorting a 2001 deal between Qwest and the Arizona School Facilities Board to the point that it allegedly violated federal laws . <p> In contrast , federal prosecutors urged the jury to use common sense in understanding what they described as a simple deal gone awry . <p> ' We believe that the evidence will show that the defendants broke important rules about revenue recognition at Qwest Communications , and then that the defendants lied about what they had done , ' First Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Leone told the jury in front of a packed courtroom . ' It 's just that simple . ' <p> Opening arguments marked the beginning of the second week of the trial of Grant P. Graham , Bryan K. Treadway , Thomas W. Hall and John M. Walker . A grand jury indicted the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with a 2001 deal between Qwest and the Arizona School Facilities Board , or ASFB . <p> Federal prosecutors allege the four manipulated the deal so that it would appear Qwest sold $ 33.6 million of telecommunications gear to the ASFB and held it in a Qwest warehouse in Arizona . Thus , Qwest logged revenue from the sale in the second quarter of 2001 - helping it hit its quarterly goals - when it should have spread the revenue over several subsequent quarters . <p> But the deal , as it was reconfigured , did not adhere to seven accounting criteria needed for Qwest to log the $ 33.6 million right away , Leone said . <p> Among the counter arguments offered by defense counsel Monday : <p> Attorneys representing Graham and Hall depicted their clients as victims of Qwest 's efforts to avoid prosecution . Much of the government 's evidence are statements taken from the defendants by lawyers hired by Qwest to do an internal investigation , they said . Neither Hall nor Graham had counsel present during those interviews . <p> ' This is a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lawyer . ' This is not an endeavor by four gentlemen sitting around scheming how to break federal laws . ' <p> Some defendants pointed to former Qwest finance director Doug Hutchins as driving Qwest 's method of accounting for the deal . Hutchins , a former Qwest accountant who served as Graham 's assistant , is slated to testify in the trial . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him in connection with the ASFB deal , but the Justice Department granted him limited immunity . <p> Attorneys for Hall and Walker said their clients received no financial incentive to skew the deal . Walker received no sales commission , and the ASFB deal did not affect his bonus much , his attorneys said . He exercised none of his 18,000 Qwest stock options . <p> Hall 's bonus from the ASFB deal amounted to $ 888 and he has sold none of his Qwest stock , said his attorney , Jeff Springer . ' The evidence will show he had no big fat motive to make gobs of money , ' Springer said . <p> Treadway 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an assistant controller who helped oversee how Qwest accounted for deals , blind to details of the ASFB deal . Once , Graham went to Treadway 's supervisor to complain about Treadway 's questioning of the deal , Treadway 's attorneys said . <p> ' Mr. Treadway raised a number of concerns and became a pain in the neck on this transaction - not a collaborator , ' said Steve Cowen , one of Treadway 's attorneys . <p> After the opening arguments , the first witness in the case described changes in standard delivery and storage procedures that led to a scramble to take delivery of $ 7 million of equipment in the deal so Qwest could book the revenue immediately . <p> At the last moment , Qwest had to rent extra warehouse space in Tempe , Ariz. , to store the rush order of Cisco equipment for the ASFB deal , said Sara Givens , a retired materials manager from Phoenix . <p> ' We had many trucks out in the parking lot trying to deliver many pieces of equipment . a In some cases there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility , ' Givens said . <p> The trial , which began Feb. 17 , is expected to last five to six weeks . <p> Watching the arguments Monday were more than two dozen family members of the defendants , and lawyers of upcoming witnesses . Among the family in the room were Treadway 's wife and her parents ; Hall 's wife and his three sisters ; and Walker 's wife and her parents . <p> Denver Post business writer Tom McGhee contributed to this report . <p> CASE AGAINST QWEST <p> Charges : 12 counts each , including fraud and conspiracy stemming from a 2001 deal between Qwest and the Arizona School Facilities Board . Federal prosecutors say the deal was manipulated , causing Qwest to book an additional $ 33.6 million in revenue in the second quarter of 2001 when accounting rules dictated the revenue should have been logged over several quarters . <p> Defense : Attorneys for Grant Graham and Thomas Hall say Qwest made their clients scapegoats . Bryan Treadway 's attorney says others hid important details of the deal from his client .
