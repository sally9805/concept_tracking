X-Men(tm) The Last Stand By A Novelization by Chris Claremont Random House A Novelization by Chris Claremont The moment her best friend died , Jean Grey first dreamed of fire , and dancing among the stars . Neighbors since they were born , inseparable once they could crawl , she and Annie Malcolm shared toys and sandboxes , secrets and dreams , their parents , their entire lives . They had ten years together . They never saw the car that brought that to an end . Blind curve , guy 's in a hurry , Annie feeling competitive , totally focused on the Frisbee Jean had thrown . Reacting , not thinking , no consideration of anything but the prize , as a wayward breeze scooped the plastic disk up just beyond her reach . Tantalizing , infuriating , beyond wicked , to come so close and then fall short . For Annie , that was unacceptable . She made a spectacular catch . Jean cheered . Her smile was so special , a flash of pure delight that burned itself indelibly on Jean 's memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so completely , it was almost as though she 'd never been , thrown aside like a sackcloth dummy . There was a flash of shape and color , something big and powerful moving too fast to properly register -- afterwards , when Jean tried to describe the vehicle to the police , what came out was more monster than machine . It was the first time -- the only time -- that herperfect memory ever failed her . Or perhaps it was just that she did n't care about the car . She heard a squeal as the driver fought for control , stomping on his brakes too late to make a difference , then the roar of an accelerating engine rapidly fading in the distance , as shock gave way to panic and he decided to save himself instead . Jean had eyes only for her friend , draped against the wall of piled fieldstone that formed the property line along River Road . Annie lay unmoving , all crumpled and bloody and broken . Sobbing , face twisted with denial , Jean dropped to her knees , hands trembling as she reached out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name -- although every family in the neighborhood claimed later that they heard her piercing scream of anguish and horror . She repeated the name over and over , like a mantra , as if simply by saying the word she could anchor spirit to flesh and keep her friend from slipping away . Then , she heard Annie call her name . Instinct guided her to take a hand in both of hers , and Jean cried out again , a hoarse coughing exclamation that gave voice to all the pain balled up inside her friend . There were bursts of ice and fire along one side , scrapes and busted ribs , and a burning within one arm that told Jean it too was broken , and more pain where Annie had cracked her skull against one of the stones . That was the source of a lot of the blood , painting her face and now Jean as well as she stroked Annie 's brow and tried to kiss the pain away . There was a dull ache near the bottom of her back , a gaping hollowness in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized she 'd forgotten to breathe , and with a frantic gulp of air realized to her horror that Annie could n't . Her back was broken . She could n't bear to look anymore and closed her eyes -- only that did n't help . Instead , it simply took her somewhere else . Her own heart was a trip-hammer , pounding too hard and fast for her to separate the beats , her breath coming in shallow gasps that matched its cadence , like an animal in a terror trance , standing helpless before the predator who seeks its life . That made Jean angry ; she hated being afraid and refused to be a victim , even of fate itself . She thought at first she 'd blacked out , because around her all was darkness . And then , of course , she assumed hallucinations as images rolled towards her out of that darkness , blurry in the distance , resolving as they moved closer into visions of people and places . She saw herself , arms thrown straight up as though signaling a touchdown , thought ( absurdly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was wearing them now and she was looking at herself only moments ago , celebrating Annie 's catch . Her mind took the connection a step further ; she looked more closely at the other images floating past her and she knew that they were Annie 's memories . They seemed to be coming from a central source , like stars being spun clear of the core of a spiral galaxy . Without hesitation she plunged into the heart of that glorious radiance , face transfixed with awe and wonder at the unimaginable myriad of colors and shapes that represented all of her friend 's life-experience . She could n't help grinning at the recognition of how many of them seemed to relate to her , and how richly textured they were . She was still thinking in purely human terms and assumed that when she reached the heart of the radiance , she 'd be this incredibly tiny dust mote facing some unimaginably huge representation of Annie . Instead , she came to her as an equal -- only her body appeared wholly solid , whereas Annie 's was boiling away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of memories -- some birthday or other , a trip to grandma 's , boring days at school -- tumble off into the distance until they were gone , swallowed up in darkness . Again operating from an instinct she did n't understand , Jean reached out to try to catch them , but she might as well have been a ghost herself , grabbing at the wind . They would n't be snared , could n't be held . She heard Annie call her name . They both knew what was happening ; neither dared say it aloud . " Do n't be scared , Annie , " Jean said . " Show me how , ' kay ? " " You 've got to hold on , Annie , you ca n't give up . " " I 'm broken , Jean . There 's nothing I can do . " " Stop it ! Do n't you dare talk like that , I wo n't let you go ! " The passion surprised them both , a fierce rage that outlined Jean , just for a moment , in a corona of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fire plunged into Annie , making her gasp with surprise as her fading radiance glowed more brightly . " See , " Jean cried triumphantly . " See ! I can help ! I can save you ! " But Annie knew better . " It is n't making a difference , Jean , not so it matters . " " Shut up , I 'm working here . " " Do you have a clue what you 're doing ? " Annie asked . " Making it up as I go . What do you care , so long as you come out all right ? " " Ai n't gon na happen . " " Watch me . " " No , Jean , " Annie said , " watch me . " Jean did n't want to , but Annie was by far the more determined of the two , always had been , with a focus ( stubbornness , some said ) that was legendary . They were still of the same size , a pair of galaxies , islands of breathtaking light and color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now though , while Jean remained essentially coherent , Annie had spun off so much quantum substance that she was translucent . Yet she was visibly the more dynamic of the two -- the part of her that remained burned far more brightly than it should , because Jean was sustaining it with her own energies . The consequence was that Jean 's own life-glow had dimmed considerably . " Let me go , " Annie said quietly . " No . " Jean could be just as muleheaded . " Please . " " You 're my best friend . " " Can you make me better ? " " What do you mean ? " " Can you fix the all of me that 's broken ? Can you find the all of me that 's lost ? " Annie waved a barely corporeal arm to indicate what remained of her body , the mass of imagery cascading ever faster into oblivion . Jean 's face twisted with a grief she 'd never imagined , did n't think could possibly be endured . " I. Do n't . Know . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went still with resolve . She would find a way , no matter what it took . She refused to accept that she could n't . " You ca n't stay , " Annie told her . " I wo n't leave you . " " Do you want to die , too ? Look at yourself , Jean . " " I 'm fine . " " I can barely see you . You 've poured so much light into me , yours is almost gone . If you give me all your strength , how will you find your way home ? " " We 're going home together . " " No . " With that , Annie lunged forward , catching Jean by surprise in an embrace that carried with it every bit of love and affection , every remaining aspect of their shared lives . She thrust both hands into the core of Jean 's being and returned the strength Jean had given her . Too much power , too fast ! It burst outward like a star going supernova , impossibly -- for that single flash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Against such a display , Annie was too small to even quantify . For Jean , this was beyond revelation . She understood none of it , on any level . The emotions were too primal for a child 's mind to comprehend , and she had no resources of intellect or spirit that could give her even a hope of coping . She 'd been cast into a maelstrom and knew only enough to hold fast to herself until it ran its course , praying fate was smiling on her enough to survive .
