Joe Lieberman may be best known as a moral leader , but he 's also a politician  --  one who has aggressively defended his state 's corporate interests . In his 12 Senate years , he has been a dogged advocate for Connecticut 's top employers in the pharmaceutical , insurance and defense industries . <P> There 's nothing uncommon  --  or wrong  --  about a politician 's working on behalf of his constituents ; Lieberman 's service is no different from a Michigan politician 's protecting the auto industry or a Texas politician 's looking out for big oil . But it helps explain his enormous popularity in Connecticut , the generous contributions he has received from its industries and some of the positions he has taken on their behalf . <P> Insurance companies , for instance , have handed him more cash ( $197,000 ) than any other Senator has received this election . That has not kept Lieberman from favoring a plan that would give patients a new right to sue their insurer-owned HMOs . But in general he has been eager to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Democrats who support limits on the liability of corporations and , in turn , their insurers for injuries caused by products and services . He has sponsored bills to reduce the number of lawsuits by workplace victims of asbestos and to eliminate legal claims for pain and suffering by car-accident victims in return for lower insurance rates . He also fought for procedural hurdles and caps on suits resulting from Y2K failures . <P> Lieberman is also a top recipient of money from the drug industry  --  $91,000 in this election . Pfizer , which operates a major research facility in Connecticut , flew him on its corporate jet to a lavish resort in West Virginia , where he spoke at a large drug-company gathering in 1998 . This treatment has not kept him from pushing for prescription-drug benefits for Medicare recipients  --  something the pharmaceutical firms fear will lead to government control of their prices . But Lieberman helped pass an amendment that prevented low-priced generic drugs from being made available to consumers earlier ; that has helped maintain billions of dollars in sales for the brand-name producers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required manufacturers of medical devices like syringes to be fully accurate in labeling . And he voted to make it optional , rather than mandatory , for producers of medical devices like pacemakers and artificial heart valves to track the performance of their products after implantation . <P> For the defense industry , which has given Lieberman $63,000 in campaign cash this year , the Senator has used his seat on the Armed Services Committee to foster production of the Navy Seawolf submarine in Groton and land a $2.15 billion contract for a tactical fighter whose Pratt &; Whitney engine is built in Hartford . <P> Of the pro-industry votes , Lieberman spokesman Dan Gerstein said , " It 's not a question of benefiting a company but protecting jobs and economic interests in Connecticut . He votes in the best interests of his constituents . " <P>  --  By Michael Weisskopf and Adam Zagorin . With reporting by Douglas Waller
