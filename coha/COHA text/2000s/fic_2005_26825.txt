Tony Hillerman : The Leaphorn &; Chee Novels Skinwalkers , A Thief of Time , Coyote Waits Skinwalkers Chapter One When the cat came through the little trapdoor at the bottom of the screen it made a clack-clack sound . Slight , but enough to awaken Jim Chee . Chee had been moving in and out of the very edge of sleep , turning uneasily on the narrow bed , pressing himself uncomfortably against the metal tubes that braced the aluminum skin of his trailer . The sound brought him enough awake to be aware that his sheet was tangled uncomfortably around his chest . He sorted out the bedclothing , still half immersed in an uneasy dream of being tangled in ' a rope that he needed to keep his mother 's sheep from running over the edge of something vague and dangerous . Perhaps the uneasy dream provoked an uneasiness about the cat . What had chased it in ? Something scary to a cat  --  or to this particular cat . Was it something threatening to Chee ? But in a moment he was fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Landon would be coming . Blue-eyed , slender , fascinating Mary Landon would be coming back from Wisconsin . Just a couple of weeks more to wait . Jim Chee 's conditioning  --  traditional Navajo  --  caused him to put that thought aside . All things in moderation . He would think more about that later . Now he thought about tomorrow . Today , actually , since it must be well after midnight . Today he and Jay Kennedy would go out and arrest Roosevelt Bistie so that Bistie could be charged with some degree of homicide  --  probably with murder . Not a complicated job , but unpleasant enough to cause Chee to change the subject of his thinking again . He thought about the cat . What had driven it in ? The coyote , maybe . Or what ? Obviously something the cat considered a threat . The cat had appeared last winter , finding itself a sort of den under a juniper east of Chee 's trailer  --  a place where a lower limb , a boulder , and a rusted barrel formed a closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neighbor . During the spring , Chee had formed a habit of leaving out table scraps to feed it after heavy snows . Then when the snow melt ended and the spring drought arrived , he began leaving out water in a coffee can . But easy water attracted other animals , and birds , and sometimes they turned it over . And so , one afternoon when there was absolutely nothing else to do , Chee had removed the door , hacksawed out a cat-sized rectangle through its bottom frame , and then attached a plywood flap , using leather hinges and Miracle Glue . He had done it on a whim , partly to see if the ultracautious cat could be taught to use it . If the cat did , it would gain access to a colony of field mice that seemed to have moved into Chee 's trailer . And the watering problem would be solved . Chee felt slightly uneasy about the water . If he had n't started this meddling , nature would have taken its normal course . The cat would have moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Juan  --  which was never dry . But Chee had interfered . And now Chee was stuck with a dependent . Chee 's interest , originally , had been simple curiosity . Once , obviously , the cat had been owned by someone . It was skinny now , with a long scar over its ribs and a patch of fur missing from its right leg , but it still wore a collar , and , despite its condition , it had a purebred look . He 'd described it to the woman in the pet store at Farmington  --  tan fur , heavy hind legs , round head , pointed ears ; reminded you of a bobcat , and like a bobcat it had a mere stub of a tail . The woman had said it must be a Manx . " Somebody 's pet . People are always bringing their pets along on vacations , " she 'd said , disapproving , " and then they do n't take care of them and they get out of the car and that 's the end of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bring it in , " so somebody can take care of it . " Chee doubted if he could get his hands on the cat , and had n't tried . He was too much the traditional Navajo to interfere with an animal without a reason . But he was curious . Could such an animal , an animal bred and raised by the white man , call up enough of its hunting instincts to survive in the Navajo world ? The curiosity gradually turned to a casual admiration . By early summer , the animal had accumulated wisdom with its scar tissue . It stopped trying to hunt prairie dogs and concentrated on small rodents and birds . It learned how to hide , how to escape . It learned how to endure . It also learned to follow the water can into Chee 's trailer rather than make the long climb down to the river . Within a week the cat was using the flap when Chee was away . By midsummer it began coming in when he was at home .

But now , in August , the cat virtually ignored him . It had come inside at nightonly once before-driven in by a pack of dogs that had flushed it out of its den under the juniper . Chee looked around the trailer . Far too dark to see where the cat had gone . He pushed the sheet aside , swung his feet to the floor . Through the screened window beside his bed he noticed the moon was down . Except far to the northwest , where the remains of a thunderhead lingered , the sky was bright with stars . Chee yawned , stretched , went to the sink , and drank a palmful of water warm from the tap . The air smelled of dust , as it had for weeks ...
