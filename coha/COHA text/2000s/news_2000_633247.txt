<p> The Champion enters the room , a warm smile breaking above his trademark dimpled chin , and delivers a firm handshake before inviting a guest to take a seat in his comfortable , art-filled Beverly Hills home . <p> His hair may be white , his hands may be wrinkled with age , and he may struggle with words , but there is a sparkle in Kirk Douglas ' eyes , his mind is still as sharp as a tack , and he weaves abundant self-deprecating humor throughout his conversation . <p> " I think the most important thing is humor , " says the 83-year-old actor , who suffered a life-threatening stroke in January 1996 . " You have to laugh at yourself . " <p> In fact , he notes wryly , there are certain advantages to his speech impairment . " You do n't insult people because it takes too much energy . " And , he adds , " you can remain strong and silent and make people think you are thinking deep thoughts . " <p> Douglas concedes that sometimes , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech " is n't so good . " <p> " So , do n't upset me ! " he cracks with a smile . <p> Douglas has not lost his ability to deliver a comic line . Just like he did at a recent convention of speech therapists in San Francisco , where he told the gathering , " I 've discovered that when I talk slowly , people listen ! They think I 'm going to say something important . " <p> Or , when he tells his son , actor Michael Douglas , that they really should hurry up and make a picture together . " I say , ' Mikey , if you keep waiting , I am going to become too expensive for you . ' " <p> As one of Hollywood 's living screen legends , Douglas ' story is well known and often told . <p> He received Oscar nominations for his roles in " Champion , " " The Bad and the Beautiful " and " Lust for Life , " and formed one of Hollywood 's first independent film companies , the Bryna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such films as " Paths of Glory , " " The Vikings , " " Spartacus , " " Lonely Are the Brave " and " Seven Days in May . " He is also credited with breaking the infamous Hollywood blacklist , when in 1958 , he gave screen credit to blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo for " Spartacus . " <p> In some ways , life has come full circle for Douglas , for just as he once starred as a prizefighter in " Champion , " he now plays a feisty onetime welterweight champion in his newest film , " Diamonds " ( opening Friday in Chicago at the Esquire ) . <p> It is Douglas ' first movie since the stroke and serves as an affirmation to Hollywood and his fans that the man is back , that despite the stroke and a horrible 1991 helicopter crash that left Douglas injured and two other men dead , life has n't beaten him down . <p> " Working again agrees with me , " he says , still cutting a handsome figure in his aqua-blue turtleneck . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my agent says , ' You ca n't work more than six hours a day . ' Listen , I worked sometimes 14 hours . " <p> It may be the autumn of his life , but to Douglas it is spring again . <p> Patricia T. Green , who produced " Diamonds " for Total Film Group , can only marvel at Douglas ' energy , but also noted there is much more to admire about the man . <p> " I have to say that the things that I appreciated the most from him were his generosity and his knowledge , " she says . " And he admits to having not always been this way . He told me , ' I was n't always like this  --  as generous and open to people . But now , because of the stroke and the crash , I know that I 'm here for a reason . ' " <p> The stroke had hit him while he was having a manicure in his room . " Suddenly , I felt a slight tingling line go across my right cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was n't painful , but when I tried to speak , I just babbled . " <p> At first , Douglas experienced deep depression . <p> " I would pull down the blinds , crawl into bed and cry , " he said . <p> But what helped turn things around , he said , was when his family persuaded him to accept an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement at the March 1996 Academy Awards ceremony . <p> " I just wanted to say , ' Thank you , ' but when I went there , I saw 3,000 people standing up giving me an ovation , " he recalls , " so I said more than ' Thank you . ' " <p> Looking out on the crowd that night , Douglas motioned toward his sons who sat with tears in their eyes , and said , " They 're proud of the old man . And , I 'm proud , too  --  proud to be part of Hollywood for 50 years . " <p> That might have been the last public performance for Kirk Douglas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the end for me as an actor unless silent pictures come back . ' " <p> But the curtain did n't fall . He received a script titled " Sundowning " that featured a man with Alzheimer 's disease . Douglas told producer Green and director John Asher that he would love to make the movie but suggested that the central character might work just as well as a stroke victim . " Diamonds " was born . <p> Douglas poured himself into the role of Harry Agensky , a onetime welterweight champion who is suddenly left defenseless by the loss of his wife and the aftereffects of a stroke . Hoping to avoid the old folks ' home , he enlists his son ( Dan Aykroyd ) and teenage grandson ( Corbin Allred ) to accompany him to Reno , Nev. , to hunt down the so-called " magic diamonds " that a mobster once promised him for throwing a fight . <p> Although initially nervous over whether he could even talk , Douglas got himself in shape for the part by keeping up with a daily regimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became part of the movie . The producers even had a perfect prop for the film  --  boxing footage of Douglas in his prime in " Champion . " <p> The movie reunited Douglas with Lauren Bacall , with whom he co-starred in the 1950 film " Young Man With a Horn . " <p> " When I called her , I said , ' Betty , I 'm doing a movie . I think there is a great part for you . ' She said , ' Well , what 's the part ? ' I said , ' The madam of a whorehouse . ' She said , ' You sonofabitch ! ' " <p> Filming got under way in November 1998 and ended the second week in January . <p> " Kirk is in every scene , " Green says . " He never had a day off . " <p> In one scene where Douglas , Aykroyd and Allred are driving in a car , she recalls , Douglas surprised everyone by suggesting that he be allowed to take the wheel and drive off without Aykroyd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit , " Green recalls , " because he thought we were crazy to let him drive . But off he goes and he does it and everybody claps . " <p> Douglas gets up to show a guest around his house . Notice , he says , there is no movie memorabilia , although he still keeps his scripts on a shelf along with a fake Oscar that his wife and son Peter gave him many years ago when everyone was telling him he would win an Academy Award for " Lust for Life , " but then did n't . <p> The Douglases have lived in the same house in Beverly Hills for 22 years and , before that , brought up their family in a larger house three blocks away for 20 years . <p> The homes had once been filled with priceless artwork , but the Douglases decided to sell a number of their expensive paintings , including a Picasso , a Miro and a Chagall , to fund the Anne and Kirk Douglas Foundation . The foundation funds a variety of projects , including Cedars-Sinai Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Country Home and restoration of more than 80 neglected playgrounds at schools around Los Angeles and others in Israel . <p> Asked how he would like to be remembered , Douglas says his epitaph should read : " I tried . " <p> " If you try your best , " he says , " there 's nothing else you can do . " <p> He brushes his white hair back with both hands . <p> " For a guy who ca n't talk , " he says , " I talk a lot . "
