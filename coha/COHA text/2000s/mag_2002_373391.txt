Country musicians are n't born dull , but they 're quick studies . It is a generally held country principle that rough edges translate into lower sales , so record labels often send their most promising acts to media-training schools for a good dulling down . The stars of the future are then taught how to smile with lots of teeth , tilt their hats at the proper roguish  --  but not too roguish  --  angle and repeat variations on the " I 'm just so glad to be making the music I love " palaver that plays between videos on Country Music Television . On her first day at media school , the Dixie Chicks ' lead singer Natalie Maines told her instructor an oral-sex joke . The Dixie Chicks flunked media school . <P> The Chicks  --  Maines , 27 , and a pair of sisters , Emily Robison , 30 , and Martie Maguire , 32  --  are the most personable ( and ribald ) act in country music . As achievements go , this is like being the funniest guy in Belgium . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of cheerleaders caught smoking under the bleachers ; they were rascals , but lovable rascals . After all , they moved tons of records , and their music was built around traditional country instruments ( dobro , fiddle , mandolin ) that they played themselves . But then the Chicks went from rascals to rebels : they sued their record company in the ugliest financial squabble in recent country history . " Now , " says Maines , " I realize that until this whole thing with Sony , we were complete wusses . " <P> The war with Sony started in 2001 , after the group 's first two albums , Wide Open Spaces and Fly , sold more than 10 million copies apiece . In an interview with Dan Rather that aired on CBS , the Chicks announced that by their math , Sony had made $200 million off them but that individually they had yet to gross seven figures . Then , in a move that sent shock waves through Nashville ( admittedly it 's a town that 's easily shocked ) , the Chicks served Sony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting misdeeds , they were declaring themselves free agents . " We all know there are some major problems in the music industry , " says Maguire . " Every new act signs a bad deal . But we never dreamed that the s deal we signed would n't even be honored . " <P> Sony sued the group for breach of contract ; the Chicks countersued , alleging " systematic thievery . " As the charges escalated , the Chicks found themselves Nashville pariahs . For country acts , the relationship between label and band has historically been in loco parentis ; bands presumed the label always knew best . " Everyone in the country industry kept telling us , ' Keep your mouths shut . Why do n't you appreciate what you have ? ' " says Maguire .
