. Do n't let the approach of darkness keep you from getting back home safely . Follow these tips the next time you 're forced to run at night . ALTHOUGH MANY OF US enjoy a moonlight cruise or a pleasant , after-dark run , most of us prefer to take the wheel during daylight hours and tuck the boat into a friendly berth by nightfall . But unexpected delays will occur , which means you could find yourself in strange waters as the shadows fall . Here are a few practical tips that can make the process of getting home easier . Running Offshore 1 Compare the sequence and timing of observed nav aids with those on your chart . Changes in the characteristics of lit buoys  --  especially those in a long channel leading inshore from a sea buoy  --  can be significant . For instance , a quick flashing light in a line of one or two second flashers may indicate a turn in a channel or a nearby obstruction. 2 Lit aids are rarely fixed or steady . A fixed or steady red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinks or exhibits any type of sequence , it most likely is a nav aid . Among the exceptions are the flashing yellow lights on the bow of the first in a line of pushed barges , and , of course , the flashing blues of a sea cop . 3 Be intimately and instantly familiar with the basic range and running lights of ships and the towing lights of tugs and barges . In a nutshell , the lower of a ship 's two white range lights is forward and the higher is aft . Therefore , if you see one above the other , in range , the ship is heading directly towards you . The required visible range of a ship 's running lights is significantly less than that of his range lights . So , if you observe his red and green as well as his range lights , the ship is probably less than two miles away . 4 The tug that exhibits three white towing lights is towing his barge(s) well astern . The tug that exhibits two white towing lights is either pushing ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( red and green running , no range lights ) but in real life , barge lights are often dim and hard to see . If you spot a tug with three in-line white lights , do n't even think of passing astern of him . Running Inside 1 Harbor and channel lit nav aids can be obscured by background lights on land that are often considerably brighter than the aids . However , the background lights rarely have the kind of sequence of a nav aid . Slow down and scan the area . Your eyes will pick up the aids. 2 When running a channel , especially in the ICW , one strategically placed lit aid will appear as you leave the next ; stay center channel to avoid hitting the unlit aids . In twisting channels , match the aids with your chart ; many boaters have gone aground by heading for an aid that 's around a bend in the channel . The lit aids in such channels will always have varying sequences . Match the sequences with the chart  --  a stopwatch helps  --  and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparingly . It interferes with night vision , which can take many minutes to recover . If you 're trying to pick up the reflective tape on unlit buoys , try a low-powered flashlight . If you must use the big gun , avoid shining it on your reflective topsides . Flash in short bursts only . Running Bridges 1 The navigable span of a fixed bridge will always have a light in its center . Head directly for that light . Multi-span bridges  --  especially multi-lane highway bridges  --  will have lights on either side of the span . Those lights are designed to be used as a range . Keep them in line as you pass underneath to stay in the center of the channel . 2 Bascule , lift and swing bridges show red lights when they are closed and green when open . 3 On almost all bridges , there will be wooden fendering around the pilings of the preferred span . Often , there will be a fixed red light on the channel end of the fendering ; it provides another point of reference . 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deceptive . A quick , well-aimed burst of your spotlight at the base of the bridge fendering will give you a good idea of a current 's speed and direction . 5 Give way to commercial traffic . If in doubt , chat with the other vessel . Most commercial crews monitor channel 13 , which is also the bridge channel everywhere except Florida , where crews monitor channels 9 and 16 ( hail on 9 ) . BOX BOAT PREP FOR A NIGHT RUN I run a darkened ship at night  --  running lights and redtinged instrumentation only  --  because I believe in maintaining night vision . And I do n't want to ruin it by switching a light on to find something . Before the trip , I try to place whatever I 'll need so that I can grab it by touch . I put lifejackets , heaving and dock lines , my tool kit and first-aid packet where I can lay hands on them sight unseen . A boat I run has a powerful spotlight mounted on the cabin roof ; while the on/off switch is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical panel . Now , I count switches down and can find the spotlight switch blind . I always turn the water-pressure pump switch off when running because if a hose breaks or a fitting fails , I wo n't hear the pump over the noise of the engines . But when passengers want running water , they want it now , so I show them how to find the panel switch by feel when they need to hit the tap . Can you find the important switches on your panel without looking ? The ability to do so may come in handy some day  --  or night . BOX DOCKING TIP : BACKING IN A commercial ferry skipper I know has a knack for backing to a bulkhead at full tilt before coming to a dead stop at the feet of 125 commuters . In that Wall St. terminal , he has to back fast to stay on schedule . Drivers of recreational twin-screw boats can learn a thing or two about backing in quickly from this skilled captain . First , visualize a point in the water about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an onshore wind or current , find a point that 's two or more boat lengths ahead . Come in fast ( top illustration ) and chop the throttles when you get to that point ( bottom ) . It wo n't take long for you to assess the remaining distance and slide the boat in . Your basic cruiser will lose way a lot quicker in reverse than in forward when power is reduced . The trick is to back all the way off  --  throw it in neutral . After a while , you 'll know exactly where the boat will stop . After it stops , quickly ease astern again and let the boat slide into the slip with just a light touch of forward throttle to stop it once more . PULLQUOTE If it blinks or exhibits any type of sequence , it most likely is a navigation aid , although there are exceptions  --  among them , the flashing blue lights of a water cop .
