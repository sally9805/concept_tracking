Foreground // My childhood came to a virtual halt when I was around five years old . That was when my grandfather banished my father from our lives forever for some transgression that was not to be disclosed to us children , though we overheard whispered references to bankruptcy , bootlegging , and jail time . His name was never again spoken in our presence ; he just abruptly disappeared from our lives . The shame and disgrace that enveloped our family as a result of these events , along with the ensuing divorce , just about destroyed my mother . Is it possible today to make anyone understand the harsh judgment of such failures in the late 1920 's ? Throughout my entire life , whenever I was asked about my father , I always said that he was dead . When he actually died I never knew . // So it was that Grandma and Grandpa chose to make our family of five  --  Mama , my ten-year-old brother Jack , my eight-year-old brother John , my one-year-old sister Avis , and me  --  their responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandpa 's four farms , which was located about three miles from the village of Garrison , where they had retired after a lifetime of farming . However , because the fierce blizzards and subzero temperatures of Iowa winters made it hazardous to walk to the one-room rural school we would be attending , it had been arranged that we would live with Grandma and Grandpa in Garrison and attend school there from January until the school year ended in mid-May . At that time our family would move out to the farm . Each year from then on , we went to school in the country from September until Christmas , then moved back to Garrison and finished the school year in town . // Our new life began when we arrived at Grandma and Grandpa 's on a cold winter day in February . The house we moved into that day was a large , substantial structure . It was located about seven miles from Vinton , the seat of Benton County . Grandpa was born , raised , married , and buried all within an eight-mile radius of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents had settled as pioneers . // Though the house we shared boasted eight large rooms , suggesting that we had lots of space and privacy , in fact , all seven of us spent most of our waking hours confined to the living room and the kitchen because they were the only rooms that were heated . The frigid upstairs bedrooms were rarely used except for sleeping . The conditions under which we lived were a perfect demonstration of the wisdom of Kahlil Gibran 's observation : " Let there be spaces in your togetherness. " // Grandpa and Grandma must have had some unspoken , perhaps even unrecognized , resentment at having toiled all their lives raising their own family , only to be confronted with the inescapable fact that now , retired at last , they had to do the whole thing all over again and raise their daughter 's " spawn , " as Grandma often referred to us . And all of this was happening at the worst possible time , during the Depression . // All three generations suffered . We kids were under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how we spent our days , how we spoke and dressed , and how we behaved . ( In a good many ways , they never quite made it into the twentieth century . ) Suddenly we were subjected to a completely new set of rules , which governed every aspect of our lives . The whole family had to go to bed at a set time every night and get up at a set time every morning . We all had to be fully dressed for the day before we ate breakfast . We all had to sit down at a properly set table three times a day , and we all had to eat what was served on that table . Generally Grandpa would choose the menu for breakfast because he was the first one up . If he decided he wanted oatmeal , then everyone ate oatmeal ; if he decided he wanted pancakes , then everyone ate pancakes ; whether he selected sorghum , honey , or molasses as the sweetener , all were required to accept his choice . We were allowed no say in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of " Waste not , want not , " we were required to eat everything on our plates . If we did n't , the food was set aside and served to us at the next meal . Generally , unless it was a Saturday and we had cousins visiting , there was no eating between meals . // Through this regimentation , the austere habits that Grandma and Grandpa had adopted and lived by for decades were imposed on us with a vengeance . And we often resented their severity . To be fair , I must note that it was those habits that made it possible for them to acquire four debt-free farms by the time we came to live with them . Now , there 's an achievement not to be overlooked . // Nonetheless , Grandma and Grandpa were what the locals called " land-poor "  --  people who owned a lot of land but had very little money . And even what little they had they tried to save . The only things they spent money on were tea , coffee , sugar , salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later I came to understand that there was a good reason for them to want to save money . They needed it to pay the taxes on their farms , three of which they had rented out to the families of their daughters . Due to the deepening Depression , they could never be sure if the rent would actually be paid . If the rent did not come in , there would be no money to pay the taxes and the farms would be lost . We children sensed , but could not really understand , the awful threat of that disastrous economy . I had to grow to adulthood before I could even begin to comprehend the impact of what was happening in those days  --  the disappearance of money and jobs , the loss of machinery and farms , the bank failures that took people 's entire savings . // Though we did n't understand them , we children were seldom protected from the harsh realities of the period , and we certainly sensed that something terrible was happening . Indelibly stamped in my memory is the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wintry March morning when I was perhaps six years old . There I entered to find all the stalwart adults of my world  --  Grandma , Grandpa , Mama , my aunt and uncle  --  still and wordless as statues . It was clear that they had been crying . I had never seen adults cry . I did n't know they could cry . I was struck mute with a fear that grabbed me right in the guts . Though I was given no explanation at the time , in the days that followed I overheard enough to realize that Grandpa 's brother and sister had each lost their farm , all of their machinery and all of their livestock , for reasons that were unfathomable to me . What can a child know of vast economic forces operating on a global level ? I was stunned and afraid . // Grandma and Grandpa 's lives were changed forever by the plunging economy . It has taken me a lifetime to realize that the Depression and its consequent tragedies were nearly as incomprehensible to the adults as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening in the world , how could they explain the situation to us ? Suddenly , unexpectedly , a family of five was now the responsibility of two old people who had thought they were heading into a comfortable , if frugal , retirement . They must have been scared to death . // In Garrison , then , we children were required to adhere to the rigid routines set down for us by Grandma and Grandpa . But our lives changed radically when the school year ended around mid-May , for that was when we left Garrison for the country . The move to the country provided our little family with a welcome separation from our grandparents , and them with a no doubt equally welcome respite from us. // The farm we lived on was directly across the road from the farm where Mama 's sister , Aunt Hazel , her husband , Uncle Ernest , and their three sons lived . Unusual in Iowa , this proximity meant that there was much sharing and interaction between the two families . Feeling equally at home at both places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and chores . Indeed , the two properties were treated as one cooperative , if complicated , venture , though we maintained strictly separate households for eating , sleeping , and gardening . Each farm had its advantages . Aunt Hazel and Uncle Ernest 's farm was equipped with all the necessary implements , the buildings were properly maintained , and the livestock were well housed in winter and in summer ; but it had insufficient pastureland . Our place was older , and the house , the sheep shed , and the chicken houses were the only buildings habitable the year round . The ancient , though picturesque , barn had been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair , and provided proper shelter for horses , calves , chickens , ducks , and geese only during the mild months of summer and fall . However , the permanent and best pastures were on our side of the road . // Grandma and Grandpa visited the farms frequently in their very noisy Buick bringing food , household necessities , and goodies . On these visits they would stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then return to their home in the evening . They did this for all four of their daughters and their families . // It is no exaggeration to say that Grandpa and Grandma were about as compatible as two people could possibly be . They seldom argued ; they went everywhere and did everything together . However , there was one event  --  involving a gun  --  that must be chronicled , an event that was revived , relived , and recounted repeatedly during the time our family lived with them . It happened when they were young parents and lived on the farm that later came to be occupied by Aunt Hazel and Uncle Ernest . In those days guns were a part of farm life . Women as well as men learned to shoot . Every family owned at least three guns : a .22 rifle , and ten- and twelve-gauge shotguns . From early childhood we were taught to respect and care for guns . " The most dangerous gun , " we were cautioned , " is the one that is n't loaded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon understand . One winter day Grandpa was in the kitchen cleaning his guns and Grandma was upstairs making beds . Grandpa accidentally discharged his " unloaded " gun . Grandma started screaming . Grandpa ran from the kitchen and started running up the steep stairs just as Grandma started to run down . They slammed into each other on the landing at the right-angled turn of the stairs , connecting with such force that they knocked each other to the floor , whereupon , in their panic , they began to shout at each other . No matter how many times they told the story , they still could n't get over the fact that they had erupted in such outbursts. // " Why did you yell ? " Grandpa would ask Grandma at the conclusion of yet another retelling of the event . // " I yelled because I thought you had shot yourself . Why did you yell ? " // " I yelled because I thought that I had shot you ! " // They rehearsed this frightening event so often and vividly that I sometimes believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never able to get beyond their fright for each other 's well-being , nor were they ever able to see the burlesque humor in this event , which so entertained us grandchildren . Though there was a real possibility that the shot could have penetrated the ceiling and entered the bedroom , it turned out that it had lodged itself harmlessly in the doorsill between the kitchen and the living room . Curiously , Grandpa , who was so meticulous about everything , never // repaired that doorsill. // Our move to the farm when school let out meant that the rigidly ordered lives dictated by our grandparents were now governed by an entirely different set of expectations : our mother 's . Even though we had many more chores and responsibilities such as taking care of the livestock , preparing meals , and planting and tending gardens , we actually felt freer on the farm than in Garrison . In important ways our lives were more our own , and Mama often addressed and treated us as if we were adults  --  if only because she needed us to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mother . To a surprising extent , she simply let us go our own ways . She did n't mind when we went to bed or rose in the morning , if it was not a school day . She did n't care what , when , or if we ate . She did n't object if , in my nightgown , I trotted out to the henhouse to gather a couple of eggs and then , still in my nightgown , cooked a fried egg breakfast and ate it sitting outside on the sunny cellar door with my favorite cat . She ignored the niceties of setting places at mealtimes . Instead , she simply placed the food and utensils in the middle of the table and let us serve ourselves . // Mama almost never made an attempt to serve a balanced meal . If she had just taken bread from the oven around the middle of the day , our noon meal would consist of freshly made bread , homemade butter , whole plum jam , and a huge pitcher of milk . If , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we had nothing but buttered sweet corn for supper . Further , she did n't insist that we all eat at the table or that we all eat at the same time . // Of course , she did insist that we all do our assigned chores . Since it was obvious even to us children that it was necessary to meet our obligations to make the family operate , we seldom failed to do so , but we were allowed to create our own routines for our workdays  --  as did our mother , who had some very odd ideas about such matters . She marched to a different drummer , so to speak . Her priorities did not match those of most sensible people . One day she might iron or bake , even though the temperature had reached 95 degrees , on the grounds that she could not be made more uncomfortable than she already was . Yet the next day she might rise at dawn to start weeding in the garden because she liked the cool of the morning . // The real surprise is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup and bake superb cakes and pies , but she could never cook meat nor fry potatoes to anyone 's liking . She would either overcook or undercook , oversalt a dish or forget the salt altogether . At my brothers ' urging I gradually began taking over the everyday cooking for the family when I was not much more than eight years old . I apparently inherited a natural affinity for cooking from Grandma and , rather than feeling burdened by the responsibility , I felt honored . Throughout my life , my culinary skills have been a significant asset . // With the wisdom of advancing age , I have lately come to believe that Mama acted as she did because she was crushed by the stigma of her broken home and overwhelmed by the never-ending burden of tending to and raising four active children . She coped the best she could , and certainly she had many gifts and talents . She loved being out-of-doors and could work for hours husking corn , shocking oats , and gardening . She had a remarkable rapport with animals , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play the piano and sing . // Library of Congress subject headings for this publication : // Kalish , Mildred Armstrong  --  Childhood and youth . // Kalish , Mildred Armstrong  --  Family . // Farm life  --  Iowa  --  Benton County  --  History  --  20th century . // Benton County ( Iowa )  --  Social life and customs  --  20th century . // Depressions  --  1929  --  Iowa  --  Benton County . // New Deal , 1933-1939  --  Iowa  --  Benton County . // Rural families  --  Iowa  --  Benton County . // Benton County ( Iowa )  --  Rural conditions . // Benton County ( Iowa )  --  Biography . // Iowa  --  Social life and customs  --  20th century . //
