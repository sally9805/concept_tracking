Who says you need water in your food ? Dehydrate your vittles and you 'll carry less weight , save money , and eat better . By Diane Bailey // To put it simply , I go bananas over dried apples . I love their tangy , slightly sweet zip while I 'm hiking . Problem is , the store-bought variety comes complete with chemical preservatives and is n't cheap . That 's why I started drying my own . Then one day , after dehydrating enough apples to feed a battalion of backpackers , I realized as I stared at my home dehydrator that it was time to go beyond fruit . Here was the means of sucking out the water-and therefore weight  --  from many more foods , while preserving the vitamins , minerals , and taste ! I dove in head first , making a few mistakes along the way , but in the end , I came up with a trail diet that 's not only loaded with variety , taste , and nutrition , but also eco nomical . In addition , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dehydrator , is pretty darned easy . Here 's an introduction to dehydrating individual ingredients , all of which you can use to make fabulous one-pot trail meals ( see the recipes beginning on page 45 ) . The recipes also include snacks , sauces , and side dishes . Look in the next issue to learn how to dehydrate the gourmet meals you cook at home so you can enjoy them on the trail . GOING JUICELESS The secret of dehydration is to dry food at a temperature high enough to get rid of the water , but not so high that the food cooks . Moisture , which accounts for 60 to 90 percent of a food 's weight , acts as a natural petri dish for the yeast , molds , and bacteria that cause food to spoil on the trail . Drying time depends on a variety of factors ranging from the size of the food to the relative humidity of the air in your kitchen , so judging doneness is a skill learned through practice . Fruits and vegetables : These dry best between 120 deg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leathery than sticky and vegetables are brittle . Very fresh fruits and vegetables make the best dried products . Before drying veggies , blanch them until they 're slightly tender to help preserve flavor , color , and texture . Tomatoes , mushrooms , and onions are the exceptions ; they should be chopped and placed in the dehydrator without other preparation . Meats : Meat can be either cooked and preserved or made into jerky . Meats dry best at or above 145 deg F and are dry and flaky when done . Jerky is done if it cracks like a green twig when bent . Dried precooked meat is a spoilage-free , salt-free additive for soups and stews made in the field . After trimming off all visible fat , steam or roast red meat , fish , and poultry . Cool , cut into M-inch cubes or 1/4  --  inch-thick slices , and dry . Before drying lean ground beef , saute it , then remove as much fat as possible by rinsing the meat under hot water or draining it on layers of paper towels . Ever-popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt , soy sauce , ginger , and a variety of other seasonings ( see Moveable Feast , October 1996 , for recipes ) . The USDA recommends cooking meat to an internal temperature of 160 deg F to destroy bacteria before dehydrating ; call its Meat and Poultry Hotline at ( 800 ) 535-4555 for more information . Beef , game meats , and fish-especially trout , pink salmon , halibut , and cod-all make good jerky . To reduce the risk of food-borne illness , avoid using uncooked poultry or pork to make jerky . Dried tofu pleases the vegetarian crowd and carnivores looking for a change of pace . Marinate firm tofu , then dry it at 160 deg F until brittle . Rice and pasta : Save money and cooking time on the trail-and avoid the additives and preservatives in instant foods-by precooking rice and pasta . Most of the vitamins in instant rice are lost during processing and must be added later . Cook up an extra big batch of brown rice or whole-grain pasta for dinner at home , then dry the leftovers for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these foods . Both will rehydrate in warm water . STORAGE Keep dehydrated vittles in airtight containers in a cool , dry , dark place . Fruits and vegetables last about a year . Dried meats can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 weeks , and jerky for about a month ; refrigeration or freezing extends the shelf life of both . ON THE TRAIL Toss dehydrated foods in a cook pot , and let them absorb water while they simmer , or presoak them to cut cooking time . Putting your dried dinner veggies in a partially filled water bottle to soak at lunchtime will make them more tender later . A cup of dried food requires approximately 1 cup of water to revive ; use hot water and rip apart the food for faster rehydration . With a store of dried staples , vegetables , meats , and herbs , you 'll have everything you 'll need to create simple one-pot wonders in camp ( see the recipes below ) . Or , make a hearty soup broth or pasta sauce at home , dry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding 3 parts water to 1 part dried ingredients . Packaged dinners such as rice or noodles and sauce take on new qualities-in both taste and nutrition-when you add dried veggies or meats . You can even perk up oatmeal with a handful of banana chips . SNACKS TO DRY FOR Once you have the basics down , let your imagination take over . Some of my home  --  dried favorites are between-meal foods that help lift feet and spirits during tough uphill slogs or through the gray misery of a cold , rainy day . Here are a few ideas : Yogurt tarts . Drop teaspoonfuls of flavored yogurt onto a tray and dry them into deliciously tart drops . Although yogurt is a milk product , its acidity makes it safe for home drying . Seasoned veggie chips . For tasty , healthful trail snacks , dry zucchini slices dipped in tamari or tomato rounds sprinkled with dried basil . The more adventurous can puree vegetables to make vegetable leather ( see below ) . Bagel chips . Slice bagels into rounds about 1/8 inch thick , season with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hours until crisp . Trail mix . Dry and combine chunks of different kinds of fruit for a sweet , high  --  energy treat . Apples work well . Trust me-I 've dried bushels of them .
