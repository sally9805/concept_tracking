The Great Seduction // First a confession . Back in the Nineties , I was a pioneer in the first Internet gold rush . With the dream of making the world a more musical place , I founded Audiocafe.com , one of the earliest digital music sites . Once , when asked by a San Francisco Bay area newspaper reporter how I wanted to change the world , I replied , half seriously , that my fantasy was to have music playing from " every orifice , " to hear the whole Bob Dylan oeuvre from my laptop computer , to be able to download Johann Sebastian Bach ? s Brandenburg Concertos from my cellular phone . // So yes , I peddled the original Internet dream . I seduced investors and I almost became rich . This , therefore , is no ordinary critique of Silicon Valley . It ? s the work of an apostate , an insider now on the outside who has poured out his cup of Kool-Aid and resigned his membership in the cult . // My metamorphosis from believer into skeptic lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading an incorrect Wikipedia entry about T. H. Huxley or get struck by lightning while doing a search for myself on Google . My epiphany didn ? t involve a dancing coyote , so it probably wouldn ? t be a hit on YouTube. // It took place over forty-eight hours , in September 2004 , on a two-day camping trip with a couple of hundred Silicon Valley utopians . Sleeping bag under my arm , rucksack on my back , I marched into camp a member of the cult ; two days later , feeling queasy , I left an unbeliever. // The camping trip took place in Sebastopol , a small farming town in northern California ? s Sonoma Valley , about fifty miles north of the infamous Silicon Valley  --  the narrow peninsula of land between San Francisco and San Jose . Sebastopol is the headquarters of O ? Reilly Media , one of the world ? s leading traffickers of books , magazines , and trade shows about information technology , an evangelizer of innovation to a worldwide congregation of technophiles . It is both Silicon Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Each Fall , O ? Reilly Media hosts an exclusive , invitation-only event called FOO ( Friends of O ? Reilly ) Camp . These friends of multi-millionaire founder Tim O ? Reilly are not only unconventionally rich and richly unconventional but also harbor a messianic faith in the economic the cult of the amateur and cultural benefits of technology . O ? Reilly and his Silicon Valley acolytes are a mix of graying hippies , new media entrepreneurs , and technology geeks . What unites them is a shared hostility toward traditional media and entertainment . Part Woodstock , part Burning Man ( the contemporary festival of self-expression held in a desert in Nevada ) , and part Stanford Business School retreat , FOO Camp is where the countercultural Sixties meets the free-market Eighties meets the technophile Nineties . // Silicon Valley conferences weren ? t new to me . I had even organized one myself at the tail end of the last Internet boom . But FOO Camp was radically different . Its only rule was an unrule : " no spectators , only participants . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant that everyone talked a lot , and there was no one in charge . // So there we were , two hundred of us , Silicon Valley ? s antiestablishment establishment , collectively worth hundreds of millions of dollars , gazing at the stars from the lawn of O ? Reilly Media ? s corporate headquarters . For two full days , we camped together , roasted marshmallows together , and celebrated the revival of our cult together . // The Internet was back ! And unlike the Gold Rush Nineties , this time around our exuberance wasn ? t irrational . This shiny new version of the Internet , what Tim O ? Reilly called Web 2.0 , really was going to change everything . Now that most Americans had broadband access to the Internet , the dream of a fully networked , always-connected society was finally going to be realized . There was one word on every FOO Camper ? s lips in September 2004 . That word was " democratization. " // I never realized democracy has so many possibilities , so much revolutionary potential . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author-all were going to be democratized by Web 2.0 . The Internet would democratize Big Media , Big Business , Big Government . It would even democratize Big Experts , transforming them into what one friend of O ? Reilly called , in a hushed , reverent tone , " noble amateurs. " // Although Sebastopol was miles from the ocean , by the second morning of camp , I had begun to feel seasick . At first I thought it was the greasy camp food or perhaps the hot northern California weather . But I soon realized that even my gut was reacting to the emptiness at the heart of our conversation . // I had come to FOO Camp to imagine the future of media . I wanted to know how the Internet could help me " bring more music to more orifices . " But my dream of making the world a more musical place had fallen on deaf ears ; the promise of using technology to bring more culture to the masses had been drowned out by FOO Campers ? collective cry for a democratized media . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Dylan or the Brandenburg Concertos . Audience and author had become one , and we were transforming culture into cacophony. // FOO Camp , I realized , was a sneak preview . We weren ? t there just to talk about new media ; we were the new media . The event was a beta version of the Web 2.0 revolution , where Wikipedia met MySpace met YouTube . Everyone was simultaneously broadcasting themselves , but nobody was listening . Out of this anarchy , it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism , the survival of the loudest and most opinionated . Under these rules , the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering. // The more that was said that weekend , the less I wanted to express myself . As the din of narcissism swelled , I became increasingly silent . And thus began my rebellion against Silicon Valley . Instead of adding to the noise , I broke the one law of FOO Camp 2004 . I stopped participating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t stopped watching since . I ? ve spent the last two years observing the Web 2.0 revolution , and I ? m dismayed by what I ? ve seen . // I ? ve seen the infinite monkeys , of course , typing away . // And I ? ve seen many other strange sights as well , including a video of marching penguins selling a lie , a supposedly infinite Long Tail , and dogs chatting to each other online . But what I ? ve been watching is more like Hitchcock ? s The Birds than Doctor Doolittle : a horror movie about the consequences of the digital revolution . // Because democratization , despite its lofty idealization , is undermining truth , souring civic discourse , and belittling expertise , experience , and talent . As I noted earlier , it is threatening the very future of our cultural institutions . // I call it the great seduction . The Web 2.0 revolution has peddled the promise of bringing more truth to more people-more depth of information , more global perspective , more unbiased opinion from dispassionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Web 2.0 revolution is really delivering is superficial observations of the world around us rather than deep analysis , shrill opinion rather than considered judgment . The information business is being transformed by the Internet into the sheer noise of a hundred million bloggers all simultaneously talking about themselves . // Moreover , the free , user-generated content spawned and extolled by the Web 2.0 revolution is decimating the ranks of our cultural gatekeepers , as professional critics , journalists , editors , musicians , moviemakers , and other purveyors of expert information are being replaced ( " disintermediated , " to use a FOO Camp term ) by amateur bloggers , hack reviewers , homespun moviemakers , and attic recording artists . Meanwhile , the radically new business models based on user-generated material suck the economic value out of traditional media and cultural content . // We  --  those of us who want to know more about the world , those of us who are the consumers of mainstream culture  --  are being seduced by the empty promise of the " democratized " media . For the real consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable news , and a chaos of useless information . One chilling reality in this brave new digital epoch is the blurring , obfuscation , and even disappearance of truth . // Truth , to paraphrase Tom Friedman , is being " flattened , " as we create an on-demand , personalized version that reflects our own individual myopia . One person ? s truth becomes as " true " as anyone else ? s . Today ? s media is shattering the world into a billion personalized truths , each seemingly equally valid and worthwhile . To quote Richard Edelman , the founder , president , and CEO of Edelman PR , the world ? s largest privately owned public relations company : // In this era of exploding media technologies there is no truth except the truth you create for yourself . ( 1 ) // This undermining of truth is threatening the quality of civil public discourse , encouraging plagiarism and intellectual property theft , and stifling creativity . When advertising and public relations are disguised as news , the line between fact and fiction becomes blurred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that Web 2.0 really delivers is more dubious content from anonymous sources , hijacking our time and playing to our gullibility. // Need proof ? Let ? s look at that army of perjurious penguins- " Al Gore ? s Army of Penguins " to be exact . Featured on YouTube , the film , a crude " self-made " satire of Gore ? s pro-environment movie An Inconvenient Truth , belittles the seriousness of Al Gore ? s message by depicting a penguin version of Al Gore preaching to other penguins about global warning . // But " Al Gore ? s Army of Penguins " is not just another homemade example of YouTube inanity . Though many of the 120,000 people who viewed this video undoubtedly assumed it was the work of some SUV-driving amateur with an aversion to recycling , in reality , the Wall Street Journal traced the real authorship of this neocon satire to DCI Group , a conservative Washington , D.C. , public relationships and lobbying firm whose clients include Exxon-Mobil.2 The video is nothing more than political spin , enabled and perpetuated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In short , it is a big lie . // Blogs too , can be vehicles for veiled corporate propaganda and deception . In March 2006 , the New York Times reported about a blogger whose laudatory postings about Wal-Mart were " identical " to press releases written by a senior account supervisor at the Arkansas retailer ? s PR company . ( 3 ) Perhaps this is the same team behind the mysterious elimination of unflattering remarks about Wal-Mart ? s treatment of its employees on the retailer ? s Wikipedia entry . // Blogs are increasingly becoming the battlefield on which public relations spin doctors are waging their propaganda war . In 2005 , before launching a major investment , General Electric executives met with environmental bloggers to woo them over the greenness of a new energy-efficient technology . Meanwhile , multinationals like IBM , Maytag , and General Motors all have blogs that , under an objective guise , peddle their versions of corporate truth to the outside world . // But the anticorporate blogs are equally loose with the truth . In 2005 , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s blogger jumped on it as evidence of fast-food malfeasance . The bogus story cost Wendy ? s $2.5 million in lost sales as well as job losses and a decline in the price of the company ? s stock . // As former British Prime Minister James Callaghan said , " A lie can make its way around the world before the truth has the chance to put its boots on . " That has never been more true than with the speeding , freewheeling , unchecked culture of today ? s blogosphere . It doesn ? t require the gravitas of a world leader to appreciate the implications of this democratized media . In a flattened , editor-free world where independent videographers , // podcasters , and bloggers can post their amateurish creations at will , and no one is being paid to check their credentials or evaluate their material , media is vulnerable to untrustworthy content of every stripe  --  whether from duplicitous PR companies , multinational corporations like Wal-Mart and McDonald ? s , anonymous bloggers , or sexual predators with sophisticated invented identities . // Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitution ring didn ? t sponsor the famous YouTube video of the sexy Malaysian dancer ? Or that the Englishwoman in the YouTube video eating the chocolate and marmalade cookie isn ? t really being paid by United Biscuits Incorporated ? // Who is to say that the glowing review of The Cult of the Amateur on Amazon.com that might have led you to purchase this " brilliantly original " book wasn ? t authored by me , posing as an enthusiastic third party ? // As I ? ll discuss in more detail in Chapter 3 , truth and trust are the whipping boys of the Web 2.0 revolution . In a world with fewer and fewer professional editors or reviewers , how are we to know what and whom to believe ? Because much of the user-generated content on the Internet is posted anonymously or under a pseudonym , nobody knows who the real author of much of this self-generated content actually is . It could be a monkey . It could be a penguin . It could even be Al Gore . // Look at Wikipedia , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a professional encyclopedia like the Britannica , the identity of the volunteer editors on Wikipedia is unknown . These citizen editors out-edit other citizen editors in defining , redefining , then reredefining truth , sometimes hundreds of times a day . Take , for example , July 5 , 2006 , the day Enron embezzler Ken Lay died . At 10:06 A.M. that day , the Wikipedia entry about Lay said he died of an " apparent suicide . " Two minutes later , it said that the cause of death was an " apparent heart attack . " Then at 10:11 A.M. , Wikipedia reported that the " guilt of ruining so many lives finally led him to his suicide . " 4 At 10:12 , we were back to the massive coronary causing Lay ? s demise . And in February 2007 , just minutes after ex- Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith died in Florida , her Wikipedia page was flooded with conflicting , speculative versions of the cause of death . As Marshall Poe observed in the September 2006 issue of the Atlantic : // We tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . The fact that two plus two equals four is written in the stars ? But Wikipedia suggests a different theory of truth . Just think about the way we learn what words mean ? The community decides that two plus two equals four the same way it decides what an apple is : by consensus . Yes , that means that if the community changes its mind and decides that two plus two equals five , then two plus two does equal five . The community isn ? t likely to do such an absurd or useless thing , but it has the ability . ( 5 ) // In Orwell ? s Nineteen Eighty-Four , Big Brother insisted that two plus two equaled five , transforming a patently incorrect statement into the state-sanctioned , official truth . Today , as I discuss in Chapter 7 , there is potentially an even more threatening Big Brother lurking in the shadows : the search engine . We pour our innermost secrets into the all-powerful search engine through the tens of millions of questions we enter daily . Search engines like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our desires than our friends , our loved ones , and our shrink combined . But unlike in Nineteen Eighty - Four , this Big Brother is very much for real . We have to trust it not to spill our secrets-a trust , as we will see , that has repeatedly been betrayed . //
