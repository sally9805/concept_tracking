Of course , " Country Girl " wo n't have the impact of her faster , careening predecessor , but what 's a band to do after altering the face of modern pop  --  as Primal Scream did with its ' 91 landmark album , " Screamadelica , " which took the first-ever Mercury Prize that year and made rock fans warm to dance and techno beats . <p> Primal Scream has been here before , mining this ballsy Stones/Faces rock ' n ' roll , but 1994 's " Give Out but Do n't Give Up " was a bit of a strain , a forced exercise in big-game Genre Shifting . " Riot City Blues " is more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a needy declaration than a fun few nights getting sloppy in the studio . Midway through the disc , things get mired in Scream 's penchant for dilettante psychedelia ( like we need another London Suede ) , but it recovers with bloozy shouters like " The 99th Floor . " And catch the supporting cast : Echo &; the Bunnymen guitarist Will Sergeant on " When the Bomb Drops , " Dirty Three/Nick Cave violin saw doctor Warren Ellis on " Hell 's Comin ' Down . " <p> From " Country Girl , " we jump into the reeling boogie of " Nitty Gritty " ( dig ex-Felt master Martin Duffy 's swampy organ ! ) and the full-throttle , f-word packed tale of rockin ' junkies " Suicide Sally &; Johnny Guitar . " Caricatures ? Sure , but in era when rock ' n ' roll is basically a cartoon , another " Heavy Metal " does n't seem so grandiose . It 's OK to just have fun with this stuff every so often . <p> Thomas Conner <p> CLASSIC ROCK <p> Bob Seger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/2 <p> After a lengthy famine , Bob Seger 's fans can feast again . It 's been 11 years since the singer-songwriter released a new album , and " Face the Promise " delivers a hearty , satisfying plate full of the meat-and-potatoes rock that has made Seger 's <p> music a staple of soundtracks , classic-rock radio stations and the TV ad campaign for a certain manufacturer of American pickup trucks . <p> Unlike his contemporaries Paul Simon ( a great composer who is prone to artistic reinvention ) and Rod Stewart ( a raspy vocalist who has been flogging the Great American Songbook recently ) , Seger has stuck with his familiar strengths here . He has crafted a disc of straightforward , R &B-infused; rock that owes much to the sound of his classics from the ' 70s and ' 80s . Seger is a master of the graceful , melodic , mid-tempo ballad , and his new tunes " Wait for Me " and " The Long Goodbye " are among his finest compositions . <p> Seger has injected this album with lyrical substance , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " an earnest protest song with strings , compares the military situation in Iraq today with the events of Vietnam . " Between " comments on global warming , and " Are You " warns of the dangers of consumerism . The latter song is a bit too repetitious , but it is salvaged by lines like these : " Most of what we want is just illusion / Most of what we buy wo n't change a thing / Most of what we 're told is misdirection / Offered up to ease our suffering . " <p> Recorded mostly in Nashville with studio musicians , this album has numerous connections to the world of country music . Seger 's buddy Kid Rock drops by to wail on the duet " Real Mean Bottle , " a song that Vince Gill wrote about Merle Haggard . The always-reliable Patty Loveless duets with Seger on the disc 's most country-flavored tune , the sumptuous ballad " The Answer 's in the Question . " <p> Bobby Reed <p> POP-SOUL <p> Sam Moore , " Overnight Sensational " ( Rhino ) Rating 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not always an artistic success : Take one legend , hire a big-gun producer and surround the star with the biggest names you can find to perform on a couple of tracks . Even by those standards , this is grandiose  --  and it works . <p> The star is Sam Moore , half of the soul duo Sam &; Dave . The producer is Randy Jackson , the vaunted talent judge and dial twister for an impressive list of projects . And everybody wanted to sing with Sam : Wynonna , Bruce Springsteen , Jon Bon Jovi , Steve Winwood , Sting , Mariah Carey , etc . Just listen to the credits for the last track , " You Are So Beautiful " : the late Billy Preston , the co-author ; Eric Clapton ; Zucchero , and Robert Randolph , along with an equally impressive list of session players . <p> The material is surprisingly eclectic , ranging from Ann Peebles ' " I Ca n't Stand the Rain " to Conway Twitty 's " It 's Only Make Believe " to Garth Brooks ' " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore , singing like a soul man in the prime of life . <p> Jeff Johnson <p> ALT-ROCK <p> Ben Kweller , " Ben Kweller " ( ATO ) Rating 3 <p> The Lemonheads , " The Lemonheads " ( Vagrant ) H 1/2 <p> " Since 15 I have run everywhere you can run , " Ben Kweller sings in " Run , " the lead-off track to his latest , self-titled solo outing . He started running when he was 12 , really , forming the band Radish that wound up controversially signed to a major label when Kweller hit 15 . A decade on , if the E ! network docu-dramas and " Behind the Music " templates are to hold up , a childhood success like Kweller should be burned out , broke and robbing gas stations by now . But the beauty of this delicate alt-rocker is how easily he defies such expectations by producing great albums , each more thoughtful and well-written than the last . The line quoted above could have been sung as a jaded " the music industry 's been so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a small autobiographical note in a sweet plea for the object of his desire to run away with him . He 's got skills , see , and chicks dig guys with skills ... <p> Writing more and more at the piano , Kweller 's songs often are downright jaunty , a feeling that underpins their astonishingly innocent and sometimes child-like , not childish , nature ( witness " Penny on the Train Track "  --  indie-rock Nilsson ? ! ) . " I Do n't Know Why " is a hooky , jangly hit , the kind Matthew Sweet might have made back before he became so cynical . It 's beatiful balladry and rollicking rock ( softer here than usual , but still with teeth , especially on the second half ) produced by Gil Norton . <p> Five years ago , I saw Kweller open for Evan Dando , and the spry youngster blew the befuddled old man off the stage . Dando tried to control the situation by inviting Kweller to join him , playing the godfather , and it only made the differences starker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lemonheads out Sept. 26 ) have the same effect on each other . <p> The return of the Lemonheads is a noisy hangover , a modest embarrassment for those of us who once hailed Dando as our slacker king . Once dubbed by critic Ira Robbins as the " Peter Tork for Generation Slack , " Dando led a consistantly revolving lineup as the Lemonheads ; this one brings back bassist Karl Alvarez and drummer Bill Stevenson for a shoegaze-by-numbers set of power-pop chords and sheepish whining . " Become the Enemy " ( written by Stevenson ) is a great single that no doubt justified the production expenses for the record label , but it feels as if Dando has become the enemy , wringing the same tired moods out of grungy guitar scraping ( Dinosaur Jr . ' s J Mascis even joins on two songs ) . It sounds like a cover band at a college reunion  --  nice to see the familiar faces but , hoo-boy , you ready to go , honey ? <p> Thomas Conner <p> JAZZ <p> Ornette Coleman , " Sound Grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75-year-old ever sounded as buoyant as free jazz legend Ornette Coleman does on " Sound Grammar " ? Recorded live in Italy last year , it 's classic Ornette with a twist : His quartet includes two acousic bassists , one of whom , Greg Cohen , plucks his strings , while the other , Tony Falanga , bows his . Their contrasting tonalities and dramatic interplay proves a compelling foundation for Coleman 's spry , melodically pure alto saxophone solos  --  and trumpet solos that surpass his usual journeyman sound on that instrument ( he also dabbles on violin ) . <p> At this advanced stage in his remarkable career , Coleman is paring down songs more compellingly than ever , attaining a rare blend of beauty and power via his " harmolodic " approach ( it basically allows musicians to play independently of each other while remaining on the same page ) . The tunes , including remakes of " Turnaround " and " Song X , " can simultaneously pierce and soothe the senses . <p> This eagerly awaited disc , Coleman 's first in a decade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Denardo Coleman ( Ornette 's son ) is too far back in the mix and the bassists sometimes do n't have enough presence . But that 's a small concern in the face of music this great and this rare . <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> PROG ROCK <p> The Mars Volta , " Amputechture " ( GSL / Universal ) Rating 3 <p> " Amputechture " begins deceptively , with the uneasy blues of " Vicarious Atonement . " Rodriguez-Lopez evokes the sinewy , Latin fire of a young Carlos Santana , with a dash of Queen 's Brian May . Helium-pitched vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala walks a nightmarish landscape like a private eye from Rod Serling 's universe , seeking the face of his quarry " in a safe of dead tongues . " Such imagery is as indicative of The Mars Volta as its friction-burning guitar excursions . Psychedelic horrors unleashed during tracks like " Meccamputecture " evoke Edgar Allan Poe , Timothy Leary , William S. Burroughs and Yes ' Jon Anderson . <p> Unlike 2005 's " Frances the Mute " and 2003 's " De-Loused in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amputechture " follows no narrative . For music this challenging and non-linear , one less unifying factor can leave unprepared listeners standing in the dust . Fortunately , guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez occasionally leaves jagged edges of familiar touchstones . <p> During " Tetragrammaton , " prog-rock hallmarks including Steve Howe 's raw , sputtering intricacy and the mathematical repetition of King Crimson 's Robert Fripp protrude , as drummer Jon Theodore windmills through dizzying passages . If you can hold on , the ride is exhilarating . Prog 's heyday is long gone , but if justice prevails , Rodriguez-Lopez will someday be celebrated alongside his heroes . <p> Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante returns to guest on the salsa-spiked " Day of the Baphomets , " though the piece 's star is nimble bassist Juan Alderete de la Pena . The album 's most engaging rocker is the bilingual " Viscera Eyes , " which fuses Led Zeppelin 's " Immigrant Song , " Santana 's " Oye Como Va " and Yes ' " Heart of the Sunrise .
