From Lake Dreams : Chapter One His eyes were like jewels , aquamarines as deep and vivid as the sea , burning through the mist that enveloped him . They glittered down at her , the expression in them so intense that she was frightened , and struggled briefly in his grasp . He soothed her , his voice rough with passion as he controlled her struggles , stroking and caressing until she was once more quivering with delight , straining upward to meet him . His hips hammered rhythmically at her , driving deep . His powerful body was bare , his iron muscles moving like oiled silk under his sweaty skin . The mist from the lake swirled so thickly around them that she could n't see him clearly , could only feel him , inside and without , possessing her so fiercely and completely that she knew she would never be free of him . His features were lost in the mist , no matter how she strained her eyes to see him , no matter how she cried out in frustration . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had seen before , through other mists Thea jerked awake , her body quivering with the echo of passion ... and completion . Her skin was dewed with sweat , and she could hear her own breathing , coming hard and fast at first , then gradually slowing as her heartbeat settled into its normal pace . The dream always drained her of strength , left her wrung out and boneless from exhaustion . She felt shattered , unable to think , overcome by both panic and passion . Her loins throbbed as if she had just made love ; she twisted on the tangled sheets , pressing her thighs together to try to negate the sensation of still having him within her . Him . Nameless , faceless , but always him . She stared at the dim early-morning light that pressed against the window , a graying so fragile that it scarcely penetrated the glass . There was no need to look at the clock ; the dream always came in the dark , silent hour before dawn , and ended at the first approach of light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching for any possible comfort . Only a dream . But it was unlike any dream she 'd ever had before . She thought of it as a single dream , and yet the individual episodes were different . They it had begun almost a month before . At first she had simply thought of it as a weird dream , singularly vivid and frightening , but still only a dream . Then it had come again the next night . And the next . And every night since , until she dreaded going to sleep . She had tried setting her alarm to go off early , to head the dream off at the pass , so to speak , but it had n't worked . Oh , the alarm had gone off , all right ; but as she 'd been lying in bed grumpily mourning the lost sleep and steeling herself to actually get up , the dream had come anyway . She had felt awareness fade , had felt herself slipping beneath the surface of consciousness into that dark world where the vivid images held sway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it simply had n't been possible . Her heavy eyes had drifted shut , and he was there again ... He was angry with her , furious that she 'd tried to evade him . His long dark hair swirled around his shoulders , the strands almost alive with the force of his temper . His eyes ... oh , God , his eyes , as vivid as the dream , a hot blue-green searing through the clouds of mosquito netting that draped her bed . She lay very still , acutely aware of the cool linen sheets beneath her , of the heavy scents of the tropical night , of the heat that made even her thin nightgown feel oppressive ... and most of all of her flesh quivering in frightened awareness of the man standing in the night-shadowed bedroom , staring at her through the swath of netting . Frightened , yes , but she also felt triumphant . She had known it would come to this . She had pushed him , dared him , taunted him to this very outcome , this devil 's bargain she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And tonight he would become her lover . He came toward her , his warrior 's training evident in the grace and power of his every move . " You tried to evade me , " he said , his voice as dark as the evening thunder . His fury rippled around him , almost visible in its potency . " You played your games , deliberately arousing me to the mindlessness of a stallion covering a mare ... and now you dare try to hide from me ? I should strangle you . " She rose up on one elbow . Her heart was pounding in her chest , painfully thudding against her ribs , and she felt as if she might faint . But her flesh was awakening to his nearness , discounting the danger . " I was afraid , " she said simply , disarming him with the truth . He paused , and his eyes burned more vividly than before . " Damn you , " he whispered . " Damn both of us . " Then his powerful warrior 's hands were on the netting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The insubstantial wisp settled over her like a dream itself , and yet it still blurred his features , preventing her from seeing him clearly . His touch , when it came , wrenched a soft , surprised sound from her lips . His hands were rough and hot , sliding up her bare legs in a slow caress , lifting her nightgown out of the way . Violent hunger , all the more fierce for being unwilling , emanated from him as he stared at the shadowed juncture of her thighs . So it was to be that way , then , she thought , and braced herself . He intended to take her virginity without preparing her . So be it . If he thought he could make her cry out in pain and shock , he would be disappointed . He was a warrior , but she would show him that she was his equal in courage . He took her that way , pulled to the edge of the bed and with only her lower body bared , and the mosquito netting between them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her with a passion that seared her , with a completeness that marked her forever as his . And , in the end , she did cry out . That triumph was his , after all . But her cries were n't of pain , but of pleasure and fulfillment , and a glory she had n't known existed . That was the first time he 'd made love to her , the first time she 'd awakened still trembling from a climax so sweet and intense that she 'd wept in the aftermath , huddled alone in her tangled bed and longing for more . The first time , but definitely not the last . Thea got out of bed and walked to the window , restlessly rubbing her hands up and down her arms as she stared out at the quiet courtyard of her apartment building and waited for dawn to truly arrive , for the cheerful light to banish the lingering , eerie sense of unreality . Was she losing her mind ? Was this how insanity began , this gradual erosion of reality until one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Because the here and now was what did n't feel real to her anymore , not as real as the dreams that ushered in the dawn . Her work was suffering ; her concentration was shot . If she worked for anyone but herself , she thought wryly , she would be in big trouble . Nothing in her life had prepared her for this . Everything had been so normal , so Cleaverish . Great parents , a secure home life , two brothers who had , despite all earlier indications , grown up to be nice , interesting men whom she adored . Nothing traumatic had happened to her when she was growing up ; there had been the tedium of school , the almost suffocating friendships youngsters seem to need , the usual wrangles and arguments , and the long , halcyon summer days spent at the lake . Every summer , her courageous mother would pack the station wagon and bravely set forth to the summer house , where she would ride herd on three energetic kids for most of the summer . Her father would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vacation there , too . Thea remembered long , hot days of swimming and fishing , of bees buzzing in the grass , birdsong , fireflies winking in the dusk , crickets and frogs chirping , the plop of a turtle into the water , the mouthwatering smell of hamburgers cooking over charcoal . She remembered being bored , and fretting to go back home , but by the time summer would come again she 'd be in a fever to get back to the lake . If anything in her life was unusual , it was her chosen occupation , but she enjoyed painting houses . She was willing to tackle any paint job , inside or out , and customers seemed to love her attention to detail . She was also getting more and more mural work , as customers learned of that particular talent and asked her to transform walls . Even her murals were cheerfully normal ; nothing mystic or tortured there . So why had she suddenly begun having these weird time-period dreams , featuring the same faceless man , night after night after night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Marcus , and dressed as a Roman centurion . He was Luc , a Norman invader . He was Neill , he was Duncan ... he was so many different men she should never have been able to remember the names , and yet she did . He called her different names in the dreams , too : Judith , Willa , Moira , Anice . She was all of those women , and all of those women were the same . And he was always the same , no matter his name . He came to her in the dreams , and when he made love to her , he took more than her body . He invaded her soul , and filled her with a longing that never quite left , the sense that she was somehow incomplete without him . The pleasure was so shattering , the sensations so real , that when she had awakened the first time and lain there weeping , she had fearfully reached down to touch herself , expecting to feel the wetness of his seed . It had n't been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her mind . Her thirtieth birthday was less than a week away , and in all those years she had never felt as intensely about a real man as she did about the chimera who haunted her dreams . She could n't keep her mind on her work . The mural she 'd just finished for the Kalmans had lacked her customary attention to detail , though Mrs. Kalman had been happy with it . Thea knew it had n't been up to her usual standards , even if Mrs. Kalman did n't . She had to stop dreaming about him . Maybe she should see a therapist , or perhaps even a psychiatrist . But everything in her rebelled against that idea , against recounting those dreams to a stranger . It would be like making love in public . But she had to do something . The dreams were becoming more intense , more frightening . She had developed such a fear of water that , yesterday , she had almost panicked when driving over a bridge . She , who had always loved water sports of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now she had to steel herself to even look at a river or lake , and the fear was growing worse . In the last three dreams , they had been at the lake . Her lake , where she had spent the wonderful summers of her childhood . He had invaded her home turf , and she was suddenly more frightened than she could ever remember being before . It was as if he had been stalking her in her dreams , inexorably moving closer and closer to a conclusion that she already knew . Because , in her dreams , only sometimes did he make love to her . Sometimes he killed her .
