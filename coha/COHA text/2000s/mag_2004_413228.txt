A CHAT WITH JUDITH SILLS Headnote When it comes to work , chances are you 're either comfortably coasting , afraid to quit or just plain ignorant of the great gig you 've got , PT spoke with psychologist , author of The Comfort Trap , about summoning the courage to chart a new course . Photograph // Many people are simply afraid to look for another job in this economy . Does n't it make sense to waif for the market to pick up ? When anyone considers a job change , there will be rea-sons to stay put-the economy , your pension , being vested . Reasons always have a real element and an anxiety-avoiding element . Your strategy is to test reality by facing the anxiety ( are there really no new jobs ? ) . As you take action-write the resume , network-you will begin to assess your realistic limitations . You will also whittle down your anxiety . What if the anxiety is crippling ? Try to separate your anxiety from your ambition . Picture your fear sitting on your right shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an energy-it 's a counterpoint to anxiety . Reassure yourself that if you are allowed to dream , you may never decide to act . Dreaming , thinking-and then acting-will strengthen the vision and make you cower less behind anxiety . Thinking costs nothing . Do n't impulsively decide to quit and become a carpenter . just register for one woodworking course . You 're moving to the left but keeping the right in place . How do I find my focus and vision ? Start by formulating positive statements from general to aspecific : " I will have a job that interests me " to " I would be good in my own business . " Once you 've formed the statements , write them , repeat them and visualize your-self in a setting where you might live them . Visions grow in this kind of mental soil . Creative activity-journal keeping , a return to the violin-has a way of stirring vision . We lose parts of our-selves as we grow older . Reclaiming them can renew pos-sibilities . So can giving . When you do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , it will take you out of yourself , and at the most , it will return you to yourself . So we need to turn on the vision and turn down the anxiety . Break job change down to bite-size steps and never look past the next task . If you need to call three scary people for an interview , put all your energy into that first call . Also , volunteer for new tasks at your job and give yourself an opportunity to test your range in a safe envi-ronment . Try on a new identity at a volunteer job : You will feel less pressure because pay is not involved . Request a transfer at your current job or offer to train a new employee-you might get a larger vision of yourself . What can we learn from the divas , explorers and entre-preneurs who embrace change ? What do they have that the majority of us lack ? Juice , life force , X-factor-we are all born with it . Then , it 's tampered with because life is hard , we have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shyness and fear overwhelm this force , depression submerges it , rejection scars it and competition makes us uncertain about it . Photograph // But the person who acts with courage-to face down anxiety-has the great reward of knowing it can be done . And that person is more likely to do it again . And even when these risk takers fail-which they do plenty-they do n't die . This is true whether you 're batting your eyes at someone in a singles bar or going to the bank for a loan . You went in , they said you were stupid and you lived to tell the tale . Photograph Sills : " By leaving your comfort zone and putting your toe in the water , you 're stronger no matter the outcome . " // What if I have the desire and talent to design clothes but must hold down a desk job because I have four kids and am up to my neck in bills ? If your reason for doing nothing is that life got in the way-that 's a trap . We 're all living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most do n't . Nobody can write a book when she has a job , bills and kids . Except for the person who wrote the book while she had the job , bills and kids . Except Danielle Steele , who had nine kids . Maybe you have to take the design course on Saturdays and get up at 4:30 A.M. to do your sketches . Either you have that creative outlet or you have reasons . You say " reasons " but you mean " excuses . " We do n't call them excuses ; we call them reasons . So I call them reasons . People have reasons until they start having plans . You say " plan , " but you also mean " vision . " Yes , but I emphasize that vision can be just a whiff . Do you have any idea how you 're going to design clothes and make money ? No . Do you need to make a complete career change ? Not yet . Maybe you 'll sell T-shirts on the boardwalk and make a fortune . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term plan is nice ; it 's just not required . What if I have a good , creative job , say , making com-mercials , but I am driven to direct a meaningful film ? Well , is n't all of adulthood the narrowing of options ? No matter who you are there are only 24 hours in a day , and time is finite . So you have a choice to make . Often we say , " You can have the job and make your film on the side . " That 's nonsense . You may have to abandon the vision : " It 's going to require too much sacrifice of my career , and I 'm not going down that path . " Making these decisions is a requirement of adulthood . There are others who say , " I 've been taking care of my kids for a long time , and if I do n't make this film now , I never will . I 'm going to have to let go of this satisfying job , and that will be tough-maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cash in my 401(k) . " The third path : " Is there another cre-ative outlet that will satisfy me ? " For example , your hobby is filming important events in your friends ' lives . These mini-films are gifts of love for your friends . As ? culture , we do n't expect to derive as much satisfaction from work as we do from personal relationships . Is that why so many of us are stuck in profes-sional ruts ? We stay in jobs we do n't like , and we stay in relationships we do n't like . But we anticipate much more passionate excitement and bliss from a romantic relationship , while we are much more realistic about work . The myth that work should exalt the soul is far less rooted in our culture . In a job you know there is measurable reward : You know what you 're working for extrinsically ; who knows why you 're still in the relationship . What about those who say , " I make a decent living , I 'm just not on fire at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire to find intrinsic satisfaction at work . A job that offers social , intellectual or even physical satisfaction is one you may want to stay with . We do n't define a comfort trap by the degree of excite-ment in your work life but by the degree of satisfaction . Professional change is not something I recommend for its own sake . Rather , your job is a dead horse when it offers little or no satisfaction , when you 're only work-ing for the money , or you are enduring mind-numbing days or acute distress solely for that paycheck .
