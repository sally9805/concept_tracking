Excerpt from the Prologue // Back in the sixties , when I was appearing daily on NBC ? s Today show , I was living on Seventh Avenue and Fifty-seventh Street . My apartment was across from Carnegie Hall and on the corner of a very busy street . It was also near several large hotels that catered to businessmen . Perhaps because of this , the corner was the gathering place for some of the most attractive " ladies of the evening . " Each morning at five o ? clock I would emerge from my building wearing dark glasses , as I hadn ? t yet had my makeup done , and I was usually carrying a garment bag . It seemed obvious to the " ladies " that there was some big " number " I had just left . Now , bear in mind that , even then , I wasn ? t exactly a spring chicken . But I would emerge and look at the young ladies , some of whom were still teenagers . " Good morning , " I would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then I would get into this long black limousine with its uniformed driver , and we would glide off into the early morning light . And you know what effect all this had on the ladies ? // // I gave them hope . // Perhaps this book may do that for you . // So here it is , the whole package , from the beginning . //
