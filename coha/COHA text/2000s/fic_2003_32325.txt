Chapter 1THREE MEN watched intently as peculiar events occurred , one right after the other , on opposite sides of the globe . " What 's happening ? " asked the first , tall and dark skinned . " I do n't know , " replied the man with long black hair . " But wheels are turning , are n't they ? " " Things appear synchronized , " said the third man , compact and broad shouldered . " A pattern is emerging . Something great seems poised to happen . Something else lurks in the shadows . It seeks to devour the greatness before it is born . " " Two destinies are converging . But neither suspects it . " The tall one pointed toward a great palace in the distance . " He searches to find the right man for the right hour . Is this the hour ? Is this the man ? " " And if so , which man ? Or both ? We see far more clearly than they do . But still our minds are too small to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilled and the seeds planted twenty years ago , " the broad-shouldered man said . " No . A hundred years , at least . Now we will see what fruit the vine produces , or whether it will wither and die . " " Hanging in the balance are not just two men , " said the longhaired man , " but two families , perhaps two nations . " " Indeed , two worlds . " " The loss could be immense . Or the gain immeasurable . " His voice trembled . " We must watch closely as the tapestry is woven ... or as it unravels . " " We must do more than watch . " The tall man reached out one hand to the other two , who grasped it firmly , the muscles of their forearms taut . They now looked like warriors . " The stakes are high . " " Higher than they can possibly imagine . Higher than we ever dreamed when we walked that world . " v " Somebody 's got to make the tough calls , " Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else volunteering . " He picked up the phone from his oversized mahogany desk at the far side of his window office on the thirty-ninth floor of the U.S. Bancorp Tower . It was a bright September morning , and Oregon was the best place in the world to live in the fall , but he had more important things to do than admire the view . " Doug ? We need to talk . " " Sure , " said Doug Roberts from his desk in the sales department . " What 's up ? " " I have a management team meeting right now . Might take an hour . I 'll call you in when it 's over . Be sure you 're available . I 've got a conference call before lunch , and I wo n't have much time . " " Okay , Ben . But what do you want to talk about ? " " I 'll call you when I 'm ready . " Ben still gripped the phone tightly three seconds after he 'd finished talking . Finally he put it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's son . They 'd grown up on the East Coast , a few hundred miles apart . They 'd spent most holidays together , wrestling in the snow or exploring the beach or playing Parcheesi in front of the fire . Those were the days ... when life was simple , and loyalties easily maintained . Now they both worked in Portland , Oregon , on the opposite seaboard , for Getz International , a leading-edge multinational corporation . As a department head fifteen years ago , Ben had offered Doug a sales job , and he 'd jumped at it . They were both young and hungry back then . Doug had so much potential . Why had he forced his hand ? Once he 'd been an asset to Ben . Now he 'd become a liability . That Doug was family made it messy . Ben would probably have to skip the holiday gatherings this year . Doug had backed him into a corner . He had to send a clear message to all the employeesBen Fielding does n't tolerate insubordination , and he does n't play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His secretary 's voice over the intercom yanked Ben back to the moment . " They 're ready for you . " " On my way . " Ben stopped in front of the mirror on the back side of his office door , ran a comb through his hair , then straightened his Shanghai silk tie . He went to the door of the conference room , took a deep breath , and calculated his entrance . He walked in briskly but not too hurried . He stood tall and smiled pleasantly without grinning , a smile he 'd practiced in the mirror . Dressed in a black Armani with a boxy Italian fit , Ben Fielding was a self-made picture of style , poise , and competence . There were eight men in the room , and every eye was on him . " Hey , Ben , " Martin said , " we 're talking about that dream you spelled out for us ten years agoselling one of everything to a country of 1.2 billion people ! " Suddenly Martin 's broad smile evaporated . " Travis here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ben raised his eyebrows and stared at Travis . " The situation 's not stable , " Travis said , looking at his Palm Pilot instead of Ben . " I do n't trust that government . " " China wo n't be bullied by anyone , " Ben said . " That 's what Hong Kong was all about . And Macao . They wo n't let foreign devils ' control their destiny . What 's theirs is theirs . " " And what is n't theirs eventually will be , " Travis said . Ben shrugged . " I 'll say it again . If one nation dictates everybody 's future , it wo n't be America . It 'll be China . The sooner everybody comes to terms with that , the better we can position ourselves . " " One thing 's for sure , " Martin said ; " there 's not another semiconductor or microchip company with our access to Beijing and Shanghai . Between Ben and Jeffrey , we 've established one major beachhead . " Martin Getz , showing straight white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was CEO of Getz International . His father had started the company in 1979 , just before the computer revolution changed the world . " Okay , okay , guys . What 's the report on the Shanghai factory ? " " All indicators are positive , " Jeffrey said . " Production 's still going up . With socialism loosening its grip and workers getting more for their labor , there 's a new Chinese work ethic . Without all those paranoid safety and antipollution regulations , they get done in a week what takes us a monthand their Q.A . tallies are better . " " I do n't want to hear this , " Johnny said , his suit lapels flaring as he leaned back , playfully covering his ears . " There are certain things lawyers should n't know . " " We ca n't impose American standards on them , " Ben said . It was a mantra he 'd repeated at many team meetings . " And even if we could , we do n't have the right . But we can demand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These people are bright , smart , eager to work . They do n't know about unions ; they 're just grateful to make a living and be able to buy a refrigerator , a TV , maybe even a computer . " Ben 's confident voice commanded attention . There was a presence about him . Martin was the boss , but Ben was the brains and energy . Everyone knew it . " China 's still our fastest growing market ? " Martin asked . " In another few years they 'll be our biggest customerperiod , " Ben said . " China has a skyrocketing economy with hundreds of millions of residences that 'll add computers and a dozen other electronic devices in the next ten years . Dayton 's assembling the network cards in Mexico . They 'll ship direct from there to our joint-venture partnerships in-country and bypass China 's trade restrictions . It brings the end product cost down and gets it into more hands . Getz benefits inside China ; then we score again when it 's shipped back here at a fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution channels . Our competitors ' heads will be spinning . In the next few years they 'll be eating our dust . " " They 'll never catch up , " Martin said , all teeth again . " I wish I shared your confidence , " Travis said . " Seems to me we 're walking on a minefield . It 's a shaky economy . Human rights issues , overbuilding in Shanghai ... not to mention Beijing 's ability to pull the plug on anyone for any reason . " " It 's capitalists and communists scratching each other 's backs , " Ben said . " Sure , they 've got problems . They know the state-owned enterprises are inefficient , banks are folding , and pollution 's terrible . There 's still a lot of trial and error , but they 're learning fast . I 've been saying it since my first trip to BeijingChina 's our future , guys . It offers us the most cost-effective partnerships on the planet . And it 's a dream market come true . " " Just make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You too , Jeffrey . We do n't want them to get any ideas of doing it on their own . " " Oh , they 've got the ideas , alright , " Ben said . " They 're swimming in U.S. and Japanese technology , and they can imitate it like nobody else . Give them a decade , and they 'll be improving it . Eventually , they 'll be our strongest competitors . We 'll be racing to keep up . But meanwhile , we 've got the edge . Russia could n't handle free enterprise , but these people can . Their work ethic gets stronger every day , while ours gets weaker . Another six to eight years , and they 'll be putting America to shame . " Martin looked at Ben with undisguised admiration . " Ten years ago when you told us you could bring in millions of dollars if you studied Mandarin on company time , I thought you 'd gone crazy . But it worked . Boy , did it work ! They trust usyou and Jeffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . That 's our edge . " Martin stood up . " And I want to shore up that edge . I 've been chewing on an idea since that Fortune 500 CEO think tank I attended in Chicago a couple of months ago . " Martin looked around the room the way he always did before announcing an idea he was particularly proud of . Several of the men , including Ben , braced themselves . Nobody ever quite knew what Martin would come up with next . " I 'd like to send Ben or Jeffrey to spend maybe six weeks living among and talking with typical Chinese citizens , the type that might work in our factories and eventually buy our products . Ben , what about that old roommate of yours from college ? He lives in China , right ? A teacher , is n't he ? " Ben nodded . Li Quan 's youthful face invaded his mind and infused it with bittersweet memories . It was just like Martin to spring this on him with everybody watching . As it began to register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been twenty years since he ... " Getting inside the mind of the typical consumer would help our sales strategy and deepen our reservoir for those Chinese advertising campaigns that marketing 's been talking about . And it would be great PR on both sides of the ocean . We 'd be the company that sent a Mandarin- speaking VP to live with Chinese nationals to see what they 're like , to learn what they need . It 's the we care about the common man ' angle . It would impress the Chinese , our board , stockholderseverybody . A big image-booster for Getz . The advertising potential is enormous . Ben or Jeffrey could end up in a prime-time commercial sitting next to some Chinese guy grinning at his computer ! " The other members of the management team looked at each other to see which way the wind would blow . Then they all stared at Ben . He hesitated . But when Martin felt this strongly about an idea , it nearly always happened . You might as well go with him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more on that later , " Martin said . " Let 's hit the agenda . Our third-quarter profits are going to blow them away . When this hits Wall Street , things are going to fly . Hold on to your hats , boys . Your profit shares could increase ten percent overnight . " An hour later Ben walked out of the conference room , glad-handing his associates and feeling the warm rush of competitive adrenaline . As he came out the door , he saw Doug Roberts standing by a photocopy machine . His stomach churned . He looked at his watch . Conference call in six minutes . " Doug , " he called , " meeting 'll have to wait until Monday morning . My office , 7:30 . " " Sure . But what are we going to " " 7:30 Monday . My office . I 've got a conference call . " Ben strode past his secretary , Jen , and into his office . He shut the door behind him and flopped down on the plush visitors ' couch . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only family , but a close friend . Ben knew he could n't afford to think of him that way anymore . And if Doug still considered Ben a friend , well ... he would n't much longer .
