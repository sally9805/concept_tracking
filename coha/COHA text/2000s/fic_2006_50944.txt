The nosphere posited by Matthew Hughes is a grand form of a collective unconscious . We here at F &SF; sometimes feel our magazine is a similar sort of thing-an amalgamation of the dreams and nightmares of a small portion of the humans occupying this planet . The nightmares we receive say a bit about the anxieties and fears dogging people nowadays . Consider , for instance , this speculation ... <p> I. WHEN PAULA BECAME conscious of her surroundings againm , the first thing she sensed was his fingers entwined in hers . She was strapped to the ambulance backboard - each wrist cuffed in nylon , her chest held down by a wide band - to stop her from flailing and yanking out the IV . Only his presence kept her from screaming . He gazed down at her , dirty-blond hair hanging over blue eyes , pale cheeks shadowed by a few days " stubble . His love for her radiated like cool air from a block of ice . When they reached the hospital , he walked beside the gurney , his hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ER . Paula had never worked in the ER , but she recognized a few of the faces as she passed . She took several deep breaths , her chest tight against the nylon strap , and calmly told the paramedics that she was fine , they could let her go now . They made reassuring noises and left the restraints in place . Untying her was the doctor 's call now . Eventually an RN came to ask her questions . A deeply tanned , heavy-set woman with frosted hair . Paula could n't remember her name , though they 'd worked together for several years , back before the hospital had fired Paula . Now she was back as a patient . " And what happened tonight , Paula ? " the nurse said , her tone cold . They had n't gotten along when they worked together ; Paula had a temper in those days . " I guess I got a bit dizzy , " she said . " Seizure , " said one of the paramedics . " Red Cross guy said she started shaking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor before she fell off . She 'd been seizing for five or six minutes before we got there so we brought her in . We gave her point-one of Lorazepam and she came out of it during the ride . " " She 's the second epileptic this shift , " the nurse said to them . Paula blinked in surprise . Had one of the yellow house women been brought in ? Or one of the converts ? She looked to her side , and her companion gazed back at her , amused , but not giving anything away . Everything was part of the plan , but he would n't tell her what the plan was . Not yet . The nurse saw Paula 's shift in attention and her expression hardened . " Let 's have you talk to a doctor , Paula . " " I 'm feeling a lot better , " Paula said . Did n't even grit her teeth . They released the straps and transferred her to a bed in an exam room . One of the paramedics set her handbag on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . She glanced at the bag and quickly looked away . Best not to draw attention to it . " I 'm sorry if I was any trouble , " she said . The nurse handed her a clipboard of forms . " I do n't suppose I have to explain these to you , " she said . Then : " Is there something wrong with your hand ? " Paula looked down at her balled fist . She concentrated on loosening her fingers , but they refused to unclench . That had been happening more often lately . Always the left hand . " I guess I 'm nervous . " The nurse slowly nodded , not buying it . She made sure Paula could hold the clipboard and write , then left her . But not alone . He slouched in a bedside chair , legs stretched in front of him , the soles of his bare feet almost black . His shy smile was like a promise . I 'm here , Paula . I 'll always be here for you . II . Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed that CD first . He 'd moved out on a Friday , filed for divorce on the following Monday . He wanted custody of their daughter . Claire was ten then , a sullen and secretive child , but Paula would sooner burn the house down around them than let him have her . Instead she torched what he loved most . On the day Paula got the letter about the custody hearing , she pulled his CDs and LPs and DATs from the shelves-hundreds of them , an entire wall of the living room , and more in the basement . She carried them to the backyard by the box . Claire wailed in protest , tried to hide some of the cases , and eventually Paula had to lock the girl in her room . In the yard Paula emptied a can of lighter fluid over the pile , went into the garage for the gas can , splashed that on as well . She tossed the Nirvana CD on top . The pile of plastic went up in a satisfying whoosh . After a few minutes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay lit - so she went back into the house and brought out his books and music magazines . The pillar of smoke guided the police to her house . They told her it was illegal to burn garbage in the city . Paula laughed . " Damn right it 's garbage . " She was n't going to be pushed around by a couple of cops . Neighbors came out to watch . Fuck them , she thought . She lived in a neighborhood of Philadelphia that outsiders called " mixed . " Blacks and Latinos and whites , a handful of Asians and Arabs . Newly renovated homes with Mexican tile patios side by side with crack houses and empty lots . Paula moved there from the suburbs to be with Richard and never forgave him . Before Claire was born she made him install an alarm system and set bars across the windows . She felt like they were barely holding on against a tide of criminals and crazies . The yellow house women may have been both . They lived across the street and one lot down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Same fieldstone porch and peaked roofs , same narrow windows . But while Paula 's house was painted a tasteful slate blue , theirs blazed lemon yellow , the doors and window frames and gutters turned out in garish oranges and brilliant whites . Five or six women , a mix of races and skin tones , wandered in and out of the house at all hours . Did they have jobs ? They were n't old , but half of them had trouble walking , and one of them used a cane . Paula was an RN , twelve years working all kinds of units in two different hospitals , and it looked to her like they shared some kind of neuromuscular problem , maybe early MS . Their yellow house was probably some charity shelter . On the street the women seemed distracted , sometimes talking to themselves , until they noticed someone and smiled a bit too widely . They always greeted Paula and Richard , but they paid special attention to Claire , speaking to her in the focused way of old people and kindergarten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Steph who wore the prematurely weathered face of a long-time meth user , started stopping by more often in the months after Richard moved out . She brought homemade food : Tupperware bowls of bean soup , foil-wrapped tamales , rounds of bread . " I 've been a single mom , " she said . " I know how tough things can be on your own . " She started babysitting Claire a couple nights a week , staying in Paula 's house so Claire could fall asleep in her own bed . Some afternoons she took Claire with her on trips to the grocery or the park . Paula kept waiting for the catch . It finally came in the form of a sermon . " My life was screwed up , " Steph said to Paula one afternoon . Claire had vanished to her bedroom to curl up with her headphones . The two women sat in the kitchen eating cheese bread someone in the yellow house had made . Steph drank wine while Paula worked her way through her afternoon Scotch . Steph talked frankly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . " I was this close to cutting my wrists . If Jesus had n't come into my life , I would n't be here right now . " Here we go , Paula thought . She drank silently while Steph droned on about how much easier it was to have somebody walk beside her , someone who cared . " Your own personal Jesus , " Steph said . " Just like the song . " Paula knew the song-Richard loved that " 80s crap . He even had the Johnny Cash remake , until she 'd turned his collection to slag . " No thanks , " Paula said , " I do n't need any more men in my life . " Steph did n't take offense . She kept coming back , kept talking . Paula put up with the woman because with Richard out of the house she needed help with Claire-and because she needed her alone time more than ever . The yellow house women may have been Jesus freaks , but they were harmless . That 's what she told herself , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . III . Paula knew how to play the hospital game . Say as little as possible , act normal , do n't look at things no one else could see . She knew her blood tests would come out normal . They 'd shrug and check her out by noon . Her doctor surprised her , though . They 'd assigned her to Louden , a short , trim man with a head shaved down to gray stubble who had a reputation among the nurses for adequacy : not brilliant , but not arrogant either , a competent guy who pushed the patients through on schedule . But something had gotten into him - he was way too interested in her case . He filled her afternoon with expensive MRIs , fMRIs , and PET scans . He brought in specialists . Four of them , two neurologists and a psychiatrist she recognized , and one woman she did n't know who said she was an epidemiologist . They came in one at a time over the afternoon , asking the same questions . How long had she experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck ? Did she know others with these symptoms ? They poked her skin to test nerve response , pulled and flexed the fingers of her clenched hand . Several times they asked her , " Do you see people who are n't there ? " She almost laughed . He sat beside her the entire time , his arm cool against her own . Could anyone be more present ? The only questions that unsettled her came from the epidemiologist , the doctor she did n't recognize . " Do you eat meat ? " the doctor asked . Paula said sure . And the doctor , a square-faced woman with short brown hair , asked a dozen follow-up questions , writing down exactly what kinds of meat she ate , how often , whether she cooked it herself or ate out . At the end of the day they moved Paula into a room with a middleaged white woman named Esther Wynne , a true southern lady who 'd put on makeup and sprayed her hair as though at any moment she 'd pop those IV tubes from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louden stopped by once more before going home that night . He sat heavily beside Paula 's bed , ran a hand over his gray scalp . " You have n't been completely open with us , " he said . He seemed as tired as she was . " No , probably not , " she said . Behind him , her companion shook his head , laughing silently . Louden smiled as well , but fleetingly . " You have to realize how serious this is . You 're the tenth person we 've seen with symptoms like yours , and there are more showing up in hospitals around the city . Some of my colleagues think we may be seeing the start of an epidemic . We need your help to find out if that 's the case . " " Am I contagious ? " He scratched his chin , looked down . " We do n't think so . You do n't have a temperature , any signs of inflammation - no signs that this is a virus or a bacterial infection . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't have a firm idea yet , " he said . He was holding back , treating her like a dumb patient . " We can treat your symptoms though . We 'll try to find out more tomorrow , but we think you have a form of temporal lobe epilepsy . There are parts of your brain that - " " I know what epilepsy is . " " Yes , but TLE is a bit .... " He gestured vaguely , then took several stapled pages from his clipboard and handed them to her . " I 've brought some literature . The more you understand what 's happening , the better we 'll work together . " He did n't sound like he believed that . Paula glanced at the pages . Printouts from a web site . " Read it over and tomorrow you and I can - oh , good . " A nurse had entered the room with a plastic cup in her hand ; the meds had arrived . Louden seemed relieved to have something else to talk about . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want it , " she said . She was done with drugs and alcohol . " I would n't prescribe this if it was n't necessary , " Louden said . His doctor voice . " We want to avoid the spikes in activity that cause seizures like today 's . You do n't want to fall over and crack your skull open , do you ? " This clumsy attempt at manipulation would have made the old Paula furious . Her companion shrugged . It did n't matter . All part of the plan . Paula accepted the cup from the nurse , downed the two pills with a sip of water . " When can I go home ? " she said . Louden stood up . " I 'll talk to you again in the morning . I hate to tell you this , but there are a few more tests we have to run . " Or maybe they were keeping her here because they did think she was contagious . The start of an epidemic , he 'd said . Paula nodded understandingly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Why did that one doctor-Cerrhardt ? - ask me if late meat ? " He turned . " Dr. Gerrholtz . She 's not with the hospital . " " Who 's she with then ? " " Oh , the CDC , " he said casually . As if the Centers for Disease Control dropped by all the time . " Do n't worry , it 's their job to ask strange questions . We 'll have you out of here as soon as we can . " IV . Paula came home from work to find the door unchained and the lights on . It was only 7:15 , but in early November that meant it had been dark for more than hour . Paula stormed through the house looking for Claire . The girl knew the rules : come home from school , lock the door , and do n't pick up the phone unless caller-ID showed Paula 's cell or work number . Richard took her , she thought . Even though he won partial custody , he wanted to take everything from her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the counter between a stack of dishes and an open cereal box . The handwriting was Steph 's . Paula marched to the yellow house and knocked hard . Steph opened the door . " It 's all right , " Steph said , trying to calm her down . " She 's done her homework and now she 's watching TV . " Paula pushed past her into a living room full of second-hand furniture and faded rugs . Every light in the house seemed to be on , making every flat surface glow : the oak floors scrubbed to a buttery sheen , the freshly painted daffodil walls , the windows reflecting bright lozenges of white . Something spiced and delicious fried in the kitchen , and Paula was suddenly famished . She had n't eaten anything solid since breakfast . Claire sat on a braided oval rug , her purple backpack beside her . A nature show played on the small boxy TV but the girl was n't really watching . She had her earphones in , listening to the CD player in her lap . Lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her fifties or sixties . " Claire , " Paula said . The girl pretended to not hear . " Claire , take off your headphones when I 'm talking to you . " Her voice firm but reasonable . The Good Mother . " You know you 're not supposed to leave the house . " Claire did n't move . " The police were at the green house , " Steph said . A rundown place two doors down from Paula with motorcycles always in the front yard . Drug dealers , Paula thought . " I went over to check on Claire , and she seemed nervous , so I invited her over . I told her it would be all right . " " You would n't answer your phone , " Claire said without looking away from the TV . She still had n't taken off the headphones . Acting up in front of the women , thinking Paula would n't discipline her in public . " Then you keep calling , " Paula said . She 'd forgotten to turn on her phone when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink , not more than thirty , forty-five minutes , then came home , no later than she 'd come home dozens of times in the past . " You do n't leave the house . " Steph touched Paula 's elbow , interrupting again . She nodded at the woman on the couch . " This is Merilee . " The couch looked like the woman 's permanent home . On the short table next to her head was a half-empty water glass , a Kleenex box , a mound of damp tissue . A plastic bucket sat on the floor . Merilee lay propped up on pillows , her body half covered by a white sheet . Her legs were bent under her in what looked like a painful position , and her left arm curled up almost to her chin , where her hand trembled like a nervous animal . She watched the TV screen with a blissed-out smile , as if this was the best show in the world . Steph touched the woman 's shoulder , and she looked up . " Merilee , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right arm . Her aim was off ; first she held it out to a point too far right , then swung it slowly around . Paula lightly took her hand . Her skin was dry and cool . The woman smiled and said something in another language . Paula looked to Steph , and then Merilee said , " I eat you . " " I 'm sorry ? " She could n't have heard that right . " It 's a Fore greeting , " Steph said , pronouncing the word For-ay . " Merilee 's people come from the highlands of Papua New Guinea . Merilee , Paula is Claire 's mother . " " Yes , yes , you 're right , " Merilee said . Her mouth moved more than the words required , lips constantly twisting toward a smile , distorting her speech . " What a lovely girl . " It was n't clear if she meant Claire or Paula . Then her hand slipped away like a scarf and floated to her chest . She lay back and returned her gaze to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell 's the matter with her ? " We 're about to eat , " Steph said . " Sit down and join us . " " No , we 'd better get going , " Paula said . But there was nothing back at her house . And whatever they were cooking smelled wonderful . " Come on , " Steph said . " You always love our food . " That was true . She 'd eaten their meals for a month . " I just have a few minutes , " Paula said . She followed Steph into the dining room . The long , cloth-covered table almost filled the room . Ten places set , and room for a couple more . " How many of you are there ? " she said . " Seven of us live in the house , " Steph said as she went into the adjoining kitchen . " Looks like you 've got room for renters . " Paula picked a chair and sat down , eyeing the tall green bottle in the middle of the table . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink . " You 're way ahead of me , " Steph said . She came back into the room with the stems of wine glasses between her fingers , followed by an eighteen- or nineteen-year-old black girl - Tanya ? Tonya ? - carrying a large blue plate of rolled tortillas . Paula had met her before , pushing her toddler down the sidewalk . Outside she walked with a dragging limp , but inside it was barely discernible . Steph poured them all wine but then remained standing . She took a breath and held it . Still no one moved . " All right then , " Steph finally said , loud enough for Merilee to hear . Tonya - pretty sure it was Tonya - took a roll and passed the plate . Paula carefully bit into the tortilla . She tasted sour cream , a spicy salsa , chunks of tomato . The small cubes of meat were so heavily marinated that they could have been anything : pork , chicken , tofu . Tonya and Steph looked at Paula , their expressions neutral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of sour cream from her lip . " It 's very good , " she said . Steph smiled and raised her glass . " Welcome , " she said , and Tonya echoed her . Paula returned the salute and drank . The wine tasted more like brandy , thick and too sweet . Tonya nodded at her , said something under her breath . Steph said something to Merilee in that other language . Steph 's eyes , Paula noted with alarm , were wet with tears . " What is it ? " Paula said . She put down the cup . Something had happened that she did n't understand . She stared at the pure white tortillas , the glasses of dark wine . This was n't a snack , it was fucking communion . " Tell me what 's going on , " she said coldly . Steph sighed , her smile bittersweet . " We 've been worried about you . Both of you . Claire 's been spending so much time alone , and you 're obviously still grieving . " Paula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , some kind of religious intervention ? " My life is none of your business . " " Claire told me that you 've been talking about killing yourself . " Paula scraped her chair back from the table and stood up , her heart racing . Tonya looked at her with concern . So smug . " Claire told you that ? " Paula said . " And you believed her ? " " Paula .... " She wheeled away from the table , heading for the living room , Steph close behind . " Claire , " Paula said . Not yelling . Not yet . " We 're going . " Claire did n't get up . She looked at Steph , as if for permission . This infuriated Paula more than anything that had happened so far . She grabbed Claire by her arm , yanked her to her feet . The headphones popped from her ears , spilling tinny music . Claire did n't even squeak . Steph said , " We care about you two , Paula . We had to take steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " Paula spun and slapped the woman hard across the mouth , turning her chin with the blow . Steph 's eyes squeezed shut in pain , but she did n't raise her arms , did n't step back . " Do n't you ever come near my daughter again , " Paula said . She strode toward the front door , Claire scrambling to stay on her feet next to her . Paula yanked open the door and pushed the girl out first . Her daughter still had n't made a sound . Behind her , Steph said , " Wait . " She came to the door holding out Claire 's backpack and CD player . " Some day you 'll understand , " Steph said . " Jesus is coming soon . " V. " You 're a Christian , are n't you ? " Esther Wynne said . " I knew from your face . You 've got the love of Jesus in you . " As the two women picked at their breakfast trays , Esther told Paula about her life . " A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I 've had time to say good-bye to everyone . " Her cancer was in remission but now she was here fighting a severe bladder infection . They 'd hooked her to an IV full of antibiotics the day before . " How about you ? " Esther said . " What 's a young thing like you doing here ? " Paula laughed . She was thirty-six . " They think I have a TLA . " Esther frowned . " Three-letter acronym . " " Oh , I 've got a couple of those myself ! " One of the web pages Dr. Louden gave her last night included a cartoon cross-section of a brain . Arrows pointed out interesting bits of the temporal lobe with tour guide comments like " the amygdala tags events with emotion and significance " and " the hippocampus labels inputs as internal or external . " A colored text box listed a wide range of possible TLE symptoms : euphoria , a sense of personal destiny , religiosity ... And a sense of presence . Asymmetrical temporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one twin in each hemisphere . The dominant ( usually left ) hemisphere interprets the other part of the self as an " other " lurking outside . The otherness is then colored by which hemisphere is most active . Paula looked up then , her chest tight . Her companion had been leaning against the wall , watching her read . At her frightened expression he dropped his head and laughed silently , his hair swinging in front of his face . Of course . There was nothing she could learn that could hurt her , or him . She tossed aside the pages . If her companion had n't been with her she might have worried all night about the information , but he helped her think it through . The article had it backward , confusing an effect for the cause . Of course the brain reacted when you sensed the presence of Cod . Neurons fired like pupils contracting against a bright light . " Paula ? " someone said . " Paula . " She blinked . An LPN stood by the bed with a plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long had she been ruminating ? " Sorry , I was lost in thought there . " The nurse handed Paula the Topamax and watched as she took them . After the required ritual - pulse , blood pressure , temperature - she finally left . Esther said , " So what were you thinking about ? " Paula lay back on the pillows and let her eyes close . Her companion sat beside her on the bed , massaging the muscles of her left arm , loosening her cramped fingers . " I was thinking that when God calls you do n't worry about how he got your number , " she said . " You just pick up the receiver . " " A-men , " Esther said . DR . LOUDEN STOPPED BY later that morning accompanied only by Dr. Gerrholtz , the epidemiologist from the CDC . Maybe the other specialists had already grown bored with her case . " We have you scheduled for another PET scan this morning , " Louden said . He looked like he had n't slept at all last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call to be with you ? A family member ? " " No thank you , " Paula said . " I do n't want to bother them . " " I really think you should consider it . " " Do n't worry , Dr. Louden . " She wanted to pat his arm , but that would probably embarrass him in front of Dr. Gerrholtz . " I 'm perfectly fine . " Louden rubbed a hand across his skull . After a long moment he said , " Are n't you curious about why we ordered a PET scan ? " Dr. Gerrholtz gave him a hard look . Paula shrugged . " Okay , why did you ? " Louden shook his head , disappointed again that she was n't more concerned . Dr. Gerrholtz said , " You 're a professional , Paula , so we 're going to be straight with you . " " I appreciate that . " " We 're looking for amyloid plaques . Do you know what those are ? " Paula shook her head and Gerrholtz said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a plaque that kills cells . Alzheimer patients get them , but they 're also caused by another family of diseases . We think those plaques are causing your seizures , and other symptoms . " Other symptoms . Her companion leaned against her shoulder , his hand entwined in hers . " Okay , " Paula said . Louden stood up , obviously upset . " We 'll talk to you after the test . Dr. Gerrholtz ? " The CDC doctor ignored him . " We 've been going through the records , Paula , looking for people who 've reported symptoms like yours . " She said it like a warning . " In the past three months we 've found almost a dozen - and that 's just at this hospital . We do n't know yet how many we 'll find across the city , or the country . If you have any information that will help us track down what 's happening , you need to offer it . " " Of course , " Paula said . Gerrholtz 's eyes narrowed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head and stalked from the room . Esther watched her go . After a minute of silence , the woman said , " Do n't you worry , honey . It 's not the doctors who are in charge here . " " Oh I 'm not worried , " Paula said . And she was n't . Gerrholtz obviously distrusted her - maybe even suspected the nature of Paula 's mission - but what could that matter ? Everything was part of the plan , even Dr. Gerrholtz . By noon they still had n't come to get her for the scan . Paula drifted in and out of sleep . Twice she awoke with a start , sure that her companion had left the room . But each time he appeared after a few seconds , stepping out from a comer of her vision . The orderly came by just as the lunch trays arrived , but that was okay , Paula was n't hungry . She got into the wheelchair and the orderly rolled her down the hall to the elevators . Her companion walked just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orderly parked her in the hall outside radiology , next to three other abandoned patients : a gray-faced old man asleep in his chair ; a Hispanic teenager with a cast on her leg playing some electronic game ; and a round-faced white boy who was maybe twenty or twenty-one . The boy gazed up at the ceiling tiles , a soft smile on his face . After a few minutes , Paula saw his lips moving . " Excuse me , " Paula said to him . It took several tries to get his attention . " Have you ever visited a yellow house ? " The young man looked at her quizzically . " A house that was all yellow , inside and out . " He shook his head . " Sorry . " None of the women still at the yellow house would have tried to save a man , but she had to ask . The boy had to be one of the converts , someone Paula 's mission had saved . " Can I ask you one more question ? " Paula said , dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the girl still seemed engrossed in her game . " Who is it that you 're talking to ? " The boy glanced up , laughed quietly . " Oh , nobody , " he said . " You can tell me , " Paula said . She leaned closer . " I have a companion of my own . " His eyes widened . " You have a ghost following you too ? " " Ghost ? No , it 's not a - " " My mother died giving birth to me , " he said . " But now she 's here . " Paula touched the boy 's arm . " You do n't understand what 's happened to you , do you ? " He had n't come by way of the yellow house , had n't met any of the sisters , had n't received any instruction . Of course he 'd tried to make sense of his companion any way he could . " You 're not seeing a ghost . You 're seeing Jesus himself . " The boy laughed loudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think I 'd know the difference between Jesus and my own mother , " the young man said . " Maybe that 's why he took this form for you , " Paula said . " He appears differently for each person . For you , your mother is a figure of unconditional love . A person who sacrificed for you . " " Okay , " the young man said . He tilted his head , indicating an empty space to Paula 's right . " So what does yours look like ? " VI . God came through the windshield on a shotgun blast of light . Blinded , Paula cried out and jammed on the brakes . The little Nissan SUV bucked and fishtailed , sending the CDs piled on the seat next to her clattering onto the floorboards . White . She could see nothing but white . She 'd stopped in heavy traffic on a four-lane road , the shopping center just ahead on her right . She 'd been heading for the dumpsters behind the Wal-Mart to dispose of those CDs once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically , clenched against the pending impact , eyes screwed shut . ( Still : Light . Light . ) A thunderclap of metal on metal and the SUV rocked forward . She jerked in her seatbelt . Paula opened her eyes and light scraped her retinas . Hot tears coursed down her cheeks . She clawed blindly at her seatbelt buckle , hands shaking , and finally found the button and yanked the straps away . She scrambled over the shifter to the passenger seat , the plastic CD cases snapping and sliding under her knees and palms . She 'd found them deep in Claire 's closet . The girl was away at her father 's for the mandated fifty percent of the month , and Paula had found the stacked CDs hidden under a pile of blankets and stuffed animals . Many of the cases were cracked and warped by heat and most CDs had no cases at all . The day after the bonfire , Paula had caught the girl poking through the mound of plastic and damp ashes and told her not to touch them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime before the garbage men took the pile away . The deception had gone on for months . All the time Paula thought Claire was listening to her own music - crap by bubble-gum pop stars and American Idols - her headphones were full of her father 's music : Talking Heads , Depeche Mode , Pearl Jam , Nirvana . Paula pushed open the passenger door and half fell out the door , into the icy March wind . She got her feet under her , stumbled away from the light , into the light . Her shins struck something - the guard rail ? - and she put out a hand to stop from pitching over . Cold metal bit her palms . Far to her right , someone shouted angrily . The blare and roar of traffic surrounded her . Paula dropped to her knees and slush instantly soaked her jeans . She covered her head with both arms . The light struck her neck and back like a rain of sharpened stones . The light would destroy her . Exactly as she deserved . Something touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shame and a rising ecstasy that had nothing to do with sex . She began to shake , to weep . I 'm sorry , she said , perhaps out loud . I 'm sorry . Someone stood beside her . She turned her head , and he appeared out of the light . No - in the light , of the light . A fire in the shape of a man . She did n't know him , but she recognized him . He looked down at her , electric blue eyes through white bangs , his shy smile for her only . He looked like Kurt Cobain . VII . " I 'm not taking the meds anymore , " Paula said . She tried to keep her voice steady . Louden stood beside the bed , Gerrholtz behind him holding a portfolio in her hands as big as the Ten Commandments . They 'd walked past Esther without saying a word . Her companion lay on the floor beside her bed , curled into a ball . He seemed to be dissolving at the edges , dissipating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely moving , not even looking at her . " That 's not a good idea , " Dr. Louden said . He pulled a chair next to the bed , scraping through her companion as if he was n't there . Paula grimaced , the old rage flaring up . She closed her eyes and concentrated . " I 'm telling you to stop the drugs , " she said . " Unless I 'm a prisoner here you ca n't give me medicine that I refuse . " Louden exhaled tiredly . " This is n't like you , Paula , " he said . " Then you do n't know me very well . " He leaned forward , resting elbows on knees , and pressed the fingers of one hand into his forehead . More TLE patients were rolling in every day . The nurses murmured about epidemics . Poor Dr. Adequate had been drafted into a war he did n't understand and was n't prepared for . " Help me then , " he said without looking up . " Tell me what you 're experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling . She left it on all the time now , sound off . The images distracted her , kept her from thinking of him on the floor beside her , fading . Gerrholtz said , " Why do n't I take a guess ? You 're having trouble seeing your imaginary friend . " Paula snapped her head toward the woman . You bitch . She almost said it aloud . Gerrholtz regarded her coolly . " A woman died two days ago in a hospital not far from here , " she said . " Her name was Stephanie Wozniak . I 'm told she was a neighbor of yours . " Steph is deadl She could n't process the thought . Gerrholtz took the sheets from her portfolio and laid them on Paula 's lap . " I want you to look at these . " Paula picked them up automatically . The photographs looked like microscope slides from her old biochem classes , a field of cells tinged brown by some preserving chemical . Spidery black asterisks pock-marked the cells . " Those clumps of black are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old proteins , with one difference - they 're the wrong shape . " Paula did n't look up . She flipped the printouts one by one , her hand moving on its own . Some of the pictures consisted almost entirely of sprawling nests of black threads . Steph deserved better than this . She 'd waited her whole life for a Fore funeral . Instead the doctors cut her up and photographed the remains . " I need you to concentrate , Paula . One protein bent or looped in the wrong way is n't a problem . But once they 're in the brain , you get a conformational cascade - a snowball effect . " Paula 's hands continued to move but she 'd stopped seeing them . Gerrholtz rattled on and on about nucleation and crystallization . She kept using the word spongiform as if it would frighten her . Paula already knew all this , and more . She let the doctor talk . Above Gerrholtz 's head the TV showed a concerned young woman with a microphone , police cars and ambulances in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rigid with anger . Paula wondered if that was what she used to look like when she fought with Richard or screamed at Claire . " I noticed you avoided saying " Mad Cow , ' " Paula said . " And Kuru . " " You know about Kuru ? " Louden said . " Of course she does , " Gerrholtz said . " She 's done her homework . " The doctor put her hands on the foot of Paula 's bed and leaned forward . " The disease that killed Stephanie does n't have a name yet , Paula . We think it 's a Kuru variant , the same priori with an extra kink . And we know that we ca n't save the people who already have it . Their prions will keep converting other proteins to use their shape . You understand what this means , do n't you Paula ? " Still trying to scare her . As if the promise of her own death would break her faith . On the screen , the reporter gestured at two uniformed officers sealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to match the house . Paula wondered if they 'd found Merilee yet . " It means that God is an idea , " Paula said . " An idea that ca n't be killed . " VIII . The house shimmered in her vision , calling her like a lighthouse ; she understood now why they 'd painted it so brightly . Minutes after the accident her vision darkened like smoked glass , and now only the brightest things drew her attention . Her companion guided her down the dark streets , walking a few feet in front of her , surrounded by a nimbus of fire . Steph opened the door . When she saw the tears in her eyes Steph squealed in delight and pulled her into a hug . " We 've been waiting for you , " she said . " We 've been waiting so long . " And then Steph was crying too . " I 'm sorry , " Paula said . " I 'm so sorry . I did n't know .... " The other women came to her one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them crying . Only Merilee could n't get up to greet her . The woman lay on the same couch as four months ago , but her limbs had cinched tighter , arms and legs curled to her torso like a dying bug . Paula kneeled next to her couch and gently pressed her cheek to Merilee 's . Paula spoke the Fore greeting : I eat you . That was the day one life ended and another began . Her vision slowly returned over the next few days , but her companion remained , becoming more solid every day . They told her she did n't have to worry about him leaving her . She called in sick to work and spent most of the next week in the yellow house , one minute laughing , the next crying , sometimes both at the same time . She could n't stop talking about her experience on the road , or the way her companion could make her recognize her vanity or spite with just a faint smile . Her old life had become something that belonged to a stranger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the screaming matches with Richard . Had she really burned his record collection ? When she called him , the first thing she said was , " I 'm sorry . " " What is it , Paula . " His voice flat , wary . The Paula he knew only used " sorry " to bat away his words , deflect any attack . " Something wonderful 's happened , " she said . She told him about Steph and the women of the house , then skipped the communion to tell him about the accident and the blinding light and the emotions that flooded through her . Richard kept telling her to slow down , stop stumbling over her words . Then she told him about her companion . " Who did you meet ? " he said . He thought it was someone who 'd witnessed the accident . Again she tried to explain . Richard said , " I do n't think Claire should come back there this weekend . " " What ? No ! " She needed to see Claire . She needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gripped the receiver . Why could n't Richard believe her ? Why was he fighting her again ? She felt a touch on the back of her head . She turned , let her hand fall to the side . His blue eyes gazed into hers . One eyebrow rose slightly . She breathed . Breathed again . Richard called her name from the handset . " I know this is a lot to adjust to , " Paula said . The words came to her even though her companion did n't make a sound . " I know you want the best for Claire . You 're a good father . " The words hurt because they were true . She 'd always thought of Richard as a weak man , but if that had once been true , Claire 's birth had given him someone weaker to protect . As their daughter became older he took her side against Paula more and more often . The fights worsened , but she broke him every time . She never thought he 'd have the guts to walk out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you think she 'd be better off with you for a while , we can try that . " She 'd win his trust soon enough . In the weeks after , Claire stayed with Richard , and Paula did hardly anything but talk with the yellow house women . At work the head nurse reprimanded her for her absences but she did n't care . Her life was with the women now , and her house became almost an annex to theirs . " We have room for more , " Paula said dozens of times . " We have to tell others . It 's not right to keep this to ourselves when so many people are suffering . " The women nodded in agreement-or perhaps only in sympathy . Each of them had been saved , most of them from lives much worse than Paula 's . They knew what changes were possible . " You have to be patient , " Steph told her one day . " This gift is handed from woman to woman , from Merilee 's grandmother down to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to choose carefully - we ca n't share it with everyone . " " Why not ? " Paula said . " Most of us would be dead without it . We 're talking about saving the world here . " " Yes . One person at a time . " " But people are dying right now , " Paula said . " There has to be a way to take this beyond the house . " " Let me show you something , " Steph said . She brought down a box from a high bookshelf and lifted out a huge family bible . Steph opened it to the family tree page , her left hand trembling . " Here are some of your sisters , " she said . " The ones I 've known anyway . " The page was full of names . The list continued on the next page , and the next . Over a hundred names . " How long has this been going on ? " Paula said in wonder . " Merilee 's mother came here in 1982 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , and then were sent to establish their own houses . We do n't know how many of us there are now , spread around the country . None of us knows all of them . " She smiled at her . " See ? You 're not so alone . But we have to move quietly , Paula . We have to meet in small groups , like the early Christians . " " Like terrorists , " Paula said bitterly . Steph glanced to the side , listening to her companion . " Yes , " she said , nodding . And then to Paula : " Exactly . There 's no terror like the fear of God . " IX . He woke her at three A.M. Paula blinked at him , confused . He hovered beside the bed , only half there , like a reflection in a shop window . She forced herself awake and as her vision cleared the edges of him resolved , but he was still more vapor than solid . " What is it ? " she said . He teasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bed . He paused , waiting for her . Paula slipped out of the bed and moved quietly to the cabinet against the wall . The door came open with a loud clack , and she froze , waiting to see if she 'd awakened her roommate . Esther 's feathery snore came faint and regular . Paula found her handbag at the bottom shelf and carried it to the window . Feeling past her wallet fat with ID cards , she pulled out the smaller vinyl case and laid it open on the sill like a butterfly . The metal tip of the syringe reflected the light . Paula made a fist of her left hand , flexed , tightened again . Working in the faint light , she found the vein in her arm mostly by feel and long familiarity , her fingertips brushing first over the dimpled scars near the crook of her elbow , then down half an inch . She took the syringe in her right hand and pressed into the skin . The plastic tube slowly filled . Paula picked her way through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside Esther 's bed . The woman lay still , her lips slightly apart , snoring lightly . It would be simple to inject the blood through the IV 's Y-port . But what if it was too late for her ? The host incubated for three to six months . Only if the cancer stayed in remission that long would the woman have a chance to know God . Not her invisible , unseen God . The real thing . Paula reached for the tubing and her companion touched her arm . She lowered the syringe , confused . Why not inject her ? She searched his face . for a reason , but he was so hard to see . He turned and walked through the wall . Paula opened the door and stepped into the bright hallway , and for a moment she could n't find him in the light . He gestured for her to follow . She followed his will-o ' - the- wisp down the deserted corridor , carrying the syringe low at her side . He led her down the stairwell , and at the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a staffer in blue scrubs passed ten feet in front of them without seeing them . Perhaps she 'd become invisible too . He stopped before a door and looked at her . It was one of the converted rooms where doctors on call could catch some sleep . Here ? she asked with her eyes . He gestured toward the door , his arm like a tendril of fog . She gripped the handle , slowly turned . The door was unlocked . Gently , she pushed it open . The wedge of light revealed a woman asleep on the twin bed , a thin blanket half covering her . She wore what Paula had seen her in earlier : a cream blouse gleaming in the hall light , a patterned skirt rucked above her knees , her legs dark in black hose . Her shoes waited side-by-side on the floor next to the bed , ready for her to spring back into action and save her world . Paula looked back at the doorway . Dr. Gerrholtz ? she asked him . Did he really want this awful woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest of frowns , and Paula felt a rush of shame . Who was she to object ? Before Steph had found her Paula had been the most miserable woman alive . Everyone deserved salvation . That was the whole point of the mission . Dr. Gerrholtz stirred , turned her head slightly , and the light fell across her closed eyes . Paula raised the needle , moved her thumb over the plunger . No handy IV already connected . No way to do this without waking the woman up . And she 'd wake up screaming . " Hello ? " Dr. Gerrholtz said . Her eyes opened , and she lifted a hand to shade her eyes . Jesus is coming , Paula said silently , and pressed the needle into her thigh . X. Paula and Tonya stooped awkwardly at the edge of the pit , clearing the sand . They dug down carefully so that their shovel blades would n't cut too deep , then pitched the spark-flecked sand into the dark of the yard . They worked in short sleeves , sweating despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew hotter and brighter . It was hard work , and their backs still ached from this morning when they 'd dug the pit , hauled over the big stones , and lined the bottom with them . But Paula had volunteered for this job . She wanted to prove that she could work harder than anyone . Inside the house , women laughed and told stories , their voices carrying through the half-opened windows . Paula tossed aside a shovelful of sand and said , " Tonya , have you ever asked why no men are invited ? " She 'd thought about her words for a long time . She wanted to test them on Tonya first , because she was young and seemed more open than the other women . Tonya looked up briefly , then dug down again with her shovel . " That 's not the tradition . " " But what about Donel ? Would n't you want this for him ? " Donel was Tonya 's son , only two years old . He shared a bedroom with her , but all the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shovel . " I ... I think about that . But it 's just not the way it 's done . No men at the feast . " " But what if we could bring the feast to them ? " Paula said . " I 've been reading about Merilee 's people , the disease they carried . There 's more than one way to transmit the host . What if we could become missionaries some other way ? " The girl shook her head . " Merilee said that men would twist it all up , just like they did the last time . " " All the disciples were men last time . This time they 're all women , but that does n't make it right . Think about Donel . " Think about Richard . " We better keep going , " Tonya said , ending the conversation . She started digging again , and after a moment , Paula joined her . But she kept thinking of Richard . He 'd become more guarded over the past few months , more protective of Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rules-Paula would bring her to communion . But if she could also bring it to Richard , if he could experience what she 'd found , they could be a family again . Several minutes later they found the burlap by the feel under their shovels . They scraped back the sand that covered the sack , then bent and heaved it up onto a pallet of plywood and one-by-fours . After they 'd caught their breath they called the others from the house . More than seventy women had come , some of them from as far away as New Zealand . None of them had come alone , of course . The air was charged with a multitude of invisible presences . Eight of the women were chosen as pall bearers . The procession moved slowly because so many of them walked with difficulty . God 's presence burned the body like a candle - Merilee 's early death was proof of that - but not one of them would trade Him for anything . A perfect body was for the next life . Steph began to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , harmonizing . Some knew the words ; others , like Paula , hummed along . Women cried , laughed , lifted their hands . Others walked silently , perhaps in communion with their companions . There was an awkward moment when they had to tilt the litter to get through the back door , but then they were inside . They carried her though the kitchen - past the stacks of Tupperware , the knives and cutting boards , the coolers of dry ice-then through the dining room and into the living room . The furniture had been pushed back to the walls . They set the litter in the center of the room . Paula gripped the stiff and salt-caked cloth-they 'd soaked the body overnight-while Steph sawed the length of it with a thick-bladed knife . Steam escaped from the bag , filling the room with a heady scent of ginger and a dozen other spices . The last of the shroud fell away and Merilee grinned up at them . Her lips had pulled away from her teeth , and the skin of her face had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd packed ferns and wild herbs around her in a funeral dress of leaves . Steph kneeled at the head of the impromptu table and the others gathered around . The oldest and most crippled were helped down to the floor ; the rest stood behind them , hands on their shoulders . Steph opened a wooden box as big as a plumber 's toolbox and drew out a small knife . She laid it on a white linen napkin next to Merilee 's skull and said , " Like many of you I was at the feast of Merilee 's mother , and this is the story Merilee told there . " It was the tradition of the Fore for the men and women to live apart . When a member of the tribe died , only the women and children were allowed at the feast . The men became jealous . They cursed the women , and they called the curse kuru , which means both " to tremble " and " to be afraid . " The white missionaries who visited the tribe called the laughing sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As she talked she laid out other tools from the box : a filet knife , a wooden-handled fork with long silver tines , a Japanese cleaver . " Merilee 's grandmother , Yobaiotu , was a young woman when the first whites came , the doctors and government men and missionaries . One day the missionaries brought everyone out to the clearing they 'd made by the river and gave everyone a piece of bread . They told them to dip it into a cup of wine and eat , and they said the words Jesus had spoken at the last supper : This is my body , this is my blood . " Steph drew out a long-handled knife and looked at it for perhaps thirty seconds , trying to control her emotions . " The moment Yobaiotu swallowed the bread , she fell down shaking , and a light filled her eyes . When she awoke , a young boy stood at her side . He held out his hand to her , and helped her to her feet . " Lord Jesus ! " Yobaiotu said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But of course no one else could see him . They thought she was crazy . " The women quietly laughed and nodded . " The doctors said that the funeral feasts caused Kuru , and they ordered them to stop . But Yobaiotu knew the curse had been transformed in her , that the body of Christ lived in her . She taught her daughters to keep that covenant . The night Yobaiotu died they feasted in secret , as we do tonight . " Steph removed the center shelf of the box , set it aside , and reached in again . She lifted out a hacksaw with a gleaming blade . A green price tag was still stuck to the saw 's blue handle . " The body of Christ was passed from mother to daughter , " Steph said . " Because of them , Christ lives in all of us . And because of Merilee , Christ will live in sisters who 've not yet been found . " " Amen , " the women said in unison . Steph lifted the saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merilee 's skull . " This we do in remembrance of him , " she said . " And Merilee . " XI . The screaming eventually brought Louden to her room . " Do n't make me sedate you , " he began , and then flinched as she jerked toward him . The cuffs held her to the bed . " Bring him back ! " she screamed , her voice hoarse . " Bring him back now ! " Last night they 'd taken her to another room , one without windows , and tied her down . Arms apart , ankles together . Then they attached the IV and upped the dosage : two parts Topamax , one pan Loxapine , an antipsychotic . Gerrholtz they rushed to specialists in another city . A hospital security guard took up station outside her door , and was replaced the next morning by a uniformed police officer . Detectives came to interrogate her . Her name had n't been released to the news , they said , but it would only be a matter of time . The TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responding to stories coming out of the yellow house investigation - but already they 'd started using the word " bioterrorism . " Sometime today they 'd move her to a federal facility . Minute by minute the drugs did their work and she felt him slipping from her . She thought , if I keep watch he ca n't disappear . By twisting her shoulders she could see a little way over the bed and make out a part of him : a shadow that indicated his blue-jeaned leg , a cluster of dots in the speckled linoleum that described the sole of a dirty foot . When the cramps in her arms and lower back became too much she 'd fall back , rest for a while , then throw herself sideways again . Each time she looked over the edge it took her longer to discern his shape . Two hours after the IV went in she could n't find him at all . Louden said , " What you experienced was an illusion , Paula , a phantom generated by a short-circuiting lobe of your brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presences with a helmet and magnetic fields , for crying out loud . Your ... God was n't real . Your certainty was a symptom . " " Take me off these meds , " she said , " or so help me I 'll wrap this IV tube around your fucking neck . " " This is a disease , Paula . Some of you are seeing Jesus , but we 've got other patients seeing demons and angels , talking to ghosts - I 've got one Hindu guy who 's sharing the bed with Lord Krishna . " She twisted against the cuffs , pain spiking across her shoulders . Her jaw ached from clenching her teeth . " Paula , I need you to calm down . Your husband and daughter are downstairs . They want to visit you before you leave here . " " What ? No . No . " They could n't see her like this . It would confirm everything Richard ever thought about her . And Claire .... She was thirteen , a girl unfolding into a woman . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment . By another vivid image of her mother as a raving lunatic . " Tell them to stay away from me . The woman they knew does n't exist anymore . " This morning the detectives had emptied her bag and splayed the driver 's licenses and social security IDs like a deck of cards . How long has this been going on ? they demanded . How many people are involved ? They gave her a pencil and yellow legal pad , told her to write down all - the names she could remember . She stared at the tip of the pencil . An epidemiology book she 'd read tried to explain crystallization by talking about how carbon could become graphite or diamond depending on how the atoms were arranged . The shapes she made on the page could doom a score of her missionaries . She did n't know what to do . She turned to her companion but he was silent , already disintegrating . " You 're too late , " she told the detectives . She snapped the pencil in half and threw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months too late . " XII . They called themselves missionaries . Paula thought the name fit . They had a mission , and they would become agents of transmission . The first and last meeting included only eighteen women . Paula had first convinced Tonya and Rosa from the yellow house , and they had widened the circle to a handful of women from houses around Philly , and from there they persuaded a few more women from New York and New Jersey . Paula had met some of them at Merilee 's feast , but most were strangers . Some , like Tonya , were mothers of sons , but all of them had become convinced that it was time to take the gospel into the world . They met at a Denny 's restaurant in the western suburbs , where Steph and the other women would n't see them . " The host is not a virus , " Paula said . " It 's not bacterial . It ca n't be detected or filtered out the way other diseases are , it ca n't be killed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . " A piece of paper can become a sailboat or swan , she told them . A simple protein , folded and copied a million times , could bring you Kuru , or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , or salvation . " The body of Christ is powerful , " Paula said . They knew : all of them had taken pan in feasts and had been saved through them . " But there 's also power in the blood . " She dealt out the driver licenses , two to each woman . Rosa 's old contacts had made them for fifty bucks apiece . " One of these is all you need to donate . We 're working on getting more . With four IDs you can give blood twice a month . " She told them how to answer the Red Cross surveys , which iron supplements to buy , which foods they should bulk up on to avoid anemia . They talked about secrecy . Most of the other women they lived with were too bound by tradition to see that they were only half doing God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her a dozen times over the months , but could not convince her . Paula loved Steph , and owed so much to her , but she could n't sit idly by any longer . " We have to donate as often as possible , " Paula said . " We have to spread the host so far and so fast that they ca n't stop us by rounding us up . " The incubation time depended directly on the amount consumed , so the more that was in the blood supply the faster the conversions would occur . Paula 's conversion had taken months . For others it might be years . " But once they 're exposed to the host the conversion will happen , " Paula said . " It ca n't be stopped . One seed crystal can transform the ocean . " She could feel them with her . They could see the shape of the new world . The women would never again meet all together like this - too dangerous - but they did n't need to . They 'd already become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they left the restaurant . " Go , " she told them . " Multiply . " XIII . The visitor seemed familiar . Paula tilted her head to see through the bars as the woman walked toward the cell . It had become too much of a bother to lift Paula out of the bed and wheel her down to the conference room , so now the visitors came to her . Doctors and lawyers , always and only doctors and lawyers . This woman , though , did n't look like either . " Hello , Paula , " she said . " It 's Esther Wynne . Do you remember me ? " " Ah . " The memory came back to her , those first days in the hospital . The Christian woman . Of course she 'd be Paula 's first voluntary visitor . " Hello , Esther . " She struggled to enunciate clearly . In the year since they 'd seen each other , Paula 's condition had worsened . Lips and jaw and arms refused to obey her , shaking and jerking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest like Merilee 's . Her spine bent her nearly in half , so that she had to lie on her side . " You look - " She made a sound like a laugh , a hiccupping gasp forced from her chest by an unruly diaphragm . " - good . " The guard positioned a chair in front of the bars and the older woman sat down . Her hair was curled and sprayed . Under the makeup her skin looked healthy . " I 've been worried about you , " Esther said . " Are they treating you well ? " Paula almost smiled . " As well as you can treat a mass murderer . " Some facts never escaped her . The missionaries had spread the disease to thousands , perhaps tens of thousands . But more damaging , they 'd completely corrupted the blood supply . New prion filters were now on the market , but millions of gallons of blood had to be destroyed . They told her she might be ultimately responsible for the deaths of a million people . Paula gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracked down all of the original eighteen , but by then the mission could go on without them . A day after the meeting in the restaurant they 'd begun to recruit others , women and men Paula would never meet , whose names would never be spoken to her . The church would continue . In secret now , hunted by the FBI and the CDC and the world 's governments , but growing every day . The host was passed needle by needle in private ceremonies , but increasingly on a mass scale as well . In an Ohio dairy processing plant , a man had been caught mixing his blood into the vats of milk . In Florida , police arrested a woman for injecting blood into the skulls of chickens . The economic damage was already in the trillions . The emotional toll on the public , in panic and paranoia , was incalculable . Esther looked around at the cell . " You do n't have anything in there with you . Can I bring you books ? Magazines ? They told me they 'd allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want anything , " Paula said . She could n't hold her head steady enough to read . She watched TV to remind herself every day of what she 'd done to the world . Outside the prison , a hundred jubilant protestors had built a tent city . They sang hymns and chanted for her release , and every day a hundred counter-protestors showed up to scream threats , throw rocks , and chant for her death . Police in riot gear made daily arrests . Esther frowned . " I thought maybe you 'd like a Bible . " Now Paula laughed for real . " What are you doing here , Esther ? I see that look in your eye , you think I do n't recognize it ? " Paula twisted , pressed herself higher on one elbow . Esther had never been infected by the host - they would n't have let her in here if she did n't pass the screening - but her strain of the disease was just as virulent . " Did your Jesus tell you to come here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman did n't seem flustered . Paula found that annoying . Esther said , " You do n't have to go through this alone . Even here , even after all you 've done , God will forgive you . He can be here for you , if you want him . " Paula stared at her . If I want him . She never stopped craving him . He 'd carved out a place for himself , dug a warren through the cells in her brain , until he 'd erased even himself . She no longer needed pharmaceuticals to suppress him . He 'd left behind a jagged Christ-shaped hole , a darkness with teeth . She wanted him more than drugs , more than alcohol , more than Richard or Claire . She thought she 'd known loneliness , but the past months had taught her new depths . Nothing would feel better than to surrender to a new god , let herself be wrapped again in loving arms . Esther stood and leaned close to the bars so that their faces were only a couple feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you 'd go to heaven ? " The guard told her to step back but she ignored him . She pushed one arm through the bars . " If you want to accept him , take my hand . Reach out . " " Oh , Esther , the last - " Her upper lip pulled back over her gums . " - last thing I want is to live forever . " She fell back against the bed , tucked her working arm to her chest . A million people . There were acts beyond forgiveness . There were debts that had to be paid in person . " Not hiding anymore , " Paula said . She shook her head . " No gods , no drugs . The only thing I need to do now - " She laughed , but it was an involuntary spasm , joyless . She waited a moment until it passed , and breathed deep . " I need to die clean .
