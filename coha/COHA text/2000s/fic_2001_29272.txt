Prologue The White Mercedes Going to work was the same everywhere , and the changeover from Marxism-Leninism to Chaos-Capitalism had n't changed matters much-well , maybe things were now a little worse . Moscow , a city of wide streets , was harder to drive in now that nearly anyone could have a car , and the center lane down the wide boulevards was no longer tended by militiamen for the Politburo and used by Central Committee men who considered it a personal right of way , like Czarist princes in their troika sleds . Now it was a left-turn lane for anyone with a Zil or other private car . In the case of Sergey Nikolay'ch Golovko , the car was a white Mercedes 600 , the big one with the S-class body and twelve cylinders of German power under the hood . There were n't many of them in Moscow , and truly his was an extravagance that ought to have embarrassed him . . . but did n't . Maybe there were no more nomenklatura in this city , but rank did have its privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment was also large , on the top floor of a high-rise building on Kutusovskiy Prospekt , a structure relatively new and well-made , down to the German appliances which were a long-standing luxury accorded senior government officials . He did n't drive himself . He had Anatoliy for that , a burly former Spetsnaz special-operations soldier who carried a pistol under his coat and who drove the car with ferocious aggression , while tending it with loving care . The windows were coated with dark plastic , which denied the casual onlooker the sight of the people inside , and the windows were thick , made of polycarbonate and specced to stopanything up to a 12.7-mm bullet , or so the company had told Golovko 's purchasing agents sixteen months before . The armor made it nearly a ton heavier than was the norm for an S600 Benz , but the power and the ride did n't seem to suffer from that . It was the uneven streets that would ultimately destroy the car . Road-paving was a skill that his country had not yet mastered , Golovko thought as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the American International Herald Tribune , always a good source of news since it was a joint venture of The Washington Post and The New York Times , which were together two of the most skilled intelligence services in the world , if a little too arrogant to be the true professionals Sergey Nikolay'ch and his people were . He 'd joined the intelligence business when the agency had been known as the KGB , the Committee for State Security , still , he thought , the best such government department the world had ever known , even if it had ultimately failed . Golovko sighed . Had the USSR not fallen in the early 1990s , then his place as Chairman would have put him as a full voting member of the Politburo , a man of genuine power in one of the world 's two superpowers , a man whose mere gaze could make strong men tremble . . . but . . . no , what was the use of that ? he asked himself . It was all an illusion , an odd thing for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That had always been the cruel dichotomy . KGB had always been on the lookout for hard facts , but then reported those facts to people besotted with a dream , who then bent the truth in the service of that dream . When the truth had finally broken through , the dream had suddenly evaporated like a cloud of steam in a high wind , and reality had poured in like the flood following the breakup of an icebound river in springtime . And then the Politburo , those brilliant men who 'd wagered their lives on the dream , had found that their theories had been only the thinnest of reeds , and reality was the swinging scythe , and the eminence bearing that tool did n't deal in salvation . But it was not so for Golovko . A dealer in facts , he 'd been able to continue his profession , for his government still needed them . In fact , his authority was broader now than it would have been , because as a man who well knew the surrounding world and some of its more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his president , and so he had a voice in foreign policy , defense , and domestic matters . Of them , the third was the trickiest lately , which had rarely been the case before . It was now also the most dangerous . It was an odd thing . Previously , the mere spoken ( more often , shouted ) phrase " State Security ! " would freeze Soviet citizens in their stride , for KGB had been the most feared organ of the previous government , with power such as Reinhart Heydrich 's Sicherheitsdienst had only dreamed about , the power to arrest , imprison , interrogate , and to kill any citizen it wished , with no recourse at all . But that , too , was a thing of the past . Now KGB was split , and the domestic-security branch was a shadow of its former self , while the SVR-formerly the First Chief Directorate-still gathered information , but lacked the immediate strength that had come with being able to enforce the will , if not quite the law , of the communist government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , folding the paper . He was only a kilometer away from Dzerzhinskiy Square . That , too , was no longer the same . The statue of Iron Feliks was gone . It had always been a chilling sight to those who 'd known who the man was whose bronze image had stood alone in the square , but now it , too , was a distant memory . The building behind it was the same , however . Once the stately home office of the Rossiya Insurance Company , it had later been known as the Lubyanka , a fearsome word even in the fearsome land ruled by Iosef Vissarionovich Stalin , with its basement full of cells and interrogation rooms . Most of those functions had been transferred over the years to Lefortovo Prison to the east , as the KGB bureaucracy had grown , as all such bureaucracies grow , filling the vast building like an expanding balloon , as it claimed every room and corner until secretaries and file clerks occupied the ( remodeled ) spaces where Kamenev and Ordzhonikidze had been tortured under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been too many ghosts . Well , a new working day beckoned . A staff meeting at 8:45 , then the normal routine of briefings and discussions , lunch at 12:15 , and with luck he 'd be back in the car and on his way back home soon after six , before he had to change for the reception at the French Embassy . He looked forward to the food and wine , if not the conversation . Another car caught his eye . It was a twin to his own , another large Mercedes S-class , iceberg white just like his own , complete down to the American-made dark plastic on the windows . It was driving purposefully in the bright morning , as Anatoliy slowed and pulled behind a dump truck , one of the thousand such large ugly vehicles that covered the streets of Moscow like a dominant life-form , this one 's load area cluttered with hand tools rather than filled with earth . There was yet another truck a hundred meters beyond , driving slowly as though its driver was unsure of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see around the truck in front of his Benz , wishing for the first cup of Sri Lankan tea at his desk , in the same room that Beriya had once . . . the distant dump truck . A man had been lying in the back . Now he rose , and he was holding . . . " Anatoliy ! " Golovko said sharply , but his driver could n't see around the truck to his immediate front . . . . it was an RPG , a slender pipe with a bulbous end . The sighting bar was up , and as the distant truck was now stopped , the man came up to one knee and turned , aiming his weapon at the other white Benzthe other driver saw it and tried to swerve , but found his way blocked by the morning traffic andnot much in the way of a visual signature , just a thin puff of smoke from the rear of the launcher-tube , but the bulbous part leapt off and streaked into the hood of the other white Mercedes , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The explosion was n't the fireball so beloved of Western movies , just a muted flash and gray smoke , but the sound roared across the square , and a wide , flat , jagged hole blew out of the trunk of the car , and that meant that anyone inside the vehicle would now be dead , Golovko knew without pausing to think on it . Then the gasoline ignited , and the car burned , along with a few square meters of asphalt . The Mercedes stopped almost at once , its left-side tires shredded and flattened by the explosion . The dump truck in front of Golovko 's car panic-stopped , and Anatoliy swerved right , his eyes narrowed by the noise , but not yet- " Govno ! " Now Anatoliy saw what had happened and took action . He kept moving right , accelerating hard and swerving back and forth as his eyes picked holes in the traffic . The majority of the vehicles in sight had stopped , and Golovko 's driver sought out the holes and darted through them , arriving at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The armed guards there were already moving out into the square , along with the supplementary response force from its shack just inside and out of sight . The commander of the group , a senior lieutenant , saw Golovko 's car and recognized it , waved him inside and motioned to two of his men to accompany it to the drop-off point . The arrival time was now the only normal aspect of the young day . Golovko stepped out , and two young soldiers formed up in physical contact with his heavy topcoat . Anatoliy stepped out , too , his pistol in his hand and his coat open , looking back through the gate with suddenly anxious eyes . His head turned quickly . " Get him inside ! " And with that order , the two privates strong-armed Golovko through the double bronze doors , where more security troops were arriving . " This way , Comrade Chairman , " a uniformed captain said , taking Sergey Nikolay'ch 's arm and heading off to the executive elevator . A minute later , he stumbled into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had seen just three minutes before . Of course , he walked to the window to look down . Moscow police-called militiamen-were racing to the scene , three of them on foot . Then a police car appeared , cutting through the stopped traffic . Three motorists had left their vehicles and approached the burning car , perhaps hoping to render assistance . Brave of them , Golovko thought , but an entirely useless effort . He could see better now , even at a distance of three hundred meters . The top had bulged up . The windshield was gone , and he looked into a smoking hole , which had minutes before been a hugely expensive vehicle , and which had been destroyed by one of the cheapest weapons the Red Army had ever mass-produced . Whoever had been inside had been shredded instantly by metal fragments traveling at nearly ten thousand meters per second . Had they even known what had happened ? Probably not . Perhaps the driver had had time to look and wonder , but the owner of the car in the back had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ended without warning . That was when Golovko 's knees went weak . That could have been him . . . suddenly learning if there were an afterlife after all , one of the great mysteries of life , but not one which had occupied his thoughts very often . . . But whoever had done the killing , who had been his target ? As Chairman of the SVR , Golovko was not a man to believe in coincidences , and there were not all that many white Benz S600s in Moscow , were there ? " Comrade Chairman ? " It was Anatoliy at the office door . " Yes , Anatoliy Ivan'ch ? " " Are you well ? " " Better than he , " Golovko replied , stepping away from the window . He needed to sit now . He tried to move to his swivel chair without staggering , for his legs were suddenly weak indeed . He sat and found the surface of his desk with both his hands , and looked down at the oaken surface with its piles of papers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now routine at all . He looked up . Anatoliy Ivan'ch Shelepin was not a man to show fear . He 'd served in Spetsnaz through his captaincy , before being spotted by a KGB talent scout for a place in the 8th " Guards " Directorate , which he 'd accepted just in time for KGB to be broken apart . But Anatoliy had been Golovko 's driver and bodyguard for years now , part of his official family , like an elder son , and Shelepin was devoted to his boss . He was a tall , bright man of thirty-three years , with blond hair and blue eyes that were now far larger than usual , because though Anatoliy had trained for much of his life to deal with and in violence , this was the first time he 'd actually been there to see it when it happened . Anatoliy had often wondered what it might be like to take a life , but never once in his career had he contemplated losing his own , certainly not to an ambush , and most certainly not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At his desk outside Golovko 's office , he acted like a personal secretary more than anything else . Like all such men , he 'd grown casual in the routine of protecting someone whom no one would dare attack , but now his comfortable world had been sundered as completely and surely as that of his boss . Oddly , but predictably , it was Golovko 's brain that made it back to reality first . " Anatoliy ? " " Yes , Chairman ? " " We need to find out who died out there , and then find out if it was supposed to be us instead . Call militia headquarters , and see what they are doing . " " At once . " The handsome young face disappeared from the doorway . Golovko took a deep breath and rose , taking another look out the window as he did so . There was a fire engine there now , and firefighters were spraying the wrecked car to extinguish the lingering flames . An ambulance was standing by as well , but that was a waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first order of business was to get the license-plate number from the car and identify its owner , and from that knowledge determine if the unfortunate had died in Golovko 's place , or perhaps had possessed enemies of his own . Rage had not yet supplanted the shock of the event . Perhaps that would come later , Golovko thought , as he took a step toward his private washroom , for suddenly his bladder was weak . It seemed a horrid display of frailty , but Golovko had never known immediate fear in his life , and , like many , thought in terms of the movies . The actors there were bold and resolute , never mind that their words were scripted and their reactions rehearsed , and none of it was anything like what happened when explosives arrived in the air without warning . Who wants me dead ? he wondered , after flushing the toilet .
