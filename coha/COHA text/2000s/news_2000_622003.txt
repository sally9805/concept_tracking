<p> It is an eternally frustrating way to pass 15 minutes or half an hour : circling the block , looking for a parking place . <p> Or you could sit in line to get into a multistory garage and , once inside , wind your way up and up and up , ramp by ramp , before driving slowly past ranks of parked cars , searching for a space , any space . <p> Here in Hoboken , a densely populated bedroom community of 37,000 just across the Hudson River from New York , they got tired of all that . Now they are putting the finishing touches on what experts say will be the first fully automated parking garage in North America . <p> With its space-saving design , which has lower ceiling heights and eliminates the need for ramps , the garage doubles the number of parking places that could normally be built on a given piece of land . <p> This may well be the real " valet parking " of the future , not only in Hoboken but in every big city that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco business leaders , fed up with parking and congestion problems , asked Mayor Willie Brown to create 10,000 new parking spots in the South of Market area . <p> " There are a lot of people around the country who are watching this project in Hoboken , " said Richard Beebe , a Chicago transportation engineer who is considered one of the world 's experts on automatic parking garages . He is a consultant to the Hoboken Parking Authority , which owns the new garage . <p> Beebe said he has had inquiries from hospitals , colleges and universities , and parking authorities nationwide  --  " wherever people are seriously short of real estate and need parking garages . " <p> In its simplest explanation , automatic parking moves cars on steel pallets up , down and horizontally , then parks them in isolated cubes . Powered by electric motors , the action is carried out through a series of computer-controlled vertical lifts and horizontal carrier racks . Inside , with its towering steel girders , the garage structure looks like a cross between an Erector set and a Rubik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some developers in San Francisco , Berkeley and elsewhere are already installing a smaller cousin of automatic parking . Known as " stacked parking , " it saves parking space in residential and commercial buildings using a system something like a vertical conveyer belt . Cars are stored manually on steel platforms stacked one above the other , which sink below ground level when vehicles on upper platforms are parked or retrieved . <p> DEMONSTRATION GARAGE IN OHIO <p> The garage in Hoboken , scheduled to open in July , is being built by New Jersey contractor Belcor Construction Inc . The concept , however , is the work of Robotic Parking , a Leetonia , Ohio , firm that designed a fully automatic parking garage similar to systems that have been in widespread use in Europe and Asia for 40 years . Robotic built a three-story , 20-stall demonstration version of its garage at its headquarters . The performance of the garage sold Belcor on the system . <p> " There are several automated systems out there , " said Belcor President Frank Belgiovine , referring to others he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but nothing that comes close to this . " <p> The seven-floor Hoboken garage , which is in the middle of a residential block , sits on a 100-by-100-foot lot and has 324 spaces . The city would have been able to park only 26 cars on the bare lot . <p> The garage spaces will be leased monthly to neighborhood residents . At the Hoboken Parking Authority , they already have a waiting list of more than 600 people who have been circling the block for years . <p> HOW THE SYSTEM OPERATES <p> Here 's how Robotic Parking 's system works : A car approaches one of the garage 's entrances . An overhead door goes up , and the car drives onto a steel pallet . The driver gets out of the car , goes to the front of the garage and gets a coded ticket and a PIN code , like the ones people use at ATMs . Then the overhead door closes , and the driver walks away . <p> Inside the garage , a computer-controlled system goes to work . A steel frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift the pallet up about one inch , and the pallet moves into a vast central atrium . The pallet is put on a carrier and then moved horizontally or up a few floors and horizontally again , depending on where the computer can find an empty slot . <p> To get the car out , the driver puts in the coded card , punches in the PIN , pays the fare shown , and the car comes back the same way it left . <p> Nobody touches the car , so there are no chances of dings , dents or outright demolition from careless attendants . And because the car is in its own isolated spot , there is no chance it will be stolen or broken into , and no chance you will be mugged on your way to a remote parking stall . In fact , the keys can be left in the ignition . <p> BACKUP IN CASE OF A PROBLEM <p> Robotic Parking 's president , Gerhard Haag , is an engineer who once worked for Krupp , the big German steel firm , which developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car in his system takes no more than about two minutes , even when several drivers are waiting . In case there is a glitch , there are a backup generator and two computers running in tandem . The garage also has an around-the-clock attendant who can run the system manually if necessary . <p> " The technology comes from the automated transfer system in the car industry , moving half-finished cars back and forth from assembly point to assembly point , " Haag said the other day during a tour of the facility . " It also comes from automated warehouse technology , moving material and products around . " <p> Parking Authority Chairman Donald Pellicano and several other Hoboken officials signed on to the automatic garage concept four years ago , when they took a whirlwind 10-day tour of Europe , inspecting garages in different cities . <p> " We were in Duderstadt , Germany , " Pellicano said , " with its teeny houses and narrow cobblestone streets . I felt I was in Hoboken , Germany . Took our car to the garage , push a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . That 's the end of your vehicle . " <p> " Then we come back , pay , next thing you know there 's my car , " he said . " That 's what sold me on it . " <p> ROBOTIC PARKING URGED FOR S.F. <p> It 's this kind of word-of-mouth that has San Francisco Supervisor Michael Yaki saying that " we are the perfect example of a place that would be appropriate for this . We 're highly built up , we have many streets that are very narrow , and land is a scarce commodity . " <p> San Francisco 's propensity for the occasional earthquake would not pose insurmountable problems , according to Haag . <p> " You design for the expected force , " he said . " And you have to remember the floors are strong because all the pallets on a given floor become one big steel floor . " <p> Yaki said he has asked the city attorney to change the planning code specifically to allow for stacked and automatic parking devices . <p> While automatic parking has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already flourishing . <p> STACKED PARKING IN BERKELEY <p> Berkeley developer Patrick Kennedy has installed more than 100 stacked parking spaces in his mixed-use projects in Berkeley . He said that in one building , at 1910 Oxford St. , he used stacked parking machinery to install 39 spaces where he could normally have built only 12 . <p> During a recent demonstration at the Oxford Street garage , Sudhir Pala , a 19-year-old student at the University of California at Berkeley , put his key in an electronic lock , and the elevator moved slowly down . <p> " It fits in three times as many cars , " he said , " but if you 're in a hurry , it 's a little inconvenient . " <p> It took about 65 seconds to move the car down to ground level . <p> As for robotic parking , there is one aspect that should not be foreign to Bay Area high-tech jillionaires , with their affinity for luxury cars : <p> " Take a place like Hoboken , where they have all these yuppies working on Wall Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hate to leave a $45,000 Jaguar out on the street from day to day . So they bring in one of these garages , and people get very excited about the idea : Now I 've got a place to put my Beemer !
