Ride the Fire By Pamela Clare Dorchester Publishing Pamela Clare Nicholas awoke with a jerk , caught between the nightmare and wakefulness , his heart pounding , his body covered with sweat . He struggled to open his eyes , found himself lying on his stomach in someone 's bed , his head on a pillow . His right leg throbbed , burned . His head ached . His throat was parched as sand , and a strange aftertaste lingered in his mouth . From nearby came the swish of skirts , the sound of a log settling in a fire , the scent of something cooking . Where was he ? Through a fog he tried to remember . He 'd been attacked . The Frenchmen from the fort . He 'd lost a lot of blood , had ridden in search of help . The cabin . The woman . Bethie was her name . Elspeth Stewart . She 'd helped him , cleaned his wound , cauterized it - not altogether willingly . Nicholas lifted his head , started to roll onto his side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wrists and ankles were bound to the bedposts . Blood rushed to his head , a dark surge of rage , of dread . " You 're awake . " Her voice came from behind him . " You must be thirsty . " " You little bitch ! " He pulled on the ropes , his fury and dread rising when they held fast . " Release me ! Now ! " " I-I can nae do that - no ' yet . I 've made broth . It will help you regain- " " Damn your broth , woman ! Untie me ! " He jerked on theropes again , outraged and alarmed to find himself rendered powerless . Sharp pain cut through his right thigh . " Stop your strugglin ' ! You 'll split your wound open and make it bleed again . " Infuriated , Nicholas growled , a sound more animal than human , even to his own ears . He jerked violently on the ropes , but it was futile . He was still weak from blood loss , and the effort left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Damn her ! He closed his eyes , fought to subdue the slick current of panic that slid up from his belly , caught in his throat . She was not Lyda . This was not the Wyandot village . His heartbeat slowed . The panic subsided , left white-hot rage in its wake . " Why did you do this ? I told you I meant you no harm ! " He craned his neck , saw that she stood before the fire , ladling liquid into a tin cup , a brown knitted shawl around her shoulders . " Is that no ' what the wolf always says to the lamb ? " She carried the cup to the bed , sat . " Drink . It will help to replenish your blood . Careful . ' T is hot . " Tantalized by the smell of the broth and suddenly aching with thirst , Nicholas bit back the curse that sat on his tongue , drank . Bethie held the cup to his lips , watched as he swallowed the broth , her heart still racing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would break or come loose . She 'd known he would be angry with her , but she had n't expected him to try to rip the bed apart . Truth be told , she feared him despite the ropes . Although he 'd given up for the moment , she could feel the fury coiled inside him . She could see it in the rippling tension of his body , in his clenched fists , in the unforgiving glare in his eyes . He made her think of a caged cougar - spitting angry and untamed . He was not used to being bested . The arrogant brute ! Did he imagine she would grant him warm hospitality after the way he 'd treated her ? It served him right to be bound and helpless ! As if a man of his strength were ever truly helpless . Her gaze traveled the length of him as it had done many times while he 'd slept , and she found her eyes focused of their own will on the rounded muscles of his buttocks where the butter-soft leather clung so tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat rise in her cheeks . Her stepfather had always said she was possessed of a sinful nature . " More . " His boorish command interrupted her thoughts . He glowered at her through eyes of slate . " Aye . " She stood , hurried to the fireplace , ladled more broth into the cup , uncomfortably aware that he was watching her . " How long do you intend to keep me a prisoner ? " His voice was rough , full of repressed rage . She walked back to the bed , sat , feigned a calm she did not feel . " ' T is your own fault you lie bound . You can nae be expectin ' to be treated as a guest when you behaved like a felon . Drink . " He pulled his head away , his gaze hard upon her , held up the ropes that bound his wrists . " This is n't necessary . " " You threatened me , held your pistol to my head , forced me to do your will and admitted to killin ' two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He frowned , his dark brows pensive . " I did n't mean to frighten you . " " As I recollect , you seemed quite bent on frightenin ' me . " " I did n't have time for social graces . My need was dire . " " So is mine ! " She stood in a surge of temper , met his gaze . " I can nae risk you regainin ' your strength and then , when you no longer need my help , hurtin ' me or my baby or takin ' what is ours and leavin ' us in the cold to starve ! I dinnae even know your name ! " For a moment he said nothing . " Kenleigh . Nicholas Kenleigh . " She repeated his name aloud . " Now that we 've exchanged pleasantries , Mistress Stewart , you will release me . " " Nay , Master Kenleigh . I willna - no ' just yet . " She lifted her chin . " You 'll stay as you are till I 'm certain you pose no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snort . " And how will you determine that ? " " Drink . " She held the cup once more to his lips . " Perhaps I shall have you swear an oath , a bindin ' oath . " He drained the cup , looked up at her . " And if I am a murdering liar , a man with no honor , the sort of man who would harm a woman ripe with child , how would this oath prevent me from doing whatever I want the moment you cut me free ? " Bethie stood , walked back to the fireplace to refill the cup once more , the truth in his words dashing her sense of safety to pieces . " Are you sayin ' I should never set you free , Master Kenleigh ? " " No , Mistress Stewart . I 'm saying that unless you plan to keep me a prisoner forever and care for me as if I were a babe untrained in the use of a chamber pot , sooner or later you have no choice but to trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt her step falter . In truth , she had n't thought about how or when she would release him when she 'd bound him to the bed . Nor had she considered what keeping him bound would mean . She 'd been thinking only of a way to restrain him and deprive him of his weapons , and she had accomplished that . A babe untrained in the use of a chamber pot ? Good heavens She reached the bed , sat , held the cup once more to his lips . " Very well . I shall cut you free . But you shall first swear to me by all you hold sacred that you willna do anythin ' to harm me or my baby or to deprive us of our hearth and home . " He swallowed , licked broth from his lips . Then a queer look came over his face . He stared at the tin cup , then gaped at her . " You drugged me ! " How did he know ? " I-I gave you medicine to ease your pain - and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You drugged me so that you could bind me and take my weapons . " He stated it so plainly that Bethie could find no words to soften the truth of what she 'd done . She rested a hand protectively on her belly , felt her baby shift within her . " Y-you left me no choice . " Nicholas saw the defiant tilt of her chin , noticed the pink that crept into her cheeks . He noticed , too , the way her hand softly caressed the swollen curve of her abdomen as if to calm the small life inside her . What would he have done in her place ? He dismissed the question - and the irritating impulse to defend his previous actions toward her . There was only one rule in the wild - survival . He 'd only done what he 'd felt he had to do to stay alive . And so had she . ( Continues ... ) by Pamela Clare                    @
