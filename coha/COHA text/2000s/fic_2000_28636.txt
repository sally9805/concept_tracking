Years later , when she surfaced again , Adie Klarpol could n't say just how she 'd pictured the place . Could n't even begin to draw what she 'd imagined . Some subterranean confection of dripped stone , swarming with blind cave newts . A spelunker 's scale model Carlsbad . Summer dacha of the Mountain King . The Cavern , Stevie had called it . Stevie Spiegel , phoning her up out of nowhere , in the middle of the night , after years of their thinking one another dead , when they thought of each other at all . The Cavern . A name that formed every shape in her mind except its own . She had not placed him on the phone . It 's Steve , he said . And still , she was anywhere . Adie fumbled with the handset in the dark . She struggled backward , upstream , toward a year when an a capella Steve might have meant something . Steve .

Do n't tell me : you 've torched your entire past . A vision of herself at twenty-one congealed in front of her , like the Virgin come to taunt Slavic schoolchildren . Recollection swamped her carefully packed sandbags . Steve Spiegel . The three of them had planned to live the rest of their lives together , once . He , she , and the man who 'd live long enough to become Adie 's ex-husband . Jesus ! Stevie . Her voice skidded away from her , a gypsum imitation ofpleasure 's bronze . Stevie . What on earth have you been doing with yourself ? Doing ... ? Adie , my love . You still make life sound like a summer camp craft project . It is n't ? No , you decorative little dauber . It is not .

I thought we might be able to hook up . Outside her loft , the stink of singed oil and rotting vegetables settled . Car alarms clear down to the Battery sounded the predawn call to prayer . She cradled the phone under her chin , a fiddler between reels . Steve , it 's kind of late ... She hoisted the guillotine window above her futon , its counterweights long ago lost at the bottom of the sash 's well . She crawled out onto her fire hazard of a fire escape , adopting her favorite phone crouch , rocking on her haunches , her lumbar pressed to the rose brick . Jesus Christ , he said . I am so sorry . Entirely forgot the time difference . What is it out there : like after one ? I mean , it 's a little late for reunions , is n't it ? Missing the whole point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual too-lateness , the basic one-step-behindhood of existence . Oh , I do n't want a reunion , Ade . I just want you . She laughed him off and they pressed on . They made the obligatory exchange of hostages , each giving over the short versions of their overland passage across the intervening decade . Seattle , he told her . Can you believe it ? Your doltish poet friend , the one who used to spout " Sunday Morning " until late Monday night . Supporting the computer industry 's insidious plan for world domination . Still lower Manhattan , she replied . Your washed-up watercolorist . Currently supporting the wall of my crumbling apartment building with the small of my back . Surprised ? he asked . About ... ? About where we 've landed ? Nobody lands , she said . So how is the world of software ? It 's the oddest thing , Ade . Ade : as if they still knew each other . You know , I lied to get into this business in the first place .

Sometimes you got ta wonder . Wonder , in fact , was why he 'd called . He 'd come to rest in a moist den of pine on a twisty black macadam road looking out over Puget Sound . He was coding for a start-up called the Realization Lab , the latest tendril of that runaway high-tech success story TeraSys . But the RL was still experimental , more of a tax write-off than a source of any near-term revenue . TeraSys ? You mean you work for that little Boy Billionaire ? Indirectly , he laughed . And they 're all boy billionaires out here . What does your building look like ? What do you mean ? My building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything ? I 'm trying to visualize where you are .

Out here , we 're usually just getting started around 10 p.m . Just tell me where you are . OK , look : I 'll start . I 'm squatting in my undershirt out on a black wrought-iron grille about twenty feet above the exhaust fan of the kitchen of a pasta dive ... He played along , the stakes high . Khaki shorts and a green raglan T-shirt . Kicked back in a molded plastic office chair in the middle of a ... well ... redwood-and-cedar kind of thing . Lots of river stone . Local materials . Very tasteful , they declared in unison . Old shtick , recovered from a dozen lost lives ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building look like ? I 've never really thought about it , Adie . Come on , poet . Look around you . Walk me through the front door . Hmm . Let 's see . Maybe 10,000 square feet of usable floor , all on a single story . Lots of brick and earth tones . A maze of little cubicles made out of those tan-fabric-lined divider things . There 's a nice little sunken atrium and such . A ton of vegetation per cubic liter . Big panoramic expanse of passive-solar smart window looking out at Rainier , on the ventral side . I see . Kind of a futuristic forest ranger 's roost . Sure . Why not ? You 'll love it . Hang on . You ? As in me ... ? He slowed and unfolded . We 're putting together a prototype immersion environment we 're calling the Cavern . Computer-Assisted Virtual Environ Look , Adie .

Have n't lost your knack for words , I see . Nothing had changed in him . He was still that kid of twenty , compelled to round up and protect everything he thought he loved . A mini-Moses , still shepherding around the dream of starting an artist 's colony where he could gather all those who needed a hideout from the real world . His voice alone was proof , if Adie ever needed it : no one abandons his first survival kit . The most we ever do is upgrade the splints . You 're exactly what the project is looking for , Adie . We can make these incredible digital circus animals , and we can get them to jump through any hoop imaginable . We just need someone who can draw the hoops . I do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're all coders and chrome monkeys . A bunch of logic monsters , trying to make walk-in , graphical worlds . We need someone who can see . Know how I picture it out there ? Open-toe sandals made out of silicon . Fuzzy-faced , bicycling Boeing executives . Tofu-eating knowledge engineers and multiply-pierced , purple-frosted meth heads waiting next to each other on the curb for the Walk light . See ? You know what the place looks like before you 've even seen it . I told the team how you used to do those Draw-the-Pirate tests as a kid and fix all the original 's errors . I showed them that ARTFORUM sidebar . The reviews of your SoHo show in ' 79 ... Oh God , Stevie . That 's ancient history . Oh , I went further back than that . I showed them my color slide of your huge acrylic group portrait of us . The one that won the university painting prize ... ? How dare you . I hate you . I told them about the award controversy . How one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he refused to believe that you 'd actually freehanded ... Steven . We were children then . You do n't have to fly a stranger across the continent just to find someone who can draw . Courtroom portraitists are a dollar ninety-eight a square yard . Besides , I already have a life . You 're not a stranger , Ade . He sounded hurt . That 's what 's so perfect about this . You do n't have to stop painting . Just come out here and do what you Steve . You have the wrong person . I do n't do ... I 'm not painting anymore . Silence pinged off the far coast , full duplex . Did something happen ? he asked . Tons happened . Oh , all my parts are still intact , if that 's what you mean . It 's just that painting 's over . No great loss , I assure you . Loss ? Adie ! How can you say that ?

I have no problem with designing for a living . Copy and paste . All the pastel coffee mugs and cartoon cars that you want . But Art 's done . Adie . If you can still make ... Do you see ? This would be a chance to do something completely ... Sounds like you 're looking for somebody else , Stevie . For the greatest illustrator since representation self-destructed . Well , have it your way . Something in his voice said : You always did . But do me a favor , Adie ? Just make sure that you see this thing once before you die . The sentence jumped out at her , from a place she could not make out . The sound of the words , their roll , their order . See this thing once , before you die . The strange familiarity of the invitation caught her ear , if not yet her eyes . Put it that way , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said . He 'd never asked for anything but the chance to save her . Whenever you like . Preferably after 10 p.m . The hard rose building brick pressed up against the small of her back . From a flight and a half up above night 's fire escape where she sat , she watched herself say , How about a week from next Tuesday , then ? On you . Chapter Two He gave her an address : a foothill road , twisting above the suburbs of that boomtown port built to service a forgotten gold rush . In her mind 's eye , Adie pictured the Cavern , lying beached like art 's ark , perched on a leeward Cascade slope greened by rains that forever returned yesterday 's soaked breeze to the Pacific . Spiegel expressed her the promotional brochures . In them , glossy images traced the Cavern back to the underground grottos of paint 's nativity . In faded watermark beneath the tables of hardware specs , she could make out the faint traces of those Paleolithic herds , stained into stone thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digits , stenciled to the rockoutlines of the same phantom fingers that applied the rougewaved at her from out of the world 's original apse . And across the folds of the glossy brochure , from three hundred centuries on , 3-D , multiplanar , true-color , walk-around holograms waved back . Adie arrived that first evening , after six hours trapped in the sealed hold of a 737 . Stevie was there at the airport to Virgil her back to the Realization Lab . A dozen years . More . They hugged briefly at the arrival gate , laughed , started to falter over the baggage carousel , and drove straight out to his lair in the silence of small talk . The RL baffled her . It resembled Stevie 's description even less than he resembled the Wisconsin boy she 'd gone to college with . It smelled faintly of ammonia and fake chemical lemon , the spoor of the late-night cleaning crew . She lingered in the central atrium , rubbing her hands along the redwood walls , trying to bring her image of the place into line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office he 'd been sitting in when he 'd called her . Steve gave her an impatient tour of the facility , under the compact fluorescent lights . Then he hurried her down the maze of runways , back into a room that opened onto a stalagmite-strewn pitch-blackness . She knew black . Her friends in the downtown demimonde never deserted it , save for the sporadic bout of unavoidable nakedness . She did well around black . She understood it : one of the big two , not a true color , yet fraternizing with the deepest maroons , hoping to smuggle itself back over hue 's closely guarded border . But this ebony spooked her : the black of elaborate plans . Gloom unfolded to her adjusting eyes . Stray , chaotic caches of chrome appeared on all sides of her , evil little Duchamp originals . Banks of lights blinked out of the pitch , like the beady red eyes of robotic rats . Connectors and controllers littered the floor , the metallic droppings of those circuit creatures . She bobbed in a sea of digital serpents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured at her . She wanted to hack at the silicon swarmsMichael driving off the fallen angels . Who had let these devices into the world ? Who could possibly hope to track their various agendas ? Adie , whose eidetic eye once re-created the putti , garlands , and cornucopias of a garish Baroque communion rail from memory , could not have sketched these consoles , even as they hissed at her . If this was the fabled Cavern , then no . Absolutely not . She could n't work here . Not in this room . No matter what these people hoped to make . No matter what they needed from her . This is it ? she said . This is it ? Stevie chuckled . Almost there . He pointed toward a luminous opening , a glowing white shoebox , shining like a lit stage set in the general dark . That ? The Cavern ? No room ever less resembled its name . A hardware guy , Spider Lim , ran the tour for them that first night . The room 's been crashing a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's just a prototype . Yeah . Steve smirked at her in the glow of the projectors . You 'll have to use your imagination . You know how to do that , do n't you , Ade ? The two men led her through the mess of electronic umbilical cords . Spiegel touched her arm in the darkness . Adie flinched , despite herself , despite years of unlearning . But he only meant to steer her through the nested clutter on to the Cavern 's mouth . They stepped together through the missing rear wall , into the glowing room . Just like that : the audience , walking through an invisible proscenium , onto a floor-level stage . Adie found herself standing in an empty space , six by eight by ten feet , made from five large rectangles of white sandpaper . Even the floor and ceiling were movie screens . This ? You 're joking . This is nothing but a glorified walk-in closet . Put these on , Spider Lim answered . Plastic glasses : lightweight , tinted , wraparound . A high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they have wires coming out of them . She tweezed them at arm 's length , between thumb and pinky . Spider 's face crimped . So ? Years later , she would sketch him like that : the young Rembrandt scrunching up , incredulous , in the light of the mirror 's report . So I do n't want wires anywhere near my head . You 're kidding me . Spider laughed . Get out of my life . Does n't ... do n't wires make a magnetic field or something ? Stevie reasoned with her . You 've used a Walkman , have n't you ? I 've never let my head anywhere near a Walkman . I do n't even like saying the word . Spider answered with a marvelous sound : a rapid click of the tongue against hard palate . The sound the neighborhood boys ' baseball cards made once , rubber-banded to bicycle spokes . The noise of the industrious world engine , impatient for its next run . She put the glasses on and waited for the view , like a Louisville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her virgin sight about to be forever despoiled . Her eyes looked through the tinted lenses , not knowing what to expect . And they saw nothing at all . Hold it . Hang on . Spider stood between her and Spiegel , sporting his own set of glasses . He swayed , waving and clicking a thing that looked like a TV remote . We 're snagged on something . The trio stood staring at a blank wall . Spider Lim made the ratchet noise . Adie had to keep from slugging him with pleasure . Do that again ! What ? Do what ? Nothing 's started yet . That thing with your tongue . Spider , lost to the problem , ignored her . His life 's work : already to be someplace else by the time anyone else got there . He temporized . We 've gone over to a new configuration . Just this week . A separate graphics engine for each wall . It 's causing us some sync problems . The white is pretty , Adie offered . Here we are . Here goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse of emptiness cleared . Up from a hidden seam in the whiteness , a stone slab emerged : a chunk of burnished marble chiseled with text , something Herod would have slapped up on an imperial stele to appall the natives , as deep into rebellious Judaea as he could get away with . The plaque twirled about in space before settling back down in midair , to be read . That spinning stone even cast real shadows . No sooner did Spider land the first slab than he hooked another . The second plaque flopped out of the wall and pirouetted in space in front of Adie . She fought the urge to reach out and pinch it . More stone tablets materialized from on high . They fell into formation alongside one another , forming the beveled buttons of a menu . A floating finger moved upon this list , a disembodied digit that tracked the waves of Spider 's wand . From the several choices , he selected a slab labeled Crayon World . Here we go , he said . Hold on now . He clicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receded , as if really pressed . The menu beeped and dissolved . For a moment , the walls went dark . When they lit again , they were no longer walls . A hailstorm of aquamarines filled Adie 's vision , a shower of silver-blue shards , as if the air had just shattered . Then the shards condensed , reassembling into a blue ceiling . The three of them stood in their own bodies , under a blazing sky . Yet they floated above the scene they looked at , canted at an impossible angle . Adie 's knees buckled . She pitched forward , compensating for this snub to gravity . When she righted herself , so did the Crayon World below . Another cloudburst of topazes and Adie began to make out the place where they 'd landed . Her gaze zoomed and panned , as dazed as an infant 's eyes sifting their first light . No sooner did she right herself than nausea upended her again . She felt as she always had , on those five-thousand-mile childhood flights around the world to yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this was the very opposite of motion sickness : still-illness , frozen in a yawing landscape that bobbed all around her . Adie , now a cartoon of herself , stood treading on an invisible magic carpet . She , Steve , and Spider walked the plank above a seething grass sea . Only there was no plank , and the grass was no more than scribbles of crayon . She looked up . The teal tent above them now billowed with cloud . She looked down at her shoes . They skimmed over the tops of trees , trees rooted well beneath the floor that projected them . Each crayon image slid seamlessly over the room 's corners , erasing all sense of the cubicle that they inhabited . A few trillion bits of math , to fool a few billion years of ocular evolution : after a few seconds , Adie stopped noticing the conjuring act and began to believe . Here , Spider said . You drive . And he thrust the wand into her hands . Where 's the clutch on this thing ? She never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jabbing at the buttons with her thumbs . The world 's RPMs raced , and a burp rippled through its crayon portrait . The stand of would-be blue spruce they threaded went masts down and keel to heaven . She swung the wand hard to the right . She and the men banked back in the opposite direction . What 's that ? she whispered , afraid the thing might bolt . That . There . It just moved . God only knows , Steve whined . That 's our problem . Millions of dollars of funding , and nobody around this dump can draw worth squat . His voice seemed to come from just to her left , though Adie would never again trust her sense of distance . As she turned to look at him , the Crayon World wrapped around her , tracking her head . Spiegel 's grin leaked out from under his own pair of wraparound glasses . Go on and follow it , if you like . Adie squeezed the wand and steered away . In three short bursts , she put half a moraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right next to her , meadow for meadow , bog for bog . What are those things supposed to be : cattails ? bulrushes ? What in the world is that Douglas fir doing over there , all by itself ? Stevie threw back his head and snickered . Some chassis-jockey must have drawn that one . They have all the visual intelligence of a myopic , right-hemisphere-damaged eight-year-old loose with his first sixty-four-color box . Spider Lim just smiled at the coder 's taunt . Like software knows how to draw any better ? But it 's fantastic , Adie demurred . Change one ... one mark on it and I 'll kill you in your sleep . Pixel , Spider corrected . Change one pixel . And you 'll kill us . Voxel , Spiegel overtrumped him . Keep current , will you , Lima ? Voxel or boxel . A 3-D pixel . How come you did n't paint the backs of anything ? I mean , look at this stump . A very funky mahogany , although I do like the Cubist growth rings . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white . That 's the paper , Spider apologized . The paper ? The paper we drew them on . Yeah . We were too bloody lazy to ... Hardware elbowed software in the floating rib . This particular world is not really about painting the stump , you know . It 's about getting the head-position tracking to work ... With the Kalman filtering ... Not to mention the human head ... While doing these massive bit-blits from one graphics array area to another at sufficiently high speeds and resolutions to Look , look ! A house . Did you know there was a little house out there ? Do n't you boys snort at me . Can we walk behind it ? Does the world go back that far ? Look ! Flowers . What ? Tul , no iri How many times we got ta tell you ? You 're not dealing with bloody Pick-ax-o here ... Oh God ! Adie shouted . Little bees . And they 're buzzing ! Crude black-and-golden scraps with loops of straightened paperclip wings jittered about in organized confusion . Something turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as buzzing and robotic as the living original . They like it around the flowers . Steve pointed off into a glade . Try waving the wand over there . She did . The magic scraps of would-be bees swarmed after every trail of digital scent she laid down willy-nilly . Adie soared and looped and rolled . Each time she cocked her head , the trailing wires that tracked her goggles pulled the whole landscape along in her sight 's wake . She waved the magic wand through ever more elaborate wingovers and Immelmanns . She skimmed above the trees and plowed through furrows between the grass blades . She navigated out to the farthest walls of this confinement and jiggled the ground beneath her feet with her giggling . You like it , then ? Steve demanded . You really like it ? I never dreamed ... I 've never seen anything like it . Outside the Cavern , beyond the enveloping lab , past the research park 's camouflaging cedar shingles , out on the fringe of the coastal forest , the hurt of a screech owl skipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long-haul commerce whipped its errand trucks up and down the evacuated coast road , hard as scythes . But inside this womb of cool engineering , ingenuity schooled its hatchlings by moonlight . You 'll come in with us , then ? Steve asked Adie . You want to play ? Some part of her had never wanted anything else . Had never hoped for more than to play in such a place , or even in its ugly machine imposture . The three of them strolled out of the paper meadows and walked back into real weather . They left the high-tech monastery , stepping out into the actual night . It seemed to be seedtime , early in the curve of the world 's regeneration . Say it was raining . A wrap of mist condensed on their clothing , coating them in a fine glaze . A few scared birds clicked and whistled in the night , to find themselves out . They stood together in the dark parking lot , next to the rental car that was to take Adie back to her tepee-shaped theme hotel down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geode key ring . Spiegel leaned on the rental , awaiting her answer . Klarpol , for her part , could not stop laughing , shaking her head side to side in disbelief at what she 'd just seen . Images built and broke inside her . For the first time in as long as she cared to remember , the future held more pictures than the past . Stevie , it 's amazing . But I ca n't . I really ca n't . What does that mean , exactly ? What , indeed ? The very weather , that first night , interrogated her , dared her to say exactly what she had sworn off . And the wider box of eveningthe scrim of midnightmocked all her available replies . It 's not paint , he said . No paint involved at all . No original expression required , Ade . It 's all drawing by numbers , out here . Do n't think of it as art . Think of it as a massive data structure . What SoHo does n't know wo n't hurt it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mental pulldown menu . None held water except the last : a general hatred for all things that the cabled world hoped to become . Yet something tugged at her . Something darting and striped and buzzing . Those bees , she answered him . How do they know how to find those flowers ? How do you get them to fly like that ? Something in those jittery black-and-golden scraps recalled her sight 's desire . So it always went , with life and its paler imitations . The things that needed renouncingour little acts of abdication , our desperate Lentsfinally caved in . They slunk off , subdued by hair of the dog , their only cure . The abandoned palette returned to press its suit , sue for time , advocate . All Adie had ever wanted was to people this place with gentian and tree rings and hidden houses folded from out of cardstock , to raise stalks under an animated sky , a sky calling out for glade-crazed , pollinating paper honeybees that followed every trail of scent that the wave of thought 's wand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy bitheads . She looked up , helpless , ready , her wet eyes seeing everything .
