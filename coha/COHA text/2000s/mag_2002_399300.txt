COLORADO SCOUTS RELIVE THE LEGACY OF MILITARY LEGENDS Photograph Troop 465s Jae Cauble tests out his snowshoes on the same slopes that tested the soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division 60 years before ( inset photo ) . Photograph // Under a cloudless , starry Colorado sky , the temperature overnight had plunged to 26 degrees below zero . As the 1,200 Scouts awoke to the sun rising over the Gore Mountains , it was still so cold that it felt as though bare fingers could snap right off . Yet , despite the conditions on that frizen morning last February , the guys looked pretty chipper . " Hey , it was great , " Life Scout Zachary Waite of Troop 637 in Sedalia , Colo. , says . " It was probably minus 20 in my tent , but I was really warm . " Zachary had the right snow gear for Klondoree 2002 . Plus , he and the other Scouts had a powerful and historic motivator to help get them through the night-the legacy of the soldiers of the famed 10th Mountain Division . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , soldiers lived and trained on this very spot at Camp Hale , near Leadville , Colo . Although it 's been almost 60 years since the original troops of the 10th called these hills home , Scouts , were shocked to discover just what kind of trail they had blazed for soldiers and for outdoorsmen . Talk About Cold The first soldiers of the 10th spent three long , cold winter months living outdoors at 9,400 feet above sea level , with only canvas tents to protect them from the wicked elements . That 's because those in command wanted the men to get toughened to living in winter conditions . Their tents could n't keep out the icy wind , so many soldiers built snow shelters called " quinzees . " ( See " Nice and Comfy " sidebar , page 24 . ) They were training to fight the Nazis , but not with traditional military methods . Soldiers of the 10 th learned to fight in the hostile , rugged world of winter mountain terrain . ( See " Winter Warfare " sidebar . ) Techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Afghanistan . " We were doing this for just one weekend , " Zachary says . " We thought it was kind of amazing how they had to stay out here for three months ! " There were reminders everywhere of a time when the entire world was at war . Young men barely older than these Scouts prepared to fight and die for their country . Tried and True As temperatures rose into the 30 's , Scouts reenacted drills that the men of the 10th performed . Second Class Scout Ryan Sanderson , Zachary and other members of Troop 637 supervised snowhoeing , marksmanship , knot tying , signaling , mule packing ( on llamas ) and fire starting with flint and steel . " While skill was important , one troop leader reminded his struggling team : " What this is really all about is teamwork , leadership and problem solving . " One Scout pushed wood shavings and bits of steel wool into a pile . Another struck the flint . The rest stood , using their backs as a windbreak.They all held their breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tiny spark leaped , and a feeble flame flickered and faded . A puff of smoke floated into the clear , crisp blue air . Fire followed . A Snowy Reminder A tall Scout in an authentic World War II battle uniform of olive-drab wool pants , long wool coat and leather boots walked by , clapping his hands just to make sure they were still attached . A 1945 Studebaker M29C Weasel , the granddaddy of today 's Snow Cats , wheezed and puffed its way along the mountain , the ancient engine coughing in the cold . There were more men , young and old , dressed all in white-caps , loose canvas coats , baggy pants . They seemed to disappear against the backdrop of snow . Ghosts ? No . These were veterans of the 10th Mountain Division . They had come to share their memories , including their white camouflage uniforms . Members of Troop 637 also wore the white camo .

It became the standard , then as today . Also , the soldiers learned to drink extra water to avoid dehydration , eat high-calorie foods and build stamina with strenght conditioning-all remarkably simple , basic survival techniques . Most importantly , the 10th initiated winter combat skills and equipment , using wooden snowshoes , long heavy skis and packs weighing up to 95 pounds .

" The manuals these guys wrote in 1942-43 about mountain warfare have the same basic techniques used today , " David Little , president of the 10th Mountain Division Living History Display Group , says . The experienced snow campers among the Scouts knew these survival skills by heart , but they had no idea the men of the 10th Mountain Division were so instrumental in developing these procedures . First Class Scout Phil Diamond says , " I think we had it kind of easy when you think about what they had to do . " Photograph NICE AND COMFY A quinzee is a snow hut . While it can keep you alive in freezing cold , a badly built one could collapse and possibly kill you . The Scouts at the 2002 Klondoree at Camp Hale , Colo. learned the right way . " First , you pile up snow about six feet high and wait two or three hours for it to harden , " Life Scout Zachary Waite says . " Then you start digging . And digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the builder scrapes in six inches and then up six inches . As the hole in the snow mound grows , he slides in and continues to dig , always on his belly , always six inches in and then six inches up . And always with a buddy nearby . By digging facedown , the digger ensures that there will be an air pocket below him so that he can survive until he is dug out , should the snow mound collapse . The Scouts were reminded often of a man who died when he was buried while digging face up . " If you start thinking about how it could collapse on you , " Zachary says , " you could get nervous . " As for warmth , Scouter Al Burt , who spent two nights in a quinzee during the Klondoree , boasts that while Scouts in nylon tents felt the bite of minus 15 to 20 degree temperatures , his snow cave was a comparably toasty 35 degrees .

Sidebar WINTER WARFARE Sidebar Early in World War II , U.S. military leaders realized they needed specially trained troops to defeat German soldiers entrenched in the Apennine Mountains of northern Italy .
