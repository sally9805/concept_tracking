<p> FORGIVENESS MUST FOLLOW REPENTANCE <p> Editor  --  Repentance is never perfect . It is always partial and incomplete . The pope 's recent act of repentance for the sins and errors of Roman Catholics is a good , though defective , act . He acknowledges the evil and wrong done by some in the name of Christ . <p> Some Jews , homosexuals and women will not forgive the pope because the repentance was not full and complete . It is noteworthy that some Jews will never forgive anyone connected to the Holocaust , some gays and women will never forgive their oppressors . Forgiveness , like repentance , is also never perfect . <p> Archbishop Desmond Tutu has it right . There is no future without forgiveness . Lives are bitter and scarred when people can neither repent nor forgive . <p> ROBERT WARREN CROMEY <p> Rector , Trinity Church <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> INSPIRING FIRST STEP <p> Editor  --  The recent confession by Pope John Paul II of the myriad sins and injustices committed by the church over the past two millennia in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just for Roman Catholics but for all Christians and people of good will . <p> Since confession is the first step in a process of true reform , we eagerly await the specific changes the Roman pontiff will undertake to implement such reformation . <p> Rev. Dr. JOHN H. ELLIOTT <p> University Lutheran Chapel <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> A GREATER REALITY <p> Editor  --  Thank you for a great article on Charlie Liteky ( " A Matter of Honor , " March 14 ) . <p> I have never met Charlie , but I have done much advocacy work to try and close the School of the Americas . So your story hits close to home . People trying to close the SOA are made to look like extremists , impractical and out of touch with the reality of the world today . <p> I was at Fort Benning last November with eight students and three staff members from the University of San Francisco . We joined over 10,000 people gathered to witness against the SOA . Many of them were students from universities and high schools . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco , I again felt isolated from the majority of the people around me who do not want to hear about the SOA . To be with like-minded individuals , I belong to the School of the America 's Watch West ( SOAWW ) , which meets monthly at the Unitarian Universalist Church in San Francisco . <p> Your article showed that opposing U.S. policies regarding defense spending and allocations is not out of touch with reality , but in touch with a greater reality and integrity : to challenge our government to respond ethically to the globalization of our world . Hopefully , Charlie 's story can give courage to others to do likewise . <p> Fr . JOHN SAVARD , S.J. <p> Associate Director <p> University Ministry <p> University of San Francisco <p> ANOTHER BARBARITY <p> Editor  --  I found Debra Saunders ' tirade ( March 14 ) , against Darrell Rich even more offensive than usual . By the people she refers to as his " groupies , " I suppose she means those of us who think the death penalty is immoral , racially biased , unjustly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could I forgive this man for his acts of brutality against helpless women and a child ? Would I want to see him back in the society that he so cruelly violated ? But do I think we , as a society , should take " an individual rendered helpless and inflict physical and emotional pain " on him ( the U.N . ' s definition of torture ) ? No , no and no . <p> My heart goes out to the victims and their families for the living nightmare they have endured . I do n't expect them to forgive or forget  --  I know I never could . But does killing him accomplish anything other than bringing us down to his level ? <p> We have a viable alternative in life without possibility of parole . Keeping him locked up and out of society , which some think is even crueler than execution , does n't bother me at all . Perpetuating the cycle of violence by repeating his barbarity bothers me a great deal . Ms. Saunders ' taunts and jeers at a condemned man who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purports to abhor . <p> VIRGINIA VAN ZANDT <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> FACING DEADLY THREAT <p> Editor  --  The two readers who are troubled by the verdict handed down by the Diallo jury and the legal standard it used to arrive at that judgment have it wrong : Using deadly force against another person in defense of one 's life is not an " execution "  --  even if it later comes to light that the other person , in fact , was unarmed and posed no threat . Police officers in these circumstances are judged on the reasonableness of their actions based on the information they had at the time of the encounter , not on the ultimate facts determined minutes , days or months later . <p> I can tell you from personal experience , and from the experiences of my colleagues in the department , that the realization that you are facing a deadly threat is both instantaneous and unequivocal . There are no gray areas . Factors such as the race or sex of the other person are not even part of the equation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to your training and your instinct for self-preservation . <p> You need to walk in a police officer 's shoes for a while before judging him . I would invite these two readers and others to do so by enrolling in the Citizen 's Police Academy offered by the SFPD . There they will have a chance to learn about our training and also test their own split-second decision-making skills with our state-of-the-art firearms video training system . It 's a lot harder than it looks . <p> MARK LUNDIN <p> San Francisco Police Department <p> . <p> CENSUS 94610 <p> Editor  --  Monday I received my census forms in the mail . After hearing radio ads and television commercials stating how important it is to answer the census , I was very dismayed to see the form has my address in the city of Piedmont . I live in Oakland . The address is correct except for the city . I imagine that this is one of the ways that people are under- and overcounted . <p> If government funds are distributed by census figures , Oakland will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am not the only person with this problem . My guess is that the whole 94610 ZIP code will be counted as Piedmont , and possibly 94611 , which shares a ZIP code with Piedmont as well . <p> I hope that someone in the census department can correct this error , but I have a feeling that they will consider the count as " close enough for government work . " Since the forms will be read by computer , it will do no good to make the change on the form itself . And I 'm sure any clerk who might see the corrected form would not have the inclination or authority to question the reason for the change . Maybe they can get it right for the next census . They will have 10 years to figure it out . <p> GREGG COOK <p> Oakland <p> . <p> RENTERS PAY TOO <p> Editor  --  I can no longer tolerate the simplemindedness of those who assert that renters pay no property tax . Two letter writers to the Chron stated that March 13 , in defense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a large percentage of the electorate in this state . Do I pay property taxes ? You bet I do  --  not the owners of the duplex I live in . <p> I pay $1,000 a month for the privilege of inhabiting an 875-square-foot space . This pays for the owners ' taxes , repairs , mortgage and interest , property manager and quarterly gardeners ' fees , while still providing a profit . Let 's be clear about that  --  while my payment is not direct , the annual fees to the county come out of my pocket , not the absentee owners ' . Any increase in the owners ' expenses is passed directly along to me . I 'm paying my fair share , while the landlords are coasting . Just the reverse of the " received wisdom " of Misters Spitze and Hippard . <p> As for those who think that Proposition 13 's super majority requirement for the approval of " new " taxes is a good idea , I would suggest that they think of it in sports terms  --  in order for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al. , to win any " new " games they will now have to beat another team by more than a 2-to-1 margin . Is this fair ? As Jerry Lee Lewis used to say , " Think about it , darlin ' . " <p> LEIGH HILL <p> Santa Cruz <p> . <p> THE BLAME IS ON US <p> Editor  --  It 's most amusing to me to read the outcry about high gasoline prices . Blame is focused on the reduced oil supply . Blame someone , anyone else . It 's become the American Way . But are n't we to blame ? We decided to purchase the SUV , the four-wheel-drive truck , the more powerful V-8 or V-6 engine instead of the adequate four-cylinder . We embraced the hype that bigger is better . Seems that decision was short-sighted . Look in the mirror , America . There 's the person to blame . <p> JON SIRRINE <p> San Rafael
