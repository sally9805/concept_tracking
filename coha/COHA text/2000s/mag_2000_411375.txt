A new orbiting camera delivers spy-quality photos and bares the secrets of foreign dictators and the guy next door . // At first glance it is n't a very impressive picture . If you did n't know better you might mistake it for a souvenir photo from a helicopter sightseeing trip around Manhattan . It is only when you take a closer look and recognize the different types of vintage aircraft on the flight deck of the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum that you realize you are viewing something truly spectacular . See those tiny white streaks on the street next to the dock where the retired carrier is berthed ? Those are the white lines on 12th Avenue . Move over a few blocks to the east to Times Square and follow Broadway toward Central Park to the corner of 57th Street . Here , somewhat hidden in the shadows , you 'll find the roof of the building that POPULAR MECHANICS calls home . What makes this " aerial photo " important is n't what it reveals but how it was taken . You are looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in space . Until now , only the elite of the intelligence community had seen the world so clearly from so far away . For about $2000 , Space Imaging of Thornton , Colo. , will point and click its Ikonos spy-in-the-sky satellite just about anywhere you ask , from an ultrasecret North Korean missile base to your next-door neighbor 's swimming pool . Sharper And Sharper Photos taken from space are old news . For decades environmental scientists and urban planners have been able to get a handle on the " big picture " with 30-meterresolution images like those shown on page 83 . The next improvement came with the advent of 5-meter imaging . The leap from 5- to 1-meter-resolution means Ikonos can distinguish among objects that are approximately 3 ft. ( a meter is a little more than 3 ft. in length ) across . You might not be able to see whether your neighbor swims in the buff , but you will be able to tell whether he does the breast stroke or doggie paddle . In several respects , 1 meter represents a magic number for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution for making an accurate map . You can see the white lines on a street , " says John Copple , chief executive officer of Space Imaging , during our visit to the company 's headquarters . Adding color to a 1-meter image makes something more spectacular happen . Suddenly , uncertain structures become as clear as the face you shave every morning . You do n't just see the airport , you can see whether the passenger loading ramps are pulled alongside the planes . " With 1-meter color you 're talking about using the spatial processing system that God gave you , " says Copple . For many applications , including crop planning , traffic planning and disaster relief , there is no longer the need for a trained photo interpreter to explain what the camera has recorded . What you see is what you get . Fast Retakes In addition to providing civilians with the best space images ever , Ikonos can deliver them fast . Riding an orbit that takes it over the north and south poles , the satellite can look down at any place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This timeliness means that farmers can use close-ups to monitor the health of crops and better estimate yields , " explains Space Imaging spokesperson Linda Lidov as she escorts PM into the company 's satellite control room . It is a modest , gray space about the size of a finished basement in a typical suburban home , divided into a half dozen deskheight work areas . Operators sit before computer monitors , their backs to a waist-to-ceiling window that runs the length of the wall separating the control room from the reception area . They face a pair of pull-down movie screens . One displays a spreadsheet-like grid with " tasking " instructions that tell where the satellite should be aimed next . The other screen displays a map of the world superimposed with the satellite 's orbit and present location . A tiny skull and crossbones in the South Pacific catches our attention . " That 's where we think the first satellite went down , " says Lidov. // Even with the loss of that first Ikonos satellite due to a launch failure in 1999 , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Military and intelligence space satellite budgets are , of course , classified , but those who are knowledgeable about such things estimate that this is about as much as Uncle Sam spends each week to maintain his fleet of spy satellites . And now Ikonos is being used to challenge threat assessments based on images from these intelligence satellites . Recently , the Federation of American Scientists ( www.fas.org ) published 1-meter images of a North Korean missile site that clearly shows that an alleged ICBM base is less advanced than the CIA has claimed . Upping The Contrast Photograph Skeptical of CIA claims that North Korea had advanced ICBMs that could reach the United States , the Federation ofAmerican Scientists purchased 1-meter Ikonos images showing a relatively primitive and poorly maintained missile site . Photograph Images can be draped on elevation maps , creating flight simulator-like 3D environments . // We pull up a chair alongside one of the workstations and see what is happening upstairs . " Products are delivered as 11-bit black-and-white images . This corresponds to 2048 shades of gray per pixel , compared to 256 shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains Lidov . More data means more detail in shadows and brightly lit areas . To illustrate this point , Bryan McFadden , manager of product applications , calls up an image of an ice sheet . As an 8-bit image it appears stark white . Displayed in 11 bits , the shadows cast by the windblown snow stand out as clearly as the detail on an Ansel Adams landscape . At another workstation , Randy Owen , manager of systems operations , prepares to aim Ikonos at the Mayon Volcano , 215 miles southeast of Manila in the Philippines . Hours before PM 's visit in late February , the volcano had begun spewing lava and ash . The 8118-ft. volcano , which had erupted 45 times since 1616 , is a major tourist attraction because of its textbook-perfect cone . If the eruption continues , rill and vapor " clouds will obscure the view from space . The image that the satellite captures could be critical to planning evacuation routes . As we walk through the computer rooms where individual images are stored on hundreds of CDs , Lidov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The company 's investors , affiliates and strategic partners are the same people who , for all intents and purposes , created the spy satellite industry . Chief among them are defense giants Lockheed Martin and Raytheon , which built and launched Ikonos and operate key parts of this operations center . Clearly , the most impressive piece of technology is the Kodak camera aboard the Ikonos satellite . To provide the required reflective characteristics , the telescope 's mirrors had to be finished to atomic-level smoothness . " Opticians shaped the telescope 's 28-in. - dia. primary mirror so perfectly that if it were enlarged to 100 miles in diameter , you could drive that distance and not hit any bumps higher than eight-hundredths of an inch , " brags a Kodak spokesman . " Optical precision of this magnitude is what enables this camera system to produce the highestquality imagery . " An equally challenging problem was to make the camera light enough to fly into space . To reduce the weight of the primary mirror , Kodak cut a honeycomb pattern into its core using abrasive waterjet technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across about a 7mile stretch of the Earth 's surface . A digital processing unit compresses and formats the imagery for transmission to Space Imaging 's ground stations located around the globe . " Customers can order images of any geographic location in the world , " says Conrad Mueller , Space Imaging 's vice president for international sales and marketing . In fact , some images can even be purchased over the Internet . " Our only limitation is cloud cover .
