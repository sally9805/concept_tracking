A six-week trial of ginkgo , touted to enhance memory , found no improvement in memory , learning or concentration among healthy people with no neurological symptoms , compared with a similar group taking placebo capsules . A separate study of colon-cancer patients revealed that St. John 's wort , used to fight depression , interferes with the potentially beneficial effects of irinotecan , a widely prescribed chemotherapy drug . <P> ANTHRAX DOUBLE DUTY Researchers may have uncovered an inventive way of both battling anthrax and detecting its microscopic spores . By studying a virus that can invade and attack the anthrax bacillus , scientists isolated an enzyme , called lysin , that breaks apart the cell 's walls , causing it to die . Early work in mice looks promising , though any potential drug based on this discovery would have to be administered immediately after exposure , before the anthrax germ had released its toxins . In addition , scientists have found that lysin could be a useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anthrax in samples of air or from exposed surfaces . And it yields results faster than current methods . <P>  --  By Alice Park <P> Sources : Journal of the American Medical Association , Journal of the National Cancer Institute , Nature
