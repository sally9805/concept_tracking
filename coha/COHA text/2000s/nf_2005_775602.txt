Kings and potentates , and their queens and lovers , someday die and have to be entombed , interred , or consumed on splendid pyres. // So too with performers  --  even the greatest among them , the true superstars . Elvis died , and Garbo , and Marilyn Monroe , and Frank Sinatra . Elvis at least left us Graceland , his Taj on Old Man River ; of the others we have merely records and movies , recorded performances that allow us at least distant glimpses of their gaiety , their beauty , their gifts . Show business imposes its own strict temporality : no matter how many CDs or DVDs we own , it would still have been better to have been there , to have seen the living performers in the richness of their being and to have participated , however briefly , in the glory of their performance . // When I was eight years old , I was sitting in a hot pickup near Silverton , Texas , bored stiff , waiting for my father and two of my uncles , Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was reading a book called Last of the Great Scouts , by Helen Cody Wetmore , Buffalo Bill Cody 's sister . At the time I was more interested in the Lone Ranger than in Buffalo Bill Cody , but when my father and my uncles finally returned to the pickup , my Uncle Roy noticed the book and reminded Uncle Charlie that they had once seen Cody . This had occurred in Oklahoma , near the end of Cody 's life , when he had briefly merged his Wild West with the Miller Brothers ' 101 Ranch show . Both agreed that Cody , an old man at this time , had n't actually done much ; mainly he just rode around the arena on his white horse , Isham , waving to the crowd . // Still , there was Buffalo Bill Cody , one of the most famous men in the world , and they had seen him with their own eyes . // Sixty years have passed since that hot afternoon in Silverton . I mainly remember the heat in the pickup  --  but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veer much from the strict path of commerce , did perk up a bit when they remembered that they had actually seen Buffalo Bill Cody ride his white horse around an arena in Oklahoma . And like millions of others , they had made a trip precisely for that purpose , such was Cody 's fame . //
