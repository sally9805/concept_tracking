Section : Exit Strategy <p> When four friends started IRIS on a lark , they did it their way . They never appointed a CEO . And they agreed to sell the company  --  the sooner the better . Eight years , 50 employees , and four attempts later , they 've finally succeeded <p> IF YOU WERE A HOLLYWOOD SCRIPTWRITER WORKING on a plot about four young friends who go into business together , you 'd want to drive about 45 minutes outside L.A. to visit a little software company started by , well , four young friends . The story of Maggie Etheridge , Eddie Ureno , Dan Woolley , and Greg Robertson  --  the founders of IRIS ( #192 )  --  is a drama replete with office romance , heroic leading men and women , supernatural acts , a Justice Department investigation , jealousy , a multimillion-dollar stock deal , and maybe , just maybe , a happy ending . <p> Even the " characters " seem made for the big screen . Maggie is the emotional , smoky-voiced " soul " of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology whiz . ( Kevin Costner ? ) Eddie is the silent but strong operations chief . ( Andy Garcia ? ) And Greg , the larger-than-life sales star at IRIS , says he wants to play himself . <p> Even without a movie deal , one thing 's for sure : there 's been no lack of conflict at IRIS  --  starting with the four founders themselves . From their business philosophies to their religious beliefs ( which range from fervent Christian to agnostic ) to their temperaments , they are about as different as four people can be . Different but equal . To this day , the four partners are equal in every way : pay , equity , rank . No one is CEO . No one has the last word . The unusual arrangement has been their greatest strength and at times their undoing . So contentious are they that they sometimes come across more like a jury than a management team . <p> They have , however , always agreed on their exit strategy : sell the company . At least three of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greg , the gung-ho salesman , was the lone holdout . In fact , he was against the plan as late as April , when IRIS , based in Anaheim Hills , Calif. , began a second round of talks with a competitor that looked to be the perfect parent . " My attitude was always , We 've got to make this company happen ourselves , " Greg says . That 's because , he admits , " I never thought anyone would ever buy us . " <p> THE FIRST SUITOR CAME KNOCKing a few years after the company had been founded  --  or more accurately , after the company just sort of happened . In 1992 , Maggie and Eddie were dating . One night they had a long conversation about Maggie 's mom , a real estate agent . Mom was having software problems with a new multiple listings system ( MLS ) . Anyone who 's bought a house knows that real estate agents depend on their MLS for printouts of properties for sale . Hundreds of different multiple listings systems exist across the country ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two Maggie 's mom was using in southern California were no romp on the beach . <p> Being the dutiful daughter she was , Maggie wanted to help her mother by writing a better MLS access program . Eddie , who was crazy about Maggie , jumped at the chance to help her . " She did n't want to start a business ; she just wanted to do it for her mom , " he says . But he was more pragmatic . " I said , ' No , we 're not just going to write it for your mom . ' " Besides , starting a company meant he and Maggie could spend more time together . Maggie quickly recruited their friend Dan the programmer . <p> Providence provided their start-up funds . Maggie , Eddie , and Dan were all working for the same court-reporting-software firm in Irvine , Calif . A customer commissioned them to do a software project on the side . The freelance job paid $7,000  --  enough to buy them equipment and time . <p> The software that they eventually designed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browsers do for Web surfers . But back then they had no idea whether the program would sell . Or even how to sell it . They thought about the people they knew . Eddie remembered his old college buddy Greg Robertson , who 'd gone into sales . Over beers at a Newport Beach bar , Eddie made his case to Greg . But Greg remained skeptical until April 21 , 1992  --  the night everyone met for dinner at Maggie 's house . " Maggie 's a dreamer , " notes Eddie . And her dream sounded good to three young people disillusioned with work . The guys were all 24 . Maggie was the oldest at 27 . <p> They thought of themselves as " four punks " who were " up against the man "  --  the large MLS companies that controlled access to their listings . Dan gleefully set out to crack the code . He remembers the eerie feeling he had when , after operating in stealth mode for a year , the four unveiled their first product , Lightning , at a trade show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the parking lot , and I thought , ' Better watch my back , ' " he says . <p> Management experience ? " No one had any , " says Dan . They arrived at their job duties " organically . " Maggie , who saw her mother in every customer , was the natural choice to head up training and customer support . Her easygoing boyfriend , Eddie , agreed to take care of operations , which , at first , consisted of finding his way around Maggie 's garage . Dan , the programmer extraordinaire , showed a flair for business strategy . Greg was a one-man selling band . He 'd load up his ' 67 van with product and drive off with instructions not to return until the van was empty . He did what he was told , and it all started to click . <p> Still , none of the partners thought the company would last more than 18 months . When it did , " we started to think we were golden , " says Maggie . " We were unstoppable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maggie recounts the darkest hour : IRIS received a threatening letter from one of the large MLS companies demanding that IRIS stop selling its software . " We were scared , " she admits . Then two things happened that Maggie likens to " acts of God . " First a phone call came out of the blue from a woman who represented a large group of real estate agents in Omaha . She wanted 100 copies of the software , which then sold for $99.95 a copy . And then , miracle of miracles , a lawyer took pity on the four and worked at a discount to help them with a variety of legal issues , including fending off possible lawsuits . October 1995 : The first attempt to sell the business <p> A Dallas software company made an offer the foursome could n't refuse . They were at a crucial crossroads . They had yet to hire a single employee , and they were tired . Clearly , they 'd gone as far as they could as a gang of four . Revenues stood at $230,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pockets . Still , says Maggie , " we thought we should take the money and run . " Eddie had visions of sailing to the Bahamas . But there was also a catch : the acquirer wanted complete indemnification from intellectual-property suits . Greg was dead set against the sale for many reasons and fought his partners tooth and nail . " Greg wore us down , and rightfully so , " says Eddie . The deal collapsed . Greg felt vindicated , but the others were dejected . <p> Still they hung on . In February 1996 they hired their first employee . As fast as they had one , they had seven . They could n't hire support staff quickly enough . In the close-knit world of real estate , word of the software spread at one meeting of agents after another . Soon orders were coming from Washington , Texas , and other states . Feeling confident , Maggie and Eddie got married . By 1997 sales had surpassed $1 million , and in 1998 they doubled . February 1999 : The partners ' second attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we could on speed and enthusiasm , " says Dan . " The lack of adult supervision was starting to show . " The partners hired a consulting company , a matchmaker who made introductions to several real-estate-related dot-coms  --  the foursome could see that the future of home selling would be online . But after paying $5,000 for a few leads , they walked away . On their own , they started talking casually to a publicly traded company called HomeSeekers.com , based in Reno , Nev . It was a Web-based MLS seeking to be a one-stop shop for real estate agents , and it had its eye on the more than 50,000 agents using the IRIS access program . The idea of the two companies ' coming together seemed like a natural move for both sides . January 2000 : Their third bid to sell <p> The partners began formal talks with HomeSeekers at a time when dot-com stock prices were still ascending . What was IRIS , with 50 employees and $4 million in 1999 sales , actually worth ? The founders did their own calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get a precise answer from the complicated stock offer HomeSeekers put forth . Still , the deal was enticing . HomeSeekers was then trading at $23 . " All you could see was up , up , up , " Maggie says . <p> And then came March . With HomeSeekers ' stock tumbling , the decision to walk away was unanimous . " We pulled out at $12 , " Maggie relates . Saying no felt good . IRIS finished a record first quarter , with $500,000 in sales in January alone . According to Dan , the partners started to think , " Maybe it 's not luck after luck after luck . Maybe we 're good at this . " However , they also noticed an alarming trend : HomeSeekers ' Web-based solution was inadvertently stealing business from IRIS . April 2000 : Their fourth attempt to sell <p> Maggie , Eddie , Dan , and Greg went back to the negotiating table with HomeSeekers . " The more sour we got on them , the more they decided they needed us , " says Maggie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetened the pot by guaranteeing the IRIS founders that they would receive the equivalent of $9 million in stock . Convinced that the dot-com was undervalued , the IRIS partners felt its stock could potentially be worth a whole lot more , provided that HomeSeekers did n't go belly-up before they could cash out . <p> After penning a letter of intent in early May , both sides dickered relentlessly over the final terms of the acquisition . One of the key sticking points was indemnification . HomeSeekers sought protection from any future lawsuits arising against IRIS . But the IRIS founders balked and eventually reached a compromise . Greg , despite his initial misgivings , emerged as a strong lead negotiator for IRIS . " I wanted to get the deal done but not fast , " he says . July 21 , 2000 : The final sale <p> " We exchanged stock in one risky venture for stock in another risky venture , " Maggie says . Why did she do it ? It 's simple , she says . She fell in love . Not with her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other little companies HomeSeekers has acquired . " There 's a certain group of people I adore , " she says . " The main thing HomeSeekers has given us is this connection to the other companies . " On that point her partners agree , and so does John Giaimo , president of HomeSeekers . " IRIS was essentially the last piece of a puzzle we 've been building for five years now , " he says . <p> The IRIS owners have suffered some postsale blues as they consider their futures together  --  and apart . Giaimo understands . He worked for himself for 15 years before selling his last business to HomeSeekers . " The biggest thing is the fear factor , " he says . " What will happen ? Will I lose my identity ? " <p> INDEED , GREG HAS A HARD TIME EXPLAINING HIS INITIAL reticence about the HomeSeekers deal , except to say , " I like being Greg Robertson , software-company owner . " When his three-year contract ends , he says , he may start another company in a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still married but without kids , are pursuing separate dreams . She talks about going into business with her mother , probably in real estate . But she 's also considering an ice-cream-store franchise . Eddie , meanwhile , is planning to sail off into the sunset  --  literally . He has his eye on buying a 42-foot cruiser . " I 'm serious about sailing , and I think I could do it for a long time , " he says . <p> But for now they are all still fighting the good fight  --  this time to gain a foothold against Homestore.com , the #1 Web site in an industry that 's currently under investigation by the antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice . Whether HomeSeekers and IRIS will make it to the top of their industry is pure speculation . Whether the relationship among the four friends will change  --  now that there 's a parent to mediate it  --  also remains to be seen . <p> In the weeks before the sale , their bond was tested repeatedly . " Whenever I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ' You know what ? It 's really important to have one headstrong person , ' " said Maggie , talking on the phone during one particularly bad " Greg " day . Shortly after the sale , she reported back in . " We still love each other and hate each other , " she said with a laugh . <p> THE FAB FOUR ( clockwise from top right ) : Maggie Etheridge , Eddie Ureno , Dan Woolley , and Greg Robertson <p> MAGGIE AND HER MOM <p> SALES GURU GREG ROBERTSON <p> By Susan Greco <p> <p> Susan Greco ( susan.greco@inc.com ) is a senior writer at Inc . <p>
