" WILL YOU TAKE THE JOB , Mr. Underwood ? " <p> Underwood looked around at the rows of telephone solicitors . Some faced computer screens and spoke into headsets . Others ate at their desks . A few ambled sluggishly toward a door marked " Employee Rest Area . " <p> The office looked like a decent place to work , but Underwood , who really wanted to begin his professional life as something better than a telemarketer , still had questions . " Did you say that your people place calls to all fifty states ? " <p> Mr. Singleton gave a balding nod . He was a bird-like man - beaked nose , diminutive chin , and wide eyes that filled the concave lenses of his glasses . " Also Puerto Rico , Mexico , and Canada , " he added . <p> " And - " Underwood hesitated . This was the one detail of Singleton 's operation that he still had trouble grasping . " Your computer system allows you to place calls on a time delay ? " <p> " More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and still reach prospective customers at six in the evening . " <p> " Dinner time ? " <p> " Prime time ! " Singleton said . " At Singleton Marketing , it 's always prime time ! " <p> " So if I come to work in the morning at eight - " <p> " Nine . You can arrive earlier , but we only require our workers to be here from nine to five . " <p> " So I come in at nine in the morning , I place a call , and someone answers at six in the evening ? " <p> " Precisely ! Prime time ! Dinner hour ! Best time to reach two-income families . " <p> " So I have a conversation with someone who 's not going to hear my voice for nine hours ? " <p> " Exactly ! " <p> " I hear them and they hear me ? " <p> " Just so ! " Singleton beamed . Then , softly , he added , " Of course , all employees sign a contract prohibiting them from using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , if you 're interested , you can start tomorrow . " He gestured toward an empty desk . " We try to retain good people , but when someone feels he has a better future elsewhere , we let him go . Fortunately , most choose to stay . " <p> To the right of the empty desk sat a silver-haired man with tired eyes . To the left was a woman with blond hair and a face that looked as if it had been hung out to dry . <p> " Your neighbors will be Mr. Royal and Ms. Corona . " <p> Underwood glanced at his watch . It was 5:02 . " Should n't they be going home ? " <p> " Some of our people put in extra time , " Singleton explained . " No reason not to . We have excellent facilities . " He gestured toward the rest  --  area door . " And remember , whenever a Singleton solicitor places a call , it 's prime time ! " <p> Underwood soon discovered that telephone solicitation was hopelessly boring work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Royal and the sagging-faced Ms. Corona , he began hatching a scheme to make the system work for him . <p> His plan was simple . At 9:00 A.M. , using the Singleton lines , he telephoned his own apartment . He hoped to reach his future self and get the day 's closing stock reports . Instead , he got Singleton . <p> " What 's going on ? " Underwood asked . " Whatre you doing in my apartment ? " <p> " Taking care of business , Mr. Underwood . " <p> " Where am I ? " <p> " Why , Mr. Underwood , you 're at your desk , placing a call - " <p> " I mean , where am I there ? If you 're in my apartment , where am - ? " <p> " I 'm afraid you 're not here , Mr. Underwood . In fact - " A pause , and then : " I 'm afraid you 're dead . " <p> Underwood realized that the tired-eyed Mr. Royal was staring at him from the next desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not dead on your end , of course . But here , in the six o'clock world of final stock reports , you have become the late Mr. Underwood . " <p> Underwood leaned forward . He felt dizzy . <p> " We ca n't have people making time-shifting calls for personal gain , " Singleton said . " It would wreak havoc with the system , not to mention the space-time continuum . I 'm sorry , Mr. Underwood . If it 's any consolation , there 's still a place for you at Singleton Marketing . " <p> Now Ms. Corona was staring at him too . <p> Singleton 's voice crackled in the headset . " By placing a call to your future self , you forced us to take corrective action . You were - or should I say will be - killed after leaving the office . The death will be painless and swift . You did n't - that is you wo n't - see it coming . However , if you choose to never leave the office - " <p> Royal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Singleton , please - ! " <p> " Cheer up , " Singleton said . " Think of all the people who work for companies in which they have no future . You , on the other hand , have no future except with the company . Welcome to the family , Mr. Underwood ! " <p> The line went dead . <p> " They monitor our calls , " Mr. Royal said . <p> Underwood 's computer scrolled to a new account . Auto dialing kicked back on . A ringing line purred in Underwood 's earpiece . <p> " They had nine hours to get to your apartment before your call went through , " Ms. Corona said . <p> " Cheer up , " Mr. Royal said . " Life here is n't as bad as you might think . " Then , with a dry chuckle , he delivered the punch : " It 's worse . " <p> The line stopped ringing . A voice answered : " Hello . " Dinner dishes clattered . <p> Prime time ! <p> IMG     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
