" Antonio . " Dominic walked to the table and plunked down a bottle of cheap champagne . " I 've decided to name him Antonio . " <br> Malcolm sipped his beer as a chorus of " good choice " rose up from the others . Wally and Raymond Santos glanced Malcolm 's way , as if seeking permission to congratulate Dominic , but Malcolm just kept drinking and let them make up their own minds . After a moment , Wally joined in with a raised glass to the new father , while sixteen-year-old Raymond busied himself cleaning out a thumbnail . <br> Dominic paused behind the head chair . Billy Koenig scrambled out of it , making a quick joke about keeping it warm for him . Dominic thudded into the chair and dropped his burly arms onto the table so hard Malcolm 's beer sloshed . Typical Dominic  --  always throwing his weight around , as if he was already Pack Alpha , not just heir apparent . <br> " A drink for Antonio , " Dominic thundered , his voice reverberating through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , counting bottles . " Vinnie ! Glasses ! " <br> Waiting tables certainly was n't Vincent 's job , but he hopped to it . As Vincent approached , Malcolm held up his empty mug . Vincent paused , but only for a second , then took Malcolm 's glass . Dominic allowed himself only a split-second scowl , but it was enough for Malcolm . It was easy to establish dominance when you were bigger than everyone else . Doing it without that advantage was the real accomplishment . <br> Once the glasses were filled and distributed , Dominic lifted his . " To fatherhood . " <br> Everyone clinked glasses . <br> " Now , how about a wager ? " Dominic boomed . " Take bets on who 'll be the next new father . I 'll pick Malcolm . " A quick grin . " God knows , he 's been trying hard enough . " <br> Malcolm gritted his teeth as the others laughed and called out good-natured jabs . It was his own damned fault . Malcolm had meant to keep his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but two years ago , sitting around this very table listening to Dominic brag about his sons , he 'd announced a pending arrival of his own . . . only to discover a month later , when the child was born , that it was n't his . Since then , everyone knew he 'd been trying , and had n't even sired a daughter.That was his father 's fault  --  difficulty siring children was one family blight Malcolm could n't overcome through sheer strength of will . <br> He had only to look at his father  --  sitting at the next table with the Alpha , Emilio  --  to see the second family blight , a cane resting beside his father 's chair . He bristled , as he always did , at this physical proof of Edward 's weakness . Not just weakness . Cowardice . <br> As a Danvers , Edward had been expected to fight for Alphahood , but when the opportunity arose , he 'd somehow managed to cripple his leg . No one was quite sure how it had happened  --  the story changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury permanently took him out of the line of succession . As a mediocre fighter , Edward had stood no chance of winning an Alpha match , so he 'd intentionally taken himself out of the race . Everyone in the Pack knew it . <br> Malcolm had spent his life wiggling out from under the shadow of his father 's cowardice . And he had . After Dominic , he was now the best fighter in the Pack , and among the mutts , his reputation for ruthlessness surpassed that of every other Pack werewolf . But when his father looked over , there was no pride in his face . Just a lifting of his chin , listening in on the younger men 's conversation , making sure Malcolm was n't saying anything to embarrass him . <br> As they drank the champagne , the cleaning girl stopped by to wipe off their table . She murmured something that was probably meant to be " excuse me , " but her thick accent and whispered voice rendered the words unintelligible . <br> The girl did n't speak more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason Vincent had hired her was because he could pay her half what he 'd pay anyone else , her being a Jap and all . Still , it had to be bad for business . How many ex-GIs came in here , saw her , and turned around and left ? Malcolm was n't sure whether the girl really was Japanese , but it did n't matter . People saw slanted eyes and they saw Pearl Harbor , and five years was n't enough to make anyone forget . <br> The girl paused at Malcolm 's side and lowered her head . Wally grinned and kicked him under the chair . Malcolm leaned back to let the girl wipe his place . Unlike the quick swipe she 'd given the others , she made sure to get every spot , including a few that 'd probably been there for weeks . <br> When the girl finished , she scurried off and intercepted Vincent with Malcolm 's fresh beer . She took it and returned to the table . First she wiped a spot for the mug , then she wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him like a ceremonial chalice . As Malcolm grunted his thanks , snickers raced up and down the table . <br> The girl pointed to the nearly empty bowl of peanuts nearest him . <br> " Sure , " he said . " Fill it up . " <br> When she scampered off with the bowl , Wally hooted . " That girl has it bad , Mal . Gets worse every time we come here . " <br> Malcolm only gulped his beer . <br> " Hey , come on , Mal . Think about it . She waits on you like that in public ? Imagine what she 'd do for you in private . " <br> Another chorus of snickers . <br> " Not my type , " Malcolm muttered . <br> Dominic leaned forward . " Because she 's Japanese ? Nothing wrong with that . From what I hear , they 're damned eager to please , if you know what I mean . " <br> Billy nodded . " Buddy of mine at work has one of them for a girlfriend , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories he tells . Ever heard of geishas ? All their girls learn some of that shit , and they 'll do anything to make a guy happy . Nothing 's too kinky  --  " <br> Dominic cut him short as the girl approached . <br> " What ? " Billy hissed . " She does n't understand English . " <br> " Does n't matter , " Dominic murmured . <br> When she was gone , they started up again , regaling Malcolm with tales of Asian women . <br> " And , " Dominic said as they finished , " unless my nose is wrong , there might be a bonus . " <br> " Just what I need , " Malcolm said . " A slant-eyed Jap brat . " <br> His father looked over sharply , frowning his disapproval . <br> Billy snickered . " You 're going to get a talking-to later , Mal . " <br> Malcolm snorted and pretended it did n't matter . Edward would n't give him a " talking-to . " That implied anger , and Edward never showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him about stereotypes and prejudices , and counsel him to make better choices with his opinions and his language , all the while clearly doubtful that his words were having any impact . Malcolm was a fighter , not a thinker . . . to Edward 's everlasting disappointment . <br> " You should give it a shot , Mal , " Dominic said . " Do n't worry about who the mother is . Look at Ross Werner . His momma was black and you can hardly tell . With us , it 's the male blood that counts . Women . . . " He shrugged . " Just the vehicle . At most you might get a kid with dark hair and dark eyes , but yours are dark enough anyway . Would n't matter . And . . . " He leaned closer . " You never know . A little foreign matter in the mix might be just what your boys need to get the job done . " <br> Malcolm gritted his teeth . Dominic always sounded so sincere , like a big brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like nothing better than to see Malcolm humiliate himself by presenting a half-breed baby to the Pack . <br> As the night wore on , though , and Malcolm drank more beer , he could n't stop thinking about what Dominic had said . Mixing up the bloodline might help . He 'd never tried that . And Ross 's case did suggest the foreign blood would n't show , which was all that mattered . <br> The girl was in the fertile stage of her cycle , and she obviously wanted him . An easy conquest . Plus , if Asian women were as submissive as the others said . . . Malcolm smiled . Submissive was good . Especially if it came from a girl who was in no position to complain if things got out of hand . <br> By the time the group settled the bill , Malcolm had made up his mind . He sent the others on without him , then cornered the girl as she came out of the back storage room . She started , seeing him there , then dropped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " Been a long night , " he said . " Bet you could use a drink . " <br> When she did n't answer , he pantomimed drinking , then pointed from her to himself . " Drink . You . Me . " <br> " I  --  I work , " she said . " Done soon . " <br> " No , babe , you 're done now . Let me handle Vinnie . " <br> He reached for her apron and snapped it off . She gave a shy little smile , then nodded . <br> " Get drink , " she said . " For you . " <br> She took his hand . Hers was tiny , almost birdlike . He wondered how hard he 'd need to squeeze to hear those thin bones snap like twigs . Not very hard , he 'd wager . <br> He turned to let her lead him into the bar , but she stopped at a locked door a few feet down and took out a key . <br> " Room , " she said , gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <br> He smiled down at the girl . " Sure , babe . Whatever you want . " <br> Malcolm sat in a tiny room , empty except for his chair and a sleeping mat . A few candles cast a wavering , sickly light that lined the room with shadows . When the girl went to get his drink , he 'd flicked the light switch , but nothing had happened . <br> That cheap bastard Vincent probably cut off the electricity when he let the girl take the room . Maybe , if the girl was as good as the others claimed she 'd be , he 'd see about " persuading " Vincent to spring for lights and heat up here . Would n't be any inconvenience to him , and the girl sure would be grateful . She 'd leave the welcome mat out for anytime he felt like coming back . <br> The girl slipped from the back room . She 'd changed out of her work clothes and into a white cotton robe with an embroidered belt . Her bare feet seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of her , slender and hesitant , as graceful and defenseless as a doe . Pretty as one , too . Now that he 'd looked past his prejudice , he had to admit she was damned pretty , especially in that white robe , holding a tray like the offering of some virgin priestess . When she bowed before him , the liquid in the glass did n't so much as ripple . He peered at it . The drink was amber , like beer , but clear and . . . steaming . <br> " Tea ? " he said , lip curling . " I do n't drink  --  " <br> " No , no tea , " she said quickly . " Special drink . For you . Make  --  " A meaningful look at the sleeping pad . <br> " Make good . " <br> " Make me good ? " He started to rise . " I do n't need any damned drink to make me good . " <br> " No , no . Please . " She backed away , gaze downcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me good . For you . Make you . . . " She struggled for the word . " Feel better . Make it feel better . For you . " <br> She babbled on some more , waving at the mat , but he got the gist of it . The drink was supposed to make the sex better . He 'd heard of things like that , and as the others had said , these girls were supposed to know all there was to know about pleasing a man . This must be one of their tricks . <br> Malcolm took the drink and sniffed it . Herbs . His werewolf nose did n't detect any taint of anything noxious . He took a sip . Fire burned down his throat , like hundred-proof whiskey . <br> He closed his eyes and shook himself . The heat spread to his groin and he smiled . Not like he needed the help , but sure , why not . He took a bigger sip . <br> " Yes ? " the girl said . <br> He looked up to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swath of pale skin running from her throat , down between her small breasts , over her flat stomach , to the dark thatch below . His cock jumped and he raised the glass in salute . Another sip and she let the robe fall off one shoulder . A third sip , and she dipped the other shoulder , and the robe slid down her body to pool at her feet . For a moment , she stood before him , naked and pale in the wavering candlelight . Then , without a word , she knelt and reached for his zipper . <br> Malcolm rolled over . A moment 's sleep-fog of thinking Why am I lying on the floor ? then he remembered and smiled . Whatever foreign hoodoo that girl had put into his drink , it was something else . He closed his eyes and sighed , the tip of his tongue sliding between his teeth as he stretched . Shit , he hurt , and it had nothing to do with sleeping on the floor . <br> After all those things he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a little slip of a girl like this , he had n't even tried . Could n't be bothered . He 'd just laid back and let her work her magic . He 'd roused himself for a bit of energetic thrusting , but that 'd been the extent of his participation . She 'd done all the work . <br> And work she had . Gave him three damned fine rides . . . maybe even four  --  he 'd been getting hazy near the end . But three times was bragging rights enough . He rolled onto his back and grinned . <br> Whatever was in that drink was some powerful stuff . . . and so was the girl . Masterful , but never dominant , always letting him know he was in charge . After the second time  --  or was it the third ?  --  he 'd thought he was down , but she 'd managed a revival , rubbing , licking , cajoling . . . begging . He felt a fresh surge and leaned back , savoring the memory until he was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and found himself alone . <br> Malcolm grunted and lifted his head . The simple movement felt like tumbling headfirst out of a tree . He steadied himself . When the world stopped whirling , he opened his eyes and peered around the dark room . Where was that girl ? Helluva time to take a piss . <br> A voice wafted in from the adjacent room . A singsong voice . He chuckled . Singing while she sat on the john  --  guess she was still feeling pretty good , too . Maybe she was cleaning up for the next round . Better give her some time ; there 'd be a lot to clean up . As he lay down , a second voice joined the first . He blinked . A radio or record player ? But if there was no electricity up here . . . <br> Malcolm pushed himself up again , so fast this time that he almost blacked out . He wobbled to his feet and had to rest a moment to get his bearings . His first step nearly sent his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . He 'd been hung over worse than this , though . Mind over matter , as with everything else in life . If you have the guts and the will , you can do anything . <br> He closed his eyes and ordered his muscles to obey . Still , it was slow going . His head pounded , and every fiber of his body urged him to lie back down and sleep it off . <br> Finally , he made it to the wall , then inched around to the door . When he reached it , he peered around the corner . The first thing he saw was the wallpaper . Strange white wallpaper with black geometric shapes . He blinked . No , not wallpaper . Someone had drawn on the walls . Drawn . . . symbols . <br> A smell wafted out . Something burning , giving off a sweetish odor so faint even his nose could barely detect it . The voices started up again . Singing , but with no tune . Chanting . <br> There , across the room , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she looked . . . different . There were circles drawn around her breasts and stomach , but that was n't what gave him a start . It was the way she sat , chin high , gaze steady , her poise exuding confidence , no sign of the shy girl he 'd just bedded . <br> The girl 's lips were still . She was n't the one chanting . It was the two women in front of her , their backs to him , one white-haired , one dark . The white-haired one had her head bowed . The other swung a pendulum in front of the girl 's stomach . The girl said something and the dark-haired woman snapped at her . The white-haired woman murmured a few words and the girl sighed , then said something that made both women laugh . The old woman patted the girl 's bare knee and they started chanting again . <br> As Malcolm watched , his legs began to tremble , begging him to go lie back down . When he resisted , the room went hazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , lifting him up , symbols swirling around him . . . <br> A soft growl and he shook the sensation off . Goddamn that drink . First a killer hangover , now hallucinations . That 's what this was  --  a dream or hallucination , caused by the drink . Had to be . His mind set , he stumbled back to the mat and crashed into sleep . <br> Continues ...
