The hunt for another evildoer , ADOLF HITLER , ended on April 30 , 1945 , when the increasingly unstable Nazi leader took his own life in Berlin : <P> Fate knocked at the door last week for Europe 's two fascist dictators . Mussolini , shot in the back and through the head by his partisan executioners , lay dead in Milan . Adolf Hitler had been buried , dead or alive , in the rubble of his collapsing Third Reich ... If he were indeed dead , the hope of most of mankind had been realized . For seldom had so many millions of people hoped so implacably for the death of one man . <P> If they had been as malign as he in their vengefulness , they might better have hoped that he would live on yet a little while . For no death they could devise for him could be as cruel as must have been Hitler 's eleventh-hour thoughts on the completeness of his failure . His total war against non-German mankind was ending in total defeat ... Seldom in human history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificantly monstrous become the absolute head of a great nation . The suffering and desolation that he wrought were beyond human power or fortitude to compute . The bodies of his victims were heaped across Europe from Stalingrad to London . The ruin in terms of human life was forever incalculable . It had required a coalition of the whole world to destroy the power his political inspiration had contrived . <P>  --  TIME , May 7 , 1945
