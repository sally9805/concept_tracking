<p> A woman named principal of the year in 1988 now has scored as the worst principal in the Chicago Public Schools . <p> A " Principals Report Card " survey by the Chicago Teachers Union planted Dyanne Dandridge-Alexander , of Best Practice High School , squarely at the bottom of the heap of 546 schools , with a grade average of 0.00 , a flat " F , " from her teachers . <p> She also scored a total of 6 of 100 on leadership , discipline issues and budgeting . <p> Dandridge-Alexander says her criticism is coming from staff not used to being held accountable for student achievement . She says she 's changing a system that was n't working , as evidenced by poor student test scores , and that has angered some teachers and parents . <p> Her critics have a list of gripes . They complain about a misplaced $60,000 grant check . She 's been picketed by parents who felt left out . Others say she refused to expel a student who held a letter opener to a student 's throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for individual students . <p> And teachers say she wo n't share control with them  --  the very thing the school was founded to do . <p> " Best Practice is supposed to be a flagship , and under her , it is sinking , " said Mike Meyers , chair of the Social Studies Department at the school , 2040 W. Adams . It is one of the city 's first " small schools , " with 389 students . CPS has 37 small schools . <p> " I think we have a situation where we have a school leader who does not believe in the official mission of this school , " said National-Louis University Professor Harvey Daniels , a school founder . " It breaks my heart to see this terrible mismatch of philosophies acting itself out to the detriment of students . " <p> It was a different story in 1988 , when the Citizens School Committee named Dandridge-Alexander Principal of the Year for taking over Spencer Elementary School , 214 N. Lavergne , in 1985 and raising reading and math scores from the bottom 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , " she has created a chaotic , depressing environment , and extremely low morale , " said science teacher Arthur Griffin , among the original staff when it opened as a small-schools model in 1996 on a quiet boulevard in the gentrifying Near West Side , not far from the United Center . <p> The idea of the school was to be a model of cooperation . Teachers would know every student 's name . They would shape policy . <p> Her critics admit Dandridge-Alexander had the sterling credentials to take on the job and say she talked a good game before the local school council gave her a four-year contract last year at a salary of $99,300 . She also oversees Foundations Elementary and Nia Middle School housed in the fortresslike yellow brick building that once was Cregier High . She is the only CPS principal in charge of three schools . <p> Council members now say she immediately switched to a traditional format , where the principal makes all decisions . <p> " I 'm aware of this , " Dandridge-Alexander said . " They talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure what they mean by that when whatever it is that you 're doing is causing the students to achieve less . Our students are simply not achieving at those higher rates that this school purports to be able to accomplish . " <p> Her supporters at Best Practice blame its problems on its format . It was n't working when she arrived , they say . <p> " Best Practice ? The practices do n't work . Next year , we will be on academic probation , " said counselor Angela Cunningham . " Ms. Alexander has done nothing to these teachers but require they do their job . Change is a problem . They do n't want to accept it . " <p> The principal 's budget practices also are a sore subject . <p> Discrepancies at Foundations led the LSC to request an audit in February after there was not enough money to pay for ISAT test study booklets . It showed the principal overdrew an account by $8,010 . <p> " This was for two security people . What happened was not enough money was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ran over , " said Dandridge-Alexander . " The LSC chair asked me to close the budget , which I did . " <p> " That 's when parents became angry and picketed her , " said Foundations LSC chair Beverly Gillon . <p> On a cold March Monday morning , parents from Foundations showed up carrying signs and chanting , demanding answers . The school had 174 students in August . There are now 136 . <p> In another fiscal snafu , a misplaced $60,000 grant check made out to Best Practice on Sept. 20 , 2003 , also had to be stopped and reissued by the Bill &; Melinda Gates Foundation . <p> " I kept asking her about the check . I finally called the foundation . It was never deposited . We were supposed to use that money for professional development activities throughout the year , " said Mark Fertel , lead teacher at Best Practice . <p> " The check was reissued to National-Louis University ... on April 20 , 2004 , " said Ernestine Key , program associate at the Chicago High School Redesign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to small schools here . <p> " A check comes , I 'm going to deposit it , " said Dandridge-Alexander . " I 'm told at the board that grant checks are n't just deposited . There 's a process . ... In March , I 'm finally told the process had been finalized . I 've still got the first check . It 's still here . " <p> Parents say the bottom line is students are suffering . <p> Some complain their special education students do n't get services required by law . " My 11-year-old was assessed eligible for special ed last May . But when I kept asking my baby ' What are they doing for you ? ' She said ' Nothing , Mama . They doing nothing , ' " said Patricia Johnson , parent of a Foundations fifth-grader . <p> In March , when a boy threatened to kill another boy with a letter opener and received only a 10-day suspension , teachers were scared . <p> Dandridge-Alexander " said the boy was just showing ' bravado ' and refused to expel him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union rep last week , and she finally agreed " to move toward expulsion , said teacher Matt Feldman . <p> The state of affairs is a disappointment to National-Louis University professors who founded the school and are advisers . <p> " We believed in shared decision making . She dismantled that . We believe in integrated instruction . She took that away . We believe in professional development opportunities for teachers . She disallowed that , " charged National-Louis Professor Marilyn Bizar . " I believe that she has to leave . She 's obviously not the right fit . " <p> " We have to do things differently . Change is very hard , but it has to happen , because the kids ' needs just are n't being met , " responded Dandridge-Alexander . " No matter what you say about philosophy , the bottom line is this : The principal is going to take the hit ultimately for what happens to the kids , so you have to take a hard look at the structure and philosophy here and ask the hard questions . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does this benefit kids ' learning ? ' And there 's a reluctance on the part of some who have been here a while to actually sit down and address that , " Dandridge-Alexander said . <p> Letters from parents and teachers have flooded the board all year . Only last week did officials step in to demand Dandridge-Alexander initiate a corrective action plan . <p> " Have we heard of difficulties since the school year began ? Yes . Are corrective measures being taken ? Yes , " said Jeanne Nowaczewski , director of the Chicago Public Schools ' Office of Small Schools . She said she was n't at liberty to be more specific . <p> And while a battle rages at Best Practice and Foundations , Nia and its 116 students seem to stay out of the fray . <p> " We do know the problems here , " said lead teacher Jacqueline Sanders . " We just got an award for our scores going up again , and I 'm attributing that to the diligence of the teachers that we have . It does n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the school point out that low test scores at Best Practice preceded her . <p> Last school year , only 15.6 percent of its students hit grade level on state tests , just enough to avoid the probation mark of 15 percent . Foundations and Nia are at risk this school year under new higher standards . <p> " There 's this thing about Best Practice being this really high learning place , and it 's not . It 's a mess over there . They need to sit down , fight it out , and come up with solutions , " said Mark Payne , a community member on the LSCs of all three schools . <p> Music teacher Lawrence Robinson says , " Teachers are trying to hold on to the concept of ' teacher-led ' school . Being teacher-led does not , however , give teachers the authority to circumvent the authority of a principal to make final decisions . " <p> Said Dandridge-Alexander : " There are communication problems . One of the first things we need to do is establish a structure to clarify how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluation was from some teachers at Best Practice . I am principal of two other schools . This is a unique position , being principal of a building over three schools . " <p> All agree it 's a tough job . <p> " The Dyanne I knew , her credentials were stellar . But whether or not she was the best match for the teachers and for that particular situation , or whether anybody can really do a stellar job in being principal of three schools at one time , is the question , " said Michael Klonsky , director of the nonprofit Small Schools Workshop . <p> Chicago Teachers Union ' Principals Report Card ' <p> In the survey , 49 percent of respondents gave their principals an A ( 4 points ) or a B ( 3 points ) ; 17 percent a C ( 2 points ) , and 34 percent a D ( 1 point ) or an F ( 0 ) . Thirty-four percent of the union 's 33,000 teachers and paraprofessionals at 546 schools responded to the survey taken in March . <p> Schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seward 3.86 <p> Decatur 3.75 <p> Dever 3.69 <p> Canty 3.67 <p> Franklin 3.67 <p> Byrne 3.64 <p> Holden 3.63 <p> Leland 3.50 <p> Schools with lowest-rated principals <p> Best Practice 0.00 <p> Wright 0.33 <p> Mt .
