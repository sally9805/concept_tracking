A lightweight , full-suspension bruiser built for cross-country epics // TELL YOUR FRIENDS THIS BIKE ... is n't built by a bunch of wussies . The guys at Kona have Vancouver 's North Shore  --  some of the most technical terrain in the world-as their back yard . They build insanely durable bikes , able to withstand sickening mud , torrential rain and violent drops . No , the Mokomoko ca n't handle radical freeride abuse , but it certainly can hold its own against the pounding of the Pacific Northwest . Next rainy day you 're lounging about the family room and your buddy slips in one of those off-the-wall freeride tapes , let them know the majority of bikes ridden in these flicks are Konas  --  and for good reason . The worst conditions spur the best bikes . But do n't confuse this for a flyweight cross-country racer or ride-off-the-roof freeride bike-the hearty 4 inches of rear travel strike the perfect balance between excess and scarcity . Make sure your friends notice the asymmetric chainstays that increase rear-end rigidity while minimizing chainline or mud interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SDG Satellite SL saddle . Boast about the super-stiff LX Hollowtech crankset . All these cleverly calculated details are thought out by a bunch of insightful madmen who ride the tar out of what they sell , and would rather quit than produce a " wimpy " bike . The Mokomoko might be a lighter version of what Kona regularly sells , but it 's still a beast . $1,799 BUY IT IF You want a lighterweight bike for cross  --  country adventures . FORGET IT IF You plan to race competitively or ride extremely aggressive terrain . 7 WORDS ABOUT THIS BIKE Cross-country . Dieting freerider Laterally stiff . Madman-approved . Tough BEST THING ABOUT THIS BIKE : The smart balance of weight and durability , which makes it perfect for the long-day off  --  road adventure of climbing mixed with some light-duty freeriding . The stout , asymmetric rear swingarm keeps the rear wheel tracking vertically with only a hint of the lateral play associated with flyweight designs . Easton 's Ultralite front triangle shaves grams without sacrificing strength or stiffness . WORST THING : The rear suspension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice the difference with the stock linear-pull brakes , because the canti studs are on the seatstay linkage . But if you upgrade to disc brakes you could experience a reduction in suspension quality . When the disc tab is on the chainstay , as it is on this bike , the swingarm is subject to a touch of brake  --  jacking , compromising suspension . BRAGGING RIGHTS : The small stuff 's often compromised on $2,000 bikes , so it 's a treat to see quality items . such as the Koski stem , Interloc Quad seatpost and Kona handlebar . ALMOST PERFECT : While true Four-Bar suspension produces a slightly more independent and active ride , this modified version provides a great balance between price , weight and performance . True Four-Bar places the rear pivot point on the chainstay ( which is allowed to officially be called a " Horst Link " ) . Modified Four-Bar places the pivot on the seatstay . While true Four Bar optimizes rear wheel activity ( over bumps ) yet remains independent from pedaling and braking forces , modified Four Bar sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
