One <p> If he had to die today , he 'd have preferred a warm climate and a bullet between the eyes over this . <p> Carlos Delgado had no one to blame but himself . He had agreed to take the lead on this screwed-up mission . <p> The routine HAHO  --  high altitude , high opening  --  jump from a CG ? ? 130 came with a standard set of risks . First , his team had to hit a tiny spot in the French Alps near St. Gervais . Second , a midnight op upped the ante . Last , parachuting into a snowstorm kicked in the high-octane factor . <p> And those were n't even the best reasons for labeling this op suicidal . <p> He stretched his legs and lifted a hand to scratch his face , but stopped . The Gentex face mask itched like a son of a bitch , but breaking the seal between skin and mask would immediately lower the raised nitrogen level in his blood . That meant he 'd have to abort the jump and scrub the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of operatives . <p> With the mood his three teammates had been in when they went wheels up , someone would immediately accommodate his wish for a quick death . <p> But they 'd show some restraint since none of them wanted to waste a day off for his funeral . <p> Carlos checked his watch . Just after lunch on Sunday in the States . Headquarters should have new intel by now . He was ready to get moving as much as he hated making the jump . <p> He 'd made the leap more times than he wanted to remember , but the stakes were high this time . The only thing worse than flying in an airplane was exiting one during flight ... and at this altitude . An adrenaline junkie 's dream . Not his . <p> He slapped a sideways look at Korbin Maximus , sitting next to him on another uncomfortable canvas seat . Their resident adrenaline junkie and insertion specialist for BAD  --  Bureau of American Defense  --  wore an identical oxygen mask . His night-vision goggles were shoved up on his forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and arms casually crossed , Korbin appeared at rest , but Carlos knew their point man was not asleep . <p> " What 's the matter , Korbin ? Job puttin ' you to sleep ? " Reagan " Rae " Graham 's British lilt came through the commo headset they all wore . Perched across from Carlos and Korbin , Rae was the only female on this op and no petite miss at five-eight . She could more than handle herself in hand-to-hand combat , cool as an ice cube under pressure . Few men would suspect the trim woman packaged with all those lush curves to be so lethal , but she was one tough babe from the short , sandy brown hair to a mile of legs ... to the G36C rifle strapped across her chesty flight suit . <p> " Just reserving my strength for later . " Korbin lifted a dark lash long enough to send a whispered wink at Rae . <p> " For the op or some sweet thang ? " Rae chided in a poor imitation of his Texas drawl that sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm always up for a sweet thing , especially one loaded for bear . " Korbin 's eyes crinkled in challenge . <p> " Yeah , right . In your dreams . " Rae flipped a droll don't-waste-your-time glance at him . <p> Carlos rolled his eyes at the pair . The banter and verbal poking had gone on for the past six months . Why had n't they found a room yet ? Should be a perfect match since both of them considered dinner reservations a long-term commitment . <p> BAD did have a " No fraternizing with team members " rule , which would n't normally faze most agency operatives , who considered breaking rules part of their job description . <p> But the first commitment of every agent in BAD was to protect teammates , which would be damn hard to do if one of the agents caught in cross fire was a loved one . <p> Carlos had no problem steering clear of relationships with females on a mission . Emotions complicated an op and jeopardized lives . <p> He 'd learned that lesson the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Besides , Korbin , you have n't made it to the R 's yet , " Rae piped up . " Who is it this week ? Jasmine , Kelly , or Lisa ? " <p> Korbin scowled , eyelids still at half-mast . <p> Rae 's gaze twinkled with undisguised gloating over the direct hit . <p> " Is that what you 're doing ? " Gotthard Heinrich , the fourth operative , broke in . As the beefiest member of the team , he packed an easy 275-plus of solid muscle into that granite body and a temper not to be tested . " Gayle two weeks ago ... " Above the clear oxygen mask , Gotthard 's diamond-blue eyes narrowed in sharp concentration . " Haley last week ... Isabelle ... two days ago . Damn ! You are working your way through da alphabet . You son-a-bitch . " He spoke perfect English , French , German , Russian , and Italian whenever he wanted , a faint German accent slipping into his English only when in a secure situation . <p> " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Hey . You 're the one with the itch and a predilection for patterns . " <p> " Must be nice to be single , " Gotthard grumbled . <p> " Depends . " Korbin shifted his slouch . " I do n't have someone to go home to every night . " <p> " Makes two of us . " Gotthard dropped his head back , eyes shut . <p> Banter eased tension on a mission , but Carlos grimaced over Gotthard 's slip . The few agents aware of the big guy 's turbulent marriage also knew Gotthard did not discuss it openly . <p> BAD was a covert organization the U.S. government would never acknowledge that protected national security and saved lives , to put it in pretty terms , but the bottom line was they did whatever it took to get the job done . That way of life generally torpedoed serious commitments , in spite of a few couples that had managed to make cohabitating look possible . Most of the time even the best relationships fell victim as unavoidable casualties . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and getting an earful from his wife about being home for Thanksgiving in four weeks . <p> Would n't be so hard if Gotthard could tell his wife the real reason he 'd missed the last two holidays . That he did n't really design interiors for aircrafts , but that sufficed as a cover . <p> Gotthard sat up , tense lines daggering the bridge of his nose . <p> " Incoming ? " Carlos asked before he could stop himself , but he needed better intel , now . Gotthard had the only link to headquarters and had probably just gotten a vibration from his wrist unit . <p> The big guy gave a curt nod as he shoved the pale gray sleeve of his flight suit back , exposing his wrist video . The satellite-linked video device looked like an oversize square watch similar to the VG ? ? Rambo unit worn by Israeli soldiers and alerted the wearer of an incoming message by vibrating . <p> But this electronic baby had been customized and developed just for BAD operations , all financed by a silent investor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no sense of humor when it came to his name , and a background most agents only speculated about in hushed conversations , no one questioned the director 's supplier for BAD toys . <p> Gotthard was their communication specialist , who could all but talk to NASA with a piece of aluminum foil and tin can if they needed to reach an astronaut . When the wide-bodied agent finished reading the text on his arm piece , he lifted his gaze to Carlos , then his deep baritone came through the commo set . <p> " Heads up , everyone . " Perfect English this time . <p> Korbin straightened next to Carlos , alert and ready . Rae cut her eyes at Gotthard , who continued once he had everyone 's attention . <p> " New information is coming through in chunks . The transmissions are breaking up as we move between two satellites . " Gotthard 's gaze shot down to his wrist video . " Package ... is confirmed missing from origin ... stolen goods . " <p> Carlos nodded when Gotthard glanced up to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the missing seventeen-year-old daughter of an American diplomat currently in Uruguay working on a military-site agreement the United States needed in that region . The diplomat thought his daughter was still traveling across South America with friends , but she was also known as a hellion who had disappeared from time to time from her private school in Europe . <p> BAD intercepted a kidnapping tip from an anonymous source known only as Mirage . The message indicating Mandy as a target of kidnappers had been sent with specific electronic markers , obviously meant for international intelligence agencies scanning for suspicious communication . BAD instituted a covert search across South America , which ended at the last place Mandy had been seen . Another electronic tip followed hours later , warning if the young girl went missing to look for her at a chGteau in the St. Gervais area of the French Alps . <p> The BAD mission room had sounded more like a bar brawl in the making twelve hours ago when Joe first informed them of this jump . Carlos could n't fault his companions for arguing against sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renegade daughter had disappeared twice before then shown up later as if nothing were wrong . But the minute Joe shared that the second intercepted missive from Mirage stated Mandy would be given to something called a fratelli , the room had quieted , all agents ready to go . <p> Added to that , Mirage had been correct too many times to ignore the validity of the message . The very reason every intelligence agency in the world searched for this unknown person . No informant ever just shared intelligence freely . <p> They all had an agenda . <p> BAD needed to find out what Mirage stood to gain from sharing this information . What game was going on ? <p> The team knew all too well that the reference to a fratelli in the tip could well mean the Fratelli de il Sovrano , which translated into Sovereign Brotherhood , number one on BAD 's most-wanted list of dangerous organizations . <p> During the past year every agent had seen what this maniacal group could do to human beings . Men , women , and children had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks . The virus unleashed had turned the victims ' bodies into hideous forms as they drew their last breaths pleading for death . <p> Making tonight 's HAHO jump was no longer under debate with the chance of saving this young woman from the Fratelli , plus the obvious bonus of finding a link to this organization of monsters . <p> But no one had located Mandy in South America so the second , and possibly only , shot they had at rescuing her was tonight . <p> Carlos ran over every step in his mind , again , looking for anything he might have missed . He 'd spent the past five days coordinating this op from BAD 's headquarters in Nashville , dispatching agents to investigate possible chGteaus in St. Gervais based on occupancy and activity . The ground teams had quickly narrowed the choices to six and kept each site under surveillance , watching for unusual movement . <p> He received word twelve hours ago of four snowmobiles and a Range Rover arriving at one chGteau now protected with armed guards . Bingo . <p> Thirty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mission felt rushed and unplanned , but that 's what dropped it squarely in the hands of BAD . They could  --  and would  --  move on a hunch when other agencies had to go through proper channels . <p> " There 's more coming through , " Gotthard said , his eyes locked on the small monitor . " Another notice received ... this one identifying courier ... " <p> Courier was code for the identity of the kidnappers suspected of delivering Mandy to the Fratelli . <p> " Have they found the messenger ? " Carlos asked , indicating the identity or location of the mysterious informant Mirage . <p> " Not yet , " Gotthard replied without looking up as he scratched on his notepad . <p> If misinformation from this Mirage character sent his team into an ambush or put Mandy at risk , Carlos would be looking for blood when he returned . <p> If they returned . <p> Gotthard hit a button on his wrist unit , ending the connection . " Here 's the courier . " He lifted the paper he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Anguis . <p> Rae 's lips moved silently mouthing ahn-gee as she absorbed the information . <p> Carlos blinked . He stared at the letters , trying to make them mean something else , but there was no mistaking Anguis . Not the largest organized-crime family in South America , but one of the most dangerous to cross . Merde ! If the tip was correct and the men guarding the chGteau worked for Durand Anguis , they might recognize Carlos . And if they did ... <p> " Pilot just radioed a ten-minute warning , " Gotthard announced . <p> Everyone went into motion , forcing Carlos from his shock . Could the Anguis really be involved with the Fratelli ? This smelled like a setup , but who would know to set him up ? He switched his 02 tube from the console to the bottle attached to his jumpsuit and accepted the busted hand he 'd been dealt , then focused on his role as team leader . " Sound off . " <p> After making the same oxygen-supply switch , Korbin nodded . " Check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Synchronize altimeters . " Carlos gave his reading and finished with " Six minutes . " <p> The next check would be two minutes , then showtime with no second takes . <p> Carlos adjusted his goggles and strapped on his helmet . " Korbin is on point , me , then Rae . Gotthard sweeps cleanup . " <p> Irritation fumed in Rae 's gaze . <p> Carlos did n't care what she thought of him putting her in the crib position , the safest slot in an assault . <p> One woman had died in his arms years ago . <p> He would n't be responsible for another . <p> Highly skilled and lethal as any man on this team , Rae was more than capable of protecting herself . A damned good agent . But Carlos had seen too many women die in inhuman ways , one grotesque example only three months ago . A female informant had missed a meeting then disappeared , until Carlos discovered her inside a building in a remote mountain range in Brazil where rebels hid a stash of weapons . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skirmish with the government over a week before Carlos and a team located the building . <p> Carlos could still smell the baked stench of rotting bodies . He found the weapons and the informant along with seven more women in chain-link cages waiting to be sold . The metal building had turned into an inferno when the temperatures roared over a hundred degrees every day . One nineteen-year-old female 's fingers clung to the chain-link where she reached for help . <p> Nightmares were the vanguard of his conscience and every decision he made . <p> Carlos shook off the morbid vision and focused on the living . " Two minutes . " Time to head for the rear . <p> Korbin moved forward , careful not to tangle his feet in the loose hoses . Everyone filed in line behind Korbin toward the rear of the cavernous fuselage , the silence now filled only with the roar of the jet engines . The aircraft 's transponder pinged a signal to local air traffic control that this was a commercial flight delivering cargo . <p> The ping just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo . <p> Carlos forced a long , easy breath through his lungs . Anything to slow the blood slamming through his veins from the shock . Anguis soldiers could be waiting at the chGteau . One had seen , and recognized , him in the past sixteen years . That man had n't lived to tell anyone . <p> Because of that incident three years ago , surgical alteration had been necessary . Durand 's massive soldier nicknamed El Toro , the bull , had recognized Carlos during an undercover operation in Argentina before Carlos saw him . The six-foot-seven Anguis soldier had once taught him how to hit a baseball as a teen , but when he encountered Carlos in the undercover operation , all El Toro saw was the half-million bounty Durand offered to deliver him alive . The Anguis soldier planned a perfect ambush with an additional man . Jumped on his way to meet Gotthard , Carlos refused to go down without spilling blood , most of which was his . But he 'd managed to send a double-click radio signal to Gotthard for backup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found Carlos beaten close to death , his face hamburger . <p> Agents were at their most vulnerable while undercover , which influenced Joe 's orders for the plastic surgeon to create a new look to protect his man in the future . <p> The face that stared back at Carlos from a mirror was at times similar and other times startling . Different enough no one would easily recognize him and put his team at risk , his only true concern . BAD operatives were some of the most highly skilled , and dangerous , in the world . He 'd stake his life on them , and had many times . <p> He could n't ask for a better team tonight . <p> But Durand Anguis operated like no other criminal entity , using the most unexpected tactics . <p> The rear load ramp groaned open . Icy air blasted in as a precursor of what to expect . When Korbin moved forward , so did the team . A bottomless black void loomed beyond the gaping hole to suck them from the aircraft . Carlos shifted closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a low-hanging blanket of clouds dumping fresh snow across the French Alps . <p> Folding each finger into his gloved hand as he silently counted down , Korbin closed his fist at five  --  the signal to go . <p> Carlos followed suit , a buffeting **25;258;TOOLONG wind jarring him . Legs tucked in a sitting position , he yanked the rip cord , deploying his ram-air parachute . When the square canopy caught , the sudden change of airspeed wrenched his body backward and up . Jaw clenched to keep his teeth from banging together , he lifted his hands and grasped the risers , instinctively maneuvering the parachute . <p> His heart drummed faster than a machine gun with the trigger pinned . Adrenaline exploded through him , then he drew a deep breath and settled in for the ride . To be honest , he did enjoy this one part of jumping , loved the sudden quiet and sense of floating in ethereal peace . Seconds evaporated faster than the moisture on his goggles as the team glided twenty kilometers toward the landing spot . He lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching over his shoulder for the past sixteen years , waiting to be killed . <p> If things went to shit tonight , the wait could be over . <p> He squinted . Two tiny lights appeared in the greenish view of his night-vision goggles as Gotthard 's wide shape and Rae 's long form came into focus . Where was Korbin ? <p> A flicker of light dropped diagonally across his path at last . The adrenaline junkie settled into the front spot . All lights were extinguished , radio silence in force . <p> Alex Sanderson , the fifth operative , known as Sandman for putting the enemy to sleep , was an ex-Air Force combat controller , otherwise known as an assault weatherman , highly trained . Sandman would be in place by now setting the infrared strobe as a beacon for the landing spot . He 'd been on the ground two klicks from the target for the past week camping in a spider hide , invisible to everyone while performing reconnaissance vital to the mission . <p> If Sandman was not where they expected him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korbin banked left and Carlos followed . Still no strobe , but trust ran deep in this team . Each agent would continue toward the objective with the absolute knowledge the others performed their part of the mission without fault . <p> Carlos squinted as they broke through the wall of white and closed in on the undetectable patch of earth . <p> A pulsing strobe came into view . Thank you , Sandman . <p> In the last thousand-foot drop to the mountainside , a ferocious wind gusted up from the canyon below . Carlos hit and rolled through two feet of snow . He released the chute that was dragging him and planted his feet . When he swiveled around , searching for the team , Gotthard was already standing and consulting his wrist video . Korbin was plowing his way toward Rae , who lay sprawled backward on the snow . <p> Carlos started toward her . A sick thought that her body might have hit a boulder in the snow flashed into his mind . But by the time Korbin reached her , Rae sat up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to help in any form . <p> She and Korbin reached Carlos as Sandman strode up to the team , weapon hanging across his chest . Sandman raised a gloved hand Rae slapped for their usual high-five " hello . " Inside the dark mahogany skin beneath his dove-gray snow camouflage suit was a man Carlos always wanted on his side . <p> Sandman had two personalities . One could turn a female into his angel for the night in a blink , and the other could make a terrorist piss himself . <p> Once all the chutes were stowed out of sight , Korbin waited for the thumbs-up " all-set " sign from everyone , then struck out , leading the hike . A hundred meters from the three-level home , Carlos signaled to gather . The team closed quarters behind a mound of naked boulders . <p> Gotthard produced a compact thermal infrared camera and raised it to his face . He began passing information through hand signs : Two guards outside , walking  --  one on the east side , one on the west . Four bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third floor , one was horizontal and motionless  --  probably the female hostage . <p> Carlos signaled each operative to move into position . He 'd rescue the young woman and protect his team first . Saving his own ass came last ... if luck shined on him one more time . <p> He steeled himself and moved forward , ready to find out if the men guarding this chGteau really belonged to Durand Anguis.Copyright 2009 by Sherrilyn Kenyon and Dianna Love <br> Continues ...
