Ziggy looked up at the night sky in amazement . The weather had been clear and cold , and thousands of stars decorated the inky blackness of the night . " Awesome , mon , " Ziggy whispered to his friend Rico , who stood shivering beside him . " They look like shiny pieces of hard candy floating up there , do n't they ? " Rico stamped his feet and blew into his gloves . Even though he had on new , fur-lined boots and a down jacket , he felt chilled . " It 's cold out here , Ziggy . Let 's go look at the stars from inside your house . " Ziggy stretched both his bare hands up to the sky . He wore no gloves , but he rarely took off his favorite hat , a fuzzy black , green , and yellow cap his mother had knit for him . " I feel like I could almost reach up there and pull a star out of the sky and bite it , " Ziggy said with a laugh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chocolate Popsicle ! " The two friends hurried into the warmth of the house , where Ziggy 's mom had mugs of hot chocolate waiting for them . " Thanks , Mrs. Colwin , " Rico said as he sipped the warm drink . He was glad they were n't having a meeting of their club , the Black Dinosaurs , in their backyard clubhouse tonight . Ziggy , even though he had been born in the tropical climate of Jamaica , seemed to love the winter weather of Cincinnati , Ohio . Hehad wanted to meet as they had done all summer , but the chilly winter winds had chased the boys inside . The doorbell rang , and Ziggy jumped up to answer it . " What 's up , dudes ? " Ziggy said in greeting to the other two members of the club , Rashawn and Jerome . " You want some hot chocolate ? " Rashawn , tall , thin , and always ready to go one-on-one at the basketball court , walked in wearing his favorite army boots and jacket . Jerome , shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather jacket , and grabbed a mug of hot chocolate in each hand . " It 's really cold out there ! " Jerome exclaimed as he sipped first from one mug , then the other . " How you figure you get two cups of cocoa ? " Rashawn asked . " I 'm tougher than the rest of you , so I need double the fuel ! " he replied with a grin . Rashawn took the last mug of chocolate , impressed that Ziggy 's mom had known to make extra , and sipped it gratefully . " I just want to make sure I do n't get the cup with the pickle in it ! " He glanced at Ziggy , who , as usual , was stirring his chocolate with a thick green pickle . " Why do you do that , man ? " Rico asked , shaking his head . " The pickle makes it taste better , mon . Besides , we were out of ketchup ! " The other boys groaned , but they were used to Ziggy 's strange food habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade . " Did you bring your Space Camp stuff ? " Rashawn asked the other boys . " It 's right here in my backpack , " Rico answered , pulling out a folder of forms and instructions . " This is going to be so cool ! " Jerome and Ziggy pulled out their paperwork as well . " I ca n't wait to get to Space Camp , mon , " Ziggy exclaimed as he sucked the chocolate off the pickle . " Would n't it be awesome to go into space for real ? " " Yeah , " Jerome said . " I wonder what you have to do to be an astronaut . " " I never thought about it , " Rashawn said . " But I suppose there 's lots of training . " " You got ta learn how to read the instruments and fly the space shuttle , " Rico offered . " And know what to do if you have to walk in space and fix something on the outside of the shuttle . " " I figure you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't throw up , mon ! " Ziggy added . " When we get to Space Camp , you practice that one by yourself  --  okay , Ziggy ? " Jerome laughed , held his nose , and moved to a chair away from Ziggy . " Let 's go over this stuff , so the Black Dinosaurs Space Team is ready , " Rico said . " I ca n't believe my dad is taking us all the way to Huntsville , Alabama , for the weekend . I hope it 's warmer there than it is here in Ohio ! " " Your dad is the bomb , mon , " Ziggy exclaimed . " I know you only see him on vacations and stuff , but that is so cool that he 's a pilot in the air force . " " Yeah , my dad really is all right , " Rico replied . " He took me up in a jet last year on my birthday . " " Awesome ! " Jerome said . " Did you throw up ? " Ziggy asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangest things , Ziggy . " Rico shook his head . " How long will it take to get there ? " Rashawn asked . " My dad says about seven hours by car . We go from Cincinnati , through Louisville , Kentucky , and Nashville , Tennessee , all the way down to Huntsville . But that 's not counting stops at fast-food places or to see cool stuff , " Rico told him . " You think we can find our hometown chili dogs in Alabama ? " Jerome asked . " Cincinnati makes the best chili in the world . " " You know , every city thinks its chili is the best , " Rico replied with a grin . " It 's even better if you put jelly on your chili dogs , mon , " Ziggy said cheerfully . " Gives them that extra-sweet flavor ! " " Yuck ! " Jerome , Rashawn , and Rico all threw sofa pillows at Ziggy , who dodged them easily . " So , what do we take with us besides bug spray ? " Jerome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rico was handing each of them . " There are no bugs in space , mon ! " Ziggy said with authority , holding two of the sofa pillows on his lap . " Yeah , but I bet there are plenty in Huntsville ! " Jerome replied . " I take no chances , my man ! " " Let 's see , " Rico said , reading from the top page of the instructions . " Toothbrush and stuff , pajamas , socks , deodorant ... " " Do n't forget that ! " Rashawn said with a laugh . " It also says not to bring portable music players or handheld video games , " Rico continued . " Not even my Mega Mighty Martian Blasters game ? " Ziggy asked with dismay . " How will we practice dealing with invading Martian spacemen without that game ? " " Maybe we 'll get real information instead of pretend video-game stuff , " Rico replied sensibly . " You mean it 's not real ? There are n't any Martians out there ready to attack Earth , mon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , making zapping sounds like a space weapon . " Probably not , Ziggy , " Jerome told him . " But maybe you can ask somebody about it when we get there . " " If there 's even just a possibility that Martian invaders might be real , I want to be ready , just in case . Martians are purple , have three heads , and spit fire , you know , unless they 're in disguise . They can make themselves look like anything they want  --  a cat , a dog , even an Earthling . " " How do you know this ? " Rashawn asked him . Ziggy looked at him with surprise . " Because I 've played the game a million times , mon ! " Rico laughed . " What else did you learn from that game , Ziggy ? " " Martians live in trees and eat rocks , mostly . But they have a special fondness for chocolate-covered pickles , just like I do , so they ca n't be all bad ! " " I bet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jerome told Ziggy . " Well , I 'll be sure to tell them ! I guess the future of the planet is going to depend on me , mon , " Ziggy said . " I ca n't wait to get to Space Camp ! " Continues ...
