We hear C &amp; C Music Factory 's " Things That Make You Go Hmmm " as lights come up on DYLAN chasing NORRIN around the couch , fighting over the TV remote . MEMPHIS , CHAVEZ , &amp; PRINCE watch and move to the music . The music plays until DYLAN catches up to NORRIN . O'CONNER-DIAZ Leave that one on ! RADD No way ! You got ta be kidding ! That 's the lamest show this side of the Pecos  --  O'CONNER-DIAZ Leave it , I said ! And where the heck are the Pecos anyway ? RADD See what I mean ? ! Mind pollution , Dylan  --  one 's sense of geography is always the first to go . That 's what TV does for poor simple people like you ! O'CONNER-DIAZ Simple ? ! You take that back . RADD Why ? It 's the truth . You know how many people in the U.S. ca n't locate China on a world map ? Duh ! It 's only like the biggest thing there ! And some people do n't know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! It 's spooky , I tell you ! Do n't you think that 's spooky ? ( DYLAN stops chasing him and just glares at him holding out her hand . HE puts the remote into it . ) Okay , okay . I 'm sorry . But this show is so dumb  --  p. 3 O'CONNER-DIAZ ( Grabbing NORRIN by the collar and sitting him down next to her on the couch , then turning up the volume on the remote . ) Sssshhh ! ! ( The sounds of the TV voices come up loudly . ) TV VOICE OF SHAH-REE Dag , Nice-Ice ! I'm'a ' gon na git mah homeys tah cut you up ! TV VOICE OF NICE-ICE Shoot ! You ai n't gon na git nobodys to do jack , ' cause you ai n't got no dang friends ! And you ugly ! You uglier than the backside of " Babe " . You jus'a pig butt to me !

TV VOICE OF SHAH-REE You jus'speechalizing that I 'm " bad "  --  but that 's good where I come from ! TV VOICE OF A POLICEMAN Put down that box cutter and join the world , Shah-ree ! O'CONNER-DIAZ A box cutter  --  wow ! I 'd do anything for one of those . RADD Are you nuts ? ! Those things really cut people , Dylan  --  so they really bleed . O'CONNER-DIAZ Sssshhh ! ! TV VOICE OF SHAH-REE A real warrior never lets go of her blade . Shah-ree means war . p. 4 TV VOICE OF A POLICEMAN No it does n't . It does n't mean anything . You just made it up to cover your real name . Was Sharon too nice a name for the tough animal you became ? Sharon means " garden of plenty " , but you 're just plenty of nothing , Miss Sharon-Shahree . TV VOICE OF NICE-ICE Shoot ! He called you out , " Sharon " . Shade , snag , rank , and gotyas ! TV VOICE OF POLICEMAN And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world Norberto ? Your mother musta cried when you changed it . TV VOICE OF NICE-ICE Don'be talkin'bout my mama now ! ( The sounds of a screaming fight from the television . NORRIN turns it off . The ANIMALS watch NORRIN &amp; DYLAN argue like it 's a tennis match . ) RADD Shut up ! That show is too loud and too stupid . O'CONNER-DIAZ Shah-reeShahreethat 's a beautiful namesoAfricanShah-ree RADD You 're losing it , Dylan . That 's not a person 's name . It sounds like a shampoo or something . " Use Shah-ree with the built-in conditionerand your hair will never smell the same . " O'CONNER-DIAZ I only use Nubian Essence on my hair . RADD And you know what 's in that ? The same thing as plain old baby shampoo cept they charge you more for the fake name which lures the unsuspecting young black woman  --  like yourself  --  to an unreasonable purchase . p. 5 O'CONNER-DIAZ How would you know ? You 're too cheap to buy anything of high quality . RADD I do n't need to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O'CONNER-DIAZ What 's that supposed to mean ? ! RADD You know what I mean . ( Seeing that DYLAN is hurt by his remark ) I 'm sorry . But I ca n't stand how you 're acting lately . Boesha is so stupid , Dylan . You should n't listen to what she says  --  O'CONNER-DIAZ Shut up ! What do you know ? ! RADD I mean it 's so dorky what she called you  --  I mean an oatmeal creme cookie ? Come on what 's that supposed  --  O'CONNER-DIAZ I thought you were my friend , Ferdie . RADD I am , but  --  O'CONNER-DIAZ If you were really my friend , you would n't repeat that to me . RADD I defended you from her , did n't I ? O'CONNER-DIAZ I do n't need your help . You do n't begin to understand nothing about me . RADD I do n't care how many colors you are , you 're  --  p. 6 O'CONNER-DIAZ You do n't care , because you know what you are . Why do n't you go home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  O'CONNER-DIAZ I said , " Go home . " RADD Forget you then ! ( HE begins to exit . ) As Nice-Ice would say , " I 's jettin .

We got ta go over that quadratic equation thing before fifth period . O'CONNER-DIAZ No , we do n't . RADD Yeah , we do , or you 're failing for sure . O'CONNER-DIAZ Equations have no meaningalso , Algebra has no meaningand especially , Math tests have no meaning . RADD Maybe it 's you has no meaning , Dylan . O'CONNER-DIAZ Another shooting backhand statement ! What 's that supposed to mean ? RADD First geography , then it 's all power of comprehension ! I suppose you do n't know what that means either ! I 'm outta here . ( NORRIN exits. ) p. 7 O'CONNER-DIAZ What did he mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate not knowing what people mean . ( Pause ) That Shah-ree sure was all that  --  and then some . ( Moves to a full-length mirror and looks at herself ; in SHAH-REE 's voice . ) She looked kinda like me tooI could be her sister . But she 's stronger than me . Look at everything she 's been through  --  grew up in a welfare hotel with five brothers and sisters who all picked on her until she rised up one day and fought back . And she has to keep doing it because she 's alone in the world . ( Pause ) I wish I was alone sometimes . Like an orphan . Nobody to bother me and make me go to school and watch me all the time . I love my parents , but they just get on my last nerve sometimes . But sistah Shah-ree do n't have any a dem problems , do she ? Uh uhn !

CHAVEZ sings along and then MEMPHIS does a perfect dance to it . ( The lyrics to Prince 's " Gold " : " there 's a mountain and it 's mighty high u can not see the top unless u fly there 's a molehill of proven ground there ai n't nowhere 2 go if u hang around everybody wants 2 sell what 's already been sold everybody wants 2 tell what 's already been told what 's the use of money if u ai n't gon na break the mold even at the center of the fire there is cold and all that glitters ai n't gold there 's an ocean of despair there are people livin ' there they 're unhappy each and every day but hell is not fashion so whatcha tryin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sold everybody wants 2 tell what 's already been told what 's the use of money if u ai n't gon na break the mold even at the center of the fire there is cold and all that glitters ai n't gold .

( We hear a pounding on the other side of the wall . ) Ooooh , lawsy ! My date 's right on time . ( MEMPHIS begins to slip through a hole in the wall . ) PRINCE Where you going ? MEMPHIS A little nocturnal naughtiness my friends . I can only hang with you guys so long , and then my brain goes numb . ( Disappears from sight ) PRINCE Are n't he afraid of rats ? CHAVEZ Naah ! Who jou theenk he hang wif in there ? Rats . Oh , my gooseness  --  he loves those rats . PRINCE Cause they dance good I betcha . They taste good too betcha  --  I mean , when you don ' got nothing else to eat . My old girl ate rat when she was out in the fields killing them to protect the rice . The soldiers don ' give her but three grains of rice in brown water , so she hungry all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between her legs and save it till nighttime and eat it . She try feed me too , but I don ' like no rat . p. 10 CHAVEZ What happened to jour old girl ? PRINCE The soldiers exploded herso I fly away . They shoot me too , but I got on boat and came here . CHAVEZ Too bad . I myself have indulged in the meat of a rat . But some good friends get exploded sometimes . My old boy used to feed me big chunks of jamon  --  until he got sick . Leesen , jou think jou could fly ober to the butcher and pick me up a ribeye ehsteak . Dis girl trying to make me a vegetarian . It 's okay for a leetle bit , but sheesh , enough 's enough . I want some beef and some beef-by products . PRINCE Still ca n't . CHAVEZ Are n't jou healed yet ? It 's been like two years . I thought wings grew back fast . PRINCE No . Mine 's do n't anyways . I ca n't even heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing . Memphis dances . But me ? Nothing . CHAVEZ That 's not true . Jou got a porpose alright . It 's jus'all in secret still . But one day , jou gon na soarprise everybody . PRINCE Really ? CHAVEZ Jeah ( Reciting a poem ) Inside every animal , there 's a heart with a beat . Sometimes its meat is tasty  --  sometimes it 's sweet . But everybody got a soul , from the eagle to the mole . So if jour life turns bad , remember all the chances jou once had . There is no living brother that 's better than another . p. 11 PRINCE ( Applauding wildly ) That was delightful as fresh lotus blossom drifting into mouth of a Khymer ( Kuh-my ) river . CHAVEZ Jeahwhatever . Uhm , maybe jou would n't mind , uhm , walking over to the butcher 's , huh , buddy ? ? PRINCE Surebut what 's a boochair 's ? CHAVEZ Jou are a foreigner , are n't jou ? !

That 's not his name anymore . He 's Mister Sign now . PRINCE Ohthat 's a nice name too . SignMr . Signvery powerful CHAVEZ That girl of ours is bothering me . She keeps acting all ehcrazy . Jou think she needs a doctor ? ( MEMPHIS enters covered in black grease . ) PRINCE A Krou Khmer ? CHAVEZ A Santero ? A Curandero ? MEMPHIS Maybe just a G.P. will do . A regular ole family doctor . Someone sensible . p. 12 CHAVEZ That was fast . And look who 's talkin'about sensible  --  Mr. Rat-lovin ' Greasy Stove . Did one explode on jou ? MEMPHIS Sort of . My girl , Luna , and I had a little tussle in apartment 6D . I think they 'll be surprised when they get home . Help me wash this off , before they come looking . ( Lights cross to a church graveyard. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to communicate with his dad the SILVER SURFER . NORRIN places a homemade lightning rod on a mound of dirt that he has built up with his hands . HE stares at it for a moment in silence . RADD Why are people always afraid to come in here at night ? It 's the best time to come . Quiet . And whether you 're dead or not , I need to talk to you . People always talk to people who are n't here anymore in this place , so I thought it would be the best place to do it intalk to you , I mean . ( Pause ) Why did you leave ? I know Earth 's not so hot anymore , but it 's home . ( It begins to thunder . A flash of lightning hits NORRIN 's rod , then suddenly , the SILVER SURFER appears in the distance . His presence is more like light than physical . ) Dad ? ! SILVER SURFER Yaow ! What a headache I have ! Intergalactic travel is not what it used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time-lag , but now . Sssheesh ! I 'm getting old , Junior . How ya doing , son ? RADD How ya doing , son ? ! You disappear for years and then it 's just " How ya doing , Son ? ! " SILVER SURFER UhhmmLong time no see ? ( NORRIN shakes his head in disgust . ) Sorry . Help me here . What do you want me to say ? That I love you ? That I miss you ? That I wish you were with me in my cosmic hell ? I had to leave . Otherwise you would just have grown up to be like me . I would n't wish that on anybody . p. 14 RADD But I 'm like you anyway . I read all the time and I love school . You did too . SILVER SURFER And look at where it got me . I was so goody-goody and self-righteous that I turned on my own father , because he made a mistake . And when I would n't talk to him then he RADD Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died . Trust me . You do not want me around . ( NORRIN looks hurt . ) Come one , kid . Do n't be like that . I did the best thing . You wan na , I du n no , talk or something ? How 's school ? RADD Easy . Boring . SILVER SURFER You , uhm , got any girlfriends or anything yet ? RADD Nahwell , there 's one girl , but she 's crazy . SILVER SURFER That 's too bad . But crazy can be interesting . There 's this rock monster named Thanos  --  a real nut case . Anyway , he 's always trying to get inside my mind . He 's scary , but I find I learn a lot from monsters like him . He  --  RADD She 's not that crazy . SILVER SURFER So what 's the problem ? RADD I ca n't just tell you the whole story , just like that , like I saw you yesterday . We got ta spend some time , Dad . p. 15 SILVER SURFER I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got people to save , planets to repopulate . And I 'm just not fun , Norrin . RADD Why 'd you do that then ? Why 'd you name me after you , if you did n't care about me ? SILVER SURFER I named you after the man I used to be . Now he was a good man . I 'm not . I 'm a terror in tin foil , a surfing sardine , a  --  RADD You sound sad . SILVER SURFER I do n't like my job , but I have to do it . How 's your mother ? RADD She 's going back to school at night , to be a math teacher . SILVER SURFER That 's great . I wish ISay hello to her for me , okay ? RADD She just cries whenever I mention your name  --  so I do n't anymore . SILVER SURFER You 're a strange kid , Norrin . I mean , you 're so  --  I do n't know  --  sensible . You turned out good . That 's one thing to smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You see what a mess I am . RADD I do n't care about any of that . I just  --  ( He begins to cry . ) I just  --  ( SILVER SURFER moves to NORRIN and hugs him . When HE does so , a flash of lightning hits them. ) p. 16 SILVER SURFER I could n't not touch my own son could I ? But now your problems just got worse . You got my energy , and my power . You 've got lightning inside you . Use it wisely . I 's jettin '  --  love is only a Flash sometimes ( SILVER SURFER disappears into the night . ) RADD I do n't understand ! ! Do n't go ! ( Pause ) Other kids get bedtime stories and a quarter under their pillow when a tooth comes out . But me , I just get these strange little moments in time with a man I think 's my father but I 'm not exactly sure who he is because he does n't really act like I expect a dad of mine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around more times than not  --  to walk me to school every now and then and answer my silliest questions  --  like why is the sky blue and where does snow come from ? I see other boys playing ball with their dads and I feel so alone then , because I can see them looking into their own father 's eyes and there 's light there that tells them who they are and where they come from  --  but me , all I 've got is a flash ( Lights cross to the DIAZ apartment. ) @x At the front door of the DIAZ apartment . DELFIN enters after a long day at work . DIAZ Connie ! Dylan ! Where is everybody ? ( DYLAN enters from her bedroom , blasting the Fugees " Killing Me Softly " on a small boom box . ) Turn that down , Dylan ! I 've got a headache as big as a double-king bedspring . O'CONNER-DIAZ Hey , blood . Wuz up ? ! DIAZ Blood ? I left Dad and now I 'm Blood . GreatDid you finish your  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Tell me true now , when there 's a race war going down soon and us right in the middle of it , homey ? DIAZ You 're trying to tell me something , but I have no idea  --  ( HE turns off the tape . ) Oh ! You were watching " Cops " again , were n't you ? O'CONNER-DIAZ That show is lame . Now I watch " Underage Criminals and Such Stuff as Dreams Are Not Made Of " . It 's real " bad " , do n't cha know ! And that means good . DIAZ Did n't I tell you not to watch any TV till your mother or I come home ? Huh ? Did n't I ? ! Answer me ! p. 18 O'CONNER-DIAZ ( Bored ) I do n't know . Did you ? DIAZ Do n't use that tone of voice with me , young lady ! You do n't need to watch those crazy shows and put more crazy stuff into your crazy head . O'CONNER-DIAZ That 's a lot of crazies . DIAZ You 're getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Thanks ! DIAZ You 're a frightening child , Dylan . O'CONNER-DIAZ You should know . You made me . DIAZ I made a beautiful , trusting , smart little girl . But you 're something else . Who are you supposed to be today ? O'CONNER-DIAZ Shah-ree Tanesha Bahree . DIAZ I see . Well , Shah-ree , I 'm going to have some dinner . Want some ? O'CONNER-DIAZ No , man . I do n't eat with the oppressor . DIAZ How can I be the oppressor ? I 'm Puerto Rican , for Godssake ! O'CONNER-DIAZ But you work for the " man " . DIAZ I work for a bedding store . I sell beds , and mattresses , and futons . Does n't everybody need a bed regardless of race , creed , or color , Shah-ree ? p. 19 O'CONNER-DIAZ The people just think they need beds , because the man needs them to buy so he can make a profit from their backs . Floors work just as good , and save your green for the revolution . DIAZ Who am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? DIAZ Who 's that ? ! I thought you knew everything about being Black in America . O'CONNER-DIAZ She 's probably from England . There 's a lot of progressive black folk from there . DIAZ You 're impossible . Did your mother call ? O'CONNER-DIAZ Yeah . DIAZ Well , what did she say ? O'CONNER-DIAZ I do n't listen to Whitey . DIAZ What did you just say ? ? O'CONNER-DIAZ She said she was going to be late because somebody 's dying . So start without her . DIAZ Great . I spent all day missing my family and then I come home to an insane daughter and an absent wife . O'CONNER-DIAZ Did you really miss me , Dad ? DIAZ You , yes  --  but not Angela , and especially not Shah-ree . Come here . ( DYLAN goes to him and he hugs her. ) p. 20 O'CONNER-DIAZ Maybe I will eat with you I 'll just try not to enjoy it . DIAZ No , please . I would hate to make you compromise . Maybe you should never eat again , Dylan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's oppressed . O'CONNER-DIAZ Why does Mom like working with people who keep dying on her ? It must make her sad . DIAZ I think she figures it 's worth it to be sad for a while if she can make her patients feel better for the short time they do have left . ( CONNIE enters quietly , unnoticed by DYLAN and DELFIN . ) O'CONNER-DIAZ I could n't do it . It would give me the creeps . Seeing people 's hair fall out and blood come spurting out of their mouths  --  O'CONNER Blood does not come spurting out of their mouths  --  not usually anyway . O'CONNER-DIAZ That 's what I read somewhere  --  that people with AIDS bleed all the time . O'CONNER Where ? The World Weekly News or the National Enquirer ? O'CONNER-DIAZ I think it was from a book you gave me . O'CONNER Impossible . ( Kicking off her shoes ) Somebody rub my feet . Please . p. 21 DIAZ Twist my arm , baby . O'CONNER-DIAZ Oh , no ! You guys are gon na start swapping spit right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my room . ( DYLAN exits as CHAVEZ and MEMPHIS enter . THEY silently mock DELFIN and CONNIE necking . ) O'CONNER Swap spit ? We have n't done that in a long time . DIAZ No . And it does n't sound that appealing really . Except maybe with you . O'CONNER Ditto . Only with you . ( DELFIN puts on some music . We hear Bob Dylan singing " Lay , Lady , Lay " . ) I love this song O'CONNER-DIAZ ( offstage ) Gross ! Dylan again ! ( DELFIN moves to kiss CONNIE , but the sound of CHAVEZ and MEMPHIS imitating them and play-kissing , interrupts them . ) DIAZ I swear those animals are almost human . O'CONNER Nothey 're much smarter than we 'll ever be . ( Lights cross to a street corner as the music segues into the next scene. ) @x At a street corner , NORRIN counts his money , as DASHAREE walks in behind him quietly , suddenly pulling the money out of his hand . RADD Hey ! You 're supposed to hand me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ? You ? ! What are you gon na do about it ? ! Nothing ! I tell you how it goes down , because I am from the Robert Moses projects and you live in the sissy Clara Barton projects with your freaky sisters  --  who , by the way , wo n't go out with me . People who live at Barton 's always fear people who live in Moses  --  that 's a law of nature , son . RADD It 's all there . Just give it to me . DASHAREE First I must warn you , do not clean it with your tongue or against your thigh  --  or something might get hurt . ( Hands NORRIN a very new , very sharp utility knife/box cutter ) You know , it 's a lot easier just to go to a hardware store  --  oh , but that 's right.Your Mama works in the closest hardware store , do n't she ? What is she  --  a dyke ? I mean I never known women who liked hardware , except those kind . RADD Does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important  --  she is. p. 23 DASHAREE Oh , mmhhm . A Mama 's boy-toy . That 's what you are , Norrin . Borin ' Norrin , he 's so dull , he got nothin ' in his skull . ( Suddenly there 's a loud clap of thunder . Dark sheets of rain begin to fall . NORRIN grabs DASHAREE 's arm and a bright flash illuminates the two . ) Aaahhh ! ! ( DASHAREE collapses . NORRIN picks up the knife . ) RADD This stuff 's gon na come in handy . ( Looking up at the sky ) Thanks , Dad . ( Lights cross to the Projects. ) @x In front of the Moses Projects . EDWARD 85X is waiting impatiently for DASHAREE . After a few moments , DASHAREE comes running in carrying a brown paper bag . EDWARD 85X You sure took a long dang time . Did you get it ? Serita hates to wait . DASHAREE Yeah . But I had to look in every hardware store downtown before I found it . I finally had to go to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's kinda nice . I was surprised , because her son is such a fool  --  but he 's got a mean grip . Look how he burned me  --  but anyway  --  ( Pulling out a long , white hose ) It 's perfect , ai n't it ? EDWARD 85X Dasharee ? DASHAREE Is it too long ? EDWARD 85X DashareeI asked you to pick up a long , white ROSE ! Not a hose ! A Rose ! Get it ? Flower with thorns . They 're like  --  ( Indicating its size with his hands ) yay-big and smell real good and ladies really like them . DASHAREE Oh . I was wondering why Serita needed a long white hose . I thought maybe her Ma was putting in a new washing machine and she wanted it to be all clean and shiny . White rubber always looks newer than other colors. p. 25 EDWARD 85X You a piece of work , Dasharee , you know that ? DASHAREE You want me to go back to the store ? EDWARD 85X It 's too late now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her it was my fault ! She hates me already . EDWARD 85X I do n't know what I 'll tell her ( SERITA enters , followed by BONITA , LUCITA , &amp; CHIQUITA . THEY each have a scar down their right cheek . ) Hello , my queen . SERITA What happened ? EDWARD 85X I  --  what do you mean ? Nothing . SERITA You got that pinched-up look you always got when you messed something up . DASHAREE ( Throwing himself at her feet ) Okay ! Okay ! I did it ! Do n't be mad , okay ? ! SERITA What is your problem , Dash ? EDWARD 85X Get up , fool . Ignore him . Let 's go . ( THEY break off into couples : EDWARD &amp; SERITA smooch ; BONITA &amp; LUCITA file their nails ; CHIQUITA &amp; DASHAREE flirtatiously walk around each other . ) CHIQUITA Hi , Dasharee ! p. 26 DASHAREE Hi , Chiquita . CHIQUITA Thanks for the little present . It fits just right . DASHAREE Why are n't you wearing it ? CHIQUITA I wan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na be my boyfriend , do n't you ? DASHAREE Yeah , I guess so I got something else for you . ( Handing her the white hose ) It 's long , huh ? CHIQUITA ( Angry ) What am I supposed to do with this ? ! Wrap it around your neck ? ? DASHAREE That does n't sound very comfortable . Rubber can get warm . CHIQUITA ( Throwing the hose at him ) Buy me something else . Something I can be proud to own . DASHAREE Like what ? CHIQUITA A necklace or something . Go ! ( DASHAREE hurries off ) And do n't come back with no hardware . DASHAREE Yes , Chiquita  --  I mean , no Chiquita . BONITA You got that boy running in circles for you . LUCITA I do n't know why he bothers . You ai n't never satisfied . p. 27 BONITA I saw a movie on T.V. like that just last night . There was this lady  --  but she was n't really a lady  --  she was like a vampire . And she went around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't like  --  and then  --  LUCITA Your stories are always too long , Bonita . What 's your point ? Are you saying Chiquita here could be a vampire ? BONITA No  --  CHIQUITA You better not be saying that ! Shoot ! I 'll jump you up and down and all around . BONITA No . I was just saying that you looked like this lady . She was real pretty , but she never had enough blood . So she could never be happy . That 's the part reminded me of you . CHIQUITA I could be happy all right . It 's the boys I go out with that have to worry . LUCITA That 's for sure ( Music comes up , as lights cross to DYLAN in bed. ) @x We hear Bobby McFerrin 's " Do n't Worry , Be Happy " as lights come up on DYLAN , in bed . Her eyes are open and staring . In front of her are MEMPHIS , CHAVEZ &amp; PRINCE . THEY are dressed in identical blue denim overalls , and THEY each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using her bed as the table , and her toes as the balls . O'CONNER-DIAZ ( SHE screams . ) Aaahhh ! ! This is just a dream . Not real . Not real ! I can open my eyes and wake up  --  but shoot my eyes are open . ( SHE screams again , louder and longer . ) Aaahhhhh ! ( NORRIN enters with the utility knife hidden in his pocket . As HE enters , the animals fade back into darkness . ) RADD What are you screaming for ? It 's just me . O'CONNER-DIAZ I thought  --  Did you see  --  How did you get in ? RADD Kitchen window . O'CONNER-DIAZ I was having this horrible dream , where Memphis , Chavez , and Prince were stuck in one of those black velvet paintings of animals playing poker except instead of poker they were playing pool with my feet and  --  RADD Here . ( Hands her the utility knife ) Is it the kind you wanted ? p. 29 O'CONNER-DIAZ It 's perfect ! Just like all the girls from Moses use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shame . O'CONNER-DIAZ What 's that supposed to mean ? RADD It means watch out . They do n't play games . They really like cutting people . They got scars down to their  --  really long scars . I seen them .
