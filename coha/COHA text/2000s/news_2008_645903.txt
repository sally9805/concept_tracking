About 500 congregants and clergy from Bay Area churches packed into Holy Rosary Parish hall in Antioch on Monday night for a spirited town hall meeting to demand a broad-based approach to helping people avoid foreclosure . <p> " Our purpose is to stand up for real change , " said Raul DeAnda , a church member addressing the packed room of men , women and children , many waving colorful flags with slogans in English and Spanish , such as " families first " and " good business sense . " A strong desire for action was palpable in the prayers and testimony from foreclosed homeowners . There was also some anger stemming from a backlash against the massive bailout bill enacted by Congress this month . While the $700 billion legislation assists financial institutions , it does not include specific provisions for struggling homeowners . <p> The theme of helping families , not just bankers , underlay many of the evening 's speeches . <p> The meeting , which was Webcast to supporters in 20 cities , kicked off a national , faith-based campaign by PICO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oakland . <p> PICO , which stands for People Improving Communities Through Organizing , calls for a systematic approach to modifying problematic mortgages instead of treating them on a case-by-case basis . With 1.2 million homes nationwide already lost to foreclosure and another 2.2 million at risk over the next year , it is urgent to " stop the bleeding , " both to save homes and to help stabilize the housing market , PICO says . <p> Similar events are planned in Missouri , Florida , New York and Massachusetts , to be followed Nov. 17-19 by a meeting in Washington with leaders from Congress , the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . <p> " In November , hundreds of people will go to Washington , D.C. , with one common message : Work with us , " said Gloria Cooper , an organizer with a PICO affiliate in San Diego , to the cheers of the crowd . " We want to keep our families in their homes . " <p> The group wants Treasury to require banks that receive bailout money to adopt protocols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lowering interest rates and reducing balances to make payments affordable . <p> The faith-based groups join a growing chorus calling for streamlined modification of troubled mortgages . FDIC Chair Sheila Bair has championed the idea in testimony on Capitol Hill . Bair used such an approach for borrowers of IndyMac Bank after the FDIC took it over this summer . Congressional Democrats now say other banks should follow that example . <p> Despite the groundswell of support , mass loan modifications still face obstacles , including the inability of some borrowers to make payments of any reasonable size , and the fact that most loans have been divided into complex financial instruments owned by many investors . <p> " This is the first real gathering of the faith community on this issue , but it also includes community organizations and people affected at the grassroots level , " said Adam Kruggel , director of Contra Costa Interfaith Supporting Community Organization , an affiliation of 25 congregations , which co-sponsored the event . After meetings throughout the county over the past year , his group identified " foreclosure as the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . <p> " I 've heard countless stories of families whose mortgage payments ballooned out of control ; they could not contact their lender ; they could not renegotiate to stay in their home , " Kruggel said . <p> Contra Costa County , particularly the eastern section , where rampant overbuilding occurred , has been hit hard by the foreclosure crisis . More than 3,660 Contra Costa homes were repossessed by banks in the third quarter , the most of any Bay Area county . Another 4,100 households received notices that they were in default on their mortgages in the same time period . <p> " It is devastating , " said Contra Costa Supervisor Federal Glover , speaking before the event . " We have a lot of people that have done well for years that are now finding themselves homeless because they 've been foreclosed on . We also see an increasing crime rate and blight in communities . " <p> Glover and other county officials pledged to pressure banks " to be creative and find ways to help people stay in their homes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cheers when he took the microphone to say that his bank would try to work with borrowers . <p> Kevin Stein , associate director of the California Reinvestment Coalition , said the growing momentum behind the idea of streamlined loan modifications comes in tandem with the continued growth of foreclosures and their ripple effect . <p> " For more and more people , reality is starting to set in that foreclosures just keep increasing and this is having devastating consequences , " he said , speaking before the event . <p> Paul Leonard , director of the California office of the Center for Responsible Lending , said the involvement of the faith-based community is " natural and welcome . " <p> Besides the FDIC ' s example at IndyMac , the recent settlement between state attorneys general and Bank of America/Countrywide provides another model for policymakers to consider in crafting better approaches to stemming foreclosures , Leonard said . <p> In that settlement , announced early this month , BofA said it would provide up to $8.4 billion in interest rate and principal reductions on as many as 400,000 mortgages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have suffered or face foreclosure . <p> " The fact that the federal government is investing so much money without an apparent clear focus on the need of preventing foreclosure draws a clearer picture of what is needed for many who are worried about the broader economic consequences of foreclosures as well as the neighborhood and personal tragedies , " he said .
