Chapter One DOMESTIC TRANQUILLITY prevailed . Flavia Petrelli , the reigning diva of La Scala , stood in the warm kitchen and chopped onions . In separate heaps in front of her lay a pile of plum tomatoes , two cloves of garlic chopped into fine slices , and two plump-bottomed aubergines . She stood at the marble counter , bent over the vegetables , and she sang , filling the room with the golden tones of her soprano voice . Occasionally , she pushed at a lock of dark hair with the back of her wrist , but it was no sooner anchored behind her ear than it sprang loose and fell across her cheek . At the other end of the vast room that took up much of the top floor of the fourteenth-century Venetian palazzo , its owner and Flavia 's lover , Brett Lynch , sprawled across a beige sofa , bare feet propped against the far arm , head resting on the other , following the score of I Puritani , the music of which blared out , neighbours be damned , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to fill the room , and the singing Elvira prepared to go mad - for the second time . Eerily , two Elviras sang in the room : the first the one Flavia had recorded in London five months before and who now sang from the speakers ; the second was the voice of the woman chopping the onions . Occasionally , as she sang in perfect union with her own recorded voice , Flavia broke off to ask , ' Ouf , whoever said I had a middle register ? ' or ' Is that a B flat the violins are supposed to be playing ? ' After each interruption , her voice returned to the music , her hands to the chopping . To her left , a large frying-pan sat on a low flame , a pool of olive oil waiting for the first vegetables . From four floors below , the doorbell rang . ' I 'll get it , ' Brett said , placing the score face down on the floor and standing . ' Probably the Jehovah 's Witnesses . They come on Sundays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair from her face with the back of her hand , and returned her attention to the onions and to Elvira 's delirium , in the midst of which she continued to sing . Barefoot , glad of the warmth of the apartment on this late January afternoon , Brett walked across the beamed floor and out into the entrance hall , picked up the speakerphone that hung beside the front door , and asked , ' Chi ? ' A man 's voice answered , speaking Italian , ' We 're from the museum . With papers from Dottor Semenzato . ' Strange that the director of the museum at the Doge 's Palace would send papers , especially on a Sunday , but perhaps he had been alarmed by the letter Brett had sent him from China - though he certainly had n't sounded that way earlier in the week - and wanted something read before the appointment he had grudgingly given for Tuesday morning . ' Bring them up , if you do n't mind . Top floor . ' Brett replaced the phone and pressed the button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door and called to Flavia across the weeping violins , ' Someone from the museum . Papers . ' Flavia nodded , picked up the first of the aubergines and sliced it in half , then , without missing a beat , returned to the serious business of losing her mind for love . Brett went back towards the front door , paused to bend down and turn over the corner of a carpet , then opened the door to the apartment . Footsteps approached from below , and two men came into sight , pausing at the bottom of the final ramp of steps . ' There are only sixteen more , ' Brett said , smiling down at them in welcome , then , suddenly aware of the frigid air of the stairwell that edged in , covered one bare foot with the other . They stood on the steps below and looked up towards the open door . The first one carried a large manila envelope . They paused for a moment before beginning the final flight and Brett smiled again , calling down encouragement : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair-haired , smiled back and started up the last flight of steps . His companion , taller and darker , took a deep breath , then came up behind him . When the first man got to the door , he paused and waited for the other to join him . ' Dottoressa Lynch ? ' the blond one asked , pronouncing her last name in the Italian fashion . ' Yes , ' she answered , stepping back from the door to allow them to enter . Politely , both of them muttered , ' Permesso , ' as they stepped into the apartment . The first one , whose light hair was cut very close to his head and who had attractive dark eyes , held out the envelope . ' These are the papers , Dottoressa . ' As he handed them to her , he said , ' Dottor Semenzato asked that you look at them immediately . ' Very soft , very polite . The tall one smiled and turned away , his attention distracted by a mirror that hung to the left of the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flap of the envelope , which was held together with red sealing wax . The blond man stepped a bit closer to her , as if to take the envelope from her and help her open it , but suddenly he moved past her and grabbed her from behind by both arms , his grip fierce and tight . The envelope fell , bounced off her bare feet , and landed between her and the second man . He brushed it aside with his foot , as if careful of its contents , and stepped up close in front of her . As he moved , the other one tightened his grip on her arms . The tall one brought his face down from his considerable height and said , voice low and very deep , ' You do n't want to keep that appointment with Dottor Semenzato . ' She felt anger before she felt fear , and she spoke out of the first . ' Let me go . And get out of here . ' She twisted sharply in an attempt to pull herself free of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms to her sides . Behind her , the music soared up and Flavia 's double voice filled the room . So perfectly did she sing the passage that no one could tell there were two voices , not one , that sang of pain and love and loss . Brett turned her face towards the music , but then by a conscious act of will stopped the motion and asked , turning back to the man in front of her , ' Who are you ? What do you want ? ' His voice changed as did his face , both growing ugly . ' Do n't ask questions , bitch . ' Again , she tried to twist herself free , but it was impossible . Bracing her weight on one foot , she kicked backward with the other , but her bare heel had no effect on the man who held her . From behind her , she heard the one who held her say , ' All right . Do it . ' She was turning her head to look at him when the first blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sudden , explosive pain pulled her forward with such force that she almost broke free from the man who held her , but he pulled her back and jerked her upright . The one in front of her hit her again , this time catching her below the left breast , and her response was the same , an involuntary motion that pulled her body forward to protect itself from this awful pain . Then quickly , so quickly that she lost count of how many times he did it , he began to punch at her body , catching her repeatedly on the breast and ribs . Behind her , Flavia 's voices sang now of the blissful future she looked forward to , so soon to be Arturo 's bride , and then he hit her on the side of the head . Her right ear buzzed , and then she could hear the music only with the left . She was conscious of just one thing : she could n't make any noise . She could n't scream , cry out , moan . The soprano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lip split open under the man 's fist . The one behind her released her right arm . There was no longer any need to restrain her , but he kept one hand on her arm to hold her upright and pulled her around until she was facing him . ' Do n't keep your meeting with Dottor Semenzato , ' he said , voice still very low and polite . But she was gone from him , no longer listening to what he said , dimly conscious of the music and the pain , and the dark fear that these men might kill her . Her head hung and she saw only their feet . She sensed the taller one make a sudden motion towards her , and she felt warmth on her legs and face . She had lost control of her body and smelled the sharp stench of her own urine . Tasting blood , she saw it drip on to the floor and splash on to their shoes . She hung between them , thinking only that she could n't make a sound and wishing only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself up into a ball to reduce the pain that came at her from all over her body . And all the while this was happening , the double voice of Flavia Petrelli filled the room with the sounds of joy , soaring up over the voices of the chorus and the tenor , her sweet lover . With greater effort than she had applied to anything in her life , Brett raised her head and looked into the eyes of the tall one , who now stood directly in front of her . He smiled back at her with a smile so intimate that she might have seen it on a lover 's face . Slowly , he reached out and cupped her left breast in his hand , squeezing it gently , and he whispered , ' Want some more , cara ? It 's better with a man . ' Her reaction was entirely involuntary . Her fist caught his face and glanced off without doing any harm , but the sudden motion pulled her free of the hand of the other one . She fell back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of its solidity under her back . She felt herself sinking down , felt her sweater being pulled up by the heavy grain of the brick wall behind her . Slowly , slowly , as in a freeze-frame film , she sank down against the wall , its rough face scratching at her flesh as gravity pulled at her entire body . Things grew very confused . She heard Flavia 's voice singing the cabaletta , but then she heard Flavia 's other voice , no longer singing , scream in fury , ' Who are you ? What are you doing ? ' ' Do n't stop singing , Flavia , ' she tried to say , but she could n't remember how to say it . She sank to the floor , head tilted towards the entry to the living room , where she saw the real Flavia outlined against the light that streamed in from the other room , heard the same outline of glorious music that splashed in with her , and she saw the large chopping knife in Flavia 's hand . ' No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Flavia launched herself across the space that separated her from the two men . As surprised as she , they had no time to react , and the knife slashed across the upraised forearm of the shorter one . He howled in pain and pulled the arm to him , covering the wound with his other hand . Blood surged up through the fabric of his jacket . Another freeze frame . Then the taller man started towards the still-open door . Flavia pulled the knife back level with her hip and took two steps towards him . The wounded one kicked at her with his left foot , catching her on the side of the knee . She fell but landed kneeling , knife still pulled back beside her . Whatever communication passed between the two men was entirely silent , but at the same instant they both broke towards the door . The tall one paused long enough to snatch at the envelope , but the kneeling Flavia lashed out at his hand with the knife , and he backed away , leaving it on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few steps after them but stopped and went back into the apartment , kicking the door closed behind her . She knelt beside the supine form of the other woman . ' Brett , Brett , ' she called , looking down at her . The bottom half of her face was streaked with blood that streamed from her nose and lip and from a patch of broken skin that ran across the left side of her forehead . She lay with one knee bent under her , her sweater bunched up under her chin , breasts exposed . ' Brett , ' Flavia said again and for a moment believed that this utterly motionless woman was dead . She pushed that idea away immediately and placed her hand against the side of Brett 's throat . As slowly as dawn on a heavy winter morning , one eye opened , then the other , though , beginning to swell , it could open only halfway . ' Stai bene ? ' Flavia asked . The only answer she heard was a low moan . But it was an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't worry , cara . They 'll be here soon . ' She ran into the other room and reached for the telephone . For a second , she did n't recognize what it was that prevented her from picking up the phone , but then she saw the bloody knife , her hand white-knuckled around the handle . She dropped it to the floor and grabbed the receiver . With stiff fingers , she jabbed out 113 . After ten rings , a woman 's voice answered and asked her what she wanted . ' This is an emergency . I need an ambulance . In Cannaregio . ' Bored , the voice asked the exact address . ' Cannaregio 6134 . ' ' I 'm sorry , signora . It 's Sunday and we have only one ambulance . I 'll have to put your name on the list . ' Flavia 's voice rose . ' There 's a woman here who 's hurt . Someone tried to kill her . She has to get to the hospital . ' The voice took on a tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signora . We have only one ambulance , and there are two calls for it to make first . As soon as it 's free , we 'll send it to you . ' When she had no response from Flavia , the voice asked , ' Signora , are you still there ? If you give me the address again , I 'll put your name on the list . Signora ? Signora ? ' In response to Flavia 's silence , the woman at the other end broke the connection , leaving Flavia with the receiver in her hand , wishing she still had the knife . Hand trembling , Flavia replaced the receiver and went back into the hall . Brett remained where she had left her but had somehow managed to turn over on to her side and lay still , holding one arm across her chest , moaning . Flavia knelt beside her . ' Brett , I have to get a doctor . ' Flavia heard a muffled noise , and Brett 's hand came slowly towards her own . Her fingers barely made contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Cold , ' was the only thing she said . Flavia got to her feet and went into the bedroom . She ripped the covers from the bed and dragged them back into the foyer , where she spread them over the motionless form on the floor . She opened the door to the apartment , not bothering to check through the spyhole to see if the two men had returned . Leaving the door open behind her , she ran down two flights of stairs and pounded heavily on the door of the apartment below . After a few moments , the door was opened by a middle-aged man , tall and balding , who held a cigarette in one hand and a book in the other . ' Luca , ' Flavia gasped , fighting the impulse to scream as this went on and on and no one came to help her lover , ' Brett 's hurt . She 's got to have a doctor . ' Suddenly her voice cracked and she was sobbing . ' Please , Luca , please , get a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of speech . Continues ...
