Section : Search and Discovery The behavior of strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gases may hold clues to the universal behavior of many-body systems . <p> What a difference is made by one-half quantum unit of spin . Atoms with integer spins  --  bosons  --  can collapse into a common ground state when sufficiently cold ; the result is a collective state known as a Bose  --  Einstein condensate ( BEC ) . But atoms with half-integer spins  --  fermions  --  are excluded from occupying the same quantum states . The lowest-energy configuration they can reach is to fill all levels up to the Fermi energy  --  the highest level that would be occupied at absolute zero . <p> It was formidable enough to form a BEC . Creating a degenerate Fermi gas proved even more difficult , largely because Fermi statistics prevents identical particles from participating in the kind of head-on collisions required for the evaporative cooling that takes a gas to ultracold temperatures . The cooling problem was solved , and a degenerate Fermi gas formed , in 1999 by a team from JILA , NIST and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHYSICS TODAY , October 1999 , page 17 ) . <p> Since then , a number of groups around the world have built up the expertise to form degenerate Fermi gases as well as BECs . The door is open to explore further the interface between the bosonic and fermionic worlds . Recently several groups have created bosonic molecules from fermionic atoms , and they have found that the molecules live long enough to allow the formation of a molecular BEC . It should now be very interesting to study what happens when ultracold bosonic molecules dissociate into their fermionic constituents . <p> A prime motivation for the current experiments , however , is the desire to make atoms team up not as molecules  --  two tightly bound fermions  --  but as Cooper pairs  --  fermions that are loosely correlated in momentum space . The paired fermions would resemble the electron pairs in a **25;1901;TOOLONG superconductor . Because such fermion pairs are a composite boson , they can occupy a common ground state and hence become a superfluid . <p> There would be no hope of seeing such a superfluid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments . For these experiments , the gases are typically cooled to a few tenths of the thermal temperature T F corresponding to the Fermi energy ( Typically , T F 1 K. ) <p> Fortunately , theorists have predicted that a novel superfluid phase might , indeed , exist at such temperatures  --  provided the degenerate Fermi gas is in the regime where interatomic forces are strong and attractive. ( n1 ) <p> Happily , atomic researchers can control the sign and strength of such interatomic forces by applying a magnetic field . A number of current experiments are in the right regime to form a superfluid ; the experimental challenge now is to prove that it 's there . <p> Tuning the magnetic force to a particular strength may create Cooper pairs ; tuning it to a different field value may promote the formation of molecules . The magnetic field thus becomes a powerful control knob , allowing researchers to explore the behavior of atomic gases as a function of the interaction forces . Many researchers dream one day of taking a system of particles smoothly from a molecular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for interest in the current experiments on degenerate Fermi gases : Ultracold , low-density atomic gases provide a useful environment to probe and control quantum phenomena . They offer a way to explore , in a tabletop experiment , the universal behavior of systems of strongly interacting particles . Theorists expect  --  and experimenters are beginning to show  --  that , in the strong-interaction region , the behavior of the atoms becomes universal , or independent of the details of the atomic potential. ( n2 , n3 ) Theorist Jason Ho of Ohio State University notes that studies in the region of strong interactions , where perturbation approximations no longer hold , should shed light on some of the most intractable problems in a variety of fields . Tuning the interaction <p> The applied magnetic field is able to control the sign and size of the interatomic forces through its impact on a parameter known as the S-wave scattering length , a . When a is much less than the interparticle spacing , the scattering cross section varies as a and the mean-field interaction energy goes as na , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy is the average potential energy felt by one atom due to the presence of all the other atoms in the gas . ) <p> For most values of magnetic field , a is small and relatively independent of the magnetic field . For certain values , however , the magnetic field causes the collisional energy between two atoms to approach the energy of a quasibound molecular state . At those values , known as Feshbach resonances , the interaction is greatly intensified and a diverges , as seen in figure 1 . On one side of the resonance , a is positive , which signals a repulsive force between atoms ; on the other side , it 's negative and the force is attractive . Tuning the magnetic field knob through this region can thus bring about dramatic changes in the behavior of the gas . <p> When a exceeds the interatomic spacing , it 's no longer valid to express the cross section or the mean-field energy in terms of a . Doing so would cause those quantities to grow without limit , in violation of the unitarity principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section . Instead , the mean-field energy approaches a constant fraction of the Fermi energy . Without the dependence on a , the only length scale in the problem is the interparticle spacing , and the behavior should be universal for all strongly interacting particles . <p> Also in the region of large a , many-body effects become important , and the system behavior can no longer be described as the sum of interactions between pairs of atoms . A number of theorists from different fields have suggested that , in the unitarity limit , such many-body correlations result in an effective attractive interaction . <p> Several recent experiments performed on degenerate Fermi gases near Feshbach resonances have seen some of the effects predicted for large a . John Thomas and his coworkers at Duke University saw a hint of universal interaction in the expansion of a degenerate Fermi gas of lithium-6 atoms. ( n4 ) Cindy Regal and Deborah Jin of the JILA-NIST-Colorado team in Boulder saw saturation effects in their measurements of the mean-field energy in a potassium-40 gas. ( n5 ) Christophe Salomon of the Ecole Normale Suprieure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ENS , the FOM Institute in Amsterdam , and the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow found evidence that the interaction in their ( n6 ) Li gas remains finite and attractive throughout the resonance region. ( n6 ) That finding was echoed by data from Wolfgang Ketterle and his team from MIT. ( n7 ) <p> Ketterle says that , although in hindsight one can make a case for the breakdown of the scattering-length picture , he was completely surprised to see such strong interactions without strong losses by inelastic collisions . " I never thought that we would so soon be in a regime where we need new many-body theory . " Radio-frequency spectroscopy <p> To detect the saturation of the mean-field energy in their degenerate Fermi gases , the Boulder and MIT teams introduced a new experimental technique : radio-frequency spectroscopy . That technique was used in a two-component Fermi gas  --  that is , a mixture of atoms with two different Zeeman spin states . For example , all the 40 K atoms in the Fermi gas used by Jin and her Boulder colleagues have total atomic spin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different Zeeman spin state , described by the quantum number m f . The Boulder group selects a mixture of two spin states , such as m f = - 9/2 and m f = - 7/2 . <p> With an RF pulse , one can transfer atoms between the two spin states , and the transition is detected as a narrow spectral line . The presence of atoms in a third spin state , however , can slightly change the energy difference between the original two spin states , shifting and broadening the RF transition between them . This effect is illustrated in figure 2a , from the experiment by Ketterle and his MIT group . The observed change in frequency is a measure of the system 's mean-field energy . <p> Figure 2b is a plot of the frequency shifts as a function of magnetic field . They are compared to a curve predicted by the theory of dilute atomic gases . Away from the Feshbach resonance , the data points line up along the curve . Within the resonance region , though , the measured shifts are much smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . Formation of ultracold molecules <p> For several years , experimental groups have used various techniques to coax ultracold atoms to pair as molecules ( see PHYSICS TODAY , September 2000 , page 46 ) . Until recently , most efforts began with bosonic atoms , some within BECs . Now , there 's great interest in forming molecules from fermions . In the process , atoms would move away from the governance by Fermi statistics to the rule of Bose statistics . <p> Regal , Jin , Christopher Ticknor , and John Bohn , all of the Boulder group , reported in July that they had formed molecules from atoms in two differing spin states. ( n8 ) The researchers started with a degenerate 40 K Fermi gas , consisting of atoms in the m f = - 9/2 and m f = - 5/2 states . They held these atoms at a magnetic field just above the Feshbach resonance , where the interactions are attractive . For this system , molecule formation is expected on the other side of the Feshbach resonance . The experimenters ramped down adiabatically through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden decrease in the number of atoms . This dip could mean that the atoms have entered molecules , but it might also mean that atoms have simply been lost from the trap . <p> To see if molecules had actually formed , Regal and her coworkers probed with an RF pulse . The frequency was set so that any molecule that might have formed would dissociate into m f = - 9/2 and m f = - 7/2 atoms . The presence of spin m f = - 7/2 atoms , which were not initially present , was thus the signal that molecules had been formed . As seen in figure 3 , such spin states did appear . <p> Since the Boulder paper appeared , a Rice University group ( n9 ) and the ENS-FOM-Kurchatov collaboration ( n10 ) have reported forming molecules from degenerate Fermi gases , and a team at the University of Innsbruck has described molecule production from an ultracold ( but not degenerate ) Fermi gas. ( n11 ) All three cite evidence that the molecules live for times on the order of at least one second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The longer lifetime means that the molecules can stick around long enough to form a BEC . Jin said that she and her coworkers are finding that the lifetime depends strongly on the magnetic field ; they too are now getting lifetimes approaching those in the other expriments . The experimental groups report conversion efficiencies  --  percentages of atoms that enter molecules  --  that range from 50 to 80% . <p> In the Rice experiment , Randall Hulet and his colleagues formed molecules from a degenerate Fermi gas of 6 Li atoms . Like the Boulder group , they ramped the magnetic field through a Feshbach resonance . To confirm formation of molecules , the researchers reversed the magnetic field ramp to return to the starting point ; the missing atoms resurfaced as the molecules dissociated . In the ENS-FOM-Kurchatov experiment , Salomon and his collaborators , also working with a degenerate 6 Li gas , were able to count the number of atoms that had not been bound in a molecular state ; they also showed that the atom-to-molecule process is reversible. ( n10 ) <p> The Innsbruck group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature where a degenerate Fermi gas forms , and the field was changed quickly rather than adiabatically . In contrast to the other experiments , the molecules in the Innsbruck case were formed by three-body collisions . The research team used a magnetic field gradient , as in a Stern  --  Gerlach experiment , to separate the atoms from molecules . The lifetime of the molecules was longer , perhaps because of the lower atomic density . Toward a superfluid ? <p> In their explorations of the strong-interaction regime , Thomas and his Duke colleagues found that their cloud of ultracold 6 Li atoms , after its release from the trap , expanded rapidly in the transverse direction and very little in the axial direction. ( n4 ) Such anisotropic expansion is a possible indication of superfluid hydrodynamics , which is collisionless . However , it can also be a sign of collisional hydrodynamics within the atomic cloud , as the Duke team and others have pointed out . <p> Superfluidity in a Fermi gas may reveal itself only through subtle signals . For all we know , several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how can it be detected ? Hulet suggests that proving the presence of superfluidity may take several pieces of evidence  --  perhaps the observation of a super-conductivity-like energy gap plus the sighting of resistance-free flow . <p> At the European Laboratory for Nonlinear Spectroscopy at the University of Florence , Massimo Inguscio and his colleagues are following a different strategy to reach fermionic superfluidity . They plan to use bosons as the glue for fermions , much as bosonic phonons help to couple the electrons in BCS superconductors . Inguscio 's group has found that a mixture of potassium-40 atoms ( fermions ) and rubidium-87 atoms ( bosons ) has a naturally strong and attractive interspecies interaction , which should favor the pairing of fermions even in the absence of an external magnetic field. ( n12 ) The researchers also note that they can further increase the natural interspecies interaction by using a magnetic field to approach a Feshbach resonance. ( n13 ) " We are also taking that approach , " says team member Giovanni Modugno , " to try to form a heteronuclear molecule , which should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the experimental groups are now planning how to conduct the hunt for a superfluid . They have caught a whiff of their prey and are on its trail . In the meantime , they are enjoying the hunt . <p> Figure 1 . A Feshbach resonance ( solid curve ) , seen here near 224 gauss , is signaled by the divergence of the scattering length a in units of the Bohr radius , a 0 . The curve is predicted by the theory of dilute gases . When a is smaller than the distance between atoms , one can write the mean-field energy as na , where n is the atom density . For larger a , the energy should approach a constant . The data points are values of a inferred from measurements of the mean-field energy in a degenerate Fermi gas of potassium-40 atoms . The points closest to resonance show a deviation from the theoretical curve . ( Adapted from ref. 5 . ) <p> Figure 2 .

( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and narrower when a third spin state is absent ( blue dots ) than when the third state is present ( green dots ) . The frequency shift is a measure of the shift in mean-field energy caused by the third atom . ( b ) Measured frequency shifts ( blue dots ) are much smaller near a Feshbach resonance ( dashed line ) than predicted by the theory of dilute atomic gases ( black curve ) .

( a ) At first , all atoms are in one of two spin states : m f = - 5/2 or m f = - 9/2. ( b ) After a magnetic field is ramped through a Feshbach resonance , atoms disappear from the two initial states because they are bound into molecules .
