From Dreamquake The stand of trees Laura had picked as a landmark was getting closer , but only very slowly . She sighed and picked up her pace . She was hungry , but that was no excuse for dragging her feet and daydreaming . A while later , when she 'd raised a sweat and her mind was just idling , the thought that had been trailing her for days - possibly since Rose first told her about the " surplus rails " - finally caught up with her . She remembered that the Grand Patriarch had asked her about the " Depot . " Laura raised her head and squinted up the line . The " Depot " was n't the name of a dream - it was a destination , where something was stored . What else had the Grand Patriarch said ? There was something else , a name from a rumor , because had n't the Grand Patriarch said that most of his intelligence came from rumors ? Contentment . Laura stopped walking when the word came into her head . She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkened around her as her pupils contracted . Dread had crept up and pounced on her . And , now that she was still , she understood that her footsteps had masked a vibration . A steely rolling was coming from the line behind her . Laura spun to face back along the line . She saw the handcar bearing down upon her , fast . Riding on it were six rangers .
