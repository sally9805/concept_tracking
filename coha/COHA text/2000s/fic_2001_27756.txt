I was not a political person . Despite the best efforts of someof my more militant friends , I managed to remain blissfully apoliticalfor the better part of my life . Of course , I 'd always exercisedmy patriotic duty and voted , but I left the actual activism to Peter , my husband , figuring that one soapbox in the family was enough . But it 's hard to remain politically neutral when you know asmany dykes as we do . Our friends Sheila and Jo were the ones whoapproached us about volunteering for Charles " Charlie " Clarke , who was one of the Democratic candidates for the senate seat thatwas being vacated by our retiring elder statesman . Clarke 's classicallyliberal views and his open support of gay rights had madehim the favorite son of the community , and galvanized theirefforts on his behalf . It also solidified the gay-baiting radicalright 's opposition to him . Both sides viewed Clarke 's run for officeas a call to arms . Sheila and Jo made it sound as if turning down the opportunity to serve Clarke would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a disciple . " Do you have any idea how important it is to get involved ? " Sheila had said passionately over dinner one night . " Do you haveany idea how many setbacks queers have suffered over the pastcouple of years ? " I inwardly rolled my eyes . In recent days Sheila had becomeone of those people who use the word queer for political empowermentwith an insistence that ends up making them sound likechildren who 've just learned a dirty word . " TheRepublicans want to take away all of our constitutionalrights , and the Religious Reich think it 's okay to kill us . We needpeople like Clarke in office . There 's important work to be done ? Peter had flashed his beautiful green eyes at me in a way thatsaid , " See ? I 've been telling you that for years . " At least he did n't sayit out loud . After a while my reluctance to get involved was overwhelmedby the Borgian pull of the entire gay community . Resistance wasfutile . I had to succumb . Which is why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's campaignheadquarters . The headquarters was located in a storefront on LincolnAvenue just north of Fullerton . It was crammed with foldingchairs and tables at which volunteers were engaged in a variety ofmenial tasks . The far end of the room was partitioned off as cubiclesfor our office manager and her assistant , and the back roomhad been turned into offices for the candidate and his campaignmanager to use whenever they were in town . It was n't a heavily funded campaign , but it was sincere . Thebelief that kept us going was that once Clarke won the Democraticnomination in the primary ( and we were given daily doses ofblind assurance that he would ) , there would be an infusion ofmoney into his campaign from the party , whether or not the partyactually liked him . Many of them did n't . Clarke had a reputationfor being straightforward , which could make even some membersof his own party quake in their boots . But personal feelings aside , they would throw their support to their most bitter enemy ratherthan relinquish the seat to a Republican . Peter volunteered when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freetime on his hands , " as Sheila had so quaintly put it . She didn'tknow just how accurate she was . Since taking up our occasionalwork with the CIA , I 'd let the business I 'd built up as a freelancegraphic artist dwindle down to one steady client , who I 'd kept onmore as a courtesy than anything else . But over the past year ourCIA assignments had also evaporated . I was n't hurting for moneyyet . I had a decent though not inexhaustible savings . And Motheralways told me that I did n't have to worry , because throughshrewd investments she had parlayed the considerable inheritancemy late father had left her into an even more considerable nestegg . But I could feel my genitals receding at the idea of being in mythirties and supported by my mother . At that point , I felt like stuffingenvelopes was about all I was good for . " Here 's some more " said Jody Linn-Hadden as she hoisted anenormous box of fliers onto the table where I was working . Our office manager had been born Jody Linn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanentpartnership with her familiar , Mary Hadden . I 've been told thatmeeting Mary had softened Jody , an idea that I find horrifyingbecause I had n't worked with Jody for an hour before I was thinkingof her as the Rosa Kleb of local politics . Only Jody was bigger.She was a huge Teutonic woman with long blond hair she woreviciously twisted into two braids , then rolled up and pinned toeach side of her head like a pair of unglazed cinnamon buns . Shemight not have physically resembled Kleb , but I still believed thatif she clicked her heels together a blade would pop out of her shoe . " You do n't look happy " she said , her lips forming a disapprovingtriangle . " I 'm fine . " She clucked her tongue . " You obviously do n't understand howimportant it is that we get Charlie Clarke elected .... " My brain reeled as Jody launched for the hundredth time intoa tirade about the ills of the world and the solutions that CharlieClarke had to offer . I 'm sure she was using actual words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of waterswirling down the drain . I drifted back into focus when it soundedas if she was wrapping it up . " ... so everything , no matter how insignificant it seems toyou , is important ! If just one person does n't get that flier , that maybe the one vote that decides this election . " " Yes , sir ! " I said , snapping a crisp salute . Jody pulled back slightly and scowled . I thought she might biteme , but instead she just shook her head with disgust and walkedaway . " Too intense for words , is n't she ? " said David Leech , the blue-eyednymphet who was working at the end of the table . " I wish " I replied . I spent the last hour answering phones , which I found onlyslightly less tedious than stuffing envelopes . It 's hard to believe that irate phone calls could become boring , but they did . " You tell that pansy-ass faggot-lover that if he gets elected , he'sa dead man ! " snarled one caller . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And can I give him yourname ? " Click . " Can you tell me , what is Mr. Clarke 's position on garbagecans ? " asked another caller , this time an elderly woman . " So far he has not positioned himself on garbage cans " Ireplied , casting aside the response sheet on which we were supposedto rely . " I 'm sure the minute he gets into office , he 'll be dealingwith your garbage . " Click . " I 've got it ! I 've got it ! " cried Shawn Stillman , one of the othervolunteers . He jumped up on his chair , put his hand over themouthpiece and merrily waved the receiver in the air . " It 's today'sbomb threat ! " The workers broke out in cheers and applauded . The officehad been receiving bomb threats for the past monthsome timesthree or four a day . To most of the volunteers it had almostbecome a game . We were thinking of holding an office pool , bettingon who could rack up the most threats in one week . " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aw , he hungup ! " He jumped down from the chair and replaced the receiver . Despite all the joking around about it , some of the volunteerswere worried about the threats . There was fear behind theirsmiles . In my own present frame of mind I felt that after defeatingevil foreign agents , crooked American agents , and crazed religiouszealots , it would probably be fitting if I was blown to bits whilestuffing envelopes . " It 's like I 've told all of you before , " Jody Linn-Haddenannounced in her booming voice , " these threats are a badge ofhonor ! A threat to Charlie Clarke and his campaign means thathe 's really making headway as we move toward the primary . Wehave victory in sight ! We 've got them scared and all they can do iscome back at us with cheap threats ! " She paused to punctuate thiswith a triumphant smile . " Now , pick up the pace , people ! We stillhave a lot of work to do ! " She clapped her hands together twice , then went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left , then got up and followed Jody , casually brushingthe sandy locks out of his eyes as he crossed the room . I 'd neverhad much in the way of dealings with him , but he struck me as thetype of person who believes the world is his Red Sea and it needsto part for him . " What do they do about the threats ? " asked David , who hadwandered over to the bank of phones during the hubbub . He wasa bit newer to The Cause than me and looked rightly confused bythe celebration surrounding the phone call . " They just log it and turn it over to the FBI . " His eyes widened . " That 's all ? " I shrugged . " We 're getting them every day . What more can wedo ? I 'm sure they follow them up . It 's easy enough for them to getphone records . " " But should n't somebody check the office for a bomb ? " " There 's no bomb here , " I said reassuringly . " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have sniffed it out . " He laughed without looking happy , then went back to hiswork before the commandant could catch him sloughing off . By five-thirty I was no longer listening to the callers at all.While they droned on I was mentally singing : Go down , Moses , way down to Egypt 's land Tell old Pharaoh , let my faggot go ... Moses finally arrived in the form of Peter Livesay , my husband , lover , and at that moment my liberator . He had fallen into thehabit of stopping in at campaign headquarters on his way homefrom Farrahut 's , the men 's clothing store at which he worked , andthen we 'd walk home together . It 's a testament to just how bored I was ( and how much I adorehim ) that when he appeared in the doorway he seemed to bebathed in a bright white light and float toward me in slow motionlike a blue-suited guardian angel . " Are you ready to go ? " he asked . " I assume that 's a rhetorical question , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket from the coat rack by the door . Idid n't wait to put it on before going out onto the street . " What 's your hurry ? " " No hurry , " I replied , slowing down . " I just feel like I 've beenlocked in a cage all day . " " Come on . It ca n't be as bad as all that " " That 's easy for you to say . You 've been helping young men inand out of their clothes . I 've been listening to the huddled massesyearning to spew anti-gay bile . " " Well , " he said with a heavy sigh , " it 's all in a good cause . " " Oh , please ! You 're not going to start telling me what a worthycandidate Charlie Clarke is , are you ? " " Well , he is a worthy candidate . " " I know , I know , I 've heard about it all dayagain ! Especiallyfrom Jody . That dyke is so damned political every time she opensher mouth I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter laid his hand gently on the small of my back . God , how Iloved his touch . " Honey , every day you sound more unhappy with this volunteergig . If it 's making you so miserable , why do n't you just stop it ? " I produced my most dramatic , world-weary sigh . " Becausegetting Charlie Clarke elected is really important to myself and tomy community " He laughed . " You do n't want people to know you actuallybelieve that , do you ? " " I do believe it " I replied with a smile . " That 's the trouble . " It was a nice walk down Fullerton to the town house we sharedwith my motheror rather , that she shared with us , since she wasthe owner . When we got there , we found her setting the table fordinner . " There are my darlings ! " she said , sweeping over to us and givingus each a peck on the cheek . " How was your day ? " " Not half as good as yours , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even for her . " Have you been in the cooking sherry ? " " Not at all ! " she said as she breezed into the kitchen . Peter andI followed her . She was humming a tune as she stirred a pot ofboiling potatoes . " Mother , the table 's only set for two . " " I know . I wo n't be joining you . I 've got a date " " You what ? " The words popped out of my mouth before I wasable to eliminate the tone of shock . " You need n't sound so surprised " she said , shooting a comicsquint at me over her shoulder . " Rumor has it that I 'm notdeformed " " I did n't mean that . I just did n't know you were seeing anyone " " I was n't . I went downtown to shop today and I ran into himat Marshall Field 's " " At Field 's ? " said Peter . " Are you sure he 's straight ? " " Do n't be daft , darling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or whatever they call it nowadays . And there he was , completelyup a tree , trying to choose a scarf to take home to hismother . " " How sweet " I intoned . " Yes ! Simonthat 's his name , Simonis from England ! Hewas born in the north country , but he spent most of his life inLondon . He 's here doing some sort of business . I helped him pickout a scarf , a nice deep blue one with a muted paisley printit'sreally , really lovelyand he was so grateful for the help he askedme out to dinner . " She turned back to the stove and resumed stirringthe potatoes . " Do you mean to tell me you allowed yourself to be picked upin a department store ? " " Yes ! " she exclaimed with delight . " And you 're going out to dinner with him ? Are you crazy ? Youhardly know anything about him ! He could be an axe murderer ! " " Darling , he 's British . " " So was Crippen ! " " Gawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . " Simon wasa proper gentleman . He 's ever so nice . " " Gawn ? " I turned to Peter " I do n't believe this ! Ten minuteswith another Englishman and she turns into Eliza Doolittle ! " " Well , I think it 's great " said Peter . " But you did n't need tocook dinner for us . We could 've fended for ourselves . " " Nonsense ! I enjoy doing it . But if you would n't mind , I wouldappreciate it if you 'd finish it up so I can get ready for my date . Heshould be here soon . Now , there 's a lovely bit of beef in the oven , and it should come out in about twenty minutes . The potatoes willbe done about the same time . There are salads in the refrigerator " She bustled toward the doorway , pausing just long enough topinch my cheek . " Do try not to look quite so much like a blowfish , dear " With this she scurried through the house and up the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said once she was gone . " I spend all daybeing brow beaten by the Beast of Belsen , and Mother 's datingJack the Ripper " " She 's a level-headed woman . You do n't have anything toworry about . " I looked at him as if he 'd lost his mind . " This is my motherwe 're talking about , right ? The woman who once set fire to abuilding that we were in to try to rescue us ? " He shrugged . " It worked . " I looked heavenward for help . " That was only one example ofher little antics ! Do you want to hear the whole list ? " Peter stared at me in silence . " Honey , what 's wrong ? " " Nothing ! " " Of course there is . You know your mother can take care ofherself . What 's going on with you ? You seem so unhappy lately . Ido n't mean just about your mother and this volunteer thing.There must be more to it . " There 's something inherently comforting about being knowntoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thateven at the worst of times can make you feel that everything willbe all right . I suddenly felt like crying , and Peter must 've sensed it , because he slipped his arms around me . I buried my face in hisshoulder . " I feel so worthless ! " " Why ? " he said , stroking my hair . " I 've practically ruined my business .... " " No you have n't " " Yes I have . And it 's my own damn fault ! " " That 's silly " he said quietly . " You could build it back up in aminute if you wanted to , and you know it . You 're a damn goodartist . That ca n't be all that 's bothering you . " I swallowed . " We have n't heard from Nelson for months . " Agent Lawrence Nelson was our boss from the CIA on ouroccasional forays into the world of espionage . " I see , " Peter said with a smile in his voice . " You know , I 'd hateto think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourlives have been in danger . " I laughed halfheartedly . " You do n't understand . You 're gone allday . You have something to do . I 'm just sitting around here like aworthless lump of nothing waiting for the phone to ring . " " So all of this is work-related ? " " I guess . I feel like a housewife who 's been told all she 's goodfor is volunteer work . Nobody needs me . " Peter pushed me back slightly so that he could look into myeyes . " I need you . " The sincerity with which he said this knocked a couple of pegsout of my self-pity . " No , you do n't , " I replied , hoping he 'd say it again . " Oh , yes I do . " He gathered me back into his arms . " If youwere n't around , I do n't think I could go on living . You 're whatkeeps my heart beating . " I pulled back and looked at him . The corner of my mouthcurled . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He laughed . " That does n't make it any less true . " Our lips came together and for a few moments all of the caresI 'd been feeling disappeared . We were interrupted when Mothercalled from the top of the stairs : " Alex ! I think I smell something burning " " Do n't worry , Mother , " I called back . " It 's just me ! " The lovely bit of beef Mother planned for our dinner did get a littlesinged while Peter and I engaged in a spontaneous spot ofnecking . But when we got around to having dinner , it was prettygood nonetheless . We were clearing the table when the doorbellrang . " Would you get that , darling ? " Mother 's voice floated downfrom the second floor . " I 'm not quite ready yet . " I opened the door and was faced with an absolutely strikingman of around my mother 's age . His hair was jet black and fleckedwith bluish gray at the temples . His skin was rather light , and hiseyes were light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said in a deep , pleasing voice . " My name is SimonTivoli . Does Jean Reynolds live here ? " " Yes , " I replied . " Please , come in . Mother will be down in aminute . I 'm Alex , her son . " He stepped in and I closed the door behind him . " I 'm very pleased to meet you , ' he said as he reached out andgave me a firm handshake . When I disengaged myself , I said , " And this is my husband , Peter . " Tivoli reached for Peter 's hand , but stopped short . " Oh ? Oh ! " He smiled broadly and gave Peter 's hand a hearty shake . " Youmust forgive me if I sounded surprised . Your mother did n't mentionthat you were a Nancy boy . " " It seldom comes up at the first meeting " I replied . " Oh ! I 'm so sorry ! " He looked properly abashed . " I 've reallyput my foot in it . My dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely . I 've never thought much about it . It is a term you fellowsfind offensive ? " " Only when it 's preceded by kill the fucking ' " said Peter . Without a hint of sarcasm , Tivoli said , " You 're really very gracious.This is my first visit to the States , you know , and ever sinceI arrived I 've felt rather like I 'm tripping over myself . D' you knowwhat I mean ? " " Yes " I said . " How long will you be in town ? " " About a fortnight , altogether " he replied amiably . " I'vealready been a week . My company sent me over . " " What company would that be ? " Peter applied some not too gentle pressure to my left shoulderblade . " Oh , it 's just a computer company . Nothing you 'd ever haveheard of . The main office is in London , and they 've sent me hereto the American branch for some seminars . " " Sounds interesting . " " ' Tis n't really " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it got mea trip to a place I 've never seen . The only thing really interestingthat 's happened to me so far was meeting your mum . It 's ratherlonely , you know , being in a country where you do n't know anybody.It was awfully nice to run into someone from England . Itmade me feel right at home . " " Is that you , Simon ? " said Mother as she came down the stairs . She was wearing a long pearl dress with a white , loose-knitshawl wrapped around her shoulders . She did n't exactly lookdressed for the ball , but with her natural beauty and bearing , shehad about the same effect as the transformed Audrey Hepburndescending the staircase in My Fair Lady . " It 's so nice to see you again , " she said , extending her hand . Helifted it to his lips and kissed it lightly . " I suddenly feel like her wicked stepsister , " I whispered toPeter , who responded by jabbing his elbow into my ribs . " I 've made reservations at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about it , but one of the fellows at mycompany says that it 's very good . " " I 'm sure it will be lovely " " Do n't you mean loverly ? " I said under my breath . Peter gaveme another jab . Tivoli turned to Peter and me . " You 'll excuse us , wo n't you ? Wedo n't want to be late . " He smoothly maneuvered Mother to the door , where shepaused long enough to say , " Have a nice evening , boys " As the door closed , she added , " Do n't wait up . " After a lengthy silence , Peter said , " Well , he seems niceenough . " " Yes , he does , " I replied . " I hate him . " I did n't purposely wait up for MotherI was kept awake by thesausage-curled , pasty-faced image of Bette Davis standing beside the bed , staring down at me with a bright red smile painted on herface and saying , " Butcha are a failure , Blanche ! Ya ' are ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mywakefulness . He rolled over on his side and stretched a comfortingarm across my chest . Tears formed in my eyes . He had told me thathe needed me , which did make me feel better ( even though I'dalready known it ) , but at the same time it added a little pressure.There 's nothing like being deeply in love for making you want tosucceed in life , not just for yourself but for your spouse . It wasn'tso much that I wanted Peter to be proud of me he already was . Itwas that I wanted his pride to be justified . It seemed like I 'd been lying awake in the dark for several yearsbefore I finally heard the sound of the front door opening andclosing . I glanced at the clock on our bedside table . It was 1:57 . There was a jaunty quality in Mother 's step as she came up thestairs , and she was humming when she passed our door . So she'dhad a good time . I knew if I contemplated how much of a goodtime I 'd never get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd arrived home safe and sound , and cast aside any questionof why a simple dinner at a French restaurant had taken oversix hours .
