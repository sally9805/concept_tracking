Google Earth and its rival programs offer ( civilians ) a new way to look at the world // A best I can figure , I have spent 35,000 to 40,000 hours of my life sitting at a computer . This knowledge does not improve my mood or self-esteem . But it brings into sharp relief the handful of moments at the keyboard I can distinctly remember , each involving a time when I realized that the computer had just done something important and new . In the late 1970s , I marveled at the discovery that I could use my very first computer ( a Processor Technology SOL-20 ) to save something I had drafted , then change it later on without having to retype the whole thing . In the early 1980s , I watched a message I had written go to its destination electronically , through a 300-baud modem I clamped onto a telephone handset . In 1993 , I tried a program called Mosaic , one of the very first browsers , and was amazed to see pictures and documents stored on someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 , I entered a few words into a search box and within seconds got back some more-or-less relevant information , via the early search engine AltaVista. // The Caltrans overlay for Google Earth shows current traffic conditions // That was it for truly memorable moments , until last year when I first tried Google Earth . The addictive nature of this program stems from three elements . One is a set of satellite and aerial photos of the globe 's entire surface , which Google has acquired from a variety of public and private sources . These vary greatly in resolution , but the sharp ones , which already cover most major populated areas and are steadily expanding in range , are unnervingly clear . I now take it for granted that I can pick out every building-homes , schools , offices-I care about in the United States . But I can also see the tiny house where my family lived outside Tokyo , complete with ten-foot-square " back yard , " and the red-roofed colonial bungalow we rented in Kuala Lumpur , which now sits in the shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings . The village where my wife and I once worked in Ghana , on the other hand , is just a green blur . The next element is Google Earth 's viewing system , which lets you " fly " from point to point . This sounds trivial , but I think it can profoundly reorient people 's sense of geography . We are used to thinking of places as being arrayed along roads or rail lines , or linked by airline routes . Taking a Google Earth " flight " is like driving through a city you knew only through subways , and seeing the surprising ways the pieces fit together . Finally , the program has an imperfect but tantalizing 3D feature . The contours of terrain and , in certain cities , the heights of downtown structures are built into the database . Although the program 's standard view is straight down from overhead , you can tilt the perspective , until you 're looking from a low altitude or even ground level . This gives a dramatic sense of how , say , a ski resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greenland would look if you approached from the sea . You ca n't count on the program to have enough accurate data to make this feature work everyplace-those Petronas Towers , when seen at a tilt , look no taller than my former house-but where it works it 's great . The basic version of the program , which does everything described in this article , is free ( it requires a broadband connection ) . For now , it runs only on PCs , but its creator , John Hanke , says that a Mac version is about to appear . Hanke and others developed the program at a small company called Keyhole , which Google bought two years ago . ( Microsoft has released its counterpart program , Virtual Earth , at its Windows Live site , http : //local.live.com . This program does n't have the flying or 3D features of Google Earth , but it does have superior close-up shots of many U.S. cities , including " bird's-eye " views of about a dozen cities so breathtakingly detailed that in some cases you can see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some structures that have been blurred out of Google Earth-for instance , the vice president 's home in Washington. ) // Blogwise.com tells who is writing a blog in your neighborhood // Together these elements make Google Earth fascinating . What makes the program important is the trait it shares with other big steps forward in computing , like the previous ones I recall so sharply . It is not an end in itself but a beginning of new opportunities for innovation by others , based on the new tools it provides . A huge theme in recent discussions of the Internet 's future is the growing importance of " user-created content . " In the old-media days of the twentieth century , small groups of specialists produced books , newspapers , or broadcasts that larger public audiences could consume . Now millions of people publish their views over the Internet , by producing blogs , or rating products or services online , or posting pictures and Webcasts for others to view , or creating networks of like-minded people who can share recommendations about vacation sites or bikes or restaurants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user-created content , if you prefer-are many and varied . But they rest upon the fundamental units of all modern Internet activity : URLs , links , and words . A URL ( uniform resource locator ) directs a browser to a particular set of files on a particular computer somewhere on Earth ( each Web " page " is really a collection of files ) . Links take users from one set of files to another . The words in a file , indexed by search engines or catalogued as " tags , " serve as a guide to Web page content . Google Earth of course employs links and URLs . Its basic unit of classification , however , is not a word but a set of global positioning system ( GPS ) coordinates , pinpointing a location on the Earth with uncanny precision . The Google Earth view of my neighborhood in Washington shows a red truck parked down the street . The front bumper of that truck has a different GPS address from the windshield . And in the same way that a " traditional " blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links pointing to a particular news item or posting , Google Earth allows the equivalent of bloggers to attach annotations to specific geographical points . These overlays consist of pictures , written descriptions , Internet links , or other data tied to the GPS coordinates of a particular place . When a Google Earth user zooms in on that place , the link to the information appears , usually as a clickable icon or button . Since last June , when Google released the program and its toolkit for creating these overlays , many people have gotten to work . As with online book reviews at Amazon.com or entries on Wikipedia ( the online encyclopedia in which anyone can write or edit an entry ) , the information supplied can range from authoritative to bogus . But nearly all of it is interesting . The easiest way to see what 's on offer is through sites like Ogleearth. com and Gearthblog.com . They have news and screenshots , and links to files that create the overlays for Google Earth . You click to download overlays to your computer . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want displayed . John Hanke of Google showed me a few examples , which ranged from the fanciful to the highly practical . On the practical side is an overlay from Caltrans , the agency responsible for California 's freeways . When you display this data within Google Earth , it shows congestion conditions every mile or so along freeways in the state 's major cities . Clusters of red , orange , yellow , or green dots show you where traffic is moving and where it is jammed ; any dot you click on tells the average speed of cars passing that point . A WiFi overlay shows the nearest available commercial hot spots . On a skiing overlay , you can click a blue snowflake symbol by major resorts and get detailed slope information and a link to the mountain 's Web site . An aviation site called FBOWeb.com offers a free demonstration showing the trajectories airliners are taking toward several major airports ; by using the tilted view you can " watch " planes as they descend over Boston Harbor or through the Los Angeles basin for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlays as you choose , clicking on a check box to turn them on or off . // South 3.1 chronicles Ernest Shackleton 's doomed Endurance mission // Less practical , but often more delightful , creations continue to proliferate . An overlay from Blogwise. com shows who is writing a blog in your city-or in Buenos Aires or Beijing-with a link to each blog . Another shows bird migration patterns . One called South 3.1 shows the route of Ernest Shackleton 's doomed Endurance mission to Antarctica , with photos and log entries matched to their locations . Another , covering the Mount Everest area , maps the course of a 2003 Everest expedition with aerial photos so sharp you can see individual tents . The Google Earth Community overlay has Wikipedia-style notes on interesting buildings and historic sites . Perhaps the most open-ended potential involves Google Earth 's interaction with Flickr , the photo-sharing site run by Yahoo . More than 75 million photos have been stored at Flickr , many of them tagged by location- " Paris , Arc de Triomphe " - or " geotagged " with GPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handy way to store files that can clog hard drives and to keep them all in one place ; viewing access is generally free . Using the Flickr overlay , which works through a site called Geobloggers , you can see any available photos of the place you 're looking at . For instance , when displayed in addition to the Everest overlay , Flickr brings up pictures people have taken at the summit . When I 'm looking at my neighborhood , I see Flickr photos of trees that were blown down two years ago in a hurricane . New shots pour into Flickr each day , and to similar sites like Panoramio. com , founded by two young Spaniards , which lets users easily link their photos to specific sites . Google Earth is far less powerful than " geographic information systems , " or GIS . These are complex and often expensive programs that match economic , demographic , environmental , and other data to satellite views of particular locations . A county government might use GIS to combine data on population density , fire risks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firehouse . Businesses use it to decide where to place distribution centers or new stores . Scientists use it to track environmental trends . But according to Jack Dangermond , founder and president of the world 's leading GIS company , ESRI of Redlands , California , the free services available under Google Earth will increase the public 's use of geographically linked information , for-pay and free alike . " There 's no way to connect a professional data set to Google Earth , so in a sense it is pretty thin , " he said . " But because it is spellbinding to customers , it can only build awareness of geography . And if this exposure makes citizens more spatially literate , they can accept more of their information this way and visualize more about their local situations . " Many governments already use GIS to let citizens see public data , from the residences of registered sex offenders to the tax assessments of buildings , homes , and lots . Within a year or two , he said , standard Web browsers will allow citizens to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using features like Google Earth 's . " Honestly , I have no idea where this is going in the long run , " John Hanke of Google told me . " Ten years ago , this technology was the exclusive province of the U.S. intelligence community . Five years ago , it cost $14,000 for a single satellite image . Now there 's free , global high-resolution imagery . " The most significant use of the technology so far , he said , has been to provide " maps for places where they had no previous maps . " He read from a newspaper story about the headman of a Kurdish village who was using a Google Earth printout to plan the village 's rebuilding . " This is really inspiring to me , " Hanke said . " It 's the sort of thing that we thought might happen as this information is released and democratized . " Fooling around with this program and its overlays has put a few more hours on my computer total . These hours seem better spent than most .
