December 1959 <p> Sheriff Ed Beedles grabbed the barrel of his shotgun , yanking it from the rack in his patrol car . He knew Charlie Brennan well enough to know better , but there he was , standing in front of his brother 's farmhouse not fifty feet in front of him , covered in blood , one arm wrapped over his ten-year-old niece , Maggie , clutching her like she was a hostage , the girl wearing nothing but a nightgown , shivering in the cold . The dispatcher had taken Charlie 's call thirty minutes ago , Charlie screaming at her that Sam and Gretchen were dead and that he had Maggie . <p> The Brennan place was twenty miles south of the sheriff 's headquarters in the Johnson County courthouse in Olathe . He 'd made good time , taking advantage of the new highway , Interstate 35 , that had opened earlier in the year , making it to Spring Hill in twenty minutes , then heading west and busting it over the last few miles of rough county road . He fishtailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spitting gravel and ice laid down in last week 's storm , siren blaring , his heart riding in his throat the last quarter mile to the farmhouse . He was first on the scene , his deputy Tom Goodell , and two ambulances five minutes behind . <p> It had been three weeks since the Clutter family had been slaughtered in their farmhouse near Holcomb . That was a good four hundred miles west , but there had been no arrests and every lawman in the state was on edge , scared the killers would strike again . <p> Still , Beedles knew it was more likely that Charlie had killed his brother and sister-in-law than some faceless maniacs , most murders being committed by people who knew their victims . He 'd heard talk of trouble between the brothers , something about the land their parents left them , but as far as he knew , it was just talk . <p> He opened his car door and stepped out , keeping the door between him and Charlie , the shotgun invisible at his side . The farmhouse sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind by stands of maples and oaks . It had been daylight for an hour , the sky heavy and close with leaden clouds , the wind cold and stiff enough to make a man deaf . <p> " Let her go , Charlie , " Beedles shouted . <p> " They 're dead ! Both of them . " A rose mist floated off of Charlie , fresh blood mixing with the frozen air . <p> " Then we ca n't do anything for them but we can take care of Maggie . Now let her go . " <p> Beedles did n't see a weapon in either of Charlie 's hands but that did n't mean he was innocent or unarmed . He could be both and also be unhinged by what he 'd seen , making him dangerous in another way . <p> Beedles started a slow walk toward Charlie and Maggie , keeping the shotgun aimed at the ground . His deputy and the ambulances would come storming into the yard any second , no way to tell how Charlie would react to the added commotion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tightening his grip on the girl . " They 're dead ! Cut to pieces ! " <p> " And that 's a terrible thing . Let 's not make it any worse . " <p> Beedles closed the distance between them , leveling the shotgun at Charlie . Though he could n't shoot Charlie without shredding Maggie with buckshot , he knew the sight of that gun pointed at Charlie could n't help but make him focus on his mortality . <p> Charlie stared at the shotgun . " Ed , you do n't think I killed them , do you ? " <p> They were ten feet apart . Charlie 's hands , arms , and chest were soaked in blood . Maggie 's face was streaked with crimson , honey-colored bangs falling over her eyes , her lips blue , her nightgown blood splattered . Beedles stepped closer , raising the shotgun at Charlie 's face ; Charlie 's eyes opened wide like day lilies under the sun . <p> " I do n't think anything , Charlie . I just want to have a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can talk about what happened . That be all right with you ? " <p> Deputy Goodell 's cruiser skidded to a stop , flanking Beedles , Charlie , and the girl . Using his open car door for cover , he drew his handgun , taking a two-fisted aim at Charlie Brennan . <p> " We okay , here , Sheriff ? " Goodell asked . <p> " How about it , Charlie , we okay ? " Beedles asked . <p> Charlie hung his head . " Yeah , we 're okay . " <p> Beedles lowered his shotgun , reaching for Maggie with his free hand . " Come here , sweetheart , " he said . <p> Maggie slipped out from under Charlie 's arm and put her hand in his . Beedles squeezed her hand and she squeezed his , surprising Beedles with her calm strength , as if the blood on her fingers was nail polish . <p> Over the next hours and days , Charlie Brennan told his story again and again to Sheriff Beedles , the district attorney , the polygraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sentence , or paragraph . He and his brother had put their hard feelings behind . He 'd come to pick up his brother so they could repair a bad stretch of fence they shared . No one answered when he rang the bell . The door was unlocked so he went in and called out for Sam and Gretchen . When they did n't respond , he went looking and found them stabbed to death in their bed . He got their blood on him when he cradled their bodies in his arms , going crazy at the sight of them . He found Maggie hiding in the bushes beneath her second floor bedroom . The polygraph examiner said that Charlie was truthful in all measures and no charges were filed against him . <p> Maggie Brennan 's story corroborated her uncle . She said that she was awakened by cries coming from her parents ' bedroom . Then she heard footsteps coming toward her bedroom . It was dark . Someone grabbed her but his hands were too wet and slippery with blood to hold her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jumping over the rail , her only injury a sprained ankle . She ran into a nearby field , staying there house , remaining there until her uncle found her . She spoke without tears ; a doctor who examined her explained that she was too shocked to cry , assuring Beedles that it was best if she buried the memories of that night . <p> Beedles walked through the Brennan farmhouse dozens of times , re-creating the killer 's path , tracing the blood trail from Sam and Gretchen 's bedroom to Maggie 's . He opened the French doors onto her balcony , stood at the rail , and marveled at the courage of a ten-year-old girl to escape from the killer and jump from such a height . <p> Charlie Brennan sent Maggie to live with his sister in California . He never set foot on his brother 's farm again , selling it in the spring and sending the money to his sister to pay for Maggie 's upbringing . That night , he got drunk and was killed when he drove his pickup truck into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith were arrested for the Clutter family murders , Beedles drove to Garden City to question them . They denied the killings and there was no evidence to link them to the Brennan case . <p> No murder weapon was ever found . No one was ever charged with the murders of Sam and Gretchen Brennan . It was n't the only unsolved crime during Beedles 's years as sheriff but it was the one that woke him up at night until the day he died . <p> Chapter Two January 2009 <p> Maggie Brennan had been waiting to die for fifty years so when the lights went out while she was working late at night and the bell hanging on a hook above the front door jingled as it opened and slammed shut , loosing icy winter wind into the farmhouse , and heavy , steady footsteps trudged up the stairs toward her bedroom , she did n't call 911 , cry out , or grab a letter opener to defend herself . <p> She 'd dreamed of this moment often . The image of the killer was as hazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , painting her cheeks with her parents ' blood before she hurled herself off the balcony outside her bedroom , the killer never caught , never forgotten . <p> Her work as a neuroscientist researching the toll of trauma on the brain was a constant reminder of that night . Her nightmares affirmed her unspeakable certainty that she would leave this life the same way as had her parents . <p> She rose from her chair , her voice quiet and calm when her killer appeared in the doorway . " What took you so long ? " she asked . <p> French doors opened behind her onto the balcony , the frozen earth two stories beneath sloping away from the house , rough and rocky . She swung the doors wide , stepping onto the balcony , her feet bare , frigid air rippling through her thin nightgown , pickling her skin . Branches of an oak tree just beyond her reach swayed in the starless night , the eaves above her whining , complaining of the cold . <p> Her back was to the bedroom . She felt him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then felt a hand slide down the length of her neck , settling into the base of her spine , the push firm as she went over the rail and the unforgiving ground rushed to meet her . <p> She awoke , as she always did , the instant before impact , her mouth coated with bile . Why , she wondered , was it so easy to kill and so hard to die . <p> Chapter Three " Jack , this job is perfect for you . " <p> " I have n't had a perfect job since Sue Ellen Erickson asked me to carry her books home in the fifth grade . " <p> Simon Alexander and I were having coffee late Friday afternoon on the Country Club Plaza , the gray day giving way to full night , snow coming down sideways . The after-Christmas sales were over and the quarter million multicolored lights that turned the Plaza 's shops and restaurants into Disneyland from Thanksgiving through mid-January had gone dark . The sidewalks were empty . People with sense were home or on their way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much time as you want , take a break whenever you need to , you know ... " <p> " Stop shaking . " <p> " Yeah , that . " <p> The FBI had retired me at age fifty because of a movement disorder that makes me shake , sometimes bending me in half , sometimes strangling my speech , sometimes leaving me the hell alone . The cause and the cure are both mysteries , the symptoms a capricious mix of hiccups and hammer blows . The more I do , the more I shake but a friend once told me that the more you do , the more you do . So I put as much into my days as I can , accepting that it will rattle my cage . Some days are diamonds and some days are stones . <p> Simon was in the technology security business . He called me when his clients ' problems got more complicated than a string of ones and zeros . <p> " I keep telling you , Simon , you do n't have to dance around it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A flurry of mild tremors stutter-stepped my automatic denial . " Tell me about the job . " <p> " You 've heard of Milo Harper ? " <p> " Kansas City 's hometown billionaire . He offered Kate Scranton a job but she turned him down , says she does n't trust him . " <p> " She 'd do better reading astrology charts than her facial action coding system . If someone winks when they should blink , she thinks they 're guilty of something they have n't even thought of doing . " <p> " Trouble is , she 's usually right . What else should I know about Harper ? " <p> " We grew up together and were roommates at Stanford . He dropped out during our sophomore year . I stayed and got my degree while he left and got rich . Created one of those social networking sites and sold it for a couple of billion . I 've done some work for him since he came back to Kansas City . " <p> " You and a billionaire ? I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the tall , good-looking guy with wavy hair , a square chin , and pecs he could make dance . I was the short nebbish geek with early male pattern baldness whose idea of a good pickup line was would you like to play Simon says . " <p> " How 'd that work out for you ? " <p> " It was the ones who said yes that scared me . " <p> " Harper plowed a bunch of the money into that place ... what 's it called ? " <p> " The Harper Institute of the Mind . " <p> " He keeps trying to recruit Kate . She keeps telling him no but he keeps asking . " <p> " That 's Milo . He can charm you if he wants to but he does n't care what you think about him as long as you 've got talent . And he does n't take no for an answer . He says the brain is the last frontier . He 's recruited some of the top people in the field , except , apparently , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? Is he short on guinea pigs ? " <p> " No , but I told him you were available in case the lab rats got a better offer . " <p> " Nice . Then what is it ? " <p> " He 's worried about one of his projects , something having to do with dreams . " <p> " Who 's having nightmares ? " <p> " He is . Two of the volunteers participating in the project have died in the last month . According to the cops , one death was accidental and one was suicide . " <p> " Bad luck , but what 's that got to do with Harper and his institute ? " <p> " Hopefully nothing , but the families have hired a lawyer named Jason Bolt who has sent Milo the proverbial **40;455;TOOLONG letter . He wants someone to take another look . I suggested you . " <p> I 'd heard of Bolt . He 'd made a fortune taking down corporations for everything from defective products to defrauding shareholders . He was one of a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reputation . <p> " A billionaire takes your advice ? " <p> Simon laughed . " I was the one who told him to quit school . " <p> " What else did he tell you ? Why does Bolt think these deaths could be tied to the institute ? " <p> " I 'm Milo 's friend , not his priest . He does n't tell me everything . He asked me for a name and I gave him yours . " <p> " You know him . What 's your sense of this ? " <p> " Milo is a passionate guy . He loves the institute . The look in his eyes , the way he talks about it , you 'd think it was his child , like the walls were papered with his DNA . When he called me , he sounded like a parent whose kid had gone missing . " <p> I knew that fear , how it leeches into your bones , like poison with an eternal half-life . But the Harper Institute of the Mind did n't have dimples , skinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and break your heart at the same time . It was bricks , mortar , and money . <p> " Is he married ? Does he have kids ? " <p> " Neither . He 's married to the job . His first kid was the business he built and sold . Now he has the institute . It 's not an accident that the abbreviation for Harper Institute of the Mind is HIM . " <p> My doctor told me that the only way I could control the shakes was to change my lifestyle , to slow down . That was fourteen months ago and I still had n't found the sweet spot between alive and dead . The work Simon sent me tilted the scale toward alive but sometimes it 's better to let the scale swing the other way . Rich people who substitute the things they build , create , and run for the relationships they never had can be more irrational than any overprotective parent . <p> " I think I 'll pass . " <p> " Why ? Because of Kate Scranton ? Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight . I 'm surprised there were any survivors . " <p> I laughed . " We 're a work in progress . I 'm having dinner with her tomorrow night . The problem is that she sees things in me that I do n't always want her to see . " <p> " The micro-expressions that she claims give away your secrets ? " <p> " Yeah . It 's how her brain is wired . Sometimes I do n't handle it very well but I still respect her judgment . Plus , rich guys like Harper who think they can buy people the same way they buy buildings can get crazy when things do n't go their way and I do n't do crazy . " <p> " At least talk to him . I told him that you would call him tonight . All you have to do is check out this dream project and he 'll take it from there . " <p> " I load the gun and he pulls the trigger . " <p> " Just like when you were at the FBI and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-age angst ? You 've spent your whole life going after bad guys . " <p> " I always knew whose side I was on and I was a lot better at figuring out the truth . Those lines are n't as bright when a billionaire draws them . " <p> " There was a philosopher who claimed that it was impossible to determine whether some things are true or false . He proved it by saying that all men are liars . If he was telling the truth , then he was a liar . " <p> " Yeah , but that does n't make not knowing any easier . " <p> Simon took a breath , leaning toward me . " This is n't about Wendy . " <p> Wendy was my daughter . She died early last year , twenty-plus years after her brother Kevin was murdered by a sex offender masquerading as a trustworthy neighbor . Every FBI agent in the Kansas City office attended the funeral , some out of respect , others because Wendy had been a fugitive , the last suspected member of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked me to the curb , the only loose end being five million dollars that had disappeared into the ether . They were convinced she stole the money . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
