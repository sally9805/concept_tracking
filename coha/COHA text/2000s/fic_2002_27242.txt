Rebecca finally finished painting the in-law apartment on a Friday night , and on Saturday morning she rented it to some poor guy who had just left a monastery . The ad had not even appeared in the papers yet , but she had tucked a tiny Apt. for Rent sign in the front window and he just wandered by and rang the bell . His name was Michael Christopher . He was a lanky man in his early forties , a little Lincolnesque , with rounded shoulders and a long , sad face muffled by a beard in need of trimming . His hands were too big for his arms and his feet were too big for his legs . His hair was cropped close , the merest new dark stubble on a skull that had obviously been kept shorn until recently . The in-law apartment 's ceiling was low and he kept his head ducked a little , whether from fear of smacking it or out of some deeper humility , Rebecca could not tell . It was her impression that he was in no danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunch was meekness . He wore plain black trousers , rather rumpled , a shirt that had once been white but had yellowed remarkably , a black jacket with the shoulder seam split , and some white , high-top Converse sneakers from the era before athletic shoes made statements . After twenty years of living a monk 's life , he could fit all his other possessions into a comically small black satchel . It looked like a doctor 's bag . " Why did you leave the monastery ? " she asked him . He shrugged . " I had a fight with my abbot . Among other things . " " A fight ? " He smiled , a little wearily . " To put it in layman 's terms . " Rebecca laughed . " Well , that 's not very Christian , is it ? " " It 's sort of a long story . " Christopher hesitated . " I was fed up with that place anyway , to tell you the truth . I had prayed myself into a hole . " The evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She liked his smile and his unguarded brown eyes . He had no credit history at all , of course . He did n't even have a driver 's license . He had a check , some kind of severance pay  --  did contemplatives get severance pay ?  --  that he had n't been able to get cashed . He had no job as yet . As far as she could determine he had no prospects , no plan , and no rsum . But there was something about him that she liked a lot , a gloomy depth . And there was the appeal of the quixotic . He had devoted his adult life to the contemplation of God . That was his rsum . He had done what she had always intended to do with her own life and flung it into the maw of Meaning in one grand , futile gesture , and he had nothing to show for it but the clothes on his back . He 'd been sleeping in the park and he had n't eaten in three days , but he seemed unperturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The apartment showed fast . A bathroom , a minute , stoveless kitchen with a half-fridge on one counter and a hot plate on the other , and the single real room in the place , an 8 x 15 box carpeted in a brown that had not seemed so dishearteningly the color of mud in the samples . The walls , at least , were a fresh cream . Rebecca was proud of her paint job . The room 's lone window opened into the barren backyard . Christopher went right to the glass and stood looking out at the weedy waste . Rebecca could feel his melancholy . It was not much of a prospect . " I keep meaning to put in a garden back there , " she said . " Or something . But there 's never any time , it seems . And when there 's time , I just want to recover . " " I 'd be glad to do some work back there myself . It 's a nice space . " " Ah , well --  " Rebecca murmured , flustered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange . " If I could afford a gardener ... " His look was genuinely uncomprehending ; it had not occurred to him to charge her . Well , that was very New Testament too , of course . But mortgages were Old Testament , and hers was about to balloon . She had been hoping to rent the apartment to a quiet spinster with an obvious income , not a down-and-out man of God . As they stood there , she clearly heard his stomach growl . Their eyes met . His look was apologetic , with a trace of dry amusement ; he had lovely warm brown eyes . Rebecca took him upstairs , gave him a bowl of Cheerios , and introduced him to her daughter . At six years old , Mary Martha was an infallible detector of bullshit . Christopher was immediately easy with the child in an unflamboyant way . So many adults just turned up the volume , as if a kid could n't hear . But Christopher got quietly attentive , like a shy child himself . The two of them sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the back of the box together . Mary Martha soon was chattering away , and when she invited Christopher to see her unicorns , Rebecca took it as a sign and let him have the apartment . She was tempted to renege the next day . The deluge of applicants responding to the newspaper ad included a number of solid citizens . But by then she had cashed his monastery check for him and accepted first and last in cash , and he was settled in . And Rebecca had to admit that Christopher 's delight in the in-law apartment was charming . She 'd never seen a man so grateful for a shower , a hot plate , and a half-fridge . To Br .
