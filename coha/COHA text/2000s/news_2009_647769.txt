After nearly a decade of harsh " antiterrorist " operations that frequently targeted civilians in Chechnya , the Kremlin has declared the mission accomplished and pledged to withdraw at least half its troops from the now pacified , mainly Muslim republic . <p> According to the Kremlin , years of relentless - if often controversial - security measures combined with generous reconstruction aid provided by Moscow have proven to be a winning formula that isolated Chechnya 's separatist and extreme Islamist rebels , cornered them in the republic 's remote mountains , and ultimately defeated them . It is also seen as a victory for former President Vladimir Putin 's strategy of " Chechenizing " the conflict by turning power over to Moscow 's local allies , led by Chechnya 's current strongman Ramzan Kadyrov . <p> Announcing the decision to lift the emergency regime Thursday , the official National Antiterrorism Committee painted a picture of civilian life returning to normal in the formerly embattled territory and stated that Chechnya is now ready to conduct free trade , travel , and investment with other parts of Russia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The situation is stable and this change of status will help us in continuing efforts to restore our economy , build more housing , and attract outside investment , " says Ziyat Sabsibi , who is Mr. Kadyrov 's official representative in Russia 's Federation Council , the upper house of parliament . " We have particularly high hopes of getting investment from the Persian Gulf and Middle East , " where there are large communities of expatriate Chechens , he says . <p> Kadyrov told journalists this week that most former rebels have been either killed or come over to the pro-Moscow local government , leaving " no more than 70 " of them still holed up in mountain hideouts . Lifting the state of emergency will enable Moscow to pull out some 20,000 Interior Ministry forces - though an equal number will remain indefinitely - and also allow the cancellation of curfews , Chechnya 's formerly ubiquitous security check points , and summary house searches by police , he said . <p> Critic : Russian withdrawal ' purely symbolic <p> Critics say it 's true that Chechnya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuses committed by Russian forces in early stages of the war have largely abated . But they argue that life in the little republic of 1.1 million people is anything but normal . They say that the Kremlin has bought the appearance of stability at the cost of consigning Chechnya into a legal black hole , where Mr. Kadyrov 's forces run the republic without regard for the Russian Constitution or even the Kremlin 's authority . <p> " Chechnya exists today as a kind of enclave , completely outside the framework of Russian or international law , " says Tatiana Lokshina , deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Russia , who was reached by phone in Grozny . " This decision to lift the state of emergency has purely symbolic significance for the population of Chechnya . Today , the human rights abuses are committed by pro-Moscow Chechens rather than Russian security forces , but the atmosphere of impunity is the same , " she says . <p> A tiny republic 's dark history <p> The northern Caucasus region , of which Chechnya is part , was conquered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Soviet Union . The Chechens , a warlike mountain nation , rose up repeatedly and declared independence as the USSR was collapsing in 1991 . <p> An invasion launched by then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1994 killed an estimated 100,000 people , mainly civilians , and ended in Russian defeat two years later . But a de facto independent Chechnya became a nexus for crime and subversion throughout the region . After a wave of apartment bombings , blamed on Chechen terrorists , that killed 300 Russians in 1999 , the Kremlin again ordered Russian troops to invade the tiny republic . <p> That war , now almost a decade old , created a flood of refugees and left terror-stricken survivors living a tenuous existence amid the shattered ruins of Grozny and other Chechen cities . In 2004 , the Russian human rights group Memorial estimated that the two wars had killed more than 200,000 civilians and up to 40,000 Russian troops . <p> In addition to thousands of civilians killed as " collateral damage " in antiterrorist military operations , human rights groups allege that Russian security forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , torture , and summary execution . <p> " Over 5,000 people have disappeared without a trace , the vast majority at the hands of the security forces , " says Ms. Lokshina . " Only one Russian officer has ever been convicted for such violations . There is no accountability for the past ; thousands of loved ones have no hope to find justice , and this remains an ongoing source of deep instability . " <p> Tough leader for a tough land <p> The current Chechen leader is the son of Akhmad Kadyrov , a former rebel and Muslim cleric , who was tapped by the Kremlin for leadership but later murdered by Chechen Islamists in a spectacular 2004 stadium bombing . <p> The younger Kadyrov , a bull-necked flamboyant figure , who wears a track suit even on visits to the Kremlin and keeps a pet tiger in his mansion , became the republic 's de facto ruler and was later elected Chechnya 's president in a Moscow-orchestrated political process . <p> Moscow has spent billions of dollars on reconstruction projects in Chechnya , all of it channelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced a further $4.7 billion allocation for the next four years . But some experts fear that Kadyrov is increasingly going his own way . For example , he recently defied Russian law by backing " honor killings " of Chechen women by male relatives , and openly calling for legalized polygamy . " I am saying to everyone , whoever has the desire or the opportunity , you need to take a second wife , " Kadyrov said recently . <p> Malik Saydullayev , a Moscow-based Chechen businessman who unsuccessfully ran for president against Kadyrov , says the Kremlin has capitulated to Kadyrov 's demands for a " normalization " of the republic 's status , but that nothing has been solved for the Chechen people . <p> " There is no real leader , elected by the Chechen people , and in this situation opposition will go on , " Mr. Saydullayev says . " I think that the situation will grow even worse . " <p> Several high-profile critics of Kadyrov have met tragic ends in recent years , including Anna Politkovskaya , a correspondent for the crusading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lobby of her Moscow apartment in 2006 . More recently , a former bodyguard who accused Kadyrov of human rights abuses , Umar Israilov , was murdered in Austria by a Chechen assassin , and former Chechen general and Kadyrov foe Sulim Yamadayev was murdered in Dubai in March . <p> Will Russia 's withdrawal bring more power to Kadyrov ? <p> But even some Kremlin critics argue that Ramzan Kadyrov 's harsh one-man rule in Chechnya may be a necessary evil . " It seems that Kadyrov is the worst option , except for all the others , " says Yulia Latynina , a journalist with Novaya Gazeta . She says the extremist Islamic rebels , who 've spread their struggle around the volatile north Caucasus , are a deadly and growing threat . ( See here for more details . ) <p> " Chechnya under Kadyrov is controlled much more effectively than the neighboring republics of Ingushetia and Dagestan , where things are falling apart , " says Ms. Latynina . " Kadyrov today is the only working institution in Chechnya . There is no society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some who usually back the Kremlin 's tough handling of Chechnya say they have reservations about removing federal forces , because it leaves Kadyrov in sole control of the republic . <p> " Yes , we had to lift the emergency regime in Chechnya , but there are too many ' buts about it , " says Viktor Ilyukhin , a Communist deputy who chairs the State Duma 's security commission . " All this is meant to help Kadyrov to keep Chechnya within Russia , but if financing from Moscow decreases , Kadyrov might change his position toward Russia . I do n't trust Kadyrov .
