PROLOGUE : The Bank Robbery // At 10:30 a.m. on the sultry morning of Wednesday , 26 June 1907 , in the seething central square of Tiflis , a dashing mustachioed cavalry captain in boots and jodhpurs , wielding a big Circassian sabre , performed tricks on horseback , joking with two pretty , well-dressed Georgian girls who twirled gaudy parasols-while fingering Mauser pistols hidden in their dresses . // Raffish young men in bright peasant blouses and wide sailor-style trousers waited on the street corners , cradling secreted revolvers and grenades . At the louche Tilipuchuri Tavern on the square , a crew of heavily armed gangsters took over the cellar bar , gaily inviting passers-by to join them for drinks . All of them were waiting to carry out the first exploit by Josef Djugashvili , aged twenty-nine , later known as Stalin , to win the attention of the world. 1 // Few outside the gang knew of the plan that day for a criminal terrorist " spectacular , " but Stalin had worked on it for months . One man who did know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolshevik Party , 2 hiding in a villa in Kuokola , Finland , far to the north . Days earlier , in Berlin , and then in London , Lenin had secretly met with Stalin to order the big heist , even though their Social-Democratic Party had just strictly banned all " expropriations , " the euphemism for bank robberies . But Stalin ? s operations , heists and killings , always conducted with meticulous attention to detail and secrecy , had made him the " main financier of the Bolshevik Centre . " 3 // The events that day would make headlines all over the globe , literally shake Tiflis to its foundations , and further shatter the fragmented Social-Democrats into warring factions : that day would both make Stalin ? s career and almost ruin it-a watershed in his life . // In Yerevan Square , the twenty brigands who formed the core of Stalin ? s gang , known as " the Outfit , " took up positions as their lookouts peered down Golovinsky Prospect , Tiflis ? s elegant main street , past the white Italianate splendour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clatter of a stagecoach and its squadron of galloping Cossacks . The army captain with the Circassian sabre caracoled on his horse before dismounting to stroll the fashionable boulevard . // Every street corner was guarded by a Cossack or policeman : the authorities were ready . Something had been expected since January . The informers and agents of the Tsar ? s secret police , the Okhrana , and his uniformed political police , the Gendarmes , delivered copious reports about the clandestine plots and feuds of the gangs of revolutionaries and criminals . In the misty twilight of this underground , the worlds of bandit and terrorist had merged and it was hard to tell tricks from truth . But there had been " chatter " about a " spectacular " - as today ? s intelligence experts would put it-for months . // On that dazzling steamy morning , the Oriental colour of Tiflis ( now Tbilisi , the capital of the Republic of Georgia ) hardly seemed to belong to the same world as the Tsar ? s capital , St. Petersburg , a thousand miles away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound up the slopes of Mtatsminda , Holy Mountain , until they were impossibly steep , full of crookedly picturesque houses weighed down with balconies , entwined with old vines . Tiflis was a big village where everyone knew everyone else . // Just behind the military headquarters , on genteel Freilinskaya Street , a stone ? s throw from the square , lived Stalin ? s wife , a pretty young Georgian dressmaker named Kato Svanidze , and their newborn son , Yakov . Theirs was a true love match : despite his black moods , Stalin was devoted to Kato , who admired and shared his revolutionary fervour . As she sunned herself and the baby on her balcony , her husband was about to give her , and Tiflis itself , an unholy shock . // This intimate city was the capital of the Caucasus , the Tsar ? s wild , mountainous viceroyalty between the Black and the Caspian Seas , a turbulent region of fierce and feuding peoples . Golovinsky Prospect seemed Parisian in its elegance . White neo-classical theatres , a Moorish-style opera house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil barons lined the street , but , as one passed the military headquarters , Yerevan Square opened up into an Asiatic potpourri . // Exotically dressed hawkers and stalls offered spicy Georgian lobio beans and hot khachapuri cheesecake . Water-carriers , street-traders , pickpockets and porters delivered to or stole from the Armenian and Persian Bazaars , the alleyways of which more resembled a Levantine souk than a European city . Caravans of camels and donkeys , loaded with silks and spices from Persia and Turkestan , fruit and wineskins from the lush Georgian countryside , ambled through the gates of the Caravanserai . Its young waiters and errand boys served its clientele of guests and diners , carrying in the bags , unharnessing the camels-and watching the square . Now we know from the newly opened Georgian archives that Stalin , Faginlike , used the Caravanserai boys as a prepubescent revolutionary street intelligence and courier service . Meanwhile in one of the Caravanserai ? s cavernous backrooms , the chief gangsters gave their gunmen a pep talk , rehearsing the plan one last time . Stalin himself was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twirling umbrellas and loaded revolvers , Patsia Goldava and Anneta Sulakvelidze , " brown-haired , svelte , with black eyes that expressed youth , " casually sashayed across the square to stand outside the military headquarters , where they flirted with Russian officers , Gendarmes in smart blue uniforms , and bowlegged Cossacks . // Tiflis was-and still is-a languid town of strollers and boulevardiers who frequently stop to drink wine at the many open-air taverns : if the showy , excitable Georgians resemble any other European people , it is the Italians . Georgians and other Caucasian men , in traditional chokha - their skirted long coats lined down the chest with bullet pouches-swaggered down the streets , singing loudly . Georgian women in black headscarves , and the wives of Russian officers in European fashions , promenaded through the gates of the Pushkin Gardens , buying ices and sherbet alongside Persians and Armenians , Chechens , Abkhaz and Mountain Jews , in a fancy-dress jamboree of hats and costumes . // Gangs of street urchins- kinto s-furtively scanned the crowds for scams . Teenage trainee priests , in long white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pillared white seminary across the street , where Stalin had almost qualified as a priest nine years earlier . This un-Slavic , un-Russian and ferociously Caucasian kaleidoscope of East and West was the world that nurtured Stalin . // Checking the time , the girls Anneta and Patsia parted , taking up new positions on either side of the square . On Palace Street , the dubious clientele of the notorious Tilipuchuri Tavern-princes , pimps , informers and pickpockets-were already drinking Georgian wine and Armenian brandy , not far from the plutocratic grandeur of Prince Sumbatov ? s palace . // Just then David Sagirashvili , another revolutionary who knew Stalin and some of the gangsters , visited a friend who owned a shop above the tavern and was invited in by the cheerful brigand at the doorway , Bachua Kupriashvili , who " immediately offered me a chair and a glass of red wine , according to the Georgian custom . " David drank the wine and was about to leave when the gunman suggested " with exquisite politeness " that he stay inside and " sample more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were letting people into the restaurant but would not let them out . Armed individuals stood at the door . " // Spotting the convoy galloping down the boulevard , Patsia Goldava , the slim brunette on lookout , sped round the corner to the Pushkin Gardens where she waved her newspaper to Stepko Intskirveli , waiting by the gate . // " We ? re off ! " he muttered . // Stepko nodded at Anneta Sulakvelidze , who was across the street just outside the Tilipuchuri , where she made a sign summoning the others from the bar . The gunmen in the doorway beckoned them . " At a given signal " Sagirashvili saw the brigands in the tavern put down their drinks , cock their pistols and head out , spreading across the square-thin , consumptive young men in wide trousers who had barely eaten for weeks . Some were gangsters , some desperadoes and some , typically for Georgia , were poverty-stricken princes from roofless , wall-less castles in the provinces . If their deeds were criminal , they cared nothing for money : they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiflis , Stalin . // " The functions of each of us had been planned in advance , " remembered a third girl in the gang , Alexandra Darakhvelidze , just nineteen , a friend of Anneta , and already veteran of a spree of heists and shootouts. // The gangsters each covered the square ? s policemen-the gorodovoi , known in the streets as pharaoh s . Two gunmen marked the Cossacks outside the City Hall ; the rest made their way to the corner of Velyaminov Street and the Armenian Bazaar , not far from the State Bank itself . Alexandra Darakhvelidze , in her unpublished memoirs , recalled guarding one of the street corners with two gunmen . // Now Bachua Kupriashvili , nonchalantly pretending to read a newspaper , spotted in the distance the cloud of dust thrown up by the horses ? hooves . They were coming ! Bachua rolled up his newspaper , poised . . . The cavalry captain with the flashing sabre , who had been promenading the square , now warned passers-by to stay out of it , but when no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was no officer but the ideal of the Georgian beau sabreur and outlaw , half-knight , half-bandit . This was Kamo , aged twenty-five , boss of the Outfit and , as Stalin put it , " a master of disguise " who could pass for a rich prince or a peasant laundrywoman . He moved stiffly , his half-blind left eye squinting and rolling : one of his own bombs had exploded in his face just weeks before . He was still recuperating. // Kamo " was completely enthralled " by Stalin , who had converted him to Marxism . They had grown up together in the violent town of Gori forty-five miles away . He was a bank robber of ingenious audacity , a Houdini of prison-escapes , a credulous simpleton-and a half-insane practitioner of psychopathic violence . Intensely , eerily tranquil with a weird " lustreless face " and a blank gaze , he was keen to serve his master , often begging Stalin : " Let me kill him for you ! " No deed of macabre horror or courageous flamboyance was beyond him : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest and cut out his heart . // Throughout his life , Stalin ? s detached magnetism would attract , and win the devotion of , amoral , unbounded psychopaths . His boyhood henchman Kamo and these gangsters were the first in a long line . " Those young men followed Stalin selflessly . . . Their admiration for him allowed him to impose on them his iron discipline . " 4 Kamo often visited Stalin ? s home , where he had earlier borrowed Kato ? s father ? s sabre , explaining that he was " going to play an officer of the Cossacks . " 5 Even Lenin , that fastidious lawyer , raised as a nobleman , was fascinated by the daredevil Kamo , whom he called his " Caucasian bandit . " " Kamo , " mused Stalin in old age , " was a truly amazing person . " 6 // " Captain " Kamo turned his horse towards the boulevard and trotted audaciously right past the advancing convoy , coming the other way . Once the shooting started , he boasted , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The Cossacks galloped into Yerevan Square , two in front , two behind and another alongside the two carriages . Through the dust , the gangsters could make out that the stagecoach contained two men in frockcoats-the State Bank ? s cashier Kurdyumov and accountant Golovnya-and two soldiers with rifles cocked , while a second phaeton was packed with police and soldiers . In the thunder of hooves , it took just seconds for the carriages and horsemen to cross the square ready to turn into Sololaki Street , where stood the new State Bank : the statues of lions and gods over its door represented the surging prosperity of Russian capitalism. 7 // Bachua lowered his newspaper , giving the sign , then tossed it aside , reaching for his weapons . The gangsters drew out what they nicknamed their " apples " - powerful grenades which had been smuggled into Tiflis by the girls Anneta and Alexandra , hidden inside a big sofa . // The gunmen and the girls stepped forward , pulled the fuses and tossed four grenades which exploded under the carriages with a deafening noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pieces , spattering the cobbles with innards and blood . The brigands drew their Mauser and Browning pistols and opened fire on the Cossacks and police around the square who , caught totally unawares , fell wounded or ran for cover . More than ten bombs exploded . Witnesses thought they rained from every direction , even the rooftops : it was later said that Stalin had thrown the first bomb from the roof of Prince Sumbatov ? s mansion . // The bank ? s carriages stopped . Screaming passers-by scrambled for cover . Some thought it was an earthquake : was Holy Mountain falling on to the city ? " No one could tell if the terrible shooting was the boom of cannons or explosion of bombs , " reported the Georgian newspaper Isari ( Arrow ) . " The sound caused panic everywhere . . . almost across the whole city , people started running . Carriages and carts were galloping away . . . " Chimneys had toppled from buildings ; every pane of glass was shattered as far as the Viceroy ? s Palace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalin ? s baby with her family , " when all of a sudden we heard the sound of bombs , " recalled her sister , Sashiko . " Terrified , we rushed into the house . " Outside , amid the yellow smoke and the wild chaos , among the bodies of horses and mutilated limbs of men , something had gone wrong . // One horse attached to the front carriage twitched , then jerked back to life . Just as the gangsters ran to seize the moneybags in the back of the carriage , the horse reared up out of the mayhem and bolted down the hill towards the Soldiers Bazaar , disappearing with the money that Stalin had promised Lenin for the Revolution. 8 // NOTES // 1 This account of the Tiflis expropriation is based on the many sources listed in this note .
