Many of the photographers  --  working with sophisticated cameras that can produce an occasional striking image almost without human intervention  --  won a brief success . But three successive decades have drastically winnowed their numbers , and only a few now stand in the ranks of mastery that include such predecessors as Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans . <P> Tall among them is Sally Mann .

First , she turned to pictures of her surroundings . More recently , she has taken her incomparably truthful large-frame camera farther south , into Georgia , Mississippi and Louisiana . From the heart of the Old South 's dark history she has returned with eloquent images  --  devoid of human presence  --  of the rivers and thickets that continue to harbor our whole country 's greatest mystery : how human beings , in the midst of such fecund natural beauty , have continued to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or place have matched Sally Mann 's steadiness of simple eyesight , her serene technical brilliance and the clearly communicated eloquence she derives from her subjects , human and otherwise  --  subjects observed with an ardor that is all but indistinguishable from love . <P> Reynolds Price is the author of more than 30 books , including Kate Vaiden , for which he received the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1986
