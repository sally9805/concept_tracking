<p> Gary Hamel , one of today 's hottest management gurus , was speaking to a crowd of top business-school officials via a large video screen . His message was not reassuring . Imagine , Mr. Hamel postulated , if a virtual university brought to one online venue the best business-teaching minds - a superstar team . Would n't that change the competitive landscape for business schools worldwide ? " It was a pretty cool moment , " recalls Theodore Buchholz , president of Harcourt College Publishers , who was present at the Santa Monica , Calif. , gathering last spring . " What Hamel said sent a shiver up everyone 's spine ... It seemed like the immovable could be shaken . " Afterward , conversation gradually returned to normal . But the idea that faculty superstars might one day become " unbundled " from their universities has become a point of growing debate in higher education . While the impact of online education gets the lion 's share of attention , other factors , such as a growing split on campus between well-paid full professors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt to a single institution . The result is that already independent-minded professors perceive themselves more as free agents than ever before , some say . " The faculty is going to face a serious redefinition , " says James Duderstadt , former president of the University of Michigan , who is involved in a project to assess the future of universities . " In a sense , what we are going to see is the technology democratize access to learning opportunities , knowledge resources , and to scholarship . " If the foundations of prestigious schools are not shaking yet , that may be because higher education has so far mostly coexisted quite nicely with its star professors . Yet it 's also true that in the past century , most faculty stars have played second fiddle to the great universities where they teach . But that is changing . Only news junkies who watched CNN through the election wrangle , for example , would probably know Laurence Tribe is Harvard Law School 's High Court superstar . As 21st-century technology and publishing trends alter professors ' roles , signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics professor at the University of California , Irvine , replaces his own lectures with a CD-ROM . Recordings and samples of his course are available on the Web and for sale worldwide through a textbook publisher . * Jerry Porras , an author and professor at Stanford University 's Graduate School of Business , is one of several professors from prominent universities helping Cardean University , a " virtual " school , create an online management class . * Harvard Prof. N. Greg Mankiw is rewarded a record $ 1 million advance from a publisher for a new economics textbook . Some academics envision a sea change in the next five or 10 years in which the likes of Drs . Tribe , Mankiw , Porras , and Navarro might sell their teaching services to the highest bidder . They might command even more money if they can attract a mass audience over the Internet . " The best faculty would have the recognition rock stars enjoy , " says Arthur Levine , president of Teachers College at Columbia University in New York . " They might be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1,000 at a single big university . " That change would precipitate a further shift of power in academia . Picture a world in which two or three professors in each academic discipline are paid like Manny Ramirez , the Boston Red Sox superstar , who just inked a contract for $ 160 million over eight years . <p> Faculty haves and have-nots If that seems a stretch , consider the changes in compensation since the 1980s , when university faculty members all received roughly similar pay , with few standouts . Market forces have torn asunder that practice , says Jack Schuster , a professor of education and public policy at Claremont Graduate University in California . The trend in faculty pay and status today is toward haves and have nots , rather than equity . There are about 1 million faculty members , about half of them full time , at the roughly 3,700 accredited two-year and four-year institutions , Dr. Schuster says . Full professors may pull down $ 100,000 - and a tiny fraction are " superstars " who earn perhaps $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Meanwhile , a growing proportion of the faculty are low-paid adjunct professors who migrate from job to job without any prospect of tenure . That dichotomy could create a powerful incentive to split from the university and go with the highest Internet bidder . Changes in the way learning is delivered are going to happen much sooner than people realize , says Dr. Duderstadt , the former president of the University of Michigan . But it wo n't be all smooth sailing for faculty . Just as universities will have trouble maintaining their hold on academic credentialing , the faculty itself " wo n't have a monopoly on scholarship either . They 're going to have to compete with a lot of folks around the world that they 've never had to compete with before , " Duderstadt says . Universities are n't standing still , though . A number have created for-profit arms to offer degrees online . And many schools are more closely overseeing contractual relationships faculty have with publishers and online entities ( see story at right ) . <p> The Carl Sagan effect Dr. Levine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood in the middle of the past century . " Once upon a time what mattered were the studios , " he says . " They employed the actors . Today , if a film is from DreamWorks or Universal , do you care ? No . But if it has my favorite star , that will take me to the movies . " Until his passing in 1996 , astronomer Carl Sagan was one of the most popular professors ever , Levine points out . From his televised explanations of the cosmos , references to " billions and billions " of stars entered the popular lexicon . " It does n't matter where Carl Sagan came from , " Levine says . " It could have been Harvard or Cornell . No one cares . People just wanted to see him . " Not everybody worries that technology will displace traditional education , of course , including Mankiw , the Harvard professor who last summer won a million-dollar advance in a bidding war over his new college textbook , " Principles of Economics . " Mankiw observes that no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsolete - and others were convinced television in the classroom was the wave of the future . " There 's always been a question about whether technology would revolutionize education , " he says . " I still think the good teacher , small class , books , and discussion groups are the best way to teach . The advantages of the Internet and PowerPoint presentation software and everything else people are pushing these days is wildly overstated . " Even some who might be expected to endorse an overthrow of the establishment are not doing it . Take , for instance , Cardean University - a virtual university that draws its teaching talent for its online business courses from universities including the London School of Economics , Stanford University , and the University of Chicago . " There 's been lot of concern about this free-agent phenomenon in higher education - everyone 's seen bits of it , " says Geoff Cox , former vice-provost at Princeton University in New Jersey , now provost at Cardean University . " We 've taken the position that the real measure of credibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Students siphoned off ? Navarro of UC-Irvine is n't so sure that the universities are doing enough to prevent an erosion of the faculty if predictions about all-star teams come to pass . He himself uses new technologies , giving students a CD-ROM for basic instruction so that class time is free for more-complex discussion . Studies over several years , he says , have shown no dropoff in how much students learn through this new style of class . But Navarro worries that a superstar faculty on the Web is inevitable and will decimate institutions like his own . " Will students choose the superstar economics professor from Wharton - or take the class here ? " he asks . It 's a question Gary Burke thinks about a lot . As publisher for economics at McGraw-Hill Education , he helped produce Navarro 's CD-ROM and has put sample content from it on the Web . Mr. Burke says the push toward faculty superstars who span several media are a trend in his industry . Burke plans to make Paul Solman , a Harvard economics professor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to college students around the world on different digital platforms . " He 'll give lectures and demonstrations on the basic concepts of economics , " Burke says . " We will put them on the Internet , CD-ROM , DVD , and so-forth . He could be a superstar . We 'll see .
