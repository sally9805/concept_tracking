Last month Esther Friesner regaled us with a tale of Texas that was at least half bull ( if you catch my drift ) . Texas denizen Bill Spencer did not write the following story in response to Ms. Friesner 's woolly and wild portrait of the Lone Star State , but it 's interesting to read Mr. Spencer 's portrait of a northeasterner seeking solace in nature with Ms. Friesner 's story in mind . Bill Spencer jokingly calls himself a recluse , but the Austin resident has been seen recently at social affairs such as his own wedding . His c. v. includes two of the most delightful novels of the 1990s , Resume with Monsters and Zod Wallop . The favorite writers of his youth include Raymond L. Ditmars and Frank W. Lane . <p> I HAD WON THE LOTTERY , the ultimate deus ex machina . My wife was stunned by our good fortune , disoriented and faintly miffed for she had always scoffed at my lottery tickets , explaining that a person was more apt to be bitten by a rattlesnake while plummeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she would say - than get that winning number . I had won , we were rich , and I was very pleased with myself . I could see that Audrey still thought I was dead wrong , that lotteries were the opiate of the people , a game for probability-challenged chumps . However , had events demonstrated the rightness of Audrey 's position , we would still be toiling in the English department at Clayton College , a dreary four  --  year diploma mill with a lovely campus , a mummified faculty , and a student body derived almost entirely from the Church of Christ contingent in certain small towns in Pennsylvania . We had only settled on Clayton because it offered jobs for the both of us . Audrey had sacrificed the most for that berth . While I taught the glamor stuff , Shakespeare and Spenser and Renaissance poetry , my wife tried to introduce English grammar into the minds of adolescents raised on television and movies - minds that were very nearly immune to syntax . It did n't take Audrey long to embrace our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller sum would have set us free ; our desires were modest . We wanted to get away from the infernal ever-busy world , to find a quiet niche where we could read ( the unalloyed pleasure of selfish reading , the decadence of perusing books and tossing them aside half read , the dirty thrill of reading novels of no critical merit whatever or old childhood treasures from which the narcotic of nostalgia could be slowly sucked ) and , of course , to write . We bought a house on twenty acres of land in a town beyond the reach of city commuters . We were far from the madding crowd 's ignoble strife and spared the reinvented Main Street , the historical markers on every house , the hideous quaintness of the polished past . Our town was a little run-down ; the unimaginative might even have found it ugly . We loved it . We lined our rambling , three-story farm house with bookshelves throughout and furnished it with stuff foraged from neighborhood yard sales and junk shops ( dressers , mirrors , end tables , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good a representation of Queen Victoria in decline as any sofa I have ever seen ) . Once settled , neither of us rushed into writing projects , although Audrey was by far the more industrious . One evening she read me a passage in which her nine-year-old self had accidentally been locked out of the summer house in Sag Harbor during a thunderstorm while her parents partied within . She had only been outside a short time , a minute perhaps before her absence was discovered , but it was time enough to get thoroughly wet and abandon a belief system that included loving parents . I thought it was a powerful piece , and I was impressed with the book 's tentative title , Spite , which struck me as everything a memoir 's title should be , forthright , unsparing , monosyllabic . While I had n't gotten so far as to conjure a working title or turn any of my thoughts into something as substantial as a paragraph of prose or some lines of poetry , I had spent considerable time deciding just what I intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth of fourteen , I had wanted to be a lyric poet , but I had failed at that early , discovering that my poetry repelled girls who had initially been drawn to me . In college I considered becoming a novelist , but I was no good at character and if by sheer perseverance I managed to create some sort of fictional personage , I did n't have a clue what to do with him , sending him lurching off down the street like Dr. Frankenstein 's monster , inevitably parking him in a cafe or bar where he would talk interminably to some other sadly cobbled  --  together creature . Nope , not novels . I toyed with the idea of a memoir , but my past bored me . I had no wish to revisit it . By a process of elimination , I was closing on my vocation . I was reading voraciously , ecstatically , and I had been at it for two months . I expected to find my blushing Muse in the next book that came to hand . ONE NIGHT WE were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breath and looked up from my book to see Audrey staring wide-eyed in my direction . Her Henry James ( Washington Square , if memory serves ) was open on her lap . It was late , about eleven I would guess , and we sat at opposite sides of the room , each of us enclosed in the light of our separate lamps while the books that surrounded us were imbued with dusky mystery and an almost erotic sense of solace . " Jonathan ? " She slapped a hand to her breast as though assaulted by a sudden pain . I assumed she had been taken with some particularly powerful passage and was so expressing herself , for we were both guilty of melodrama in our passion for literature , but then she toppled forward , the book ( a Modern Library with those almost transparent pages , those tight thickets of immortal prose ) fluttering as she fell . I marked my place and rushed to her aid . She lay sprawled on the carpet , her flowing blue robe in sweet disarray , her red hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felled by the news of her lover 's death in a foreign land , the child within her still unknown to the inflexible society of her peers . I bent down and taking her shoulders lifted her gently , turning her toward me . Did I say that Audrey is beautiful ? When I read Jane Austen , I think of my wife , the logic of her cheekbones , the wit of her mouth , her unequivocal eyebrows . Her eyelids fluttered . " Jonathan ? " She seemed incapable of anything else , her mouth open in amazement . Her chest heaved ; she gasped . " I ca n't - I ca n't breathe . " A series of desperate phone calls revealed that the closest hospital was forty-five miles to the west but that a Dr. Bath would be willing to rouse himself from sleep and meet us at his office at the comer of Maple and Main , a mere five minutes from our home . A ROUNDISH WOMAN swathed in black fabric and wearing a nurse 's white cap opened the door before I knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing us both into the room and informing us that she was the doctor 's wife . The room was like every doctor 's waiting room I have ever seen , a coffee table strewn with old magazines , sofas pining for better days , and a harsh , sourceless light , the cruel illumination of purgatory . Mrs. Bath left us on the sofa and went to fetch her husband . By now Audrey 's face was red and her breathing was an agony of effort , shaking her small frame . A wheeze that made my ribs ache underlined her every inhalation . Mrs. Bath returned with her husband , a stout , balding man . He shook my hand and said , " Yes , I am Dr. Bath . And this is your wife , the emergency ? " We both looked at Audrey , and I said , " Yes . " The doctor wore a black suit and seemed disappointed , although whether this was because Audrey did n't look like emergency enough or looked like more emergency than he had bargained for , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sofa where she was hunched forward in private communication with her lungs . Flanked by the doctor and his wife , Audrey was led past the reception desk toward the hall . Something in their progress , their tentative exit , put me in mind of two skaters guiding a novice across the ice . I waited on the sofa while the doctor and Mrs. Bath attended my wife . I shuffled through the magazines on the coffee table , seeking something to occupy my mind , but I was certain I did n't want to read anything about infants or celebrities or health or crafts , and I was growing irritated with this foraging when - I found my Muse ! My Muse resided within the unlikely confines of a thin , battered paperback entitled Pilgrim at Tinker Creek by someone named Annie Dillard . I noted a number of laudatory blurbs on the back and began reading . I had no premonition , no shiver of recognition on opening the book , that my inspiration would lie within . I was instantly intrigued . So engrossed was I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanked again by the doctor and his wife . All three were smiling . Audrey 's smile was weak , relieved more than celebratory , but it lifted my heart . I wrote a check for $85 while the doctor talked . He was more animated now , hearty and pleased with himself . " Your wife , she has the spider bite ! " he said . " Right there on the ankles . Hah ! Or maybe the bee sting or a , what you call , centepeeder ? Not everyone are allergic . Most , they just say , " Ow ! " and forget about it . " Here the doctor shrugged to indicate a cavalier attitude toward such attacks . " But your wife , she has the reactions , so I give her the shot and these pills , samples while the drugstore does not open . Problems ? You must call . " I asked Mrs. Bath if I might have the paperback I was holding in my hand , and she sold it to me for five dollars , which seemed a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our home , slowly , keeping an eye out for nocturnal creatures that might race from the surrounding woods and hurl themselves beneath our wheels , I could not contain my enthusiasm . " I know what I 'm going to write , " I told Audrey . She turned her head , her cheek flat against the backrest , her red hair matted in thick ribbons . She was clearly exhausted , and she regarded me with blue eyes that were uncharacteristically blank . Ordinarily , Audrey would have expressed delight , urged me to elaborate , but she was n't up to it that night . I understood , and I should have left it till morning , but I could n't contain the good news . " I am going to write essays ! Nature essays . You know , thoughtful pieces in which nature serves as a sort of jumping off place for larger topics . Caterpillar-to-butterfly stuff about transformation , a little something from Ovid or Hazlitt or Burton thrown in . The world is but a school for inquiry , " after all . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Our property has woods , a pond , a small creek . I have n't seen the creek yet , but the real estate agent said it was there , no reason to doubt her . And here we are in April , everything coming alive . " When that Aprile with his shoures soote the droghte of March hath perced to the roote , " that sort of thing . " Audrey rolled her eyes , snorted derisively . " What ? " I asked . My wife exhaled ( the tiniest trace of a wheeze still there ) and looked at me as though I 'd just announced that I intended to run for President . " What ? I think the essay is the perfect vehicle for my temperament and - " " Nature , Jonathan . What do you know about nature ? " " Well . " I was caught off balance by this attack , so unlike my wife . I realized later that Audrey was speaking in the immediate aftermath of a life-threatening encounter with a tiny piece of nature . No wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , however , I was hurt . " I believe I have a layman 's knowledge of the natural world , " I said , hating the prissy tightness in my throat . " No one would ever describe you as an outdoors person , " Audrey said . " I do n't believe I need to be climbing mountains or rafting down the Amazon to write about nature . " " No , " Audrey said . " I do n't suppose so . But you need .... " She paused . She stretched the tip of her tongue to touch her upper lip , a habit she had when looking within , and one I generally found endearing . She smiled . " Name three trees . " " What ? " " Come on , name three trees . That 's an easy one . " Yes , an easy one , insultingly so , beneath reply . Mistaking my silence for ignorance , her smile enlarged , so I snapped back , " Juniper , Christmas , Mimosa ! " and she continued to grin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself fretting that juniper might be , technically , more of a shrub than a tree . But I was n't going to have my Muse belittled by continuing the conversation . I changed the subject . " I 'm glad you are all right , " I said . " Not as glad as I am , " she said , which probably meant nothing , but it felt like a rebuke . I drove the rest of the way in silence , and when we pulled into our yard , Audrey said , " All out for Walden . " In spite of my wife 's sarcasm , I was convinced that the essay was the form for me . For one thing , I was wealthy . With wealth came leisure , and leisure encouraged reflection . It occurred to me that one of the great charms of the essay was this conveyed sense that its author had all the time in the world . The authors of essays drifted in a fog of indolence , contemplating objects and events , pursuing literary allusions with scholarly languor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jiffy Lube on his lunch hour , could only dream of some faraway retirement when time would cease to flog him with errands and obligations . To read an essay was to enter a world of literary and philosophical loafing , to wade in that slow river of time . Readers of essays could , for the span of the piece , escape their deadline days . I had every confidence that I could give the reader his money 's worth in reflection , but I thought I might have trouble with the nature part . While I did n't feel I was as ill-equipped for the job as Audrey believed , it is true I never had warmed to nature as a child . I never had an urge to climb a tree , own a turtle , look under a log , or catch a fish . I was n't immune to the beauty of autumn , with hills transformed by garish yellows and reds , and spring , with its thousand shades of green , was a wonder of renewal , no doubt about it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , I had always kept a cool distance from the natural world , which I perceived as deadly and erratic , the rotting rabbit by the side of the road , festering with maggots , the yellow jackets that buzzed around the picnic table , climbing down the throat of the open Coke bottle . NATURE COULD BE hostile , as Bob , of Bob 's Bug and Vermin Blasters , reminded me . Audrey and I had decided to purge the house of bugs to prevent a second occurrence of that harrowing night , and Bob 's Bug and Vermin Blasters was the only local establishment for such services . Bob was a large man outfitted in olive drab camouflage , his pants stuffed into gray rubber boots . He had laughed , an incredulous , seal-like sound muffled by his mustache , when Audrey expressed her reservations regarding the contents of the canister that he intended to spray inside and outside the house . " Yes , ma'am , " he said . " This here is deadly poison . That 's a fact . Might be you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and winking out from under bushy eyebrows , showed deep amusement . " Just sprinkle some garlic on the bastards . Or say a prayer . You know what the word organic means to a bug ? It means dinner . " Bob made more seal sounds . Audrey turned and left the room without saying anything , and I accompanied Bob on his rounds , watched him go through the house , crawling under the kitchen sink , squirting death behind the refrigerator , in the cupboards , along the baseboards . When he headed off to the basement , I left him to his work and went outside . I sat on the porch reading some more of the Dillard book until Bob came outside and I tagged along again , watching him as be drilled deep holes into the cinder block and squirted poison into the holes . All the while , he supplied me with a wealth of anecdotal material about his trade . " Ants are mad about electricity , " he said . " I 've known them to eat the insulation off wires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around electrical terminals . All the lights go off in your house , it could be ants feeding their addiction . And the thing about ants , the thing about a lot of bugs , is they do n't give a goddam whether they live or die . That 's an edge they got in the war . And you might think war 's an exaggeration for it , but I 've been in the business a long time , and war 's the word . And there ai n't a clear winner yet . " When Bob had finished with the house , he said , " I 'll just mosey around the property , see if there 's any problems brewing , maybe a big hive . There 's a hell of a lot to be said for a preemptive strike . " I watched him set out toward the woods , the canister balanced on his shoulder , an American warrior , and I went back in for dinner . Audrey was sitting in the kitchen , her elbows planted on the table , a book open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shock . She was reading For Whom the Bell Tolls . I just stood and stared until she sensed my presence , turned around and looked up . " What ? " " I thought you hated Hemingway ? " Audrey looked a little sheepish , then defiant . " He has hardly any commas . " I raised my eyebrows in query . " I ca n't handle commas right now , " she said . " I ca n't breathe on a comma . And Henry James ... all those commas . I nearly fainted trying to catch my breath . " I did n't know what to say , so I just nodded my head and moved on to the refrigerator . In retrospect , I guess it was a warning I should have heeded . But retrospect and two dollars and fifty cents will get you a latte at Starbucks . THAT NIGHT I was reading in bed when I heard an engine cough into life . I knew it was n't someone making off with our Camry ; that would have been a different sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine in need of a tune-up . I slipped out of bed , taking care not to wake Audrey , and went to the window in time to see red taillights curve down the driveway and disappear past the trees . I realized that I had just seen Bob leaving in his truck . I had forgotten entirely about Bob . I looked at my watch . It was ten minutes past midnight . I marveled at such dedication . Say what you will about country folk , their work ethic is admirable , an example for the rest of us . I returned to the bed and decided that I 'd better get some sleep myself . Tomorrow I planned to confront nature , armed with a notepad , a pencil , and a will to revel in her wonders , no matter how stony the soil , how overgrown the path . As I moved toward the bed , Audrey stirred in her sleep , stretched and turned on her side , rolling the bedsheet with her and pulling it up past her feet . I bent to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pale green patch of light . I leaned closer . Between her ankle and her heel , an area of skin the size of a quarter glowed with the yellow-green luminosity of a night clock 's hands . As I studied this glowing spot , it dimmed and disappeared . Odd , I thought . I pulled the covers over her feet , resolving to mention it in the morning . I remembered that the spider or mite or whatever had launched its assault on her ankle . No doubt this was a related effect , nothing to worry about . Still , it might signify the onslaught of infection . Audrey might not be aware of the phenomenon if it only manifested itself while she slept . Another consultation with Dr. Bath might be in order . I slept poorly and dreamed that I was back at Clayton teaching a class on biology , and Francis Bacon had come to demonstrate to my students just how to stuff a chicken with snow , this being the famous experiment that had led to his death by pneumonia . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing an ugly blue dress , and I asked him to leave and he took a swing at me with the chicken , but then the dream 's logic broke down , and the chicken , while still looking like a chicken , was much larger , was , in fact , my old high school drama teacher , Mrs. Unger , and I woke up . It took me half an hour to get back to sleep , and the sleep I gleaned was shallow , the dregs of rest . I WAS N'T FEELING entirely fit in the morning , but I probably would have remembered to mention the ankle business after my first cup of coffee . Audrey , no more of a morning person than I , lumbered down from the bathroom where her morning ablutions had taken an inordinately long time . I looked at her and was ... well , puzzled . We men know that sometimes the women in our lives will look different . I ca n't speak for all men , but I know that I have an uncanny sensitivity to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer in the forest on hearing the snap of a twig . New hair style ? New lipstick , new eye shadow ? Is this alteration for my benefit ? Is a compliment in order ? It can be a panicky moment . Not all new looks are planned or , if planned , executed with success . if some new hair style is , in Audrey 's opinion , a great disaster , or if - an early learning experience - she has simply slept funny on her hair , producing a fuzzy , disheveled effect , a compliment can precipitate tears . I was more baffled than usual . Audrey looked like Audrey and then again , quite different . She seemed to have a higher forehead , a just  --  scrubbed look , a nakedness of feature and a new bluntness to her gaze . Audrey is very intuitive , and we have been married for ten years - we were married just after we got our undergraduate degrees - so she sensed my confusion . " Eyebrows , " she said . " Excuse me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at myself in the mirror , and , I do n't know , they looked superfluous . " I had one of those revelations which , despite several bad experiences , I always share . " Like commas ! " I said . " What ? " " Well , eyebrows are sort of like commas , and you 've been having this thing about commas , not liking them . " " That 's the craziest thing I 've ever heard , " Audrey said . " Is it ? " I jumped up , ran into the living room , and returned with For Whom the Bell Tolls . I plopped the book down in front of her and flipped the pages . " Okay , I 'm crazy . What 's this ? " Every comma had been sliced with a short red line , that little mincing flourish that is the copy editor 's delete symbol . There were a lot of red deletes , more than I would have expected in Hemingway . Audrey stood up suddenly and snatched the book from the table , clutching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invitation to abuse another person 's privacy . " " It 's just a book ; it 's not your diary . " Audrey sniffed . " And I suppose that The Great Gatsby is just a book ? " She had me there . My copy of The Great Gatsby is a very personal , passionately annotated book , and I had thrown - I winced to remember - a fit when I found Audrey reading it . " You 're right , " I said . " I 'm sorry . I 'm a lout . I do n't know how you put up with me . " Audrey is not one to hold a grudge , and we hugged each other and kissed . I drank the rest of my coffee standing up . I set the mug down , grabbed my backpack , and moved to the door . " Today 's the big day , off into the wilderness to bag some inspiration . " " Yes , I can see . Good luck . " Audrey wiggled her fingers at me . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a pale meadow and the vibrant green of the trees beyond . I was a little nervous , so much seemed to ride on this venture . Did I really have the stuff it took to be an essayist ? I had made preparations for the journey journey may be too extravagant a word for an outing that does n't leave home ) . I wore heavy khaki pants , hiking boots , a long-sleeved flannel shirt , a backpack containing a first-aid kit , a packed lunch ( baloney sandwich , apple , cheese ) , a flashlight , a spade , two jars for specimens , several balls of twine , my notepad and pencils , a pocket knife , a compass , and a bottle of spring water . I entered the meadow . The straw-colored grass reached to my waist . I ignored the disquiet that came with a sudden sense of vulnerability . The pale blue sky loomed over me , tattered scraps of cloud moving slowly , animated by the same wind that stirred the grass . Waves of amber , I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image was n't original . But I was getting the hang of this , marching along , my initial trepidation eased by the comforting weight of the sun on my neck and shoulders . The gods lie in wait for the overly confident , and just as I was loosening up , living in the moment , something exploded in front of me with a great whirring and fury , a brown blur aimed at my head , and I stumbled backward and fell , my heart banging around in my chest . I scrambled back up and saw a bird flapping its way to the clouds . I remembered a movie I had seen in which hunters with shotguns and dogs had hunted birds - were they called wrens ? That does n't seem quite it  --  in a meadow like this , the birds blasting out of the ground with the same whup-whup-whup sound that I had just experienced . I was briskly heading back to the house as I thought this , my rational mind trying to retake the higher ground . I scolded my inner coward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you running ? I continued on course to the house , but I managed , by an act of will , to veer right and down a hill toward the small pond and the clump of sentinel willows - there 's another tree , Audrey - and by the time I reached the muddy , weed-strewn bank , I was breathing heavily but relatively calm again . Thoreau got a lot of mileage out of a pond , and I saw no reason why I could n't squeeze some fine writing out of my own pond . Unfortunately , up close , its charms diminished . The pond had no precise boundary , at least not where I came upon it . Green weeds marched into the water which was filmed with a yellow-green scum . When I stirred this with a stick , the end of the stick came away with fleshy , dripping blobs of goo . My research brought me too close to the edge , and I was suddenly ankle deep in black , stinking mud , flailing my arms to keep from falling forward , yanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primal sound of disgust came unbidden from my throat . Small gnats buzzed up in a peppery cloud and rushed at my mouth , nose , and eyes with suicidal abandon ( they do n't give a goddam whether they live or die , I heard Bob saying ) . That did it for the day , and I headed back to the house , depressed and angry with myself . I found Audrey on the porch in the rattan chair . Her head was down as she wrote furiously on a legal pad , and when I hailed her , she looked up , smiled abstractedly , and returned to her writing . Her industry seemed a reprimand . I DID N'T GIVE UP , did n't let nature win the game in the first encounter . Every day I would arise , drink my coffee in the kitchen , kiss Audrey on her forehead  --  there was something endearing in her eyebrowless state , a subtext speaking volumes on humanity 's restless experimental spirit  --  and I would set off into the wilderness . I grew comfortable with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by birds or apt to let mud demoralize and defeat me . I sprayed myself with liberal amounts of insect repellant - Audrey said I smelled like poisonous oranges , even after a shower - and the hordes of hovering midges , mosquitoes , and gnats kept their distance . I grew less fastidious . My gag reflex relented . I could pick a tick off my sleeve with nonchalance and expertly crush it between my fingernails , flicking it away . If I thought that the blood on my fingers might be my own , siphoned from me by the creature , I felt only a satisfied sense of revenge , no horror-induced queasiness . But I was troubled . Despite this new ease , I found no subject for my essay , nothing that spoke my name . I began to have doubts that I ever would , and I was trying to escape an unsettling conclusion : Nature was boring . Turtles sat on logs soaking up the rays of the sun , as listless and devoid of interest as a pile of dirty socks . They 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurl rocks at them until they showed some life by flopping into the pond and disappearing . And that , in itself , was n't wildly entertaining . Nature 's infinite variety was beginning to look like a rut . If you thought about it , even the seasons , rolling around every year in the same damned order ( spring , summer , fall , winter , spring , summer , fall , winter ) , suggested a dearth of imagination . The pond was stupefied with routine . Fish endlessly rose to dimple the pond 's demeanor while small , sunflower-seed creatures with wire-thin legs skipped pointlessly across the water 's surface . Bugs whirred over the weeds ; small round birds darted down from the willow trees to eat them again and again and again . I was n't ready to give up , but I was having my doubts , my crisis of faith . I decided that the woods , still unexplored , might be my salvation . I had been reluctant to enter the woods . There is a primal fear of nature when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where only the lost find themselves . Who would seek it out ? The night I resolved to enter the woods the next morning was the same night that Audrey shared several pages of her manuscript with me . She was burning with the fever of creation , moving around the living room as she read , gesturing dramatically with her free hand . Her hair , cropped short with a scissors and wild abandon , was a red , spiky flag of rebellion that would have won my heart had she not already owned it . It became apparent , as Audrey read these fresh pages , that her physical appearance did n't mark the full extent of her experimentation . She had discovered a new approach to the memoir , a surreal language that captured the dissociative state produced by abuse . I confess I could n't follow it all . I did not recognize all of the words ( Latin ? Joycean synthesis ? ) and the narrative was disjointed . As soon as Audrey finished reading , she flopped down on the sofa and began writing furiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't disturb her or try to take the loose pages from her so that I could conduct a more careful reading . I doubt she would have let me . She almost never relinquished a work-in-progress for my scrutiny . I got up and went into the study where I wrote down the sentence that I had committed to memory , but even as I wrote the words , I distrusted their accuracy . This is what I wrote : " My brood brother committed the sin of threes and had no smoothness so that I wished he had splintered into hoosith hostoth ? and I was shamed by my parent wheel and uttered an asymmetrical harmony that generated sadness back to the last falofath ? where the latent ones hooted and sent their sound-scents throughout the burrow . " You can understand why I ca n't vouch for the accuracy of my transcription . But I think that does capture the tone . I set out with a will the next morning , spurred on by a new competitive spirit . I did n't want Audrey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free end of the string around the trunk of a tree and let the ball unravel as I entered the woods , stepping gingerly over logs and avoiding the larger , more formidable clumps of vegetation . Far from the menace I had imagined , I felt an immediate sense of serenity . Light fell through the overhead canopy of leaves , dappling the mossy ground with green , shifting shapes . Aside from a few birds scraping around in the bushes and the faraway chattering of an insect or bird or frog , there was a sweet , almost reverent hush . I inhaled the rich scent of earthy decay and the green life that fed on it . I was pleased with myself for thinking up the ball-of-twine trick . I could simply follow the string back , winding it around the cardboard core as it returned me to the meadow . I had several balls of string , so I could easily extend my range by tying the end of one to the beginning of the next . And , as a failsafe measure , I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march east for less than a mile and discover the dirt road that ran parallel to my property and that would lead me back to my house . I expected that days , perhaps weeks , would be needed to scout these woods as methodically as I had explored the pond and meadow , but on my first day I found the creek and , following it northward , encountered a clearing and the creatures that were to be my subject , creatures so fascinating , so complex in their behavior , that they promised a whole book of essays . I had come upon the clearing at midday , stepping into full sunlight from under the arch of a fallen tree , dazed , delighted , charmed . My creek , which had seemed , in the shadow of the forest , rather too dark and slippery for close inspection , was transformed . Now as lively and lovely as something from a fairy tale , it ran glittering through the middle of this verdant swale . I proceeded to unpack my lunch and eat it , sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed by my meadow and its forlorn pond , I had lowered my expectations , and this clearing , with its picture-book beauty , was a fine surprise , a reward , perhaps , for pushing on . I quoted Rilke to the air : " The earth is like a child that knows poems . " While eating my lunch , I became aware of a steady low drone that filled the air . The sound was like nothing I had heard before . Most of nature 's noises confirmed my belief that nature was just going through the motions : the repetitive Whatever , Whatever , Whatever of a bird that had lost its mind or the mechanical buzz of thousands of insects in thrall to a numbing need to procreate . But the sound that filled my ears in that clearing carried a profound emotional content , as though all the inhabitants of a great monastery were mourning the loss of paradise . ON FINISHING my lunch , I wadded up the paper bag and thrust it into my backpack . In my forays into the wilds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflexive . I am sure no author of nature essays litters . I had the instincts for my calling . I now employed those instincts to locate this poignant chant that so intrigued me . At first the sound seemed generalized , permeating the air , but I determined that it came from the creek , more specifically from that portion of the creek that disappeared into a thicket of squat shrubs and crooked trees brandishing new , pale  --  green leaves . Carefully , not wishing to make any disturbance that would alert the maker of the sound , I pushed through thorny underbrush , crawling on my hands and knees like a soldier behind enemy lines . I could not have come upon them from a better angle had I planned it knowing their location . I peered from behind a screen of leafy vines and was rewarded with my first view of the crayfish , perhaps fifteen of them scurrying in and out of their burrows on the opposite bank . I did not know , then , that they were crayfish . Later that evening I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harry taught biology at Clayton and had been doing so for many decades . I caught him at home , and he was in a hurry to get back to his bridge game where the possibilities for a grand slam invested his voice with an excitement I had never heard before ( dear God , how our lives narrow in the home stretch ) . I described the creatures and would have supplied what I knew of their habits from this first encounter , but Harry cut me off . " They 're not insects , " he said . " They are crustaceans , crayfish . That 's the only freshwater animal that fits your description . That armor you are describing is an exoskeleton . The - " I could hear someone hollering in the background , a shrill female voice that I recognized as belonging to old Dean Winfrey Podner , a lesbian according to student legend , which I found fanciful , for it required thinking of the dean in sexual terms . " Look , I 've got to go , " he said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retreating only when I became aware of the sinking sun and realized I 'd be making my way through the woods in the dark if I did n't call it a day . Those hours of observation on that first day were strewn with epiphanies . My Muse hugged herself for joy and sang within my head . The sad hum that filled the air was clearly generated by the crayfish who vibrated in a minor key as they scuttled over the bare clay soil , diving into holes in the bank , leaping in and out of the bright water of the stream . Sometimes two crayfish would encounter each other , hug , their bodies shivering more rapidly while their antennae waved wildly . Whether this entwining was sexual or served some other function , I could n't determine . Later I learned that this activity had to do with enlisting other members in what I came to call a meld , intending to seek out the proper term at a later date . Before leaping into the water , the crayfish would remove parts of their armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white as toothpaste , that boiled with tiny tentacles . I would have liked to discuss this removable exoskeleton with Harry and would have broached the subject on the phone had his manner been less abrupt . Was this common to crustaceans , this ability to doff their exoskeletons ? I was almost certain that other creatures could n't do this . Turtles could n't shed their shells and snails ... well , maybe snails could . I mean , that 's what slugs are , right ? That evening , when I arrived home , I found Audrey working zealously in the neglected vegetable garden by the side of the house . Neither of us had ever thought to resuscitate this garden , had n't spoken of it . Audrey did n't like gardens of any kind and had hinted at unpleasant experiences with vegetables in her past , but that evening her face was streaked with black dirt , and her shaved head shone with honest sweat - so few women have the bone structure to carry off a shorn look ; Audrey-does - and she smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done and , turning away , hefted her hoe again and had at the weeds . I did n't tell her about my crayfish . I wanted to surprise her with the essay . I entered the house and went straight for the kitchen where I grabbed an apple and a box of crackers . Then it was off to the study and to work . I began my essay : We are human and we think in human terms . Draw a line from a stone to a star , from a dinosaur bone to a dead ant , and wherever the lines intersect , there lies the human heart . Are we hopelessly self  --  referential or does the world truly speak to us ? It is easy to relate to those clear similarities , those echoes of our own mortal condition . The gorilla in his cage induces guilt when we look into his eyes . We see ourselves . The dead raccoon induces the same guilt when , at the wheels of our automobiles , we speed past its carcass , tossed negligently to the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what of smaller , more elusive creatures whose suffering is largely hidden from us ? What of the low moan of little things ? Can that really be grief we hear or is it an accident , harmonies with another purpose that fall upon our human ears and take the shape of sadness ? I speak of the lonesome song of the crayfish , that song that the wind carries to us , that sound that seems encoded with loss and despair . I was very pleased with that beginning , so pleased that I could n't continue . Art should never be hurried , particularly the essay with its obligatory andante . Besides , I needed more familiarity with my subject , more detail to support my reflective voice . As the weeks went by I was reminded of the danger of confusing the metaphor with what it illustrates . I was so fascinated by these crayfish that I often lost the essayist in the amateur naturalist . But I think I always regained the higher ground , and , in all humility , I think these passages demonstrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelves or nines , more rarely in sixes , I am always amazed at how they fold into a completely new organism . The mega-crayfish seems to defy its origins , to heroically turn its back on the past . Single crayfish eat their exoskeletons before the meld , knowing there is no going back , demonstrating a selflessness that human societies might find admirable . The first time I observed a mega-crayfish I had come upon it after the meld . I thought I was seeing a different animal entirely , although not one I was familiar with . The mega-crayfish comes in a variety of shapes , and this one looked something like a cat-sized spider except that it had a great many more legs than a spider and moved by collapsing a number of legs and falling in that direction , creating an odd , rollicking form of locomotion . This one dove into the water and returned with a frog which , I assumed , it was going to eat . Instead , it took the frog apart , peeling the skin back and plucking out various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was unpleasant to watch , since the frog continued to struggle throughout the operation , and the mega-crayfish performed the dissection with slow , finicky care . I expected the waiting crayfish to devour the morsels they had received from the mega-crayfish , and perhaps they did , but they did this out of my sight , disappearing into their holes with their treasures . After the skeleton had been dismantled and carried away , when the frog was nothing more than a sheath of mottled skin , the mega  --  crayfish offered this last remnant to the last waiting crayfish , who took the skin , donned it like a Halloween cape , and dashed toward his hole with a fleetness that seemed powered by joy . And then , of course , the mega-crayfish dismantled itself , pinching off its legs , unraveling its innards , and collapsing , finally , in a rubble of black exoskeleton , yellow blood and emerald guts . I expect this ritual has been observed by countless generations of country boys who give it no more thought than they might give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sister 's hair , but I must say , coming upon this gruesome spectacle with no warning of what was about to occur ... it was unsettling , to say the least . Perhaps it was the mega-crayfish 's nature to tear itself apart ; perhaps it was born to dissect and , lacking a subject , dissected itself . The analogy is easy , almost too easy : We human creatures deconstruct the universe and are left in the rubble of our fears , our mortality , our rags of faith . I was pleased with that passage , and if Audrey had seen me at that moment , she might have said , as was her wont , " You look like you 've just won the lottery . " But Audrey was nowhere around . She was probably upstairs reading in bed . I went outside and sat in the rocking chair and looked at the stars ( Hopkins 's " fire-folk sitting in the air " ) and thought that there were a lot of them in Pennsylvania , and I thought about how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have to hire security guards or at least get a dog although I was n't sure about getting a fierce dog because what if it began looking at me funny , started growling deep in its throat ? I sent the future marching took a deep breath and rocked in the moment . I noticed that the night was very still . All the world 's raucous frogs were silent , not a peep . AS THE DAYS continued to pass , the exploits of my crayfish kept feeding my essay , and it grew to an unwieldy size . It was beginning to show its ignorance , by which I mean that my lack of scientific knowledge regarding these crustaceans was becoming a problem . No doubt there was a scientific term for what I called a meld . And what was occurring when two crayfish fought and the loser erupted in flames ? The power of the image suggested a host of wonderful references throughout history and literature , but if I knew the mechanism - some volatile chemical released in defeat ? - I could speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to the heart of the matter . I needed to read up on crayfish . My decision was made on a Thursday evening after dinner . Scanning the phone book , which contained four counties and was still thinner than a copy of The New Yorker , I discovered - I confess I was surprised - a library in our very town . I thought it might still be open . The parking lot was empty and dark , and the library , a small , shedlike building &; appeared abandoned , although a closer inspection revealed a pale gleam of yellow light edging from beneath the window 's drawn shade . I went to the door , turned the knob , and entered . An elderly woman sitting behind her desk jerked her head up as though she had been caught dozing . " I can summon the police with a touch of a button , young man . There 's nothing here but library fines , less than five dollars , not worth the loss of your freedom and good name . " I told her that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who eat them , " she said . Being a librarian , I suppose she felt obligated to contribute her knowledge on the subject . " Not me , " I said and waited for her to help with the search . She returned with two books , one entitled , The Flora and Fauna of Western Pennsylvania and the other a children 's book entitled What 's Under That Rock ? I checked out both books after filling out a library card application that was three pages long and expected me to know things like my mother 's maiden name . I lied and got through it and made off with the books . I intended to retire to the study and read these books immediately , but I saw the message light on the answering machine blinking , and so I pushed the play button and Audrey 's voice jumped out . " Jonathan ! When you get this , I 'll be on my way to the coast with Dr. Bath and his wife . The quantum actualization of the brood wheel has come to us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so we are on our way . These other manifestations are important , but they are not the blooming . You can be of use where you are . Please tend to my garden . We will meet again in celebration and the making of fine multiples . " I went into the kitchen , fumbled in the cupboards , and found the bottle of Gilbey 's gin . It was my fault she 'd left . I 'd been neglecting her , lost in my damned essay about those damned crayfish . Neglected , she had fled into a crackpot religion . I should have seen it coming ; the signs were there . I mixed the gin with a lemony diet drink that tasted awful . That was fine ; I deserved it . Later I walked out into the yard and through the meadow and into the woods . I carried a flashlight and my backpack and trusted the familiarity of the route . There was a full moon , and I was drunk enough to fear no night thing . I entered the clearing without incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a resilient sapling caught my leg and threw me to the ground . I turned my flashlight , and the beam revealed a silver rod growing out of the grass . I reached forward and touched the rod and as I gripped it , it began to slide down into itself . This was n't at all like a sapling , and I studied the rod , pulling it up and then forcing it down again . It was a telescoping antenna . I retrieved my spade from the backpack and dug around the antenna , striking something hard . I brushed away the dirt to reveal a flat metal surface just under the ground . It took me well over two hours to unearth most of the truck 's cab . The cab was full of dirt - and Bob . There was black dirt in Bob 's mouth , black dirt in his eye sockets . His hands still clutched the wheel , ready to go but ... You lost the war , I thought , a stupid thought . I was feeling a little ill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass which grew undisturbed over what had to be the larger bulk of the truck . How did you get there , Bob ? I heard the new sound , a sound that did not resonate with loss but seemed joyous , playful , exuberant . I crawled into the thicket and took my station . The full moon provided more than enough illumination , but I could have seen them without it , for each crayfish was enveloped in a pale green glow . They were running in and out of a fine spray of mist , for all the world like children squealing and frolicking in the spray of a hose or water sprinkler . I recognized the source of the spray , Bob 's deadly canister of poison . Three of the crayfish operated it from its dug-in position high in the bank , while a dozen or more raced in and out of the toxic mist . As always , I was entranced , and I might have crouched there watching them for hours , but something moved behind them , a shadow that shifted and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart with terror . I scrambled out of the thicket , stood upright , and ran . I stumbled through the woods , crashing into trees , toppling over logs , but always up again and moving . The meadow left me unprotected ; I imagined malevolent eyes watching me from above . I ran . I reached the porch as my stomach cramped . I eased myself down on the first porch step and blinked at the silvered grass , the meadow and the trees beyond . The spinning world wobbled to a stop as I caught my breath . Peace reigned ; the stars were noncommittal and the breeze was warm and quick with the promise of spring . I glanced down at Audrey 's garden and thought of going after her , but Audrey would n't like that . No , time would have to bring her back to me ... the fullness of time ( a phrase that seemed suddenly sinister ; I saw this monstrous thing , bloated with the eons it had devoured ) . No going after Audrey . Had n't she charged me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains with this project , covering the ground with plastic sheets to protect the new shoots from the vicissitudes of the season . I stood up and regarded one of the sheets . I looked over my shoulder , but nothing was coming . I knelt down and peeled back the sheet and saw rows of neatly ordered little plants , white buds with blue .... No . My mind was forced to swallow the image , but it had no response ready  --  made . Indeed , my first reaction was to laugh abruptly , which really was n't appropriate . What I saw were rows of little blue eyeballs , naked , unblinking , incredulous . I had never seen a garden that looked so very , very surprised . I had no time to pursue that thought , for I turned again , prompted by a trumpeting roar that rattled my heart in its cage . The thing was silhouetted against the moon , its ragged wings outstretched , strange tentacles dangling from its black bulk , tentacles long enough to trail across the meadow as though trolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , devising a plan or preparing to devise a plan or , perhaps , simply eating this bag of potato chips and reading . When all is said and done , I enjoy reading far more than writing . Not that I 'm very fond of The Flora and Fauna of Western Pennsylvania . It has no pictures and it has that shiny paper that I associate with text books and the prose is almost impenetrable , and you know what ? I 'm an adult , and I do n't have to read it if I do n't want to . Hah . Well , What 's Under That Rock ? is a great improvement . For one thing , it has pictures . A picture is worth a thousand words . There 's a picture of a crayfish in this book . Something is on the roof ... make that in the attic . The noise does n't conjure a clear picture in my mind . Visualize a half dozen sailors , brawling while someone tortures a pig . No . I think you have to be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this drawing of a crayfish . Cambarus bartoni , that 's its scientific name . It looks exactly like a tiny lobster . That 's simple enough , is n't it ? I mean , what kind of genius do you have to be to say , " Jonathan , those are n't crayfish . I do n't know what the hell they are , but they are n't crayfish . Crayfish look exactly like small lobsters " ? Is that so difficult ? Thanks a lot , Harry Ackermann . I hope your grand slam fizzled . " When sorrows come , they come not single spies , but in battalions . " You are so right , Will . I 'm just sick , really sick and disgusted . And the essay is ruined , of course .
