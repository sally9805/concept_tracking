<p> Two years ago , as the U.S. Ryder Cup team was preparing to depart the media center following its final postmatch news conference at Oakland Hills Country Club in suburban Detroit , Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods proved prophetic as they offered the last words on an unfathomable 181/2-to-91/2 drubbing by Europe . <p> " I do n't think we 'll be the favorite the next time , " Mickelson said , quite somberly . " No matter what the world rankings say , I think we 'll be the underdog , and hopefully , we 'll play like they have . " <p> " There you go , " Woods added . " Why do n't you market us as the underdog ? " <p> " Starting now ? " someone asked him . <p> " Start now , " Woods said . " Perfect . " <p> With the 36th Ryder Cup set to begin Friday at the K Club outside Dublin , in what is being billed as the greatest sports event in Ireland 's history , no marketing seems necessary . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history also was their second straight to the Europeans , the fourth in the past five matches and the seventh time in the previous 10 that Europe had taken home the Cup . The U.S. team , with far more players ranked among the world 's top 25 players in each of those events , had been considered the favorite in each loss . Only a miraculous Sunday comeback at The Country Club in Brookline , Mass. , in 1999  --  the greatest rally in the history of the Cup  --  prevented what now would be a run of five straight European victories . <p> Theories abound as to why Europe has been so successful in recent years , when its teams never have been close to matching the Americans in star power , career earnings or major championships . <p> Some say the Europeans have better bonding and camaraderie in the team room . Others believe they revel in their underdog status and take immense pleasure in knocking off the millionaires from the far more prosperous PGA Tour . Others point out that the competition offers a chance for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a career , for themselves on one of the game 's biggest stages . <p> " I do n't think anyone believes the Americans do n't think the Ryder Cup is important or do n't take it seriously , but I really do believe the Europeans think it 's more important and they do take it more seriously , " said CBS golf analyst Peter Kostis , a widely respected U.S. golf instructor who counts among his students European player Paul Casey . <p> " I often Google my students and myself , and 95 percent of the stories written about Paul will always say ' Paul Casey , European Ryder Cupper , ' or ' Paul Casey , a member of the winning Ryder Cup team , ' or ' Paul Casey , a prospective member of the 2006 Ryder Cup team . ' For two years , it 's regurgitated by the media over there , and it goes for every guy who played on the team , or might play on the next team . The players all see it , too , and it has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the Americans do n't seem to care enough because they think me-first instead of team-first . How else to explain Woods 's 7-11-2 Ryder Cup record , the only blemish on his otherwise breathtaking rsum ? And if Mickelson cared so much , why would he change equipment manufacturers only weeks before the 2004 matches , only to lose three of his four matches , two of them when partnered with Woods ? <p> Others also wonder if the PGA Tour 's Presidents Cup , a similar match-play event between a U.S. team and an international squad , conducted in the Ryder Cup off year , has also hurt U.S. chances in the Ryder Cup . <p> " The Americans are now facing that kind of pressure every year , " Kostis said . " Unlike the Europeans , they do n't have a full two years to get motivated for the Ryder Cup and to build their enthusiasm for it . It 's a distinct disadvantage to our guys to have to play in that kind of atmosphere every year . " <p> Over the past two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasized to his players the importance of the main task at hand : hitting fairways and greens , making putts and winning matches . <p> Since being named captain , he 's constantly preached to his 12 players the importance of having fun , instead of playing scared to lose . He says he 'll encourage his players to talk about their fears and their anxieties in team sessions before the matches , the better to lessen the tension he knows all of them will feel , from No. 1 Woods down to the four rookies on the team . <p> " I think we need to go into it this year with a ' what do we have to lose ' attitude , " said Stewart Cink , one of Lehman 's two captain 's choice picks . " The last couple of Ryder Cups , it seems like everyone thinks we had everything to lose . This year , I do n't think we have anywhere to go but up because on paper , we 're the number one team in this deal . " <p> Lehman said his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a tremendous opportunity to go to a place we 've never gone to before , to play in Ireland for the first time in front of an incredible crowd . We have a chance to go there and do something special . " <p> So far , his team appears to have bought in to his captaincy . Over the last year , he has made hundreds of phone calls and written countless notes of encouragement to potential team members . He has had productive , one-on-one sessions with all of his top stars , including Woods , who is emerging as a genuine team leader in his fifth Cup appearance . <p> During the World Golf Championship event in Akron last month , Woods took the four rookies on the team out to dinner , the better to get to know them . Three weeks ago , Lehman , his assistant captains , all 12 team members and their caddies went to the K Club for two days of practice , fishing and frat-house bonding , a first for any American Cup team . Lehman also dismisses any notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europeans play better golf through better team chemistry . <p> " I definitely do n't buy into that argument , " he said . " I think there 's more conflict , or maybe more on the European team than there is on the American side , " he said . " I 'm sure they have their own issues . I do n't see camaraderie being an issue . I think the guys on our team are pretty close . " <p> Lehman also is reveling in his team 's clear underdog status , especially with four rookies on the squad , two more than on the European side . And though the Americans will have to top three players in the world  --  No. 1 Woods , No. 2 Jim Furyk and No. 3 Mickelson  --  Lehman has other numbers to support his long-shot claims . <p> While Europe has just two players in the top 10  --  Sergio Garcia at No. 8 and Luke Donald at No. 10  --  it has seven in the top 20 , one more than the U.S. side . The Europeans also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cup veterans , compared to 20 among the eight Americans who have competed in past events . Seven European players have winning Cup records , and the other three are .500 . The Americans have only four veterans with winning records . Overall , the Europeans are 75-42-21 in Cup competition ; the Americans are 31-39-10 . <p> Add in the home sod advantage , and Europe appropriately will be favored . <p> " I firmly believe it 's a good thing to have a competitive chip on your shoulder , " Lehman said . " These rookies feel like they have something to prove . If you think there are detractors who do n't think you belong there , well , I felt that way when I first got here . You do n't think I belong ? Well I 'll show you . That 's not a bad way to approach it . " <p> Lehman also knows that in the final analysis , the team that hits the finest shots , makes the most putts and plays the best golf overall will surely prevail . <p> " Second-guessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply a waste of time , " he said . " Every person I 've talked to all takes it extremely seriously and has wanted to win the Cup with all their heart . Our guys are sick and tired of losing . They 're sick and tired of hearing they 're not together as a team , that they do n't get along . I think you 're going to see a committed group of guys in Ireland . <p> " It simply comes down to the fact of who has played the better golf that week , and the Europeans have definitely done that .
