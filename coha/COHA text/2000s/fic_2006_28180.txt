Chapter One THE TAR ROAD Boys stand with road-sore feet holding cardboard suitcases . They stand clustered , but not in a group . They 're not together . They do n't talk into the wind ; they only wait on the brake lights that so rarely happen . Still , every new car or bakkie or combi or lorry is a new hope , rising and dying like a beating heart glowing and then spending itself on the pavement , only to live again when the next one comes . Out there in their best clothes , trying to get to the school deep in the veld . At certain moments in the early afternoon the tar road looks like it 's burning . A boy kneels and sniffs . There 's always one who thinks he can tell how much longer it will be by smelling the road . " Stupid , " another says . " Not stupid , science . It 's about air currents near the pavement 's surface . They change when - " " Ai , go on . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you do n't want to pull out food , because no one would want to be caught chewing if the miracle of car does stop . Imagine a comfortable ride in a bucket seat with the radio playing . They keep their bread in their pockets . Boys have it worst . They are chosen last , after old mammies , mothers with babies , old men . Most of the time their only option is a lorry.Lorries do n't stop , they only slow down , just long enough for the boys to toss their bundles and leap , before the driver shifts gears and accelerates again . Klim op ! Then they huddle against each other in the wind and wait for it to be over , as the lorry gains speed and begins to cross bridge after bridge over the dry rivers .
