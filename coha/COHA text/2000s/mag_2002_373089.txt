Weary of commercial travel but ca n't afford a private jet ? There 's a new option . Last week Lufthansa began operating an all-business-class flight from Newark International Airport to Dusseldorf , Germany , using planes and crew from the elite Swiss charter company PrivatAir . Passengers at each airport will be escorted through security by an airline agent and then board from a gate next to Lufthansa 's club lounge . The Boeing business jet will have 48 big seats , each with a Sony Watchman . There will be plainclothes security officers onboard and a flight attendant for every 12 passengers . Price : $5,813 round trip , compared with $5,906 for regular business class . If the concept flies , similar services may be offered elsewhere . PrivatAir is in discussions with two North American carriers . <P>  --  By Sally B. Donnelly
