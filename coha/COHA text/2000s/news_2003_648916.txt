<p> It had been a rough night for the young Earl Boykins . A few of his ill-timederrors in a recreation-league basketball game had cost his and his father 's team a victory . Never mind that at 12 , he was the only preteen in the mostly adult league , or that he was well below 5 feet tall . None of that mattered to Willie Williams , who scolded his son harshly . <p> " He was all over me , " Boykins , now a backup point guard for the Denver Nuggets , recalled . " I wanted to say : ' I 'm only 12 . What did you expect ? ' But he taught me that the only thing that matters is winning . " <p> On an individual level , the 5-foot-5 Boykins has won , overcoming at age 27 the N.B.A. 's bias against small players and his journeyman 's status for the past five years . <p> After stints with the Nets , the Cleveland Cavaliers , the Orlando Magic , the Los Angeles Clippers and the Golden State Warriors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver before this season . Early indications are that he may be a steal . <p> Boykins is Denver 's second-leading scorer ( 14.5 points a game ) , behind Carmelo Anthony ( 16.5 ) , despite playing only 25.5 minutes a game . Before the Nuggets played at Cleveland on Wednesday , Anthony called Boykins " instant offense , " a description that was far more accurate than Anthony 's jump shot that night . <p> While 20,562 fans at Gund Arena and a national television audience stared at the rookies Anthony and LeBron James of Cleveland , Boykins scored a team-high 18 points in 17 second-half minutes , wowing the crowd in his hometown . That stirring performance came less than 24 hours after Boykins scored 18 of Denver 's 60 points in a loss at Indiana . <p> " He is a scoring guard , " said John MacLeod , an N.B.A. coach for 18 years and now the Nuggets ' associate coach . " He 's a little bullet . He can break the defense down . He 's got 3-point range . He likes to score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good passer and rarely one to turn the ball over , Boykins is indeed more of a scorer than a setup man . MacLeod rated him right behind the 5-9 Calvin Murphy among the greatest small players , but Boykins will have to excel for several more years to reach the status of Spud Webb and Muggsy Bogues , the truest point guard of the sub-5-10 players . <p> The 133-pound Boykins honed his game by playing games with his father and other adults in Cleveland , so scoring over bigger opponents is second nature to him . That background also helps him on defense , where his unusual strength  --  he bench-presses 300 pounds  --  makes it difficult for some point guards to post him up . Furthermore , if opponents spend too much time trying to post their point guards against Boykins , they disrupt their offense . <p> " I was always playing with grown men , so I began to view the game not from a kid 's perspective but as an adult , " Boykins said . " The guys were always bigger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that standpoint because when you 're a kid playing against grown men , the first thing they do is try to get physical with you . So now I 'm used to it . It 's like normal . " <p> A few of the teams that released Boykins could use him now . Cleveland has James playing point guard , but many would prefer Boykins over the Cavaliers ' usual playmakers , Kevin Ollie and J. R. Bremer , and Orlando is sputtering along with Tyronn Lue and Shammond Williams running the offense . <p> While other clubs showed only mild interest in Boykins last summer , Denver was aggressive from the start . The Nuggets remembered how Boykins recorded 20 points and a career-high 7 steals against them in a Warriors victory last season . <p> " He tattooed us every time we played them , " MacLeod said . " I think a lot of times in the N.B.A. we think , ' Ah , he 's too small . ' But not this little guy . This little guy 's got a great heart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams , and he said his outstanding performance in Cleveland had nothing to do with playing at home or against a former employer . <p> " I always play with a chip on my shoulder , but not because other teams have passed me by , " Boykins said . " That 's just the way I am . It 's never personal . My goal is to win . I 've always felt that wherever I was , if I got the opportunity , I would win . " <p> Asked before the Cleveland game if the Nuggets could win on a regular basis , Boykins said : " We 're going to win . How soon ? We 'll win tonight . " <p> He made sure of that . <p> Randolph No Longer Unknown <p> Three years ago , the Portland Trail Blazers parted with a gem because they lacked foresight . Unaware of what Jermaine O'Neal could become , the Blazers traded him to Indiana for Dale Davis . After sitting on the bench for four years in Portland , O'Neal became a star for the Pacers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game the past two seasons . <p> Imagine O'Neal playing next to Rasheed Wallace and Zach Randolph this season . That would make the Blazers a contender in the West . The only consolation for the Blazers is that they have avoided making the same mistake with the 22-year-old Randolph . <p> The early career of Randolph , a 6-9 power forward , was following the same path as O'Neal 's . <p> After leaving Michigan State as a freshman , Randolph played sparingly as a rookie , and he was still being brought along slowly last season until Wallace was suspended for seven games after a run-in with some referees . <p> Moved into the starting lineup , Randolph blossomed , displaying tenacity on the offensive boards and strong scoring ability inside . When Wallace returned , Randolph , playing for the injured Davis , started four games beside him in the playoffs . Portland won three of those games to push Dallas to the limit in a first-round loss . <p> This season , the Blazers decided to move the perimeter-loving Wallace to small forward so Randolph could start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Randolph 's rookie contract , making him a Blazer for this season and the next . Randolph has not disappointed , averaging team highs of 18.6 points and 11.6 rebounds . <p> " Randolph played by accident , " said John Nash , the Blazers ' first-year general manager . " If it had not been for Rasheed Wallace 's suspension , he might still be an unknown . Now he 'll be an All-Star . The only thing that could keep him out is that there are so many great power forwards in the West . " <p> Thanks to the Blazers , at least one of those , O'Neal , is in the East . <p> Lewis Showing What He Learned <p> Last week , Seattle 's Rashard Lewis became the fourth high-school-to-pros player to score 50 points or more in a game , joining the illustrious company of Kobe Bryant , Tracy McGrady and Moses Malone . <p> Lewis 's 50-point effort against the Los Angeles Clippers came on the heels of a 25-point season opener , giving SuperSonics fans a reason to smile in the post-Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an All-Star , " Seattle 's president , Wally Walker , said . " And he certainly has the work ethic and the talent to do that . " <p> Many had not been so sure . On the night of the 1998 draft , Lewis , a 6-10 forward out of Texas , wept on national television as teams bypassed him . Eventually , Seattle grabbed him in the second round ( 32nd over all ) . <p> With his college eligibility gone and his professional career up in the air , Lewis became Exhibit A for why N.B.A. hopefulsshould go to college first . Lewis did little to dispel that impression as a rookie and during the subsequent off-season , when he looked afraid and overmatched in the Boston Summer League . <p> Walker , who has since signed Lewis to a lucrative long-term contract , admits that even he had his doubts at that point . <p> " He was such a quiet and shy kid when we got him that you wondered if he would ever be assertive enough to be a star player in the N.B.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> What Lewis lacked in confidence , he made up for by listening , soaking in coaches ' advice like a sponge . Soon he became more aggressive and deferred less to teammates . He added a post game in the summer of 2002 and improved his ball-handling last summer . <p> Now he is a nightmarish matchup for opponents , capable of taking small forwards inside and power forwards to the perimeter , where he has excellent range from beyond the 3-point line . <p> Although he is a veteran of six seasons , Lewis is only 24 years old . <p> A Van Gundy Brothers ' Reunion <p> Jeff and Stan Van Gundy , only the second set of brothers to coach in the N.B.A. , will face off Tuesday when Stan 's Miami Heat visits Jeff 's Houston Rockets . <p> Larry and Herb Brown are the other set of coaching brothers . Herb coached Detroit from 1976-77 . <p> While Jeff 's Rockets are thriving , Stan , the elder by three years , has found the going tough with the Heat , losing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , 88-79 , to the Minnesota Timberwolves . <p> The poor start means that Stan 's first victory can come at the expense of his brother , whose Rockets are 4-1 . <p> Stan 's team is similar to the Knicks club his brother left in 2000 . Miami 's Lamar Odom is like Marcus Camby , a tantalizing talent who is physically fragile . Besides Odom , the Heat 's best players  --  Eddie Jones , Dwyane Wade and Caron Butler  --  essentially play the same position , as did Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell . Miami 's point guards ( Rafer Alston and Bimbo Coles ) make the Charlie Ward-Howard Eisley tandem look desirable , and Brian Grant is Kurt Thomas with dreadlocks . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
