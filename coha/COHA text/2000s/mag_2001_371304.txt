MISTY WATERCOLORED MEMORIES ... <P> So it 's the laughter we will remember . JOSH BROLIN , crinkle-eyed son of actor James Brolin , and MINNIE DRIVER , Good Will Hunting 's boisterous Brit , have split . After six months ' betrothal , plans for nuptials at the Malibu home of Josh 's father and stepmother Barbra  --  that would be Barbra Streisand  --  were shelved . The prospective mother-in-law , reports say , had written a song for the couple and was pushing favorite designer Donna Karan for Driver 's dress ( friends reportedly said that Driver preferred Vera Wang ) , along with a pricey celeb-studded bash , while Driver wanted something small . Smiles were left behind . Driver 's spokeswoman says that any rift between Babs and Minnie is untrue ; she adds that the breakup was " a mutual decision . " Ah , but in the spirit of that old song , if they had a chance to do it all again , tell me , would they ? Could they ? <P> Twist and Pout <P> CHUBBY CHECKER wants respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might go is city hall and revert to birth name Ernest Evans . But no . The Chubster is marching on a different hall : the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland , Ohio . As footloose popularizer of the Twist , Checker wants a statue of his likeness erected in the Hall of Fame 's courtyard for services to dancing . ( He also popularized the Fly , the Pony and the now legendary Hucklebuck . ) " This is Nobel Prize territory , " he insists . The quest came to him after an appearance on a sitcom . " A line in the script was ' I thought Chubby Checker was dead ! ' " he says . " It got me thinking . " Problem is , the singer , aerobic-tape shaker and Chubby Checker 's Beef Jerky maker has n't even been inducted yet , let alone invited to be immortally smelted . The Hall , not afraid of big personalities , calls his demand " unreasonable . " <P> BARRY BONDS CONNECTS WITH HISTORY <P> He 's been called aloof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if BARRY BONDS was excited about the personal race he was in , he kept it as low key as possible , putting the individual quest for history in second place to his team 's struggle to get into the play-offs . And on Friday night , the San Francisco Giant slugger did his part , hitting not one but two home runs during the longest nine-inning game in major league baseball history ( 4 hr. 27 min . ) . The first of those blasts ( photograph above ) broke the record of 70 set to much fanfare just three years ago by the Cardinals ' Mark McGwire . Bonds had already set a new record for walks ( overtaking the one set by Babe Ruth in 1923 ) earlier in the week . Bonds did n't much care for that record . But he did care that the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Giants by a score of 11-10 , taking San Francisco out of post-season play . For all his records , Bonds , 37 , has never been to a World Series  --  and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We knew what we were up against tonight , " he said after the game . " We knew we had to battle . We worked hard tonight . It 's just unfortunate they played better than us . " But he still made history , which even he admits is important . " People are excited about history , " he told the Associated Press . " Everyone wants to be a part of history , and you ca n't fault them for it . " Bonds celebrated his home-run record with his family , including daughter Aisha , above left . But he would rather be playing for a championship ring .
