OUR NO-FEAR GUIDE TO WEIGHT TRAINING SHOWS YOU HOW . // Joy Hayes is n't an especially religious woman , but to motivate her female athletes in the University of Kansas weight room , the strength coach often parapharases a Biblical passage from Proverbs 31 : " She builds up her arms with strength . " " I think it 's pretty cool that even the Bible says woman should have strong arms , And it really inspires them , " says Hayes , UK 's assistant director of strength/ conditioning . She 's always looking for ways to prompt women to lift weights . Some of her top tennis players and track athletes shy away from it because they 're unfamiliar with the equipment or afraid of bulking up . " They do n't know that many women bodybuilders train six hours a day and take supplements , " she says . These and other misconceptions lead many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes to design one that 's sure to give you the firm , sexy results you 're looking for . And this is it . This routine gives equal time to the upper and lower body . " Many women avoid training their upper body , " Hayes says , " but if you have scrawny shoulders and normal , woman-sized hips , your hips will look big . A wider chest , back and shoulders Will make your lower body appear leaner . " The routine also emphasizes multijoint exercises like squats and lunges , which many women avoid in favor of those that target individual muscle groups . These moves require more coordination than leg-curl or leg-extension machines but also save time by working several muscle groups at once . They 're more like movements we do in everyday activities . When doing this routine , do n't use dinky little dumbbells - another common mistake among women afraid of getting too big . Doing three sets of 10 repetitions wo n't transform you into Arnold Schwarzenegger . On the eighth , ninth and loth reps , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feel like , " Oh my gosh , I do n't know if I can finish this !
