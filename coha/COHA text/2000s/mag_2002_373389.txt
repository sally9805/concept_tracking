I probably should n't say this , but there is always the risk in preparing a big report on the environment that no one will read it . Not that people do n't care about the issues . But after years of listening to the debates , many of us suffer from " environment fatigue " : we get the big picture ( pollution bad , clean energy good ) but are frustrated that no one seems able to do much to help . <P> Well , my advice is to put aside your skepticism and give the Green Century report in this issue a close look . Prepared by Charles Alexander , who has edited TIME 's environmental specials for the past 13 years , the report is at its root a declaration of optimism . Yes , our planet is under siege from the combined pressures of air and water pollution , global warming and overpopulation . But new technologies , innovative , market-based incentives and a growing mainstream acceptance of green concerns offer hope that real progress is within reach . <P> In this issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us  --  corporate chiefs , subsistence farmers , environmental activists  --  would like to inhabit . Among the strategies : a new Industrial Revolution based on much more than just raw output , high-tech buildings that are environmentally savvy , incentives to speed the switch to clean energy sources , fast and safe cars that do n't pollute and innovative programs to keep the sprawling global village from swallowing our precious wilderness . " So much environmental reporting emphasizes only the problems , " says Alexander . " We wanted to focus on the solutions . " <P> Why now ? Starting on Aug. 26 , world leaders will convene in Johannesburg for 10 days to assess the state of the planet and chart a course of action . The focus will be on " sustainable development " : how to keep growing and lifting living standards without exhausting the globe 's natural resources . In an essay written for TIME , Kofi Annan , the U.N . Secretary-General , articulates a future that could be bright or disastrous , depending on the policies we adopt . <P> Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving tribute to the planet from former astronaut Kathryn Sullivan , who has seen Earth from a rare vantage point ; a cautionary tale of lost civilizations from Jared Diamond , Pulitzer prizewinning author and a director of the World Wildlife Fund ; and an impassioned call to action from Jane Goodall , the renowned conservationist . ( Goodall faxed her essay to us with apologies that she would n't be around for a while to answer editors ' questions . She was heading soon into a rain forest in the Republic of the Congo . ) <P> And while you 're at it , take a look at Andrew Goldstein 's provocative indictment of the green movement . Although environmentalists are doing good works , the tactics of certain radical groups not only are n't achieving results but , Goldstein argues , are probably causing more harm than good . <P> The project reflects the hard work of many TIME staff members , in particular Andrea Dorfman , who did much of the reporting and co-wrote the lead story ; Marti Golon , who created the striking design ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you tend to skip environmental specials , make an exception with this one . There 's a hopeful message inside that 's well worth your time . <P> Adi Ignatius , Executive Editor
