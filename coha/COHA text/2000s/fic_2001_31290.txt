The phone rang . It was 2:30 A.M. Normally I am a light sleeper , but that night I was down among the dead . I had just finished a thirteen-hour shift , my fourth day running of heavy overtime , and I had n't been sleeping well until tonight . A guy named Jackie Newton was haunting my dreams . He was my enemy and I thought that someday I would probably have to kill him . When the bell went off , I was dreaming about Jackie Newton and our final showdown . For some reason logic is never the strong point of a dream like that Jackie and I were in the hallway at East High School . The bell brought the kids out for the change of classes ; Jackie started shooting and the kids began to drop , and that bell kept ringing as if it could n't stop . In the bed beside me , Carol stirred . " Oh , Cliff , " she groaned . " Would somebody please get that goddamn telephone ? " I groped for the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to the floor . From some distant galaxy I could hear the midget voice of Neal Hennessey , saying , " Cliff ? ... Cliff ? ... Hey , Clifford ! " I reached along the black floor and found the phone , but it was still many seconds later before Hennessey took on his bearlike image in my mind . " Looks like we got another one , " Hennessey said without preamble . I struggled to sit up , trying to get used to the idea that Jackie Newton had n't shot me after all . " Hey , Cliffie ... you alive yet ? " " Yeah , Neal , sure . First time I been sound asleep in a week . " He did n't apologize ; he just waited . " Where you at ? " I said . " Alley off Fifteenth , just up from the Denver Post . This one looks an awful lot like the others . " " Give me about half an hour . " " We 'll be here . " I sat for another minute , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on the light and looked in the mirror and got the first terrifying look at myself in the cold hard light of the new day . You 're getting old , Janeway , I thought . Old Andrew Wyeth could make a masterpiece out of a face like that . Call it Clifford Liberty Janeway at thirty-six , with no blemish eliminated and no character line unexplored . I splashed cold water on my face : it had a great deal less character after that . To finally answer Hennessey , yes , I was almost alive again . The vision of Jackie Newton rose up before me and my hand went automatically to the white splash of scar tissue just under my right shoulder . A bank robber had shot me there five years ago . I knew Jackie Newton would give a lot to put in another one , about three inches to the left and an inch or so down . Man with an old bullet wound , by Wyeth : an atypical work , definitely not your garden-variety Helga picture . When I came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a cup of instant coffee steaming on my nightstand . " What now ? " she said . As I struggled into my clothes , I told her it looked like another derelict murder . She sighed loudly and sat on the bed . She was lovely even in a semistupor . She had long auburn hair and could probably double for Helga in a pinch . No one but Wyeth would know . " Would you like me to come with you ? " I gave a little laugh , blowing the steam from my coffee . " Call it moral support , " she said . " Just for the ride down and back . Nobody needs to see me . I could stay in the car . " " Somebody would see you , all right , and then the tongues would start . It 'd be all over the department by tomorrow . " " You know something ? I do n't even care . " " I care . What we do in our own time is nobody 's business . " I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there side by side the blue uniform Carol had worn on yesterday 's shift ; my dark sport coat ; our guns , which had become as much a part of the wardrobe as pants , shirts , ties , badges . I never went anywhere without mine , not even to the corner store . I had had a long career for a guy thirty-six : I 'd made my share of enemies , and Jackie Newton was only the latest . I put the gun on under my coat . I did n't wear a tie , was n't about to at that time of night . I was off duty and I 'd just been roused from a sound sleep ; I was n't running for city council , and I hated neckties . " I know you 've been saying that for a long time now , that stuff about privacy , " Carol said dreamily . " But I think the real reason is , if people know about me , I make you vulnerable . " I did n't want to get into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was something in what Carol said , but something in what I said too . I 've never liked office gossip , and I did n't want people talking about her and me . But Carol had been looking at it from another angle lately . We had been seeing each other , in the polite vernacular , for a year now , and she was starting to want something more permanent . Maybe bringing our arrangement into the public eye would show me how little there was to worry about . People did it all the time . For most of them the world did n't come to an end . Occasionally something good came out of it . So she thought . " I 'm going back to bed , " she said . " Wake me when you come in . Maybe I 'll have a nice surprise for you . " She lay back and closed her eyes . Her hair made a spectacular sunburst on the pillow . I sat for a while longer , sipping my coffee . There was n't any hurry : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd leave in five minutes and still be well within the half hour I 'd promised Hennessey . The trouble is , when I have dead time even five minutes unfilled in the middle of the night I begin to think . I think about Carol and me and all the days to come . I think about the job and all the burned-out gone-forever days behind us . I think about quitting and I wonder what I 'd do . I think about being tied to someone and anchoring those ties with children . Carol would not be a bad one to do that with . She 's pretty and bright , and maybe this is what love is . She 's good company : her interests broaden almost every day . She reads three books to my one , and I read a lot . We talk far into the night . She still does n't understand the first edition game : Hemingway , she says , reads just as well in a two-bit paperback as he does in a $500 first printing . I can still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only a fool would read a first edition . Simply having such a book makes life in general and Hemingway in particular go better when you do break out the reading copies . I listened to myself and thought , This woman must think I 'm a government-inspected horse 's ass . Then I showed her my Faulkners , one with a signature , and I saw her shiver with an almost sexual pleasure as she touched the paper where he 'd signed it . Faulkner was her most recent god , and I had managed to put together a small but respectable collection of his first editions . You 've got to read this stuff , she said to me when she was a month deep in his work . How can you collect the man without ever reading what he 's written ? In fact , I had read him , years ago : I never could get the viewpoints straight in The Sound and the Fury , but I had sense enough at sixteen to know that the problem was n't with Faulkner but with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again : if I began to collect him , I reasoned , I 'd have to read him sooner or later . Carol shook her head . Look at it this way , I said , the Faulkners have appreciated about twenty percent in the three years I 've owned them . That she understood . My apartment looked like an adjunct of the Denver Public Library . There were wall-to-wall books in every room . Carol had never asked the Big Dumb Question that people always ask when they come into a place like this : Jeez , d' ya read all these ? She browsed , fascinated . The books have a loose logic to their shelving : mysteries in the bedroom ; novels out here ; art books , notably by the Wyeths , on the far wall . There 's no discrimination they are all first editions and when people try to go highbrow on me , I love reminding them that my as-new copy of Raymond Chandler 's Lady in the Lake is worth a cool $1,000 today , more than a bale of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters of the art-and-beauty school . There 's nothing wrong with writing detective stories if you do it well enough . I 've been collecting books for a long time . Once I killed two men in the same day , and this room had an almost immediate healing effect . I 've missed my calling , I thought . But now was probably years too late to be thinking about it . Time to go . " Cliff ? " Her eyes were still closed , but she was not quite asleep . " I 'm leaving now , " I said . " You going out to see Jackie Newton ? " " If this is what it looks like , you better believe it . " " Have Neal watch your flank . And both of you be careful . " I went over and kissed her on the temple . Two minutes later I was in my car , gliding through the cool Denver night .
