Just the Facts My name , if you must know , is Franklin Delano Donuthead . Try saying that in a room full of fifth graders if you think names will never hurt you . The Donuthead part comes from way back , from my **35;585;TOOLONG who came to the United States during the famous turnip famine . Of course he did n't speak a lick of English . His Russian name was something like Donotscked . Somehow , when he came out of the ferry office at Ellis Island with a piece of paper in his hand , he was a Donuthead . So , basically , I come from a long line of suffering Russian Donutheads . All the suffering could have been avoided if it were n't for Washington Irving , this very famous writer who recorded the events of his life in his journal . One day , he wrote about these little balls of sweetened dough he liked fried up in hog fat . He called them dough nuts . Because , you see , the very first doughnuts were shaped like lumpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name the Dutch people gave them . They were the ones who created them , anyway . They called them olykoeks . If he had called them olykoeks , my life would have been very different , I assure you . Then again , with my luck , I would have been named Franklin Delano Olykoekhead . My mother is a major major fan of our thirty-second president . She likes to listen to the radio addresses that Franklin Delano Roosevelt gave when he came into office during the Great Depression . Believe it or not , she listens to them in her van during her workday . She has them all on tape . " If FDR could rise above a life-threatening illness to become president of the United States , then you should be able to rise above the curse of a name like Donuthead to at least play third base for the New York Yankees , " my mother says . I think this is very unfair . Your mother gives you a name when you 're all red and screaming and you have a pounding headache . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future " situation . Now that I am eleven , I have pretty much accepted my life . I 'm a Russian Donuthead who 's named after a great handicapped president . In some twisted way , this all makes sense . Because , you see , I too am handicapped . Yes , one side of my body is shorter than the other . My mother says this is my imagination , but I am here to tell you that a tape measure does not lie . " Maybe you 're just growing from side to side , " she says . " One side first and then the other . " While this may be possible , I think it 's highly unlikely . I have found no evidence to support this theory . Currently , there is an eight-tenths-of-an-inch difference between my left arm and my right arm , and a four-tenths-of-an-inch difference between my left leg and my right leg . Just yesterday , when I measured my legs after school , I found my toe creeping closer to the five . I am preparing myself mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different bodies . Both my left arm and my left leg are longer . At this rate , I 'm going to have to go to one of those special stores to be fitted for my Sunday suits . Soon , I 'll be buying shoes with one high heel . All my mother cares about is how this will affect my ability to play third base for the New York Yankees . I keep telling her that with my athletic ability , I 'd be lucky if they hired me to chalk out the field . I think it 's so pathetic how parents are always trying to transfer their dreams onto their kids . So far , I 've just focused on staying alive . If I did n't know there was an astonishingly high probability that I would live through each daygiven my age , general health , and relatively high standard of livingI would not get out of bed in the morning . I avoid motor vehicles whenever possible . According to the National Safety Department , this is by far the most likely way to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water ( drowning 's number two ) , and anything that would cause a death-inducing accident ( number three ) . This could be , oh , say , being hit in the temple by a hard grounder down the third base line . In addition , I never play with matches or firearms ; never climb trees , ladders , or fences ; change the smoke detector batteries every three months ; do not drink liquids that are stored under the sink or put any plastic bags over my head . Gloria Nelots , the chief statistician for the National Safety Department in Washington , has already offered me a job when I graduate from collegeif I should live that long . She and I talk at least once a week . Me : Good morning , Gloria . Gloria : What is it now , Franklin ? Me : My school is planning a field trip to a working farm . Gloria : And . . . Me : I was just wondering . . . what is the likelihood of me being crushed by a moving tractor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silo and suffocated by grain ? Gloria : They do n't make percentages that small . Me : Can mad cow disease be transmitted by saliva ? I mean , if a cow licks me , and . . . Gloria : Franklin , you would have to eat it , and since you never touch red meat . . . Me : Gloria , I think you should know our school bus does not have seat belts . Gloria : I 'll get someone on it right away , Franklin . Me : It 's Bus Number 987 in the Pelican View School District . In addition , I think the rear tires are overinflated , causing premature baldness . I was just wondering , Gloria . . . Gloria : You wo n't get a note from me , Franklin , if that 's what you 're angling for . I think it 's perfectly safe for you to go to the farm . Me : Well , obviously , I 'm concerned for the safety of all the students , not just myself . Recently , I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes untied . These are young children , Gloria . . . Gloria : Franklin ? Me : Yes ? Gloria : Do you ever think about girls ? Me : Girls , Gloria ? Gloria : I think it would be better for your health if you thought about girls rather than disasters . Stress plays a major role in the leading causes of death in this nation . Well , let me tell you , I did n't have anything to say to that . I just had to hang up right then . After all , Gloria is a girl . How could I tell her that girls filled me with so much stress they ought to come with warning labels ?
