<p> What is this thing called the Motley Fool ? Remember Shakespeare ? Remember " As You Like It " ? In Elizabethan days , fools were the only people who could get away with telling the truth to the king or queen . The Motley Fool tells the truth about investing and hopes you 'll laugh all the way to the bank . <p> FOOL 'S SCHOOL <p> LOTTERY ODDS <p> The odds of winning a Powerball jackpot are 1 in 146 million . ( The odds of winning just $3 are 1 in almost 70 . ) <p> It 's hard to comprehend how big a number 146 million is . Consider that it 's more than the populations of South Africa , Italy , Cambodia and Australia combined ( or more than the population of Russia ) . Imagine being with all those people in one room . Then imagine being the one person randomly selected out of all of them . <p> Also , 146 million is close to half of the population of the United States . The odds of winning the Powerball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the phone books from all 50 states . If you think you have a good chance of being one of those two people , then load up on lottery tickets . <p> Additionally , 146 million years ago was roughly the Jurassic period , when dinosaurs roamed the Earth . Mars is roughly 140 million miles from Earth . A typical number of hairs on a human head is about 100,000 . So to get to 146 million , imagine 1,460 people and then imagine choosing one hair on one of their heads . <p> Remember , lotteries do n't exist to reward gamblers ; they exist to raise revenues . From gamblers . Instead of dreaming about what you might get out of a lottery , think about what you 're putting into it . <p> Making the situation sadder still , studies suggest that the poor spend a disproportionate amount on lottery tickets . Several years ago , researcher Kim Phillips found that in a Chicago suburb with an average annual income of $117,000 , the average household spent $4.48 monthly on lottery tickets . In another Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ households spent a whopping $91.82 per month . Yikes . <p> If you 're spending $90 per month , that 's $3 per day , or more than $1,000 per year . Invested in the stock market and earning the market 's historic annual average return of 10 percent , that money would grow to more than $100,000 in 25 years . <p> Whenever you 're tempted to buy more than an occasional ticket for fun , think twice . Think 146 million times . <p> THE MOTLEY FOOL TAKE <p> SMUCKER 'S SALES <p> For the first time in a long time , J.M. Smucker 's ( NYSE : SJM ) latest quarterly earnings report was almost entirely sweet . While sales were up only 2 percent year over year , earnings per share climbed a surprising 38 percent , driven mainly by lower taxes and decreased merger-and-acquisitions charges . These drivers may not be glamorous , but they worked nonetheless . <p> Of course , Smucker 's still retains its sweet position in consumers ' minds , with strong brands such as Pillsbury , Jif and Crisco . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like gangbusters , they 're rather stable . <p> Unfortunately for investors , stability does n't exactly mean solid returns for investors on one key metric : Return on equity climbed an estimated 2 percent year over year . However , the company 's management reiterated its expectations of 8 percent long-term growth . Half of that should come from acquisitions , with the other half from core operations . We would have liked the company to include its cash flow statement with its earnings report , but it did n't . <p> While Smucker 's has some tasty products , investors could do better than to sink their teeth into this stock . There are stronger , more attractive food businesses out there , including Kellogg 's ( NYSE : K ) , Unilever ( NYSE : UL ) and even PepsiCo ( NYSE : PEP ) . Smucker 's jam may be essential to your favorite tarts , but the company is n't a screaming bargain at recent price levels . <p> MY DUMBEST INVESTMENT <p> HOT AND BOTHERED <p> One extremely hot day a few years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soared past $75 per share , I excitedly ran into town , opened up an account at the nearest brokerage , threw $15,000 at them , and ordered them to quickly buy Microsoft shares so that I too could " get in on the action . " Well , I 'll never do that again ! My big lessons learned are to slow down , think things through , do some research , and stay home in the hot summer . <p>  --  Sally P. , Corona Del Mar , Calif . <p> The Fool Responds : Microsoft did pass $75 per share back in 2001 , but then it split 2-for-1 in 2003 . So that $75 in split-adjusted terms is really $37.50 . Still , as the stock has been trading in the $20s for several years now , you remain underwater . Your lessons learned are good ones , but things could be worse . Instead of having invested in some fly-by-night penny stock destined to go out of business , you picked a growing , world-dominating firm that might reward you well in the years ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ?

If we print yours , you 'll win a Fool 's cap ! <p> ASK THE FOOL <p> What does " time value of money " refer to ? <p>  --  T.R. , Gastonia , N.C. <p> It refers to how money 's value changes over the years . Imagine you 're given a choice : a dollar today or a dollar in 10 years . Naturally , you 'd prefer the dollar today because it 's more valuable . You could invest it , and it would grow to more than a dollar in 10 years . Or you could buy a loaf of bread with it . In 10 years , due to inflation , a dollar will probably only buy a few slices of bread . <p> Stock analysts consider the time value of money when they use " discounted cash flow " ( DCF ) analysis to calculate the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's good to know about it . ) They create DCF models , estimating how much cash a firm will spew out over time . Earnings for future years are then " discounted . " ( The higher the interest rate climate , the higher the discount rate used . ) As a simplified example , imagine that Librarian Supply Co. ( ticker : SHHHH ) will generate $5 next year and you 're discounting that at 10 percent . Take 1 and add 0.10 ( for the 10 percent ) , getting 1.10 . Now divide $5 by 1.10 and you 'll get $4.55 . So the " present value " of those future earnings is $4.55 . <p> What 's a " defensive " stock ? <p>  --  F.R. , Cle Elum , Wash . <p> A defensive stock is tied to a company whose fortunes do n't fluctuate too much in relation to the economy . During a recession , for example , people might put off purchasing cars or fur coats or washing machines , but they 'll still be buying food , gasoline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food , soft drinks , tobacco , energy , pharmaceuticals , etc. , are defensive industries . <p> They 're seen as more stable than their " cyclical " counterparts . <p> NAME THAT COMPANY <p> Send your answer to us with Foolish Trivia on the top and you 'll be entered into a drawing for a nifty prize ! <p> I 'm based in Stamford , Conn. , but Stampford might be more appropriate . <p> Incorporated in 1920 , I do business in more than 185 nations and rake in roughly $5.5 billion per year . <p> I provide the world 's most comprehensive suite of mailstream software , hardware and services to help companies manage their mail , documents and packages . <p> I serve more than 2 million businesses through dealer and direct operations and hold more than 3,000 patents . <p> If you 'd invested $1,000 in me 20 years ago , you 'd have more than $9,000 today . <p> If I were a verse , I 'd be in <p> common meter . <p> Who Am I ? <p> LAST WEEK <p> Based in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1724 , I 'm an international media company with market-leading businesses in education , business information and consumer publishing . <p> With more than 32,000 employees based in 60 countries , I rake in more than $7 billion annually . <p> My textbooks , multimedia learning tools and testing programs help educate more than 100 million people worldwide . <p> My publishing names include the Financial Times , Penguin , Dorling Kindersley , Scott Foresman , Prentice Hall , Addison Wesley and Longman . <p> I also provide data to financial institutions and public information systems to government departments . <p> Answer : Pearson <p> WRITE TO US ! <p> Send questions for Ask the Fool and entries for Dumbest ( or Smartest ) Investments ( up to 100 words ) and trivia to Fool@fool.com or via mail to Motley Fool , 123 N.
