The " miserably antiquated " U.S. cell phones you described in " Downsizing to Wireless " GLOBAL BUSINESS , May 2001 will soon support two 3G nationwide networks as well as other , smaller ones . These networks will provide broad coverage two or more years ahead of similar service in Europe , achieving lower cost and higher data rates , and always-on access to the Internet for PCs , phones and PDAs . Operators in the U.S. can provide 3G without the need to first invest large sums to license new spectrum because CDMA systems , allowed here but not yet in Europe , efficiently use existing spectrum . <P> Will Americans find great uses for 3G mobile capabilities  --  which include enhanced GPS location services with downloadable maps , group messaging and chat , e-mail , games , news , financial activities and Web browsing ? Your pessimistic and downsized expectations may be on target , but I doubt it . <P>  --  Irwin Mark Jacobs , CEO , Qualcomm                 @ @ @ @
