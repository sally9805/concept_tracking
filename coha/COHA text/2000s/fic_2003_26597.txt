Hell at the Breech A Novel Chapter One Dawn crept up out of the trees , defining a bole , a burl , a leaf at a time the world he 'd spent the night trying to comprehend . But what would daylight offer except the illusion of understanding ? At least in darkness you were spared the pretending . Behind him in the cabin where he and William had lived since the death of their parents came the morning stirring of the Widow Gates , the clatter of logs as she arranged them in a tepee in the fireplace . He should have gone and done that for her . Her soft , clucking voice reached his ears . Was she talking to herself ? No , to the dog who 'd had her puppies the evening before . Ever the midwife , the widow had aided the dog as she 'd delivered , with a wet rag cleaning the pups so the bitch would be free to push and whine , the old woman stolidly taking the halfhearted nip from the dog , who was confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear , to learn what she might confide to the dog , but her voice was too soft . Get up and go on in there , he thought , help her get breakfast made . Act like nothing 's wrong . But he did n't . He continued to sit with his feet on the steps as the earth redefined itself around him , same as it had the day before and the day before that and as far back as his memory went , as if this dawn were no different from any other . The ground shifted and twitched with early sparrows ; he studied them on their twig legs , invisible in the leaves until they moved . He remembered walking home from the meeting at the store earlier , his face to the sky , searching between branches for the white globe of the moon . How unlike itself the world seemed at night , when trees lurked dark and hulking and the birds of the day disappeared who knew where . His head had begun to ache . He leaned forward and cupped his palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees . He was in that position when her legs appeared beside him . " Macky . " He turned and looked at her ankles through the bars of his fingers . " I could n't sleep . " " Where 's William ? " " I do n't know . " " Still over at the store , I reckon . " She set a croaker sack on the porch by her feet . The bag was moving . From inside , behind the closed door , there came a scratching . A whine . " How long you been up ? " she asked . He could n't stop watching the bag . " I do n't know . " " You do n't know . " " That 's what I said , Granny . " Her quick hand knocked his hat off . He left it where it lay . " You 'll not snap at me , boy , not after  --  " " I 'm sorry . " His cheeks had grown hot , she had never hit him . She reached for his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved off and stood on the bottom step , facing away from her , gazing out at the just-born yard that lay stretched and steaming before them . The trees were nothing more than trees now and the sparrows just sparrows . " How many did she have ? " he asked . " Six that lived . The runt died . " She stood holding the sack , then raised it for him . He took it from her ; he could feel them moving , hear them crying . " Drowning 's quickest , " she said . " I know . " He heard the widow scraping back across the porch with her cane and heard the door close . Frantic toenails of the dog clicking on the floorboards . As he walked away she began to bark . He went faster , having forgotten his hat , holding the bag out from his side and trying not to feel them or hear them . At the creek he knelt on the big shale rock where he and William fished . Leaves floated past in the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming except for the moccasins and snapping turtles . Once they 'd caught an alligator snapper the size of a saddle , had lugged it in thinking they 'd hooked a log . Then it was sitting on the bank gaping at them , a rock come to life , its shell bony and jagged and mossy green , its head as big as a man 's fist . It kept turning its snout side to side with its mouth open and trying to back up , its tongue a black wormy blob . They could n't afford to lose their hook , but retrieving it seemed impossible with the turtle alive . After some discussion they 'd overturned it and , with great care , cut its throat , dragged it far from the water and left it lying on its back . Next day they 'd returned to find it somehow still alive , its horned feet kicking feebly at the sky , mouth working open and closed . The bag lay pulsing . He put a hand over it and defined beneath the cloth a trembling body no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head  --  eyes that would still be closed , mouth seeking the warm purple teats of its mother . This dog had given birth four times in her life , and until now the old woman herself had done this deed , at first telling the boys she was giving the puppies to a colored family , until the morning they 'd followed her to the creek and seen the truth . She 'd explained then that while they could afford to feed one dog for the purposes it served , her litters were too much . He looked into the creek . Another Mack Burke watched him from the water and they locked eyes and rolled up opposite sleeves and gathered the mouths of their sacks in their fists . He looked away from his reflection and submerged the bag , then loosened his grip so that cold water rushed in ... Hell at the Breech
