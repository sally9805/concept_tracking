For most , it was simply a poignant moment in June 's World Cup . Scoring his team 's third goal to seal a victory over Costa Rica , Ecuador 's Ivan Kaviedes pulled out a Spider-Man mask from his shorts , donned it and danced across the field , to the cheers of Ecuadorian fans . He did so in the memory of teammate Otilino ( Spider-Man ) Tenorio , killed in a 2005 car crash . But Marvel Entertainment executives took Kaviedes ' tribute as their own . For a comic-book publisher , it marked a feat of superhero proportions : in less than a decade , the company had pulled itself out of bankruptcy to re-establish its global brand . " We 've made Spider-Man beloved in even the farthest corners of rural Ecuador , " says David Maisal , a vice chairman of Marvel Studios . <P> Not to mention more locally  --  on Wall Street . Marvel stock has leaped to $20 a share , from $1 in 2000 . The films it produces with studio partners have grossed $3.6 billion . Licensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X-Men , are worth $5 billion in retail sales . Next year could be even better , with Sony 's release of Ghost Rider and Spider-Man 3 . <P> Yet Marvel 's future remains a cliff-hanger . " It 's definitely one of the more  --  if not the most  --  difficult companies out there to forecast , " says Bear Stearns analyst Glen Reid . In late May , just as Marvel kicked off what may be the greatest test of its powers yet  --  a slate of 10 independently financed films  --  the firm stunned investors and Hollywood alike by announcing that Avi Arad , the man behind the Spider-Man and X-Men film franchises , would leave to start his own production company . Not six weeks later , two more key execs departed unexpectedly  --  Tim Rothwell and Bruno Maglione , heads of Marvel 's licensing and international divisions , respectively , perhaps Marvel 's most important priorities . <P> That tumult has some analysts thinking Marvel is prepping itself for sale . " These are guys who 'd be squeezed out by a merger , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock . " A major move would make sense by the year 's end . " <P> What a potential buyer would get is a Marvel unrecognizable from the cartoonish operation it was eight years ago . First , owner Ron Perelman pillaged Marvel for cash and floated $250 million in high-yield debt . The weakened company could n't make the payments and went bankrupt in 1996 . Perelman had also sold off much of the company 's most valuable intellectual property . <P> In 1999 , Ike Perlmutter , who had bought control of the distressed outfit the previous year , hired as CEO Peter Cuneo , who had turned around such companies as Remington , Clairol and Black &; Decker . Under the duo 's guidance , Marvel slowly transformed itself into a conservative but lucrative licensing business . " I always tell people that when you come out of bankruptcy , it 's like chemotherapy . You may be cured of cancer , but you 're still very weak , " says Cuneo , now a Marvel vice chairman . " But then along came Spider-Man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2001 , not only saved the day for Marvel but also set its business model in motion . Because Spider-Man 's theatrical rights had been sold to Sony , Marvel received just 5% of the $400 million U.S. box office . But it raked in millions by licensing the Spider-Man brand , including $155 million from toys in the first year .
