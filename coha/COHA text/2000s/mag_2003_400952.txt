Gallery NAGA , Boston , MA November 8-December 21 , 2002 // When the lines between art , craft and design dissolve , as they certainly do in recent works by Judy Kensley McKie , the aesthetic achievement goes beyond simple beauty and pure function . At times strikingly radiant yet subtle , allusive yet immediate , these objects touch us visually , emotionally and intellectually . Each piece in the Gallery NAGA exhibition displayed impeccable craftsmanship and wit , but also an inner light . As with any great works , these are full of contradictions : figurative and abstract , reasoned and instinctual , childlike and solemn , calming and provocative . They are visually direct , revealing McKie 's inspired color sense and elegant form , yet tap into our unconscious . She cultivates the unexpected , using fantasy , symbolic animal figures and " primitive " geometric abstracted forms in surprising ways . Rendered as one-of-a-kind in wood or cast as bronze or resin limited editions , these 18 works , most dated 2002 , comprised domestic furnishings , ceremonial furniture , outdoor public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall-mounted cabinets and standing chests , each exquisitely worked and richly patterned . Trapezia Chest or LeafChest , made of carved and painted basswood , could easily be the focal point of a room . Loopy Cabinet and Pointing Cabinet , of carved and painted mahogany , hark back to Art Deco but also refer to the tribal arts of Africa and East Asia . Shown previously , in " Objects For Use , " at NewYork 's American Craft Museum ( now Museum of Arts and Design ) in 2001 , McKie 's Lynx Desk , 1999 , cast in bronze with a glass top , is regally Egyptian . Also among the cast objects in the show were a large dark-green totemic bronze Owl Vessel , at once mysterious and witty , and Helping Hands Bowl , formed by clasped hands that somehow also resemble a folded jungle leaf , or frond . Public art has become another realm for McKie . Among the bronze benches for public settings included at NAGA were Cot Bench , made in series , with the fantasy feline 's head set at different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts , and Grizzly Bear Bench , a wonderfully detailed low-slung creature , commissioned by Fidelity Investments for a private campus in California.Ibis Ascending , a metaphorically soaring maquette , represents an 18-foot-high bronze sculpture to be installed in fall 2003 in the Garden of Peace , near Boston 's City Hall Plaza , a site memorializing homicide victims . Judy Kensley McKie , a 28-page paperback catalog , essay by Arthur C. Danto , is available for $12 from Gallery NAGA , 617-267-9o6o .
