Ask Dickie Scruggs about his upbringing , and he says , smiling , " We were so poor that if I had n't been a boy , I would n't have had anything to play with . " Maybe that 's why Scruggs so enjoys his toys today . His private jet not only whisks him to business meetings around the U.S. but also delivers him and his wife Diane to their weekend home in Key West , Fla.  --  or the Academy Awards in Los Angeles . Scruggs has a 120-ft. motor yacht from which he watched the America 's Cup races off New Zealand . And he 's easy to spot in the blue-collar town of Pascagoula , Miss. , as he picks up the dry cleaning in a new $300,000 Bentley convertible . <P> But even before he scored $400 million in legal fees from the tobacco settlement , Scruggs was n't motivated mainly by money  --  or mainly by altruism . " I do like the kinds of cases , like the ones against tobacco companies and HMOs , that can help a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly like the action . I like big , complicated cases against tough defendants that most lawyers do n't want to take on . " <P> Much of Scruggs ' competitive drive comes from his mother Helen  --  still a formidable bridge player at age 89 . She graduated from Millsaps College in Jackson , Miss .  --  a rarity among women in the 1930s . Her husband left when Dickie was five , and she reared the boy while working as a secretary at the Ingalls shipyard . ( My mother worked alongside Helen , and our families have been friendly for 40 years . ) <P> Scruggs ' other formative experience came in the U.S. Navy , which he joined in 1969 after graduation from the University of Mississippi . He recalls thinking that " if I 'm going to Vietnam , I 'd rather do it as an officer . " He won the fierce competition to become a fighter pilot and was assigned not to Southeast Asia but to an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean , where he was on hand for the nuclear alert during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , in case of war with the U.S.S.R. , in which U.S. aircraft would fly beneath the radar of Soviet warships , then pop up suddenly and use antitank bombs to destroy the ships ' cruise missiles . His commander adopted the scheme , and Scruggs had his first taste of plotting to crack defenses that had been thought to be impregnable . <P> After the Navy and law school , Scruggs worked a while for big firms in Jackson but chafed at the hierarchy and soon hung out his shingle in Pascagoula . His big break came when a shipyard worker approached him for help getting treatment for a lung disease that turned out to be asbestosis . Scruggs began paying to have workers tested for the ailment and soon had all the clients he could handle . But he has n't forgotten the days when he had to scrounge . Driving to work recently , Scruggs stopped as an ambulance screamed past in the opposite direction . " It 's hard , " he said with a grin , " not to turn and follow that thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action . <P>  --  By Dan Goodgame/Pascagoula
