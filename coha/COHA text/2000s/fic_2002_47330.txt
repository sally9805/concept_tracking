The setting is a sleepaway camp nestled at the foot of the Green Mountains in Vermont . The camp 's entrance is flanked by twin totem poles stenciled up and down with crudely carved letters that spell the name of the place : INDIAN ACRES . Drive through the gate , and trails fork out to archery ranges , a dining hall , a basketball court . Log-cabin bunks and a sprawling field , home to epic games of Capture the Flag and Ultimate Frisbee . Buoys stake out the swimming area on Townshend Lake , and a water-skiing boat christened Nancy knocks gently against a dock . <p> It 's his best summer , ever . Because he 's met a girl , call her Erica , and she 's made him forget he 's away from home for the first time . Forget that the night before he came , he curled up in his bed and told his mother he would n't go because there were bats there and at night they 'd swoop down and bite out his eyes and when he woke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes used to be there would be only two hollow caves . Soon after , he fell into a deep , uninterrupted sleep , for he 'd emptied all the nightmare out of him . <p> He and Erica circle each other with tentative , painfully awkward stutter steps . Wary dogs introduced for the first time . Like they ca n't decide just how close to get . How close is safe . Every day they see each other . At five , orbiting the bug-juice table , everyone spent from the afternoon 's games , their bangs matted to their foreheads with sweat . He 's not sure why it 's called bug juice ; maybe because frequently there are bugs struggling not to drown on the surface of the pink punch . This summer 's favorite distraction is to blow up mosquitoes . Instead of slapping them away when they land on your arm , you tense up and make a fist , overwhelming them with too much blood . <p> There is a dance at the end of the month , a few nights before everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights even though there 's no sign of winter anywhere , and toward the end of the evening the deejay spins a lot of songs with the word goodbye in them . This will be the right time to try and kiss her . In the dark . After a slow song , something by Journey maybe . <p> When no one 's looking , he practices in the mirror , and he ca n't help thinking his lips look like a fish 's . More real , he thinks . Like in the movies , he tells himself , trying to recall big-screen love scenes , where the adults drift toward each other as if it 's the most natural thing in the world , as if that is what 's meant to be . No one ever trips , no one ever pauses . He 's not ready for the naked stuff yet , just the kissing , though he would n't mind , maybe , a glimpse of Erica in her swimsuit . If someone catches him there , in the bathroom practicing his kissing in the grimy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A special condition , he 'll say . My doctor said I had to . It 's a very rare condition-they might put my picture in medical books . Do n't tell anyone . <p> Let 's say he 's away because his parents are getting divorced . Splitting up . Untying the knot . Leaving each other . Call it what you want , the name does n't alter the situation . They 've tried shrinks , antidepressants , retreats , everything . A second honeymoon and then a third , the stunning pink skies of Mexico and the dramatic coastline of the Riviera obliterated by their trying too much to want each other . They ate meals that set their mouths on fire , strolled on cobblestones the moon polished into gold bars . A barrel-chested man sang an aria at their cafe table while tourists snapped photos and assumed they were happy . Nothing has cured them of the simple hard truth : They are no longer in love . <p> The real tragedy , they both agree , is their son , and they have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll use to tell him . The phrases and sentences to encompass a whole new era of his life . It 's the hardest thing they 've had to do in a long time . Whenever they imagine the moment of delivering the information to him , saying his name and forcing the words out , sickness rises in their stomachs , and they think , Fuck , even these four weeks wo n't steel us . <p> It 's the same story as a thousand others , not that that 's any kind of balm . The spark is gone , home no longer looks like Heaven . Canyons have opened up between them where before the ground was seamless . She thinks he desires someone else , but the truth is that he desires nothing-not even to revisit the years when they could n't get enough of each other , when they had sex wherever they happened to be . On the couch , in the kitchen reckless by an open window , pinned in the front seat of the car on the way back from a concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tape deck was chewing her favorite Kitty Wells album , but she did n't care , she did n't have time to care . The constant hum of cars their soundtrack , the interstate only a shout away . Police cruisers were pulling over speeders , all the wrong scofflaws , because what the two of them were doing felt so good it had to be criminal . <p> She 'll always cherish the recollections of their sex . The hover and lurch , sound and silence . The sweaty aftermath , the slow return to normal breathing , getting back to your own body . True connection , wordless . After language . Along with a beautiful son , he 's given her that much , and it 's something no one can take from her . She 'll never be poor . It makes their unhinging sting a little less . <p> He 'll move to Wyoming , say , or Santa Fe . Or put him in Montana , under a sky so big it should be its own continent . Caribbean blue on days from God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raze small buildings . Somewhere far from the East Coast , where they live and suffer now . The distance will do him good , each one of the thousands of miles a step toward beginning anew . Picture acres freckled with bison and cattle , a man fly-fishing a trout stream , his rod a conductor 's baton , the line silver with sun . Rubbers to his waist so he can wade wherever he wants . <p> Sometimes she looks at him and thinks up unanswerable questions-How have we come to this ? We 're not the same people anymore . She glances at the picture of their son pinned under a magnet on the refrigerator door . His sandy hair peeks out from a Baltimore Orioles cap . He 's got eyes the color of gemstones . His hands are somewhere beneath the frame of the photo , but they 're long and lean , a touch womanly , maybe . Even his harmless beauty ca n't save them . <p> On rainy days the counselors round up all the campers , hustle them onto orange Bluebird buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mall . Choruses of " 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall " reverberate through the interior of the bus , the enthusiasm dying out around sixty or so . Once inside the mall , they parade past teenagers killing the hours with cigarettes and shoplifting , past senior citizens exercising with laps around the fountain . It 's a summer of secret agents , or wars with Russia , maybe tornadoes tossing mobile homes or asteroids hurtling toward earth . When the directors run out of human enemies , they pretend that nature has turned against us . The campers ' fingertips turn slick with popcorn oil , and the older ones defy the counselors ' orders and smuggle Cokes to their seats . They 'll be amped on caffeine and Jujubes all afternoon . Everyone loses themselves in the ninety minutes of noise and turmoil and resolution . Movies will do that-take you away from yourself . <p> The counselors have their own entanglements to sort through . They 're supposed to watch the kids , but for the duration of the movie they can relax . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at the mall , and they 're convinced that no terrorists have ventured out on this rain-soaked afternoon . The only abductions are onscreen . <p> Now focus on two counselors . In the back row . He has concert dates and the names of arenas in California labeling his back ; she has little gold hoops dangling from her ears . They use the cover of darkness to touch and paw . They pretend to be whispering , giggling about the movie , but really they 're kissing , threading their fingers together , letting their hands drift daringly into each other 's laps . Everyone around them , everyone who would see their groping should the lights come on , makes it all the more thrilling . The faces that might spy their lust . Halfway through , in a hushed voice , she says to him , I have no idea what this movie is about , and she has no right , at sixteen , to be so achingly sexy , to know how to change things so fast . Makes him want her more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll sneak into his bed , wedge her body under his , guide him into her . She 'll scratch his skin browned from hours of lifeguard duty , stifling the moans he 's sparking in her . He 'll squeeze his eyes shut , he 'll open them and be awestruck , he 'll hold her and not let go . They have to be nearly silent , because campers are only a thin wall away . Their sex is quick , exuberant , over long before it can turn bad . When they 're done he watches her dress in the dark , her breasts disappearing under a T-shirt , the cutoff jeans with frayed ends she slides perfectly into . The flawless silhouette she 's become . It 's the first summer of love . <p> Archery is his favorite . Then riflery . Street hockey is third , football fourth . Arts and crafts is most definitely last , though once they made sundials , which was cool . This information he shares with his parents on one of the pre-stamped , pre-addressed postcards his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same for a daughter , only she 'd misunderstood and dumped all the cards in the mail the first day of camp , blank . If his parents were the type to worry about such things , they 'd worry about his attraction to weapons and violent sports . But they know they 're not raising a monster . At least they were n't . In a moment of panic , guilt , they 'll wonder whether their son has sensed their impending divorce , and if his orientation toward these brutal games is his aggression coming out-soon he 'll move on to pyromania and Satanism . That 's what the shrinks would say , but they do n't know the son , they 're not in this story . He 's an angel , he 's blameless . <p> There is a competition for cleanest bunk , a ruse to trick the campers into being tidy . His bunk is tied for first place , though the counselors try to keep everybody close . Otherwise it 's pointless . There 's a way to guarantee the hundred points , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside down . Totally destroying the place-emptying all the trunks , hucking dirt everywhere , standing the mattresses on edge , raising a soiled sheet as a flag from the roof . The hundred points is for extremism , the dare of the thing , and maybe to soothe the massive cleanup that inevitably follows . Usually each bunk does this once during the summer , for the sheer fun and mischief of it , the chance to be a slob without recrimination . <p> Now back at home . She tries to be out of the house when she knows he 'll be there , to minimize their hours together , and he does the same . She used to think that to run away was cowardly ; she 's had friends who 've dealt with their divorces by fleeing , and their flights made her lose respect for them . But going through it herself , she understands the impulse , feels it often . The desire to take off , to vanish . Every object in the house , every inch of the house itself , can remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single entity , and berate her for failing . They 've had all those long talks at the kitchen table over red wine . They 've stayed up till dawn , the shafts of morning light angling through the windows one more searing indictment . Even the sparrows sounding sunrise were mournful , somehow finding fault with the day 's unzipping . Hours earlier they 'd run out of things to say , yet neither wanted to leave the room , on the off chance a rescue boat would appear . What is the term ? Communication . It 's not communication at all ; it 's admitting you do n't want to communicate . A friend of hers , call her Anne , says she already has dates lined up for her . " You just let me know the day the papers are signed . We 'll hit the town that night " Anne tells her . " A woman like you ? You 'll be snapped up in a hurry " Anne adds . " I know this great club . Who knows ? Maybe you 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He 's a doctor , a lawyer , an insurance man . He wonders if his patients would trust him less if they knew he prescribed himself antidepressants , if they knew he sneaked some Percodan to take the edges off ; if his clients might go elsewhere if they knew he had a lawyer of his own , for the property dividing and the custody arrangement . He 's only human , he tells himself . Fuck it , I 'm allowed . <p> Memories flood him , Super-8 reels his brain projects inside his skull . The two of them at his mother 's funeral , watching the casket lowered hydraulically into the earth . The prayers , the silence , everyone veiled behind their sunglasses choking back tears . At home he buried his head in her lap and said , " I wanted to dive into the ground after her . I feel like my compass is all off . " Or this : They are dating , in the car after dinner at a Chinese restaurant . She points to the sky because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says , and since he 'll do anything for her , anything and everything , he says yes . The gas needle is flirting with the red zone , but he does n't want to stop , does n't want to lose this moment . They track the dancing light for miles , getting lost , not caring , tuning and retuning the radio , always peering through the moonroof to find their North Star . They arrived at the lightsplashed opening of a used-car lot . A woman in lavender sequins handed out Sterno-heated pretzels , and a man wobbling on stilts saluted them . Magicians , a hundred Houdinis . <p> Now he masturbates to the memory of her , even whispers her name when he comes . He 's not proud of it , but he does it . Fresh from the shower , towel loosely knotted around his waist , in the cloud of the bathrooms subsiding steam . The last part , the name part , feels almost natural . <p> These are the levels in swimming : pollywog , newt , minnow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technically , as one of the smart-ass campers has pointed out , a minnow is a fish . I 'll look into that , was the counselor 's response , now let 's concentrate on those strokes . They 'll learn how to tread water and keep alive under a capsized canoe , bobbing under the boat , breathing in its dark shelter . To right the canoe , put all the weight on one side . Done properly , this should flip it right-side up . <p> They learn survival skills for the wilderness , too . How to start a fire using sticks and rocks and the sun . How to find aloe leaves and split them open to soothe wounds . They learn that snakes with triangular heads are often poisonous and how to fashion a splint using vines and tree branches . Most likely , the counselors say , you 'll never need to utilize these skills . But just in case . <p> She almost wants to hate him , to make it easier . She wonders if it would be better if he were cheating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel ire in her , frustration even , anything other than a sadness as cold and unforgiving as granite . Some hours go minute by minute . They can be short with each other these days , flinging themselves into meaningless arguments they do n't need to have . She knows one couple who got divorced and simply built a wall down the middle of the house , brick by brick . Neither wanted to give up the home . She ca n't imagine-your greatest failure walking the same floorboards , using the same plumbing . What happens when he brings home someone else and screws her and their noises bleed through the wall ? <p> He 's come to depend on cocktail hour , five or so , when you can blame the drinking on the darkening day . He 's considered taking up cigarettes again , but he 's not that desperate yet , and he 's determined to not let this severing ruin him . If he can help it . <p> She deals with the sorrow , say , by shopping . Not clothes but antiques . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . Andirons hammered into American flags and a brass fireplace cover illustrated with a woman churning butter . She does n't need any of this cache , no one needs it . But she needs to busy herself , to somehow keep outrunning the hurt coursing inside of her . <p> Once a week , make it Wednesdays , the campers are allowed to buy a candy bar at the canteen . It 's always a tough choice : whether to go for the quick hit of something like a Snickers or a Three Musketeers , or to go for sheer volume-a Charleston Chew , a Marathon , or the sleek silver pipe of Spree sweet tarts . The hours that follow are filled with bartering , stained tongues , sugar highs . The day the parents come to retrieve their sons and daughters , the canteen will be open all day , so everyone can buy T-shirts and postcards and coffee mugs , souvenirs families feel compelled to own . <p> They play a game at dinner . At some point in the meal the counselor at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . The last camper to follow suit has to clear the dishes and sponge the table . He 's never had to clear . He 's a quiet boy , he notices things . Usually it 's Wiener who loses , at least three times a week . The right pronunciation is actually " Winer , " like red wine , but which is worse ? <p> He has friends , and they 're trying to make it easier for him . They say the things friends in these situations would say , things like " You 'll get back in the game no time " and " In a few months you 'll feel ten thousand times better , and this 'll all be ancient history . " One has suggested a prostitute . " There 's no guilt involved , no attachment . It 's simply a financial transaction . " This friend palms his shoulder , not even lowering his voice . " I have numbers . Mine does things you never dreamed were possible . You ca n't believe how good she feels . ' This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about asking his wife to sleep with him one last time . In a whiskey haze he 's asked for less . One night he found himself at the top of the stairs , unsure of how he 'd arrived there . He wandered into the bedroom , stood just inside the doorway , and asked her to use her hand . " Maybe . just a little , " he slurred . " Just ... I do n't know ... for a minute ... it wo n't take long . ' She feigned sleep , and it was one of those acts of charity that prove you 're still alive . <p> Camp again . Erica has blue eyes , straight black hair . Sometimes she wears a plain navy baseball cap turned backward , and there 's a mole on her neck . No makeup , which is good . It 's difficult to tell if she likes him back , but he thinks so . Girls are hard that way . Some of the boys in his bunk are planning to sneak across to the girls ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tell him , plus it totally freaks them out . They start screaming and shit . Do n't be like Wiener and wuss out on us . But he does n't want to go . What are you supposed to do with a pair of girl 's under-wear , anyway ? <p> Dear Mom and Dad , one of his postcards reads , I am having a lot of fun but I want to come home soon . Remember to feed Travis . Travis is his rabbit . One ear sticks straight up , and one flops down , and sometimes one of the neighbors drops off broccoli stalks for him . His fur is white as paint from the can . <p> What does he listen to ? The salve of music , some raft to carry him away . Long cool strains of jazz , sound stripped of words . Or country music , Hank Williams , because Hank Williams was a poet and every song is about what the world does wrong to you . On the porch , with a Walkman . Add a bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headphones leaking tinny bits of song . He sits in the dark , the only lights elsewhere , yellow dominoes of neighbors ' windows . This is where he goes to lose himself , this is how he wants to escape . <p> Do n't have him shed a tear . It 's a dry , parched sadness . Inside his body he feels flattened , and if they cut him open they 'd find the Sahara . Not like her , who he 's caught crying . Not caught but heard . In her sleep , crying over what they 're about to lose , what they 've already lost , crying because it 's the month of crying . She writes in her journal : Memory 's not the same . Memory can go fuck itself I never knew before pain could be a rash that wo n't quit . The rain reminds her , gardenias remind her . Scrubbing the sink and opening the mail and peeling the lint from the dryer screen and spooning rice into her mouth and each of the hundred thousand enemies a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are driving back from the supermarket , bags of groceries spilling in the trunk . They are stopped at a red light , fenced in by minivans and sports cars , a motorcycle and a classic cherry-red Mustang with a proud teenager gripping the wheel like he never wants to let go . Like he wants to sleep there , sitting bolt upright so no one steals his treasure . <p> When the light changes , the Mustang peels away . He ca n't find the gas pedal . He gropes all over with his foot , but he ca n't locate it . The honking starts . Cars screech out from behind him and into the neighboring lanes , drivers giving him the finger as they pass . She does n't say anything , because she feels it , too . On the corner a couple steps off the curb , as if they might want to help . Then he realizes his right foot has n't been moving at all . Not a centimeter . It 's like it 's soldered to the floor , like he needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas pedal and press his toe down with his palm . Breathe out . Again . Once more . Wait for the next cycle of the light . Miraculously they make it home without crashing . <p> It 's the final night of camp . They have twelve hours to figure out what to say to their son . <p> The last night there is a bonfire . Toasted marshmallows and graham crackers and Hershey bars to make s'mores with . The counselors tell ghost stories and give out awards , making certain everybody gets one . Ca n't have anyone heading home upset . <p> It has n't hit the campers yet that they 'll leave in the morning , all the farewells they have yet to make . They 're too mesmerized with the fire and its generous heat , its crackling , with the mountains gone black in the background , with each other and the myriad bits of the world kids absorb . <p> A storm rolls in to tie the night to a close . It comes on without warning , and everyone scurries under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raindrops lash the fire pit , sizzling , but the flames persist . Thunderclaps detonate overhead , and the littlest children plug their ears and crinkle up their faces . A few rush to the counselors ' sides , hugging the columns of their legs . Then the lightning hits , as brilliant as fireworks . The light show renders them speechless . They watch the white branches freeze the sky , patterns like splintered eggshells . The fearless ones wander out from under the tent of the tree . They 're hungry for a view of the lake below , the serpents ' tongues plunged just short of the water . <p> Under the spell of lightning he relives the moment . The moment he leaned into her , closing his eyes , praying he was doing everything right . The moment their mouths met , her lips pillowing his , the perfume rising from her neck , the millisecond it took for seduction to swallow him . Have her murmur his name , have him rest his hands on her bony hips . The swaying bodies around them disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin mist . The deejay is in another nation , the bunkmates have been murdered . She kisses him back , but it hardly matters , because he has already stumbled , headfirst , his heart bound for love 's ruin . <p> Author Affiliation
